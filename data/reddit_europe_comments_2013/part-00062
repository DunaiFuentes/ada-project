per il vicino... anch'io avevo un vicino con una muta di cani da caccia che abbaiavano di continuo ed i padrone non diceva nulla!!! ho iniziato con le buone, dicendogli che doveva mettere un fine e che la colpa era sua! gli ho fatto anche vedere come si faceva, ma di costanza ne aveva molto poca e poi li rinchiudeva sempre in recinti di 1m.x1m.... questa è stata la mia fortuna! fotografato, chiamato i vigili e l'arpav per un controllo sonoro (era una muta e non solo un cane singolo!!!)... multa1, multa2, multa3 e adesso si è stufato a prendere multe e li ha venduti tutti! i vicini mi portano le torte per ringraziarmi ed'io son contento! il tipo gli ho detto che deve ringraziare qualche santo, perché ho 2 fucili e se non bastavano le multe li avrei usati, non contro i cani però! adesso cambia sempre strada quando mi vede...

i cani sono una gioia ma un grande impegno!!! io non sono un bravo ammaestratore, riesco a malapena di cavarmela... ho 2 miei cugini che hanno uno un'allevamento di cani da guardia e l'altra invece che ha un centro di recupero di vari animali (cani, volatili di vari tipi anche rari, cavalli, poni, asini, ecc...) con corsi di studio per bambini diversamente abili ecc.... tutto quel poco che ho imparato è merito dei miei cugini che sono dei veri professionisti! l'importante e andare sempre da dei professionisti capaci e sta tranquillo che c'è ne in giro! se senti qualcuno che prende un'animale convincilo sempre che il fai da te senza un minimo di base può creare dei problemi nel tempo... anche se sono animali piccoli! ti garantisco che non solo migliora la vivibilità, ma anche loro scoprono degli animaletti che riescono a fare cose che sembrano impossibili e diventano utili anche nella vita quotidiana... ma se uno non può dedicargli tanto tempo sconsiglialo di prendersi un'animale!!!",0,1364777086,null,0,1364777431,0,c960etp,t3_1bdads,t1_c960etp,t3_1bdads,null,1431716455,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

true,Mg112,null,null,"&gt;LONDON—There was a time, as Mr. Banks put it in ""Mary Poppins,"" when the British pound was the admiration of the world.

&gt;It wasn't in the first quarter of 2013.

&gt;Sterling has taken a remarkable nose dive. It started the year at $1.6246 and closed the quarter down 6.4% at $1.5202, after falling below $1.50 for the first time since 2010. It also lost substantial ground against the euro.

&gt;The pound, say investors and analysts, is stuck. Don't look for it to rebound.

&gt;Behind the stumble is a profound shift in sentiment against Europe's third-largest economy—and a signpost for investors assessing the entire Continent's response to its debt crisis.

&gt;What has changed? For much of the past few years, the U.K., despite its own eye-watering debt levels and gaping government budget deficit, had been a haven from the turmoil in the euro zone. Investors pulled out of Greece and Portugal and Ireland and Spain, and they put their money in London. That helped drag U.K. government-bond yields to extraordinary lows. Yields fall when bond prices rise. The 10-year gilt yield dropped below 1.5% last July. The inflows kept the pound strong.

&gt;But despite the recent turmoil in Cyprus, which agreed to a bailout that punishes depositors at its two big banks and had to impose capital controls, the broader sentiment in the euro zone is improving. Investors are a little bit more comfortable spreading their money around Europe. And the drop in sterling is a sign that the haven effect is waning.

&gt;During the quarter, ""sterling no longer had that diversification flow,"" said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank in London. ""Sterling was exposing the full weakness of its fundamentals, and they are weak.""

&gt;What investors see is indeed not pretty: an indebted country with a persistent budget gap and a weak economy.

&gt;The European Union projects the U.K.'s debt to rise from 89.8% of gross domestic product last year to 97.9% in 2014. This year, according to EU forecasts, the U.K. will have a higher relative debt burden than the euro zone for the first time ever.

&gt;The U.K. economy stumbled hard in the financial crisis, and unlike other major economic powers—the U.S. and Germany, say—it has continually failed to recover. Quarter after quarter, GDP disappoints. Last year, the U.K. managed growth of just 0.3%. In March, the government's official forecaster cut its 2013 growth projection in half, to 0.6%. In February, Moody's Investors Service stripped the U.K. of its triple-A credit rating.

&gt;At the same time, the Bank of England has pushed on the monetary-policy accelerator. It has held its main interest rate at 0.5% since 2009, launched successive rounds of bond buying, and deployed a program meant to give banks ultracheap financing if they increase lending to consumers and businesses. The loose monetary policy, in normal circumstances, would signal a weaker pound. For a while, the haven effect propped it up. Without that ballast, the pound has suffered.

&gt;And there is little question the Bank of England will keep policy loose in the medium term. ""During January and February, there was a lot of guidance that came from the [Bank of England],"" said Stephen Jen, who runs SLJ Macro Partners, a currency-focused hedge fund in London. ""They basically talked down sterling, consistently and powerfully."" It slid until Bank of England governor Mervyn King in mid-March pulled on the reins and said he thought the pound had fallen far enough. Mr. King's successor, Mark Carney, who becomes governor on July 1, is, if anything, viewed as more comfortable than Mr. King with loose policy.

&gt;Many market participants are primed for more sterling weakness. Foreign-exchange analysts at Barclays BARC.LN +1.13% PLC have a target of $1.47 in the next few months.

&gt;Jose Wynne, head of foreign-exchange research at Barclays in New York, said reasons are ample for the central bank to keep policy loose, and even make it looser, in the hopes of juicing the economy, even if the strategy hasn't yet worked.

&gt;For one thing, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron and his finance minister, George Osborne, have made plain they don't want to embark on fresh government spending to try to boost the economy.

&gt;For another thing, Mr. Wynne said, it is possible that the U.K. is merely in an extended cyclical downturn that loose money can help end. And even if, as Mr. Wynne and others believe, the problems are deeper and more structural, the extra inflation that results isn't the worse thing in the world; it makes the government's high debt easier to pay down.

&gt;""I don't see a lot of downsides to pushing the monetary-policy envelope,"" Mr. Wynne said. In effect, the U.K. over the years has built up its haven credibility, but now the stubborn economy needs help.

&gt;""This is the right moment to burn some of that reputation,"" he said.

&gt; He noted that certainly, “**this road will demand sacrifices**”, adding that “by leaving the troika and the EMS behind us, we will ensure our national independence, our national sovereignty, our moral integrity and our economic independence”.

As a long time EU federalist, I support this move if the Eurogroup doesn't acknowledge their mistakes now that things are becoming more clear. It goes without saying that Cyprus could have avoided all of this if they had acted sooner, but this treatment was just a bit harsh, and likely illegal overall.

p.s. still not hearing anything about an ""economic kickstarter plan"" or similar. We will need to get people working again ASAP. People having jobs will be more important than purchasing power in the short term. Doesn't matter what 1 euro can buy you if you don't have any. It'll also 'force' people to buy local and likely fix the import/export imbalance (~8:1) way faster. If it makes you feel any better, consider the new currency to be printable food stamps in the beginning. [A bit like this if you prefer](http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lces752ltJ1qahhxwo1_250.gif)

The federalist in me hopes that they make an actual plan to do exactly this and mean it with a hope that at the last minute the eurozone will decide it's better to stop it from happening by changing their crisis policies in general. Not just a bluff, obviously, but actually do it if nobody blinks. It's 50/50, but are we going to wait until a bigger country has problems to see what happens? It really is in nobody's interests for any country to leave the eurozone right now, but Cyprus may have nothing to lose if I'm reading the numbers right (btw - i'm an austerity supporter in the context of not spending more than you have).",0,1364783334,null,0,1364789625,0,c962mg4,t3_1be9cw,t1_c962mg4,t3_1be9cw,null,1431715342,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Like.. try to back up your statements with facts and actually *prove their handling wrong*. At best all we can really say is that having uncertainty in other eurozone countries benefits Germany because they can borrow themselves out of debt through inflation (making it possible for them to drastically reduce their own debt in the medium-term), so the only thing that we can actually accuse them of is trying to benefit themselves at the expense of others (we all do this when we get a chance, which is why we need a change in the way we do shit in the EU). Why would Germany agree to eurobonds when it means that their borrowing costs will at least double? (Hint: they also depend on borrowing money, just like everyone else -- they are just a bit better at paying it off as they acquire it, because lower interest rates always help)

Now what should happen is for more investigation to be done on this and directly accuse them of this.. maybe they public opinion in Germany can be convinced that they have been a bit greedy due to the opportunities the crisis opened up for them. *Maybe*. But nazi calling is counter-productive, it just makes *us* look stupider. We also need to investigate exactly how bailout money ends up being used, because most people are pretty sure it has mostly ended up in various other banks and never makes it to the people of the bailout countries, therefore making a bit of their 'lazy southerners taking our taxpayers money' seem stupid on their end -- but more of a case of losses within the eurozone being contained (ie. paying money to the people who were owed money) which could have started a domino effect in their own country. So at that point you could more or less accuse the german government of misleading their population on what a bailout actually is.

Part of the problem for me if that being part of the Euro and having the bulk of the debt owned by foreign institutions makes it almost impossible to avoid even accepting a bailout since it would have a detrimental effect and nobody wants that.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Long-term I think it would be very important for Europe to have independent man-rated access to space, allowing us to leave this planet sooner than later.

You hear people say this a lot, but it really is pretty silly to consider leaving this planet as some sort of pressing need, or even realistic aim within the next century. The benefit of spending money to protect what we have is so much greater than the benefit of spending money to wander out into the abyss, that it hardly bears comparison. People over-estimate the technological footing of our civilization, and the scale of the respective challenges. Going from our current explorations to self-sustaining settlements outside the Earth is like the difference between going snorkeling, and setting up a city on the ocean floor. We should spend money on developing capabilities in space, but as a very long term goal, and far more money should go on trying to fix problems which are actually imminent, like solving the energy crisis, developing an industrial system which is relatively closed-loop (that would be a necessary precursor to self-sustaining lunar or martian settlements anyway) or trying to cure Malaria, or even Alzheimer's.",0,1364796352,null,0,false,0,c966qlh,t3_1bdb0h,t1_c966qlh,t1_c95yrqn,null,1431713402,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

And do you think they will make it change now? Nope. And I'm not only talking about Zapatero, Aznar or even Felipe Gonzalez, I'm talking about ""la transición"". No fucking one read the toilet paper is our constitution and I'm fairly sure no one is reading it now because it is pretty obvious that protesting we won't change a thing, and do you know why? Because it is explicit written in the CE/78 that to change the most important titles of the Spanish Constitution you need the absolute majority of Diputados and they don't want to change it.

Remember, for example, when they were talking about changing the crown (Title I in CE/78 - to allow womans to be queens, yes, we are still that kind of country) and no one moved a finger, a lot of people went into the wagon and called for a reform, hell event both PP/PSOE had agrements and then vanished, no one cares anymore and the people have forgot about it.

We can't reform anything because we are scared. Spain is still a divided country and if we touch anything we can go to hell, again. I read somewhere in this subreddit an user talking about Italy having ""solid foundations"" even with their corruption, well, we don't have solid foundations, you start changing the country and there is a chance half of it starts a civil war. Sadly this is true and one of the reasons why our CE is shielded in some titles.

&gt;Fortunately, they are starting to know. This is something to celebrate, instead of pointing fingers and saying ""why didn't you protest 5 or 10 years ago?"".

This is funny, same happens with another recent movements and when you passed by you could see party flags, syndicate flags. As long as those thing are involved in reforming Spain I'm going to point fingers, and I'm going to do it gladly, because this is not the finger we deserve but what we need, because if it isn't my finger pointing, who will?

Alcohol, as said is super cheap. E.g. 0,5l of beer at store can go from 20 € cents to about 1 € for Pilsner Urquell (probably the most expensive domestic mainstream beer.) Beer at a pub is usually around 80 € cents to 1.25 € (lower quality pubs, but teens are not going to drink anything more expensive). 0,5l bottle of rum/vodka/etc. can be 4€, 3€ if you are lucky and it is on sale.

true,MartianSky,null,null,"&gt; Is Germany too powerful for Europe?

No.

Economically, Germany is currently in a relatively good position, because its' problems forced it to do reforms much earlier than many other European countries. That pendulum may swing back soon as the painful reforms other countries have to go through now pay off, while German politicians (having learned that enacting unpopular reforms makes you unpopular) are hesistant to enact further reforms. (Angela Merkel is a perfect example of this: she doesn't act unless she feels she has no choice - then she makes abrupt decisions and goes back to wait-and-see)

Politically... well, being OK financially and Europe's largest economy does put Germany in a situation where it's expected to be solidaric with others and to act accordingly. But German politicians also have to protect Germany's interests. This puts them in a difficult position, leading to hesistant and sometimes unfortunately ""erratic"" (for lack of a better word) behaviour. This should not be confused with leadership - it's the exact opposite.

German politicians certainly have no interest in ruling over Europe like many seem to think - there's nothing to win except the hatred of others. Germany is *not* a driving force in this situation - it is being driven (much like the rest of Europe).

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; As a long time EU federalist, I support this move if the Eurogroup doesn't acknowledge their mistakes now that things are becoming more clear. It goes without saying that Cyprus could have avoided all of this if they had acted sooner, but this treatment was just a bit harsh, and likely illegal overall.

Illegal??? How??? Are you saying that it is illegal to not loan money without conditions? 

&gt; p.s. still not hearing anything about an ""economic kickstarter plan"" or similar. We will need to get people working again ASAP. People having jobs will be more important than purchasing power in the short term. Doesn't matter what 1 euro can buy you if you don't have any. It'll also 'force' people to buy local and likely fix the import/export imbalance (~8:1) way faster. If it makes you feel any better, consider the new currency to be printable food stamps in the beginning. A bit like this if you prefer

There won't be any plan, because there is no EU institution and nothing in the EU treaties to cover this. The only institution there is the European Investment Bank, but again they have their own mandate and own rules on which basis they will give loans for investments. And there is no hope that the situation would change any time sooner, for something like this to happen there needs to be EU treaty changes that take years or even decades, not to mention all this would need to be financed by the ECB and not by member states, thus treaty negotiations could take multiple decades.

&gt; The federalist in me hopes that they make an actual plan to do exactly this and mean it with a hope that at the last minute the eurozone will decide it's better to stop it from happening by changing their crisis policies in general. Not just a bluff, obviously, but actually do it if nobody blinks. It's 50/50, but are we going to wait until a bigger country has problems to see what happens? It really is in nobody's interests for any country to leave the eurozone right now, but Cyprus may have nothing to lose if I'm reading the numbers right (btw - i'm an austerity supporter in the context of not spending more than you have).

The only thing that the Eurogroup can do is to loan more money, but this will only by one or two years worth of time, before these loans and loans before them have to restructured in order to prevent uncontrollable default.",0,1364813071,null,0,false,0,c968lgq,t3_1be9cw,t1_c968lgq,t1_c962mg4,null,1431712527,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I would like to know the reason for why the EU can not pay its bills? 

Because there's not enough money to cover all the budgeted and completed programs from 2012. Those commitments cannot be paid without funding in form of payments. That was the original reason they were rolled over to 2013 budget. But the austerity guys in the Council thought that it would be beneficial to make also 2013 budget payments too small to cover that.

&gt; Who is responsible for this? 

[**Council** adopts its position on the 2013 EU budget](http://consilium.europa.eu/homepage/highlights/council-adopts-its-position-on-the-2013-eu-budget?lang=en)    
*On 24 July the Council adopted its position on the draft EU budget for 2013. The ministers agreed that the increase in payments should not be higher than 2.79% compared to the 2012 budget.*  
*In absolute figures, the Council position amounts to 132.70 billion euro in payments (i.e. actual amounts that could be paid out in 2013) and 149.78 billion euro in commitments (i.e. promises to spend money, which do not necessarily have to be paid out in 2013, but can be spread over several financial years).*  
*It constitutes an increase of 3.61 billion euro in payments and 1.88 billion euro in commitments compared to the 2012 budget, but a decrease of 5.23 billion euro and 1.15 billion euro respectively if compared to the Commission's proposal for the 2013 budget.*

Then it was already known that the payments would not be enough.   
And already in Oct 2012 the Commission proposed amendments: [Amending EU budget for Europe's students, scientists, NGOs', businesses and regions](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/news/article_en.cfm?id=201210231543)  
*The Commission has adopted today an amending budget to enable it to meet its legal obligations towards beneficiaries of EU funds. This is in line with the joint statement the Council and the European parliament adopted the day the EU budget for 2012 was adopted inviting the Commission to request additional money ""in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2012 budget are insufficient to cover expenditure"".*

And in Oct 2012 the Parliament's position was: [EU budget 2013: avoid payments shortfalls and invest in growth and jobs](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20121019IPR54020/html/EU-budget-2013-avoid-payments-shortfalls-and-invest-in-growth-and-jobs)  
*To enable the EU to pay its bills in 2013, Council cuts in the European Commission's budget proposal must be reversed, said Parliament in a vote on Tuesday. Reinstating funding for payments in 2013 would help to protect popular EU programmes, such as Erasmus Mundus and the Social Fund, against funding shortfalls like those that disrupted them this year.*

The 2013 budget was adopted Dec 2012 and it was quite clear that the budgeted payments would not be enough and amendments would be needed: [EU Budget 2013 Adopted: Statement by Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget Janusz Lewandowski](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/news/article_en.cfm?id=201212130801)  
*""However I am concerned that the approved budget will in all likelihood not be sufficient to pay the incoming bills. The adopted budget is €5 billion below what the Commission estimates necessary for 2013, and another €3 billion remain outstanding from amending budget 6 in 2012. This means that the pressure on the 2013 EU budget will be tremendous. There is a serious risk that we will run out of funds early in the course of next year. I am concerned that by systematically cutting the Commission's estimates, the Council transforms the EU annual budget in a budget for 9 to 10 months; last year we ran out of cash to pay all the claims in November, this year was in October and next year I expect this to happen even earlier.*

*I can only hope that, building on the amending budget agreed this year, both the Council and the Parliament will honour the spirit of the joint statements in which they ask the Commission to initiate any necessary action according to the Treaty and, in particular, to request additional payment appropriations in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2013 budget prove insufficient to cover expenditure"".*


And now we are here: [EU Budget 2013: More funding needed to cover unpaid claims from 2012](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-291_en.htm?locale=en)

More info on developments here: http://ec.europa.eu/budget/news/article_en.cfm?id=201303191223

&gt; What is being done to correct it?

The budget is being amended to cover both unpaid expences from 2012 and expenses in 2013 (e.g. Croatia joining needs about 1.1 bn more).

&gt; I actually find it rather extraordinary that the EU apparently are so bad a budgeting, that they need extra money all of a sudden.

Not ""all of sudden"". 

&gt; What more - I am afraid that if they get extra money now, it will become a ""habit"" and the EU will not longer care to balance its budget (which they are supposed to do, but apparently don't do).

The amendmends *are* about balancing the budget: payments should meet the commitments. Postponing the payments indefinitely does not work.

Germany is Europe's largest country by population and has a stable economy as well. So yes, it's more influential than its neighbors, but that's not disproportionate.

Germany also had a high deficit and high unemployment 10 years ago when it went through something of a recession. This forced unpopular but necessary reforms which carry fruit today.

Then there's the financial crisis, which Germany, thanks to its largely production-based economy, weathered comparatively well. It's not that Germany doesn't have strong banks, but they aren't nearly as important to the overall economy as say in Britain, Ireland or Cyprus.

Now Germany is trying to ""force"" other countries to perform similar reforms it had to do a decade ago. This wouldn't be so harsh if it wasn't so many countries needing to do it at once.

The financial crisis has exasperated the flaws with many Southern European economies who, until the introduction of the Euro, relied on heavy inflation to compensate for their debts. But with the ECB maintaining the 2% inflation goal regardless, the PIGS needed a more ""sound"" economy to sustain their standard of living.

What is happening now is a forceful adaption to an economy that isn't financed by high inflation any longer. This was inevitable with the introduction of the Euro and has nothing to do with Germany.

true,finisterra,PORT,Portugal,"A very decent question, and one which I had to dig around a bit to find! I found most of the answers in Portuguese media, but see bellow for further sources.

The overall idea seems that there is no real difference in terms of actual use; there is a lot of political posturing concerning this policy so most sources are biased one way or the other, but overall the number of hard drug users seems to be little affected by the policy. Now, one must consider that the main opposition to the law was that it would fuel a brutal increase in drug addiction and turn Portugal into a ""drug haven for drug tourists"". This hasn't happened. Additionally health indicators such as HIV infections in drug users have been drastically reduced. Some important social results have been possible, mainly because many hard drug users have little to no family support, are homeless, etc, and the mandatory counselling includes Social Services that can make a difference.

One idea I got though was that decriminalisation by itself is not a magic bullet and that it is mostly concerned with ""damage reduction"" - it is not a prevention measure. It is a heavily politically charged issue and most sources tend to be somewhat biased.

Personally though, one big different I have noticed was perception... Lisbon during the late 80s/90s had some spots that were unbearable, with drug trafficking made in broad daylight, people roaming around looking for a fix, horrible stuff. That being said, and now that most if not all of this places have been reconverted, perhaps the reason things look much better was because people were all sent to city projects and others can't see them :(

While searching around I have found some interesting data by the EMCDDA (coincidentally based in Lisbon). Amidst all the turmoil and ill-will that the current crisis makes manifest I find that these organisations are one of the most visible proofs of the advantages of European integration (for different values of integration, not making a federalist plea!). Hope this provides some additional ""hard numbers"", although I found no information comparing drug usage over a decade or something like that:

&gt;Because there's not enough money to cover all the budgeted and completed programs from 2012.

So, obviously the EU has adopted programs that they can not afford. Not to be obtuse, but who is responsible for that? I mean, it is the first thing one should look at - can we do this? 

So, what programs are there, and who miscalculated the costs? 

&gt;The amendmends are about balancing the budget: payments should meet the commitments. Postponing the payments indefinitely does not work.

But that is in no way a guarantee that it will not happen again. Obviously, the EU is good at having programs that they can not pay for. So, what is the EU doing to make sure this does not happen again - that the programs will be covered for by the budget. They haven't even pinpointed what went wrong, so how can they in any way say it will not happen again.

I mean, how will they learn if you can just force countries to pay more for your ill planning? 

&gt;payments should meet the commitments.

That goes for the EU as well, doesn't it? Countries have paid, countries have met *their* commitments. Why can't EU do their part? Perhaps they should cut back on stuff then, not ask their countries to pay for what is the EU's mistake.

The programs are based on budgetary commitments, which on turn are covered by actual payments to the budget. Now the situation is that the payments do not meet the commitments. You could start by looking at the Council and it's decisions during last years (for more information see the link in my previous post).

&gt; But that is in no way a guarantee that it will not happen again.

It isn't. That's why the Parliament has been raising a stink about it regarding the MFF 2014-20 too.

*The resolution highlights the growing problem of payment shortfalls, which prevent bills being paid and jeopardize EU programmes. Last year's shortfalls meant that several important EU programmes, such as Erasmus, the Research Framework Programme and the Social Fund ran out of funds early in the year.*

*Parliament insists that the issue of unpaid bills from 2012 must be settled before concluding the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) negotiations, as agreed in last year's budget talks. Parliament also wants a political undertaking from the Council that all bills falling due in 2013 will be paid in 2013, so as to avoid ""rolling over"" a deficit into the new MFF. The EU cannot legally run a deficit.*

&gt; Countries have paid, countries have met their commitments.

Well, there's problem. Countries have made commitments but not paid for all those commitments. Now it's 2013, the last year of MFF 2007-13 and budgetary commitments should be met with actual payments.

Well it's a little suspicious that the ECB policies only make sense in the context of the Euro being the a new DM. If you limit yourself to Germany the policies they pursue make sense. But they are a horrible central bank when you look at the Eurozone. 

Central bank independence is important, but so is democratic oversight. The US strikes a good balance; central bank independence is a matter of law, laws are hard to change but can be changed. The ECB though really is an autocracy being run out of Frankfurt. Like a military they have a lot of power. That power can be used for the purposes of keeping on their targets (which they are horrible at) and it can also be used to stage a coup and coerce the ""civilian"" governments that they aren't even on paper supposed to be loyal to. So they threw out an Italian government they didn't like a couple years ago - look at how well that worked.

**EDIT:** I would have hoped the following to be obvious, but because of the sensitive nature of the subject, I should perhaps make it abundantly clear: There was never any (Jewish) conspiracy to exterminate the German people after WWII. While that is perhaps a well-beloved meme in Neo-Nazi circles, it has no connection to reality.

What did exist was a thought experiment that went quite far in reducing Germany to a pre-industrial state (the Morgenthau plan), and at least one instance of a ""revenge plan"" by a small group of Holocaust survivors (see the link to jweekly). The latter was most likely an isolated case, and in any case was never sanctioned by any authority nor is there any reason to think it would have gained public support in the US or Israel. I simply mentioned it because of HallenbeckJoe's remark:

&gt;I'm not aware of any serious plan for a postwar Germany that included its 'total extermination'.

which I essentially agree with, but wanted to add two ""non-serious"" plans that perhaps served as the inspiration for the alternative history scenario of this post.

**EDIT 2:** Just saw that you found the source for the map. So it appeared first in ""Germany Must Perish!"".

Solche Töne von türkischen Politikern klingen immer ziemlich anmaßend und das sind sie oft auch. Über den NSU, das ""*Versagen*"" der Behörden und das damit einhergehende Misstrauen verlier ich hier gar nicht mehr viele Worte. Das türkische Politiker darüber hinnaus ihre eigene Agenda haben ist auch klar.

Ob in Backnang oder Köln-Höhenberg, technischen Defekt oder zündelnde Kinder im überfüllten Hausflur - es ist offensichtlich wer meistens in den unsanierten Häusern und Wohnungen mit maroden Leitungen leben muss. Über Gründe für gesellschaftliche Ausgrenzung kann man dann natürlich wieder ewig diskutieren ohne irgendwas zu erreichen. 

Grund zu Sorge und Misstrauen gibt es jedenfalls genug. In Backnang sieht das dann so aus:

&gt;Am **17.10.2003** verübten fünf Nazis einen Brandanschlag auf das Haus des türkischen Kultur- und Jugend-Vereins in Murrhardt, 15 km von Backnang entfernt. 

&gt;Am **15.10.2005** gab es einen Nazibrandanschlag auf auf das Haus einer Flüchtlingsfamilie in Unterweissach, 5 km von Backnang entfernt. 

&gt;Am **06.11.2005**wurde das Flüchtlingsheim in Unterweissach angezündet und anschließend von der Stadt geräumt. 

&gt;Am **30.03.2008** gab es einen Nazibrandanschlag in Backnang auf ein mehrheitlich von TürkInnen bewohntes Haus. Die Bullen erklärten, dass die Täter keine Nazis gewesen sein könnten, da diese die Hakenkreuze nicht verkehrt herum auf die Hauswand gesprüht hätten. 

&gt;Am **19.05.2009** wurde das Haus eines türkischen Einwanders in Backnang angezündet. Die Bullen schlossen einen Nazibrandanschlag bereits am Folgetag aus. 

&gt;Am **10.04.2011** verfolgten 20 Nazis in Winterbach, 25 km von Backnang entfernt, drei Italiener und fünf Türken und versuchten fünf ihrer Opfer in einer Gartenhütte zu verbrennen. 

&gt;In der Nacht auf den **25.08.2012** — genau 20 Jahre nach dem Pogrom von Rostock-Lichtenhagen — brannte ein Flüchtlingsheim in Stuttgart, 36 km von Backnang entfernt. 

&gt;Am **10.03.2013** starb die Mutter und sieben Kinder einer türkischen Großfamilie bei einem Brand in Backnang.

Auch in Köln mit immerhin 2 Bombenanschlägen die dem NSU zugerechnet werden und anschließend monatelange Überwachung der Opfer durch die Polizei, weckt ein (vermutlich) angezündeter Kinderwagen und 2 Tote eben Angst.

Also, then we know it is 27 ministers. I think it should be important that a newspaper/journalist mapped out who voted for it, and why, and also for how long. Obviously, the ministers have decided to vote for something that the EU can not afford, not caring one single bit about the consequences. It is extremely important that we know which ministers that did that, and ask them why.

Still, I do not see any reason, at all, why the individual states should pay to cover for *the EU's* mess. I mean, the indivuidual states *have* done their part - it is up to the EU to do theirs. Honestly, how irresponsible can they be. Start programs that they can not afford, and instead of cutting back or changing, they just ask for more money. We have all seen how well that work for states (irony), and letting the EU get away with that sort of behaviour is not only wrong, it is a clear moral hazard. It is a very slippery slope, and it should stop here.

In fact, it is all rather easy. The EU fucked up, so they should fix it. Asking someone else to cover for your mistakes is wrong, both as individual, states, or organisations. The EU is most certainly heading down the wrong road for doing that. It is sad however, that most people do not seem to get that, but think the countries should just pay up, and get angry with the UK, while it is so clear that it is the EU that have messed up.

true,finisterra,PORT,Portugal,"Yes, we had an authoritarian government for a good part of the XX century - many would call it fascist although this is somewhat disputed. It was partially a result of the instability of the Republic and partially because it followed similar movements across all Europe at the time. During the 1930's it was almost given as a certainty that strong nationalist, authoritarian right-wing governments were the only option to ""Bolshevism"", hence the popularity of it. The local brand of nationalism and imperialism was centred around Salazar a bit to much for the regime's sake, apart from that it was a mix of integralism, imperialism, corporativism and authoritarianism.

Still, you mention one important point (and note that I come from a family of anti-fascist fighters): there was no systematic genocide involved. There was persecutions, people died, but it was not something either common or systematic. The closest I can think of was the prologued war in Africa, but I do not think it should be seen as similar at all, regardless of the death toll. Still, I'm not saying that it couldn't have happened, especially when we consider that we were doing something similar centuries before, with blood cleanliness laws and mass expulsion of Jews, public burnings, etc.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Ie the executives of national governments decided not to cover commitments with payments.

So, then they should take the responsibilty for that. They are not - they are saying that the nations have to pay for it. That is one way, but there are several other ways too - as in cutting down on other programs etc. There is no law that say the money has to come from the EU member states. Also, the *Council* should be the one who asks for money, not the EU. And, they should each and every one of them go out to their individual nations, explain why they voted like this etc. Also, I would really like to know why the EP went along with it. 

Still, I see absolutely no one in the EU taking responsibility for it. Shame on them!

&gt;&gt;Who, when and how should have foreseen the Council's position? And how should the spending be planned: according to commitments or according to foresight of the position the national executives might take in the future?

What? Are you saying it is impossible for the Council to a) change its position? b) have, as a guide *to only implement programs that they can afford*? 

The spending should be planned as a budget, of course. Sweden has managed to balance it budget for over a decade, as well as myriads of other countries/organisations/states/counties/companies/regions etc. Are you saying it can not be done?That it is impossible for the EU to do what myriads of others are doing just fine. Of course the EU can do it, but they do not want nor do they care to. 

Of course it can be done, the Council however choose to be extremely fiscal irresponsible (something I, and a lot of other people have come to connect with the EU) and *if* they vote on that, they should be bloody sure that they can a motivate it for the fact that the programs are of such extreme importance (which is hard to do when you spend 40 % on CAP) and that the nations agrees to this. Obviously, they have failed on both accounts. 

To me, this is one more reason that the EU is extremely fiscally irresponsible and truly do not even attempt to balance a budget. And, another reason we should give as little as possible, the EU is apparently not even attempting too, they vote for programs that is not covered. Who, apart from extremely fiscally irresponsible people does that?  And, I think we are just going to see more and more of it too. I would be furious if my government did something as irresponsible like this, and I am certainly not going to accept it from the EU (and, we might very well have, I have no idea how the Swedish commissionary voted, but I am sure as hell going to find out).

All in all, the EU is showing again how little they care about fiscal responsibility, and this time at the highest level. ",0,1364839648,null,0,false,0,c96e622,t3_1beua3,t1_c96e622,t1_c96dphr,null,1431709829,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

true,multubunu,ROMA,România,"Some trivia and legends for the Romanian bits

* The Palace of Parliament in Bucharest, formerly *House of the People*, is much larger than the pictures make it look. It is sort of a large scale model of itself, it's proportions make it look more human-scale.
* It is built on a small hill in the middle of a large space. The space was obtained by demolishing most of the historical area of central Bucharest, including a hill called Dealul Spirii (once near the river) and the 16th century palace on top. Rubble from the former hill is now the hill on which the current Palace resides. At the time, the joke went 'Since *he* couldn't become a historical figure, *he* tried Geography).
* The Unirii Bld. (*Unification* in the article) was originally called - in the same bombastic style - the *Victory of the Socialism* Bld. The same jokers added *over the entire people*, otherwise a stereotypical phrase of the Wooden Tongue.
* The Unirii Bld. was built on space obtained by demolishing large parts of former middle class neighborhoods. The style is said to mimic North Korean architecture. However, this effect seemed to have been obtained not so much by architect study, but by Ceausescu himself having construction of a single block finished each week, then remade after his weekly commentary upon viewing (on Saturdays, 8-9 am if memory servers).
* The *House of the People* was designed by four teams of architects, a quadrant each. I have some anecdotes from a guy who worked as a model maker with one of the teams. Apparently, a couple of floors ended with no access, which had to be provided on the spot while building the thing. Some floors were misaligned (vertically), I understand this was never fixed (meaning floors are not in the same horizontal plane around the building in some sections). There is an 18m tall WC somewhere (if you use that, don't fart). Several architects died of heart attacks during design and construction.
* During area design, a model of the whole area would be presented to Ceausescu, who would pick model buildings and move them around a bit, then ask for the whole thing to be redone. This resulted for example in mindless crosses such as [this](https://maps.google.com/?ll=44.428615,26.101167&amp;spn=0.001446,0.00327&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.428615,26.101167&amp;panoid=VTf_tAlESXuAn5kpWB9jvg&amp;cbp=12,263.15,,0,22.08). However, digs were started as soon as architects draw the plans, and had to be filled/redone to fit the weekly changes. It is said that someone had the idea of gluing the blocks on the area model, and Ceausescu - who had never asked for movable blocks - finally approved the model as it was.
* ""Hunger Circus"" was a joke name for the structures. They were built at a time when all the shops were empty, and were believed to be intended to become large canteens, to ""solve"" the food shortage problem (i.e. you wouldn't buy and cook your own food, but eat whatever would be provided there). According to the urbanistic plans, they were supposed to be ""markets containing a dining area"".
* The first picture of ""blocks of flats"" is the most representative. Take a walk around [this area](https://maps.google.com/?ll=44.414186,26.142975&amp;spn=0.023267,0.052314&amp;t=m&amp;z=15&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.414186,26.142975&amp;panoid=aPWzTNcgiJImxkSQvl7UZg&amp;cbp=12,38.88,,0,-5.41) (not the worst blocks-neighbourhood in Bucharest).

&gt; I guess I'm just confused by what  part of the behaviour is different, regardless of the word used.

The actual process of getting involved is pretty similar. That's what I was trying (kind of) to get at. It is the language which seems to create a difference in how these things are perceived. While the English language heavily stresses the word ""date"", there is no real German counterpart for it. 

Instead of ""We had a date"" you name the activity, e.g. ""We went to a restaurant."" You can also say ""We went out"" but this isn't used as much. I'm only guessing here, but for a German the heavy use of ""date"" in different contexts might give the impression that there is this rigid, formal process of dating someone (""we had our first/second/third date"") while in German you just ""went to a restaurant"" or whatever three times in a row. 

That may be why Germans tell you they don't date, meaning that they don't have this (what they assume to be a) fixed process of getting involved with someone.

You can read on for some of the history of it. There were many layers to it. Hindenburg was not really a democrat, but old military. Which made Hitler hate Hindenburg (even moreso when Hindenburg initially refused to appoint in as chancelor). I guess Hindenburg both was putt off by Hitler's lack of aristocracy, saw him as Parvenu, as populist brute. Maybe as necessary evil to ward of the evils of communism.

true,keepthepace,FRAN,France,"In France, my understanding is that a protest must be declared to the police but does not have to wait for authorization. It can, however, be forbidden.

Typical example : On May 1st, far-right organization organize a protest on the same day as unions and a lot of far-left organizations. They are usually authorized, but the police refuses any declaration that would imply the two crowds to be too close.

The last protest that was forbidden in France (this is fairly rare!) was the one against the shitty movie against Islam. The call to protest proposed a path that would come close to several embassies, this was after the US' ambassador death. I still think that forbidding it was a bit heavy-handed, but could accept that it was appropriate.

I am actually of the opinion that protests are a sign of an immature democracy. I would prefer a system like Switzerland's where referendums can be called by petitions. It has much more impact.

Protests just mean that a few thousand people are angry and this is seen as a valid reason to block roads in already over-crowded streets. In the kind of two-party system that is currently emerging, having 40% of the population unhappy is seen as a normal features. In this context, protests serve no purpose.

Actually, it is part of our culture to dream that a big enough protest can trigger a revolution. I think it is a bad dream. Our democracy should get over its teenager crisis and propose responsible means to citizens to express themselves.

Make referendums on retirement, nuclear energy, gay marriage, NATO coming back, Libya and Mali wars, and be done with it.

true,Ooftyman,UNSA,United States of America,"I think, at least in my family's case, it was the realization that pre-war relationships between Jews and Czech (and German on my mom's side) Christians were pretty amicable. Let's not forget the thousands of German Christians that were martyred protecting Jews--Dietrich Bonhoeffer most notably. Silent (or silenced) objectors are typically drowned out in favor of nutcases in the history books because their stories are deemed more 'sexy' to tell.

Ashkenazi Jewry, as a general rule, was far more laissez-faire before the Balfour Declaration--particularly among the observant. This was the very reason most of orthodoxy rejected the UN partitioning plan, and protested Israel's formation at the outset. Of course, we could discuss why that's changed (unfortunately, in my opinion) from a strictly theological perspective, but perhaps that's for another thread..

It's called ""Picollo Italia"" and their homemade tiramisu is AMAZING. If you're in Place Daumesnil, you'll see a pharmacy on one corner and ""Au Metro"" restaurant on the other (it has a big burgundy awning), walk up the street that runs between them about one block and you'll see it on the corner. It's nothing super fancy or spectacular, but you'd be remiss not to eat some of that Tiramisu before you leave! 

Also - my favorite bar in Paris is The Experimental Cocktail Club near metro Reamur-Sebastopol...just go in and say ""surprise me with a [insert favorite liquor here] cocktail, please!"" the bartenders know what they're doing...it's amazing. It's like a speak-easy, and it's amazing. 

On a really nice day before you leave, I'd also recommend this little greek grocery place, I don't think I ever knew the name, but it's on the street Rue Lagrange on Rive Gauche just near the notre dame - like a block south of the quai...so...either way. You can go in and get a mixed wrap (one meat ball and one aubergine ball) and a soda and some baklava for like €6...then go sit on the walls of the river and wave at tourists on the boats. My friends and I would do this all the time after our classes at La sorbonne.

I ate and drank a lot in Paris, but those the three things I did the most and had the greatest times doing them! I hope you enjoy your last two months in Paris! 

EDIT: I can't believe I forgot to mention this: if you walk down Ave. Daumesnil towards the park at the end (which is also great fun on a beautiful day, by the way - they have peacocks on the islands and you can rent a bateau! Definitely recommend it...) you'll pass by a bakery on the corner of Ave. Daumesnil and Rue Sidi Brahim that is one of the best bakeries I've ever been to. The Faugasse (this bread pizza awesomness thing) is AMAZING. If they have the one with chorizo, go with it! It's the best! Then get a brownie for desert....or you could get it to go and then to go get tiramisu from the italian place and then go to the park....here, let me just plan your whole afternoon! hahaha ;) But no seriously...enjoy it! The ""tradition"" baguette at that bakery is beyond amazing  - every dinner party I ever went to, my friends wouldn't let anyone else bring bread, because they wanted me to bring the ones from there!!

Even in 2003, 14 years after reunification, unemployment was much higher in the socialist part of Germany than in the capitalist.

The same is with the rest of the socialist block countries and especially wth Russia.

Indeed, Soviets managed to concentrate huge resources to resolve some particual problem. And at some tasks they succeeded. But given the amount of resources thrown and the state of the economy in general — it is completely wrong to call it success.

It is very hard to start a business or anything else because you have to pay for everything and you don't have the protection others have.

Also a lot of youth people leaves the country hoping to find something anywhere and a few months later they come back... there were news about it, about a youth Spanish guy living in the streets of some country and how they left him to die (he lost some fingers due to freeze if I recall) out there while in Spain we would spend public money to save his life.

/u/axtolip talks about corruption and all that is bad of course but it's not only that. It is also the people fault. We could have used European money to transform some of our industry into something else (for example, miners in the North) but the politicians rather spent in on people (and themselves ofc), they spent the money in the miners kids (huge scholarships), instead of spend on miners to start new jobs and now that the mines are a waste of everything (money - always had, but now every euro matters - people health, we are not gaining anything with that coal) they are complaining while there had almost 30 years in which they could have complaining and they didn't because ""FREE EUROPEAN MONEY!!!!!111"" (Edit: Which I've explained before but we joined the Union lying for this same reason, free European money, without thinking in how it would affect us in the future)

It's not only our politicians, it is our fault too (not all of the youth fault but still, I consider myself responsible in part)

Neither does this analysis: [The Cyprus Debt: Perfect Crisis and a Way Forward](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2233239)

&gt;  Abstract:  
The Cyprus crisis is one of the most complex in the Eurozone - although in absolute terms it is a minor crisis. An analysis of the ongoing developments from different perspectives leads to the conclusion that we are witnessing a 'perfect crisis' at the confluence of sovereign debt and banking crisis together with debt overhang of business and households and a severe decline of competitiveness. As a result CY has amassed a large external debt that can not be repaid, no matter what fraction of the country’s real domestic economic output is appropriated through austerity measures. Hence, fiscal austerity leads to deflationary stagnation and alone does not work. **We advocate a policy response that addresses multiple dimensions of the problem with policy options of (1) austerity deleveraging, (2) structural reforms, (3) financial innovations, (4) partial privatizations and (5) debt restructuring.** These options are drawn from lessons of what worked well, and what not, in crises of other countries and these lessons are summarized in lieu of conclusions. 

It seems likely that Cyprus will need restructuring of public debt. Soon.  
And Cyprus will likely need a second bailout package. 

Cyprus gov's current foreign debt consists mostly (80%) of short term loans which are due 2013-15. The previous government borrowed in short term to cover gov expenses, and to avoid making reforms and budget cuts. At least those short term loans will likely need to be restructured preferably soon (Russia's loan was already extended).",0,1364889540,null,0,false,0,c96uq7f,t3_1bhaj7,t1_c96uq7f,t1_c96q18m,null,1431701943,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

* the other cities or towns like Tarragona, Cadaqués, Girona, Figueres (where there's the [Museu Dalí](http://www.salvador-dali.org/museus/figueres/en_index.html) if you like his art), Palamós, Vilafranca del Penedès, Delta de l' Ebre (where Ebre river flows down into the Mediterranean

* any other town along the beach Costa Brava (north) or Costa Daurada (south) usually has a nice beach (I'd say better than Barcelona's). It's won't be hot enough to get into the water (unless you are brave enough), but still a nice place to spend a couple of hours


* Near Tarragona there's Port Aventura, an amusement park, but I guess there also amusement parks where you live; 

* the mountains of Montserrat or Montseny

With the bikes you can go up to Tibidabo and enjoy the views or ride along Barceloneta, Vil·la Olímpica,...(beach) or all the way up/down Avinguda Diagonal (with bike lanes)

About the Barça matches, there isn't any game scheduled on any if those days.

* On the 6th there's Barça - Mallorca but pretty late at night (10pm-12am). 

and if you are willing to pay quite a few to see Barça play, 

* There will be a Champions League match (competition within european teams) against Paris Saint Germain on the 10th at 8:45pm. Should be an interesting match, nevertheless

At manufacturing and high-technology?  Absolutely.  This has nothing to do with white supremacy.  It's a statement of fact that's supported by any cursory look at scientific publication rates, patents, and where truly-high tech manufacturing and design is currently taking place.  Nothing to do with genetics.  Everything to do with education, capital funding and creativity.

&gt; Tell me, what do we make that they don't? What can't they manuacture?

Manufacture is only one aspect of the design and build process.  However, in terms of what they don't manufacture, it's pretty easy: there is no Chinese answer to e.g. a Rolls Royce Trent 1000 turbofan, a piece of equipment that's taken the best part of a century of continuous tinkering to design and build.  There's myriad examples like this: truly high-tech equipment is almost certainly, without exception, being designed and built in the Economic West.

Note, even in your Apple example, it's only manufacture that is being done in the Far East.  All design is done in the West.

&gt; Redditor underestimate communists states and are not afraid enought.

It's pretty easy to underestimate communist states, since without fail they've been a complete and utter disaster throughout most of the twentieth century.

It had all the chances to turn into a normal western-style republic where citizens had certain rights, liberal laws and an independent justice system.

Now come the bolsheviks and slaughter even those, who helped them to get to the power. They even resort to using chemical weapons to mass-murder own peasants.

You do not seem to understand. A lot of countries, informally, agreed upon this. It was wrong, and against the treaty. No one has the right to not to obey to a treaty, ""just becaue Germany and the others knew it and were OK with it"". 

Treaties are negotiated, and made, *so there are rules* So that everyone will know them, and that everyone should strive to follow. them. 

So, if you say it is OK not to follow the rules, just because *some* of ther countries are aware of it, you must agree it must go for all the countries, all of the time - not? 

So, any country can then break the Maastrich treaty, as long as they do it openly, and if some of the other countries don't care to enforce it. Does that go for every treaty the countries in the EU has signed. Then no one in the EU have to follow any rules -ever.

Imagine if that whole region was broken down into hundreds of countries the size of Luxembourg or Liechtenstein, all of whom hated each other and all of whom were less than friendly with each other. The whole Balkans situation is a mess. I like to thing that Kosovo should be able to self govern, but then where does it stop? You can't let every man and his dog claim independence.

If I had to decide I'd support Kosovo, but it's an uneasy support as I know the logic behind it leaves me open to hypocrisy.

additionally, I'd really like to see better relations in the Balkans and maybe even some sort of union like the Benelux or even a reformed Yugoslavia. I also think that if eventually all of the Balkans became part of the EU, that either the EU's veto system would have to be reformed (along with huge other areas of the EU) or that they would need to share sovereignty better between themselves.

You're right in that it does not model effects of an Euro exit in Cyprus - merely states it as unavailable and cites related literature.

&gt; The first one does, but it mainly says that it is unknown what would happen and that the effects cannot be underestimated.

Unknown? If you read the modeling part you'll find their results:

*The effect of mild devaluation in just two sectors.  
Combined impact on GDP will be over -8%, and that does not take account of inflation and other issues such as instability  
When all issues are put into account a fall up to -15% as the worst case scenario would be possible, if unlikely*

And that's just effects in two sectors - petrol and electricity. And then there's the problem of unstoppable inflation among others.

&gt; I wouldn't say either of them completely disagree with an Euro exit, they just dismissed taking the possibility seriously. 

Based on their modeling their very clear conclusion of an Euro exit is: A bad idea, and a bad outcome.

&gt; Probably because they still want to pay their debts. Obviously an Euro exit would have a default going along with it.

To the contrary both advocate restructuring of public debt - even to the point of ""Paying off all of government debt in full is insane"".

true,Mordeth,NETH,The Netherlands,"Not really similar.

The mortgage tax benefit was introduced as a means to stimulate house ownership, way back when. In those days, you took out a loan, and each month payed some back plus the interest on the remaining debt until, after 20-30 years, you had payed off the entire mortgage. The tax benefit meant you payed the least at the start of your mortgage and the full un-subsidized amount near the end. Which corresponds neatly to your average spending budget: low at the start of your career, higher near the end.

But it wasn't long until the banksters found a way to profit from it. They introduced new types of mortgages, in which you *did not* pay back the mortgage for the duration of the loan, but only interest. To pay off the debt at the end, they introduced a linked savings account so that the end of the run you payed back the entire amount with the money in that savings account. This meant the bank earned way more on the high interest you kept on paying, the consumer actually payed *less* than with a similar old-fashioned type of mortgage since the interest was tax deductible and the government was footing the bill.

This lead to consumers being able to afford mortgages they couldn't afford before. And this, inevitably, led to higher house prices. Houses are worth what you're able/willing to pay for it, anyway.

The next step was not saving for the full amount of your mortgage. Why plan on paying back 100% of the original debt, when you ""know"" your house is going to be worth eg. 25% more in just a dozen years?  So people took out a 100% loan, payed only interest, did not pay back any and planned to save only 75% at the end of the run. The remainder would be financed by selling off your house at an expected much higher market price.

This is why the Netherlands has such a high mortgage debt.

And then the bubble burst.  Houses suddenly didn't sell much higher; people did not get the profits they had counted on in order to pay back the mortgage. So they either got stuck with an unsellable house, or had to sell with a loss and remained indebted to the bank.",0,1364903263,null,0,false,0,c96wc8b,t3_1ag26c,t1_c96wc8b,t1_c8x81f6,null,1431701113,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

And the EU did very little to discourage this and in fact, prior to the EURO crisis and in answer to the Lehman crash, the EU told EU governments to increase spending in all areas, including social. Now the EU is set on the reverse. But the countries with the fragilest economies are choking with debt, which I consider odious, and unsustainable interest rates. The economy is dying out and everything is being given through privatization at garage sale prices. Growth isn't coming back, not without a major setback or hitting rock bottom. 

Why would the EU do this? Would you attribute this to economical immaturity, tough luck? How can an economic powerhouse for 60 years, with plenty of institutes, regulators and auditors not self-diagnose itself? 

I suspect it was all pre designed. A fatally wounded EU is bleeding billions into the pockets of a few. Follow that money and you'll find the attackers. Hurt the interests of those who profit from someone else's misery and regain control of the economy.

Why is it nonsense? Every western nation has had to deal with their overspending during the boom years and I'd guess Spain is no different.

In Denmark, our minister of finance announced that ""we could buy the world if we wanted"" and similar nonsense was heard and done *on all levels of society*: The political and economical elites (as you mention), the hustlers who made fortunes and lost the all on speculation, the middle class who became millionaires sitting on the asses because of an insane housing market and even the ones who didn't own anything, because they were able to finance their overspending with quick and easy loans with no security needed.

Bottom line is, every body partied and we all deserve having hangovers. Only thing I think is truly unfair is the generation gap of the crisis. To me, it would make more sense if you complained about your parents generations getting rich on real estate instead of the 'corrupt political castes'.

In general I think people all to easily forget they actually have part responsibility when the politicians fucked up simply because *they voted them in* in the first place. I know it's much worse in Spain than up north and that the suffering is greater for you than for me - but a few beheadings (figurative nor literally) as the only way to deal with the crisis is just a very irresponsible approach to a problem that is way more complicated than it is sometimes made out to be.",0,1364906785,null,0,false,0,c96wxg7,t3_1bhep3,t1_c96wxg7,t1_c96vfkd,null,1431700835,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

I think you are well-intentioned and realistic, *but* after enough years/generations in a country with at least a basic democratic exercise and political exigence, it's easy to underestimate the amount of corruption and incompetence that *can actually exist*.

For example, I presume the UK forbids (or at least the political parties take reasonable steps to forbid) people who have been tried and convicted from holding offices, at least on the duration of their convictment. I also tend to presume that people who are closer to being illiterate than they are to being an *average* student usually don't get promoted to high functions in their parties or the political structures they occupy, unless they actually have something strong going for them (e.g. excellent organizatorial skills, sharp thinking, great strategists). I have only seen fragments of debates in the UK Parliament, and while not all of your folks are amazing speakers, they can at least speak their native language correctly. They're probably not the brightest British people, but not necessarily representative for the most imbecile specimens of your region, either.

Breaches to these two basic things are not ""known to occur"" where I lived, *they are the rule of thumb*. It's easy to attempt to ""be the change"" when you at least have one of the state powers along with you, but that didn't happen. Any attempt at being some sort of a change was stopped early and promptly by the law courts. Ironically, even the special organizations that (with full EU support!) are supposed to act *against* corruption are internally used as political devices, and the EU observatories play in such a different league and assume such a higher level of democratic and political culture that they literally seem to ""not get it"". This doesn't help with the average Joe's perception of the EU, who seems baffled that such a supposedly important institution can be tricked like this, and is left with no choice other than to assume that they're actually helping the corrupt government to screw them even harder.

People like me or axtolip aren't demanding fools who think the grass is green wherever we don't live. I am perfectly aware that power and corruption come hand in hand, and I know corruption is anywhere I live -- but in the place where I *used* to live, they weren't an unwanted pair, they were symbiotic organisms.

Furthermore I assume, that your husband did like the german breakfast  so much is not (only) because of the food, but because of the ""flair"". Let me explain this:  
So you get up and of course the breakfast table is already done because of the hardworking hausfrau who got up even earlier :P, so you just take your seat and enjoy that smell of freshly brewn coffee and boiled egg. Then you look around: you see different types of bread and baked goods, some jelly and again different types of sausages and cheese (nowadays some sliced vegetables aswell - cherry tomatoes, cucumbers...) 
So you start a nice chitchat with your family/mates at the breakfast table while creating your individually own breakfast. If you want, you could say it's modular based. You probably won't eat the same combination of bread and spread twice. You try to combine this with that. It's like inventing - and we germans do really like this.

La cosa che ho sempre amato del fumetto è come sia caratterizzato da dialoghi serrati e azione senza fronzoli: le cose succedono e succedono in fretta, un colpo di scena dietro l'altro. E poi si può dire che è molto coraggioso: Kirkman non ha mai paura di menomare, mutilare o uccidere un personaggio chiave amato dal pubblico (questo da solo può anche non voler dire niente, ma io trovo che più spesso che no le sue scelte funzionano, quindi apprezzo).  
Al contrario nella serie televisiva ho visto un ritmo insopportabilmente blando, dialoghi infiniti, scene e situazioni dilatate che più non si può, ma soprattutto mancanza totale di coraggio, sostituito da un appisolamento sulle classiche dinamiche televisive che ""funzionano"" (es.: il triangolo amoroso).
