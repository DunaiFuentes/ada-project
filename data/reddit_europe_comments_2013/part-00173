Edit: I am referring to Target 2.  In June 2012 the debt of the crises countries to ECB was **1,1 trillion Euros** through Target 2 and ELA.   The Spanish debt alone was 350 billions. Greece's debt was 110 billion. Also- Greece has received 100 billion through ELA.   Also- does anyone know how much debt has been created through ELA- Emergency Liquidity Assistance? 

Fascinating that there seem to be no interest in Target 2.  Who else can get that deal- anywhere.  

Edit 2:  Why downvotes for facts? Please everyone, check out Target 2 and ELA, they are not in this calculation.

Don't just go to any pub - try the traditional ones. Very good traditional German food there, too

Altstadt is famous for having a high density of bars and pubs. If you want to move you can just go next door and order your next beer.

Other stuff to do in the area: Go to [Burgplatz](http://goo.gl/maps/8eywo) and the the [Schlossturm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Schlossturm.jpg). From there you can step down to the Rhine river and walk to [Rheinturm](http://goo.gl/maps/t1H50). Try going on top of it to have a great view over Düsseldorf.  Next to it is an old harbour-area. It got remodeled to accomodate media companies. The built little towers by Frank [Gehry](http://goo.gl/maps/X8j20) there. Might be worth checking out if your dad is into that stuff.  

Very famous Dusseldorf thing, too: [Königsallee](http://goo.gl/maps/Rjn1N). If you walk on the east side between Theodor-Körner-Strasse and Steinstrasse you will see all the luxury brand name clothing stores. It attracts a lot of people, especially on the weekends. Even if you don't go shopping there - it's a nice street and might be worth checking out, too.  

Of course there is a bunch of museums, a concert hall, opera,..., too. That stuff is easy to find online if he wants to go there. And there is a lot more stuff to do in Düsseldorf (the stuff I described is just in one part of it...).  

If he hops on the train for 20 mins he can go to Cologne. He can check out the [cathedral](http://goo.gl/maps/NPsZT) there which is right next to the main station. I like walking up the 350 (?) steps up on the tower to enjoy the view and see the cathedral from the top. Of course you have to see the interior, too. The remains of the three magi are there in a nice shrine. And the cathedral is just huge. Other than that I don't really like Cologne and don't recommend spending too much time there, especially if he's in Düsseldorf already.

&gt;Thats simply a load of bollox

Which is not true.

Hence why I posted statistics showing you that the wage growth in southern countries wasn't bigger and that the wages aren't high. The other southern countries aren't anywhere near the level of western europe and can't even be compared. Portugal and Greece have salaries on the level of post-communist countries.

Since you didn't bother converting, the average Swedish wage is 4107 EUR. More than double that of Italy, which is the most affluent of the southern countries. Now tell me with a straight face the south is paid too much.

&gt;The crisis didn't cause the southern institutions to fail, they were trainwrecks from the get go, hence the spending binge in some countries.

After the initial crisis in the US and the blowback hit that most of EU took, the southern countries were experiencing growth again and debt levels were decreasing.

Then, *during growth*, during recovery from that hit, without citing any reasons, the biggest credit agencies all of a sudden turned their credit ratings into junk. Making their entire system collapse. Just the same way your system would collapse if all of a sudden you went from AAA rating to junk. You'd have to repay heaps more than you do now, and it would be unsustainable and perpetuate a crisis.

And yes that would be seen as a spending binge as well. Because when you're dumped into junk rating, the cost of debt grows enormously.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt; Why should pedestrians move ""more quickly""?

Lights are used because the area would otherwise be bogged by people travelling to different directions. 

If we have a normal crossing where two roads with pedestrian walkways on both sides cross, this means we need 

-Time for cars to go forward

-Time for cars to turn left or right without hitting pedestrians or cars driving forward 

-Time when the lights are yellow

-For pedestrians to walk across



And the lights have to turn quickly enough that people don't lose patience and overrun them. I hear that at least in Finland this is marked in splitting one minute into seconds and then seeing how many seconds are given to each. 

The fun thing is, that the wider the road, the longer pedestrians need to cross it. And usually wider roads mean more cars wanting to use it. So too much green on pedestrians increase the proability and length of the rush hour. Of course, rush hours are possible even if the roads are less wide, but then the speed limit is lower as well and again; probability of rush hours increases.

So, if we can shave ""needless seconds"" from one and give it to ""those in need"", we improve traffic and make it more pleasant.... for cars.

The question (and perhaps this is what you were asking?) is why should we prioritise cars over pedestrians? Pedestrians usually LIVE on the area where they walk, it is their home grounds, while cars are just going from place A to place B, and the place with the lights isn't either. Shouldn't the area be a pleasant place live, rise children and grow old? Too short pedestrian greens cause increased amounts of deaths on the road, when walkers START their journey over the road on green but can't complete it in time. 

So, in effect, this is a question of allocating seconds in the best way possible. The thing is, what ""the best"" is, of course, a political question. Is it more important to have a pleasant area on which to live or walk, or more important that cars can get away from the area in the fastest time possible?",0,1377073551,null,0,1377158210,0,cbs6aeq,t3_1kqwha,t1_cbs6aeq,t1_cbrrsxr,null,1429754019,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; ?

Well for example what happened to Poles...

&gt; The Soviet authorities regarded service to the prewar Polish state as ""crime against revolution""[23] and ""counter-revolutionary activity"",[24] and proceeded to arrest large numbers of Polish intelligentsia, former officials, politicians, civil servants and scientists, intellectuals and the clergy, as well as ordinary people thought to pose a threat to Soviet rule. In the two years between the invasion of Poland and the 1941 attack on USSR by Germany, the Soviets arrested and imprisoned about 500,000 Poles. This was about one in ten of all adult males. The arrested members of the Polish intelligentsia included former prime ministers Leon Kozłowski and Aleksander Prystor and Stanisław Grabski, Stanisław Głąbiński and the Baczewski family. Initially aimed primarily at possible political opponents, by January 1940 the NKVD's campaign was also directed against potential allies, including Polish communists and socialists. Those arrested included Władysław Broniewski, Aleksander Wat, Tadeusz Peiper, Leopold Lewin, Anatol Stern, Teodor Parnicki, Marian Czuchnowski and many others.[25] The Soviet NKVD executed about 65,000 imprisoned Poles after kangaroo trials.[7]

&gt; The number of Poles who died due to Soviet repressions in the period 1939-1941 is estimated at at least 150,000.[8][9]

We shouldn't also forget all those peoples who were shipped to Gulags in Siberia, they were essentially to die there. In Baltics and other occupied countries Soviets essentially made intellectual decapitation of these nations by killing all the more prominent members of their societies, thus softening them for colonization or designating them as vassal states. 

EDIT: This is even worse...

&gt; In 1940 and the first half of 1941, the Soviets deported a total of more than 1,200,000 Poles in four waves of mass deportations from the Soviet territories,while in Poland the Nazis and their collaborators murdered ethnic poles who opposed German rule. The first major operation took place on February 10, 1940, with more than 220,000 people sent to northern European Russia. The second wave of 13 April 1940, consisted of 320,000 people sent primarily to Kazakhstan. The third wave of June–July 1940 totaled more than 240,000. The fourth and final wave occurred in June 1941, deporting 300,000. Upon resumption of Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations in 1941, it was determined (based on Soviet information) that more than 760,000 deportees had died.",0,1377076142,null,0,false,0,cbs6ngf,t3_1ksddi,t1_cbs6ngf,t1_cbs6itp,null,1429753848,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Well, horrendous lack of freedom for one thing, concentration camps and repressions for all who disagree with the Communist party, creating a society of constant mistrust where everyone is being watched by everyone else to see if they're suspicious; for most of the time, you couldn't  migrate freely within the country, for example, if you graduate as a doctor/dentist, you cannot chose where you work, you work where you're allocated by the government; you cannot buy yourself a home anywhere you want; if you want to buy a car, a TV set or anything like that, they put your name on a list an you had to wait for months, sometimes even years - especially for cars - before you get yours; oh and do you think you could choose what type of car you get - forget about it, there's some one responsible for planning the economy who chooses that for you. Even in places where you could chose for yourself, there was an extremely limited  choice of consumer goods.

About what you're saying: you can invest a lot more money than you can afford to push up your GDP; but at some later point you have to pay the price for that. That's what I'm saying: there was some progress, but the economic development model of planned economy was unsustainable, therefore it crashed. Factories were destroyed because they were inefficient and once in competition with other countries in the broader European market, with no government protection, they failed quickly.

Buying bread in France is a daily affair, and the bread itself is a joy to eat.  Buying bread in Australia is a once in 3-7 day thing, depending on when you run out, and admittedly it's just a normal, never-think-about-it thing until you travel somewhere like France.

You see, in Australia bakers are required to add preservatives to bread, so they keep longer.  Australia also doesn't have a tradition of bread and pastries like France, so while there are artisan bakers, many outlets just pump out standard recipes and for consumers it's more about square, white loaves.  The health conscious go for the browner breads, and that's about it.  Slowly things have been changing, but we don't have a depth of tradition.

France has that tradition, and breads are made more with care and attention than rising agents and preservatives.  The French *have* to buy their bread more regularly, as it ages much more quickly.

&gt;This visit will make international headlines - probably even more negative. Because on Tuesday Strache  got a visit from Geert Wilders, leader of the right-wing nationalist Party for de Vrijheid (Party for Freedom) in the Netherlands. The white-blonde-enemy of Islam did not spare praise for random fighting FPÖ leader. Strache had more in common with the Party for Freedom than with the rest of the Dutch Parliament, Wilders said. But in an interview with AUSTRIA he denied to be a campaign gimmick for Strache: ""I do not interfere in Austrian politics."" However, he emphasizes the very next sentence: ""I would choose Heinz-Christian Strache, he would be a good Chancellor for Austria. ""(see interview).

&gt;Strache and Wilders   want cooperation
At the meeting concerned a possible cooperation between the two right-wing parties at the EU level, confirmed both Wilders and Strache: ""It was about more democracy, the common struggle against Islam, against the accession of Turkey and   cooperation with other EU parties . ""Strache and Wilders have big plans. You want to achieve electoral cooperation with other right-wing and anti-Islamic parties in May 2014 until the election of the European Parliament. As a partner Wilders sees the far-right party of Marine Le Pen in France and the separatist and nationalist Vlaams Belang, Filip Dewinter. Wilders: ""We want to own International.""

&gt;Dutch right-wing populist Wilders about the meeting:
""Islam opposite of freedom""
AUSTRIA: How was your meeting with Heinz-Christian Strache?
Geert Wilders: Excellent, we had not met before, yes. Mr. Strache is a strong, likeable person. I enjoyed the conversation very much.

&gt;AUSTRIA: What were the topics of conversation?
Wilder: It was about a possible cooperation in the next European Parliament elections, but also substantive things, to strengthen the nation-states in the EU, more civic participation at European level and the risk of the Islamization of Europe.

&gt;AUSTRIA: You see a threat from Islam?
Wilders: I'm proud of my culture and the culture of Europe, and is dominated by Christianity and Judaism. I have nothing against individuals, but against the ideology of Islam. For me, freedom is the opposite of Islam. And against the spread as an ideology we must fight. There are many parties who see it that way.

&gt;AUSTRIA: And the Freedom Party is one of these parties? How do you want to cooperate with you?
Wilder: We want a partnership for the forthcoming EU election. The Social Democrats and the Conservatives have an International at European level, we want such a thing. But this meeting was only the first.

&gt;AUSTRIA: There are right-wing parties that share your settings - are excluded?

Depends of what you mean with partially. Will they perhaps pay back some of it, 15 years from now to a super low interest rate, then yes. Otherwise, no. I mean, the debt/GDP is 170 % now and a negative growth. I think  one hardly has to be an economic wizard to see that they need a) another bailout b) debt reduction. Germany/Merkel is just trying to stall it to after the election.

And, they will get it, and the costs will be transferred to other European tax payers, ECB etc. I am also guessing that Greece will get new, cheaper loans, again. 

&gt;And, of course, because the IMF can't contribute to future bailouts if it can't at least half-plausibly pretend it will get payed back in full.

I think that they have given up pretending that they would be paid back. It is like the ECB in ELA gives as much weight to Greece's government security as to Germany's government securities. IMF can just do the same, and pretend that they are equal. 

&gt;Of course, there are several reasons why nobody will talk numbers yet

They're already taxed much lower than working people anyway, they shouldn't complain.

&gt;Now lets see what happened: The EU (in this case Germany) lent money at self cost to Greece, where they could have invested it and profited from it.

1. Some piece of news comes out (typically reported in one of the tabloids Ekstrabladet or BT) about how Denmark is not what it once was; most of the time it's got something to do with muslims.
2. A random spokesman from the Danish People's Party explains how the damn muslims should be kicked out and eating pork and drinking Danish beer should be mandatory for everyone.
3. The Social Democrats respond by saying exactly the same thing in a slightly more politically correct manner.
4. Meanwhile, the more serious news sources investigate the matter and discover that everything has been blown out of proportion; no one cares, though. We all pretend the serious news sources don't exist.
5. Some agency does a poll showing voters jumping ship from the Social Democrats to the Danish People's Party citing lack of trust in the agenda of the Social Democrats.
6. Social Democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt grows another facial wrinkle and lets the Social Liberal Party deal with the serious politics.

Here's an indicator that the article really captures modern day Germany quite well: I noticed that the parts I disagreed most vehemently with (being German myself) were actually relatively minor inaccuracies, but such that they provoked a strong reaction in me.

Example: the article's characterization of the German university landscape as ""pretty good universities in general, but there exists no *outstanding* one"" is not entirely correct (there's quite a bit of top level research being done in Germany), but it's also not *entirely wrong* (Germans seem to be reluctant to really create and fund one or more ""elite"" universities -- Exzellenzinitiative being a minor step in that direction). Being in academia myself, this situation hurts a bit to think about, and the way the article raised this point got to me a bit, I guess.

I would gladly recommend this article to anyone who's interested in getting an impression of contemporary German *Zeitgeist*, and in particular how (some, maybe most) Germans feel what their place is or should be in the European project.

Anyone from the States  can spend 90 days in Schengen without a visa.  So there would be no problem for you to travel Europe before you get your visa. 

What I can't answer: If you spend the full 90 days in Schengen before you visa I have no clue if you would still be able to travel 90 days after your visa. Or if you did 30 before do you get only 60 after??? Once you arrive there will be many other exchange students in a similar position that should be able to help.

I do know it is easy to reset the 90 day limit. Just leave the treaty countries, visit the UK or Morocco. You only have to spend the day, get your passport stamped, and the 90 days resets.

No! They were not repressed by ""Red Army"" **Soldiers**. They were politically controlled by the soviet government. The monument which was defaced does not honor governments or the soviet leaders, but the soldiers that gave their lives fighting for their (and other) country during the WWII. And yet people hate and disrespect their memory even though they died before the war was ended, before the Chech Republic came under Soviet rule.

Typical Brainwashed Westerner Ideology bullshit where since the cold war, you have been comparing the Soviets to Nazis! Look upon thyselves and thine actions before criticizing others! Funding Genocides in other countries, starting wars upon countries that were turning communist, Creating internal disputes and destabilising entire Nations for your own good!

The Nazis were all about mass extermination (and enslavement in the case of slavs) of races. They killed people on the ideology that some were inferior to others because of their race. The complete opposite ideology of the Communists which was that everyone is equal regardless of race and gender.

The Soviet Union lost 20 million people in this war which we did not start (14m of which were civilians). They took on the most toughest forces of Germany during that war. And yet people feel like it is unfair that they imposed a certain political rule over a country after preventing its own destruction.

Yes, the Soviets commited War crimes in greater numbers than the rest of the Allies (all of whom are guilty of of the same war crimes). But that is because there were way more people involved in the war on the Eastern Front than that of the West. More people=more crime.

Also, after Italy signed [an armistice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_Cassibile), the US Army and other allied armies fought shoulder-by-shoulder with the [Italian Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Co-Belligerent_Army) and partisans against [Nazi occupiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Achse) and their [Fascist collaborators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Social_Republic).

Yeah, so what? This doesn't influence the rational expectations of the participants **within** the system at all.

If you want to see an example of this, look at the [pork cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_cycle). It is clear that the fluctuations are bad, but even then, if everybody does what is rational, the fluctuations occur. Proven in 1994 by [Rosen, Murphy and Scheinkman](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2138619?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102572837407).

&gt;Who is going to buy all that stuff? Asia, Africa, America? 

If there's trade, obviously somebody *wants* to buy. That's the very definition of trade.

&gt;Why would they be able to sustain trade deficits where we can't? 

Trade deficits can be alleviated by tourism of the exporting countries in the importing countries, for example. Germany and China are prime examples of that.

&gt;Even if they can sustain a trade deficit indefinitely (by printing dollar for example), we're just giving them free stuff.

Ever thought of a dynamic instead of a static solution? Some decades, it's country A with the deficit, B rakes in the surplus, after a while, the pendulum swings in the other direction.

&gt;You ignore the mercantilism comparison, because that's just what it is: export more than you import. 

Read up on mercantilism, please. To export more than you import is a symptom, nothing else. I don't see anything which characterizes mercantilism in the current situation here.

&gt;Last time we tried that it just caused a huge economic depression for exactly the same reason. 

Yes, and it might come again and be unavoidable, see pork cycle.

&gt;Beggar-thy-neighbor policies are economic madness, and that's ignoring the geopolitical dangers.

Please give concrete examples of this. Not by showing *symptoms* like inbalanced trade, but by showing dirigistic *root causes*.

&gt;I'll repeat: the only sustainable long-term policy is balanced trade.

Won't ever happen, the only realistic variant of this are fluctuations over time, where deficits and surpluses switch from A to B and back.",0,1377100475,null,0,false,0,cbsbuf5,t3_1kq347,t1_cbsbuf5,t1_cbs7zl7,null,1429751425,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Italy, which had been in the Axis, left it with the Armistice in 1943, and the Italian Royal Army became ""Co-Belligerent"" on the Allied side (but not formally **with** the Allies) against the German troops occupying Northern Italy.

It's also important to point out that the fact that Germany has been able to save money in lending costs during the crisis is not part of any nefarious profiteering scheme. It's a reflection of the global market's recognition that Germany has its house in order, and in the midst of an extremely turbulent time for the world economy, investors see German bonds as a safe place to park their money.

I posted here because I wanted quality options in Italian to expose him or her to your language.

I have no intentions of doing so, both my parents and my wife's parents were firm but they let us do our own thing and grow and learn at our pace and if we can live up to the example set to us, our kid will grow up to be mostly ok (though there's chances he or she will be a bit of a geek). 

The main reason why I want options of shows and literature in other languages that I don't know is because of the way I learned English. Neither of my parents speak it, but after being exposed to TV shows and magazines (and my dad ""reading"" English to me as well as he could) I learned it pretty much on my own and can't honestly remember when I started to speak it, so if I could do it, maybe my kid will also pick it up, if he or she wants to. 

That said, I did get chances to practice English (living close to the US) and once I got to high school I finally had classes in English. If he or she chooses to learn another language, it will be critical to find a place to practice.

[According to the law](http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1996/en19960396) the animal has to be unconscious when its throat is slit. Regarding animal welfare as long as the law is observed its inconsequential what magic words the butcher mumbles if any. 

In halal it's acceptable to stun the animal first and then slit its throat. Which is how the slaughtering is commonly done anyway. So from animal welfare point of view there's no difference. And as an additional requirement it's mandatory to have a veterinary officer present when doing a 'slaughtering method applied for religious reasons'.

The requirement of stunning is also the reason why it's not practical to do kosher butchering in Finland without breaking the animal welfare law. Yet to try and accommodate the wishes of jewish community a compromise was made in the law:
&gt; Notwithstanding the provisions set down in section 42(1) above concerning the stunning of an animal before bleeding, **if required by religious reasons bleeding may be started simultaneously with stunning**, in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. 

So if one was to do kosher butchering it would be possible at least in theory if one invented a safe method of *simultaneously* stunning and bleeding the animal and the Jewish community would accept that as kosher.

Personally, even as I am an ignosticisist, when I lived in metropolitan Helsinki I preferred the halal butcher's shops over supermarkets because:  
1. Better quality and better service with reasonable prices.  
2. From animal welfare point of view halal has a bit stricter controls than regular industrial butchering, the butcher gets to be picky when choosing animals, and the butcher spends time to calm the animals after their often stressful journey to the slaughterhouse.

* Privatization of water, which is now 5 times more expensive than before, same for electricity, gas, etc.
* Privatization of banks, then getting an IMF loan to bail-out those private banks due to bad loans during the real estate boom
* Removing of subsidies, which resulted in further losses of jobs
* Trade liberalization with the EU, now over half of our food is imported.
* Economic exile for three to four millions of Romanians who can't find a job here.

I think you’re missing boq’s point that, for more and more Europeans especially of the younger generations, the language barrier already *is* gone. Europeans communicate to each other in English. It often isn’t a very sophisticated version of English, but it is English nonetheless and it allows a proximity that in that past was inconceivable. 

&gt; the cultural transaction is, for the non-Anglophones, entirely one directional.

Honestly, it’s one-directional for Anglophones as well: the US consumes its own culture and very little of anybody else’s. The obvious exception would of course be things like Harry Potter or Downton Abbey, i.e. works that became huge hits *internationally* – so that doesn’t speak to any particular US-UK closeness.

&gt; While Italian American, Irish American, and African American are all accepted terms, the idea of being English American is tautologous – the Americans by default are English, only a deviation from that need be noted.

That’s… just a historical issue. The US was born as a British colony. British people moved to the US as settlers long before the later tides of immigrants from places like Germany or Italy, killed the native population and established themselves as the founders of the USA. That doesn’t mean that in the intervening 200+ years the two countries haven’t diverged considerably. 

Honestly, I’m a Greek/English binational in a relationship with a Canadian and, despite the fact that arguably Canada is *way* closer to Europe than the US, yes, there are considerable differences that set us apart in ways which simply cannot be compared to the relationship between Europeans of different nationalities – I would argue even the North/South divide that people make such a big deal of is irrelevant in comparison with the trans-Atlantic cultural clash. 

&gt; I just don't think this is an attitude shared by all that many Brits. To my mind the feeling of cultural dislocation is what drives the move towards an EU exit, and I think this notion is not widely understood on the continent.

Agreed. But that isn’t a reflection of actual, real-life differences, but just a divide that exists in the head of prejudiced jingoists which has been fuelled by an irresponsible press and populist politicians. Nationalism has passed the dinner test in the UK, becoming part of Europe feels like losing power and being subsumed by a greater entity, while desperately clutching to the US’s coat tails fuels our self-importance by allowing us to vicariously rule the world like the huge international power that once was. But none of this means we’re closer to Americans than we are to Europeans – it just means we’re really deluded.

The problem with measuring in deciles or similar units is that they dont translate purchasing power increases. For instance the top income decile in the US is almost double France. Because the lowest decile is slightly lower, but the top decile is much higher, this means one has to have a much larger income jump to move one decile in the US compared to other nations.  

For example if someone gets a $20,000 salary increase in the US and Australia, both of their purchasing powers increase relatively similarly. Yet the one in the US might move up one or two deciles whereas the Aussie might move up 4 or 5.

It gives the illusion it is much harder to move up in the US. If you take the fact that median income is one of the highest I think the picture becomes less dire than reddit will sometimes have you believe. The fact is to get to the top in the US you have to become very high income by global standards. That is not the case everywhere. US deciles are larger, so even if you move less deciles, it does not necessarily mean its harder to increase your financial well being than anywhere else, or even that you're at a disadvantage. In terms of financial well being moving up does not appear to be more difficult than other places. But moving up deciles can be more difficult because they are larger. In terms of deciles or similar measures, ""up"" just happens to be much higher in the US than other places.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Romania's economy grew very fast and it brought Romania from a country that had a near-medieval quality-of-life to a reasonably modern country. 

But starting with mid-1970s, Ceaușescu wanted a bigger and bigger share of Romania's GDP to be invested in those factories that were closed down after 1990. Initially, he did the investment using foreign loans, then he got IMF involved, then he wanted to repay everything, while keeping the investment high, at the cost of the standard of living...

More people need to realize this. I love plenty of government-run social services. But you can't fund government spending without economic growth, and *many* - not all, but many, European nations have economies that are not conductive to economic growth for a variety of factors, from excessively pointless regulations, to outdated labour laws, to issues with education and birth rates. That last one - birth rates - is particularly ironic - Europeans don't have enough children to support their social model, and then complain about foreign immigrants coming to their nation. Unless Europe wants to end up stagnant like Japan, Europeans need to figure out better ways of integrating, not demonizing, immigrants into European society.

Governments in the Eurozone can't print money to fund spending (which is often a bad idea anyways) because they don't have their own currencies. They have almost no monetary control over their eocnomies, so they must rely on fiscal tools. With the economic slump, they can't raise more money via taxation. And, due to a lack of faith in said governments, they often can't borrow money at good rates (this does not apply to every European nation, but it does apply to many of them). Given that, what choice is there but austerity? Forced collectivization?

It stuns me how many people in /r/europe rail against austerity without having any viable alternative to it. Austerity *isn't good*. The name austerity implies that. Besides on the far right, not many people think austerity is good. But it is often necessary. Not always, and not always in the amounts it is doled out, but it is clear that doing nothing, as the European left would desire (I'm looking at you, Hollande), isn't going to work.

And, as usual, I will get downvoted for saying this, because most people in /r/Europe think in terms of black-and-white, and anyone who argues slightly in favour of austerity is obviously a Tea Party loon.",0,1377110581,null,0,1377115243,0,cbsfzqf,t3_1kt449,t1_cbsfzqf,t1_cbsdyqk,null,1429749478,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,JimmyNic,ENGL,England,"&gt; I think you’re missing boq’s point that, for more and more Europeans especially of the younger generations, the language barrier already is gone. Europeans communicate to each other in English. It often isn’t a very sophisticated version of English, but it is English nonetheless and it allows a proximity that in that past was inconceivable.

That is probably true, but it doesn't compete with the linguistic union that has existed for hundreds of years. It might be possible for a fluent English speaking German to understand things about English and American culture, but it remains difficult for a monolingual Englishman to reciprocate. That problem does not exist in Anglo-American relations. 

&gt; Honestly, it’s one-directional for Anglophones as well: the US consumes its own culture and very little of anybody else’s. The obvious exception would of course be things like Harry Potter or Downton Abbey, i.e. works that became huge hits internationally – so that doesn’t speak to any particular US-UK closeness.

Yet international hits such as Harry Potter are impossible without the common language, and there are numerous British actors and musicians just as well known in the states. The communication is lopsided rather than one directional.

&gt; That’s… just a historical issue. The US was born as a British colony. British people moved to the US as settlers long before the later tides of immigrants from places like Germany or Italy, killed the native population and established themselves as the founders of the USA. That doesn’t mean that in the intervening 200+ years the two countries haven’t diverged considerably.

It's very generous of you to write my argument for me. [Also.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Rapprochement)

&gt; Honestly, I’m a Greek/English binational in a relationship with a Canadian and, despite the fact that arguably Canada is way closer to Europe than the US, yes, there are considerable differences that set us apart in ways which simply cannot be compared to the relationship between Europeans of different nationalities – I would argue even the North/South divide that people make such a big deal of is irrelevant in comparison with the trans-Atlantic cultural clash.

I can't speak to your experience, but it runs counter to mine.

&gt; Agreed. But that isn’t a reflection of actual, real-life differences, but just a divide that exists in the head of prejudiced jingoists which has been fuelled by an irresponsible press and populist politicians. Nationalism has passed the dinner test in the UK, becoming part of Europe feels like losing power and being subsumed by a greater entity, while desperately clutching to the US’s coat tails fuels our self-importance by allowing us to vicariously rule the world like the huge international power that once was. But none of this means we’re closer to Americans than we are to Europeans – it just means we’re really deluded.

The political divergence is as much influenced by the continental anxiety regarding the USSR as the British Imperial legacy. The major failing of your argument is that it fails to acknowledge the traditional conservative hostility towards the US (precisely because the American Empire succeeded the British one) and the Leftist hatred of the US for its imperialistic behaviour. Between those the desire to hang on American coattails is only to be found amongst the political classes. That said, I don't happen to think a desire to self-govern is an entirely unhealthy reason to oppose European Integration, and it's childish to label it as prejudiced jingoism.",0,1377112353,null,0,false,0,cbsgq6x,t3_1kq34n,t1_cbsgq6x,t1_cbseng5,null,1429749135,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3

Occupying 1/3 of the world's territory at one point, and not to mention the slavery that the British were so kind to implement. We only have to look at the state of Africa to how the British manage to rape lands.

I also had the 'pleasure' of studying Russian history through the British Schooling system. I also have family who come from the USSR and who actually lived through the times of the regime, not to mention a wealth of family friends, all through whom I have heard talk of the Soviet Union at one point in time.

Communism is a wonderful ideology and it is a shame that greed from the 'West' has tainted the name of communism, not to mention the awful ruling of the Soviet Union. However all I have to do is point you towards Cuba to show you a country that gets along fine without committing evils.

Bulgaria was an ally to the Soviet Union. I guess a similar case would be if a British monument in America was defaced or Visa Versa. I do not agree with war, or killing. I do not believe that soldiers are heroes. However I also feel many soldiers just do it because of the propaganda bestowed upon them and feel they are 'defending' their country. Being told it is a noble way to die. 

Every soldier ever has probably felt that what they were doing was right, and whilst every soldier is responsible for the murders they commit, we must respect the dead. Therefore I would never disrespect any memorial to any soldier, not even a Nazi memorial, because who knows, in the same conditions, I myself could have been one of those soldiers.

As for how bad the Soviet Union was. I do not understand what you are talking about? Stalin was a nutcase, but I am still very thankful towards him. Had it not been for the Soviet Union or Stalin, we would all be speaking German at this point in time, I would be a slave because Hitlers ideology believed 'Slavic' people should be so, and Jews, Blacks amongst other ethnicitys, would be extinct. You might not like the methods Stalin employed, but you owe the Soviet Union and Stalin gratitude for potential saving the world from Domination from the Nazi forces, certainly Europe would have fallen had it not been for the USSR.

What linguistic union? You lost me. 

&gt; Yet international hits such as Harry Potter are impossible without the common language

That’s clearly not true, as the international hit Harry Potter, that has been translated into over 60 languages, demonstrates. Again, not following your argument. 

&gt; there are numerous British actors and musicians just as well known in the states. The communication is lopsided rather than one directional.

There are also numerous French actors and musicians well known in the States. This proves nothing.  

&gt; That said, I don't happen to think a desire to self-govern is an entirely unhealthy reason to oppose European Integration, and it's childish to label it as prejudiced jingoism.

Almost as childish as distorting somebody else’s argument so shamelessly. The discussion wasn’t about European integration and I wasn’t labelling the desire to self-govern prejudiced jingoism. I was arguing that the prevalent anti-EU feeling in the UK is not driven by logical arguments at current. There are indeed a lot of really intelligent discussions that can be had about the EU’s democratic deficit and the need to respect the national sovereignty of the Member States - discussions which we should be having. But these are nowhere to be found among the anti-EU British nationalists at present.

true,Thyrotoxic,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Communism is a wonderful ideology and it is a shame that greed from the 'West' has tainted the name of communism, not to mention the awful ruling of the Soviet Union. However all I have to do is point you towards Cuba to show you a country that gets along fine without committing evils.

I actually happen to agree with you, it'd be perfect, if it ever worked. But what realistically happens is people are persecuted for having different beliefs, it's happened in every communist state including Cuba, and that is just wrong. The West hasn't tainted communism human nature and greed has. 

&gt;As for how bad the Soviet Union was. I do not understand what you are talking about? Stalin was a nutcase, but I am still very thankful towards him. Had it not been for the Soviet Union or Stalin, we would all be speaking German at this point in time, I would be a slave because Hitlers ideology believed 'Slavic' people should be so, and Jews, Blacks amongst other ethnicitys, would be extinct. You might not like the methods Stalin employed, but you owe the Soviet Union and Stalin gratitude for potential saving the world from Domination from the Nazi forces, certainly Europe would have fallen had it not been for the USSR. 

If there was a more sane person in control the war would have ended far sooner and there would have been far less deaths. Stalin was one of the main reasons the red army faired so poorly in 41 and 42. He purged large parts of the officer corps because of his own paranoia.

Alot of those industires were closed down due to being part of a completely failed economic and social system.

Also, the antiquated products and capital pretty much ensured that they'd close the day Ceausescu got a lead shower.

questo dl sul femminicidio, composto da 12 articoli, non fa altro che riprendere altre leggi in tema di stalking, bulilsmo e violenza aggiungendo delle aggravanti e aumentando le pene nel caso le vittime siano donne, e in più ci infila un articolo, il decimo per l'esattezza, che si intitola **Norme in materia di concorso delle Forze armate nel controllo del territorio e per la realizzazione del corridoio Torino-Lione, nonché in materia di istituti di pena militari** e in pratica trasforma i cantieri della TAV e zone limitrofe in val di susa in zone strategiche/militari, equiparando le proteste più estreme (taglio delle reti o blocco delle vie di accesso) ad atti di terrorismo con conseguente aumento delle pene per chi partecipa a queste proteste.

Ora, io non sono certo a favore della violenza sulle donne, però:

1. Leggi che puniscono la violenza su altre persone esistono già ed esistono anche delle aggravanti per motivi futili (come la gelosia o altri che sono comunemente associati al femminicidio) quindi, a mio parere, aumentare le pene di default solo perchè la vittima è una donna mi sembra un comportamento sessista esattamente quanto la cultura che si cerca di debellare con questa legge.

2. infilare una leggina che riguarda nello specifico i cantieri torino-lione (tra l'altro una legge che riguarda un cantiere specifico mi sembra non sia proprio costituzionale, le leggi dovrebbero riguardare dei comportamenti in generale e essere applicate di volta in volta alle situazioni specifiche) in un decreto contro la violenza sulle donne mi fa sospettare che più che proteggere le donne con questo decreto si volesse far passare proprio questa singolo provvedimento che sarebbe stato difficile far approvare in separata sede, essendo la questione abbstanza controversa, quindi è stato infilato in una provvedimento più ampio che nessuno avrebbe contestato, a meno di volersi suicidare politicamente.

If you have 10 people with 100€ and 1 person with 3000€, the median is 100€, while the average is 363€.

Just curious, do you have direct knowledge about this? Because I was doing internships in such ""state of the art"" factories back then, and in a field where you need to retool every 2 years to stay afloat, those 'hi-tech' factories were about 10 years outdated.

&gt;For instance, oil. The national oil company has reserves worth probably 20-30 billion € and it the majority of shares were sold for € 750 million. Now it has yearly profit of 1 billion €.

It has that profit exactly because it was recapitalized through privatization. Extracting oil, especially in the late stages of the life of the oil field, is extremely capital intensive.

&gt;That's simply not true. See data from Eurostat. 

I don't have better sources momentarily, but it's not how I remember it.

true,anarchisto,ROMA,Romania,"&gt;  This said once the catch up is done corruption and backwards education and social systems do become a problem, this was the case for Romania as well.

Sorry, but I feel some unwarranted smugness. What ""backwards education and social system""? 

The Romanian education system worked quite well, it produced a generation of intellectuals and engineers that was similar in skills to what the universities in the west had.

&gt; Alot of those industires were closed down due to being part of a completely failed economic and social system.

The produce of those factories was definitely inferior, but that doesn't mean that the people who designed them were worse engineers than those in the West, it's simply that they had to deal with lack of technology, shortages of materials and ideological Party directives. 

Let me give you an example: copper shortage -- Romania had limited copper reserves and it had to import it for hard currency. the Party made mandatory that all factories to reduce copper usage, so their engineers were forced to create a product using an inferior metal (aluminium) instead of copper. It was stupid that sometimes the costs of this would be higher than the actual cost of copper.

This is a leadership failure, but it doesn't mean that the whole factories were useless.

&gt; the interconnectedness of the massive warsaw-pact command industries meant that if one country did fall the others would follow suit

Actually, you are slightly wrong about this. Romania tried to ""liberate"" itself from the Warsaw Pact and this is why it tried to export to South America, Africa, Asia and even the capitalist west. In some more sensitive areas (such as computers), it had to import technology from the Soviet Union and friendly European countries like France, since the US had an embargo, but overall, Romania got its technology from the West.",0,1377118457,null,0,false,0,cbsjbqm,t3_1kt449,t1_cbsjbqm,t1_cbsi5gk,null,1429747924,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Sorry I don't agree with you there. The USSR was the first state to eliminate religion and replace it with universal atheism. What's more the USSR was a very very diverse country. If you mean beliefs by political beliefs, then yes persecution was high, but by no means more than the Americans employed towards communists in their country at the same time.

'The West' has contributed greatly to the tainting of the image of communism. To this day, politicians in America call each other communist as a derogatory word, and 'The West' are the ones who have promoted Capitalism and it's greedy values. I do not want to get too much into the philosophy of greed and human feelings, because opinion differs greatly on this subject matter, but I personally believe greed is not a 'natural' human emotion.

I was taught in school that Britain was on the verge of collapse during the battle of Britain, and that had Hitler not changed his efforts and switched fronts, Britain would have succumbed. Now I had no reason to question this as it was taught at a British school, but I am now very interested in reading more into this, and will research the Battle of Britain thoroughly. 

I am not by any means calling Stalin a great leader, and sure it is possible there were plenty of better people who could have run the country better. But they didn't. There could have been better leaders than Churchill at the time, who would have saved more British lives, and would have been better than Churchill. Does that make Churchill's achievements any less valuable? No. Stalin was mad, and he wasn't even Lenin's chosen succesor, in fact I believe Stalin messed up our chances of a greater humanity because he used communism for his own gain (also maybe because of his passion for death and because he was such a cunt). But I guess it's like being saved from a murderer by someone who was upstairs raping your wife. The rapist is a slimy piece of work, but at least your alive to be able to criticise them and in a fucked up way, you owe them some gratitude.

Sure you should be able to criticise the USSR. We should be able to speak freely about everything and comment on what we like, and although we currently do not have freedom of speech, hopefully we are striving towards a society where freedom of speech is accepted as a staple of society.

true,Thyrotoxic,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;I was taught in school that Britain was on the verge of collapse during the battle of Britain, and that had Hitler not changed his efforts and switched fronts, Britain would have succumbed. Now I had no reason to question this as it was taught at a British school, but I am now very interested in reading more into this, and will research the Battle of Britain thoroughly. 

I'll start with this. Let's say that the Luftwaffe and managed to gain air superiority (not supremacy big difference) over Southern England, their fighters did not have the range to fly to Northern England, their bombers would not have been able to get much further North without fighter escort and would have easily been destroyed by the RAF operating from Northern bases outside of the range of German aircraft.

The Germans did not have any landing craft, their plans for Operation Sealion consisted of using converted river barges to cross the channel. Assuming they landed and established a successful beachhead even with an intact port they could not have shipped sufficient supplies over the channel and unloaded them. Now those are ideal conditions, realistically a landing is incredibly difficult and any port would be blocked and destroyed if it was threatened.

The Germans may have pushed North but there were numerous STOP lines in their way, they did not have the air power like they did in France and their biggest problems was the Royal Navy. The Navy would be dispatched from Scapa Flow and arrive within a few days were they would cut the German supply lines.

The Germans did not have the naval power or logistics to continue and operation overseas and it's almost certain that had Britain been invaded the Americans would have joined the war, and they had a massive industrial base and could massively outproduce Germany. One of the main reasons the Soviets won and Britain was more than a mere annoyance is because of American lend-lease and materials. In fact 90 per cent of trucks used in Soviet logistics during the war were American made. This is not discounting the Soviets, who as you rightly said, won the war, just it was a joint effort between the three allies. 

Right on to the ideological debate. 

&gt;Sorry I don't agree with you there. The USSR was the first state to eliminate religion and replace it with universal atheism. What's more the USSR was a very very diverse country. If you mean beliefs by political beliefs, then yes persecution was high, but by no means more than the Americans employed towards communists in their country at the same time.

Yes I mean political beliefs, the Americans at least, did not ship people off to die in gulags and they had at least some semblance of a justice system and not a system of kangaroo courts. 

Stalin was murderer and his political decisions almost destroyed the Soviet Union, he was an absolute maniac. But yes he did not represent the Soviet Union after the 50s. Still there was a huge amount of persecution and random arrests and life in the puppet states, particularly East Germany was terrible, the Statsi in particular were terrible. 

And we all come back to the statue, I'd almost forgot what this debate was all about. I still stand by my viewpoint, this is statue that for the locals is a memorial for foreign soldiers who occupied their lands for 45 years. Yes it was political, yes millions gave their lives for the freedom of Europe, but people will still remember the political persecution and brutal crackdowns of the Soviets. I do understand your point though and I can certainly see why people would be annoyed.

Two, in Western Ukraine (where my family are from and the deaths were the worst), there were people conspiring with the Nazi's.

The show takes place in an unnamed Dalmatian village during the late interwar period, through World War II, and into the immediate post-war period. The show chronicles the lives of several people in the village. These also seem to all be on Youtube, so [here] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlck5oUv86M) are the first seven episodes.

This show was produced in Serbia and takes place mostly in Belgrade, but it was made in Yugoslavia so... I'm posting it anyway. [Grlom u jagode] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grlom_u_jagode) which translates directly as '[with] throat into strawberries [fields?]. It's a phrase that means doing something without thinking it through first. The original series consisted of 10 ~45-minute episodes, each chronicling a year between 1960 and 1969 centering around the main character and his group of friends but with some references to historical events of the time (often as the episodes closed). It seems that the full episodes are all on Youtube, here's the [first] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5cg93UW24c) one.

More stuff:

* I'm not sure whether I've mentioned that the villages in Aracena are really beautiful.
* Near the capital there are the Río Tinto mines. A Mars-like landscape featuring a train that takes you around the area.
* This may sound dumb, but it is useful to know when going to the beach: the water is FREEZING. It's the goddamn Atlantic, after all. If you go when the sun is beginning to set the climate will still be mild enough, and the water will have considerably warmed up.
* That hour is also most convenient because the beach is still very nice but much less crowded. In places like Cruce de la Redondela I recommend you to go on weekdays if you can, because on weekends you'll find it difficult to find a good spot, since the locals take the chance to enjoy their own beaches while free from work.
* https://es-es.facebook.com/bichitoluz Not leaving the village much during the summers, I must have been sitting at this place for dozens of nights already :D
* In my village there's every summer this rock festival, but I guess you won't be around to go: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ZQdSqH8VM&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
* Apparently there's also an Argentinian restaurant there, too: http://www.huelvamap.com/place/el-gaucho-argentino/
* Many of the villages and towns, including mine, can be seen with Street View on Google Maps. So check before you visit. My village for example is quite unimpressing, it is the surrounding area that's interesting.
* Huelva is quite touristy, but they come looking for the beach, so you hopefully won't have to mingle with those pesky Brits. Joking, the Brits there are older and more well-mannered as those in Mallorca and the like :)
* You should look into itineraries concerning Aracena, El Andévalo, Río Tinto and the Ruta Colombina.
* Unfortunately there aren't many guides concerning Huelva exclusively, so you're stuck with general Andalusia guides. I found a couple that look interesting ([this](http://libros.fnac.es/a698960/Huelva-Guiarama) and [this one](http://libros.fnac.es/a123524/Huelva-Guia-azul)). I'm sure that you will be able to purchase some useful guides once you get there. Your Spanish will come in handy for that :)
* Don't mean to sound nosy, but I -ahem- looked through your other messages and found out you study Spanish literature. I can't believe I forgot about Moguer, the birthplace of Juan Ramón Jiménez. You need to go there, really. I know everyone's familiar with ""Platero y yo"", but one of my professors (I'm finishing up my translation studies) was always going on about a prose poem called ""Espacio"", which I love. The guy was kind of a jerk to his wife, who was also a talented writer, but hey, he chose his words well.
* One of the best video guides on Huelva you'll be able to find is [this one](http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/un-pais-para-comerselo/pais-para-comerselo-huelva-strawberry-fields-poquito-jamon/1690990/), and free of charge at that. It's part of a program in which two well-known Spanish actors from ""Cuéntame"" travel around the country looking for food, culture, as well as landscape. You'l also get a chance to check how the Huelva accent sounds (*ceceo* is prevalent there). By watching I was reminded of gambas, but they're so duh that you were bound to find them and eat them some time xD But seriously, these are the best ones you'll taste.
* If you like stand-up comedy, go to the [Mandala](http://www.mandalahuelva.com/?page_id=621). Spanish stand-up artists are among the best and if they're any good you'll find them on YouTube and check them before you go see them live.
* I left out Islantilla on purpose in my first message because it's the kind of tourist-trap you should avoid (I go there a lot when I'm staying in the area because they've got the nearest cinema and Burger King), but the seaside promenade is very nice to walk along day or night, when it's not crowded.



Trivia stuff:

* In Lepe every woman's name is Bella, in La Redondela it's Esperanza, in Isla Cristina it's usually Carmen. Blame the Holy Mary iteration in worship at each of those villages.

* Apparently, pretty much the entirety of Ayamonte is haunted by ghosts. Looks like an alright place to me :D Don't worry, I've been there dozens of times and not once noticed anything weird...
* [Chistes de Lepe](http://www.1000chistes.com/chistes-de-lepe)

* You're bound to meet [this kind of people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6k5qbt72Os) while in Huelva. This one's obviously a parody, but the clothes and lyrics are spot on. They're the Spanish version of British chavs. They started out in Seville and spread all over the country.

* Guerra Civil stuff: when the Francoist troops arrived in the area they went around putting people in front the firing squad. Women were forced to drink caster oil and their heads were shaved. A relative was an air force pilot and died in the war. My grandfather had to join Francoist troops, even if he didn't want to, and (I don't know if this is a tale, I never knew him and my mother is not so sure about this) planted the Francoist Spanish flag in Madrid when it fell. Various relatives were mistreated. I know a neighbour from my village used to thank a friend of my family each time he saw her, because Francoist soldiers asked her if he had seen him but she lied to them rather than telling on him. He would have been shot and she saved his life. I know of a man who escaped to Portugal dressed as a woman.

Sadly, Huelva is still a quite unknown area of Spain, thus the lack of travel guides and information on the Internet and even ground mediums of transportation u.u

Mind you, Huelva is also a quite rednecky farming/fishing area, owing to the neglect of governments during past decades. Generally I've found that older people are nicer, more rational, and villages are just villages in every part of the world. By that I mean that I was a bit bullied some or other summer in the village but the region is also the place where I've met some of the funniest, most laid-back people.

I can't really help you with cultural stuff such as concerts or similar events, or the new exhibitions, etc. but these two sites can:
- http://www.huelvainformacion.es/ - The region's main newspaper in its online form

Huelva is no bustling city in the cultural aspect, but I'm sure you'll always find something to do.

You should also get around a bit and check Granada and Cordova.

Since you're staying for so long, I would also visit the other main Spanish cities, especially Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Bilbao. They're amazing. Other places I love are Gijón, Oviedo, and Santander. Galicia too. I'm digressing again.

You also better take the opportunity to enjoy the nice weather while you still can in beaches and places where warmth and sunlight are required, and move on to indoor recreation (museums and the like, or outdoor places that don't require you dipping your feet in the sea :D) when it gets too cold outside.

With that in mind, if I were you one of the first things i'd do is actually taking a trip to the Algarve. I can provide you with tips on that too, as a made a short trip there from Ayamonte and all the way to Lagos a couple of years ago.

Last but not least, here's an excerpt from ""Espacio"" by Juan Ramón Jiménez:

“Los dioses no tuvieron más sustancia que la que tengo yo. Yo tengo, como ellos, la sustancia de lo vivido y de todo lo porvivir. No soy presente sólo, sino fuga raudal de cabo a fin. Y lo que veo, a un lado y otro, en esta fuga (rosas, restos de alas, sombra y luz) es sólo mío, recuerdo y ansia míos, presentimiento, olvido. ¿Quién sabe más que yo, quién, qué hombre o qué dios, puede, ha podido, podrá decirme a mí qué es mi vida y mi muerte, qué no es? Si hay quien lo sabe, yo lo sé más que ese, y si quien lo ignora, más que ese lo ignoro. Lucha entre este ignorar y este saber es mi vida, su vida, y es la vida”.",0,1377120227,null,0,1377120928,0,cbsk2ap,t3_1kll02,t1_cbsk2ap,t1_cbs8brd,null,1429747579,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1

You can freely walk around Oktoberfest without ticket, enjoying the atmo, eating snacks and do all sorts of fun stuff :) If you want to enter a tent though you'll have to come early because the tents close when they're full, but again, no entrance fee! I'd recommend going really early if you want to make sure to find a place in a tent, perhaps at 12 already (but im not quite sure since i've not been there for the last two years because i was abroad) when you come later you'll need some luck to get in! You can make reservations and even rent a ""box"" which is a sealed off area only for you guys but that is REALLY expensive! Tip: If you aren't an ""expirienced"" drinker try a ""radler"" which is half beer half lemonade, it tastes great and isn't that strong, the Oktoberfestbeer is a bit stronger than regular beer and i'd guess you don't want to be shitfaced after three beers, because you can only buy ""Mass"" beer which is one liter ;)

If EU structural funding is increased specifically for Greece then one important question is:  
Can Greece absorb it timely and effectively enough for it to be helpful?

I think most historians put Soviet deaths, civilian and military to at least 20,000,000. The Holocaust is remembered because it happened in the ""modern age"" and was a real attempt at wiping out an entire ethnic group, it was extremely efficient and industrialised and the percentage of Jews that were wiped out was huge. 

I do know about McCarthyism, the West was not without its faults and its anti-communist and leftwing actions were terrible for so called free states. Still nobody was sentenced to die in a prison in Alaska, thousands were not murdered. The West did tend to be a little more inconspicuous with its takeovers, carefully orchestrated coups were how the US worked, less deaths but there was essentially US puppet states in South America and I doubt they will forgive the Americans for a long time. I am not defending the West but they are not responsible for the same persecution as the Soviet Union. 

After 1989 there were massive anti-communist protests in Bulgaria though, the people did want democracy and the same political freedoms as afforded in the West, it was not exactly popular.

Sure people had to endure hard labour in the middle of a snowy desert, but I for one am in favour of hard labour punishment rather than the system of privatised prisons we have in the modern day. As an idea, it's great. If your a criminal, and you've had a negative impact on society then off you go to do some free labour to work off your debts to society. Of course this system relies on a just justice system, but I would say it is impossible to compare what system was more unjust. 

The American or Soviet, both were corrupt (the soviets over ideology, and the yanks over money). It is impossible to tell which was more corrupt. And as you say, the American's are more sneaky in their approach and use intelligence as a powerful tool. I don't put anything past the Americans when it comes to protests and uprisings.

It's a shame we were never able to see Lenin's vision of Communism, and don't believe everything you read in the books. From what my parents tell me the USSR had a great social system, with education placed at the pinnacle of society. You could become whatever you wanted. However society was plagued by the constant spying on citizens by the KGB and the fact luxuries such as electornic goods wern't freely available. I think at the end of it all, personal greed and the want of small luxuries triumphed over the ultimate goal of a society for everyone (not to mention some retarded laws imposed by the government).

Let's look at Russia now. Corruption is at the same level, if not higher. People are still spied on by the FSB (to a lesser extent albeit). Gays are persecuted and intolerance of other cultures is rising. Education standards have slipped massively, drug intake is at an all time high, along with STD's. Child abuse is high, along with prostitution. And why? All for the chance to eat at a McFuckingDonalds.

Of course this system relies on a just justice system, but I would say it is impossible to compare what system was more unjust.

Bref. I disagree but you have my vote nevertheless.

Your first point is clear: we need to change something to get the economy growing again. The situation is especially dire given our demographic situation. Everybody agrees with that, the question is how.

The problem with austerity is that it focuses on cutting costs to balance government deficit but does very little to actually change the system.
If we can do the same with less money, cutting costs is painless and probably uncontested.
The reality is that cutting costs will diminish services rendered to the public.
What's worse, is that in practically all cases the savings are immediately pushed to individuals who are pushed to the free market to buy the same services.
Privatization is an example where, despite some successful cases, individuals have had to pay the difference.
Schooling would be another.
You say ""we"" offer no alternatives. I would like to content that there is zero evidence that austerity works as advertised.

I think the fundamental problem with austerity is that the costs are placed disproportionally on individuals.
In stead companies have to be taxed more and directly, because indirect taxation of their employees discourages hiring.
Trickery with accounting has to be attacked at the expense of flexibility.
Consumers have to be protected aggressively (no contracts nobody understands) again, at the expense of flexibility.
As always, there are the threatening stories: the companies will all go to the cayman islands.
I content they will only do that if we let them.
If they want to do business in Europe they pay the price like everybody else.

Beyond balancing the budget there are a myriad of problems to be solved.
Cutting red tape is a good start, but I also think we still have not solved the financial crisis.
Anyway, some european reforms I think should help:

* Banks should be cut to pieces and consumer banking should be separated from investment banking.
* Strict EU banking regulation under a single authority.
* Bad debts in Greece etc. should largely (~ 50%) be written off, i.e. bankrupcy, and fallout (failing banks elsewhere) should be dealt with locally.
* Special european anti-corruption units and court with supranational authority to attack misuse of european funds (I think this will also set an example and clean up the worst excesses).
* Coordinated taxation for companies (doesn't have to be equalized) to enable countries to set their own rates, i.e., close loopholes.
* Expand anti-collusion research at european level.

Otherwise most issues will have to be dealt with locally. I think problems are quite different in many places. I would expect borrowing costs to remain very high for a number of countries but not crippling. Important is to send a message that, yes, banks can fail, and yes you will loose money if they do.
It remains to be seen if Greece (et al) will reform effectively, but at least they won't be able to run in the same debt trap so easily if banks are controlled more tightly.",0,1377127635,null,0,false,0,cbsmtc2,t3_1kt449,t1_cbsmtc2,t1_cbsfzqf,null,1429746260,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

You can find some muslims who for some reason oppose stunning for example by claiming that the stunning kills the animal, or that the stunning itself causes more suffering to the animal especially in case of electricity. 

But the fact is that 'not stunned' is not a requirement for halal, and in Denmark and Finland muslims butcher stunned animals just as the local animal welfare laws require.

There were hundreds of political prisoners executed in Czechoslovakia under the communist regime - and thousands more died in custody.  Hundreds of thousands were arrested and served time in prison for political crimes, and hundreds of thousands were exiled from the country unable to return for fear of persecution.

Czechoslovakia had one of the top industrialized economies and highest standards of living in Europe (and even the World) before WWII.  The successive Soviet military occupations after the war had a deep and profound effect on the country and stunted its economic growth for 45 years, the results of which are still felt today, 20 years later.

The country was undeniably repressed by Soviet occupations and influence over Czechoslovak politics.  It was *nothing* like having US bases in Western Europe.

&gt; For most of the people, life didn't change that much after they left. The main change for me was that we no longer called teachers ""comrade teacher"".

You should be ashamed saying things like this.  You have no idea how many people sacrificed their lives standing up to the communist and Soviet oppression.  Just because your family apparently had a good life under communism does not mean other innocent victims of the regime have not suffered - believe me, for them and their families, life changed massively after the Soviet army left.",0,1377134500,null,0,false,0,cbsp6pa,t3_1ksd45,t1_cbsp6pa,t1_cbscpcv,null,1429745120,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

* Het Klokhuis: Essentially our Die Sendung mit der Maus. Everything explained to children, in a non-childish manner. Entertaining for adults too. It was part of the evening block for children, which also included Sesame Street and the Jeugdjournaal (news for children - also watched by many adults)

* Keek op de Week: Satire and sketch comedy. The two presenters would discuss recent events and act in skits. They coined many new words and terms (stoned as a shrimp, ""regelneef"") and were quite influential for a TV program in NL. A recurring act was the Tegenpartij [Party Against], whose slogan was ""Together for ourselves"" and consisted of two clearly criminal individuals. They actually created a political party and might've even gotten seats in parliament if they hadn't disbanded right before the elections!

* Ook Dat Nog*: Consumer protection tv series are (of course ;) ) wildly popular here. As an alternative to serious programs like Kassa and Radar, Ook Dat Nog acted out conversations between customers and whoever wronged them - to much hilarity. It became so popular that they only had to mention the name of the show to fix someone's problems. Ironically, one of its presenters died because her faith healer told her not to get cancer treatment.
