1. Copyright protection was prescribed by law (i.e. there was a legislative backing)

2. It must be for one or more legitimate aims. (It was held that the aim in this instance was legitimate as it protected the Article 1 of the 1st Protocol's right to ownership) 

3. It must be necessary in a democratic society. (It was held that the aim made it necessary, the punishment was proportionate and there was no pressing social need for the material)

It means that in some circumstances copyright law may not trump freedom of expression but it seems to leave a very limited scope.

true,clemenstimpler,GERM,Germany,"This is difficult to answer correctly. I've googled around and I've found the hypothesis that in Germany early 19th century elites forged silently a compromise: the liberal bourgeoisie helps to stabilize the state, if conservatice bureaucrats organise access to public office based on merit rather than feudal criteria. 'Merit', however, is a relative category: If your father was a physician, the probability is quite high that you will become a doctor, too. If academic degrees are an important part of the 'symbolic capital' of your family, you tend to cherish them. In other words, such elites seem to be self-reproducing. Two data points on that:

1. The overwhelming number of politicians austed in Germany because of plagiarism belong to the conservative-liberal spectrum. Leftists in Germany are much more suspicious of academic merits. Think of our former foreign minister, Joseph ""Joschka"" Fischer, who never would have had any chance of a career in the 80s green party as an academic (nowadays he's a guest professor in Princeton, or so I've heard).

2. In Germany, medical and law degrees are organised by the state rather than the universities. In the US, you need both a law degree and a bar exam in order to practice law. In Germany, both steps are organised by the state.

true,chemcat392,null,null,"Considering other aspects:

In Barcelona there are A LOT of motorcycles and we (myself included) usually drive fast and between cars. So, if you are going to drive around Barcelona you' re going to be surrounded by us. It can be kinda crazy, actually. In Spain, most of the cars are the stick shift type but there are also automatics. If you want to rent a car and you want it to be automatic, you should probably ask for that specifically. Anyways, it's not that hard to drive a stick shift car :)

You should know, also, that in Barcelona (in Catalonia, basically, the region where Bcn is in Spain) we speak two languages: catalan and spanish. It can be overwhelming at the beginning if you can't speak either language. Spaniards are not known for their good English after all... I'd recommend you to take a course in one or both of them.

There's really good food here :D In Catalonia we always eat ""pa amb tomàquet / pan con tomate"" (bread with tomato). It's everywhere; sandwiches you buy in a bakery will probably have tomato unless you ask otherwise. The tomatoes are not sliced but ""spread"" over the bread :) We also use olive oil to cook, it's not as much expensive as it is in the US or several other European countries. There's also potato omelette, and some other stuff you'll find out about soon enough.

The Mercadona supermarkets are cheap and they are everywhere, once you're here walk around the neighborhood and you'll probably find one. Avoid ""Opencor"" unless it's an emergency, they are reeaaally expensive but they are open 24/7. Most of the stores are closed on Sunday so get everthing you might need before that

Now that Valentine's Day is around the corner you should know that is not such a big deal here. In Catalonia we have ""Sant Jordi"" (Saint George Day) on April 23rd. On that day women give a book to men and men give a rose to women, but not necessarily has to be their boy/girlfriend or husband/wife. It can also be between father and daugher, mother to son, etc. You will see Barcelona and any other catalan city covered up with roses. A very beautiful day.

In Spain your (american) football is not very popular, most of us are soccer supporters. In Barcelona there are two teams: FC Barcelona (aka Barça) and RCD Espanyol. The most important one is Barça with blue and red t-shirts and Espanyol players wear a blue and white t-shirt. Barça supporters are called ""culers"" and Espanyol supporters ""pericos"" (a type of bird). There are also basketball teams, Formula 1, etc.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/17h786/should_the_european_union_continue_as_a_monetary/c85qtgs) is a comment I wrote and I was describing how a French farmer gets more/cow, raised in the exaxt same way, solely based on the number of *trees* where the cow grazes. As you can understand, the number of trees where you graze have absolutely no impact as long as the cow get grass, roam freely etc. 

So, it is a arbitrary thing, that has nothing to do with the quality of the life of the cow/the milk they produce or something, but it is also something that is very hard for Sweden (Finland too, Estonia etc) to change, since we have *a lot* of trees. We can not change that.

I mean that it is discriminating, our cows don't have a worse life, at least not based on the number of trees. Yet, a Swedish farmer gets less. Why? 

Here is also a link to another lengthy post I made to another person who also wanted sources, and perhaps a bit more facts, just like you. 

Ignore the beginning, where I discuss the cow/tree stuff again, but then I list thinks that are wrong, with some links. I link to a (British) report, that describe how arbitrary the subsidies are. Page 13- 18,is where they list the negative stuff, with graphs and sources of course, and also proper links. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/17xe1f/frances_hollande_warns_against_endless_austerity/c8af5kv). It is an easy read.


In there you'll also find a post to a BBC article, that sort of lists, and explains a bit of the issues. 


I might also add, that there are other things I find wrong with the CAP, apart from the ""geographically inequal distribution""/discrimination. 

For example, not to fond of the two pillar system, do not like the fact that 44 % of the  EU budget goes to something that is 2-3 % of our population work with, do not like how we treat thirld world farmers, do not like the fact that it raises prices for consumers, do not like the fact how they rich/aristocracy get the most of the payments, although the little guy needs it the more [Here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/28/utilities-aristocrats-eu-agricultural-policy) is an article about that in Britain, but I know it is the same in Sweden, and I am sure in France too. On the top of my head, I think 0,2 % of the landowners got 24 % of the money from the SPS (Single Payments). 

So, either we fix this, or, which is becoming more and more my suggestion, we remove the CAP - all together. Each for their own. Then all countries can subsidies their own farmers to their hearts content if they want, and you will not hear a peep from me. Also, obviously a country is not unfair/discriminating to itself, so then that issue is solved too.

According to the table on [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Sweden) page, Sweden's fertility rate was below the replacement rate in 42 of the last 44 years. The consequences of that can be seen on page 456 of [this](http://europa.eu/epc/pdf/economic_and_budgetary_projections_for_the_27_eu_member_states__en.pdf) EU report (pdf). They estimate that  the percent of Sweden's population that's 65 or older will grow from 18.3% in 2010 to 23.5% in 2035. Meanwhile the prime age (25-64) population percentage will shrink from 39.1% to 36.1%. That ratio of only about 1.5 workers for every retiree will likely put pressure on all sorts of government programs (like healthcare), not just pension funds.

If it weren't for predicted immigration to Sweden, along with the immigration of the last few decades^*, the demographic forecasts would look a lot worse. Especially since immigrants tend to have more children than native Scandinavians.

I slightly agree with what you are saying there, but the fact remains that they haven't been making much progress in fulfilling the various 'chapters'. I do, however, suspect that if the Cyprus situation was fully resolved, countries such as France will continue to stop them from joining anyway.

I personally am of the opinion that Turkey's EU candidate status should be suspended until both sides can take the concept of Turkey becoming a member more seriously (because: yeah, while I am sure the EU isn't very welcoming of Turkey right now, Turkey hasn't exactly been trying either). That said, I do support the concept of Turkey being an EU member state when they are ready. I just do not think it will be for quite a few more years.

Of course, if you're in Germany, Berlin is a very nice place to be but I don't know if Berlin justifies missing out on Austrian culture and west German culture. I'd actually suggest to make a round trip. Berlin, Dresden, Munich, Vienna, Cologne (because cathedral and 297525 kinds of beer), Düsseldorf (because 297525 kinds of completely different beer and nice city as well. Not as much covered with cement plates as Cologne), some cities like Bochum where you can see some old coal mines which was quite interesting and then Hamburg because the north is completely different than the other parts of Germany.

Then straight to Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris. 

He also could go to Hamburg first and then to Amsterdam and then the west German cities. It takes you an hour from Cologne to Bochum with 2 trains and you can change in Düsseldorf. If he doesn't like the west, he can just get into another city. And then there is the Thalys (I hope that's how you spell it) which is a direct train connection from Cologne to Paris. I think it's Cologne -&gt; Düsseldorf -&gt; Brussels -&gt; something else in Belgium -&gt; Paris (north station) so if he has the weird foreign train ticket, that might even be the cheapest way to get to Paris (Düsseldorf -&gt; Paris is just under 4 hours. Took that train several times). I think there is also a second Thalys from somewhere in the south which means he could leave west Germany alone and maybe keep it as an option for later.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"&gt; Your position would seem to be that Turkey should entirely abandon its position, the Turkish military should withdraw without any agreement on general demilitarization, and that the ethnic Turkish population should agree to be ruled by the Republic of Cyprus. Do you really consider that to be a reasonable solution?

My position is a little bit more complex that that. I am of the opinion that there is no such thing as a Greek Cypriot and a Turkish Cypriot and that both Greece and Turkey should stay out of it. Greece has more or less understood that Cyprus is a separate country now, but Turkey hasn't. *Cypriots* should be ruled by the Republic of *Cyprus*. The whole thing gets a little more complex when you consider that Turkey has been importing actual Turks to the northern occupied part. In the ""southern"" part? You can actually tell who is a Cypriot and who is an immigrant from Greece within moments. I would go as far as saying that ""Turkish Cypriots"" (and I do not mean 'Turks that live in Cyprus') have more in common with ""Greek Cypriots"" than they do with Turks, and the same applies the other way around.

Seems to me that the whole '*Turkish Republic* of Northern Cyprus' experiment Turkey is working on has more to do with making sure something is Turkish more than anything else -- seriously, not just a Republic.. a *Turkish Republic*!! That alone should give you an idea of how messed up their view is.. I don't exactly see it being called the *Hellenic Republic of Cyprus* on the other side of the story. Then if you want to argue about sides, the ""Southern part"" has at least 3 times more population than the ""Northern Part"", you remove the settlers out of that population and suddenly it starts looking more likely that Turkey used a small minority of Turkish speaking Cypriots to justify annexing another country's land.

A lot of actual ""Turkish Cypriots"" have since gotten their Republic of Cyprus passport (as they are entitled -- so yes you could say that they are ruled by the republic of cyprus internationally.. seems funny that they would rather have the cypriot passport rather than the turkish one, no?) and moved to other countries such as the UK. The amount of Brits on Cyprus right now likely rival actual Turkish Cypriots still here.

tl;dr: Cyprus for Cypriots.

That seems pretty dubious logic. The smaller the size of the ethnic Turkish population, the greater the risk within a government run by a Greek military junta (as it was).

I don't disagree when you say that Greece and Turkey both have to disengage, and it probably is the case that Turkey now is exploiting the situation for geopolitical purposes. 

That's why a credible route towards Turkish accession is vital, because otherwise there will never be a solution. The balance of power between Turkey and Greece will only shift towards Turkey in future. Either Turkey is brought into the fold or Cyprus will remain partitioned.

If you allow something like the Cyprus situation to become a precedent, it'd be on par with Turkey invading and occupying a third of the Southern UK or Eastern Germany to protect a couple of million Turks after some BNP hooligan or neo-nazi minorities go on some kind of rampage on Turkish immigrants for not integrating or something like that. Except in such a scenario, you can say ""let them try"" -- Cyprus didn't have that capability. Trying to find a logic in which a partitioned Cyprus is something that can be worked on would be on par with saying ""Oh well, at least we can get a good kebab in Turkish London now"". If such a scenario wouldn't be acceptable to you, why is the Cyprus situation any different -- because it's a small/insignificant country? Aren't all countries small/insignificant when compared to someone bigger? Isn't this why the EU was formed initially?

I definitely agree that Turkey's accession can be vital towards finding a solution, but how about they show goodwill by fixing the situation rather than doing it for a ""fee""? Just saying, it'd be nicer to let them become a member because they deserve it instead of ""it was part of the deal to stop occupying land belonging to another member"". All I've really been hearing from Turkey is along the lines of ""The EU should follow OUR rules and do what WE want, because we are correct and they are wrong!"". Seems like a bad idea to me unless we want another veto-crazy country in the EU.

This is exactly why I think it's time to go harder on Turkey regarding their accession. Actually tell them exactly what reforms they need to make, so they can't keep living in their reality distortion field of ""We're right and everyone else is wrong, because we said so"". If that's too much for them, just suspend their candidate status -- unless our next move is to beg them?

However, if we can agree that being bigger allows you to do whatever the hell you want, then I guess we have the marketing worked out for a Federal EU ;)

tl;dr: Just because Turkey would probably make an excellent trading partner, it doesn't mean we have to bend over and do everything how they want, nor should we ignore them bullying a small country just because it's small.

true,AndNowIKnowWhy,null,null,"hm, lockdownit, you'd be amazed that this urban myth that espresso is stronger than coffee is false. It tastes stronger, but contains less caffeine. It's because of the different styles of preparation: espresso is water pressured through (a big amount of) espresso specific coffee bean powder. The higher the pressure the better the quality. It's the reason why it is so much thicker and more ""creamy"" than pure coffee. 

 But because of the velocity with which the water is ""shot"" through the powder, the water has only short contact with the powder. Since the caffeine takes longer than the aroma to dissolve in the water, you get a rich taste that is relatively less bitter than coffee (if well done).

Compared to that a coffee is much more intense in caffeine, even more so when kept warm over a period.

It seems like a waste of coffee beans but when it comes to good taste, italians wouldn't even flinch to do what it takes. It's a funny contrast that you sometimes get the most terrific dish on a plastic plate or get served an awesome homemade Vino Nero out of plastic cups.

China used to be a partner until 2007, but later China has been concentrating on its own system Compass (Beidou) - don't know the actual reasons for dropping the parthership, though it was one of the reasons for US threats to shoot down Galileo satellites ([US Could Shoot Down Euro GPS Satellites If Used By China In Wartime: Report](http://www.spacedaily.com/news/milspace-04zc.html)).

Galileo will provide many services which exceed current GPS and EGNOS (European system to augment GPS):

* Free access navigation with 1m accuracy even on high latitudes

* Encrypted commercially accessible precision navigation to cm accuracy

* Encrypted government accessible precision navigation (PRS)

* Guaranteed precision with integrity warning messages (Safety-of-Life applications)

* Global search and rescue operation with feedback to the user

Even though private investement has not been what was originally planned, those services will be valuable and provide for many valuable applications on long term. Though arguable if they are worth the high price tag of the system and its running costs.

&gt; The United States also initially opposed Galileo, with officials in the administration of President George W. Bush worrying that the European system would interfere with GPS channels used by the military and could be used by America’s foes in a war.

AFAIK US opposition started during Bush era after 9/11 and war on terrorism. Galileo's PRS channels were to be on the same spectrum as US was planning their new military M-code signals to be. And their actual worry was that on a time of crisis US could not jam Galileo PRS without pontentially interfering its own GPS military channels too. The dispute has been settled and Galileo's PRS channels were moved to different spectrum. Now Galileo's PRS and GPS M-channels are possible to jam independently without interfering other.

One of the first things you should do is get your NIE, which is your identification number. Once you have one of these, life will become a lot easier for you - you can't even join a gym or go to a yoga class (or sign up for bicing) without one. 

A lot of good info has already been posted, but take it all with a grain of salt. Lidl is cheaper than Mercadona but you won't find the same products. There are so many amazing markets that sell meats, cheeses and produce that you will hopefully take advantage of. The food here in general is great but it's not always easy to tell apart which restaurant is a tourist trap and which is authentic! 

One of the comments said that Barcelona is rushed and I have to wholeheartedly disagree. Get used to things taking long, stores being closed at hours you would expect them to be open and people generally being quite leisurely with their time.

There are free Catalan lessons that you can take advantage of - the locals will appreciate it and you will immediately feel more comfortable. Great place to meet people too. 

I would stick around til at least June, because that's when things really get going, with all the festivals and all but if you are going to be travelling around a lot, vueling is the Spanish discount airline and is far more reasonable with their baggage allowances etc than some of the other airlines!!

I would say that 99% of arvanties did not mix and I truly believe that, but I would not be shocked if a few hundred of the war heroes of greek independence did marry a greek girl . . . If these men fought in the greek independence war than to me they are 100% greek and any greek would feel the same.

But 99% did not fight in the wars and most albanians exist in there own communities till this day.

I have explained before but I will try again . . . My next door neighboor and many others in my town are Albanian. Greeks do not talk/interact with them, they are taught this since being young. The albanians have there own albanian communities/friends etc with other albanians . . . that is how it has been for hundreds of years.

A common insult/slur in my country is calling someone albanian, if I want to insult my friend I'll scream at him ""come on you albanian!"" . . . does this make you understand how greeks/albanians get along in greece?

The greek/albanian relationship is more like how black people were treated in the 40's in USA but with much more rights . . . we do not treat albanians badly! we treat them with respect and humans but we do not mix/interact with them.

This sounds 100% racist but it is just how it is over there, greece is a very very old school place.

Now as far as the arvanites . . they are considered ""better"" albanians . . they are still albanian though and still SPEAK albanian and still love there albanian heritage . . . a modern greek girl/boy who is brought up since the day she is born to not be friends/talk with an albanian will not breed with one . . it just does not happen.

I know of one girl from my town who was in a relationship with a bulgarian and it was a big scandal and she was harrassed . . . she will not be able to marry this bulgarian and still live in her hometown because she would not be wanted . . . if she wants to marry this bulgarian she will have to move to bulgaria .  . I have never heard of someone dating an albanian . . That would be like hearing someone is dating a lepor, it just does not happen EVER.

Do you really believe that 2-5 million greeks who descended from the City-state greece were outbreed by a few hundred albanians?

You FYROM;ian people are OBSESSED with thinking that greece was somehow wiped out by these ""arvanites"" . . . it is simple psychology actually . . it is called PROJECTING, google it. You are ashamed of what you see in yourself so you PROJECT it to other people/countries. . .

This isn't entirely correct. Székelys of the mountains tend to the define themselves as one of the Hungarian-speaking peoples (""magyar ajkú népek""), but ethnically distinct from Hungarians who live say in Oradea/Nagyvárad. 

Historically half-confirmed legend says that Székelys are the descendants of Avars who lived around Győr and Vienna, so basically the descendants of Attila's Huns, who at the Hungarian conquest were resettled to the southeast, to Transsylvania to serve as  border guards and later on adopted the language. 

Historically they were usually seen as a free peasants  who serve the king through military a service and not pay taxes like a serf. This is the probable cause why they developed a fiercely proud, independent spirit. Resembles the whole ""Don't tread on me!"" culture of certain parts of the US.

The relationship between Székelys and the Hungarians around for example Oradea/Nagyvárad is not 100% ideal.

Why did it come to this is a complex question with many different answers:
- voting system that gives parties almost total control over candidates that can be elected. Although voters circle their candidates in voting booth, votes in reality go to the party that nominated them. Another point: if you like the party, but not their candidate in your area, you are really in difficult position with no exit. 
- Political parties do not need parliamentarians that can think for themselves/endanger party leadership. They need someone who can follow orders &amp; push the right buttons; no other skills necessary. Total negative selection.
- Public image of politics in general is very bad. Political career offers incredible opportunities for destroying personal reputation forever. Why bother, then?
- Financial compensation. Although above average, not nearly in the same ballpark as at other high position jobs (with much less public scrutiny).

You're making a jump from Huns to Avars pretty quickly. I'm not saying it's true or false, but being Avar does not necessarily mean you are descended from Huns.

&gt;The relationship between Székelys and the Hungarians around for example Oradea/Nagyvárad is not 100% ideal. Székelys often think Transsylvanian Hungarians compromise too easily with the Romanian state, don't have a firm enough backbone, especially in Oradea/Nagyvárad.

So much so that in the Commie times, Szekelys tended to go to different University cities then the ""proper"" Hungarians. Some Szekelys prefered to go to college in Bucharest, rather then Cluj, the main Hungarian city in Transylvania.

A lot of non-szekely Hungarians were urban dwellers and looked down on the Szekelys as hillbilies, while Szekelys considered Hungarians as arigant assholes.

And yes, Szekelys do tend to be more uncompromising, but whether it's because of a backbone, or a thick skull, it depends on which side you ask. :)",0,1360244514,null,0,false,0,c8ay3su,t3_18244k,t1_c8ay3su,t1_c8axz86,null,1431219286,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt;Europe “is like someone who buys a car but has no money for petrol,” Diego Canga Fano, a senior European Commission official in the department responsible for industry, said at a space conference in Brussels last week, referring to uncertainty over money for the Copernicus project. “The car is useless. We are a bit in this situation.”

It gets better:

&gt;Galileo has had such a troubled history that many doubted it would ever get off the ground. Critics mocked it as “the Common Agricultural Policy in the sky,” a reference to Europe’s program of subsidies for farmers, which eats up nearly 40 percent of the union’s total budget.        

&gt;A 2011 report to the European Parliament listed a catalog of troubles, noting that Galileo had been particularly blighted in its early years by a familiar problem: political pressure from individual countries to skew the project in favor of their own companies and other immediate interests.        

&gt;It also ran aground, the report said, on friction between the “pro-Atlanticist” stand of strong American allies like Britain and the “pro-European” outlook of nations that often have strained relations with Washington, like France. “Political disagreements among member states marked the Galileo program since its very beginning,” the report said.        

&gt;A cable from the United States Embassy in Berlin released by WikiLeaks reported private remarks made in 2009 by the chief executive of a German satellite maker, OHB-System. It quoted the OHB chief, Berry Smutny, describing Galileo as doomed to fail without major changes and “a waste of E.U. taxpayers’ money championed by French interests.” Mr. Smutny, who disputed the comments attributed to him, was fired by the company.      

Bureaucracy at its finest. 


&gt;The United States also initially opposed Galileo, with officials in the administration of President George W. Bush worrying that the European system would interfere with GPS channels used by the military and could be used by America’s foes in a war. Washington also asked why, when many European nations were increasingly unable to fulfill their military obligations as members of NATO because of defense cuts, they wanted to splash billions on a project that replicated an existing system paid for by the United States.        

&gt;After long and sometimes testy negotiations, Europe and Washington called a truce in the dispute, and now each pledges to cooperate to make the two systems work together.        

&gt;Officials at the European Commission now stress that Galileo is not meant as a rival to the American system but as a European-controlled extension of a shared global navigation network. They acknowledge that Galileo, most of whose services will be free like those of GPS, will not earn much. Airlines, shipping companies and some other commercial users will probably be asked to pay for certain data.      

It sounds like this was a project that was conceived with lofty goals in mind, and has now lost its focus, and sense of purpose. I obviously don't know much about this issue, but it looks like it has devolved into primarily a prestige project. A very expensive one at that.

True, Galileo is and will be expensive. 

Of ESA's 4284 M€ budged navigation takes 16.6% (709 M€), which is more than launchers or scientific programme, [see breakdown here](http://www.esa.int/For_Media/Latest_web_news/Budget_as_presented_during_DG_press_conference_24_January_2013). But I'm glad that Earth observation is still the biggest part with its 22.9% (983 M€).

The Greek Cypriots rejected it precisely because archaic treaties designed by a political body that doesn't exist any more should not stop them from being a nation.

Turkey basically backed a deal they knew would be rejected.

The sensible way forward is a unified Cyprus with its own sovereignty. The barrier to that is Turkey who insists that there is no deal that doesn't keep Turkish sovereignty (albeit joint) over the islands.

Look at the current situation. The UK is never going to assert its position as a guarantor of independence. Greece is too poor to do anything. The Turks basically want a deal that conveniently leaves them in charge of the whole island.

As it is I think the whole situation is best resolved by restarting Turkish accession talks and finding a way for them in. On the condition that they agree to proper sovereignty for a unified Cyprus rather than a tripartite guarantor system.

The only alternative that could work but is completely unthinkable would be for the UK to assert its role as guarantor of independence. Hell Turkey might even agree to it if it keeps Greece out.

true,HansAdler,null,null,"The German Wine Route isn't quite on the path from Frankfurt to Munich, but it's close enough. It's on the eastern edge of Germany's biggest continuous forest, the Palatinate Forest. This area exported plenty of people to the US: Pennsylvania Dutch is based on this region's local dialect. And it's at the western edge of the Rhine valley, though that is very wide here and not as picturesque as the famous Rhine and Mosel valley sections further north. Still, lots of castles. If you take that route, consider dinner at the ""Dürkheimer Fass"" (a restaurant in a huge wine barrel) and a visit to the ruins of Hardenburg castle and Limburg monastery nearby. Lots of excellent white wine is produced here, especially Riesling. The local wine is dry, but not quite as dry as that in other parts of Germany: This is just about the warmest region.

If you have time to go further south in the west before turning east to Munich, go to Strasbourg. It's in France, but the capital of the historically German speaking Alsace region and now one of two seats of the European Parliament. Maybe even go to Freiburg im Breisgau as well, the 'capital' of the Black Forest, and take the train up through the Black Forest through beautiful scenery. But these options may reduce your time in Bavaria, which is also great.

Berlin is great of course and you might find once you are there you want to stay as long as possible. Still, consider a day in the nearby Spreewald, where Germany's Slavic speaking national minority (the Sorbs) use boats as their main means of transport through the forest and grow cucumbers.

On your way westwards, an insider tip is Königslutter. Its 12th century abbey houses the grave of Emperor Lothair III (1075-1137). The very sleepy town itself has a lot of old houses that are just waiting to be restored and together to create a major tourist attraction. One day. Or maybe they will rot first. The current poor condition is due to the town's unfortunate location close to the inner German border. 50 km to the south there is Wernigerode in the Harz mountains, an old mining area. This used to be *the* tourist destination in Germany as the first reasonable mountains when you came from the north. Goethe spent a lot of time there. Very unusual: 7 train services a day (less in the winter) from Wernigerode to the Brocken, all operated by steam engines. This is only possible because East Germany constructed steam engines as late as the 1970s due to the oil crisis. There are several of them under steam in Wernigerode's station, day and night.

Further towards the Netherlands, the Ruhr area is a huge conglomeration consisting of many large industrial cities. It had a lot of mining until recently. Very interesting dynamics nowadays, and nothing a ''typical'' tourist would want to see. But this, like Berlin, could be a good place for experiencing normal German life.

A bit further south, consider visiting the marvelous city of Luxembourg in the little country of the same name, between Belgium, France and Germany. National languages in this monarchy are French, German and a German dialect. Should be great for Prisoner-of-Zenda-style nostalgia.

1. They are causing trouble with multiple countries at the same time. Israel/Greece/Syria/Iran.They have all but declared war on Assad and the Shias, and so many things can go wrong because of this decision by Turkey to support the FSA rebels. It is not unimaginable that if Assad falls, Iran will seek revenge by supplying the Kurds in Turkey with billions of $ worth of weapons using Hezbollah as the proxy delivery man.The kurds right now are in the process of intense militirization and it is very possible that a war could brew inside Turkey between the turks and a now very very well armed kurdish terrorists forces.

2. They are taking the steps towards becoming an islamic leader of the middle east instead of being the secular force of the middle east, this wll only cause democracy and freedom to be destroyed inside Turkey.

3. The Turkish economy is going ok but will completely  crash if the Kurds decide to launch widescale terrorists attacks, also not being reliant on oil is not a good thing .. there is a reason why Turkey was trying to bully Israel/Greece about the natural gas fields by Cyprus(and failed at bullying).

Oh man. There's so much to ESA that I really can't convey it in a single post, they do so much cutting egde work and top notch research (ever heard of ESO? they're cool too). Just for some notable examples Hubble is a joint NASA&amp;ESA project, and so is Cassini-Huygens (with other agencies).

If you're interested start here: www.esa.int

&gt; I was unaware that Canada contributed anything into the ESA.

Canada is an associate member of ESA since 1979. CSA's contribution is very much appreciated and is beneficial for both its space industry and ESA.

From [relevant wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Space_Agency):
&gt; Despite that the provisions in the ESA Convention do not show restrictions that only European states can join,[1] the ESA Council implements such rule de facto and that is why Canada has only the status of associate member.[3] However, it is as tightly integrated with the ESA institutions as possible for a non-member state.

Australia used to be an associate member but decided to continue only in [European Launcher Development Organisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Launcher_Development_Organisation).

ESA's future enlargement plan includes Turkey, Ukraine and Israel, which aspire for a membership.

&gt; I was also curious as to what ""human spaceflight"" represented since the ESA lacks the ability to put people into space on its own. I assume that is money allocated to paying the Russians for rides into space?

**1.ISS**

International Space Station is a joint project between NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA.

ESA has contributed about 8% of ISS budged, and produced segments Columbus Lab, Harmony, Tranquility, the Cupola, and will provide the European Robotic Arm to the station. 

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson_in_Cupola_ISS.jpg/800px-Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson_in_Cupola_ISS.jpg

ESA developed the spacecraft ATV for resupplying the station and is providing resupply launches (Jules Verne, Johannes Kepler, Edouardo Amaldi, Albert Einstein, Georges Lemaître).

ESA has astronaut training programme and provides astronauts to ISS. Launch service is bought from Roscosmos (Baikonur). There has been some plans to develop ESA's own human launch capabilities, but it would be costly (I don't support).


**2.Future co-operation with NASA (and other agencies)**

ESA is in partnership with NASA to develop future manned spaceflight beyond cis-lunar space. Just for one example ESA will [develop the service module for NASA's Orion spacecraft](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Research/ESA_workhorse_to_power_NASA_s_Orion_spacecraft).

Future manned flights beyond cis-lunar space (Moon, asteroids, elusive Mars) are planned in co-operation with NASA, ESA, JAXA and other space agencies.


Anyway. I'm not that big of a fan of human space flight. I wish they allocated that money to science. ",0,1360255875,null,0,1360257739,0,c8b13t5,t3_181zje,t1_c8b13t5,t1_c8aznix,null,1431220714,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I don't even know where to being but that's *not* how constitutions work. The constitution is not a Wikipedia page everyone can edit to their hearts' content. If it were and it all came down to there being a sufficiently large number of people that want to change x or y then there would be no hungarians in Romania simply because there's a humongous number of people who are beyond sick and tired of their shit and would promptly descend into Trasilvania with halberds of the sharpest steel and cleave them in half and then hurl their bodies across the Romanian/Hungarian border with trebuchets, not catapults, trebuchets. Fortunately for them, the constitution cannot just *be changed* to account for whatever desires group x or minority y may have, that's primitive tribalism and has no place in the 21st century. 

Oh and, can any historian punch him the face for this one?

The fact that copyright on works derived from common culture now far exceeds the lifetime of the people living in said culture is the problem because it deprives those people of their own culture.

Some context:

Before this law, getting citizenship was next to impossible unless you could prove a blood relationship with someone who already had it. The law allowed children born to immigrant parents legally living in Greece for at least five years to be granted Greek citizenship provided they had studied at a Greek school for a minimum of six years. 

All conservative elements of Greek society opposed the law, most notably the current PM Samaras who listed rolling back the law as one of his major pre-election promises. 

The court ruled that each applicant must be examined individually to ensure they have a ""genuine bond"" with Greece.

true,lk09nni,null,null,"Hey! I am currently living in Paris as a Swedish expat on approximately the same budget. Here's my 5 cents:

1: Flatshare. Even though having a small studio for yourself is awsome, you will have so much more fun in Paris if you don't throw all of your money into a dreadfully expensive flat. Living costs are what will probably eat up all of your budget. Finding nice flatshares is easier when you are on site and can meet the people there in person. I booked a room through Airbnb for the first couple of weeks and took it from there!

2: Make sure your place has a stove so you can do your cooking at home, eating out every day is not a viable option.

3: You can find nice and comparatively cheap cheese, veggies and fruits on the open-air market at Blvd. de la Villette, on wednesdays and saturdays. 

4: Instead of going out to eat in restaurants, go there to drink wine and (if you want to spoil yourself) order a plate of fine cheese to go with it. Drinking wine is comparatively cheap (at least compared to my home country) while drinking beer is shit expensive. 

5: As someone already mentioned, rents are lower and the bars are better in the 18th, 19th, 11th and 10th arrondissements, even though it's nice if you are able to stay as close to the centre of Paris as possible. Some people may scoff and say that this or that arrondisement is dangerous - but I dunno, I there's lots of people out all the time and students, artists, prostitutes and immigrants seem to get along fine in these lively and friendly areas.

6: Although Paris is supposedly a comparatively safe city, there's lots of pickpockets. Keep your wallet close. 

7: If you need a lunch out, baguette-sandwiches are usually real cheap in your local boulangerie!

Good luck! =)

Their fuel efficiency goes up with their gear and it doesn't stop until everyones favorite atmosphere starts resisting their speed too much. Which is at about 90 kmh. Trust me if all the cars that drove through cities drove at 30 kmh the cities would smell WORSE.

congestion: Okay let me tell you the story from my countries capital copenhagen. We pride ourself with some of the highest focus on puplic transport and bycycling. And those areas are reaching saturation too. It is not cars that are filling cities up it is people. The urbanization is reaching its limit and that is happening everywhere. But this will not solve it.

And finally... Cities are NOT for living in where the hell did you get that idea? Cities are for WORKING IN. That is how they were created. Jobs were in the city hence people moved there. Living in cities is a side effect if you will. Now jobs does usually require people to show up on the workplace in reasonable time and that is how our economy rolls. Now i shouldn't need to tell you that this is not the times where you wanna bring in stuff that may significantly hinder our economic growth. Especially when there is no ecologic benefit at all, and other options are avaliable.

What is a single mother living in a city for? Her job of course, it certainly isn't the healthy environment for her children that keeping her there.

The road that you mentioned is what the rest of us have the 30Kmh zones for, the really dense places. The exceptions. But the vast majority of areas in modern cities needs to run at a reasonable pace for our society to run aswell.

Indeed, Wikipedia says the Avar Khaganate is a later migration. 

But this is why I called it half-confirmed legend. The Avar - Székely connection is well-confirmed, the Hun - Avar is less so. 

There is a certain Hun consciousness in the Székely culture, such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Csaba but it seems to be a 19th century creation.

Note that the above Wikipedia article is kind of inaccurate. Huns and Csaba are not really parts of mainland Hungarian mythology. At that time Hungarians were many thousands kilometers away in todays Ukraine. It is more of a part of the Székely mythology - Prince Csaba's Aragorn-style spirit army riding on the Milky Way -  that got kind of mixed with the Hungarian mythology. Although there have been efforts since the 19th century to ""retcon"" Attila, the Huns, even Scythians (szittya) into Hungarian mythology, it is entirely unauthentic.

First question:

1. Throughout the ages, Europe has seen migration from different places.

2. Those people have brought different ideas and ways of life with them.

3. Some ideas have remained, others have faded away.

4. Europe is still Europe. Or at least, it is currently Europe as we understand it.

Second question:

1. The best way to be prepared for an external change is moderated exposure.

2. Evicting the Muslims from Europe would decrease the level of exposure to Islamic culture and ideas.

3. That would leave Europeans unprepared for them.

4. Sooner or later, you are not going to be able to ignore 1+ billion people.

5. If unprepared, that's going to be a harsh reality.

6. If prepared, though exposure, on the most comfortable terms — that is, in our own countries, where we make the laws and have the social and political upper hand — then we're as ready as we could be.

Did any of those groups have an alternate legal system like Sharia and primary loyalty and allegiance to the Muslim global population ummah?

Sharia will either be implemented in France or will not be implemented in France, that's a tautology. The question is which outcome is it going to be.

""Europe is still Europe. Or at least, it is currently Europe as we understand it.""

I asked about the Future.

""If prepared, though exposure, on the most comfortable terms — that is, in our own countries, where we make the laws and have the social and political upper hand — then we're as ready as we could be.""

Not if they manage to become a majority and make it their own country, where they make the laws (actually, they just need to implement Sharia, they don't have to start from scratch) and have the demographics upper hand.

It seems that Europe is not as ready as you think.

""If you're uncomfortable with the basic fact that other people exist who live and think differently from you, none of this is going to be a comfort.""

It does not matter how they think and live their lives as long as they do not dictate how I should think and live my own life; incidentally, Islam is not a non-interventionist ideology.

I just moved here 3 weeks ago without speaking any spanish. Unfortunately you'll have a hard time without speaking spanish/catalan. Exceptions may be restaurants close to the city center, but definitely NOT for bureaucracy:


If you're planning to stay more than 3 months get your NIE (**Número de Identificación de Extranjeros**). You'll need it for basically everything like prepaid mobiles, any type of contract, etc. 

To get it you have to go to the **foreigners office** (C/ Balmes 192). Come EARLY! It opens at 9, be there 10 minutes earlier and you'll save a shitload of time - believe me. I arrived at 9:15 and had to wait 2 hours. You'll get a form and a number (A xxx). As soon as it's your turn, the person in charge will speak enough english to help you fill out the rest of the form/whatever is missing. 

You then get a bill of 10€ you have to pay at a local bank. **WARNING:** Most banks do this transaction only until 11:30 or 12:00. Luckily there are many banks around this area.

When you made the payment, go back to the foreigners office, you'll get another number (B xxx), wait again. As soon as it's your turn, you'll have your NIE within 5 minutes.

Most people here are friendly and open-minded (altough I've heard quite some different stories about the catalan people).


If you want to learn spanish, I found a small language school at a very central place: [version original](http://versionoriginalbcn.com). Small groups/single lessons and the teachers are very motivating and friendly. I had a lot of fun there so far. And it's also good for meeting people.

Enjoy the food and the sun - but watch your stuff! There are A LOT of pocket pickers around. And the most important thing: Chill out! Many things go slower here, which can be annoying but as soon as you adopt you'll get to enjoy this awesome place even more.

Some Catholics profess primary loyalty to the Pope, others don't. It goes the same with Muslims. Some are believers first, citizens second; others are not.

Of course sharia will never be implemented as the primary governing law in France. Perhaps people will do that voluntary civil sharia thing that comes up in some places and seems to get everyone all itchy in the pants, but I think that's a non-issue.

Here are some responses:

&gt; If the central goverment sends the police to change that choice I do consider it oppression.

&gt; Basque here our flag the ikurriña was illegal during francoist times

It's nice that people here want to have a dialogue and discuss where Szekelys come from etc. but it doesn't change the fact that the Romanian side is simply *wrong* on this issue. If local people, may them be Tunguzians or Peruvians, want to fly their own flag in an area where they're a local majority, and the central government oppresses it, then that's oppression, plain and simple.  

Again, the only reason why this issue isn't as widely known as the Catalan one is that:

1. the Szekelys are not rich and connected enough to push this internationally (most people don't even know they exist)
2. it's happenning in Eastern Europe which is a hellhole anyway in the eyes of Western Europe, so no one cares

But it still doesn't change the fact that this is oppression of the will of an ethnic minority, in an EU country.

If you read my answer in that previous discussion, I've already admitted my disdain for the study abroad students. They're here in Paris to have fun and thus take the easiest classes fit for Freshmen. 

Honestly, I can't give an accurate answer for the graduate program because I'm an undergraduate student. However, I am a Glob Comm major and many of the professors are shared between the programs. AUP professors are of excellent caliber, especially within the the Glob Comm department. It is one of the most popular areas of studies for students, and thus AUP is always recruiting the best faculty in the field. Just as much as students want to study in Paris, professors want to work in Paris meaning we also get a well chosen flow of intellectuals.

I'm currently taking a [class with Christy Shields](http://foodculturecomm.org/index.html), one MAGCs (Masters of Arts in Global Communications) professor. She's one of the top food anthropologists and her area of expertise is within French culture so you can't get more appropriate in this context of studying in Paris, the food capital.

If France culture isn't your thing, you can benefit from knowing that the MAGC faculty is so diverse in their backgrounds.

I've also had classes with [Peter Barnet](http://www.aup.edu/graduate/magc/faculty/barnet.htm) (American advertising guru with decades of experience), [Youna Kim](http://www.aup.edu/graduate/magc/faculty/kim.htm) (Korean with a heavy background in women Asian studies), [Matthew Fraser](http://www.aup.edu/graduate/magc/faculty/fraser.htm) (British-Canadian who will soon be giving a talk for Social Media Week Paris), and [Justin McGuinness](http://www.aup.edu/graduate/magc/faculty/mcguinness.htm) (British with an academic background in Arabic and Islamic studies). 

What you get at AUP are intimate class sizes (20:1), active discussions, and an international experience (Paris as your city, as well as classmates from over a hundred countries). Even though the layout of your education is American, the lectures themselves are given from a more worldly viewpoint.

If you have any specific questions about the MAGC program, I will try to help you the best as I can as the Global Communications Representative for the Student Senate.",0,1360277364,null,0,1360277769,0,c8b8kfp,t3_182ij4,t1_c8b8kfp,t1_c8b5t8p,null,1431224330,2,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,2

There are two levels here.

The paralell with Vojvodina breaks down when you consider the fact that Vojvodina is multiethnic, while Szeklerland is pretty much defined monoethnically (aka ""the compact Hungarian area in eastern Transylvania"")

&gt;This is not an issue of separatism, it's an issue with an over-controlling central government micromanaging things

Agreed.

&gt;since it's not an ethnic issue

But it is. The Szekler flag is viewed primarily as an ethnic Hungarian flag. There is no ""Romanian Szekler Land"", it's viewed as a region whose creation is wanted only by the local Hungarians. That's why the discussion turned ethnic very quick.

&gt;Btw. if it's illegal to have non-Romanian flags on public buildings, then why is there an EU flag flying on the Romanian parliament?

IIRC the EU flag is also mentioned in the law as being ""allowed"". On the other hand, I don't know if local flags are mentioned in the law. I wonder if [the flag of Oradea/Nagyvárad](http://i.imgur.com/3Svee.jpg) is legal in front of the town hall.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;Sorry we spent the last six decades prepared to spill considerable amounts of blood and treasure to prevent the Russkies from occupying the rest of your self-righteous continent

You seem to forget that the nature of relationships among great powers underwent a fundamental transformation in the post-war era. Nuclear weapons and economic interdependence have provided a strong deterrent for great powers from warring with each other. There was never a strong enough incentive for the Soviets to invade Western Europe after the UK and France developed their own nuclear capabilities. Related is the common belief held among Americans that NATO kept Europe at peace throughout the Cold War (The American media was vociferously adamant about this when the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize). NATO was as responsible for keeping the peace as the Triple Entente and Triple Alliance were for keeping the peace in their time. Military alliances alone have never been effective keepers of the peace.

&gt;you've summarily squandered your ability to mount any sort of competent military response to anything beyond a tiny operation in a nearby country.

Why should Europeans spent exorbitant sums of money on defense when 1. the US is more than willing and able to do so, and 2. there is no existential threat to Europe since the end of the Cold War? You also disregarded the current French operation in Mali.

&gt; Someone has to provide for your defense, and since Europeans (aside from the British, who retain a spine) have decided that it's not going to be themselves, we have to do it to maintain the balance of power.

Many Europeans would argue that recent British behavior is evidence of their spineless defense policy, in which they eagerly submit to American authority. If anything, France is the strongest American ally that has a spine: they've never been afraid to stand up to us and tell us when we're wrong.

&gt;we have to do it to maintain the balance of power.

Balance of power with what? We've lived in a unipolar world for the past two decades. Only now is China presenting some sort of threat to the global order, yet they're still decades behind the US militarily, and have much more of a stake in the global order and stability than the Soviet Union ever did.

&gt;Yes, there's a lot of waste in US military funding, but the impenetrable shield that it gives us and, more importantly, our allies is worth it. Nobody even bothers attacking anyone who has a military alliance with us because they don't want to be blown to kingdom come.

Except that the major military response of the West in the past decade has been to combat terrorist networks and groups, which are **not** afraid of attacking stronger opponents because they are not states.

The American military does provide a lot of stability for global trade routes, disaster and relief aid, et cetera, but to suggest that we have a supposed burden to bear that requires enormous amounts of money at the expense of other services is naive.",0,1360282415,null,0,false,0,c8ba61a,t3_181zoa,t1_c8ba61a,t1_c8b9ref,null,1431225087,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

The title of the article is patently false. The [actual decision DONALD v FRANCE](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-115979) was no big leap towards the freedom of sharing. In fact, the ECoHR ruled that France was not in violation of Article 10. The fines for copyright infringement were upheld and the Court pretty much left the appreciation of copyright law and its infringement to the discretion of member states. Concerning Article 10, the Court said that it might be applicable in these types of cases (this is the only big step forwards if you want to find something from the case) and thats it. It definitely did not outline any sort of a protection for 'freedom of sharing'. And nothing in the judgment says the convictions in any way violate Article 10 of the ECHR. Furthermore, ECoHR decisions typically tend to be very narrowly interpreted and this one didn't even concern filesharing directly. **At most this opens a window for the possible future admissibility of filesharing related cases** and hints that the issue has become a valid area for more case law regarding freedom of expression. This does not however indicate which side the Court will end up moving towards. They might just as well come up with several judgments that uphold the now standing copyright laws all over Europe.

&gt; Why should Europeans spent exorbitant sums of money on defense when 1. the US is more than willing and able to do so, and 2. there is no existential threat to Europe since the end of the Cold War? 

Well, 1 is kind of a silly argument when Europeans complain about how wrong it is for us to spend large amounts of money. You can't say ""how stupid is it for you to spend all that money on military"" while admitting that you'd be paying the same amount if we weren't doing it for you. As for 2, Europeans were skimping during the Cold War too. NATO strategy in Europe amounted to ""meat shield the Soviet invasion until the Americans could show up."" Nobody thought the Europeans could mount a capable defense on their own, because *they couldn't*. Even when there was an existential threat, Europeans didn't have their shit together.

&gt; Many Europeans would argue that recent British behavior is evidence of their spineless defense policy, in which they eagerly submit to American authority. 

Yeah, because they, unlike the rest of those smug hypocrites on the Continent (except Poland), are real allies, not whining moochers who enjoy all the benefits of the stability brought to them by the American military while moaning about how uncouth we are and refusing to help when we ask.

&gt; Balance of power with what? We've lived in a unipolar world for the past two decades. Only now is China presenting some sort of threat to the global order, yet they're still decades behind the US militarily, and have much more of a stake in the global order and stability than the Soviet Union ever did.

Vacuums are dangerous and unstable. America *could* pull its troops out of Europe and ignore Europe entirely, and things might be okay, but they might also turn ugly, fast. We don't know, but leaving geopolitical vacuums is almost always a stupid idea.

&gt; Except that the major military response of the West in the past decade has been to combat terrorist networks and groups, which are not afraid of attacking stronger opponents because they are not states.

Maybe they're less afraid than states of attacking us, but it's simply wrong to say that our policy of blowing terrorist leaders and followers to oblivion hasn't dissuaded a good many people from following in their footsteps. Nobody is under any illusions about what the response from the United States will be to any attack: we will find you, we will kill you, and we will not give up before we do.

&gt; The American military does provide a lot of stability for global trade routes, disaster and relief aid, et cetera, but to suggest that we have a supposed burden to bear that requires enormous amounts of money at the expense of other services is naive.

We *do* have a burden to bear, and most Americans at some level believe that we do, because we continue to vote for people who say that. We have a burden to bear because we believe ourselves to be burdened with a responsibility to lead the world. Self-imposed burdens are still burdens.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;It was American nukes defending Germany, Norway, Spain, Portugal, etc., not British and French ones. Whether nuclear or conventional, American military might insulated Europe from war on the home front throughout the Cold War.

Britain's nuclear arsenal has always been integrated into NATO, whereas France's has been more independent. Don't forget that NATO wasn't only an alliance between America and European countries, but among European countries themselves as well. Even without America, why didn't the Soviet Union roll through the non-NATO, free market economies of Sweden and Finland? In American absence, Britain and France would not have tolerated a Soviet invasion of West Germany. If you need proof, look at the two world wars. Germany represented a threat to both France and the UK, which finally put an end to their centuries of animosity and war. The same thing could be said of Germany during the Cold War. The Soviets were always afraid of German war-making potential. They continued to see a reunified Germany as a threat. The threat of the Soviet Union has also been attributed to the desire for further European integration. A continent that had been at war with itself for thousands of years was never going to unify in a matter of years.

&gt;Well, 1 is kind of a silly argument when Europeans complain about how wrong it is for us to spend large amounts of money. You can't say ""how stupid is it for you to spend all that money on military"" while admitting that you'd be paying the same amount if we weren't doing it for you. As for 2, Europeans were skimping during the Cold War too. NATO strategy in Europe amounted to ""meat shield the Soviet invasion until the Americans could show up."" Nobody thought the Europeans could mount a capable defense on their own, because they couldn't. Even when there was an existential threat, Europeans didn't have their shit together.

It's a way they twist American logic. Many Americans think they have to be the world's police, whereas many Europeans don't think the world needs that kind of presence to begin with. The US is absolutely insistent that it has to play that role. If you think Europeans were skimping during the Cold War, you must think they're absolute pussies now. The Royal Navy was far bigger during the Cold War (our allied with a spine, as you put it). Europe isn't a unified continent. They can't create an armed forces on the scale that the US can. Germany's population is a quarter that of the US. None of them can compete individually. Many have been advocating for common defense (the French in particular, whom you deride as spineless). Unnecessarily insulting your friends and allies is exactly the kind of sentiment that so many people find arrogant about Americans, and only perpetuates the bad reputation we get.

&gt;Yeah, because they, unlike the rest of those smug hypocrites on the Continent (except Poland), are real allies, not whining moochers who enjoy all the benefits of the stability brought to them by the American military while moaning about how uncouth we are and refusing to help when we ask.

I'm assuming you're taking aim at the European countries that didn't invade Iraq with us. Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Moldova, Albania, Ukraine, Denmark, the Czech Republic, FYROM, Latvia, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Slovakia, Lithuania, Italy, Norway. Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain all had a military presence in Iraq at some point. That basically leaves only France and Germany. The French didn't agree with the invasion because it was not internationally sanctioned. Additionally, the French, who developed their own nuclear arsenal so as not to be dependent on American security, are moochers, in addition to being spineless? And what choice does Germany have? Even seventy years after World War Two, they get shit for any sort of military involvement. (""I told you he was still Nazi."") Don't forget that the only time Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty was invoked was after 9/11. How did our whining, mooching friends and allies show their solidarity with us? By invading Afghanistan and staying for more than a decade.

&gt;Vacuums are dangerous and unstable. America could pull its troops out of Europe and ignore Europe entirely, and things might be okay, but they might also turn ugly, fast. We don't know, but leaving geopolitical vacuums is almost always a stupid idea.

How could they possibly turn ugly? There is no country that could roll through Europe with tanks and planes. Not even the United States. Europe doesn't have great offensive capabilities, but their defensive capabilities are top notch. Besides that, there is no geopolitical vacuum in Europe. The EU is a fairly strong entity in its own right.

&gt;Maybe they're less afraid than states of attacking us, but it's simply wrong to say that our policy of blowing terrorist leaders and followers to oblivion hasn't dissuaded a good many people from following in their footsteps. Nobody is under any illusions about what the response from the United States will be to any attack: we will find you, we will kill you, and we will not give up before we do. There's always a bottom to the barrel of potential terrorists, and that barrel gets shallower and shallower as long as we make it incredibly obvious that attacks on us will a) not be successful, and b) be met with swift and terrible vengeance.

I didn't say our counter-terrorism policy hasn't dissuaded potential terrorists from action. We seem to be in agreement on this issue.

&gt;We do have a burden to bear, and most Americans at some level believe that we do, because we continue to vote for people who say that. We have a burden to bear because we believe ourselves to be burdened with a responsibility to lead the world. Self-imposed burdens are still burdens.

I can agree with this. Wouldn't the best solution be to realize that there is no burden to bear, instead of getting Europe to share and perpetuate this nonexistent burden?

&gt;Oh no, I most definitely mentioned that:

I'll give you that it's nearby, but there aren't really any troubling areas in the world outside of North Africa and the Middle East - conveniently located nearby Europe. So far it the operation in Mali seems to have been appropriately sized. The days are long gone where France can subjugate a large country indefinitely. Even American policy has shifted from being able to fight two wars, to fighting one and being able to deter another. The relative power of the West is continuing to decline. The French have certainly learned to pick and choose their battles more wisely than the US or Britain.

Bei meiner Gastfamilie, we spoke to each other entriely in German the whole time I was there. They all spoke basic English, but we never had to use English, since my German was genügend for the more everyday topics/situations with them.

When out and about in public, like in a bookstore or museum, I would always speak German and most of the time the other person would speak German in return (I assume my accent wasn't toooo bad on first hearing), and if they spoke English (usually a younger person) then I would respond to them in German, and they would get the hint that I could speak German well enough. My language school would do weekly social gatherings at a bar, and I remember a younger guy from München was there and we ended up talking for about an hour about various random things for over an hour, and looking back it was pretty funny, since he only spoke English in order to practice it, and I only German, and we never had any problems haha. He seemed to really like me and complimented my German, saying ""Honestly, I don't like most Americans that come here, but you really raise the flag for Americans to me!""...I told him he must have meant ""raise the bar"". :-p

I like to joke with my German friends that Denglisch is now my native language, since I love to mix up the two languages.

Edit: Good lord, this post was longer than I planned haha.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;So self-satisfied, I can smell the smugness all the way here.

Oh, you really, really, like how you debate with facts. Personal attacks is always the way to go, if you have nothing else. If you want to critizise Sweden, apart from the obligatory Abba/Eurovision reference, you can always go for how we integrate immigrants. If you want to critisize me - well I am left - handed, maybe you can start the insults from there if you want to be rude? I am sure someone as good at typing as you can come up with something. Oh, and of course - don't forget Godwin's law! A



I would also like for you to explain to me why what I wrote about the Eurozone being a imperfect union is wrong? . Are you saying that the Euro is perfect? That having a currency union without financial union is good? That the mobility is huge? 

Instead of just mindlessly attacking, I'd *really, really* like for you to explain to me why the Euro is a perfect (or at least a very, very good union) and which one of my points were wrong.


Oh, about Greece, I agree with him on that. Not because I hate Greece (I think they happen to be stuck between a rock and a hard place) but because I happen to think they have a better chance of recovery. But, he was apparently wrong. I think he (and I) can survive that. If you want everything he has ever said to be right, you will be disappointed Could you give me a politician who is ? Also, you know that the fact that they are still in the Euro, has come at an *enormous* cost to above all the Greeks, but also, to other European tax payers, who have now taken over the (former) Greek debt to private banks and institutions. I (and Mr Borg) happen to think that is wrong, that a lot more should be paid, not by the Greeks (they should get more debt reduction) but also by the instituions/banks themselves. As little as possible should be transferred to the tax payers. That is not the case, are you aware of that? Do you think the way this has been handled is good? 

I'd also like for you to explain what we are doing wrong, financially. Sweden that is. I can say a lot about the EU, later on if you like. 

Yes, and why should we join a banking union? Can you show me the treaty where we signed up for that? So, now we are stupid because we don't mindlessly sign up for things at the wink of a hand? 

I can tell you *why* there is talk about a banking union now. It is, because just as I said before, the Euro is a very imperfect currency union, and they are in deep trouble. I mean, the whole Euro have to bee re-done, if one want a currency union, and then I agree, a banking union should be on the agenda, if and when that happens. 

However, they are not redoing the whole Euro now. They are just patching, and not fixing the root of the problem, at all. What more, Sweden, treaty or no treaty, have never signed up for covering other countries bank problems - that was not in the treaty, at all. Signing up for a banking union, after the EZ just have done some of the worst bank saves of all time, coupled with the fact that they have no idea how much that is going to be covered, not having rules in order, not solving, or even voting about the transfers that will have to take place, but above all, not fixing the root of the problem would not only be stupid, it would be idiotic. The banking union is one of those things that will cost the tax payer more money, not the banks, not the institutions. 

I can't understand why you celebrate more costs to tax payers.

So, go on hating me and Mr Borg, but please look into why things are they way they are and realise we have nothing to do with it. I realise it is always nice to blame someone else, but frankly, it is not very helpful if you truly want the Eurozone to work better.

Not because the Germans are evil, but it is their economy who is the biggest, and the ECB looks at Germany when the interest rate is being decided. 

Of course that is not a problem, if your economy is in tune with Germany's but otherwise.

I think there can be a great value for a country to control their own interest rate, particularely in such an imperfect currency union as the Euro. Can't you see that? 

For example, the low interest rate in the beginning of the Euro wasn't exactly ideal for the countries now deepest in the crises, and that is an understatement. 

Also, what I would be even more alarmed about is the internal devaluation, that Greece/Spain etc have suffered from. If you look at the numbers between 1999-2008, all the GIIPS countries lost their international competiveness measured against Germany (it is measured in unit labour costs) with *between 20-30*.

I lived in northern Germany for a month recently, and never found racism to be a huge problem, but it did come up. The racism in Germany was not usually directed towards Africans or descendants of Africans, but rather towards Slavs, Greeks and Turks. And of those, mostly the latter of the three. 

Unlike the american south though, the racism was never overt nor did it prohibit anybody from doing any sort of activity. It seemed to be more of a mentality in the vein of how many conservative upper-middle class White Americans view Mexicans. (They are taking our jobs!/Dirty bums) I'm not condoning what exists, but it seemed like  racism was much less of a problem or something that usually didn't cross the minds of many Germans unless soccer or the economy was brought up in conversation. In addition, as it is in America, there will be a few whackjobs who think that racial mixing/ allowing mixed races to live together is the downfall of western society and that we'll all be damned to repent for allowing (insert race here) to leech off of our successes, but I never saw any of that, only heard about it.

I honestly can't see that. Then Eurostat is totally wrong, and I am sorry, I do not believe that. It might be so in your area, but as a whole, that has not happened. I found [these numbers]( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Comparative_price_levels_of_consumer_goods_and_services) from 2011 (2012 are not out yet I assume) and your prices were *down* compared to the EU average, you are now 60/100 when it comes to food, 69/100 when it comes to gas and electricity. In electrical appliances you are the closest to the *average*, 89/100. 

So, either Eurostat is lying or you have the wrong impression. Perhaps you live in a border town or something where it is more expensive, but as a whole, Poland is way cheaper.

That will slowly disappear when you join the Euro. 

True, you will also get higher salaries, but if you are not as competitive as the Germans you will have really high unemployment. That, with higher food prices, is what is happening in a lot of GIIPS countries now. And, since the governments in those countries can't (unlike Poland) use the interest rate, they have to push down the salaries somewhat. So, what they are stuck with in a lot of GIIPS countries is higher prices/lower ability to compete/high unemployment. That is not where one wants to be. 

I am not saying that it would happen to Poland, but I can guarantee the higher prices, and the complete lack of control over your interest rate/budget deficit/monetary politics etc and competing at the same level  as with the Germans.

Natürlich hinken solche Vergleiche (den Du anfingst ;-), aber dieses häufige Bitten um Geduld, Geduld, Geduld erscheint mir immer mehr nur noch als zäh. Gerade in unserer viel schnelllebigeren Medienzeit (PP die Twitterpartei) sollten Aufstiege eher schneller möglich sein. 

Bei der PP muss man anscheinend eher auf Jahrzehnte setzen. Oder schlicht Hoffnung.

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*[Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.
*[Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 
*[Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing
*In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!
*Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

There are a few interesting small cities around Nuremburg you might be interested in:

**Bamberg:**
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)
* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above
* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;hl=de&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18)  as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.bamberg-guide.de/bamberg/bierundbierkultur/kellerbilder/titelfoto-bearbeitet.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.
* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;num=30&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;t=h&amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;radius=15000&amp;t=h&amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.
*Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recomment ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**
*[Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here
*[Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)
*Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

**Regensburg:**
*[View of the City](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Regensburg_Uferpanorama_2_06_2006.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20060619230718)*

*[The Stone Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Bridge_%28Regensburg%29):* Over 800 years old, served as model for other famous old bridges in Dresden, London&amp; Prague, nothing more to say.
The old town centre with the cathedral is very nice, some nice clubs, good for going out. Also Regensburg is the hme of the [House of Thurn und Taxis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis), which is one of the richest houses of Europe and inventors of the modern post system in 16th century.

**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see
*Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live, and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car.
*[Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremburg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle there and live there.
*[Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.
*The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.
*At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.",0,1360308046,null,0,1360358649,0,c8bhdl6,t3_182asr,t1_c8bhdl6,t1_c8azrsq,null,1431228549,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

**Pro: riduzione costi di trasporto.**  
Falso: il TAV da solo non elimina il trasporto su gomma. Una ferrovia capillare ridurrebbe il trasporto su gomma, ma l'abbiamo smantellata negli ultimi 40 anni. Per portare le merci sul TAV bisogna continuare ad usare i camion.  

**Pro: rinnovabilità energetica.**  
Falso: la ferrovia attuale è già elettrificata e sottoutilizzata.  

**Pro: miglioramento trasporto merci.**  
L'argomentazione qui prende di mira la ferrovia attuale: nessuno ha mai detto che non si possano fare lavori di ammodernamento della linea attuale, anzi. Il costo di esercizio di una linea AV sono superiori a quelli di una linea tradizionale, per cui il concetto di investire per spendere meno in futuro non regge. Inoltre il traffico totale attuale (incluso quello su gomma) su quella tratta è inferiore alla capacità della linea attuale.

**Pro: integrazione europea.**  
Il grosso delle merci non viaggia Est&lt;-&gt;Ovest ma Sud&lt;-&gt;Nord: potenziare l'asse Torino-Lione è economicamente poco efficace.  

Insomma il TAV in val Susa è uno spreco di soldi.
