The key point here is ""needs"". As currently defined by marketing and consumerism, no: Europe's industrial capacity isn't ""enough"" today. Remember that most European industry corporations already moved their factories elsewhere. And they are not moving them back for now.

Surely it is still enough to live better than, say, in Somalia. But that is not we are selling to our own people anyway.

This (letting industry disappear from Europe) is one of the main causes of the current ""crisis"", which isn't really a crisis. It's how it's going to be from now on: a decaying Europe and a dominant Asia (+ America? Who knows...).

If you are wondering, the other great cause is the price of energy: oil and gas, mainly. Your country is an oil producer? You are blessed...

If it breaks down during ratification, though, that means that the party that failed to ratify is at fault, since they agreed to something they couldn't, or wouldn't, follow through with.

In your particular case, I suggest you try and call the Standesamt of Neuwied, simply because I could not think of any other place that comes even close to ""Novit"". If they have documents, they can send you a valid copy of the birth certificate. It might cost a small fee (mine was 5 EUR). Good luck!

The UK (and most other developed countries) faced it's peak of social injustice over a hundred years ago when the nobility controlled the factories and workhouses, most of the population couldn't vote and people choked to death in the cities because of the coal smog that descended upon them.

I think that what people don't realise is that people are certainly becoming more apathetic towards the systems in place but only because it has grown to suit them. The manufacturing sector may have disappeared from our shores but the cost of a car, a computer, clothes have kept descending. Maybe the 1980s set the trend towards increasing social inequailty but quality of life has increased still.

What people seem to fail to realise is that technology has controlled their lives since the industrial revolution. The most potent reason for political change now would be the free-flow on information. 20 years ago Bill Clinton could send a cruise missile and covertly deal with whatever problem presented itself. Now when Obama files a drone in Pakistan the people living there can tell the world before the missile hits.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt;One reason for such caution is that the Americans, though they run the biggest electronic eavesdropping operation, are not the only ones to do so. This is what Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France’s domestic intelligence agency, had to say to Le Figaro (French version here):

&gt;""I'm bewildered by such worrying naiveté. You'd think the politicians don't read the reports they're sent—there shouldn't be any surprise...The agencies know perfectly well that every country, even when they cooperate on anti-terrorism, spies on its allies. The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level like we spy on them, because it's in the national interest to defend our businesses. No one is a dupe.""

The tricky part for European heads of state is how to effectively capitalize on the anger of its citizens directed at the US, while maintaining a decent, functional relationship with US intelligence services and the US government itself. I don't think either European governments or the US government is going to reign in their intelligence services any time soon. 

For the US, Mr. Snowden has been an unmitigated disaster. For European governments, he has been a double edged sword. They can channel rage across the Atlantic and play the helpless victim card, but if they push it too far the US might get angry that European leaders are so willingly stoking the flames, but also actively participating in this same game. Why should the US cooperate with intelligence sharing if Europe is hard at work constructing the theme that the US is the great evil, when they do the same thing? I wonder what direction this will go in when/if Europe gets its own Snowden? 

Right now, Europe can sit pretty by casually pretending to be the innocent victim here. But what happens when/if that narrative is shattered? Won't that damage their own credibility as well? Both American and European leaders are walking on a tight rope. They each need to manage this crisis carefully, and so far Europe managed its cards far better than America. However, it seems like Europe is holding a wolf by its ears here. This situation is hardly under control, and could take a turn with a few leaks here or there.

As I understand it, Labour intended to cut half of the ""deficit"" while the conservatives planned to cut the entire ""structural deficit"" which when you work it out means Labour would have had to have done 80% of the cuts the coalition subsequently did. At least according to the Guardian journalist, whom given that papers leanings isn't something he'd have made up.

There were many recent incidents in which Roma were involved. Eventually the myth of evil dark-skinned subhumans stealing blond angels was brought to the surface. The internet jury already charged these people with violating half the penal code. I'm not suggesting that Roma are not involved in shady activities, I'm merely pointing out the simple fact that their living conditions are conducive to the development of specific behavioural patterns. It's a vicious circle and their children can't easily get out of it.

Regarding Maria's case, I was the one that submitted the NGO's appeal. We didn't have much information back then, and the reports said that it could possibly be abducted. What prompted the police to question the people Maria came to know as parents, might be related to racial profiling, but it was not 100% unreasonable to ask for official documentation about the child, given that some red flags were raised about other illegal activities in this camp. Yes, Roma are often targeted for being Roma, and this is appalling. At the same time, nobody gets a get out of jail free card due to being a member of a vulnerable or a minority group. A side note: we still don't know if Maria was previously ""sold"" to another person that ""returned"" her. There are some unverified reports about that, so take them with a grain of salt. We'll know more about it in the future.

So what? Why are you implying that's a bad thing, superpowers come and go, there's always one falling or rising, it used to be Britain, than the USA and USSR, now only the USA is left, with maybe China being next. Why should I care about that?

Again... so fucking what?

&gt;We are forming a single trade area with Canada and USA to abolish trade barriers and give a maximum possible boost to our connected Western economies.

I'm sorry, but if that's why we're doing this than I don't want it. If there is to be a free trade zone than I want it to be because that's best for the people that live in those areas, not because some neoliberal decided that that's best for the ""economies"" by which I mean some megacorp whos CEO would sell their mother for the right price.

&gt;These deals are very hard to reach, because some parts of economies are being hurt unavoidably, when trade barriers are lifted.

And that's a good thing, free trade treaties aren't some no brainer thing. They have huge negative side effects and for MANY people they represent more negatives than positives, if you sign up for one you better make fucking sure you're getting the best deal possible.

We already did one today: traversing La Ramblas. It'd be cool to meet people, if there's a group heading out to a wine bar or for tapas, where there's enough mix of strangers (I'm assuming meetups are that way) of locals and otherwise, that would be ideal: conversation could venture beyond between me and my girl (fun as it is)

No specific questions. But we'll be hitting a couple of the Jazz concerts (thanks to maxgregor) so if there's a group heading out, it'd be cool to meet with then...

true,jm7x,PORT,Portugal,"&gt; The problem is that there's enough to cover the basics for everyone, 
&gt; yet there's a ton of people who have to live without them. 

True. Inequality only worsens the problem. Even there was enough for everyone, there would be too many poor people. At least around here... 

&gt; I don't really buy that explanation. China's export model, for 
&gt; instance, is completely dependent on the West's consumerist model.

This spells big trouble in the not so far future. Just look at the growth of China and of Europe countries this century. Worrying, isn't it?

Exports depend on the buyers having money. Lending the money for the buyer of our products can afford to continue buying from us isn't a good long term strategy... If Europe continues this last decade trend, China is going to hit a wall. Then, I cannot predict what sorts of troubles will arise.

I do hope they find other markets as good as Europe, soon. Really. Oh, and I didn't even mention India, did I?

Oil countries can simply ease the price as needed to at least suck money at current levels; nobody seems to afford to go to an oil-free economy just yet. Or in the near future.

Back to Europe: without industry, I can't where money will come from. Remember, IP, software, entertainment, tourism and other services are all good, but people need to eat and buy real goods. Goods that only agriculture and industry can produce. Without those, Europe won't go far.

Proof is the current state of affairs, which, I repeat, people think it's a temporary crisis. But I'm afraid it's not, it is structural. Look, even Germany is struggling to grow. And we all agree it's the country in best shape here... At least among those without oil, that is.

Please note that I didn't speak about the Euro project. No need to, it isn't the cause of anything I mentioned... Ok, if the ECB starts churning out euros as the USA prints dollars, we might (just might) fool exporters a little longer -- until they realize they're working for useless piles of paper... And you can't eat paper.

I suppose we could sell Portugal to China as a giant holidays resort. Or another small country they might like better, idk. Mmm...

Le colombe (cioè Alfano, Schifani e il resto). Tendenza Ppe: vogliono guadagnare tempo per mettere in piedi una cosa di centro con Udc, scissionisti montiani e chi ci sta. Il problema è che l'approdo è necessariamente postberlusconiano, e a Berlusconi vivo la cosa è proibitiva.

I falchi (cioè Verdini, Brunetta e il resto). Tendenza Salò: vogliono chiuderla lì il prima possibile e capitalizzare quel che resta della carcassa di Berlusconi per assicurarsi almeno un altro giro. 

Berlusconi. Come al solito, ondeggia tra le due posizioni (testa colomba e stomaco falco): in questo momento è particolarmente incazzato con Alfano perché si è permesso di. Inoltre è molto cacato sotto sul versante giudiziario, e questo gli toglie lucidità.

* Svolgimento

Dal punto di vista formale oggi non è successo niente: si è deciso che bisogna convocare un consiglio nazionale per decidere il da farsi (cioè sbaraccare il Pdl e ribaraccare Forza Italia) e che fino ad allora tutto è congelato. E' l'apertura delle ostilità di uno scazzo che culminerà l'8 dicembre (stesso giorno delle primarie del Pd, tiè) con la conta in consiglio nazionale. E' la risposta dei falchi all'operazione delle colombe sulla fiducia: quella volta era venuto fuori che nei gruppi parlamentari Alfano aveva la maggioranza e quegli altri avevano dovuto abbozzare. Stavolta, che si vota nel partito, i falchi vogliono dimostrare che l'apparato sta con loro.

Al di là di questo, il pallino di tutto resta ovviamente Berlusconi. Nessuna delle due parti può imporsi se non lo si ha dalla propria. In questo momento pende per i falchi (""Silvio, quelli mirano a fotterti: tu ricandidati finché sei in tempo e poi vediamo""), ma tanto fra due giorni parla con la famiglia e si convince del discorso delle colombe (""Silvio, quelli ti portano a sbattere: tu stai buono e non creare complicazioni, e vedrai che poi magari qualcosa arriva"").

Adesso succedono due cose: 1) parte una forsennata campagna acquisti sul territorio: interessante perché si tratta in larga parte di gente che non ha mai fatto un congresso in vita propria e il dilettantismo sarà totale 2) parte, in parallelo, l'azione diplomatica per limitare i danni: già che a scissione si è deciso che si deve arrivare, che almeno sia consensuale",0,1382745013,null,0,false,0,cczq2fg,t3_1p79pf,t1_cczq2fg,t1_cczj89k,null,1428982256,20,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,20

- 30 grams cornstarch

- 1 Litre Whole milk

- Optional flavouring, Vanilla, Cinnamon, Orange zest. 

Cut up the chocolate in to cubes,

Take the glass of milk with the cornstarch disolved in it and start adding it to the hot chocolate milk until reaching the desired density, take in to account that it will thicken further when cold,

When fully mixed then add any flavouring you desire, Consider that the amounts of cornstarch, sugar and chocolate should be changed to personal taste, each person has his own mix he likes.

true,undiadeestos,null,null,"If you look around the world, most patriotisms are either revolutionary (American, French, Turkish),imperialistic (British) or a David vs Goliath thing. Modern Spain doesn't come from a revolution, we're too big to fool ourselves into thinking we are David and we've sucked big time at maintaining an empire.

I would say the identity problem, has two sides, one is the (anti)Catalan issue, but the more important one is how most people in the left gave up the idea of Spain and left it to conservatives.

Some might think that what I'm saying might be too politicized or intellectual but just think about what kind of people, among your friends or family, are the ones who don't give a fuck about 'patriotism' and who are the ones that care.

Corruption or lack of democracy isn't the reason of this problem, you've got much shittier countries whose people are proud of them.

During the Civil War, both sides, no matter how radical they were, appealed to patriotism (some of the poems in Viento del pueblo by Miguel Hernández are a great example). 

Francoism succeeded in teaching its idea of Spain: Catholic, Castilian, militaristic, nostalgic of old imperial glory and the Reconquista, but that's not all Spanish history or identity. 

There are lots of episodes in our history that can be used in a different narrative of Spain, like the Comuneros and Germanias revolts. But the left gave up on that. During transition, the left forgot about their flag, their anthem, their symbols, and didn't even try to challenge the 'official' idea of Spain. PSOE and PCE bought into the rojigualda, the monarchy, but it was an awkward thing, almost antinatural. After Carrillo the Communists rejected both things again, but PSOE has always stayed in that awkward limbo. 

Their alternative was to hype any ""autonomical"" difference, like restricting the remembrance of Comuneros to a Castilla y León regional holiday, even though southern cities like Murcia fully joined the revolt.

This has emptied the meaning of Spain and ""hispanidad"", especially in comparison to French patriotism. As, for the original question, I think that nothing is too late, everything can change in history. Group identities are all about 'us vs. them', whoever that 'them' is (Catalonia? Merkel's Germany? Great Britain?)

TL, DR: It's a political thing, more than a regional problem, the left hasn't tried to build a Spanish identity since 1939.",0,1382754691,null,0,false,0,cczsx5s,t3_1p6c05,t1_cczsx5s,t3_1p6c05,null,1428980924,4,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,4

If the US government were not making a good faith effort to monitor the communication of every world leader, it would be absolutely negligent in its defense of the American people. Of course every other country is doing the same. Does anyone honestly thing the Chinese aren't doing their best to tap President Obama's communications?

true,EvolvedBacteria,CROA,Dubrovnik,"They have big advantage when it comes to cost for driving 100 km. Here are some numbers:

Ok, so spec sheet says that lower end model (60 kWh) can travel about 350 Km in one charge. That's about 17 kWh per 100 Km. For the sake of argument lets round it to 20 kWh per 100 km. Electricity price for 1 kWh during night in Croatia is 7 cents, let's round it to 10. So the final price for 100 km is exactly 2 euro. Remember it could be less, I rounded it to bigger number.

Now let's take your average gasoline car. I would say that car of Tesla quality could easily burn 10 liters per 100 Km, but for the sake of argument let's say it's 7 liters per 100 Km. Price of fuel in Croatia is about 1.30 for 1L give or take 10 cents. Simple calculation says that for traveling 100 Km regular car uses about 9 Euros. That's 4.5 times more than Tesla.

Those are some pretty huge differences if you ask me. I would be so happy if I could spend 10 instead of 50 euros on traveling every month. Tesla will eventually make reasonably priced car (Musk said that's their plan) and if it is any good I will also be the first one to buy it. Even if you buy some car that goes for 5 liters per 100 km it's still much more expensive per 100km. Not even to mention driving in city traffic every day where electric cars are unbeatable.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok. In short. I also need to point out that I am for the free market, so I see his rhetoric in that way. English is not my first language so I apologize and I needed to keep certain things shorter than I wanted because I need to leave but still wanted to answer you. In no way do I think that my argument here is better than Brands [it's probably worse since I had to write it fast]. It's just my opinion.

First of all if you listen closely and read his article he doesn't say that much: the rich are bad, the corporations are bad, the politicians are bad, profit is bad. It sounds like the first year at college who just read Marx for the first time. He doesn't say anything with substance. Saying that everyone and everything is bad is really not an example of a well formed agrument. I don't believe the way he is praised. In my country {Belgium}, my newspaper which is seen as a quality newspaper published his essay today. I couldn't believe it. He is famous and said a few things and he is looked as a man with ideas. Embarassing.

Second: he used the phrase: ""Where there is profit, there is also deficit"". What does he mean by that? It is a very empty phrase. There is a lot of sorts of deficit, but personally I think he meant loss [which is a very different thing]. A man who doesn't know anything about the economy shouldn't talk about the economy, and for sure if he doesn't know the difference between loss and deficit [and even with loss the quote is without any sense]. Rothbard once said: ""It is no crime to be ignorant of economics, which is, after all, a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a 'dismal science.' But it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance."" [saw it on a subreddit yesterday with Brands quotes and thought it was appropriate]. I also like a quote of Hayek in this context: ""The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.""

He also want a socialist egalitarian society. This means that the corporations, energy and everyhting is owned [completely] by the goverment. That's the goal of this society. I am not saying there is anything wrong with that [personally I don't think it can work]. And yet he stills talk about corporations and energy providers like they would function like today, just heavily taxed. So what does he want? A society with a market and heavily taxed corporations? Or a socialist society? Or did he mean a more Marxist point of view on society? I have no idea at this point. 

He wants a revolution? He thinks a revolution will make everything better? A revolution is no picnic, many people will be worse off. Look at Syria, they are fighting in a revolution. That's what a revolution looks like. No revolution will be easy, quick and without problems. You want change? A revolution will bring change, but maybe not the change you want. Look at how the USSR turned out, how China turned out, how North Korea and Cuba turned out. It could turn out just the same if you have a revolution here.

And if you agree with his points and want a revolution, please read some books instead of listening and reading him. He is very eloquent and has a lot of charisma but he didn't say anything new or better than what already has been said. He said it himself and still people look to him just because he is famous. You want intelligent rhetoric with substance: read on the subject. 

Like I said: first years at university say the exact same thing and I am not impressed because Brand says it in a more eloquent way.

Ici un opposant UMP, Gilles, qui ironise en soutenant Samia Galib, et Mennucci réplique en disant ""Ça sera bien la première fois que tu seras gentil avec une Arabe"" . Il prétend donc que Gilles discrimine les personnes d'origine arabes (en utilisant forcement le mot utilisé pour les décrire). 

Difficile de dire si cela est vrai sans connaitre les personnes, cependant, la suite est intéressante.

Au lieu de contester cette affirmation, ce Gilles va dénoncer le fait que Mennucci a utilisé le mot ""arabe"". C'est assez révélateur, car cela veut dire que pour lui, ce n'est pas la discrimination qu'il faut éviter, mais d'utiliser des mots ou termes qui pourraient la dénoter. Un peu comme les bon gros antisémites vont dire ""J'ai pas dit juif, j'ai pas dit juif !!"" et se répandre en propos nauséabond sur les ""sionistes"".

Le commentaire qui résume mon opinion est [ici](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1p7ejc/impensable_abandon_du_droit_du_sol/cczlbun). Je n'ai pas grand chose à ajouter.

Weber, je n'ai lu que l'*Éthique*, je n'ai pas du tout été convaincu (les protestants seraient riches parce qu'ils travaillent plus ???). À la limite, qu'ils soient plus riches parce qu'ils pensent plus à eux et qu'ils trouvent normal d'exploiter l'autre, je veux bien. Mais le travail et le mérite comme origine du capitalisme (qui au passage existait déjà depuis très longtemps)... non. Le catholicisme n'aime pas l'argent, ne permet pas le prêt à intérêt, ne croit pas à la prédestination, voire même l'inverse ([ce passage de Matthieu](http://bible.evangiles.free.fr/matthieu%2020.html) ferait bondir tout patron). Bref, le catholicisme est anti-capitaliste.

""De même qu'on dit aujourd'hui un ""non-voyant"" pour ne pas choquer la susceptibilité des aveugles, ou une ""non-bandante"" pour ne pas choquer la susceptibilité des boudins, on devrait créer un néologisme pour ne pas choquer la susceptibilité des corses. On pourrait dire les ""non-bossants"" par exemple. C'est une simple question de délicatesse.

Ainsi moi qui vous parle, j'ai un beau-frère nain, cul-de-jatte, manchot, sourd, muet, con et pacifiste. Pour égayer sa vie, il suffirait que nous l'appelions le non-grandissant, non-gambadant, non-embrassant, non-entendant, non-jactant et non comprenant, et non-violent. Je dis ""non-violent"" parce que quand je lui balance mon poing dans la gueule, c'est rare qu'il me m'rende.

Tout cela, répétons-le, est affaire de délicatesse. On ne dit plus un ""infirme"", on dit un ""handicapé"". On ne dit plus ""un vieux"", on dit ""une personne du troisième âge"".
Pourquoi alors continue-t-on à dire ""un jeune"", et non pas ""une personne du premier âge"" ? Est-ce que dans l'esprit des beaux messieurs bureaucratiques qui ont inventé ces merveilleux néologismes, la vieillesse serait une période de vie infamante au point qu'on ne peut plus l'appeler par son nom ? Est-ce que nous vivons au siècle de l'hypocrisie suprême ?
Y'a de plus en plus de vieux. Ils meurent de plus en plus seuls ; on les retrouve souvent recroquevillés dans leur mansarde, avec le crucifix sur le ventre et le squelette du chat à côté, morts depuis des semaines et des mois, si l'on en croît les gazettes. Ou alors, ils moisissent et s'éteignent dans des mouroirs provinciaux bien proprets, dans l'indifférence générale, car les jeunes ont le problème de la vignette moto - faut vraiment les comprendre.

Tout cela serait horrible, mais, MAIS on dit ""personne du troisième âge"" au lieu de dire ""vieux"", et le problème est résolu.

Y'a de moins en moins de ""pauvres vieux"", mais de plus en plus de ""jouyeux troisième-âgiste"".

**CSSD** - social democrats, had 56/200 seats in the last parliamentary elections in 2010. After the corruption scandal of the last government (the reason for early elections) they were expected to gain much more but due to a weak campaign they will most probably end around 25-28% (if you trust polls conducted before the actual elections). Proclaimed it won't cooperate with ~~ANO~~ TOP09 and ODS

**TOP 09** led by Karl Schwarzenberg (unsuccessful candidate in the last presidential elections). Fiscal conservatives, pro-European. 42/200 seats in the last elections

**ANO** a reactionary party let by a multibillionare Babis - owner of Agrofert - an agricultural conglomerate, 2 newspapers and more (the small Berlusconi). The party does not have a clear ideology and according to their press conferences they want ""effective public services and government"" and to ""stop corruption"" so you can imagine how dedicated they have to be. People are voting for them due to disappointments with the former government and I have heard that because Babis is already a multibillionare, he won't steal as much :)

**KSCM** communist party. Was in isolation since the velvet revolution but recently CSSD started to form coalitions with them in regional elections and both parties are open to cooperation after today's elections. 26/200 seats

**KDU-CSL** Christian democrats (social conservatives and the rest),one of the traditional parties but had 0 seats after last elections.

The one which broke its neck was twofold: (1) secretary and mistress of the prime minister ordered military intelligence to spy on prime minister's wife, (2) in exchange for leaving the parliament few dissenting MPs were bribed with cushy jobs in state owned companies. The second case already fizzled out.

The president then named new government made out of his cronies. It failed to obtain support in the parliament but the parliament was too fragmented to select someone else and dissolved itself. Two months later we have the elections.

There are 24 parties participating.


1. **[Social Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Social_Democratic_Party)**. Center left party in slow decline, more like a collection of regional bosses. Latest scandal was about the boss of Central Bohemia who was plundering EU subsidies left and right.  Expected to obtain most of the votes, about 25%. *[obtained 20,45%, 50 seats ouf of 200]*

2. **Civic Democratic Party**  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Democratic_Party_(Czech_Republic). Center right party in steep decline. Supported by local capital. Ruled for most of the last 25 years, now they will be lucky to get into the parliament. Listing their scandals would collapse the server. *[obtained 7,72%, 16 seats]*

3. **[Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_and_Democratic_Union_%E2%80%93_Czechoslovak_People%27s_Party)**. Center party willing to participate in any government. After too many scandals its most corrupt members feared about their political future. They escaped the sinking ship and founded ""clean"" party TOP09. They rump party struggles for survival. May or may not enter the parliament (the limit is 5%). *[obtained 6,78%, 14 seats]*

4. **[TOP09](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP_09)**. Party founded by those who saw no future in their original party (above). Tries to dismantle the social system, supported by multinational capital. Lot of money and professional election campaign. *[obtained 11,99%, 26 seats]*


5. **[Party of Civic Rights – Zemanovci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Civic_Rights_%E2%80%93_Zemanovci)**. Party of current president cronies. They want power. Some small chance to enter the parliament. *[obtained 1,51%, no seat]*

6. **[Communist Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia)**. Partly nostalgic for social security of the past, partly nationalistic and conservative party, nothing like a New Left. Thought to die off naturally but instead slowly getting stronger. Helped by no participation in the scandals during last ~25 years. May be second of third largest party. *[obtained 14,91%, 33 seats]*

7. **Party of [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomio_Okamura)**. Established very recently, populist. *[obtained  6,88%, 14 seats]*

8. **[Action of Dissatisfied Citizens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_of_Dissatisfied_Citizens)**. Party of a billionaire who wants to keep his agricultural EU subsidies and biofuels subsidies forever. Populist, he promises everything to everybody. Lot of money thrown into the election campaign can make them second or the third. *[obtained 18,65%, 47 seats]*

9. **Green Party** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(Czech_Republic). The closest to the New Left. Supports immigration, multiculturalism, etc. Was decimated by their willingness to participate in a right-wing government plundering the country. If really lucky they will enter the parliament. *[obtained 3,19%, no seat]*

true,prosthetic4head,CZEC,Czech Republic,"The main issue is who is going to form the next government and how Zeman (the president) is going to effect or manipulate the outcome?

The party in the lead right now, the **Social Democrats (CSSD)**, are ""center-left"". They've proposed higher taxes on businesses and people earning more than 100,000kc/month (~€4,000) and some other expansions of the social system.

The party in 2nd as I write this, **ANO**, is a bit of a mystery. It was started two years ago by the second richest man in the country. It's mainly a populist party and their ""program"" is a bit lacking: [it's in czech but you can see there isn't much meat on it](http://www.anobudelip.cz/program/). So who knows how they'll actually govern. I believe CSSD has said they would not coalition with them.

The party in third place right now is the **communist party**...enough said.

What's interesting is that **ODS**, the party which formed the last coalition and was brought down by scandal this summer, is just barely past the threshold to enter. They are just above 6%, down from 20% in 2010.

Edit: So, CSSD might try to form a coalition with the communists, although some of their members have said they don't want to. CSSD has also said they might try to form a minority government if they reach 33%. Right now it seems like there will be a lot of political rangling in the coming days/weeks, with Zeman trying to extend his influence and presidential power, which is quite limited now but which he believes should be expanded because of the ""mandate"" his election gave him. Pretty grim, IMHO.

If anyone has more information about ANO, I'd love to see it.

About 59,5% of eligible voters bothered to the voting booth. This is slightly lower number then during last election, the long term trend is downward.

My tip is that the parties will be unable to form a stable government and there will be new elections during the Spring. Today's de-facto winner, ANO, will fail them.

true,amon-pl,null,null,"I understand your viewpoint, but it isn't helpful. Let's assume a fictional country called Unland (short: UL). Your country has been allied with UL for decades, and your economy depends on trade with UL. But it is clear that the US are the junior partner in this relationship.

One morning you wake up, and turn on the news channel while eating your cereal, like you always do. Usually you don't pay much attention and just wait for the weather report. But today there are no headlines – only one topic:

&gt; “Yesterday, an anonymous defector from the Unland Secret Service (USS) has distributed a cache with thousands of sensitive documents to selected news agencies around the world. The documents are currently being analyzed by our reporters, but it seems that Unland has engaged in global surveillance on an unprecedented scale. In todays edition of the Canadian newspaper ‘The Watcher’, internal training material of the USS has been publicized for the first time. Mr. Rei Porta, what do these slides tell us?”
&gt; 
&gt; Porta: “According to these documents, Unland has found ways to tap into the Internet data stream, and is able to record and analyze it in real time. Every email, every Google search, each private message on Facebook – they have it, and have it fully analyzed, and have cross-referenced the data with your name, adress, telephone number and social security number. They know exactly who your friends and family are.”
&gt; 
&gt; “That is absolutely shocking. Why do you think Unland is doing this? It has always been though that the US and Unland were close allies?”
&gt; 
&gt; Porta: “Well, the training materials refer to this as ‘terror prevention’ – which is bullshit, considering that no serious terrorist would use unencrypted channels. One document refers to the US as an ‘observation level 3’ country, a rating usually reserved for actually relevant countries like Syria or Iran. It seems the Unland SS is trying to aid its struggling economy with massive industrial espionage. This would be a massive breach of trust. It's hard to imagine the President not re-evaluating our foreign relations with Unland.”

But no re-evaluation happens. Some minister visits the USS and is ordered to drink some Kool-Aid. Upon return, he declares the whole matter “settled”, and states that “no United States laws are violated with this surveillance”.

During the next few weeks, new information surfaces: The USS can circumvent common encryption, it manipulates certain security-sensitive algorithms, and the operating system on your computer is called “Nanosoft Curtains 7” – developed by a company with close ties to the USS.

Your whole perception of privacy and security is forcefully deconstructed. How can you remain secure? How can you protect your daughter from these pervs? You feel powerless, so weak and powerless.

And angry. Unbelievably irate, at the Unland government for this affront. And at your own government for avoiding the topic. Some Unlandian twits love rubbing salt into the wound: “*Hur dur, the Unland constitution doesn't grant you any protection – you aren't even real people*”. Yes, I fucking well know how UL doesn't respect human rights, but that doesn't justify their actions. “*Every nation gathers intel*”. Yes, yes of course. But not on this ginormous scale. Not on each insignificant citizen. And friends don't spy on friends. How would you feel about your girlfriend logging into your Facebook and check your private messages to ensure your faithfulness? For a sane person, this would be a *massive* red flag. In the eyes of US people, Unland is disqualifying itself as a trustworthy partner.

And then another bomb drops: The Oval Office has been bugged by Unlandian operatives. The President logs a complaint at the Unland government to save face in front of his voters, but nothing is going to change: He already knew, and his administration authorized it. And you? You can't change anything. All you can do is browse Reddit and vent your angry frustration about the Unland surveillance and your own politicians silence into excessively long comments.

Specific to Germans, there are a few other details that should be mentioned:

 1. East Germany had the Stasi, the only other surveillance project in history with this detailed resolution. There were as few as six unwitting citizens per informant. Married couples spied on each other. There literally was a file on everybody. Never ought such a dictatorship happen again.
 2. The US have no security interest in watching Germany especially closely. We are *allies*, for fucks sake. Parts of Nato command infrastructure are located in Germany. German troops fought with yours in Afghanistan. Our economies are deeply entangled. There is no way Germany would suddenly decide “oops, not interested, we wanna play Blitzkrieg again”. Also, the German populace is far too anti-war for that.
 3. During the last 60 years, Europe has enjoyed a period of peace. Intra-European borders don't have barbed wire or checkpoints; the line only exists on a map. At last, German conscriptions has been suspended. The average citizen can't imagine why we would want to fight another war. We don't really understand the “national security” argument the way US people might do. ",0,1382796806,null,0,false,0,cd003jq,t3_1p6ptn,t1_cd003jq,t1_cczws7r,null,1428977564,3,false,de,t5_22i0,3

On gardait les cours magistraux et les TD, mais les élèves avait aussi un cours en ligne avec des exercices a faire et un quizz a soumettre a peu prés toutes les semaines. Du coup en théorie, ils était sensé arriver en TD avec toutes les bases et on pouvais leur faire faire des exercices plus intéressant.

Ça c’était la théorie.

En pratique, c’était plus difficile. D'abord il y avait les gens qui avaient ""rater"" le premier cours d'amphi et qui du coup n’était pas au courant pour le système en ligne. Il y avait aussi les gens qui n'avaient pas accès a des ordis chez eux, quelque chose comme un et deux par groupe de TD (environ 25 personne). La fac laissait a disposition un parc de vieille machines mais c’était pas terrible, parce que elles etaient prise d'assaut pratiquement toutes la journée et les seule moments dispo etait le matin vers 6h-7h du mat et le soir vers 19h-21h. Évidement quand tu est en banlieu et que tu as une heure de trajet , c'est qu'a moitié pratique.

Il y avait aussi les gens qui preparaient veto et qui ragaient qu'on les ""force"" a travailler un sujet qui n'est pas dans leur concours. D'une façon plus general il y avaient les gens qui de toutes façon comprenaient pas pourquoi ils faisaient de l'info, ceux qui nous en voulaient de les forcer a travailler, ceux qui n'aimaient pas qu'on perturbe leur planning de travail, ceux qui trouvaient qu'on servait a rien vu qu'ils faisaient tous le boulot, ceux qui oubliaient régulièrement de faire les cours en ligne, ceux qui trouvaient qu'on donnaient trop de travail et , évidement, les quelqu’un qui sont arriver les mains dans les poches le derniers cours pour voir comment ça se passait les examens tout ça.

Du coté enseignant, c’était pas non plus une sinécure. La correction du quizz etait automatique mais on se tapaient la correction des exercices en lignes (qu'on essayait de renvoyer corriger pour le cours suivant), des TD (qu'on notaient a la volée) et de l'exam (qui était pratique, ce qui n'a pas simplifier la tâches). le responsable de l'enseignement insistait aussi pour qu'on assiste aux cours et qu'on fassent les exercices en lignes pour qu'on sache précisément ce qu'ils étaient censé connaitre. 

Du coté des TD, pour les raisons suscité, il y avait toujours un bon tiers de la classe qui n'etait pas vraiment a jour pour les cours, ca faisait des TD trés intense ou l'on devait aider beaucoup plus que prévus les élèves. 

Mais au final, je suis pour, et plutôt deux fois qu'une, parce que pour tous nos malheurs, les éleves avaient fini par avoir un niveau satisfaisant.

Les plus gros des problèmes émanaient du choc culturel (les élèves ne s’attendaient pas a cette forme d'enseignement) et du manque de moyen (pas assez d'ordi en accés libre, trop de monde en TD, plateforme en ligne pas terrible). Rien que ne puisse être remédier avec un peu de temps et de volonté.

due to [legislation derived from WWII on the side of the allies](http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/39/39408/1.html) and dysfunctional oversight and legislation on the side of German agencies (see Foschepoth).  
  
I personally think (speculation), that if given the choice, instead of disabling unconstitutional mass surveillance and reclaiming sovereignty over the telecommunications infrastructure, our *Government agency* would ignore the constitution in favour of a first tier place within the five eyes. [This article by the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/world/europe/allegation-of-us-spying-on-merkel-puts-obama-at-crossroads.html?_r=0) strengthened my suspicions:  
  
&gt; But the sentiment is particularly potent in the case of a country like Germany, which has been critical for a number of American intelligence operations. The BND, Germany’s main intelligence agency, has pursued suspected terrorist cells and was critical to extracting information from an Iranian scientist whose computer hard drive revealed documents strongly suggesting Iran was working on the design of a nuclear warhead. It played a supporting role in trying to cripple Iran’s nuclear enrichment program, through the use of a cyberweapon.

&gt;A spokesman for the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., declined to comment about any American discussions with the Germans about the intelligence relationship between the two countries.

&gt;In the past, Germany has pushed for an agreement similar to the understanding that the United States has with Britain and three other English-speaking allies that prohibits spying on one another.  
  
The last paragraph is a synonym for this:

&gt; Franz, not his real name, worked for a major German bank for twenty-five years. In 2011 he confided to me that the Euro’s ‘good’ years, before 2008, had been the worst of his life. From 1999 to 2008 the pressure from his bank’s Frankfurt HQ on executives like him was relentless. Before the Euro, his job entailed flying around European capitals, assessing the credit worthiness of governments, local authorities, utilities, developers, local banks, large businesses; playing hard to get with them, and eventually signing off on loans that made sense to him. However, once the Euro was established the Frenzy began in earnest. HQ was pressurizing him incessantly to lend, lend, lend. When he warned them that increased lending would mean subprime loans to iffy customers, they couldn’t care less. It was all about securing a higher share of the Euro market than other banks – French banks in particular – who were also on a lending spree. And since total lending effected was linked to his and his bosses’ bonuses, Franz and his colleagues were sent to Dublin, to Madrid, to Athens, to every nook and cranny with a hitherto low level of indebtedness. Their mission? To increase it. “I lived the life of a predator lender”, he added.",0,1382802816,null,0,false,0,cd01r95,t3_1p8zze,t1_cd01r95,t1_cd0180o,null,1428976790,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Intendo dire che nonostante questo a me sembra un gran bel posto e mi da l'idea che se riesci a trovarti un lavoro, e magari una bella bionda/o (che di certo non mancano) non te ne vai più.

&gt;Yes, it was such a blessing that hundreds of thousands of people fleed Yugoslavia to work somewhere else. Such a blessing that you had to become a member of the communist party to progress in public life.

Lots of people also fled because they feared retribution for the subhuman activities they took part in during the war. Others fell victim to fascist sympathy or extreme nationalism. Some, coming from underdeveloped/ignored areas (Herzegovina) had plenty reason to emigrate, yes. I live in the US and have met quite a few people who left Yugoslavia and quite a few of them are as right-leaning as you'll find and would be quite happy to see an Ustaša-light regime come back.

As far as party membership goes, that's not necessarily true. My grandfather was a ship captain (for Jugolinija, later for foreign companies) and was never a party member.

Don't compare us with the Baltics. We were decades, if not centuries, behind most of Europe. What was largely a rural, agrarian, and highly illiterate area was hauled into the 20th century by a strong push for industrialization and education.

I never said it was perfect.

An unfortunate truth, however, I still think it's not as egregious as what went on in the kingdom.

&gt;So the only alternatives were that which had already happened?

What else was possible in 1945?

&gt;That's ridiculous. By what metric? Which states are you comparing? Slovenia and Croatia that were members of Austria-Hungary for the longest time? Or Kosovo which was economically at the level of Moldova?

Slovenia and Croatia were by far the most developed areas of the former Yugoslavia but a lot of it was decimated during the war. Also, industrialization was concentrated in very few areas. If you stepped outside of Ljubljana, Pula, Rijeka, or Zagreb it was like stepping through a time machine.

Let's not go to absolutes. Nor does he imply an armed revolution. The enlightenment was a slow revolution, as was the renaissance, as was my country revolution of 74. 

I'm a reader of Marx from before college days. Marx begins the communist manifesto praising capitalist societies as being revolutionaries in their own right and by far the largest contributor to the modern age, in it's values, rights and quality of life. Please re-read the first chapter, if you suspect me lying. 

What Brand mentions is that modern society has been hijacked by the super rich. Corporations are legislating on their own behalf and getting away with it. They do it through shady deals and corruption. Through media and through puppets - the politicians.

Having read MANY MANY books that approach these issues. I'm sure I can plot the outcome of this. It leads to a world I don't want to live in. Representative democracy isn't working. Transparency isn't working and the controversy Solon considered as obligatory has little to no effect. Institutions designed to protect the public interest and the environment are not working. Corruption is everywhere and at the same time it is very insidious and camouflaged from the public eye. This means it was slowly educated into society and silently installed itself in power. It thrives on the sea of cynicism and apathy. Of course we think it can't be there, but at the same time we all observe its effects. It's a paradox! Or mass delusion. 

I agree we live in good times and to a good extent the status quo is shifting. The great normalization between genders, in countries the old 80/20 rule is shifting as wealth shifts. All good and expected things, but in the midst of all this rich keep getting richer and the class gap widens. It means bad things are to come, because we all know history and the human mind. Values we once took for granted have been changing and disappearing. Society is losing structure. Basic rights are being taken. Common sense is being thrown out the window. Short termism and galloping greed is destroying the planet.

Because it is small, there is great focus in our culture to learn foreign languages.

Of course, such an agreement would still have some value. Should the US get caught with its hands in the cookie jar again, it would very severely affect trust, and apart from tanks there's not much of another basis for international contracts than that.  
The true value of such an initiative lies in its ""failure"", though. Rejecting it would be pretty much equivalent to outright saying ""we will spy on you through any possible means, so don't use American equipment in sensitive areas, don't trust us to stick to agreements regarding the usage of data gathered through e.g., the SWIFT agreement, and keep US nationals on a need to know basis.""

And really, would you expect any less?  This is still the age of realpolitik.  The more information you have about foreign powers, the better your decisions will be.  It doesn't matter if we're friends or enemies, information is important.

Israel, for example, is caught spying on the US every couple years it seems -- yet we keep sending them billions of dollars annually.  They have a vested interst in knowing whats going on in our leaders heads, as they're dependent on that close financial relationship.  The US has a vested interest in maintaining a strong democratic ally in the mideast.  So even though we spy on each other, we still smile, shake hands, and hand money over because it's the best way to further our goals.  The spying is simply taken to be a part of that interdependence.

I think a similar type of interdependence exists between the US and the EU on matters of security (US bases and Europes reliance on the US as a deterrence), trade, and actions at the UN.

Neo-Marxism is all about economic Marxism, ya dingbat. It's Marxism that's been extended to include social justice values, but the principle of public ownership of the means of production remains. This contrasts with mainstream American liberal thought, in which government-backed solutions are pursued only if a workable market solution cannot be found. That's why a public option to complement the private plans was so heavily pushed by liberals during the healthcare debate. It wasn't just politicking; we genuinely prefer the public option to single payer.

While I am feeding straw to the fire, lets point out that people in those groups *are* unfairly disadvantaged. In my home state, hispanics and blacks, including those from what your smarmy tail would probably call ""good families"" face consistently unfair treatment from authority. A local Sheriff was recently kicked out of office by the feds because they found out that he was sending deputies out with the express purpose of rounding up Latinos. Probable cause doesn't matter to these yokels.

Hell, twenty years ago someone who was openly gay would not only face constant harassment at any non-niche job they got in this state, they would have had zero legal recourse. As it is, a frightening percentage of homeless youth in this country are homeless because their parents refused to raise a gay child.

&gt;Di cosa sei fiero? 

Del mio giuramento, dei miei uomini, del nostro mestiere e di servire il mio Paese.


&gt;Ti senti abbastanza utile alla società per giustificare i soldi pubblici spesi per te? 


Si. Guarda proprio ultimamente i nostri studi sull'autoprotezione degli aeromobili stanno venendo presi in considerazione per l'impiego su velivoli di linee civili. Poi la società sei tu, cittadino italiano: se ritieni che la spesa militare vada ulteriormente ridotta, dai il tuo voto alla parte politica che ti promette di farlo. Democrazia.

&gt;Non vedi nessun problema coi civili ammazzati in Libia, Iraq, Afganistan, India e così via? 

Nessuno di noi mira ai civili. Sono tragedie che io non mi permetto di sminuire. E si, abbiamo problemi. Non ci dormiamo la notte. Ci mandano lì e cerchiamo di fare il nostro dovere. Governi nazionali e organizzazioni internazionali decidono che tale è l'interesse del Paese/comunità internazionale. Te lo ripeto: fai in modo che il prossimo governo ci porti via di là. 
Noi non possiamo.

&gt;Nemmeno con l'utilizzo delle forze armate per il ""controllo del territorio"" qui in Italia?

Stesso discorso. È un interesse nazionale? È legittimo e costituzionale? Si fa del nostro meglio. Siamo professionisti.



&gt;A, allora è tutto a posto. Non importa che l'arma principale dei soldati italiani in Afganistan era [il pagamento del pizzo](http://www.france24.com/en/20091015-french-troops-ambushed-italy-bribes-times-afghanistan-taliban-military). Se ci sono sacrifici e delle belle uniformi si può perdonare tutto il resto e ringraziare **le** **F**orze **A**rmate come se niente fosse...

Chi te l'ha chiesto di ringraziarci? Io? Un mio collega? Chi te lo obbliga? Non mi devi niente. Non c'è nessun obbligo di legge, neanche un obbligo morale...guarda sei perfettamente libero di indignarti. 

Utilizza il tuo tempo in maniera più produttiva. Ma riconosci il diritto degli altri a rispettarci, se lo ritengono opportuno. E evita di giudicare con fretta.

Io intendevo che al meglio delle mie conoscenza il cristianesimo non è mai stata la religione predominante in Palestina, sopratutto quando le migliaia di testimoni oculari dei miracoli di Gesù o i loro discendenti diretti erano veri. Ma se tu conosci questa storia meglio di me, ti chiedo di spiegarmela o dirmi dove istruirmi (non sono sarcastico, sono serio)

-questa è una risposta assurda per una serie di motivi. 
1) intanto, chi dice una cosa simile e sulla base di cosa? cioè, per quale motivo l'interpretazione del magistero è quella giusta? Troppo comodo dire ""solo l'interpretazione che piace a me è valida, mi spiace, e chi non è andato alla ""mia"" scuola non può fare interpretazioni valide"". 


2)da dove viene la saggezza del magistero se non dalla bibbia stessa? e allora è un cane che si morde la coda, perchè tu mi chiedi di valutare la validità di un libro usando come metro la saggezza tratta proprio da quel libro li. Poi inventi questa categoria dei ""libri sacri"" che a volte narrano di fatti veri e storici (vedi la resurrezione) e un po' di allegorie e metafore (vedi la creazione, la stella cometa, l'invasione degli zombie...). 

È un po' come se mi chiedessi di valutare le qualità di una Dacia Logan, ma comparandola solo alle altre Dacia senza prendere come metro di paragone nessuna altra auto. Potrei scusarle qualunque difetto, dicendo ""è una Dacia eccezionale"" quando invece un giudizio onesto sarebbe ""è un'auto mediocre"".

So every old woman who has had a hard life in Serbia gets a state funeral? Cool, I had no idea...........

A) You defend them, as you do. 

B) You give their relatives state funerals. That is the highest respect.

Don't give me that shit. One can be respectful *without* giving a state funeral. Most countries are respectful, and *we don't give dictators relatives the highest honours we can*. So, yes, you are honoring dictators. 

If you *just* wanted to be respectful, you could just have given her a nice funeral. Paid for it, no expenses spared etc - but not a state funeral. So, no, you are far, far beyond respectful, you are saying that she is super great, and since she apparently didn't do anything, you are only honouring her because she is related to a dictator that had people killed. 

You don't see any other former communist countries running around honoring, and *defending* which you are, their former dictators, do you? Do you see the Romanians on this board doing it? Germans? Hardly, so yes, you are definately honoring dictators. You even will not admit to the fact that he was a dictatator and had people murdered. You are honouring him.

Oh boy, I don't even know where to begin. :)

In general terms, it is insanely context-dependent. The grammar is simple but unhelpful. Vocabulary and pronunciation are both unpredictable and very particular, due to centuries of varying influences. Some words are recognisable to Nordic speakers, but mean slightly different things and have varying connotations, also depending on the dialect of English (you better not be asking for the *toilet* in the US, and what does *cheers* even actually mean in the UK?), and cow is beef, and pig is pork, and sheep is mutton, and every word choice is not only an indication of semantic meaning, but also class, education, wealth, location, and oftentimes, messed up *just for laughs* (looking at you, Cockney).

[Here is a good list of examples that should horrify every non-native speaker.](http://rense.com/general95/englishcrazy.html)

English is clearly a language of people intent on not communicating among themselves. ;-)

But from my perspective, it's not all bad. When I say we have an advantage, speaking a related language, it is quite literally the case that many idioms are familiar from the get-go, because the exact equivalents exist in most other European languages. Imagine the confusion of a non-European faced with idioms such as ""a cold shoulder"" (well, wear a jumper?), or to ""not have a cow"", or to play the ""devil's advocate"", or to ""burn the bridges"", and the list goes on… Many popular idioms come to us through shared ancestry, and thankfully that goes for English too.",0,1382822664,null,0,1382822921,0,cd088ne,t3_1p9lq6,t1_cd088ne,t1_cd05tgs,null,1428973753,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7
