Your economies are growing and everything which is good, but I don't really know what is produced and/or exported there.

But to me, really, Latvia's just a very small country in Europe and the EU. I see Latvia and the people there as similar to people throughout the rest of Europe. I think they must be reasonably industrious otherwise they wouldn't have been accepted into the EU.

TL:DR/summarisation: Lativa is a small country in the EU with some reasons to be respected as a Western country, even if I am not 100% aware what those reasons are.

People were usually friendly towards us and many spoke English fairly well, especially the younger generationl. What we really noticed that, when speaking with several people during the music festival, was that they were really glad that we came all the way from the Netherlands to attend their festival. I got the feeling when speaking with Latvians that they saw it as a way to get some recognition for having a place within Europe too. Big European bands and people all over Europe coming to their visit. Spend some time sheltering from the rain under a few big trees talking with several Latvians and they expressed this feeling. 

However, it felt too that Latvia was seperated in two countries, two populations. Those Latvians and Russians cant seem to live together. One of my friends said that at the McDonalds they ask first if you are a russian or latvian speaking Latvian. The country is divided because of this alot. They might coexist but not with affection for each other.

Before the 2008 state elections in Hesse, she (SPD leader) vowed not to cooperate with the ""Linke"". After the elections, no stable government could be formed and she formed a red/green minority government with toleration from the ""Linke"". That lasted for about a year and in the resulting repeat election, SPD suffered a devastating loss, commonly attributed to them breaking their word. Since then, this has become a ""Gretchenfrage"" and I am very certain that with the exception of eastern German state governmnents, the SPD will not form a coalition with the Linke. The loss in voter confidence will be enormous.

Also, there is something called ""staatstragende Partei"". This refers to a party that embraces the fundamental ideas and doctrines that form the pillars of our system, and they don't demand crazy unrealistic stuff *all the time*. All these parties are theoretically able to come to a compromise withe each other. A compromise on a federal level with a party that is not ""staatstragend"" seems impossible.

Fundamental doctrines are, in rough order of importance (and off the top of my head)
* Liberty and Democracy (""Freiheitlich demokratische Grundordnung"")
* Capitalism with social component (""Soziale Marktwirtschaft"")
* Orientation to the west and integration into western allied structures (""Westbindung"")
* The right of Israel to exist (""Existenzrecht Israels"")
and maybe
* European Integration
* Denunciation of Nazi and communist injustice

true,Turminder_Xuss,GERM,4th World Cup &gt; 4th Reich,"That's a matter of perspective. Sure, there have been massive transfers to the east. But think about this: Before the wall fell, there was no unemployment, because under communism everyone has a job. Enter the reunification, where East German companies (""VEB"") that were not competitive were quickly dissolved or shrunk while the nice parts were bought up by West German companies. That means massive unemployment. Talk about permanent 8% more, say 5 in the west and 13 in the east, or so. This is still the case. Initially, the Linke (then PDS) would not make the 5% and only send two or three delegates into the Bundestag, on a direct mandate basis. In the early 2000s, the German economy was doing terribly. 4.5 million unemployed, federal budget a mess, you name it. The red/green coalition under Schröder enacted labor market reforms (Hartz I - IV). ""Hartz IV"" is now synonymous with unemployment benefits, which where cut dramatically. Official unemployment rose to over 5 million due to statistical changes. This reforms (also called ""Agenda 2010"") did cost Schröder the power and the social democrats a permanent 5-10% in political approval, a lot of it towards WASG (see below) and PDS. 

Under the impression of the cuts, a protest party formed in the west, the WASG. They were spearheaded by former SPD chairman and federal finance minister Oskar Lafontaine. Later, they merged with the PDS (successor party of east German  communist party ""SED"") to form the ""Linke"". In the west, the social democrats have lost a permanent 3% of the voters to them. This, in my opinion, are people on the left that before were SPD voters, but already quite extreme in demands favoring what others call socialism. Now, it's impossible for the SPD to cater for these because what they want is just impossible: Undo labor market reforms, negative income tax for low earners, retreat from NATO, ...

(As a side remark: The conservatives have these extreme people still mainly voting CDU. Maybe that new anti Euro party will balance things out by removing the crazy people on the other side of the spectrum from coalition arithmetic, too)

In the east, I think their voters are made up of the following groups:
- People unhappy with the SPD and their move to the center, but leftish. Remember, an opposition party can demand all kinds of stuff and does not have to explain how to finance it
- People that think back in nostalgia (""Ostalgie"") into the DDR. Remembering full employment is easy, and forgetting that little bit of spying on you maybe, too (that is not objective, though).
- WASG opposition to Agenda 2010
- People that liked the SED or just vote for them because they always did
- People that like the way they act in state governments. The Linke are very strong in the East, sometimes almost the strongest political power. They are junior partner in several state governments, and doing not too bad there might get them voters. 
- People who like the party heads. These are not all stupid people, and some of them quite smart (Gysi) or popular (Petra Pau, for example made into the Bundestag on a direct mandate back in 1998 I think).

Also, while they are partly the successor party to the SED and there are a lot of crazy people there, they are still slowly transforming into a ""normal"" party. While it may not be enough (and I think those who say the SPD should open itself are wrong. The Linke needs to accept the pillars I outlined upthread), it makes them less scary then, say, the NPD (neo-nazis).

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Unemployment is high because there are people being laid off in the private sector. Companies have been closing because of higher taxes, the state not paying its bills and diminishing demand. The Greek state pays for the salaries in the public sector, which includes trains, buses, electricity unlike other European countries. In a capitalist economy jobs are supposed to be created by the private sector, which in Greece is non-existing.

A lot of things that are publicly owned in Greece are also publicly owned in other EU countries, especially the richer ones. All western economies are very much dependent on state intervention to create demand, regulate and sometimes outright hire people just to reduce unemployment. 

&gt; If the state becomes smaller it is likely that bureaucracy will be reduced and creating a company will become easier. 

This is a misconception. You need the actual bureaucracy to become smaller; just laying off random employees will not help you any. If anything, the layoffs will contribute to making the system more Byzantine, as the remaining few employees will struggle to make everything work. 

I don't see why having 15000 fewer civil servants will reduce the time needed to create a new company. It's more likely that the wait time will be increased because there won't be enough employees to perform the needed procedure, which will remain the same. 

&gt; I was thinking of people being paid by the state to work in administrative positions, even though they cannot use a computer and those who do not show up for work and still get paid. Many of the people who work for the state are there because of their political affiliation, not their skills.

Well, then you should want these particular people to lose their privileges or to be layed off. Your agreement with the general layoff scheme gives a carte blanche to the government to lay off whoever they want. 

&gt;  Of course I'm not saying that health and education should be privatised or that there should be lay-offs there.

I certainly hope you do something when an important public service gets layoffs then. 

&gt; If Greece had not been spending more than it produced the impact of the financial crisis would not have been as great.

You misunderstand how financial crises work. If no one spent more than they produced in the first place, you'd have deflation since other countries would have to lower their production because of the decreased demand. 

&gt; Political parties have put those people in work in exchange for their vote. How else can this vicious circle break? 

The vicious circle breaks by creating the institutions that will guarantee that civil servants are hired for their skills, not their political affiliations. I don't see how random layoffs help in that regard. 

&gt; No, the state does not intervene in the economy in any other western European country as much as it does in Greece. In the UK it takes a working week to get a company up and running. In Greece nobody knows.

That is simply not true. There is much state intervention everywhere. Companies need to hire specialised software firms just to comply with complex and sometimes contradictory laws all over Europe. The United States subsidises a huge military industrial complex, not to mention the corn subsidies. 

The time it takes it get a company up and running depends on specific factors, including how well the relevant government services are run and how complex the legislation regarding companies is. Just slashing the number of civil servants randomly will not have the desired effect.

The west should not ignore the case of Alexei Navalny
Ten years ago, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, then Russia’s richest man, was arrested on fraud charges after he began to pose a challenge to President Vladimir Putin. Today, in a court in Kirov, 900km from Moscow, begins the trial of a man far less well known than Mr Khodorkovsky, but which is no less significant for Russia’s future.


The case against Alexei Navalny is the culmination of the creeping clampdown since the protests of 2011 and Mr Putin’s return as president last year. That has included harassment of non-governmental organisations, ejecting USAID, imposing draconian fines on unsanctioned rallies and jailing two members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot.


The Navalny trial is a clear attempt to sideline a man who poses a genuine threat to the Kremlin. Polls show only a third of Russians know his name, and his flaws include worrying nationalist leanings. But the charismatic anti-graft blogger is the one figure who might conceivably unite Russia’s fragmented opposition and broaden its appeal.
He has propelled the issue of corruption among Russia’s “elites” to the heart of the political debate, rattling the Kremlin. He recently announced ambitions to stand for president in 2018, and perhaps run meanwhile as mayor of Moscow – where mounting Putin-fatigue could give him real support.


The charge that Mr Navalny stole Rbs16m ($500,000) from a state timber firm while advising a regional governor is paper-thin. A spokesman for Russia’s investigative committee admitted last week the case had been expedited because Mr Navalny was “using all his power to bring attention to himself”. The verdict, as in 99 per cent of Russian trials, will most surely be guilty; Mr Navalny could be jailed for 10 years. A suspended sentence would suffice for the Kremlin: a criminal record would bar him from elections.


The west is wary of harming already frosty relations with Russia. Yet it should not ignore the Navalny spectacle. Assuming the verdict is indeed guilty, the US Congress should consider adding the judge to Washington’s Magnitsky list of barred officials. The case for a similar EU list is ever stronger. The Council of Europe, meanwhile, as the guardian of Europe’s convention on human rights, should curtail Russia’s participation.


Such steps will provoke fury from Moscow. But appearing weak would make Mr Putin respect the west, and its values, even less than he does already.

&gt;What?

Let's spell out what it is your economic-political dream actually means, OrwellHuxley.   

You need the dream to survive, you say the only way is for a grand unification and Federalism - not one that you won't provide a choice on - but states failing now are going to have to wait to keep your dream alive.  They have to fail, and not only fail but continue suffering, because that is how the Eurozone economy will stay alive.  You've sacrificed them.

Well, people are going to die.  Hospitals are already running out of medicine, people are already fainting from lack of food, services altogether will collapse, and come the summer with inevitable powercuts when people can't pay their bills - the heat will kill even more.

You just turned around to every country that's suffering and told them that their suffering is secondary to your political aspirations.  That they're just going to have to wait as things get worse - for the good of Superstate you intend to bring to full gestation.   It's like a cross between *Rosemary's Baby* and *Nineteen Eighty Four*, and you're quite happy to put the Soma Spin on it, as this is *The People's Dream*.

When you say these people will have to wait so you can have your dream superstate, then you picked your username very well.

&gt;Nowhere did I mention that people shouldn't be asked.

You just deny that there's any other solution to ask/offer them, and then pretend to know their own minds having not asked them.

&gt;Mention the economies which are doing better, and are outside of the EZ

From the biggest to the more recent ascension states.   Sweden wouldn't swap for the EZ economy which is set for contraction, nor would the UK.  Poland has had one quarter of negative growth in ten years.    

The EZ is set for two years of contraction.

&gt;Not saving the euro means the destruction of euro zone economies.

Nope, it means destruction of the Eurozone, or at the very least it getting A LOT smaller.  It means the death of European Federalism.

&gt;Because the euro is like a gold standard. 

What's that got to do with Greek or Portuguese corruption?       
Don't answer - it's very much rhetorical.

She generalizes about ""burocracy booh bad thingy"" ""big State coroporations also boooh bad thingy"", which in itself seems like a sound point, but what she really means is the abolition of all State institutions even including those regarding Health and Education by ways of privatization.

Given the growing private debt in Europe (of banks and corporations) and the growing inequality between classes, I'd say her 'privatize all the things' solution would be even worse than not privatizing anything. 

Of course what Europe needs is compromise, but hopefull we won't fool around with the privatization of essential things like Health and Education that should not be at the stake of corporate profits when corruption and lack of accountability is the worst problem Europe is facing and will face at the business level, the State level but also at the 'Brussels level'.

We need more democracy and less corruption, that's it. Not this pseudo-visionary cultist ideologue bullshit coming out of the cunt's lips.

* Another example is that we don't like to give our name directly (except at work), the common way is to guess it by talking with other. Nobody will be vexed if you ask, but it will feel a bit awkward.

* If someone start correcting your French or give you unsolicited advice, you probably made a friend! From what I understand, friends in the US are expected to give support. In France, they give advice and criticism. Perhaps it will feel a bit rude at first, but roll with it, there is no meanness in this (especially correcting your French). 

* Conversation are expected to be interesting, which mean that people will often adopt a contrary view to you just to get thing going. That often seem a bit rude to American who prefer to try to reach consensus but that how thing is.

* As someone else said you have to show some common courtesy in shop or service will be shit. On the other hand, you should not see any fake smile.

* On clothes, it's not common to wear comfort clothe outside your home (and if your au pair, I would say outside your chamber if you want to be perfect).

Dunque, ci sono un paio di problemi.. 

Il capitale depositato nei BOT/BTP, una volta pagato, e' nelle casse dello stato, e non se ne va da nessuna parte; fuga di capitali vorrebbe dire che qualcuno sta spostando soldi dall'Italia alla Germania, e questo chiaramante non e' quello che sta succedendo.

In sintesi, non e' un problema di B e A, che si palleggiano titoli vecchi, ma il fatto che i titoli nuovi non vengono accettati a meno che l'interesse non sia alto (spread); questo riflette rischio, non fuga di capitali - e questo vale sia per investitori italiani che stranieri. In sostanza, non c'e' nessuna evidenza di un flusso di denaro dall'Italia verso la germania, o il resto d'Europa.

Per metterla in un altro modo: se fosse 'solo' fuga di capitali, una volta che il capitale e' fuggito il fenomeno si easaurirebbe.. ma se il rischio di default dell'Italia cresce (o viene percepito come crescente) NESSUNO ti presta piu' i soldi a basso interesse, ne' ora ne' mai - e questo e' quello che sta succedendo.

What he has been doing, for years, is publicly investigating and publishing proof of corruption at the highest levels, including billion-dollar thefts and corruption and law breaking (hiding assets abroad) by major political figures, including those who are targeting him now. He introduced crowd sourcing efforts to do the same (e.g. experts on specific areas can review government contracts and offers and evaluate if the money spent is reasonable). He also initiated campaigns about smaller issues that resonate with people in Russia, like failures by the state to maintain apartment buildings (many residents pay fees to the government instead of a private home owners association, and in return the state is meant to maintain common areas. Sometimes they do, sometimes things can get really bad). Navalny has real reach. For example, he created a term describing the ruling United Russia Party as ""the Party of Crooks and Thieves,"" and that phrase went viral in real life, now becoming part of the common discourse. 

These types of effort are far more threatening than an announced future potential presidential bid because they get attention and shake faith in the already-weak state. You don't have to like Navalny personally or want to vote for him to be infuriated by massive theft and corruption by those in power, or to be frustrated with the state's inability to provide basic services, and Navalny is an effective focus and encourager of those feelings.

Adding to that role, he is an important leader in the opposition. Less so for his specific actions in organizing protests, making speeches, planning campaigns, etcetra, and more because the opposition is not a united whole, and has many viewpoints and disagreements within it. Navalny is a good manager and diplomat, so he keeps the other guys rolling along better than they could without him. During the height of the protests last year organization effectively stopped while he was in jail for a few days - that's how vital his personal skills and connections are. 

Another problem with Navalny is that he has the attention of other countries, especially in the West. The Russian state is frustrated with ongoing criticism of Russia on democratic and human rights grounds and views it as a hypocritical excuse to block Russian endeavors abroad (sometimes it is used that way, sometimes it's just good-faith complaints about real problems). When Navalny speaks, the New York Times and the Economist quote him as gospel, while pronouncements by major state leaders are treated with skepticism. This is a real foreign policy obstacle and a personal frustration for state officials.

Which brings us to this current case. Navalny [put all of the materials online](http://navalny.ru/kirovles/) and he looks pretty innocent to me.  The prosecutors even dropped the case against him until they were ordered to reopen it by Head of The Investigative Committee of Russia Aleksander Bastrykin. Bastrykhin has staked some real personal capital on being the guy who will fix the Navalny problem. He also personally doesn't like Navalny. Among other things, Navalny caused Bastrykhin real personal career damage but publicizing Bastrykhin's residence permit and real estate holdings in the Czech Republic. CZ is a NATO country and it is illegal for Bastrykhin to have those things as long as he is in the government (he also just looks bad). Navalny also tanked the career of politician Vladimir Pekhtin and two of his allies after he published proof of that man's [illegal] holdings in Miami.

Previous efforts also failed. For example, an effort to get Navalny for embezzling funds from a now-defunct party fell apart when the party refused to change their statement that no money had been stolen by anyone. 

Now, Bastrykhin is moving despite the weak case. He has to show that he can get Navalny or his internal position will be at risk (in addition to his own problems, including opposition from the FSB, this is a time of instability for power holders, as reflected in their massive and occasionally public sniping and infighting). He is trying with this weak, weak case. He might win anyway - the courts have a history of delivering political decisions. A major sentence is unlikely - making Navalny into too much of a martyr is risky. However, a conviction will prohibit Navalny from standing for office. Even before he spoke of running for president, Navalny announced his intention of running for smaller office. Blocking him from that would have a symbolic value that opposition can't enter official structures. Its not much, but Bastrykhin needs to show something or he himself will be out.

Of course, maybe Navalny will get a longer sentence. That will hurt him and the opposition peoples, but it might raise his profile/make him a martyr and just gain him more support  while hurting Russian state interests abroad as well. Or not.

true,doubouil,Bretagne,Bretagne,"French people have a cliché of rudeness, but I heard from abroad friends that it can actually be quite true. Apart from the quite mandatory ""Bonjour/Au revoir"", people tends to sometimes act less kindly you could expect from. As a personal experience, I'd say more on the French Riviera than where I was before. The best example is people driving : honking is quite common, passing on orange light is often done, and we basically cross the road when we safely can, not when the light tells us to (which is to me how I know someone is french or not.)

A little out of topic, but some additional informations :

I lived near, so I can tell you that public transportation is a major problem if you wanna hang out elsewhere, assuming you can't drive of course. Also, without disrespect, Saint Jeannet is not the busiest/crowded place, even in summer ; compared to bigger cities near like Nice, Antibes or Cannes.

Some people tend to have a ""Provencal"" accent, I had hard times figuring out some gimmicks. Touristic places will handle English speaker easily, but some others won't so be prepared. Expect an italian influence since we're near the border.

Summer can be quite hot when you're that away from the sea, up in the mountains. Expect around 20°C in the morning in July/August, even at 10am. It can go up to 28-30°C in the afternoon depending on days. It's common to have air conditioning since you can't always keep windows wide open. The main reason would be ""Cigales"" (Cicada), who sings all day long ! Sky is completely blue, clouds comes and go. Also, it's not a windy place and rain is rare in the summer.

Price and cost of life is basically higher than on other place in France, a café in a bar is around 1.20€, bread is around 1€, a cigarette pack is ~7€, seeing a movie range from 8 to 10€ depending on offers, a cocktail is around 10€ too. People tend not to talk about money itself, but it's quite easy to figure it (trivia : people have a flat, or a ""Villa"" ; there's no inbetween here).

Unfortunately, you may get annoyed by people complementing you ; and there's street scam and begging. It's a sad truth.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;If Zionism (I am still not sure) means the idea that Jews could have their own country,

Zionism is more specific. Zionism means that Jews have their own nation state in the Land of Israel. In other words, Zionism means that Jews have right to take the land from others and build their nation there.  Only small number of Jews lived in Palestine until Jews started to pour in.  Israel is the culmination of centuries of racism and colonialism.  Israel was given to Jews by foreigners against the will of locals and surrounding countries. 


The following is Israeli Declaration of Independence and it defines what Zionism is. 

&gt;ERETZ-ISRAEL [(Hebrew) – the Land of Israel, Palestine] was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped. Here they first attained to statehood, created cultural values of national and universal significance and gave to the world the eternal Book of Books.

&gt;After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom.

&gt;Impelled by this historic and traditional attachment, Jews strove in every successive generation to re-establish themselves in their ancient homeland. In recent decades they returned in their masses.

&gt;Pioneers ... and defenders, they made deserts bloom, revived the Hebrew language, built villages and towns, and created a thriving community controlling its own economy and culture, loving peace but knowing how to defend itself, bringing the blessings of progress to all the country's inhabitants, and aspiring towards independent nationhood. In 1897, at the summons of the spiritual father of the Jewish State, Theodore Herzl, the First Zionist Congress convened and proclaimed the right of the Jewish people to national rebirth in what it claimed to be its own country. This right was supported by the British government in the Balfour Declaration of November 2, 1917 and re-affirmed in the Mandate of the League of Nations which, in particular, gave international sanction to the historic connection between the Jewish people and Palestine and to the right of the Jewish people to rebuild its National Home.

Btw, you're not the only to take  the time to find a random quote. Here's mine:

&gt; Romania is situated in the part of Europe that was inhabited by peasant masses,
ruled for centuries by sovereign lords, clan leaders and autocrats.

&gt; Their answers are in any case long and complex and may to some extent reflect what you want to hear.

&gt; The Westerner, consequently, must be wary of the possibility of being cheated—a common occurrence in a region with a hybrid Balkan and Turkish historical background.

&gt; When the Romanians get down to business, their statements must be taken with a pinch of salt. If you disagree with them, show this obliquely, as they hate being snubbed in any way. Never tell them what to do—it would upset their superiority complex. In general Romanians are risk takers
(Turkish influence), and they will work hard to close a deal once everyone is on the same track.

&gt; Taboos include impolite or brusque behavior; blunt, direct remarks showing disagreement; and inquisitiveness as to personal details.

&gt; Always keep the Romanians’ animosity toward Hungarians in mind, but Romanians
suffer from a national persecution complex... Suspicion is a national habit.

&gt; Values: obsession to survive, opportunism, volatility, unpredictability, tendency to blame others, pride in being a Balkan anomaly, social corruption, nepotism, self-importance, sense of the ridiculous, black humor.

&gt; Avoid: 

&gt; * Praising Hungarians and their qualities.
&gt; * Aggressive questioning.
* Brusque behavior.
* Causing anybody to lose face (they are very sensitive).
* Any reference to the country’s backwardness, inefficiency and corruption.

Per quanto riguarda le politiche 'dettate' dall'Europa: nessuno ha dettato nulla, semplicemente la Germania si e' rifiutata di pagare i debiti Greci senza avere una contropartita in riforme; e' poi venuto fuori che le 'riforme' - per come sono state implementate - hanno fatto piu' danni che altro, ma il pasticcio originale e' tutto Greco..

Si puo' anche discutere sul fatto che occorrerebbe cercare forse una via un po' piu' basata sulla solidarieta' e meno sui numeri, ma e' dura - con interlocutori come Bossi, Grillo e Berlusconi, come puoi farti prendere sul serio? Che affidamento puo' dare un paese dove per far valere un contratto devi aspettare ANNI per una causa civile? Dove la scuola, la ricerca e l'istruzione sono a quel paese da decenni? Dove un giovane uscito dall'Universita' non puo' trovare lavoro in base al merito, ma solo in base a chi conosce papa'?

Il problema e' che le radici della decadenza italiana vengono da lontano: almeno un ventennio di sviluppo perduto. Non sara' facile recuperarlo, checche' ne dicano i ciarlatani delle 'soluzioni facili'. 

Il loro messaggio e' seducente: 'non e' colpa tua, e' l'Euro cattivo.' Come le sirene che facevano sfracellare i marinai sugli scogli..

true,gsoltesz,Bretagne,Bretagne,"Hi from a fellow scuba diver / water sports person. :) My region is **Bretagne** and I'd be happy to give you ideas of localities to visit on your way.

You'll likely want to do a 270° tour starting with **Mont Saint Michel**, going west on the North coast towards **St-Malo**.  Why not make an incursion onto the British isles of **Jersey &amp; Guernsey** while you're near, there are boats making the connection daily from St Malo. Also, diving in the Rance.

On your way to **St-Brieuc**, visiting smaller villages and places on your way (**Cap Fréhel**, etc). Further west, you must stop in **Perros-Guirec** and **Ploumanach** (region of **Lannion**) to visit the Pink Granite coastline.

**Brest** is the largest city after **Rennes** but I find it only mildly interesting; don't waste too much of your time there. You'll be better off going to the **Crozon** peninsula and spending a few days there surfing and cycling.

Going South, stop in **Douarnenez** and if you're lucky there will be some sort of maritime festival going on at the harbour. The summer period is always packed with such events.

The small medieval city of **Locronan** just south is worth visiting but don't spend more than half a day.

The south-west tip is the **Pays Bigouden** with smaller cities and villages such as **Le Guilvinec**, **Pont-l'Abbé**,  **Pointe de la Torche** (famous for surfing and windsurfing). Plenty of water and beach activities to do there. Choose the wilder **Baie d'Audierne** for more extreme sports such as surfing and speed-sailing, or the relatively quiet calm of the southern tip (**Loctudy**) for some sailing and beach bumming. Plan a day trip to les **Îles Glénan**, daily connections to Loctudy harbour.

On your way south and east now, stop in **Concarneau** and **Mousterlin** for more beach goodies.

Then, you'll have to visit the **Quiberon** peninsula and just outside, the sites of **Carnac** (local Stonehenge) and the **Golfe du Morbihan**. Plenty of nice visits to be done on foot all around, or by boat if you are so lucky to find an opportunity.

While you're there, take a boat to the isles of **Houat** and **Hoedic** and spend one day at one of the island beaches with friends.

Much further down (outside of Brittany now) there are **Les Sables d'Olonne**, l'**Île de Ré**, and west of **Bordeaux** in the estuary there's la **Dune du Pyla** worth climbing.

If you love surfing you'll want to stop in **Lacanau** and of course down south, in **Biarritz**.

In case you didn't notice, I love the west. ;) I'll leave it to others to comment further about other regions, there are so many of them worth visiting.

One last tip, about accommodation: try Couchsurfing to find a free bed on most days. When this doesn't work, just go to the local camp site, expect a lot of foreigners but with luck some people in your age group.

Pour les libéraux le vrai clivage n'est pas dans l'opposition gauche/droite puisque finalement gauche et droite sont tous deux pour une implication forte de l'Etat dans nos vies.

true,minnabruna,ASTR,Austria,"Actually, in this case, that 99% conviction rate is close to accurate. There are serious career penalties for prosecutors and judges who don't deliver convictions, so they just don't bring cases to trial with weak or borderline evidence that won't end in convictions and they do their best to ensure that what cases do make it to trial do end in convictions. You mentioned corruption to avoid conviction - that does exist, but typically prior to a trial. 

Authorities also have been known to target people who interfere with convictions, such as [this scientist whose testimony in a court case resulted in the defendant's acquittal and then her own arrest](http://www.nature.com/news/outcry-over-jailed-russian-chemist-1.11462). 

[Judges will sometimes even commit deliberate errors so that, if a conviction doesn't happen, prosecutors can appeal for a retrial and try again for that conviction](http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=732&amp;id=55374). 

That last source also mentions efforts to avoid using juries (used only in 0.5% of cases), in part because they deliver only an average 80% conviction rate (getting quality jurors is another challenge). If they do have jurors, it is not unheard of for officials to drag out cases so long that jurors must quit and get back to their lives and jobs and avoid an acquittal that way.

If you come back in a few, I'll have posted a source - if I fail to post an English one I'll post the Russian.

Update: [One English source](http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/europe/russias-99-conviction-rate-thrown-into-question)

Based on the figures mentioned [in this interview (transcript posted on the Russian Supreme Court homepage)](http://www.supcourt.ru/catalog.php?c1=%CD%EE%E2%EE%F1%F2%E8%20%E8%20%F1%EE%E1%FB%F2%E8%FF&amp;c2=%CF%F0%E5%F1%F1-%EE%E1%EE%E7%F0%E5%ED%E8%FF&amp;c3=2010&amp;id=6624)

PS In political cases, the conviction rate goes up to 99.99%. There are lots of things not to like about Khoderkovsky and Pussy Riot, but their trials didn't go purely according to the rule of law and Russia's criminal code. Sergei Udaltsov and Leonid Razvozzhayev, both opposition activists of different stripes and less famous, and therefore less safe, than Navalny, are currently facing trials on dubious charges (plotting to create mass disturbances).

Scusa - cut/paste.

Ho visto l'articolo e e' comprensibile che gli investitori esteri (specie i fondi pensione tedeschi, gia' colpiti dalla grecia) alleggeriscano le posizioni sui bond italiani e spagnoli. 
Il problema e' che Borghi diceva che la 'fuga di capitali' c'era gia' stata, e per questo uscire dall'Euro non e' poi questa gran tragedia. Ora, un conto sono fondi pensione che si spostano dall'Italia, un altro e' l'annuncio che l'Italia potrebbe uscire dall'Euro; questo vorrebbe dire che chiunque puo' (compagnie estere, investitori, piccoli risparmiatori, grande capitale) scapperebbe a gambe levate, per non incorrere nella 'tosatura' della svalutazione; aggiungi che siamo in Italia, quindi di sicuro (capital control o no), un bel po' prima del fatto gli amici degli amici ne sarebbero gia' informati.. altro che Cipro.

Poi, per non parlare quello che succederebbe nell'Euro area.. ci sarebbe probabilmente una disintegrazione dell'Euro, che rimarrebbe probabilmente in vigore solo in Germania e nel nord europa..

You were asked what failing countries should do beyond austerity policies and Eurobonds, given that you've since said that you don't now want to do the Eurobond thing straight away (after I pointed it would mean raising the cost of borrowing for those not in trouble and even push others over the edge).  

You answered with they'll just have to wait, and then had to ask why it would mean people in these failing countries would start dying - as if you had no empathy or understanding for the disastrous implications you were advocating, as if it were no more than a game of *Risk*.  

Let aside the irony of someone who calls themselves after George Orwell and Aldous Huxley  formulating a European superpower in their head through the manipulation of mutual indebtedness and arguing it as a justification for a *People's Dream* of a single European Superstate.

And the clincher for this being that the lucky few who actually have manageable lending rates are going to go into a common Euro-bond pot, not with already failing states, but states that will have failed because you want them to wait for assistance.  Forget 7% or 11% lending taking the average up.  They'll be through the ceiling by that point.  So now even the 'responsible' are being crucified.

They can't do anything, because there's no central government behind the euro.

Mutual indebtedness means a common bond - which means you're arguing that the Eurozone countries with low borrowing are going to get a considerable rise.

You say failing countries will have to wait until it cools down, then signal that the banking union is almost there and perhaps now these failing countries might be able to go into 'mutual indebtedness' (although nothing's cooled down), then you say you want to save the Eurozone economies but the price to pay is to see countries that aren't struggling to see borrowing go up and even argue for a hike that will surely push those already on the brink over.    

This is for a 'Dream of the People', a people that didn't want a constitution, and representatives that weren't even allowed to see the Enabling Treaty at Lisbon before voting on it.  

And you're arguing it that this is their only solution if they don't want their economies destroyed.  

Then you ask how you're asking for more of the same, whilst in the same breath talking of Dreams of the People, federalisation and more power going to a central European government.

You've barely said one thing that you've not managed to contradict yourself on immediately.   

You talk of strawmen, calling me a nationalist, when you're advocating the largest expansion of supranationalism since the USSR!  Then you talk about devolution of power to local authorities as, and I quote, ""beyond crazy"".

&gt;What? How is that even remotely similar to what I'm advocating for?

Wait, which of these goals aren't you in bed with already:   

- The creation of Europe a Nation through a common European government.

- The creation of an elected European parliament.   

- The continuation of national parliaments with their authority limited to social and cultural matters.   

- The creation of an economic alternative to capitalism and communism.

- USA, Russia, China and Europe acting as four equals i.e. need for a European trading bloc  (adjusted to be contemporary)   

- Europe to be defined as mainland (supranational) territory

Sounds to me you don't know what those in power talking about European Federalism actually advocate:

Post national in the sense of effectively forming one big, protectionist one.

true,otterplay,null,null,"Personally, I am of the opinion that it's very important to examine the social systems within countries independently - and not to model things out with the premise that there are ""large trends in human nature"" that affect all Western people the same way. It's true that the same kinds of political discussions are held in various nations in the same timeframes, but the cultural context is very different from nation to nation. That's how I feel, at least.

&gt; The Westboro Baptist Church exists. 

The Westboro Baptist Church is a vanishingly small group of perhaps 40 people who disagree with the rest of their nation about a lot of things. They paint brightly colored signs and talk about sin. They don't go out and vandalize and physically threaten people... let alone carry out those threats.

&gt; The KKK openly holds rallies all the time

Yes, of course the KKK is still an active organization - but it isn't a criminal organization anymore that carries out lynchings. 

There aren't the sorts of Canadian laws here in the USA that would prevent these sorts of public rhetoric.

Honestly, the last time we had any kind of bona fide white supremacy movement in the USA seems like it would have been in the early 1990s. According to my personal observations, it took shape after the Waco disaster, and had its main strongholds in places like northern Idaho. The movement quickly fizzled after  Timothy McVeigh's Oklahoma City bombing, when people realized that they didn't want to be a part of something that could do such a terrible thing.

When I myself have traveled in the deep South - in Florida, and Louisiana - my gut feeling has been that white people are actually more liable to fall under suspicion than black people are. I was in a bus station there in Lafayette one day, and there was a television news program blaring about a statewide ""man hunt"" underway for a white guy with short hair; I tell you, it made me feel a bit nervous, because I was also a white guy with short hair. Of course, that's not to say that there aren't terrible inequities when it comes to prison demographics, or that black people still aren't struggling in the USA.

I tend to feel, when I hear the German media giving these Neo Nazis legitimacy with the label ""far right political groups"" - that there must be in some quarters within the mainstream, a sort of backhanded sympathy for that kind of crass ethnically-specific nationalism of the sort that is frankly unthinkable here in North America in the early 21st century.

I agree with you that because of our decades-long national discussion in the USA about racism and oppression, we actually have sort of worked it out in a way it has not been yet, in countries like Germany or Australia. I was always kind of taken aback when I lived in Germany by my Gesamtschule peers, who had such strong criticisms to talk to me about, regarding how the US treated black people...when West Germans themselves at that time were quite blind to their own unique forms of racism towards immigrant groups such as the Turks. Thankfully, I see that the issue of racism and xenophobia in Germany has started to become a bonafide topic of discussion over the last twenty years since reunification.

Sigh... I guess no nation is perfect. ",0,1366156593,null,0,1366158325,0,c9gn1y2,t3_1chrrf,t1_c9gn1y2,t1_c9gmge8,null,1431532671,-4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,-4

This is not just *a* recession. This is *the* recession. There are fewer nets to fall back on this time. There are no home gardens or rural farms to be worked. The only viable alternative is going abroad. The thing is, you still have a middle class, much more than we had 30 years ago, but the lowest class is growing fast and is falling through the bottom. That is, they're basically scavenging, depending on charity or resorting to petty crime. 

The ideological clouding IS sequitur. The ruling party and our prime keeps claiming this isn't happening. Well, far from sight and far from the political pain of dealing with it. Besides, they've made clear what their priorities are. I don't trust them nor do I believe anything they say.

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","Well, to your first question, if a minority has a problem, it's mostly the Turks who make the biggest fuss about it. If I talk about that with Russians, Poles, Greeks, it's mostly something like ""Well, I'd like to have my native language as a class in school but it's not that important since I could learn it on my own"" or ""I'd love to have the German citizenship but I have a permanent residence permission so I don't actually need it"". You know... reasonable critique mixed with common sense.  But some Turks (I actually don't feel comfortable with calling them Turks since most of them are born here in the 3rd generation or something like that but I suppose you know what I mean, don't you?) just get crazy over that and demand change immediately and the Germans are all racist for not doing that fast enough and so on... But what pisses me off is the ignorance against the other minorities. It's almost never ""We should have classes for the languages of the biggest minority groups so children can learn their native language in school"" or ""We should find some other way to give minorities a way to keep their citizenship but have more rights in Germany"". It's always ""Germans should learn Turkish to improve integration"" or ""Germany should give the Turks the possibility to keep their Turkish passport to improve integration"". It almost sounds like the ""Turks with immigration background"" think they're better than the Russians or other minorities. And if I think about my Russian friends, it's mostly a weird easier version of Russian they speak because nobody of them actually speaks proper Russian and all of them can't write it. Mostly because the parents thought ""We're in Germany now and I want my child to speak proper German"" so they didn't teach their children Russian. So those children would actually benefit a lot from it. 

To the second question, it's not pushed officially. It's mostly angry Turks backed by hippy hipsters from Berlin who totally agree with that (those are also the same people that speak to black people on university campuses like they're retards because they want to ""respect that their German isn't that good""). Obviously, if you're working with children in Neukölln (that's a district in Berlin) where half the parents of those children can't build a straight German sentence would benefit from learning Turkish since there's almost no other way to be sure that the parents you're talking to actually understand what you're telling them.

You seem to have failed to grasp what I said, again. I'm not claiming that there isn't poverty or hunger in Portugal. It's just not widespread - not yet, at least. The crux lies in the fact that you rhetoric is not factual - instead, you are basing your argument on anecdotal evidence while extrapolating conclusions from articles with poor data. 

It's non sequitur, because it's not even true. While the government tries to downplay the relevence of the effects of their austerity policies and also avoids the issue actively, it has not denied the trend of increasing poverty and hardship. Regardless, this isn't relevant in the least. The government's stance doesn't change the fact that you have chosen to post sensationalist claims without proper backing or adequate sources.

You're a part-time teacher? Not relevant. Cantines are now open for longer periods? While I know this to be true, it doesn't imply that poverty and hunger are widespread - nothing more than conjecture and anecdotal evidence. *Sigh*. Why do I even bother?

* Riga is a (mostly) beautiful city with a rich culture (it looked quite Rhinelandish to me, to be honest), but when you actually drive through Latvia itself, it just seems to consist of a whole lot of plains.

*  I believe most people in Europe bunch Latvia together with its neighbouring countries because of the [Singing Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_Revolution). It was kind of a uniquely Baltic thing, so there you go.

* Whereas the Baltic-German influence seems to have almost entirely dissipated through time, the Russification can of course still be felt very clearly. It's like there's Latvians and then there's Russian-descendant Latvians, and a lot of people appear to refuse to learn or speak the other party's language, even though diglossia does appear to be a thing (with the random German-speaking folk every now and then). Russian not being recognised as a second official language probably doesn't help much.

* I really love your [folk music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-99VOCqTcU).

* To someone who's native tongue is a Germanic language, yours is surprisingly not confusing once one gets over the fact that definiteness is not expressed via articles. Random funny fact: I know a Russian couple with friends in Siberia who speak Latgalian. Now, something like Finnish on the other side of the pond, though...

Also the situation is even more complex: Labor reforms were made by the social democrat-green government which ruled until 2005 and was followed by a big coalition of christian democrats and social democrats, which gave way to the coalition that's currently in power. Most of the work was done by the last two coalitions and even in the big coalition social democrat secretaries did most of the hard work (labor, defense, foreign politics), while christian democrats sat there (for the most part) and harvested the crops came election time.

By the description of your studies I'm guessing you'll be at the CLM. If not, feel free to skip this paragraph. :) The school organizes dozens of trips each month, ranging from local to regional. Take advantage of them - many are only 5 or 10 euros. Visit the Alhambra early in the fall while the flowers are still in bloom. Take a trip to the beach before it gets cold. 

I won't rehash much of what other commenters have said, but it's pretty easy to blend in if you give it half a shot. I considered my Spanish to be intermediate when I first arrived, and it wasn't uncommon for native speakers to be frustrated with my seemingly imperfect grammar... but don't let this discourage you. Just give it a good shot and that's all you can do.

Make friends with as many people as possible; this will be your best chance of meeting native speakers. I'm not a very inherently outgoing person, and I relied on the girls from my University to meet locals. This is one thing I regret, because they will be your best opportunity to truly speak and learn the language, and the people you miss most after you return home. So if you have the guts to start up random conversations at bars or find community activities to participate in, do it. One of the girls I came with joined a gym, another attended church (she was there for a year), and I met people I still keep in contact with through both of them. And make a pact with any friends you're able to speak English with to only speak Spanish with each other. You'll thank yourself for it later.

One final piece of advice... salsa dance, even if you think you can't dance. And don't be afraid of men who ask you to dance with them - they're harmless, I promise. Drink lots of tinto, stay out all night and make your way back home at 5 in the morning, doner kebab in your left hand, shining Alhambra to your right.

true,thatfool,null,null,"1. It's not a passport. It's a *Wehrpass*, which documents military service. This is not Nazi specific, it existed both before and after, although we don't have them anymore now. The Wehrpass was given to new recruits after Musterung (examination for military service), but returned when they actually started with their first unit. From that point onward, it was kept by the unit, while the soldiers would carry a Soldbuch instead (containing more or less the same information, and actually acting as a passport).

2. The pictures don't give me any reason to believe it's not the Wehrpass of the person named. One Paul Hans Dietrich Fürkel (on page 3 it looks more like Fürskel), born in Jena on 22.11.1925 to parents Hermann and Gertrude (née Wagner). Nationality German, protestant, unmarried, probably just finished school (normal case anyway). You may have information I don't get from looking at the album.

3. The ""Hitlerjugend Leistungsabzeichen in Silber"" (Hitler Youth silver badge for proficiency or sth.) mentioned on page 4 is something pretty much everybody in the same situation would have had.

4. He passed Musterung on Aug 24, 1942 as ""kriegsverwendungsfähig"" (literally: suitable for use in war). He initially served in the Reichsarbeitsdienst (""...labour service""), which at the time (1943) was basically a support extension of the Wehrmacht that did not use weapons. There's some fluff there, of course he swore an oath on the Führer and so on, not too surprising for 1942/43...

5. He immediately volunteered for military service (Wehrmacht) after his Musterung and was accepted ""zum Abruf"" (on demand), but didn't enter service until August 1943. Page 12 contains a service record. He only served with the ""Werfer-Ersatz- und Ausbildungs-Abteilung 3"". The word ""Werfer"" refers to the Nebelwerfer, a mortar like weapon used to deliver chemical weapons. This unit was a training unit and did not see combat during his documented time with it. There should be a separate page for an actual combat record anyway which I don't see in the album, so I'm assuming it's blank (says something like ""Im Krieg mitgemachte Gefechte"" at the top).

6. From the different styles and the lack of any copy markings (""duplicate"" stamps etc.) it looks like this is a first issue. Specifically, it's the one that was actually used during the war and not a duplicate given to next-of-kin as a memento. But the service record seems to end on August 13, 1944, and I can't tell why.

7. The text on the back of the photograph is a dedication: ""To my dear children"". It's written over a stamp that certifies the photograph as a ""Handwerkliches Lichtbild"", i.e. taken by an actual photographer who felt it was necessary to point this out. The word in the lower left corner of the rectangular part might be ""Hamburg"", possibly where the picture was taken. The rank insignia on the collar is that of a ""Gefreiter"" (private). The unit mark on the shoulder isn't visible enough, and the colour of the border would have been significant. A Nebelwerfer unit would use a dark red border, which would fit the photo. IMHO it could very well be the same person as on the photo in the Wehrpass a couple years later, which would make sense since that photo has to be a few years older because it was taken before he entered the military.",0,1366179545,null,0,1366180183,0,c9guswe,t3_1ci433,t1_c9guswe,t3_1ci433,null,1431528948,30,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,30

I think it's true that in general, Catalans are a bit more difficult to get close to than say people from the south of Spain. The flipside is that once you make friends with a Catalan person they are extremely loyal and friends for life. 

It's also true that some people move here with an arrogant or superior attitude - I hear comments all the time about how they don't do things like back home, or you can't get ""proper"" this or that. This kind of attitude will not help you be accepted here. 

Finally, making an effort to learn about the culture and the language will help immensely. What your friend described as nationalism isn't exactly that, but there is a strong sense of difference here and with a referendum on independence coming up you'll be better off if you understand the issues and can talk about them. Pick up a copy of [Barcelona](http://www.amazon.com/Barcelona-Robert-Hughes/dp/0679743839) by Robert Hughes - it's an interesting read and will give you some great insight into the when and why of Catalan culture. Same goes for the language - you'll hear Spanish all over the place, but making an effort to speak the local language will open doors for you.

true,kinmix,LATV,Latvia,"Great analysis, thanks for taking time and posting it here. But I would like  to offer my perspective. 

Navalny's anti-corruption activism is indeed admirable, however he's political stance as political stance of majority of liberal opposition is highly questionable. Here you mention that:
&gt;When Navalny speaks, the New York Times and the Economist quote him as gospel, while pronouncements by major state leaders are treated with skepticism. This is a real foreign policy obstacle and a personal frustration for state officials.

And this is indeed what liberal opposition is doing, they are undermining Russian efforts to negotiate better political and economic deals for the country. There is a Russian saying ""Не выноси сор из избы"" meaning something like ""don't get arguments outside the house"". And Russians hate when this stuff happens. Russians will readily bash and make fun of their government, but when someone else does it or when someone does it on the international stage, majority of Russians will cringe. And that's why the liberal opposition is still a minority (a vocal one but still...)

And about the legal case against him. You say:
&gt;Which brings us to this current case. Navalny put all of the materials online[1]  and he looks pretty innocent to me.

Well thats you taking his words as a gospel. What if he is actually guilty, do you think he would put any information which would incriminate him on his website?

true,diatomic,null,null,"I've never studied in Granada, but I live in Jaén (about 45 minutes north) and it's a lot of fun to spend a weekend down there. Great nightlife, and I had no trouble meeting guys (who were all polite and I didn't feel unsafe, though someone who lives there could tell you whether or not you should be comfortable walking around alone at night). Like another commenter said, if you're blonde, you'll be a novelty, but in a good way. Fair people from England, Germany, any obviously foreign country are known as guiris, but it's just something people poke fun at and it's not really a major insult.

There's lots of awesome tourist stuff to see in Granada (and all around Andalucía), so you should take advantage of that. You probably know about flamenco, lots of little cuevas with intimate performances. The Alhambra is a must of course, and in general it's a lovely city. Decent shopping too, if you're into that sort of thing. Free tapas at all the bars when you order a drink, such as a caña which is a small beer or a tinto de verano (red wine with fanta limón or club soda), etc.  

Outside Granada I recommend visiting Córdoba, Sevilla, Jaén is okay but there isn't much to see (we are the world capital of olive oil though!) but a bit further beyond are Baeza and Úbeda, which are two pretty small pueblos. To the south you've got Málaga, which isn't too impressive, but there are beaches (in Granada too though) and your largest airport. Granada does have a small airport, but most of the connections are between Barcelona and Madrid I believe. All the other cities are well-connected by bus and/or train and you shouldn't have any trouble getting around.

A word about your Spanish. Granada and other cities in Andalucía have a specific dialect that is probably very different from what you have studied as an American. I guess you already know about how Spaniards use vosotros and how the soft c and z are pronounced like 'th.' So, cerveza is /thervetha/ instead of /servesa/. But beyond that, Andaluces tend to drop their s at the end of words. It can be very subtle and you shouldn't force it at first, but you will notice it when you come. So if you order seis cervezas, it will sound like /sei thervetha/ when said quickly. Another thing is that they tend to swallow the middle syllable in some words, particularly in past participles. An example: Me lo ha enviado --&gt; me lo ha enviao (it all sort of runs together). Again, don't force it, but if you hear it, that's why. PM me if you want more advice on swearing, slang, etc ;) I'm familiar with this because I came here with next to no knowledge of Spanish and I learned with the dialect, it was terrifying.

Miscellaneous things. Weather is awesome, dry and sunny. It will probably still be hot when you come. Siesta is alive and well. Most shops close between 1:30-2 and 5 or 5:30 and all day Sunday. Huge pain in my ass but you get used to it. A lot of places are cash only or cash preferred and workers get pissy if you don't have exact change haha. Oh, one more thing about social interaction. I'm a pretty sarcastic person and at first a lot of people didn't really understand my sense of humor. Keep that in mind.

I hope all that is useful for you!

true,[deleted],null,null,"There is one thing very good in both countries that not all modern employers are located in big cities.  I worked in Wolverhampton and had a job invitation to Raubling, a small German town near Rosenheim, which is near München. Why is it so good? Because people like me who dislike apartment living and want a house can thus afford it. You will never buy a house in London on Berlin but in Wolverhampton (well, _near_ Wolverhampton) or Raubling it can be doable.

Anyway. Answer is Germany. The UK somehow lacks that ""discerning"" (anspruchsvoll) quality. In the UK it is somehow OK that things are dirty, worn, old, there is some green moss on the wall and never gets cleaned, the pub table is cracked and not quite clean, the food tastes bland even in the Thai restaurant, people don't really clean their homes, even washing up the kitchen weekly seems too much for some Brits when actually many German housewives do it daily, wearing tracksuits in public for fuck's sake, drinking Nescafe and similar things. It sounds ironic but the UK is no longer  ""classy"". I lived in Wolverhampton / Birmingham.

London? Seriously? Don't get it wrong, but it is a ghetto. Paint peeling from walls, litter on the streets, and nobody gives a damn. Even the famous Underground feels small, cramped, old, dirty, scratched... not classy at all.

I guess I could live in the Southwest like Exeter, Barnstaple etc. that place has some class left.

I am not deeply familiar with Germany, but I live since 2009 in Austria so I think I could live in Bavaria, it is a very similar place. Stuff is just good quality, everything from clean houses to good coffee. Up north or west it can get a bit puritan, and obssessive with orderliness, Swabians can be especially hard to live with, Stuttgart, Baden-Würtemberg, people say there can be some very critical neighbors.

Ho resistito un anno fra lavoretti e contratti (ho dovuto aprire la partita iva, che e' stato un massacro). Facevo la fame, se non letteralmente almeno metaforicamente. 

Poi mi sono stufato. Ho iniziato a far domanda all'estero, dopo due mesi ero in Inghilterra, con contratto di base non ricchissimo, ma dignitoso; abbastanza da mantenermi, e permettermi una vita 'normale'.

Mi ricordo il trauma del colloquio, che e' andato cosi': un botto di domande tecniche, poi un meeting con risorse umane. Dopo due giorni, mi hanno telefonato con un'offerta - e nessuno mi ha chiesto ne' chi mi mandava, ne' mi ha 'offerto' di lavorare gratis 'giusto per vedere come lavori'.

Quasi tutti i miei amici, quelli che si sono laureati con me, sono all'estero (lavoro in un campo.. non richiesto in Italia): Olanda, Germania, Austria, UK e, incredibile ma vero, Repubblica Ceca (che e' un posto spettacolare). 
  
E tutti quelli che sono ancora in Italia (per motivi di famiglia, o problemi a muoversi) stanno messi - lavorativamente parlando - molto male: un mia amica e' ricercatrice, e tra tagli e controtagli e' in piena depressione. Un altro amico lavora per una ditta toscana, che e' in chiusura: ora e' in cassa integrazione.

Sara' che siamo 'choosy', ma io penso che il problema sia un altro: e' inutile farsi il q*lo e cercare di essere bravi nel proprio lavoro, se tanto l'amico del cuggino peppe' ti fa le scarpe sempre e comunque. Nessuno e' motivato a far meglio, quindi tutto sprofonda sempre piu'..

About fairs, on May when exactly?

The biggest event right there is the ""Salto della Contessa"" a medieval reenactment that involves all the village, alas that takes place in August, but below there are some of the events I found searching around. They don't take place in Gavorrano, but they're not far from there.

1st May: ""Palio dei Ciuchi"" (donkeys race) in Montalcino-Sant'Angelo Scalo  

11 and 12 May: [""Festa del Prugnolo""](http://www.eventiesagre.it/Eventi_Feste/21036933_Festa+al+Prugnolo.html) in Montieri, the Prugnolo is a kind of mushroom. 

12 May: in Follonica costume reenactment of the visit of Granduke Leopold the II of Lorena and the Palio of Flags.

12 May: Pomarance-Montecerboli [""La merenda dei vignaioli""](http://www.turismo.intoscana.it/intoscana2/export/TurismoRT/sito-TurismoRT/Contenuti/Eventi/Sagre-fiere-e-spettacoli/visualizza_asset.html_587059572.html) (peasant's snacks) in Piazza Buozzi with wines, salami, soups and cheeses typical of that area.

26 May: [""Balestro del Grifalco""](http://www.massamarittima.info/folklore/girifalco.htm) Comune di Massa Marittima in Piazza del Duomo, medieval Crossbow competition that involves all the village in a tournament.

I’m originally from Scotland but have lived in the USA for the past 10 years, and I will admit there are some slight cultural differences. For instance, I used to smile at everyone I made eye contact with on the street and kind of nod my head at them. Here people just stare into your eyes and maintain eye contact. That was a little weird for me to get used to because at least where I lived in Texas people that kept staring at you probably had a problem with you/wanted to fight. 


I only speak Castellano, and while I’m not fluent by any means I know enough for life to be easy. A lot of people here appreciate that I speak Spanish (even though its not Catalan), because I think they assume that most Americans come here and want to speak English and have things like in America. Also a lot of people from Barcelona that I meet in my age group (I’m 23) get really excited that I speak English and always want to speak English with me so that they can practice theirs. 


I don’t really have any friends here but I still go out and I always meet really friendly people who talk to me and ask me about my time here. And they always seem to enjoy it when I tell them how much I love Barcelona, and how lucky I am to be here. I mean I’ve encountered the odd drunk asshole who yells shit at me in Spanish but that’s just 1 out of 100 people, and that doesn’t bother me. The same thing would happen in America. 


Barcelona has got to be one of the most diverse places that I have ever been, and while there might be a deep sense of nationalism I would say that it has never bordered on xenophobia. Barcelona is great mate, you’re going to love it.

I believe music festivals are by far the biggest and most well known festivals in germany.

Other festival like events I can think of:

- Karneval (this has a fixed date in February)
- Kirmes / Jahrmarkt (similar to a county fair, i guess)
- Mittelaltermarkt (Kind of a renaissance fair)
- Schützenfest (mostly in rural areas)
- Maker fair (not very common yet)

These are almost all rather smaller regional events. You normally wouldn't travel more than 20 - 50  km to visit one.

Some other events that might fall in a similar category are conferences and and exhibitions, like CeBit, Frankfurter Buchmesse, Chaos Communication Camp ... But these usually have a very specific topic, and are deadly boring for someone not interested in the subject.

It's not bad, its fucking terrible. 

As a Irish person you should realize your country's influence will be very limited compared to Germany's, France's or even Poland.

I will give you one small anecdote from sweden, it might seem pityful, but I can assure you that the same will happen to you, and in many different areas if we continue this path of more and more power to the EU.

In sweden, we have this thing called ""snus"", its tobacco you put under your lip. It's cancerous effects are none to small and it doesnt smell. 

So, basically, its a individual choice to use it, it doesnt affect anyone else. One of the biggest companies producing snus, have been talking to the EU about being allowed to sell snus on the EU market, because one of the critierias when we joined was that they couldn't (you know, free market and all that jazz).

Anyway, they go to the health commission in the EU and tell them why snus is better than cigarettes (which it is, by a long shot).. the commissioner (from Malta) sends a buddy of his, [to try to get a big bribe](http://www.thelocal.se/43982/20121023/#.UW6dSYImqIp) from the swedish company. The commissioner leaves his job because of this (no prison or anything, you know, you cant put these men in costumes in prison). 

So now you think, since the swedish company did soo good and didnt pay the bribe, they would be allowed to sell snus? No!

Instead, the EU gets a new health commissioner, a anti-gay, anti-abortion catholic which thinks women should stay at home from Malta (again, its so relevant to the EU project, and its always nice when people the furthest from you can decide over you). This guy, doesn't want sweden to be allowed to export snus, and he wants us to give him a roadmap of when we will stop selling snus nationally so we can go back to smoking (his cigarette-lobbyist buddies, no doubt).

Malta is a small island, no doubt both these people know each other well, it's obviously a case of where the first guy got caught with his hand in the cookie jar and when he couldnt get any cookies from the rich northerners his buddy will have to do the deed instead.

tl;dr: enjoy your new eu overlords.

Même ton truc du [Salon Beige](http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/peaks2.jpg) dit que ce sont les CRS qui ont repoussé les manifestants, ils n'ont donc pas poursuivi des fuyards pour les harceler ou quoi, ils ont *repoussé* des manifestants.

""Incest Alarm"" Good grief!  How about doing some research before publishing.    
Let me tell you, yet again, about *Íslendingabók*.  

Both births and deaths of all Icelanders have been recorded, along with the names of the mother and father, ever sine Iceland was settled.   

The database *Íslendingabók* contains this genealogical information about the inhabitants of Iceland, dating more than 1,200 years back.  
It is a collaboration project between *deCODE genetics*, a research company in the field of medical genetics, and Friðrik Skúlason, an anti-virus software entrepreneur.  
   
This database, covering the entire present day population and stretching back to the founding of the country along with medical data from more than 140,000 Icelandic volunteer participants, the genealogies, and high quality universal healthcare make possible very large-scale studies of virtually any common disease.  
   
This enables [deCode](http://www.decode.com/) to minimize the selection bias that confronts research in larger, more stratified populations, and enables them to impute or predict genotypes using the genealogies, multiplying many-fold the amount of data that can derive from genotyping and sequencing. Using this approach and resources, deCode has discovered major genetic risk factors for diseases ranging from cardiovascular disease to cancer.  

Here are links to some of deCode findings, that have been made possible thanks to Icelanders generous gift to medical research:

&gt;Come l’Argentina, l’Italia affronta infatti una crescente perdita di competitività dovuta a una moneta sopravvalutata, con rischio di caduta delle esportazioni e crescita del deficit di parte corrente. Il rallentamento della crescita peggiorerà deficit e debito pubblico e lo renderà potenzialmente insostenibile nel tempo. E se la svalutazione non può essere usata per ridurre i salari reali, la sopravvalutazione del tasso reale di cambio sarà annullata attraverso un lungo e penoso processo di deflazione di salari e prezzi. La deflazione, però, manterrà alti i tassi reali e renderà più acuta la crisi di crescita e di bilancio. Senza le necessarie riforme, il circolo vizioso della stagdeflazione imporrà all’Italia l’uscita dall’Unione monetaria, il ritorno alla lira e il ripudio del debito denominato in euro.

true,thatfool,null,null,"&gt; it's very important to examine the social systems within countries independently 

Well then let's do that.

Let's start with white supremacy. White supremacy does not exist in Germany in any shape or form that resembles white supremacy movements in the US. 98% or so of Germany's population is white; even though we have one of the largest migrant populations in the world with almost 20% immigrants + non-citizens and this is comparable to the US in terms of percentage of the population, almost 90% of our population is originally European. Our largest minority is ~5% Asians... but our Asians are mostly Turkish. 

In contrast, in the US, only ~65% of the population is non-hispanic white. There are states like Mississippi or Louisiana with 30-40% of the population identifying as African American. We don't have any minority this size anywhere in Germany, none of them have the same huge presence that the larger American minorities have in the US. We don't have the same residential segregation you can still find in the US as a result of its recent history. And unlike the US, Germany is in the middle of several European countries full of white people that look pretty much the same as white Germans. 

Instead, by and large, German racism is more about nationality than anything else; it's about Germans vs. foreigners, and neither is a distinct race by any stretch of the imagination. Because of this, Germans perceive German racism in a completely different way from US racism. You write that we're blind, and to some extent this is true. The US still having segregation in its laws in the 60ies is very obvious, and the large black and hispanic subcultures are very obvious. Neonazi groups we're not directly exposed to are not, neither are popular stereotypes used by a social group you don't associate with. In public, neo nazi groups often only advertise their nationalism.

There is an ongoing discussion about banning the National Democratic Party, which is pretty much the only real far right party we have. But if you read its manifesto, you will not find explicit racism in the sense that one ethnicity is superior to another. Their ideology is that every people needs to be protected, and its culture preserved, and their way to do that is nation states. Essentially, they want to define Germany as a German nation state in much the same way that Israel defines itself as a Jewish nation state. They also hold some other highly questionable beliefs that are just as incompatible with our Basic Law, and there's that thing with restoring the borders of 1937, but as far as racism goes, that's it. That's the largest neo nazi group we have, and it's basically some people stuck in the past who want a German nation state with traditional family values. 

One problem we have with recognizing racism is that our education is one-sided. We learn about Hitler and the Third Reich in school... every single year. I studied history for fun for a while after getting my first degree (thank you generous German education system), and it didn't stop then, either. We constantly hear about the Third Reich. It's not limited to schools. Germans love Hitler, we seem to enjoy re-iterating past events so we can convince ourselves that we're preventing ourselves from repeating old mistakes. But: It's almost exclusively about the Jews! If you ask your typical German what Hitler's biggest crime was, he'll tell you it was killing all those Jews. The result is that we tend to think that not hating Jews is the biggest part of not being racists/bigots/idiots, but not hating Jews is extremely easy for a German since there aren't too many around that could wrong you or even remind you of their existance. We have a comparatively tiny Jewish minority, but our biggest racism related debate is always about anti-semitism. There's a very influential Jewish Council representing about 100k people, and several Muslim ones that almost nobody knows exist even though they represent millions.

And now I need to stop talking about Jews, because I already feel my German indoctrination making me want to point out that there's of course nothing wrong with having a Jewish Council... so let's point out your mistakes instead to distract from mine. :P

One mistake you make is you misinterpret the ""far right"" label. In contemporary German culture, ""right wing"" alone has a negative connotation. In certain circles, calling someone ""right"" (""rechts"") can be worse than calling him a klansman. Our rightmost popular party (CDU) insists on being ""centre"". The term ""far right"" does not give anything any kind of legitimacy in Germany; it describes extreme nationalist, undemocratic, fascist and so on ideals and is understood in this way by Germans. It's also not an invention of the media, it's the official term used by the government to describe these groups. If you want to discredit an organisation or otherwise reduce its perceived legitimacy, the most efficient thing you can do is find ""rechte Tendenzen"" (""right tendencies"") among its membership and publicly accuse them of it. ""Right"" is sufficient; it doesn't have to be ""far right"".

Going back to cultural and social structures: German racism is almost exclusively limited to the poor, and non-poor Germans are not exposed to it nearly as much. Additionally, as a form of scapegoating, it's hard to get rid of. We're not going to get away with telling these people that they're responsible for their own lives; they've already chosen to not believe that. We can try to make them less poor, but being poor in Germany is already not that bad compared to most other developed countries. We can try to educate them more, but if that doesn't also make them more successful in life, they'll still look for scapegoats. Understanding this is critically important to understanding German racism. Half of the relevant crimes occur in Eastern Germany, even though that's only a relatively small part of the population. But it's the poorest part, and until 25 years ago they were effectively isolated from Western culture. Objectively, they are not as poor now as they were before the reunification, but now they know they're poor. 

There's also casual racism. That exists everywhere, but fortunately all it takes to fix is pointing it out every time you can. *Some* Germans will do things such as referring to Turks as ""Dönerfresser"" (people who eat Döner Kebap - if you know anything about German culture you'll realize that this term would more accurately describe *Germans*, but fuck logic) because we are, as you write, not sensibilized. There never was a big debate about racism in general (as opposed to anti-semitism) that could have taught us to know better, but since most of us aren't actually racists, pointing this out when we're sober can be much more helpful than you might think. 

That said, when you do that you might also want to add Americans to your list who refer to the French as cheese-eating surrender monkeys. Same thing. I would even expect that you'll have more success with Germans, because in my experience, Americans will refer to freedom of speech when you point out how reducing French military accomplishments to one attack they weren't prepared for doesn't make sense and isn't very polite. In contrast, Germans do *not* grow up with freedom of speech as a highest order value. We grow up with *balance* between our own personal rights and those of others as the main guiding principle, and we tend to understand that our own personal freedom cannot be more important than the personal freedom of others. 

You can see the same difference in how we treat symbols of previous iterations of our respective countries. Flying the flag of the Third Reich is illegal in Germany and, while that one is legal, you absolutely *cannot* fly the flag of Imperial Germany as a show of admiration for Bismarck. In contrast, flying the Confederate flag is freedom of speech in the US, and how it affects the victims of the ideals represented by it is simply not important because freedom. This is is racism, too.

I can also give you an example of racism in your comment I'm replying to. You write that your ""gut feeling has been that white people are actually more liable to fall under suspicion than black people are"". [Here's an interesting study](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20sommers.pdf). The authors argue that this belief is the result of black people gaining a perceived advantage as racism against blacks has been decreasing. In other words, it's an expression of a possibly subconscious belief that racial equality is bad for you as a white person because it subjectively puts you in a worse position than you were in before. That's racism.

It's also problematic to reduce racism in the US to things like a white supremacy movement or the fact you have this long on-going debate on a national level. You're omitting that there are still very obvious differences between ethnic groups in the US, both economic differences and differences in education. I don't know if you personally think like this, but it seems to be a very American thing to claim that the problem is solved because these groups now have the same legal status as everybody else, based on the American ideal that anyone can be anything if he works for it. Still, more than 50% of the black and hispanic population of the US drops out of high school and less than 10% achieves a college degree, while 25% of the white population achieves a college degree. On average, white Americans have 50% more income than black or hispanic Americans. White Americans own more homes, more cars, and more business equity. Having a black president does not negate any of this, and all of it is at least a result of racism.

You have a huge medieval market with lots of different things to spend far too much money on alongside with a wide variety of food stuffs. You can go into the Kaltenberger Schloss itself (which is in the center of the whole area) to get more common catering as well.

Additional to the pure market, there are lots of little show areas for all visitors, kids and adults the same. Throughout the day you can enjoy several small shows (magicians, combatants, the usual stuff you'd expect at a medieval market).

And then there's the Contest of course, the central show somewhen during the afternoon where specialized showmen do a roundabout two hours long tourney, always with some kind of ""good vs. evil"" backstory. The showmen are a french group that is coming there every year and they are really, really good. You got fights on foot (which are okay), some kind of story usually revolving around one bastardization of Arthus or another and then you got the horsefights which are pretty darn amazing and are dubbed the best there are.

O si arriva a una totale integrazione politico-economico-sociale dell'Europa e si va di fronte ai cittadini facendo il mea culpa e dicendo ""Scusate, avremmo dovuto farlo prima di avventurarci nell'euro, forse così vi avremmo risparmiato anni di sofferenze"", oppure finiamo di farci prendere in giro, usciamo dall'euro (non dall'Europa, ma dall'euro, ché a dirsi anti-euro c'è sempre gente che ti taccia di essere antieuropeo) in maniera calma e ben studiata e vediamo che succede.

- Tips : In france waitress are not paid with the tips, unlike in america tips still have the meaning of an extra payement for an extra service. If you assume the waitress don't do anything more than their job requiren, don't give tips. It's not rude at all, the waitress usually don't wait for tips and even if they ask you for one, you have the right and you need to refuse. (Some waitress will try to abuse the fact you don't know this thing since you're american)

- Friendship : French hate fake persons, don't try to act too friendly or too exited for nothing. French are not rude if you talk to them, it's a misunderstanding due to our difference in culture. If you start talking to someone and after one answer he goes away, it's because he don't feel like talking to you and he will not fake this fact. 
For me i it's more polite to avoid someone than fake a smile and act like i'm pleased to talk with him . But don't worry you're american, people will be interrested in you just because of that :)
In result of this, the french tends to stay in small groups of close friends they really know (usually 4-5) instead of hanging out with a large groups (10-15 peoples) in which they don't know everyone. So at first it will be hard to join one of this close group, but when you will finally join one, you will experience a different meaning of friendship.

- Love realtionship : In france we don't have different state for a relationship, you have one or you don't have one.

- Religion : Try to not talk about religion. Like i said before a french will never be agree with you because he wants to be gentle, if he disagree with you he will say so. Religion is an hard subject where nobody is agree with someone else, but we respect the religion opinion of everyone. So we can't be agree with you for your pleasure and we can't be disagree either since we don't want to be rude with your opinion. If you keep talking about religion, you will force the persons to say their opinion and most likely be rude with your own.. and it's not something they want to.

- Language : 99% of the young understand english, but less than 10% have the confidence to talk in english. So always try to speak in french, if you have problems, finish in english they will understand but ask to be answered in french if they don't feel like talking in english.

true,FrenchyDude,FRAN,France,"It's taking me all my will to not downvote you.. But I still won't, since I want the debate, and I want people to see this.                 
                   
Let's just forget that half of those numbers are caused by other people not accepting, and treating the child badly because of the stigma there is behind homosexuality, it's not what angers me the most here.                 
Please, if you are going to give us some ""data"", link to the real study, not some chart done by someone who wanted to show something.                 
Since you did not link to the real study, let me : www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12000610                  
You might quickly notice that nowhere in this study is the term ""lesbian mothers"" used, it's only in your table. ""LM (lesbian mother)"" does not mean the same thing, that S the person that made the chart in your link added makes it take a different meaning.                 
And I think the worst part (almost) is the use of ""married parents"", when the original study uses ""intact biological family"". If you go see the real study, you will find there are many other categories, such as ""adopted by strangers"", or ""step family"". Those can be married too. Why aren't your data sets adjusted to include those ?!..                  
Also, and the main reason why you should always find the real data, it is really easy to find a study with lots of numbers, and pick out the few to make it say anything you want.                  
&gt;Frequency of alcohol use	""intact bio family"" : 2.70	""LM"" :2.37              
                  
See ? I've made it say that when raised by his biological family, a child would use more alcohol than he would have if raised by a lesbian mother..                
                  
Just for the super lazy, I'll do a tl;dr of the conclusion of the original study, that you can find in the link I provided.                  

&gt;Do children need a married mother and father to turn out well as adults? No,                 

&gt;Although the findings reported herein may be explicable in part by a variety of forces uniquely problematic for child development in lesbian and gay families—including a lack of social support for parents, stress exposure resulting from persistent stigma, and modest or absent legal security for their parental and romantic relationship statuses—the empirical claim that no notable differences exist must go. While it is certainly accurate to affirm that sexual orientation or parental sexual behavior need have nothing to do with the ability to be a good, effective parent[...]                      
                   
So, the conclusion of the study is like little fucks like you who don't bother to do the research and think they know it all are the problem, by reinforcing the stigma that exists about lesbians and gay. I find it really sad that you managed to use a study showing gays can raise children to try to bash on gays raising children..                 
Sorry I got rude but you made me lost my temper.. I'll just end on a little sentence that I find appropriate..

&gt; **Yet, we have to recall that public debt in the EU has risen from around 60% of GDP before the crisis to around 90% of GDP. And** it is widely acknowledged, based on serious research, that when public debt levels rise about 90% they tend to have a negative economic dynamism, which translates into low growth for many years.”

His entire paper is a good read and quite optimistic. He underlines the improvement in public finances and the easing of market tensions following the reforms.

L'idée est que la France présente un risque systémique trop important (si on fait faillite, le système financier va s'écrouler ou en tout cas être énormément affecté), du coup il était supposé par les agents sur les marchés que la BCE ne laisserait jamais la France tomber, donc que la France est parfaitement sûre (d'où les taux bas) parce que si la France va trop loin dans le rouge, la BCE interviendra. 

Or, la BCE vient de laisser, ou a laissé mais ça vient d'être rendu public (je n'ai pas trop compris), qu'elle organisait un marché STEP (Short Term European Paper) qui permet à la Banque de France d'offrir du crédit (et offrir un crédit c'est créer de la monnaie, d'où le ""droit de battre monnaie"") au profit des banques françaises : les banques récupèrent des euros et déposent en garantie des obligations STEP à la Banque de France (titre qui permet le recouvrement de la créance). 

Seulement, la Banque de France transmet les risques associés à ces obligations à la BCE. Le but est d'empêcher les banques françaises qui sont vraiment dans le rouge de faire faillite, étant donné qu'on a quelques banques (BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, j'ai oublié les autres) qui présente des risques systémiques.

Donc, indirectement via la Banque de France, la BCE crée des euros pour les banques françaises et la France décide combien et à qui: la BCE ne peut absolument pas contrôler cette création de monnaie par le crédit.

Par contre je me demande si la Caisse des Dépots et Consignation est éligible à ce programme et si elle peut ouvrir des lignes de crédits à la Banque de France en échange d'obligations STEP, ce qui signifierait qu'on fait marcher la planche à billet.

C'est plutôt positif pour la France si ça marche, le risque c'est que si ça ne permet pas de stabiliser les banques françaises, on aura le même problème qu'avant (risque de nouvelle crise financière) mais avec des banques plus grosses.

Après, j'ai peut-être mal compris.

Thank you for your very specific descriptions of German society and laws. It's really cool to get more information!

I hope you'll pardon me; I'm quite a bit less ""politically correct"" in how I discuss my ideas, when I'm trying to puzzle out things in my mind as I write about the day to day development of my personal anthropological/sociological models, here on Reddit.  

I think I should begin with this: In recent years, I've been intrigued to discover the huge differences, culturally, from nation to nation... even between sibling countries such as Canada and the USA. I have concluded that these differences in sensibilities and values eclipse the differences between ethnic groups within any single country. People will sometimes complain that I'm reinforcing stereotypes when I talk about ""silliness in America,"" ""intelligence in Germany,"" ""rationalism in Canada,"" ""selfishness in the UK,"" or ""racism in Australia"" - but as I see the facts on the ground, there *are* quantitative differences in broad national sensibilities - some of which are positive and some negative. I could just as easily talk about the positives: ""the UK, with its wonderful sense of history,"" or ""caring, social-democratic Australia,"" for example.  The way people think about things and discuss issues together is fundamentally important from an anthropological standpoint, when it comes to understanding what makes a country tick. As we both seem to agree - those systems are unique, depending on the country we're looking at.

Last night after I posted what I said above, I watched a few more ZDF shows on my Ipad - and my models about what I was thinking about earlier developed a bit more. My sense is that: given that Germans are so intelligent, there are certain negative as well as positive consequences of that mindset and adeptness with ideas which show themselves across the breadth of German society from one corner to the other.

There was another episode of ""37 grad"" which examined the family situations of two female prostitutes. I was put off by the fact that one Bayreuth mother had refused to have any contact whatsoever with her adult daughter for 12 years because of that daughter's unique life choices. Of course, this can happen in religious families here in the USA, too... but when it does, it has a very different quality to it. Because Germans are so smart, there can be a tendency in some people toward a certain type of stubborn self-righteousness, and there can be a desire to manipulate even adult children in a way that wouldn't happen quite the same way in the USA. 

Another example of what could be considered a negative:
I watched a Wiso episode (a consumer watchdog program), last night and I realized that because of the level of intelligence in Germany, scam artists can be a lot harder to spot than they are, here in the USA.

Back to our topic, I get the sense that in central Europe generally (although maybe far less so in Germany) there is a sensibility that some ethnic groups and nations are better or worse (or less successful economically) than others because of their cultural values. There does seem to be a school of thought in the halls of European academia which supports this kind of nationalistic ideology. This seems to be behind the rhetoric of the Danish People's Party, for example... and it seems it was what has powered rhetoric in Switzerland in recent years, when it comes to the discussion of the banning of minarets. Certainly, this ideology propelled Anders Breivik to do what he did in Oslo and at Utøya Island. 

It's interesting to hear you say that ""right wing"" is kind of a slur in Germany. Again, I would volunteer my model that the hyper-intelligence of Germans might tend to create the opportunity for a certain small minority of Neo Nazis to become so stubborn in respect to their nationalistic ideas that they will even physically threaten and assault middle class white people who are arguing for the rights of Turks or other minority groups. The reason I point this out, is that white-on-white violence illustrates the dug-in nature of that group when it comes to how they choose to defend the values that they believe in.

Here in the USA, I'm happy to report that this brand of nationalism has waned a lot with the onset of this new century, and especially since the election of Barack Obama. I'm still waiting to see a first minority prime minister of the UK, and hopefully we'll see a German chancellor of color one of these years.

I apologize if it sounds like I'm ragging on Germany in this long post. Perhaps I should, actually, go on to talk about all the things I really admire in the country. I think it's a much nicer place to live than my own country - the USA. However, the topic on the table is about Neo Nazis and white supremacist groups, and there's certainly a lot of context just in discussing that topic that it's hard to make room in one ""wall of text"" for all the other stuff.",0,1366215352,null,0,1366216760,0,c9h29x9,t3_1chrrf,t1_c9h29x9,t1_c9gzeqh,null,1431525355,-1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,-1

true,thatfool,null,null,"&gt;  I get the sense that in central Europe generally (although maybe far less so in Germany) there is a sensibility that some ethnic groups and nations are better or worse (or less successful economically) than others because of their cultural values.

There is some truth to this. They didn't have Hitler, and as a result they're less reluctant to acknowledge their heritage, or generally be patriotic. I still remember huge debates about the permissibility of the German flag on your car during a soccer world cup. We seem to have accepted that as a normal thing to do now (it will still void your insurance), but it still can get you reactions such as [this](https://sosheimat.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/601823_315122081909484_1924361350_n.jpg).

&gt; There does seem to be a school of thought in the halls of European academia which supports this kind of nationalistic ideology. 

Nationalism in general is a comparatively young phenomenon. It didn't exist at all in Europe before the 19th century. But it did start with intellectuals and academia, and it obviously hasn't gone away yet. The background is important, though. 19th century nationalism wasn't about keeping people out of your country. It was a reaction to a long history of multi-national empires that had no real connection with their people. Germany itself is a product of this nationalism; the German Empire was an attempt at forming a nation state for Germans that replaced over twenty individual independent states. 

Then, WWII happened and we generally stopped thinking of this as a good thing. But that affected Germans *a lot* more than anyone else in Europe.

&gt; hopefully we'll see a German chancellor of color one of these years.

Our vice chancellor is Vietnamese if that counts for anything. Like I wrote previously, with less than 1% of the population being black, the biggest problem would be finding one who's willing to run.

Soit on veut créer des discussions et dans ce cas, il me semble qu'il faudrait encore davantage limiter le nombre d'articles soumis. &lt;5 discussions par jour ( peut-être un pour chaque média ). Ou voir même carrément considérer de faire des sujets type ""article de la semaine"" sur le /r/france mettant en scène l'article le plus marquant de la semaine selon des critères déterminés.

Après, il faut pas se leurrer, la communauté est relativement peu nombreuse et les défauts des commentaires de journaux viennent pour beaucoup du nombre des lecteurs.

If you ignore the very same markets you're borrowing money from with your fingers in your ears, then don't expect them to provide a low interest rate. 

The EU has borrowed money from the markets on a massive scale, and the ratings agencies are essentially sub-contractors of the market who are paid for their opinions. If you don't like the ratings agencies then don't deal with the people who pay the piper - the markets the EU has borrowed from.

Ad esempio mettiamo che io oggi decido di cucinare un pollo tandoori. Non ho mai cucinato questo pollo prima, nè l'ho mai assaggiato prima. Semplicemente cerco una ricetta con google e la eseguo al meglio che posso dopo essermi procurato il necessario. Alla fine ottengo una ""cosa"" e mi chiedo: è un pollo tandoori? è venuto bene?

così su due piedi mi viene da dire:

  * è meglio di un pollo più semplice, es. grigliato?
  * ti ha dato problemi di salute?
  * ci hai investito una quantità sproporzionata di risorse rispetto al solito?
  * lo rifaresti?
  * è come nelle foto?

Foreign policy..absolutely. Domestically? Well, she's hated but I think it's hard to argue she was wrong in terms of long term vision.

The industries she's blamed for ""destroying"" are typically things like mining(iron, coal, etc) that existed only by heavy subsidy. In the years since they were reduced, the Chinese have been competing at a rate almost no European country would be able to compete with.

Chinese miners make *today* what British miners wanted in the *1970s*, and with far fewer safety provisions. The industry - had she continued subsidizing it - would have been virtually extinct by now. The subsidies would have become unmanageable.

Britain would have invested billions into something that they would gain nothing from long term. The opportunity cost alone would be huge, never mind the direct subsides that could be applied elsewhere to things that would actually be around in 20 years.

Instead she turned around and provided training programs(which admittedly didn't take as well as they should have) to try to get people into the ""new"" economy (the service economy) that very much helped to resurrect Britain's failing power.

What she did was *very* bad in the short term - she essentially went after entire industries in one big swoop, fearing that she would lose if it became a series of smaller political fights over decades - and in doing so obliterated industry in some cities.

*But* her vision - where she thought the future was headed and what she thought Britain would/wouldn't be able to compete in - was spot on. She probably improved many more people's lives than she hurt, but she did it indirectly and years after she left power.

It's mostly domestically owned. There's only a couple international companies, and even then they're mostly just parent companies(aka they have a UK company paying UK taxes employing UK citizens)

[Severn Trent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_Trent) - Based in Coventry, no parent company. Domestically owned, domestically operated.

[Pennon Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennon_Group) - Based in Exeter, England. No parent company. Domestically owned, domestically operated.

[Kelda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelda_Group) - Based in Bradford, England. No parent company. Domestically owned, domestically operated.

**Foreign Owned, Domestic Operated**

[Kemble Water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemble_Water_Limited) - Australian

[Northumbrian water group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbrian_Water_Group) - Based in Durham with a parent company in HK (foreign owned, domestically operated)

[YTL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YTL_Corporation) - Malaysian owned, domestically operated.


**Publically Owned**

Both Ireland and Scotland still have publicly owned water supplies.

Seems like this is more a problem with subsidies(which Thatcher generally disliked as well). Be private or public, mixing the 2 is bad.

One of the best cities in Spain. ...I wrote this to someone on reddit, last year, she was coming to visit Granada and asked for some recommendations. I know you didn't ask for recommendations but hopefully this will get you excited and you'll want to live in Graná 
Please feel free to ask me any specific questions you might have! 

""Things I would recommend: 1)The Mirador de San Nicolas(everyone knows it, if you ask anyone they will point you in the right direction. BEAUTIFUL. It is in the Albyazin(the old arab quarter)) 2) The alhambra(of course) 3) Walking through the Sacromonte(The Gypsy quarter where people live in Caves that have been built into the mountains. BEAUTIFUL...there is also a cave museum there, which is a little touristy but interesting) The thing about Granada is, well, are, the Tapas. Supposedly, Tapas were created in Granada. ""Tapar"" literally means to cover. The story goes, there was this king who was drinking wine, but flys and other bugs kept getting in his wine, so, a servant covered the king's wine with a little plate. Anywho, this is how tapas go in Granada. In Any restaurant, and I mean ANY RESTAURANT, when you order a drink, be it, wine, beer, or soda(usually not water) the waiter will return with a little plate of food. ALWAYS. This my friend is the GEM of Granada, THE TAPA. The more drinks you order at the restaurant the bigger and more ornate the Tapa gets. You cannot request a certain tapa(you get what you get) so, I hope you can eat shellfish and ham and olives because, well, they love it here. My favorite place to get tapas, which is the most authentic place to get tapas in ALL of granada is called Los Diamantes. It is a TINY hole-in-wall place that is ALWAY PACKED with Spaniards. It is REALLY popular and truly, always packed with people. At this place you must order either wine or beer and the bar tender give you a tapa. It is SOOOOOO authentic and soooo Spanish. I really hope you get to go there. Los Diamantes on calle Navas.

The gist of it is this: with a fully functioning central bank you cannot default on debt that is issued in your currency. You just cannot. The fact that we in Europe are being saddled with an imaginary strait-jacket because of German inflation fears is what is driving austerity, which is destroying growth and societies. We could be spending money we don't have yet, if the ECB would pursue full employment (economic growth). We are in a systemically designed deflationary trap which benefits no one except the 1% (whatever you want to call it - a very tiny amount of people on this continent, in any case), and rating agencies are compounding this clusterfuck gleefully, because they see we lack the political means to change this. Markets love that national bonds are netting yields as high as they are now (7% in Slovenia, for example) even though nobody really believes that any country will be allowed either to default or to leave the Euro. Risk-free 7% loans enforced by the Troika, which will dismantle social safety nets faster than a Thatcher on steroids. They're just sucking all of us dry. It's crazy.  
And opinions such as expressed by scantron7 are precisely what is behind this political stalemate - nobody understands how modern money actually works, and we're all hurting because of it.

""All federal spending is simply changing numbers up in our bank accounts"" is just wrong.

Ultimately though sovereign debt is real, sovereign governments can default - although for a modern economy it would be a real cataclysm. 

The reason why debt auctions reach 7% is because nobody is willing to buy the debt at a lower price. There is plenty of money to buy that debt, but it's unwilling to do so because of the risk involved.

Le tue idee sono davvero confuse. Un generale non *segue* ordini. Un ufficiale generale, *impartisce* ordini. E gli ordini che ha impartito hanno portato alla morte di 30000 Etiopi e la deportazione di decine di migliaia.
Io mi rifiuto di *celebrare* con un monumento a lui titolato questa disumanità.

Rodolfo Graziani *non* è *caduto* in guerra. Ha vissuto benissimo. Una cosa sono i caduti in guerra, una cosa diversa un generale che ha autorizzato il massacro di decine di migliaia di persone e poi, tornato in Italia, è stato premiato con il titolo di Maresciallo d'Italia.

Non c'è nulla di male nel ricordare i propri morti. Sono assolutamente contrario a celebrare Rodolfo Graziani, Benito Mussolini ed ogni criminale di guerra.

true,Xuth,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; People wrote that in the UK they call armed back up when they have to. Why? What is the point in that? Wouldn't it be more effective if they could deal with it right ahead. 

Frankly because incidents of firearms related crime are so relatively low - even in urban areas. Where there are firearms, police will often use preemptive measures with the armed units. The number of times armed units are needed are too low to justify arming every officer. Because it's so difficult to get a gun in the UK most criminals simply don't use them - only the really high profile stuff. At major events like the Olympics or at key locations in central London (especially during a high terror alert) then there are armed officers walking the streets. They're usually equipped with MP5s. 

&gt;Also a police man with a gun has more authority. Looks scarier. Which is good so that no people pull off some stupid shit.

That is a valid point, but in the UK we have the principle of 'policing by consent' - the notion that the force owes its primary duty to the public, rather than to the state, as in other countries. So they shouldn't, in most people's eyes, have the ability to walk around with guns if the general public do not. They are *our* protection. At least that's the founding theory anyway.

When Robert Peel formed the London Metropolitan Police back in 19th century (our first police force) there was a very strong fear of the military at the time - the masses feared the new force would be oppressive.

A force that did not routinely carry firearms - and wore blue rather than red (something which was associated with the infantry) - was part of this effort to distinguish the early ""Peelers"" from the Army.

Over time, this notion of guns being inimical to community policing solidified - the Police were respected for their community connections and other means of dealing with situations. 

I should say, however, that this situation works, perhaps uniquely, here in the UK and Ireland. In other countries I would say that armed police are certainly a good thing.",0,1366227019,null,0,false,0,c9h6x8l,t3_1cjedp,t1_c9h6x8l,t1_c9h51dm,null,1431523165,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

A global marketplace returned to a gold standard system effectively stabilizes the money supply.  It used to work this way.  If you look closely at 20 franc gold coins, same weight as Swiss, Begian, Tunisian.  Roughly the gold content of coins was easily converted into all world currencies.

Inflation is simply where more currency is needed in order to purchase the same ""worth"".

For example if the demand for apples is greater than supply - let's say apples become very fashionable, and apple trees are affected by a new mutated fungus strain - then the price of apples will rise. If you measure inflation solely on the price of apples you'll mistakenly think that there has been inflation.

However in the same example if everybody bought apples costing £1 and someone created a whole batch of fake £1 coins, then inflation would result because there was now a whole lot more money around. 

Giant conglomerates are competition and if Goldman Sachs is seen to be buying sovereign debt at a big profit margin then someone else will buy it for a shade less. I don't work in investment - I am linked to it because I obtain my funding from a pot of money which would be used to buy debt.

We'll need Eurobonds in the future. That was my original point. Re-read my first comment, again. Nowhere did I write that it should be established now.

If they implement eurobonds now. If the situation cools down, it won't. Or won't go up that much.

Yes, if they don't want interest rates to go up. I thought this was a given?

Then Spain can move on from just cheap cars and tourism, so that Spain's economy doesn't crash every time just because it has a strong currency(many car companies have increased production in Spain as a result of wage moderation and increased productivity, so progress is being made on that front). Blaming the euro/Germany/the north etc for all of Spain's troubles is just cheap scapegoating.

Assuming people had 100 to spend on 100 apples, and suddenly they had 200... then the price of apples would quickly become £2. Quick enough that economics doesn't account for the time it takes.

The inflation wasn't the price going up. It was the extra 100 in the market. The apple seller now has 200 to spend, rather than 100. So he buys an extra loaf of bread, an extra joint of beef and an extra keg of beer. So the next day the price of all of those items has gone up just a little bit because of the extra demand from the apple seller, because of the extra 100 he had. 

Or what if he didn't put the price up. He sold all of his apples for £1, and the people who buy apples still had £100 left between them. They might go and spend their money on beef, beer and bread and the increased demand would push the price of them up.

Leading on from those the baker, butcher and brewer would then have extra money in their pocket because of the price going up...

And after a few cycles it would be clear that there were still 100 apples being sold, still 5 kegs of beer and 20 joints of beef and 40 loaves, but the price of all of them had gone up. That's inflation. Not because the prices going up, but because the value of the currency has gone down - the prices going up is just a symptom and it's a common way to measure it.

Non hai ragione. Certo che anche lui riceveva ordini-da Mussolini. E Mussolini ha detto che vuole Etiopia. Rodolfo doveva conqustare Etiopia. Per Mussolini le vite di queste persone non avevano nessuna significanza. Per l'Italia delle camicie nere le vite umane non contavano. Rodolfo faceva quello che era obligato a fare. Nota che io non ho mai detto che dobbiamo celebrare le facende di Graziani, di Emilio de Bono e di tutti altri fascisti italiani, tedeschi ecc. Dobbiamo accettare il fatto, pero, che la guerra e parte della nostra societa' umana. E con la guerra tante persone innocente soffrono. Il numero che noi(italiani) abbiamo ucciso non e' significante. 30 000 persono sono pochi. I tedeschi hanno ucciso circa 50 millioni. 60 con i morti tedeschi.

Sei sicuro che ha vissuto benissimo? Io posso immaginare come era odiato. Come il popolo al quale ha servito(anche se seguendo idee sbagliate)lo odiava. E' andato anche in prigione vero?

Ogni nazione europea ha il suo macellaio. I serbi hanno Ratko Mladic. Succede. Ci sono anche malvaggi italiani. Non possiamo essere tutti perfetti.

Ti chiedo una domanda. Un giorno il governo ti manda una lettera. Devi andare nell'esercito. Ma sei confuso- vedi, l'economia lavora l'Italia sta diventando un paese forte. Gli altri paesi europei hanno gia un po di rispetto e non ci prendono in giro(come hanno fatto dopo la Prima Guerra Mondiale). Ti mandano in Africa. Viene il comandante. E dice che prendi la carta bianca. Fai quello che vuoi. Devi ammazargli. Tu sei cresciuto in un'Italia nazionalista e anche razzista. Tu credi che tu sei parte del popolo supremo. Perche questo lo hai sentito tutta la tua vita. Da quando sei un bimbo. E questo giorno la patria chiama-"" Amazza gli etiopi"". E tu lo fai. Non e la cosa giusta. Ma puoi immaginare quello che succede nella testa del soldato giovane? Ogni storia ha due punti di vista. Non puoi dire sempre chi ha ragione. Non sei stato la. Non sai tu cosa farei. Non puoi parlarmi del ragazzo. Givane, bello. Lui e' in Russia. Pero e' un uomo grande. Non ha scarpe. E la Russia e' fredda. E lui uccide perche altrimenti muore dal freddo. Questo l'ho letto. Della lettera di un soldato. Che non c'e' piu. 

Certo-erano bestie, assassini. E' facile giudicare.

I monumenti si fanno perche il popolo deve ricordarsi. Non sono smpre fatti per celebrare. Hai mai visto la colonna di Traiano? Hai mai visto le statue di Cesare? Cesare ha ucciso tante persone.

true,Halk,SCOT,Scotland,"Hmm. I don't know that he does make a good point - other than what I've acknowledged already.

Paragraph 1 and 2 of what he says are just platitudes.

Paragraph 3 is what I disagree with.

Paragraph 4 is more platitudes.

The direct quote in blue... he's not wrong but the people's feelings are wrong. The EU does need to worry about the dry technical concerns. The people need to understand that if the markets lose faith in a country then that country has a spiralling problem. I'd like him to explain that yes the people are right that empathy isn't being shown, and that the MEPs need to explain themselves to the people - although I think they've tried to, but the media isn't interested in those explanations - at least in the UK they aren't.

Paragraph 5 I don't know what he's trying to say - or what the Journal are saying he's trying to say

Paragraph 6,7,8 he's right - but again he's not saying anything. It's just more platitudes and pandering.

You're not going to get a politician that stands up and says ""Who cares about unemployment, stuff the women and stuff the public.""

Anybody and everybody can show sympathy/empathy if there's nothing else being done.

So I disregard the paragraphs in the article which are just platitudes and I'm left with 3 paragraphs.

1) (Paragraph 3) The EU needs to understand the ratings agencies are hurting the people, and are unelected

2) (Direct quote) The EU hasn't cared enough for the people but instead has cared about the ratings agencies and markets

3) (Paragraph 5) 
&gt;The Irish President said that, in relation to issues like unemployment, the European Union cannot afford to place its singular trust in a version of a logistical, economic theory whose assumptions are “questionable and indifferent” to social consequences.

From context my guess is that he's saying the EU cannot trust in what the ratings agencies or markets say, they should instead care about the people - which in my opinion is a false dichotomy because by making sure the markets do not lose faith you do care about the people and you do try to limit unemployment.",0,1366230399,null,0,false,0,c9h8bfp,t3_1cixg4,t1_c9h8bfp,t1_c9h80ef,null,1431522507,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
