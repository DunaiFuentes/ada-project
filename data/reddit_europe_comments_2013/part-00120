Haha! There's a reason we call them TLAs (Three Letter Agencies) :)

I agree that Homeland Security seems redundant. But each agency has a different mission, different responsibilities, and, more importantly, different rights. Keep in mind, the US was founded on a principle of limited government. The reason the FBI, CIA, and NSA are separate (at least in the case of FBI vs CIA/NSA) is that the CIA and NSA are forbidden from operating against US citizens at home. Since the CIA/NSA have limited military powers, there is an idea that the government should never use military powers domestically. I can get behind that idea.

Let's get started with the obvious ones: 

* Machi (Μάχη): It's run by those who staged the coup in 1974. 
* Alitheia (Αλήθεια): It's the mouthpiece of the ultra-conservative fraction of the Christian Democrats-equivalent (DISY, ΔΗΣΥ). Expect racism, homophobia, reproduction of the party's political line.
*Haravgi (Χαραυγή): It's the mouthpiece of the communist party (AKEL - ΑΚΕΛ). Expect the same as above. 

Then in the slightly-less-bad area, you have:

* Fileleftheros (Φιλελεύθερος): It's often presented as being centrist, but they have a very clear leaning for the rejectionist party (DIKO - ΔΗΚΟ) and they often run factually wrong stories, even in non political issues (eg, few weeks ago they run an article on how condoms are bad!)

* Simerini (Σημερινή): This is the libertarian fraction of DISY's mouthpiece. They are a bit less racist and homophobic, but not too much because DISY must stay united and have a single voice blah blah. They have especially bad opinion pieces that reek of conspiracy theories that involve nationalism. 

* Politis (Πολίτης):  They were better 2 years ago. They were the only paper to focus on social issues etc. Not anymore. They became some sort of ""yellow press"" which sensationalist articles and factual errors. And full of badly translated foreign articles. 

So, what remains? Cyprus Mail is okay.

I can understand that these states which actually pay into the system are annoyed if they see that their money is often wasted as it is happening now at Berlins new airport.

But I am pretty much fed up that a former state of farmers that got subsidized with a shit ton of money since the end of WW2 is now screaming the loudest.

Besides the fact that e.g. Berlin has been the heart and brain of the electronic industry in Germany until the end of war and all major companies just moved their money and headquarters to states occupied by the western powers it should be noted that the GDR paid reperations to the sovjets not just with money and end products but also with their factories.
You can't even call it paying since it was more like theft when factories got demounted not just once but even twice or thrice and moved to the Sovjet Union.

And now the profiteers of the Marshall Plan, other subsidies, the escape of companies from the east to the west, blame the robbed and poor states of the east.

And I am not saying that the eastern states are doing everything right...but if there are no headquarters in your state or whole branches of industries you can't really make any money by taxes/save money via low unemployment rates.

examples like the solar industry in Freiberg/Saxony or the computer chip industry in Dresden prove me right but sadly these are rare exceptions.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"Nations can be built over differ ideas. America is special in that you came from somewhere else and now you're there -- ""The American Dream"" -- but Finland isn't built around that. We've been here a very long time. I usually hesitate to speak of the following because patriotic stuff looks rather inane or even insane in written context shown to outsiders, but I'll try to be somewhat understandable.

Americans might look at their flag or their constitution and think that honouring those two is what makes you American. I've often noted that people in the States start talking of 1779 like history started then, even though New York and Boston had been around for centuries by that time. Because before the constitution was written, there were no American people, only foreign people on American soil. Those two items - constitution and flag - is what define you, I think. It's what made you. You may correct me if you want to. 

Finnish people isn't like that. There's no single flag, single constitution or single object that makes us what we are. No single point before which we were something else. As far as written history goes, we've always been here. We've been under several administrations over the years. Divided by borders in the middle of our tribal lands, strange flags put up and ordered around by foreign lords who suddenly decide that our ancestral lands now belong to the crown. Historically, there are no ancient Finnish kings (we're so north that upkeeping an army to stop rebellions doesn't work), only tribal leaders, and they didn't really do that well together. There's no Robert the Bruce, no Charlemagne, no Rurik. There isn't even any ancient glory days like what Italy and Greece have. The only things that really unites us is the language and some shared believes on how world works and what's man's place in it (and those we pretty much share with the Scandinavian countries). 

And I've lived extensively in foreign countries. I can do well; I know the customs, I speak the language. I've made friends etc. But getting back home here and speaking the language of my thoughts and seeing that the other person shares my unspoken ideas on what's proper way of doing things is incredibly relaxing. It's like being family, even though you don't know each other.

And no, language is not just a thing you talk to other people. Language is also the way you share culture. For example, in the first half of 20th century very few people in Finland spoke English, but many spoke German and Swedish. So all the new ideas we got came from those countries. When we looked for examples on how to write our laws, how to structure our nation, we looked at those countries because we could understand what they were doing. Today, most speak English but very few speak German. Thus when doing research or talking politics, earlier examples are often sought in Anglo-Saxon countries, even if culturally more apt examples could be found from Estonia or Sweden. In Finnish political conversation when talking of immigration, the examples are often taken from Britain, even though Sweden would be better example. With copyright, we are looking examples from USA even though Germany has the same legislation system. And so on. 

Languages affect how ideas spread. Not historian, but I don't think it's only due to Soviet armies why the Iron Curtain fell at the border of Slavic language group. So the border of language is often also the border of ideas. Like what's proper way of doing thing, should television only be entertainment or should it be part of cultural integration etc.

TL;DR: Saying that Finland would be Finland even without Finnish language is like saying Iowa would still be Iowa with communist constitution, another flag and another history.",0,1371287047,null,0,false,0,cajc3ky,t3_1gbu7b,t1_cajc3ky,t1_caj1cxy,null,1435558421,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You tend to forget that a lot of people who worked in ERT, have started in private networks, and a lot of the formats like Reportaz xwris synora apperead in private network in the late 90's, when ERT was still showing dragoflies mating from those 70s documentaries.Only after the retooling of the public TV during the 2000-2005 era we got modern shows.But these have vanished from the private networks by then because they are costly, and not much of a money maker (and dont start about legal issues when traveling abroad in places like Africa).Things where even worse when the Internet become mainsteam.So again it as a parochial,expensive,overbloated system in TV channel, a bussiness who doent provide essential services and it had to stop.

P.S.
You do realize shows like Mixani tou xronou will probablycome back right?Ert is not gone forever...

Realize that together we have a marginal lead over the U.S. and that we can end the fragmentation that allows individual European countries to have irresistible pressure applied to them on a case by case basis.  EU is still the largest single economic entity on the planet.

Many anti-EU advocates forget how obedient European countries are to U.S. whims, and how if you want real democratic representation your government actually needs to be capable of protecting your own interests vs. those of mega-corporations abroad.   EU in its current structure is still very susceptible to US lobbying efforts, needs to change quickly and permanently.

Changing trains at Munich is required, but RJ 260, the first train of the day from Vienna, misses the first connection by minutes. As there are no real other options from Munich, I may have to take the ridiculously slow, but direct route to Frankfurt via Nürnberg, where I can change to a TGV to Paris Est. The whole TEN 17 turns out useless in my case, as there are no fitting services. 

The very benefit of this connection would be additional connections and the total travel time cut by 1/3. At them moment, the total travel time from Frankfurt to London is 7 hours, mainly due to waiting times at Brussels. According to Die Zeit, the direct connection would take between [4 and 5 hours](http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/2010-09/ice-london-bahn). Not only would this make travelling easier, it would also allow additional indirect connections as the last train of the day can depart later and can be reached easier from other places.

Let's imagine that Roman people (as a collective) are a body. This body, is partly on fire. Quite a large part of this body is on fire. The fire represents the Roma who tend to cause problems like stealing and being assholes. However, only *part* of the body is on fire. Once you start generalising and saying ""Roma are bad/whatever"" you immediately generalise about the part of the body which is not on fire and isn't causing problems and does everything ok. That part of the body might be a minority, it might be very small, but you're still over simplifying. And when you over simplify like that, you start judging people you've never met and then you start to make decisions based on that prejudgement. You make decisions based on this person who you've never met, based on something that this person cannot control (their ethnicity). So, in effect, you start hurting this person based on those premises. You might not be hurting them directly. But you are hurting them indirectly. Your racist opinions will effect the government who will then make life difficult for these people based on things out of these people's control. Not only that, but you will influence other people who will make the same decision as you which will effect the government and those people who you effect might also actually meet a Roma. They might meet a Roma at a job interview and then decide not to hire this Roma and grant him a way out of poverty because he is of a Roma, which is something he cannot control. This poor guy who's lived in some ghetto all his life, this guy who is perfectly qualified for the job being turned down because of racism. Where do you think this person who cannot get employed goes? He steals. He becomes tainted by society. He becomes the asshole we all hate.

It was replaced with treatment/monitoring outside of institutions, the idea being that institutional confinement reduced the likelihood of successful reintegration in the future.

Whenever a crime is commited by an immigrant, it is written in the newspapers (and it makes it to the national newspapers/television), but when a crime is not commited by an immigrant, nothing is said about it. 

I remember a couple of months ago, on the television they told about a robbery somewhere. The only reason it was mentioned was, that it was commited by an immigrant. Because, at the same time, the local snack bar was robbed by four men with a gun, who threatened to shoot the owner's baby. They were filmed by several cameras, but the televion program prefered not to mention it anyways. 

I saw the story on a local newspaper's website. Nationality was never mentioned, and in the comments, people wrote that the four tall men with local accents were actually immigrants faking those accents, in order to blame 'real' Dutch people.

Same for other stories. When immigrants bully gay people out of their home, it makes it to the national newspapers for weeks and the major is criticized heavily, but when non-immigrants do exactly the same in a neighbouring city, it gets two lines on page 5 of the newspaper.

And people are stupid. Incredibly stupid. Fucking racists everywhere who assume that newspapers do it the other way around. Like, a couple of weeks ago there was a news story about a guy who robbed a bus with a knife. In the comments, people wrote how the media were hiding his 'true nationality' from us by not mentioning a thing about it. However, two hours earlier the newspaper had already written an article about it which mentioned he was not an immigrant.

true,poupipou,MPyrenees,Midi-Pyrénées,"&gt; Je ne connais par la théorie du genre

Cet article n'a pas eu l'effet escompté : tu n'étais plus censé dire ""théorie du genre"" mais études du genre ;) Je suis loin d'être une spécialiste mais je vais essayer de répondre à ton message en fonction de ce que j'ai compris des études du genre (si un spécialiste passe par là, j'accepte toutes les corrections !).

Il ne s'agit pas de ""grouper les constructions sociales en genres"" mais d'étudier dans quelle mesure le genre d'un individu est un construit social. Il y a d'autres constructions sociales (par exemple la nationalité : on n'est pas naturellement ou génétiquement français), mais elles sont étudiées par d'autres branches de la sociologie. Les études du genre se penchent sur les facteurs sociaux qui font qu'un individu s'identifie/est identifié comme masculin ou féminin. Un autre intérêt de ses études est de questionner nos définitions même de la féminité et de la masculinité, et de leur attributs : pourquoi le foot est-il considéré comme un sport de mecs et l'équitation un sport de fille ?

&gt; Si toutefois on pouvait grouper les constructions sociales en deux genres, femme et homme, je serais bien curieux de savoir quelles sont les définitions de ces deux genres. En fait, je redouterais surtout qu'elles soient calquées sur les stéréotypes pré-existant sur le genre biologique.

Justement !!  Ce que tu appelles ""genre biologique"", c'est ce qu'on définit ici comme sexe biologique. Et la plupart de ces ""stéréotypes pré-existant"", c'est ce qu'on appelle ici le genre. L'intérêt des études de genre, c'est de faire le distinguo, ce que ne font pas certains opposants, s'appuyant souvent sur la biologie et ""l'ordre naturel"" en disant ""les femmes sont comme ceux-ci"", ""les hommes sont comme cela"", sans prendre en compte les facteurs sociaux. Manque-t-il vraiment un gène aux femmes qui font qu'elles n'ont pas le sens de l'orientation ? Ou est-ce parce que dès l'enfance les jeux des petits garçons leur font plus travailler leur gestion de l'espace ?

&gt; Je ne vois pas du tout où est le problème de considérer que le genre est exclusivement biologique, tant qu'on sait que le genre n'a rien à voir avec la personnalité.

Au final j'ai l'impression que tu es d'accord avec les principes des études de genre, mais pas avec les termes utilisés. Ce que dans la phrase que je viens de citer tu appelles le genre, on l'appelle ici le sexe, et la personnalité, le genre. Et les partisans des études de genre souhaitent mettre en avant cette distinction afin que justement beaucoup de comportements attribués à un genre soient plus considérés comme de simples préférences et traits de personnalité. Pour reprendre ton exemple, les études de genre montrent que la jeune fille qui s'intéresse au skate n'est pas un garçon manqué, n'en est pas plus ou moins une femme (et donc que l'attribution du skate au genre masculin n'est qu'un construit social) mais seulement une fille qui aime le skateboard.",0,1371308092,null,0,false,0,cajf2hi,t3_1geckm,t1_cajf2hi,t1_cajehy4,null,1430800937,-1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,-1

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt;That means there have been a lot of rapes. It doesn't mean they are frequent or common. It just means they happened.

Because the phrase ""a lot of"" is hyperbole and completely unspecific. Whilst ""frequent"" and ""common"" are also a form of hyperbole (even in this context) but mean something slightly different. 

""A lot of"" means "" a lot of"", but it is not relative to anything. To me, 1,000 orange is ""a lot of oranges"". But 1,000 oranges is not so much when compared to, for example, 10,000 oranges or 100,000 oranges. However, to me, having 1,000 oranges is just an inherently big amount. But if I compare it to other things, it isn't quite so big. Sorry it's kind of nuanced English language thing.

To get more specific: There could be one rape a day. That is a lot of raping, in my opinion. However, when compared to a population of, for example, 10 million people it no longer feels like quite so many. The reason for this is because, although the overall number of rapes is 'a lot' it is not 'a lot' when compared to the entire population of Sweden. 

Conclusion: In (insert country here) there is a lot of rape, but rape is not common or frequent. 

Perhaps someone will come and critique my use of English, but I've explained what I meant even if it was not the best way to explain it initially and I hope you understand now. 

&gt;I know that Sweden claims it has a broader legal definition of rape

I think broader legal definition is a bit of an understatement when we're talking about international rankings and compare one country to another. 

I'd like to explain it for any laymen or women reading. 

In most countries, they count a rape as every *individual* who has committed the crime of rape. They do not count for how many times she/he raped the victim. However, in Sweden they count the actual number of times the victim was raped. For instance, there are five rapes counted per 100,000 in Romania, where as if that had happened in Sweden it could easily be counted as 63 rapes. 

For instance, a substantial amount of rapists like to lock their victims up somewhere or other and 'keep them' to be 'reused'. Depending on how long they are kept, the victim could easily be raped hundreds of times before the criminal is captured or the victim killed. This means one rapist in Romania only counts as ""one"" in international rankings, where as one rapist in Sweden can easily make it into double digits. 

Furthermore, I've never heard anything good about the Romanian police force and I would be skeptical of how many rapes actually go reported, compared to how many are reported in the media in Sweden.

I would also keep in mind that Romanian news companies might not think that rape is a particularly important thing to be reporting on, so they don't. Where as news companies in Sweden do and will report every single rape they can find. News is not necessarily representational nor, even, are statistics.

&gt;You are trying to explain something by confusing the shit out of anyone. It's actually more simple than that: ""There are A LOT of rapes"" is actually relative to something. It's relative to all the other rape statistics in Europe. How did you go about assuming it's not relative to anything?

Well I'm sorry you don't understand English as well as I do. I've used the exact same phrase to other native English speakers and it's perfectly comprehensible, and even quite informative. Like I said, it's a nuance. I didn't think to dumb down my language before writing, as if it comes naturally. 

Also, you seem to be trying to simplify this down. Some things should not be simplified and this is one of them. Don't try and make some 

Rape in Sweden = bad

Rape in Romania = good 

comparison. It's not that simple. Two countries can very rarely be held up against each other and then make a simple comparison. 

&gt;And of course, the criticism towards Romania will come, because of course, we have a lot of pocket theives, so we might as well have higher crime than anyone else, rape one another and the police is there just for shows.

Fine, maybe I'm being too harsh on Romania. I also think you're being too soft, but we can meet somewhere in the middle. I do genuinely think that rape is under reported in all the countries mentioned. I think it is under reported in all countries, including Sweden. I just think Sweden and other Scandinavian countries are marginally better at reporting it (to the authorities) than other countries like Romania, Poland, ect. 

Additionally, I have all my other points about how the media does not represent things evenly and that Sweden counts rape differently. You yourself stated that there is difference in the way rape is defined and counted. 

You've got to admit, there's *a lot* of potential factors which could make Sweden seem bloated in terms of its rape statistics. ",0,1371322098,null,0,false,0,cajit3g,t3_1gd6z6,t1_cajit3g,t1_cajimno,null,1430799176,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;ERT is not paid by the central government budget; there is a license fee that people pay, which is about 3 euros per month.

Those 3€ don't fall from heaven, they come out of the pocket of every taxpayer. So this is a good thing, it's more money for the people of Greece and less to be wasted on a TV station that paid high wages to his executives and had a bloated staff.

&gt;The company has been in surplus for the past 2 years too, so, if anything, it is contributing to the government budget with what's left from those 3 euros people pay. 

A state-company in surplus doesn't justify it, the goal of the state isn't to turn a profit but to keep the country running.

State-capitalism has never worked, here in Portugal we also have state-owned and private-owned TV stations and the state-owned keep on presenting losses while the private ones do the exact same service and yet have good results and don't require taxpayers' money.

Besides, there are already plenty of TV stations in Greece, and ERT can remain in business if it gets privatised, you know, the know-how and the studios won't go up in flames. Even the state can keep part of its revenue as it will pay taxes.

&gt;If your argument is that the idea of public broadcasting is not worth 3 euros per month per household, that's a different discussion.

Privatise and then instead of it being mandatory, it will be optional.

&gt;Da un punto di vista più generale, uno studio del 2006 condotto da ricercatori italiani[198] e volto ad indagare tutti i possibili impatti ambientali derivanti da diete vegetariane e non-vegetariane, ha riscontrato che, rispetto ad una dieta vegana, una dieta latto-ovo-vegetariana ha un impatto 1,8 volte superiore e una dieta a base di cibi animali 2,7 volte superiore, in riferimento a modelli alimentari formulati con parametri dietetici equilibrati e quindi in via teorica, per quanto riguarda i risultati ottenuti dai ricercatori per la dieta a base di cibi animali tipicamente condotta da un italiano medio, questa risulta invece avere un impatto 6,7 volte maggiore rispetto ad una dieta vegana

No, there's plenty of human enterprises that shouldn't be profit-driven, you have courts, the police, firefighters, the food bank, homeless shelters, groups against addictions, among many examples that are not and should not be done for profit.

Besides, if the people do want cultural programmes, they'll watch those voluntarily and there won't be any such need to the government to spend money on those, let the people who want those things spend their own money and not the money of the neighbour.

Anyway, no reason to have a state-owned TV station.

Here's what you can do after the government privatises it:

1) As a costumer, send them mails suggesting them to don't show Turkish soap operas and tell them you'd rather watch culturally relevant programs.

2) As a citizen, encourage your friends and family to do the same. You can even create facebook groups and whatnot to make sure they keep their current programming and don't turn into bad TV.

I'm absolutely sure that, if done with enough people, they'll listen and do just that. After all, you won't be dealing with bureaucrats, they'll do what they think will be most profitable and if they think that they'll get a lot of viewers from that, they'll certainly do what you want.

Alternatively, try to buy some of it. Shares, bonds, anything. The managers have to listen to their creditors. If you get together with like-minded people, I'm sure you can end up detaining a considerable part of their capital and therefore have an input over what airs on it.

Immigrants are poorer because they are less educated. Those questions are related. According to my research education in Sweden is free for both citizens and non-citizens. So if they wanted to be educated nothing would stop them-I mean it is free. Money wouldn't be a problem. If they were educated they wouldn't be as poor. That is their problem-Swedes got them free education-they just have to use it. They obviously don't.

Probably because they are less educated? And if you are saying that people of two races with the same education have different job opportunities I think you should prove it. I don't buy that for a minute until you provide some trust worthy source.

People think quite differently across the continent by EU member states and numerous other factors:

1.  Between regions within EU countries
2.  Cities, urban and rural
3.  Privileged vs impoverished
4.  Educated vs unskilled labor
5.  Eastern vs Western countries (Warsaw Pact vs liberal democracy)
6.  Between discrepancies in natural resources
7.  Ethnicity, culture, and customs
8.  Orthodox vs Catholic
9.  Technological adoption rates


The EU cannot 'unite' as one.  However, the member states can immensely benefit from nearby location, free transportation, joint interest in defense, interlocking trade, and standardized policies and legal framework.


This subreddit in no aspect proves Europeans are not different at all.  This subreddit is well moderated (racists and nationalists).  It is low in representation of Slavic countries and the communication takes place entirely in English.

Per andare più sul pratico, la maggior parte delle comunità si autotassa per aiutare le famiglie più bisognose e spesso i ragazzini più grandi babysitterano o aiutano nei compiti i propri fratelli o i bambini di altre famiglie come momento di ""servizio"". Inoltre le famiglie a volte, a spese della comunità, possono andare all'estero ad evngelizzare luoghi in via di sviluppo, e parte tutta la famiglia. L'idea è che la vita quotidiana del nucleo che vive seconod Cristo debba servire da esempio, la parte primaria dell'evangelizzazione.

true,realwizardry,UKGB,United Kingdom,"You've stumped me slightly as the United States would never willingly accept a loss of power unless it collapses just as the USSR did, but I'll still try to theorise how the United States would dissolve its influence and what it would mean for both itself and Europe.

So the special relationship is severed, and the UK is now acting completely independently and in its own sole interests. Intelligence links are toned down. Classified information is kept classified to each individual country. This includes classified information about terrorists, and other threats.

The UK is no longer at such a danger as it is now, as it is no longer a good ally with the US. I mentioned previously that troops would be pulled out of the Middle East completely. There would no longer be any motivation by Al-Qaeda to attack our country. The only terrorist threats would be from lone wolves, whom the UK intelligence can easily keep a track of even without the illegal methods US agents employ.

Let's say that the US reacts to this in a negative way - they need to keep track of our citizenry just in case a suspected terrorist resides in our country just as the 9/11 hijackers resided in Germany for a brief time. They will need to share their relevant intelligence which clearly points out the alleged terrorist and clearly designates how they suspect he is a terrorist if they want to continue an operation in the UK. Our intelligence agents will then help them, if they abide to our rules. They must abide if they want to follow the suspect - the threat of being thrown out and losing a suspect will keep them on track.

But what if they break our rules, we cancel the operation, the United States is attacked and it's the guy they had been following in the UK? Of course, a major diplomatic incident would ensue. But we'll tell them that they did not follow our practices in our own country, which is not an American client state; that is the hard-line stance we'll take. The US will grow further agitated, and threaten war if we do not allow them to use our own intelligence with the freedom they had beforehand. We'll refuse.

War will break out, they'll land a few nukes at us, we'll nuke them back with our submarines but it won't be enough to return the damage and what is left of the UK is conquered by American forces. The mere idea of a NATO-less Europe is shot down and the rest of Europe keeps quiet lest they get annihilated by the same great fist that shook the British Isles.

I tried to cover all bases with the scenarios, and you'll note how it gets worse each time. Considering how the US would want to preserve its reputation, it wouldn't *actually* nuke and conquer another country much beloved by its own citizenry. I cannot say how the US would react to a severing of the Special Relationship because that is an absolutely unprecedented idea and because it's 1am currently.

Outside of the difficult quagmire regarding the Special Relationship, let's say that the proposal is put forward for NATO to be dissolved.

* **America requests for a new pact in return which preserves their bases (military, air, missiles, etc) on European soil so they still hold strategic positioning.**

Accept as a compromise, but with a tax on imported goods so it still provides a benefit. If America ever gets attacked by Russia or another non-EU nation (far-fetched, but let's accept all possibilities), they can attack the aggressor through any routes they wish and it would be up to each individual nations if they would like to join the US. They will not be forced by treaty.

* **America denies the proposal completely and refuses to sign it.**

Establish better trading relationships with upstart superpowers Brazil and India so we can survive a hit to our economies with a limited US trade relationship. Put forward the proposal again. If they refuse it again, threaten to impose an embargo which would greatly hurt their economy (sounds laughable now, but as a united continent we would be as powerful as the US).

Mira toda la gente,

Mira toda la gente,
pasean relucientes en sus coches de acero refulgente
y con sus caras de papel

No hagas más preguntas de las que hay que contestar
Esta noche veremos, mucha, mucha felicidad.

Y el policia asoma la barbilla en el bar
Está dispuesto a tomar un trago más
Mira a toda la gente, que miran indulgente con sus caras
impacientes mientras pasas, mientras tratas de pensar.

Desaparece, anuncia otro caso que olvidar, con la calle siempre serás un memo más

Mira toda la gente,
camina sonriente sin querer saber.
No hagas más preguntas,
no vaya a ser que te contesten.

That is a completely ridiculous thing to say. People like Al-Qaeda will continue to target the UK *no matter what the UK does*. First of all, homegrown Islamists born and raised in the UK can and will be seduced by rhetoric about the ""anti-Islamic"" nature of the UK government because it allows gay marriage or because there's a Jew in the Cabinet or whatever stupid reason the Islamists will come up with. Second of all, al-Qaeda-like Islamists in the Arab world think that Britain (and/or the US) ""gave Palestine to the Jews,"" and nothing Britain does now can correct that misconception. They will never forgive or forget that. Third of all, in the interest of international relations, Britain will continue to maintain friendly relations with the Gulf Arab states. Al-Qaeda and other Islamists hate the Saudis (and the other Gulf states) and consider them decadent and corrupt. Working British relations with the Saudis and other Gulf states, no matter how muted, will always continue to affront the Islamists.

There is no foreign policy that Britain can take whose result would be that ""there would no longer be any motivation by Al-Qaeda to attack [Britain]."" None. Thinking as much is naive.

*Buenas, estoy haciendo un estudio sobre las diferencias en la dinamica familiar entre España y Taiwan. Seria un buen favor si los redditors españoles en este sub me ayudaran y llenaran las siguiente preguntas, gracias! *

La Educación Familiar

I.

a. Cuando tienes una decisión grande que hacer (educación, viajes, etc.), la hace tus padres o ellos respetan tu decisión? **La decisión la tomo yo y si no dependo de ellos para llevarla a cabo la respetan o como mucho tratan de convencerme**

b. Cuando tienes algunas dudas en la vida (escuela, relaciones interpersonales, etc.), te dicen tus padres cómo resolver el problema o prefieren que busques la solución sólo? **Normalmente trato de resolver el problema por mi mismo, pero siempre están dispuestos a ayudarme a resolver el problema**

c. ¿Intervienen tus abuelos cuando tus padres te dan la disciplina? d. ¿Se enojan tus padres al ver tus abuelos sobre-protegiéndote? **Desgraciadamente solo he conocido una abuela, pero por lo que yo sé, lo normal es que los abuelos sean más protectores que los padres y estos suelen enojarse por no dejarles criar a sus hijos como creen que es correcto.
**
II.

a. ¿Es evidente la diferencia de estado entre tú y tus padres? (En Taiwán, generalmente, los hijos deben obedecer a los padres, es como si los padres fueran los jefes.) **Para mí mis padres merecen respeto como cualquier otra persona, la obediencia no está ligada al respeto y lo normal aquí es que los padres manden lo que creen que es mejor para sus hijos, no caprichos sobre como han de llevar sus vidas**

b. ¿Cómo es la relación entre tú y tus padres? Descríbela.** Es una relación abierta en la que podemos hablar de cualquier cosa, ellos tienen claro que vivo mi vida como considero más oportuno pero siempre tratan de que haga lo que ellos creen es lo mejor. Somos iguales con la diferencia de que ellos ya tienen su vida resuelta**

III.

a. ¿Cuáles son la expectativas de tus padres sobre ti? **Que acabe los estudios para poder vivir con un salario, de mi mismo. Nunca han expresado deseos de que me case o les de nietos, no es que no quieran, pero nunca lo han expresado**

b. ¿Crees que tus padres quieran que tú cuides de ellos en el futuro? (En Taiwán, los hijos suelen cuidar/criar a los padres cuando ya tengan trabajo.) **Mis padres todavía no necesitan ese tipo de ayuda, pero creo que ellos no esperan que cuide de ellos cuando llegue el momento**

IV.

a. ¿Te gusta la educación que te ha dado tus padres? Menciona algunas ventajas y desventajas. **Si, me han dado una educación sin ningún tipo de limitación, he podido elegir que quería estudiar de la misma forma en que nunca han tratado de condicionar mis inclinaciones religiosas o sexuales. No encuentro desventaja alguna**

b. ¿Educarías a tus hijos de la misma manera que te educaron tus padres? ¿Qué cambiarías de esta educación? **Si, quizás estaría más atento para trata de ayudar a elegir que tipo de estudios realizar**

V.

a. ¿Estás de acuerdo a en contra de la educación familiar de Taiwán, que suele ser más estricta? **Si, creo que un buen profesional se forma si está agusto con su profesión, forzar al estudio puede ser contraproducente**

b. Si estás en un restuarante y te das cuenta de que la familia asiática sentada en la mesa de al lado está regañando a sus hijos, ¿cuál sería tu reacción? Lo normal sería no hacerles mucho caso, a no ser que estuviesen armando un escándalo, llegado el caso podría llegar a tratar de intervenir, pero sería algo bastante extremo

Every country has ignorant nationalists and people who might be generally reasonable but have a few misguided ideas or who differ from you in how they want to do things due to cultural differences.

European history has shown that every time a European nation reaches a level of power and influence even close to where the US is today, it acts like it is drunk on nationalism, thinks it is superior and deserves to be privileged, and generally behaves in ways that are just as entitled and patriotic as the most nationalistic Americans.  Maybe WWII changed Europe in this respect, and maybe it didn't.  We'll see what happens if Europe successfully unifies and becomes more economically stable and militarily self-sufficient.

Ils commencent leur narration en 1905 mais oublient de mentionner l'épisode [Mosaddeq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Mosaddeq). Un président élu, démcorate et laïc, mais qui a eu le mauvais gout d'être socialiste et de nationaliser le pétrole en 1951. La CIA et le MI6 l'ont renversé un an plus tard (ce n'est pas une théorie de conspiro-zozo, c'est l'histoire officielle reconnue par tous les pays concernés) pour y mettre un dictateur à leur botte : le Shah d'Iran, qui sera renversé par les religieux en 79.

Donc les narrations comme quoi c'est finalement assez naturel que l'Iran sorte petit à petit d'une période inquisitoriale parce que, après tout, ils sont bien en retard par rapport à nous qui en sommes sorti il y a longtemps, ça commence à bien faire. Ce ne sont pas les soubresauts d'une théocratie historique auxquels on assiste mais aux conséquences de l'ingérence américaine qui a préféré mettre en place dans plusieurs pays des dictateurs vassaux plutôt que de laisser des démocraties pencher trop à gauche.

Indeed, it is all honestly very confusing to me. It seems as though you think you can pick and choose what the Samaras government will do. You think that if someone claims to do things in the name of fighting corruption that automatically makes everything they do against corruption? I mean, there's things in ERT you like and things in ERT you don't like and here's a politician doing undemocratic things promising he's doing it all for a cause you support.

Communism itself is by definition a stateless society. Talking about a communist state is as paradoxical as talking about a capitalist society without property rights.

You are painfully ignorant of socialist thought, which means you should entertain reading about it in order to judge it objectively rather than parrot unimaginative propaganda and make a mockery of yourself to any fundamentally knowledgable individual.

Socialism is relevant with the abolition of private ""absentee"" property and its substitution with collective property while maintaining all personal property rights. It is -in other words- relevant with the co-ownership and co-management of productive property by its workers *themselves*. It is about the workers owning the means of production and sharing their profit in shares equal to their labor. A state owning productive property and giving a wage to the workers is still by definition private property not intrinsiclly different than when any other institution owns something it doesn't itself use by proxy of its workers who are robbed of a fraction of the wealth they are producing. You literally can't have a society that both maintains dependent employment and is socialist as well. At the same time whether the market is or isn't regulated is irrelevant with that society being socialist, just like it's irrelevant with a society being capitalist. 

As an example of how off-target you are, mutualists are socialists but they also believe in an unregulated market and no state, while fascists (stricto sensu) are capitalists who intervene in and regulate the market in favor of specific individuals.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"Trade is completely different since then.  Global, mass communication, easy transport.  1850 was the Age of Empire.  Even before then in the 1812 war Britain realised the dynamic was changing.   It was in the 1920s that the British Empire realised that the future was in Commonwealth, recognising countries as equals based on trade.

1850s UK trade was still very much based on protectionism.  Even with the industrial revolution the UK realised that strength didn't come from servitude (although it would take some time) but in technology replacing the slave, and trade replacing dominance.  This is seen in the response to the 1776 Declaration of Independence in the US, and their support of Canadian nationalism in 1812.  That was a start, but by the 1920s they were holding Commonwealth Conferences instead of Imperial Conferences.  The emphasis had already moved from Imperial Protectionism, to allied recognition based primarily on trade.

Trade Agreements are needed in the modern world because now we commerce, converse and move, globally, in the space of seconds to hours.  Not months or years.  Faster travel and communication calls for faster trade.  

But more importantly, gone should be the days of protectionism among friends.  The argument is that the EU, through the EU states expanding their borders, is freedom.  It is not.  It is protectionism and redefining a border in reaction to emerging economies

The consistent approach would be not to try and form a Supranational state, much like the emerging UK had done by creating an empire, or taking sovereignty from others, but to see what the British Empire did when it effectively dissolved itself in the 1920s and pushed towards a Commonwealth, empowering sovereignty of others.  Not based on any national supremacy, but by actually acknowledging others as equals and   that the future should be around trade.

-------------------

I notice you're Portuguese.  When the issue of Cyprus broke I advocated the UK standing in and offering Cyprus the choice to rejoin the UK which it only recently declared independence from.  Not as some Imperial agenda. To allow them a way to stablise, use the pound as a half way house to leaving the Euro, maintain their own governmet, with a sunset clause of around 20 years when they could opt for full independence again.  In return the UK should get licensing rights on Cypriot oil fields but would have to bring Turkey to the negotiation table for a long term territorial resolution.

The argument has also been made that the UK leaving the EU would open a flood gate.  This in itself should be controlled.  I would argue that under Lisbon exiting countries would still be privy to the EEA and European trade.  We should do a controlled exit, possibly with Sweden if they wish, and whilst the UK can't carry everyone and people already in the Euro are somewhat tied in, a controlled exit could well include countries wanting to leave the Euro like Cyprus, Malta - and Portugal.  If the political impetus was there the UK could take the Cypriot issue with the Euro out of the equation with a snap of its fingers.  It couldn't do that with Portugal.  Portugal would have to devalue on leaving the Euro and take some pain.  The UK could however offset much of that pain without hurting itself.  It could effectively make for a cushioned landing by working with it as an equal, independent, but a trade partner under a Commonwealth agreement..

It's a question of scale.  But whilst the UK regaining a right to negotiate trade agreements with the Anglosphere, it could offset the initial disruption for Portugal, and whilst obviously bigger than the other states I mentioned, it could come into the Commonwealth as an equal but bring trade with it the likes of Brazil.

Germany and the UK can't solve all the EUs ills and bail everyone out. There are other major economies of course; but Spain is in trouble, France is facing institutionalised trouble.  Italy is in trouble.  There are other strong countries relative to their size, but in terms of size and strength that's it.  Sweden is strong and stable on one scale but not another.  Poland is strong on another scale, but it's not in the same league yet.

true,Gerspan,null,null,"I disagree with the greater part of your post, but I'm not really interested in discussing it (I have already posted one too many times about the cultural merits and structural limitations of ERT).

Instead I'll focus on this a bit.

&gt;Nothing is ""out of hand""

Ok. Let's examine the situation calmly and conclude whether this is the case.

&gt;The prime-minister (leader of the executive branch) published an executive order of legislation which closed down the public television network, without immediately substituting it with another public television network, and without consulting the other two governing parties which declared their disagreement with the action immediately after being informed of it. Additionally he mentioned that the order will be submitted to the parliament in three months.

According to article 44 # 1 of the Constitution, the President can publish an executive order of legislation under the explicit substantive condition of the presence of an **absolutely unpredictable state of exceptional emergency**  after the also explicit normative condition that it was **propositioned by the council of the ministers**.

In this case not only was the order not even remotely relevant with any sort of emergency, let alone an exceptional and otherwise absolutely unpredictable emergency, it was also propositioned to the President not by the council of ministers, but by the prime-minister alone, while certain of the ministers and in fact the leaders of the other governing parties *were not even informed about it*. 

Taking the above under consideration we must conclude that this is a flagrant violation of article 44 as none of its restrictive -due to the nature of the executive order as a last-resort measure in cases where the perpetual existence of the state is jeopardised and there is no time for a normative law to be voted on- conditions were met.

At the same time the fact the governing parties seem to have not beein informed and are otherwise expressing their disagreement with the action raises the additional issue of the violation of the separation of powers. It is clear that merely part of the executive branch has legislated without following the constitutional process and completely bypassing the parliament. Since he didn't follow the aforementioned conditions, it is clear that he legislated in obvious infringement of article 26 for the separation of powers as well.

He also mentioned that the -essentially null and void executive order of legislation- will be brought to the parliament to be approved in 3 months. This is also a violation of article 44 # 1 of the constitution which explicitly commands that an EOL (a constitutional one, even) must be brought before the parliament in *at most 40 days after it was published*. it's the parliament that has 3 months from the time it was published to approve it, but it must be brought before it in the aforementioned time-frame to be processed by the representatives.

Additionally, the expressed discontent of as much as 60% of the public with the action undertaken by the government reveals a violation of the fundamental principle of representativeness. Granted this can't be evaluated by the judicial branch courtesy of the aforementioned separation of powers, but it is nevertheless a substantially unconstitutional action, albeit he is only politically responsible for that. The elected representatives do not receive , however, a carte blanche to act however they wish in the name of the general public. They must at any time respect the principle of representativeness and represent the actual wants and demands of the general public.

Moving on, closing down the TV network in order to reconstruct it and the consequent firing of all of its 2500 workers, instead of reconstructing it without closing it and firing only the workers who do not have the necessary credentials, or whose organic position is no longer necessary, is a violation of articles 103 and 25 #1 of the constitution. It is clear that this was neither the necessary way to achieve the desired end (I already gave an example of a more clement way to achieve the same end) and either way violates the principle of proportionality stricto sensu, since the benefit for the state is lesser than the cost for the workers who lost their jobs and are left in a precarious state regarding their re-hiring.

A mass firing of civil servants, including those that are still necessary may also be considered to pose a violation of article 106 of the constitution.

Finally, closing down the television network without *immediately substituting it with another public network that can achieve at least the same cultural results*, let alone the chance that the new television network isn't public, is a direct infringement of article 15#2 of the constitution, that mandates that television must always be under the direct supervision of the state (which necessitates according to the absolutely acceptable theory and jurisprudence the existence of a public network) in order to equally promote cultural , humanist values and the arts. The chance that it might be replaced in the future doesn't alter the fact that this constitutional right is currently being infringed in its core.

So what we have is a government that legislates unconstitutional laws while bypassing the parliament which for all intents and purposes could just as well not exist for the past year or so. What else could possibly happen that could qualify as ""things getting out of hand"" for you? 

We already have an executive body legislating in the place of the legislative branch while disregarding the constitution. Things are way beyond ""out of hand"".

&gt; Privilégiant la construction sociale du genre sur l'inné et le biologique, la queer theory est la cible de vives critiques. Ainsi, d'après l'étude de la théorie par le sociologue Adam Green, professeur à l'Université de Toronto, la théorie queer nie l'« urgence sociale » dans certains cas (positions des sujets homosexuels) tout en récupérant cette « urgence sociale » dans d'autres (positions des opposants radicalisés).

**Épistémologie et méthodologie se limitant au discours**
&gt; Du fait de son engagement dans la déconstruction, il est presque impossible à la théorie queer de parler d'un sujet « lesbien » ou « gay », puisque toutes les catégories sociales sont dénaturées et réduites au discours. Ainsi, la théorie queer ne peut pas examiner les subjectivités, mais seulement les discours. Par conséquent, la sociologie et la théorie queer sont considérés comme inconciliables tant d'un point de vue méthodologique qu'épistémologique.

**Biais de ces théoriciens à la fois idéologique et de classe**
&gt; L'un des principaux thème de la théorie queer engage le sujet via une épistémologie sociologique classique qui conçoit des positions de sujets constitués par des systèmes de stratification et une organisation autour de l'expérience et de l'identité partagée. Une critique récurrente est que la théorie queer, qui a généralement recours à un jargon très technique, est qu'elle est écrite par une petite élite idéologiquement orientée et qu'elle possède un biais de classe sociale évident.

**Acceptation de la sexualité pédophile**
&gt; Une critique morale est également portée contre la théorie queer qui refuse toute référence à des idées standards de normalité et faire des distinctions considérées comme cruciales d'un point de vue étique. Par exemple, d'après la théoricienne du queer Camille Paglia, le terme « queer » inclut les transsexuels, sadomasochistes, et d'autres sexualités marginalisées, mais aussi les paraphilies (comme la pédophilie) considérées comme tout autant légitimes.",0,1371367423,null,0,false,0,cajuy07,t3_1geckm,t1_cajuy07,t3_1geckm,null,1430793372,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

true,TheoRim,null,null,"La théorie du genre est souvent dualiste et anti-scientifique, et pour ça elle se pose comme étant autre chose qu'une théorie, elle se pose comme un fait social. Mais si elle est traitée d'un point de vue scientifique, s'il y a quelque chose comme le genre, et s'il existe dans la société, ce n'est pas une construction sociale mais un type de comportement et c'est démontrable en psychologie. Hors, jusqu'ici, je n'ai pas l'impression qu'il y ait quelque étude qui montre que les gens sortent des catégories définies par le spectre de la sexologie, à savoir qu'ils entrent tous dans les catégories qui vont d'hétérosexuel à homosexuel. Il ne s'agit pas de cases, mais de spectre, et ça, ça compte, parce que l'étude des comportements humains essaye justement d'avoir d'étudier sous une couture suffisamment ouverte pour comprendre les fameux ""hors-case"". Hors-case, certes, hors-spectre, jamais.

Il faut bien voir une chose, tout de même. La théorie du genre n'apporte rien. Elle n'apporte rien aux militants, ni aux gens en général d'un point de vue épistémique. Elle fausse le débat. Elle est fausse d'un point de vue psychologique, parce qu'il y a des différences génétiques et développementales qui ont un fort impact sur le comportement ; et cela n'a rien à voir avec les fonctions de haut niveau. Mais quand même. Les hormones diffusées dans le cerveau des femmes et des hommes ne sont pas les mêmes ; et ils ont un impact sur le cerveau, et à partir de là il faut définir où, comment, à quel point. Mais qu'il y ait des comportements sexuels qui varient n'est pas un problème politique ou moral, quand bien même ce sont des déterminations génétiques, épigénétique ou bien développementales, ou même encore liées à l'apprentissage ou la culture. Tout ce la ne change rien au combat politique. Les théoriciens du genre ont voulu croire qu'avoir des théories subversives les aideraient à combattre contre les conservateurs ; ça a peut-être été vrai, mais il faut se rendre à l'évidence que la définition d'un comportement sexuel d'un point de vue scientifique n'a RIEN A VOIR avec la définition d'une norme en politique. Les différences de structure du cerveau et les différences fonctionnelles qui en découlent sont nombreuses, et les différences sexuelles ont un impact qui est du même ordre que les différences de personnalité entre personnes du même sexe. Il n'y a pas besoin de théorie du genre pour défendre le droit des minorités sexuelles et des minorités tout court, et quand je dis minorité je dis : groupes oppressés, parce qu'il n'y a pas besoin de statuer sur l'égalité biologique des gens pour souhaiter l'égalité des droits, et ça, parce que les différences biologiques entre chaque personne sont suffisamment nombreuses pour que si l'on statue d'une forme de droit naturel à partir de la biologie, il y ait de l'oppression à tout va, sur la base de l'eugénisme typique des positivistes type XIXème. Mais si on regarde les différences entre individus, et qu'on constate qu'elles sont tellement nombreuses, et bien ce qu'on peut souhaiter c'est qu'on norme sur autre chose que ça, à savoir, sur autre chose que les différences qu'on constate. Ce serait absurde et ça pénaliserait la majorité de la population. Mais l'inverse est vrai aussi. Être lyssenkiste est une absurdité, et la théorie du genre est super efficace quand il s'agit d'être lyssenkiste. Hors cela donne des choses étonnantes :

http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer

Il est prouvé à bien des égards, et l'ensemble des preuves balaie de manière générale l'idée que nous sortons par la culture des pressions évolutionnaires. Bien au contraire, les psychologues qui traitent de la culture mettent en évidence que les mécanismes utilisés pour les processus culturels sont entièrement hérités de l'évolution, et recyclés pour traiter des informations qui n'existaient pas dans le cadre où il n'y avait pas d'artefact culturel. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuronal_Recycling_Hypothesis

Cela reste à prouver quant aux comportements sexuels ; soit qu'ils ne sont pas simplement drivés par ce qu'on a hérité de l'évolution, qu'on a un ensemble de comportements qui sont hérités d'un changement de l'organisation neurale lié au contexte culturel, et non pas à des pressions évolutionnaire. C'est possible, mais il faut le montrer.

Et dans tous les cas, le genre ne peut simplement pas avoir zéro rapport avec les déterminations biologiques, parce que rien en nous n'a zéro rapport avec les déterminations biologiques. Alors, débattre de ce que sont les sources de la division du genre, de l'homosexualité ou du transsexualisme, ou même de l'asexualisme, c'est un travail de psychologue expérimental avant d'être un travail de philosophe ou même de sociologue. Qu'il y ait des comportements sexuels hérités, je ne sais, d'un phénomène culturel, pourquoi pas, mais il faut le montrer avant de l'étudier comme s'il existait. Pour qu'un sociologue soit juste d'un point de vue scientifique, il faut au moins que le phénomène dont il parle ait été identifié en psychologie, sinon ça ne fait aucun sens. Comment un phénomène social peut-il n'avoir simplement aucun rapport avec le comportement des gens qui le composent ?

Sinon, si on veut faire comme les gender studies, il faut montrer qu'il y a des phénomènes culturels qui sont littéralement indépendant de la psychologie humaine et de l'organisation du cerveau humain, et, jusqu'ici, ça n'a jamais été fait, et probablement ne sera jamais fait, parce qu'il semble bien que notre esprit colle invasivement à notre cerveau.

Habe mir mal das ""[Gesetz über den Nachrichtendienst](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bndg/index.html)"" angesehn. Das richtet sich oft nach dem ""[Bundesverfassungsschutzgesetz](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bverfschg/BJNR029700990.html)"". Ansonsten ist alles recht knapp gefasst. 

&gt; Der Bundesnachrichtendienst sammelt zur Gewinnung von Erkenntnissen über das Ausland, die von außen-** und sicherheitspolitischer** Bedeutung für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland sind, die erforderlichen Informationen und wertet sie aus.



§ 2 Befugnisse

&gt;(1) Der Bundesnachrichtendienst darf die erforderlichen Informationen einschließlich personenbezogener Daten erheben, verarbeiten und nutzen, soweit nicht die anzuwendenden Bestimmungen des Bundesdatenschutzgesetzes oder besondere Regelungen in diesem Gesetz entgegenstehen,
&gt;
&gt;1. zum Schutz seiner Mitarbeiter, Einrichtungen, Gegenstände und Quellen gegen sicherheitsgefährdende oder geheimdienstliche Tätigkeiten,
&gt;2. für die Sicherheitsüberprüfung von Personen, die für ihn tätig sind oder tätig werden sollen,
&gt;3. für die Überprüfung der für die Aufgabenerfüllung notwendigen Nachrichtenzugänge und
&gt;4. über Vorgänge im Ausland, die von außen- und sicherheitspolitischer Bedeutung für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland sind, wenn sie nur auf diese Weise zu erlangen sind und für ihre Erhebung keine andere Behörde zuständig ist.

Das alles schliesst auch die Überwachung im Inland nicht aus. Selbst der Datenschutz ist realtiv:

&gt; § 11 Geltung des Bundesdatenschutzgesetzes
Bei der Erfüllung der Aufgaben des Bundesnachrichtendienstes finden § 3 Abs. 2 und 8 Satz 1, § 4 Abs. 2 und 3, §§ 4b und 4c sowie §§ 10 und 13 bis 20 des Bundesdatenschutzgesetzes keine Anwendung.

Ich glaube bei solch groben Formulierungen ist die Frage ob die Überwachung der Kommunikation zwischen zwei Deutschen die über einen ausländischen Server geht legal ist, ist eher eine Frage des Auftrags. Wie schammig solche Aufträge formuliert werden sehen wir ja in den USA. Wenn der Bedarf nach Überwachung diverser Gruppen von Menschen im Sinne des Auftrags relevant ist, wird er wahrscheinlich einfach genehmigt. Wie will man den sagen, dass die Überwachung im Inland NICHT notwendig wäre um das Inland zu schützen wenn die Gefahr von Aussen kommt und mit jemandem im Inland kommuniziert? 

Zur Abteilung ""Technische Aufklärung"" schreiben sie auf ihrer [Seite](http://www.bnd.bund.de/DE/Einblicke/Aufbauorganisation/TA/ta_node.html): 

&gt;Die Abteilung Technische Aufklärung (TA) betreibt Informationsgewinnung mit technischen Mitteln (SIGINT).
&gt;
&gt;Dabei werden nachrichtendienstlich relevante Erkenntnisse **über das Ausland** durch gezielte Filterung der internationalen Kommunikationsströme gewonnen. Bestimmende Kriterien sind der Informationsbedarf der Bundesregierung sowie die Unterstützung der Bundeswehr.
&gt;
&gt;Die technische Aufklärung nachrichtendienstlich relevanter Kommunikation erfolgt in einem aufwändigen Verfahren unter ständiger juristischer Kontrolle. Dabei kommen bei Bedarf auch komplexe kryptologische Verfahren zum Einsatz.

Ich hoffe in den nächsten Tagen äußert sich mal einer der Webanwälte dazu. 

Edit: Der [heise-Artikel](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Spiegel-BND-weitet-Internet-Ueberwachung-aus-1889298.html) ist informativer. Das [G10-Gesetz](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/g10_2001/BJNR125410001.html) ist wohl eher interessant hierbei.

Unter anderem § 5 Voraussetzungen: 

&gt;(2) Bei Beschränkungen von Telekommunikationsbeziehungen darf der Bundesnachrichtendienst nur Suchbegriffe verwenden, die zur Aufklärung von Sachverhalten über den in der Anordnung bezeichneten Gefahrenbereich bestimmt und geeignet sind. Es dürfen keine Suchbegriffe verwendet werden, die

&gt;1. Identifizierungsmerkmale enthalten, die zu einer gezielten Erfassung bestimmter Telekommunikationsanschlüsse führen, oder
2. den Kernbereich der privaten Lebensgestaltung betreffen.

&gt;Dies gilt nicht für Telekommunikationsanschlüsse im Ausland, sofern ausgeschlossen werden kann, dass Anschlüsse, deren Inhaber oder regelmäßige Nutzer deutsche Staatsangehörige sind, gezielt erfasst werden.

Ist mir alles zu hoch irgendwie... Was ist ein Telekommunikationsanschluss? Regelmäßige Nutzer wäre ja schon fast ein K.O.-Kriterium oder?

A friend's parents live there. I'd recommend that aside from the largest port town of Mahon and the quaint little white washed village of Binibequer I'd look to find some of the nicer beaches in the North-East of the island.

If you're lucky enough to have a boat to get around (we used a jet ski!) you can get to some very secluded places - there is a beach famous for it's red clay that you can mix with water into a paste and spread over your skin which leaves it very soft. There is also the beach of the owner of Swarovski where you can horse ride to, or just soak up the sun on the golden sands.

There are places to rock dive on little islands just off the shore and beaches that others can't get to without boats!

I'm afraid I don't have directions to get to all of these places but if you show any of that list to a local of the island they will know exactly how to direct you.

true,Maromi,PORT,Portugal,"I understand the temptation to use a common ""enemy"" to unify europe, but the long term results of such a policy aren't very good; as soon as the ""enemy"" vanishes there is no motive for unification.

As several people mentioned, the way to go about it is to provide positive measures to endorse.

It's interesting that you, being a Brit, identify the USA as your diplomatic owner. We poor lazy biggotted ignorants in the south are more worried about Germany; so you see, we have different owners to be opposed to.

It begins with Germany supporting the exceptional flexibilities in the quantitative restrictions of chinese textiles imported to Europe. A decade or so later, we barely have a textile industry thanks to this shit, and it's only gone downhill since.

As soon as the new eastern countries started joining the EU, our companies moved there because the labour was cheaper.

We can be sure to see around 3 communications companies here go bankrupt as soon as the new rules about roaming are enforced in the next summer, rules which people in this sub seem very fond of.

Indeed, and you're not alone on that. Germany also prefers having the cheapest merchandise available to the German consumers, and if that means the merchandise is chinese instead of european, so be it. 

We're waiting to see how the solar panels problem will be solved, but it demonstrates how Germany and everyone big in the EU thinks about how great it is to have cheaper shit to buy.

Now, being the small market that we are, in addition to the inherent limitations we have regading not being able to produce more, diminish the costs in scale, or have marketing about quality products helping in exportations, we are out of industries in the country.

All you lovely people in the big countries say, oh that's just competition, you just weren't good enough, but we are the ones that have to live with a population of unqualified workers who are old and can't find a job anywhere.

You're just going Bwah, that's competition, which is funny, because all the other small countries in Europe are bound to suffer the same effects as soon as they increase their labour costs with a welfare state. 
Even funnier is thinking China won't extort the highest prices it can from us with their merchandise as soon as european competition is gone and they have the monopoly in our markets. Thinking in the short term, and worrying about the lowest price is bound to makes us hostages of the Chinese.

Our private sectors job market is now a service market, with minimum school requirements to be at a call center trying to sell people shit, and this is a heavily precary work sector, along with the mall stores.
The largest companies, and employeers, are something along the lines of McDonalds.

Lack of protectionism in the sectors where our market could have industries have utterly destroyed them.

Yes, we have invested in schooling the people who couldn't could go school in their time, and that wasn't enough.

The funds sent by Europe were given to people, both polititians and large companies, and you can be sure they didn't go around distributing it. No, the life quality didn't change thanks to Europe. 

The common citizen has seen no benefits from being in the European Union; on the contrary, the common citizen is either unemployed or has a job from which he can be fired within two weeks, all of which he can thank to ""european competition"".

We vote, we protest, and nothing improves.

There is no point in complaining about the USA, who are outside, when the biggest threat to us is inside the European Union.

The British, our oldest ""allies"", refused to buy portuguese debt. This caused the South American, logically so, to refuse to buy it too; because if the Europeans don't trust the Portuguese debt, why should the South Americans do so?

Germany has not only refused to devalue the euro to decrease the debts although we abdicated our monetary policies to be in the EU, refused to pardon the debts although it could, but dares telling us, and inforce, that the way to clear the debt is to enforce austerity in already poor communities, and a german court is currently sueing the European Central Bank for buying debt of the member states without previous approval from the German Parliament.

Not to mention the incredible racism abounding relating us southerners. A video was made explaining that the Portuguese have around the lowest minimum wages, and the highest work hours in europe, and the video was banned from being exhibited in Germany. Can't break the stereotype that we are lazy bastards going to the beach instead of working among the German peoples, they might actually realize that we are people who starve, and  didn't do anything to deserve this.

And you're worried about the Americans?",0,1371382117,null,0,1371383355,0,cajwta9,t3_1gf4qu,t1_cajwta9,t3_1gf4qu,null,1430792493,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

L'epiluminescenza è una baggianata non invasiva, il dermatologo vi guarda con un apparecchio che ingrandisce tutti i nei, fotografando quelli sospetti e cerando così un catalogo. Nella visita successiva (6 mesi o più) verificherà se tali nei sono mutati.

La prima e' il modello Pro, ovvero ha il tastierino numerico. Quella che voglio io, ovvero la Stealth (modello ""lusso"" della Rapid), e' di tipo ""tenkeyless"", ovvero piu' corta e leggera, utile per portarla in giro. E' una delle caratteristiche fondamentali per la mia scelta, quindi questa opzione la escluderei.

La seconda e' Rapid e non Stealth (modello ""lusso"" della Rapid), quindi ha un design un po' meno ""sexy"" (marca stampata enorme, carattere dei tasti stampato --&gt; rischio di sbiadimento, mancanza di led segnalatori), ed e' proposta con tasty Cherry Red e non Brown, quindi offrono una sensazione tattile piu' lineare e meno a scatto. Di sicuro si avvicina molto a quella che voglio, ma non e' proprio lei. Tengo d'occhio il link pero', in caso di eventuale ripiego!

Sono cosi' inpuntato sui particolari perche' da amazon.com e' facilissimo averla come la vorrei io, quindi non voglio ancora perdere le speranze di trovarla cosi' anche in Italia...

Beh, in Salento d'estate c'è MOLTO caldo, e dato che soffro subito a temperature alte (leggasi *sudo da far schifo*) l'estate è la stagione che mi piace di meno (almeno, l'estate QUI. Sono sicuro che se andassi in Finlandia starei da dio).

Però tutto questo problema dei condizionatori in Italia non mi sembra così grave. Penso che 23-24°C siano abbastanza confortevoli; 22°C se proprio si ha bisogno di un refrigerio immediato, alzando la temperatura di qualche grado dopo una ventina di minuti. Poi finché resto in città il problema manco si pone dato che dormo in lavanderia al 2° piano e senza condizionatore, ergo tutte le notti finestra spalancata e sole mutande.

Chi è stato in Giappone sa quanto siano criofili lì (a ben donde, la canicola umida di Kyoto non l'ho mai sentita in Italia, sembra di stare al bordo di una piscina in quanto a umidità); preferiscono ammalarsi piuttosto che sentire caldo. Dall'estate dopo il terremoto e lo tsunami del Tohoku c'è un battage onnipresente sulla temperatura dei condizionatori, facendoti quasi sentire colpevole se la setti al di sotto dei 25-27°C (anche perché i gestori fanno blackout programmati quando si sforano determinate soglie).

It is possible, but also possible that the publisher puts some restrictions on games. http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/license

&gt; almost nothing speaks for the xbox one as a consumer.

Well, from the same link, you can play your games library on anyone else's xbox by signing in, and you can have 10 'family' who can play all of your games library for free from any xbox (even with you and one family member playing the same game simultaneously). Having the games exist digitally instead of physically does give a number of benefits to the consumer. Unfortunately in order to provide those benefits and prevent cheating the system the xbox requires the 24hr check in thing, and also enables a number of new DRM options for the developers. 

I'm certainly not suggesting that the xbox is a better choice than the PS4 when the PS4 is cheaper and has more powerful hardware. But there is a great deal of misinformation about the xbox which reddit is doing a very poor job of filtering out and correcting with the voting system.

I thought it was pretty obvious that 1200 would be the total number. At any rate, even if what you say is true, that's still 55% laid off. 5% doesn't make that much of a difference to my point.

&gt; Yesterday I've read Malcolm Brabant's adventure. He was BBC's correspondent in Athens for many years, but not as a permanent employee.

There are many kinds of employees. Almost no one at ERT now is a permanent employee either. There's also those with open contracts (αορίστου χρόνου), those that have contracts for a few months and finally those that are basically external contractors (με μπλοκάκι). So, it's not like it's 1200 people with lofty permanent positions. 

&gt; If you were familiar with orchestras you'd know that you can't reduce the number of e.g. violinists by 55%. It doesn't work that way. 

It doesn't work that way with any other speciality either. But obviously 55% will go. If the orchestras are not downsized that means that maybe journalists will take an even greater hit in their numbers. 

&gt; ERT is obviously bloated and we are all to blame. Not the way Pangalos means it. Don't defend the undefendable, it's like some people woke up one day and loved classical music. Please. It doesn't break your heart more than mine to see these women being caught in a shitty situation. I'm the first one that will sign any initiative to keep our orchestras alive, but I won't defend the excess numbers of so-called journalists.

Tutto a posto, ma d'ora in poi saró religiosa nel farmi seguire, anche se non sará semplice dato che giá vivo all'estero e mi trasferisco in un altro paese fra due mesi.

Per il caldo invece é la mia personale tragedia. Amo il mare, in spiaggia mi organizzo bene stando in acqua e la sabbia non mi fa disperare piú come prima. Ma ragazzi....io sono sarda.

Girare in cittá prima delle 18 é un suicidio. 

L'umiditá é perenne. Il sudore é perenne. Non importa quanto ti vesti leggero, tanto la pelle non te la puoi levare. Zitto e suda! 

La cittá é deserta perché sono tutti o in spiaggia o in ufficio, immobili sotto l'aria condizionata.

E ti DEVI abbronzare, sennó ti notano troppo.

Quelle due settimane di mare, con uscite solo la sera, sono piú che sufficienti!

Lots and lots of silver birch trees. Swampland and rivers, towns in what appears the middle of nowhere. Decades of industrial growth and destruction pass you by in the most remote stretches of track.

I spent a good deal of it drinking with russian soldiers and a handfull of tourists onboard. I had a cabin (4 bed) all to myself because the train was not busy. The window provided surprisingly mediative viewing, It was a great time to think (Would have been different if I was stuck in with a bunch of chinese migrant traders/merchants - which happend further along on my journey).

It was an experience, to see the earth changing, the timezones swap continuously throughout the day. The constant rocking of the tracks like a mothers arms and bizar stops in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. Donkeys tied to a fence with no human in sight, wood cabins with no paths or roads. I found the people in east russia more willing to open up and accept travellers. Far more bohemian and expressive, Moscow certainly does remain a very overwhelming city, one that harbours a cruelty and intimidation. I met great people everywhere i visited, though the russians i encountered in east russia weren't long expressing their joy at being far from Moscow. I wish i visited St.Petersburg but due to getting shafted by the police officer I lost my patience with russia/russians a bit. 

All was restored by lake baikal when russian familys invited me to join them for victory day celebrations. I had one more encounter with the police whilst waiting for a train into mongolia. I sat on a bench near the station with a large russian beer. It was warm day and I was savouring my last hour before another leg of the journey. As i was about to open my bottle I turned to the two guys next to me and in weak russian i asked if it is ok to drink alcohol near the station. One of them spoke good english so we began to talk for a while, 

he said ""don't worry, open your beer, enjoy it""

He was curious why i was so cautious and so i informed him of what had happened to me. So he turned to his friend and translated the story for him, this friend wasn't much of a talker, nor did he make many expressions. He only had one question which he said in broken english

""Why you come to Russia? not America?""

I replied because i was interested and intrigued, that i wanted to see it for myself. That I had also been to America but always wanted to visit Russia too.

He wanted to know what people thought of Russia? do your people fear us? hate us?

I told him I can't say, I don't think people fear or hate russia generally. People don't know russia, all we know and see on TV of is 'Old russia', thats why I was curious.

He then asked about my passport, so thinking in good nature that he'd like to see it after it was mentioned talking about visas I took it from my pocket and passed it to him. The first guy asked if I was glad to be leaving russia 

I replied ""a little bit, yes. Mostly because I look forward to the road ahead, i've enjoyed myself but the incident with the police has made me a little bitter.""  i then muttered ""fucking police""

So the guy with my passport, after examining it for sometime looked up at me and took from his pocket a badge.

I thought i was fucked again, but he smiled and his friend informed me they work in internal investigations within the police force. They apologised for what had happened and asked that i not hold it against them. 

For a brief moment as he had both my passport and his badge in his hands i could see myself heading towards a cell on some trumped up charges. His last words as I was set to leave

""Moscow is a long way from here, safe journey""

I'd do it again in a heart beat, spending less time in Moscow perhaps.

&gt;In short, it's not about whether we want ERT to shut down or stay open ('we' as in the people protesting). The thing is, that if it is shut down in this way, we legitimise that the government can do whatever they want, without control from the Parliament, only with two signatures.

If that doesn't bother you, then God knows what awaits us. If we accept this (indeed we have accepted lot of similar things already), then more and worse will follow....

Le genre n'est pas neutre, le féminin a une connotation négative ? Si je dis à une personne qui s'identifie visiblement à une femme qu'elle est très féminine aujourd'hui, c'est méchant, et si je lui dis que c'est un vrai bonhomme c'est l'inverse ?

Le genre a un rapport avec l'identité sexuelle ? Je ne comprends même pas, je croyais qu'on avait le droit de préférer ce qu'on voulait, il faut aussi rentrer dans des cases ?

Les études de genre c'est un sujet que j'ai découvert il y a quelque jours que je ne connaissais pas du tout, alors j'aimerais très volontiers qu'on m'éclaire dessus parce que soit je suis vraiment passé à côté de quelque chose, soit c'est un genre de foutage de gueule moraliste

 But us megacorps are so corrupt they try to sink in *all the money* instead of just skimming. So now people are descending to poverty and they'll explode against it soon.

On the other side of the scale if too much money were to be ""released for market"" too quickly the USD value would also tank and inflation explode zimbabwe style.

But at least for those who see the Second Amendment as a safeguard against the government, the question should be what would happen if the population lost control over the government. If you want to have a revolution, the ability to *organize* a resistance is much more important than access to weapons (not that those typically available to civilians would do much against a standing military, anyway). Also keep in mind that whistleblowers from within the government are just as exposed to this kind of surveillance as everybody else.

I think with the above I'm pretty deep in paranoia territory, but I believe that technologically we're at a point where we have to decide which path we want to take. For the first time, it has become possible to record, store and automatically analyze the entirety of communications, and more and more aspects of our daily lives express themselves through communication. Not just interpersonal communication, but private interests, movement, and so on. It's becoming possible to e.g., detect depression by voice and facial expression analysis. ""They"" can almost literally look into your head. You can draw a detailed picture of somebody's personality with those signals, and it can be done automatically at a negligible cost.

Worth noting that Europe depends on the US satellite network for GPS navigation.  Russia also allows Europe to use GLONASS, however a kill switch is enabled if Russian Aerospace Defense Forces are activated for actual combat missions.


Europe should have the Galileo GPS operational in 2014.  So far all the satellites have been placed in orbit by Russian Soyuz rockets.

Every scientific progress enables us to improve our technology and lets us built on this new knowledge by giving us the understanding to progress further.

&gt; A neutral language can be acquired in three possible ways:

&gt; a) choosing a national language which belongs to none of the peoples who have joined the new community, e.g. Arabic. This solution was chosen in ex-colonial countries, like English in India or Nigeria, French in some African countries etc.

&gt; b) choosing one of the dead languages, which could be revived and on whose base European culture grew historically, like Latin or Ancient Greek. This solution was chosen by the Israelis when they renewed and “revived” the dead Hebrew language.

&gt; c) choosing one of the new romance languages which were initiated by linguists or by Movements like Esperanto, (which has developed a unique culture and linguistic treasury during its history of over 120 years). This type of solution was chosen in Indonesia and in several other polynesian countries (Bahasa Indonesian is a language based on a Malaysian langiage whose grammar linguists developed in the middle of the 1950’s in a regular and planned way, and is now used by more than 200 million people ).

Now that we've got 27 and soon to be 28 members, it's almost impossible to pass reforms as opposed to when we had 9 or 11, or 15. It's still possible to fix these problems, but it is so much harder now. It's also, not going to get any easier if we keep expanding.

Describes and addresses:

* Debt and credit rating
* Currency valuation
* Eastern EU competition
* Low wages
* Austerity
* Chinese trade
* German mandates
* Ethnic differences


Clearly defining the problems and communicating them is essential to create effective solutions and desired results.


There is no US agenda to track the Portugese online, search you homes in the dark of night, seize all cans of feijões, and sell them to the highest bidder in order to fund our military hegemony.

There's also another, smaller and older 'castle' there (more of a summer palace, but it's called Hohenschwangau) that overlooks a small lake. It's just down the hill from Neuschwanstein. Also, if you have the time, there are hiking trails in the mountains surrounding the castles. You can get some great pictures by following the trail that leads up the hill behind Neuschwanstein. This trial leads you across a bridge that goes over a small waterfall behind the castle where you can get some beautiful pictures, but everyone stops there. If you hike about 15-20 minutes further, you'll have chances to get some pics that most people don't. You can tour the castle, but you can't take pictures inside and it's really not that great from what I hear. When I went, I spent so much time taking photos outside and walking the trails that I didn't make it back in time to take the tour. 

Also, I didn't check the bus schedule for the return trip to the station, so I missed the last bus back and had to walk back to Fussen in the dark.
