true,arrrg,null,null,"Or the [Pinakothek art museums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunstareal).

To be honest, I find the Deutsche Museum to be extremely dull and old fashioned. Maybe they changed since I have been there last (and maybe it’s because I have been there so damn often during my childhood), I don’t know. But I think art museums are extremely cool even if you have (like myself, sadly) little to no idea about the historical context and something different for once.

The Pinakothek der Moderne (the modern building) has also a cool exhibition on design. (It’s closed until September for renovations but should be open again in October.)

I would also recommend leaving for the game a bit earlier than one hour before the game starts. I have been to a few games in Munich and generally got into the U-Bahn at Marienplatz 90 minutes to two hours before the games started. At that point the U-Bahn might not yet be completely filled with people wanting to get to the game. The trip to the Arena will take about 30-45 minutes.

But shouldn’t you run around the city center and have obnoxiously loud chanting competitions with Bayern fans? That’s what I usually see in the city on game days. And I guess that’s also a way to spend the time. You will easily be able to find and hang out with many fellow fans (if you are a fan which I guess you are).

Also, have fun losing to Munich! (It sadly looks like I won’t be able to get tickets for that game.)",0,1378679287,null,0,false,0,cc4ekva,t3_1lzekh,t1_cc4ekva,t1_cc4a4lx,null,1429544717,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

It would fit.

""Des hät mer"" is a (southern) dialect for ""Das hätten wir/Das haben wir"".

Which translates to ""We got that (part)/We are done (with this part)"".

EDIT:

To clarify a little about why that is, or would be, funny:

Depending on where this is taken, they could not be used to the dialect, therefore thinking it is funny.
 
This could be from his time in Vienna, so not sure about Austrian dialect, I would have thought they could be quite used to such phrases. On the other hand speaking in dialect can trivialise things, and therefore be funny.

There could have been an arc of tension (mabye regarding his moodswings), that now drops, or with him being funny they could just be in the right mood to laugh at something like that.

I do like his version a lot.
Toscanini (1941, which i think he refers to in the beginning) was good too, but i think his version is ""cleaner"", i just favor it a little. Altough Böhm (more so) and Karajan are not bad either.

true,Sambri,ESPA,Spain,"&gt;All changes would presume a changes at a constitutional level, is it that difficult to make the change?

Theoretically, no, in the practice, yes: any change in the constitution requires the agreement of the two biggest parties in Spain (conservatives and socialdemocrats) and it is hard for them to agree in these questions. By now, only two changes have been made to the constitution: one in order to adapt to the Maastricht treaty, it only included the words ""and pasive""; the other one is considered to have been imposed by Germany in 2011 and is about limiting the possible debt of the regions.

&gt;Most expenses(payments) take place at a regional level(schools, roads or social services) so I would expect a ""slim"" government could handle a decentralised fiscal system.

Health care, school system and many infrastructures are paid by the regions, however the central government sets most of the laws concerning them. The central government is also the biggest source of income of the regions and therefore is the target of many complaints from the regions. 

Also, take into account that a lot of power was given to the regions right before the crisis (specially education and healthcare) and that Spain is going through bad times, so more transfers of power are not being discussed (except for Catalonia).

Because the drama between the communities is making living in Brussels annoying (and is actually preventing me from living there). The stupid shenanigan about taxation make so that it's pretty much impossible to get the funds to develop a proper infrastructure. 


The trains are not there because of problem with the communes in the periphery (the last one finally gave its accord, twenty years after the beginning of the RER project).


The ring should be expended, but guess what? No accords....


And now it's hard to find a place to live because, due to the stupid linguistic border that cricle Brussels completely, you HAVE to learn a dying language that no one know to live there.

You know the problem : they don't want to live in Antwerpen. They don't want to live in Bruge. They want to live in Brussels.

Khan Tervel, her second khan, defeated the Arabs who were about to take Constantinopole and he ""saved"" Christian Europe much like Martel did, except he wasn't Christian.

In the beginning the proto-Bulgarians ruled the country but they were a minority so in time Slavs took their place. Right now the country is Slavic.

Khan Krum drank from a Byzantine Emperor's skull, making him the first Byzantine Emperorto ever fall in battle.

Kniaz Boris made them Christian.

After taking Christianity and Slavs starting to rule the country their rulers took the name ""tsar"".

They made the Cyrillic alphabet.

After the Templars took the Byzantine they tried to take Bulgaria but the Bulgarians kicked the shit out of them.

They were enslaved by the Ottoman Empire for 500 years.

The guy who made the computer was of Bulgarian descent.

At some point Bulgaria was as big as the Balkans, Romania included.

After the liberation from the Turks a treaty was made of the new country's borders. It was huge because to the North East it went to Ukrane, to the South it had most of the Turkish European land and most of Northern Greece. Plus the whole Macedonia and a good part f Serbia. Of course the great powers back then did want such a big rival on the Balkans so they cut Bulgaria. Half of their lands(mind you that when the treaty was made they were full with Bulgarians but later they immigrated to the free part of their country) still are outside of the country.

They have yoghurt and cheap booze.

Good at many sports, especially volleyball and weightlifting, but they love football which they are bad at. In the Olympics before 1989 they were often only second to the USSR in medals. From the Eastern block.

Very nice for biking - You can travell all around the country in 2-3 weeks, there is a lot of well made sightseeing places - like lanterns and old churches on Hiuma and Sarema, or totally unexpected briliant museum of roads (near Polva - south of Tartu). There are free places for camping with benches, fireplace, toilet, usually dry wood and traditional big swing (teeter?). Almost empty roads where You can speed.

Majority thinks their countrymen feel more European than 10 years ago. Majority thinks they will be more involved in European affairs by 2025. Absolute majority thinks that what brings us together is more important than what separates us. 

OTOH people currently interested in European affairs is down by 8 points and majority not interested.

VHS is mad cheap though, by design, and that's probably why your hosts picked it. Think American community college compared to private college, because that's essentially what it is. I can promise you you'd be out five to ten times more cash if they sent you to a private Sprachschule with English-speaking teachers spelling things out for you. I've been to classes at them, I've worked for them, *and* I've done upper-level German at a local VHS for comparison's sake. Trust me, you're better off.

Though I am confused why you'd take/stay with the job if you're unsatisfied, but the experience is what you make of it, I suppose.

Immersion is a time-honored method and one that often provides the strongest results. The linguistic research is solidly behind this. Work through the initial discomfort. Millions of permanent immigrants, whom you resent for whatever reason, have built up to fluency this way, and you can too.

Or, y'know, keep calm and Duolingo. LiveMocha is also okay. Just don't shell out for Rosetta Stone. As a language teacher, nothing depresses me more.

I was the only English native speaker in my upper-level VHS class, but since it was upper-level, we all knew enough German to communicate.

I can imagine lower-level is way harder to adapt to in this style, but I never went through that because I had already been a German major in college in the US. 

Like I said, you *could* find a tutor who will explain in English, but it will be expensive. Not worth it with your wages, honestly. I was a big skeptic of Duolingo at first, but I actually like it a lot. Devote time to that and your VHS class will be illuminated.

Give them a hand, and they'll take your arm. If we just counted the percentage of French speakers above the linguistic border we'd get 10%. The existence of the bilingual region in Brussels is a favor to  French speakers and yet another sign of the willingness of Dutch speakers to compromise to make Belgium possible, give it a shared capital.. But somehow it becomes a sign of narrowmindedness after being contorted by propagandists.

&gt;I Menen case, don't tell me it's not just displaying bad faith and oppressing French speakers.

The arrangement we agreed upon was that each language would get its own territory. Disrespecting that deal is displaying bad faith and a lack of cooperation. Retracting a favor that is being overused is not oppression.

&gt;this has gone too far in hateful measures and hidden attacks against Brussellers, Walloons, Fransquillons and the French language in the end.

There is a transfer of economic benefits from north to south. French speakers have more political power than they should have based on population numbers. Dutch speakers do much more effort to learn and speak the French than the other way around. Dutch speakers have ceded a part of the territory on their side of the language border (the smallest one already) for a bilingual capital... but somehow, it's the French speakers who are oppressed. IF they're oppressed, why don't they want to separate?

&gt;Flanders wasn't left aside when Wallonia was the Belgium's money maker during the industrial revolution

Actually it was. There were more investments in the south (as opposed to the period post 1950, when the waffle iron politics were in force), and the outdated tax system ensured that the more populous north was more heavily taxed.

&gt;now that it's time to pay back

Please, do look up the *actual* numbers instead of assuming.

So are we going to put them on the moon?

&gt;I don't see why nuclear power should have to stick with uranium just because that's what's currently being done, sure there would be high transitional costs, but it would be better than uranium. And if uranium reserves are as limited as you say, that's just another reason to use thorium instead.

The designs aren't functional yet, and it's not clear whether they ever will be with affordable materials. Put the same research effort into renewables or storage instead, where it *will* improve efficiency. Why not go for the renewables right away? Let's keep nuclear elements in reserve, for spaceflight for example.

&gt;I can't say that someone wouldn't fuck something up or someone wouldn't cut corners, but considering the likelihood of a power plant in Germany being struck by both an earthquake and a tsunami, and the fact that human error could just as well happen in some other type of power plant, I don't think it's a reason to rule out nuclear power.

Even the US which are on the extreme side of capitalism implement socialist programs (welfare, medicaid or whatever). 

What's important is the (as you said) *successful* part of this implementation. For instance in the case of the USA they spend roughly double their GDP other countries do on healthcare to *appear* more capitalist - as the Americans believe in the *an honest days work for an honest days pay* horse shit. But instead of just having a socialist model that includes everyone is cheaper they instead choose to have a capitalist model (which has elements of socialism in it anyway!) which means they piss roughly 8 percent of their gdp of their economy up the wall (all those lawyers/insurance companies need to be paid). And despite all that they haven't created a capitalist healthcare system - as a pure capitalist healthcare system would be utterly barbaric.

But I think a thing often overlooked is political systems. In countries like the US (and increasingly the UK) voter apathy is becoming a more and more political problem - being involved or discussing politics becomes a bit taboo. If people don't vote their views are not taken into account and they're further disenfranchised from the political system. It's an awful downward spiral I fear the UK  is on.

true,petshaver,LITH,Lithuania,"We come from the same side of the Iron curtain, also we have a common recent history of European integration, so Bulgaria is quite well known to Lithuanians. I'm going to share some bits and pieces about Bulgaria that I know, as presented from Lithuanian point of view.

* Bulgarian communists were extremely loyal to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. I even heard a rumour that Bulgaria wished to enter USSR as the 16th Soviet republic. However, Bulgaria had a reputation of being more developed than USSR and was famous for its beaches on the Black Sea and also for nice weather. Sadly, it was almost impossible for most Lithuanians to actually visit Bulgaria, as traveling abroad was restricted.

* In the 1990s when it became possible to travel freely to Bulgaria, Lithuanians started going there for vacation, some were even buying real estate near the sea. However, other countries, such as Greece, Spain and Turkey became much more popular in this regard during the 2000s. I believe the reason for this is that Bulgaria became more expensive than before. But I'm sure that the situation can change once again, if Bulgarians manage to improve their tourist facilities and develop their coastal region a bit more.

* Lithuanian retail companies and other businesses have interest in Bulgaria. We Lithuanians like to imagine that we have an advantage there because we can do business in a productive Western fashion, while we also have the ability not to be scared by a little bit of good old Wild West. However, it seems that it's not that simple, as businessmen are complaining about the level of corruption and also organised crime. They say that in this respect Bulgaria is similar to 1990s Lithuania. I'm absolutely sure, that this situation is temporary, but you better be quick to deal with it.

* There is a very special connection between Lithuania and Bulgaria. Arguably, the most famous Lithuanian of late 19th and early 20th century was Jonas Basanavicius ([this guy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/50_litai_%282003%29.jpg)). He was more or less the leader of the Lithuanian national revival movement, that makes him directly responsible for Lithuanian independence. So, Mr Basanavicius actually spent many years in coastal Bulgarian city of Varna. He held a Bulgarian citizenship and was also elected to the city council.

* Lastly, *Varna* means 'crow' in Lithuania (Lithuanian *varna* is related to slavic *vorona*, by the way), that makes it a very funny name for a city.",0,1378724216,null,0,false,0,cc4pvwv,t3_1m0k9p,t1_cc4pvwv,t3_1m0k9p,null,1429539298,23,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,23

The most interesting thing about that region is that it used to be the centre of the industrial revolution, had a huge breakdown afterwards (a bit Detroit-ish, but no safety issues today!) and has been transformed to a cultural centre in the past years. There are many buildings left from heavy industry which have been formed into a park or a museum (my favourite: the [Landschaftspark Nord](http://en.landschaftspark.de/startseite) in Duisburg). Additionally cultural events are offered a lot (e.g. the [Ruhrtriennale](http://www.ruhrtriennale.de/en/) until Oct 6th).

If this is the horse shit that people in modern EU countries are against, then I am disgusted by modernity. 

The Scandinavian model is far from socialism. They have simple and effective tax systems, transparent government, and they even implement the voucher system in schools and (I think) healthcare. Even the taxes are not so sky high as most people tend to think. 

Meanwhile in USA they have a clusterfuck of lobbyists from big pharma, agro and military hardware companies in bed with the congress. And the dominant mechanism of earning money has long been one of paying the congress to regulate your competition out of business. The USA is kept afloat by small business and individual creativity, while the industrial sector is completely messed up by lobbying. The scary thing is that EU and Brussels is also becoming a huge breeding ground for lobbyists and sell out politicians. The wild west, Free Capitalist States of America sadly exist only in westerns and fantasies of people who prefer stereotypes to reality. 

P.S. Completely state owned healthcare system is even more barbaric. NHS is constantly rocked by scandals like:

RE should go too, but that barely took up an hour a week when I was in school. 

As for other subjects I can't think of anything that comes close to languages for the lack of utility it provides in later life. Education at that level needs to build a framework so you can chose the specialise later.

What does language build up to? It's a useful skill on the job market in certain sectors sure but it's not like maths which might lead up to Engineering and Scientific pursuits.

And this isn't some crusade on languages, I'm struggling to see where History (my favourite subject in school) fits into it too. There's some vague awareness benefit and it helps with critical thinking but it's not as obvious as maths or English.

In an ideal world children would be specialising sooner so they can cut out subjects of little value to themselves, I'm not really sure if people are even capable of making that choice as an adult though.

I'll tell you what you can have a work ethic on the extreme side like Japan where you have to be *seen* to be working hard. Appearances are everything in Japan though so expect to arrive at the office at 7am and not leave until 8pm. What you end up with is a keeping up appearances style work ethic - it doesn't matter that you spend 4 hours at work each playing solitaire on facebook etc.

Working smarter and working more concentrated means theoretically we shouldn't even need a 4 day week. 

As to your comparison as that state owned healthcare is even more barbaric - I can literally point you to any healthcare system in the world and pull horror stories galore from various tabloids. (I notice your source is ""thenewamerican"" which has ""Freedom shall not perish"" as it's slogan - well done on getting a non-bias, evenly reported reliable source on that story).  No system is perfect or infallible from human stupidity. 

In terms of efficiency the US is ranked 46th of 48 countries ranked. Notice how state owned healthcare ranks amongst the best in the world.

An older report places the NHS as 2nd most efficient but the UK has since slipped down a bit

Back to the remark about horse shit values in the protestant work ethic - it's almost irrelevant in the 21st century. 

IE. digging 40 holes with a spade may take you 200 hours. Programming a robot to dig a more precise hole in 4 hours would be a smarter work ethic and more profitable for your company. German's also work much less harder than most of Europe- but because they have a smart, productive work ethic their economy is much better than most of Europe. In fact if you look at the hardest working countries in Europe you'll see most of the harder working countries are not anywhere as good as the more productive countries and in fact the *harder working countries correlate with the least productive countries.* http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17155304",0,1378728823,null,0,1378729423,0,cc4qjxb,t3_1m0vdg,t1_cc4qjxb,t1_cc4q9tg,null,1429538987,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Our politicians are working on destroying any private owned health care institutions, and they are saying that they are following the Nordic or British model which is quite absurd. It's a sensitive topic because the state owned healthcare institutions are utter rubbish in my country (and in most other post soviet states).  

Tell me, can your visit to a private healthcare institution be financed by the state (I'm not sure like you have insurance money, that you can use in an institution of your choice - private or state owned)? I'm asking out of curiosity, because that would be the ideal model in my opinion. I have heard that you have something similar in Norway. 

And about the statistics. I've lead a few sociological studies and so far and I can tell you that you can usually make the conclusions you like from any set of statistics. Comrade stalin once said that there are three types of lies in the world - small lies, big lies and statistics. 

Sometimes understanding motivation and incentives helps better that analyzing statistics. i.e. if a waiter would get equal pay regardless how he serves his customers, he would most likely not be motivated to serve well.

Also Paella.

Catalonian secessionism outside of Spain is a non-issue.

If there is nothing solid by 2014 nothing will happen. Mas will blame the evil Spaniards, his voters will eat that up and keep voting for him again. He'll lose the radical vote to ERC, but ERC have proven to be willing accomplices of whatever neoliberal decrees CiU needs to push to keep the markets happy as long as the fabled Indepèndencia is at the end of the tunnel.

An ERC majority is an interesting situation that won't happen any time soon, I'm afraid.

&gt;In Italia la lontra è estremamente rara e sopravvive solo in alcune zone del sud Italia (Parco nazionale del Pollino-parco nazionale del Cilento e Vallo di Diano - Basilicata e Calabria, Puglia, Molise e Campania); del centro (fiume Sangro, Parco nazionale della Maiella, Abruzzo) e del nord (Ticino e Alto Adige).
Nel 1988 ha avuto inizio il Progetto Lontra del Parco naturale della Valle del Ticino con l'obiettivo di ripopolare le acque del fiume omonimo, un tempo ricche di questi animali. Il 22 agosto 1997 in località Bosco Vedro del Comune di Cameri (NO) è stata rilasciata la prima coppia di lontra comune europea (Lutra lutra).
A seguito della legge quadro ministeriale per il reinserimento della lontra[senza fonte], sono state realizzate aree faunistiche nei comuni di Penne e Caramanico Terme e il reinserimento di una coppia di esemplari lungo il fiume Orta.
Dal 2004 è in corso un progetto finalizzato alla conservazione della Lontra in Puglia. Il progetto è stato ideato è condotto dal Centro Studi Naturalistici per conto della Comunità Montana dei Monti Dauni Settentrionale. Lo studio ha evidenziato che la popolazione di lontre nel bacino dell'Ofanto è tra le più importanti presenti in Italia. Nel 2007 ricercatori del WWF, hanno constatato la presenza di diversi esemplari, nella Riserva naturale guidata Cascate del Verde.

Moreover, these fired are to be replaced on a one-for-one basis (Troika agreed to this). You are correct about the pay cuts and the restricting ratio (although it's 1 for 5 retirees, 1 for 10 applies only to public companies) but we were talking about layoffs. 

As for your second question, since the Troika demanded in exchange for the loans a gradual reduction of the deficit this can be achieved either with spending cuts or with increasing revenue or a combination of the two. Naturally the govt went for a combination albeit in a manner that imho hurts the private sector more (vastly increasing tax rates of all sorts, including corporate tax rate) and while this typically hurts all people (including public sector workers), given that they at least didn't lose their jobs, it mainly aggravated the suffocation of the private sector.

true,Vaeldr,ITAL,Italy,"Right that is what some Bulgarians like to say but I highly doubt it. Reasons are as follows:

When the five sons of Kubrat split, many Bulgarians stayed in the old Bulgaria with their father. The rest who weren't much already, went 4 different directions. That's a small group right there for Asparuh. In fact the groups were so small that out of the 4 brothers who left, 2 disappeared in oblivion. On top of that the other son made a Bulgaria on the Volga river. So chances are Ukrainians have more proto-Bulgarian blood than Bulgarians. The difference is that the Bulgarians we know now managed to keep their name and culture.

Slavic blood started ruling Bulgaria as soon as khan Krum, since he was half Slavic.

Kniaz Boris annihilated the proto-Bulgarian nobility because they wouldn't accept Christianity. It was 52 huge noble families. So that is a lot of dead Bulgarians.

The truth is that Boris himself was more Slavic than he was Bulgarian.

If there is only 3-4% Slavic genetic makeup from Slavs that would mean that Slavs are no more than 5-6%. So tell me, how does such a tiny, irrelevant minority manage to impose it's language and culture on the(in your words) vast Bulgarian majority. 

The proto-Bulgarians(the few of them) and the Slavs didn't really manage to stay separate entities because they were united first by religion and then they had to unite to survive while being in the Byzantine and Turkish Empires.

Also, I have seen Bulgarians. They look like Slavs. Sure, a bit darker than Russians(due to more Sun) but more or less similar features. Plus Bulgarians are lighter than Serbs(in my experience).

So basically today's Bulgarians are a mix of mostly Slavs and some proto-Bulgarians and some Tracians. Now obviously proto-Bulgarian culture was really strong so it is kept to this day in the country, but that's it.

I'll even tell you when the theories about Bulgarians being non-Slavs came from. Bulgaria was an ally of Nazi Germany, and since Hitler considered Slavs inferior they had to find a way to make Bulgarians part of the ""superior"" race.

Of course those are just my conclusions based on historical facts and experiences. If you care to elaborate on the trustworthy survey that would change my mind, I'd be happy to enrich my knowledge on the genetics of Bulgarians.",0,1378739425,null,0,1378739624,0,cc4t5xo,t3_1m0k9p,t1_cc4t5xo,t1_cc4styd,null,1429537769,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7
true,peggy_olson_draper,null,null,"&gt;Sur fond de divisions des pays membres du G20 réunis à Saint-Pétersbourg, le seuil des deux millions de Syriens fuyant leur pays a été franchi, selon le Haut-commissariat des Nations unies pour les réfugiés (HCR).

&gt;Au jour le jour, environ 5 000 Syriens cherchent refuge à l’étranger.

&gt; L’Unicef vient d’annoncer que plus de la moitié des deux millions de réfugiés ont moins de 18 ans, évoquant la « pire crise humanitaire depuis le génocide rwandais ».



&gt;Depuis le début du conflit, les pays limitrophes sont les plus hospitaliers. À la fin du mois d’août, 720 000 personnes ont trouvé refuge au Liban, 520 000 en Jordanie, 464 000 en Turquie, 200 000 en Irak et 111 000 en Égypte.

&gt;Chargé de coordonner l'action humanitaire, le HCR se plaint de n'avoir reçu que 47 % des contributions financières indispensables pour répondre aux besoins de première urgence.

&gt;Dans l'UE, deux pays sortent du lot : l’Allemagne et la Suède, qui hébergent à eux seuls près des deux tiers des 40 000 Syriens ayant déposé une demande d’asile en Europe depuis le début de la crise.

&gt;La Suisse et l'Autriche viennent respectivement de donner le feu vert à 500 réfugiés. Quelques autres pays ont proposé leurs services, comme la Suède, la Norvège et les Pays-Bas.

&gt;**À quelques exceptions près, seuls les demandeurs d'asile arrivant jusqu'en France sont autorisés à déposer un dossier en se présentant eux-mêmes en préfecture. Ce qui suppose d'avoir obtenu un visa en Syrie ou d'avoir franchi sans autorisation de nombreuses frontières internationales.**

&gt;**Paris a compliqué la tâche aux éventuels postulants en rétablissant un visa de transit aéroportuaire à destination des… Syriens. Supprimé en avril 2010, ce document a été réintroduit en janvier 2013 afin de « lutter contre les détournements de procédure ».**

&gt;Médecins du monde (MDM), qui a ouvert des centres de soins en Jordanie et au Liban, reproche également à la France de n'être « pas au rendez-vous ». Ses équipes dans le Nord-Pas-de-Calais observent la présence de nombreux Syriens sur le littoral, qui « faute de facilités données pour obtenir l'asile », vivent dans des conditions de vie « indignes ».

Now I'm lucky if I even get 16 Mb. Average Speed is 6 Mb, but at times when most people are home (weekends and evenings) 3 Mb is to be expected. 

I complain to them every month, but they don't do anything about it. There was a tech support guy who changed our cables and checked everything. He said that the problem is not on my side, but he can't do anything about it. He also said that at the end of this year 100 Mb plans should be available in my area, and I really hope that changes things.

Most of the KD customers I have talked to online don't have any problems and love to praise KD to heaven. Finally I found someone with a similar experience.

In my opinion Romania has huge issues right now, and those money should be spent somewhere else, and not on maintaining stray dogs alive especially when there are so many of them. The Romanian state was too incompetent during the times when this was only a minor problem. In 2001 I think, Basescu was mayor and he tried to neuter them from one wave, but he failed as it was done superficially. [Now, it has come to this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1JLzuf7T0A) Even I was bit when I was a kid, while mom was holding my hand. 



Of course it's partly the fault of the people who abandon them in the street, and partly the fault of Ceausescu who demolished a large portion of rural areas in the past, which set a ton of dogs free. In the end, it's our own fault that these dogs are in the street.  But what now? Isn't it too late to care just about this? If we chop off their balls, their teeth won't fall either. Don't get me wrong, I cannot wait for the day until these guys will get fined extremely harsh, but the dogs are still there.



So what will happen to them exactly?The dogs will be moved to shelters, and if in two weeks(I think) people do not adopt them, they end up euthanized. It won't be done en masse though. Little by little they will be lifted from the streets and sent to shelters. And this raises a question from me: is it true that in developed European countries homeless dogs are euthanized if people do not adopt them? Or does it depend on how many of them are there or sickness?



 For instance, what would Germany do if out of the sudden 100.000 dogs appear on the streets of Berlin? How do the authorities react? Do you consider this act that Romania does to be barbaric, since a lot of animal activists started to criticize us severely.

What is important for us now is that the governments, the interest groups and the press get to know who are the catalans and what we want, and the way we are trying to acomplish it. Later, in case we  succeed, it will be the turn of the respective governments and again the press, etc to explain who are these people that suddenly just created a new state in western europe. We'll do our part, off course, as we are doing already, but in the end we are the ones who will get to vote, one way of another, for independence; you say no one outside spain cares about this? I'll agree with you, and i'll add more: we have nothing to show them as of yet; we are the ones who have to move our asses. 

I think a really flawed point in your argument is the constant ""political-bickeringization""; 2014 nothing will happen, ERC here, CiU there, puppet sock on, puppet sock off, god cop bad cop, etc. And this is a point where i really suspect you are not acting in good faith here. Off course everyone is entitled to it's own opinion, and if you consider yourself on the far left -i only say this because you write on several occasion about the ""catalan burgeoise, the catalan oligarchs, the enslaved people that sheepeshly follow the politicians, etc- that's all right for me, personally i m a member of the CUP-AE, Arran and of the COS; what is not so fine is that most of the time, this talk about ""oligarchs and slaves and nationalist egomaniacs"" seem to be directed much more to harm the independentist movement than to actually critisize the society's class structure and injustice. The EI (independentist left, in catalan, which is the term that we use to refer to all of the organizations, syndicates, parties etc which pursue socialism and independence fort he Catalan Countries) has always, for all its 60 years of existence defended that class rights and social justice is absolutely inherent to the will of creating a catalan, valencian and balearic federation of states. I've found very few foreign observers, spanish or otherwise which now anything about how the independentist movement organise itself; it is really a true grassroots movement, the ANC, the major umbrella organisation is not a political party, and it never will, and in there there's people of all political options (in the catalan parliament there are 7 parties and bipartidism is rare, although it happened some times) with only one objective, which is to create a catalan state which guarantees the welfare and the rights of its inhabitants, while respecting the culture and the language. If you think that right now the political parties can move around their puppets and just change the way the civil society feels about the independence, you are wrong. Those ""radicals"" you talked about are about the majority right now in catalonia, everyone now is either independentist or know someone close that is. CiU had to try to ride the tiger the last elections least ERC -which its much more to the point- or even the CUP -which is a no nonsense independence+socialism platform with a strong anticutbacks agenda- bleed them dry of independentist voters. Now the moderates vote esquerra while the radicals vote the cup, or just go to the grassroots movements (like the ANC). Wrapping up; nobody cares about catalonia independence: off course, we are a small country, unlike scotland and england, spain gives us no recognition at any level, we had no noticeable armed struggle, and as i told you, by now, the catalans are the ones that must care about catalonia and if we manage to establish a catalan republic that finally stands (unlike in the XVII, XIX and XX centuries) then we will have all the time in the world to get other peoples to know us better. 

I also think that catalonia's case it's quite different than quebec or scotland for another reason; Catalonia is the only one among those three which was attacked by the state that theoretically had to protect her; the generation that suffered the bombings, rapes, assassination and torture is still alive. I really can't imagine the canadian or british army massacring it's own population and forcing them to live under a fascist regime for 40 bloody years. The british banishing the scots kilt, the traditional log cutting and running events of the highlands? The spanish military dictators even banished the Sardana (catalan national dance), banished the language (Schools,98% published books, street names, people names, towns names, newspapers, etc etc etc all of it had to be in spanish), and just plainly acted as thoroughly as they could to eliminate the catalan identity by all the means at their disposal. Fascist spain was on for 40 years, 40. Hitler only got like 18 to 20, and thye italians got about 22. That's entire generations all around spain brainwashed by fascism and the catholic church. There's much to be talked about all of this, and i'll be delighted to, but i was getting off toppic so i better leave it at that for now

Nordrhein-Westfalen is one of those lovely states without Studiengebuehren, so you can enroll in a university pretty much for free as long as you qualify. You don't even necessarily have to take classes, although I managed to take a whole bunch of philosophy courses while working.

Along with the advantages of being a student are the Semesterticket, which (depending on the university) allows you unlimited public transportation for super cheap; the ability to eat at the Mensa (think SchniPoSa for ~3 Euros); discounted rates for movies, museums, plays, concerts, and just about everything else; and finally the ability to live in comfortable subsidized student housing.

true,skltntoucher,null,null,"Like I said somewhere in the comments, I lived in Bulgaria for a few years - at first because I had to, but then because I didn't want to leave (HEJA TARNOVO!), and here are the observations that I have off the top of my head:

- Bulgarians are very proud of their history and for very good reasons. They never lost a flag in a war!
- It's one of the oldest countries in Europe (est. 681?), so the historical and cultural heritage is enormous.
- Created the Cyrillic alphabet.
- Bulgarian is one of the most confusing languages I've had to deal with, but it makes so much sense once you figure it out.
- That makes for great poetry and literature. (Dalchev, Yavorov, Raztsvetnikov, Slaveykov and many, many others)
- Music-wise, half of what they make isn't worth a fart, the other half you can't stop playing.
- Biggest exporter of rose oil (about 70% of the worldwide production, I think)
- Almost no one under 40 speaks Russian or likes Russians, contrary to the popular belief.
- Even though it used to be a communist state, it never really was a part of the USSR. People are still trying to shake off communism, even though some still seem to want it to come back.
- Stopped the muslim invasion of Europe (I think in the 8th century? Not sure though.)
- Have their own currency - the Lev (the BGN to EUR exchange rate is 2:1).
- Everybody owns a house. Young people leave their parents' house quite late.
- Used to make Renault cars, now they make Great Wall and motor trucks.
- Despite that, the industry is still dying.
- Excellent upper-mid class resorts - both ski/mountain and beach.
- Speaking of that, gorgeous nature.
- People are mostly closed-minded, prejudiced and a bit racist. I'm not defending them but it's somewhat understandable - the only black people they have are brazillian football players and have had problems with muslims in the past. However, once you've earned their trust, religion and colour don't matter the tiniest bit. And with more young people spending time abroad now (student work and travel programmes to the USA and the UK are becoming really popular), they're getting used to different cultures and are becoming less prejudiced and open-minded.
- Force to be reckoned with in volleyball. Football seems to be getting there too on international level, but their domestic league is crap.
- Great at chess!
- Yogurt, rakia and white cheese everywhere. Tried to patent rakia a few years ago (in competition with Serbia and Croatia?) but as far as I know the serbs got it.
- Home-made wine, despite ridiculously low alcohol prices.
- Everyone grows their own fruits and vegetables in the villages and smaller towns.
- They say the inventor of the first computer was Bulgarian.
- It's okay to spend 5 hours at a pub or a café drinking beer or coffee on a Tuesday morning.

That's all I can think of for now. I also want to use the chance to once again thank Bulgaria and its people for the fantastic years that I had there.

This, however, is about the NSA hacking into the network infrastructure of SWIFT. It's a *Man in the Middle* attack that supposedly happened even without the knowledge of SWIFT.

The difference is that this time, nobody outside of the NSA has any knowledge about what kind of information the NSA has been sifting through.

No, we were not talking about an hypothetical secession of Catalonia. We were talking about the upcoming Diada and its international significance, which is, like it or not, none. Sure, a Catalonian secession would be a huge event for everybody in western Europe... were it to actually happen any time this century (I'm sure we'll get to discuss this in depth in but a few days).

I have a huge respect for CUP, problem is you guys are probably going nowhere. You are trying to be the Catalonian Bildu but you're not and, I shouldn't have to point this out, Catalonia is not the Basque country. ETA and its prosecution by the Spanish state radicalised the Basque separatist movement, meanwhile in Catalonia you have a very comfortable middle-class that boasts their independentism while voting CiU because, even if you guys hug the senyera as firmly as everybody else, you're still communists and ERC is a much more pragmatic and sensible choice.

I hope my words harm independentism because truth is supposed to hurt. I have no doubt the catalonian separatist movement is a grassroot one, so is the 15M, but guess which one has its supporters beaten to a pulp by the Mossos every time there is a demonstration. I suppose there is a difference then between waving an estelada and asking for social justice. I hope you don't think it's a coincidence that Catalonia and the Basque Country, both regions with a strong industrial high bourgeoisie  that actually prospered during Franco's dictatorship and with more than enough reasons to want more power for themselves, have such healthy separatist movements while Galician, Andalusian or even Canarian independentists remain in the political fringe. Please.

And this is what saddens me so much about the leftist Catalonian separatist movement. When I bump into one of you guys I'm always amazed at how clearly they see the situation in Spain: the PP is the political arm of the Spanish oligarchy, they use La Roja and other blatant expressions of nationalism to distract people from the real problems, mainstream media works for the capital... but the moment you suggest that the same thing happens in Catalonia with CiU, la senyera and TV3 they get mad and point out how we mesetarios don't understand what's happening in Catalonia.

Socialism and nationalism are not as compatible as you may think. ERC, when presented with the choice, chose nationalism and supported CiU. That's what a flag does to you. Be careful, bro, I'd hate to see you CUPcakes go down that path as well.

&gt; the generation that suffered the bombings, rapes, assassination and torture is still alive. I really can't imagine the canadian or british army massacring it's own population and forcing them to live under a fascist regime for 40 bloody years.

I know you mean well so I won't get angry at you. Next time you think about using this argument please remember the rest of Spain suffered those 40 years as well (with bombings, rapes, assassinations and torture) and suggesting that Catalonia got it worse than other regions is going to piss a lot of people off. And rightfully so. But we'll discuss this another time!

Everybody and their dog in the UK now knows about the ""shaking your head to mean yes and nodding for no"", thanks to some advert on the TV recently, but it's not quite that simple. A nod of the head for ""no"" is not the same nod that I would use for ""yes"". It is a short upward nod, not nodding up and down. If you go to a touristy area, they will expect you to be nodding/shaking in a non-Bulgarian manner. If you are attempting to ""fit in"", be sure to verbally accompany your shake or nod with a Да (da) or Не (nay) to avoid confusion.  
Unlike their northern neighbour Romania, there was no execution of Todor Zhivkov, their leader during the days of socialism. I think he was imprisoned, but there was no bloody coup or civil war.  
Older Bulgarians still seem to remember the socialst days with a keen nostalgia, and I was quite surprised to encounter quite so many who thought Stalin was damned good guy. This seems to be particularly the case in smaller towns who once had full employment and factories or breweries, and now find themselves sidelined by bigger towns with better infrastructure and/or investment.  
Gypsies are a subject of conversation that the typical liberal will find difficult. They are almost universally despised in Bulgaria. Many do not speak Bulgarian to a high standard (I have been told I speak Bulgarian like a gypsy by the in-laws, as I fail to pronounce some words properly or conjugate a verb incorrectly). There are also the ""Grey Pigeons"" in some parts of Bulgaria, or ""Old Bulgarians"" as they may be referred to. These people are not actually Romani gypsies, and they speak ""proper"" Bulgarian, but are sometimes classed as another subset of gypsy. They are better liked than ""actual"" gypsies.  
Bulgaria spent many years under Ottoman rule, and this is sometimes a sore point. They celebrate Vasil Levski who organised a movement against the Ottoman rulers. The word Levski is derived from an old word meaning ""lion"", which is also the currency of Bulgaria (lev/Лев). Another revolutionary in the fight against Ottoman rule is Hristo Botev. In many towns you will find streets named after these men. And whilst I think of it, Bulgarian street addresses are written differently to British streets. Instead of ""57 High Street"" it would be ""Street High 57"". Often the word for street (Улица) is omitted, so you don't live at 55 Vasil Levski Street, you live at Vasil Levski 55. Handy to know when getting a taxi. If you do take a taxi, and you're with a native Bulgarian, let them do the talking or you may end up with a higher fare.  
Sometime in the early 80s, the Bulgarian government opened the border with Turkey, leading to a mass exodus of ethnic Turk Bulgarians. This happenes shortly after the government decreed that everybody must have a Bulgarian (not Turkish) name. Islam was brought by the Ottomans to Bulgaria, and there's still a large Islamic Bulgarian population in some areas, known as ""pomacks"". I'm not sure if every muslim in Bulgaria is referred to under this term, or if that's just for a specific group.  
Macedonia is a point of contention with Bulgaria as much as with Greece. The language is (to me) nearly identical. I think it was on the Slavi show that I saw some ranting about Macedonia claiming some Bulgarian achievements as their own. I upset a Macedonian woman a couple of weeks ago when I asked her (in Bulgarian) if she was from Bulgaria.",0,1378751541,null,0,false,0,cc4xgvb,t3_1m0k9p,t1_cc4xgvb,t3_1m0k9p,null,1429535684,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Ti sorpassano a destra di solito per i seguenti motivi:

* Stai andando con la destra libera e non mostri nessun intenzione a cambiare la tua traiettoria.
* Stavi sorpassando e non sei tornato nella corsia della destra o non sei tornato abbastanza veloce.
* Hai un piccolissimo spazio tra la tua macchina e la macchina sulla destra

tutti tre motivi sono dalla stessa categoria. Menefreghismo. Tuo o del motociclista.

Per quando riguarda ""le strisce"" c'e' ne sono due che posso pensare, una e' quella che separa le corsie nella stessa direzione. Si chiama ""filtering"" o ""lane splitting"" nella cultura anglo sassone, sorry, ma mi sembra che in Italiano si chiama ""andare in moto"". Ed e' assolutamente legale in traffico difficoltoso o rallentato. Il ""perche'"" e' ovvio secondo me. ""Andando"" in moto di mattina, alle 9am, vedo 8 dalle 10 macchine con un posto dai cinque occupati. Io occupo un quarto dello spazio. Posso andarmi fuori dai coglioni a fare cazzi miei e non stare nelle vostre code? o devo partecipare e aggravare la situazione gia' un parecchio triste? Mi sento moralmente autorizzato. Poi c'e' anche il filtering illegale ma qua parliamo ""codice stradale"" e ""buon senso"". Che riguarda anche l'altro tipo delle strisce, quelli che separano la parte della strada dove si puo' andare da quella dove non si puo' (e.g. corsie di emergenza). Perche' vanno su quelli? Beh, per lo stesso motivo per cui non ti sei fermato la ultima volta a cartello ""stop"" o per cui hai accelerato invece di fermarsi d'avanti semaforo giallo. La maggioranza pensa di essere piu' ""fortunati"" e che non li puo' capitare di male. Aggiungi a questo lo scarso sistema di punizione delle violazione stradali e ci siamo.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; To my knowledge -and correct me with evidence if I'm wrong- they have only fired a few tens or hundreds of public servants that have been found guilty of serious wrongdoing (in some cases the 'wrongdoing' took place decades ago; the reluctance to fire even them tells you a thing or two about why the -indeed corrupt- political system that ruled all these years is opting to protect their political clientèle).

Yes, the number of layoffs based on serious wrongdoings is very small (and how could it not be? it's not like you can easily find tens of thousands of people that have committed serious wrongdoings). The reluctance is indeed a sign of corruption but these layoffs are purely symbolic and not really a sign that anything has changed. 

However, there's also quite a large number of layoffs that happened in different contexts. People who did not have a permanent position in the public sector have been fired by the thousands since the beginning of the crisis. Moreover, there has been a number of public services that are ""restructured"" which results to many layoffs in the near future. 

&gt;  You are correct about the pay cuts and the restricting ratio (although it's 1 for 5 retirees, 1 for 10 applies only to public companies) but we were talking about layoffs. 

I'm pretty sure it's 1:10 overall. It used to be 1:5. Maybe I don't remember correctly. Anyway, your greater point was about the cost of the public sector, wasn't it? Why else would we fire civil servants? 

For your second, point, I don't really think the Greek programme put too much weight on raising taxes, to be honest, it seems to me that the difference is mostly due to spending cuts. Are you arguing that if Greece focused solely on cutting expenditure and didn't try to raise any additional tax revenue, then we'd have a similar recovery as Latvia? I'm not that well-versed on Latvia's bailout programme but I doubt it was much different than that of Greece. Can you provide some evidence on this? You must also note that Latvia is a much smaller economy, its initial contraction was smaller, it had no debt problems, different trading partners etc. ",0,1378756566,null,0,false,0,cc4zdzs,t3_1lwqcq,t1_cc4zdzs,t1_cc4t5rc,null,1429534788,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Corporate tax rate (now raised to 26%) too is higher than most, even than those of (way more) competitive economies such as Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and the list goes on and on. Let alone the fact that Greece's EU bottom in the [list](http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings) of ""the ease of doing business"". So if you think that more taxes are necessary for a recovery then I won't argue with that, we simply understand things differently. However, if state expenditure is the way out of the mess as you seem to suggest, doesn't it trouble you that even in 2009, the year with the highest public spending ever, Greece was in recession?

&gt; I'm pretty sure it's 1:10 overall. It used to be 1:5. 

I'm pretty sure the ratio still is 1:5. It only was 1:10 for all the public sector in the first couple of years although the rule wasn't observed ([indicative source](http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_economy_3_04/07/2012_487773)).

&gt; Your greater point was about the cost of the public sector, wasn't it? Why else would we fire civil servants?

Well my underpinning idea was that in order for the state to protect ALL public sector jobs it sought to raise more revenues than the Greek economy could stand (not to mention how just that is or is not). I bet that those laid off in the private sector would kill for one of the public sector jobs even if that meant that the wages wouldn't be as high as they were in good old inflated Greece in 2009.

Ceci dit, faut pas se baser sur le scénario idéal applicable à une poignée d'anglophiles venus de familles aisées - la vaste majorité des élèves n'ont que faire de l'anglais et n'iront jamais vivre dans un pays anglophones. Pour ceux la, l'anglais se limitera à la tv/internet, aux éventuels mails pro de temps en temps, et à commander une bière quand ils sont en vacances. Et a mes yeux, c'est envers eux que les plus gros efforts doivent être faits - relever le niveau global d'anglais a l'échelle du pays est, pour moi, plus important que peaufiner les cursus spécialisés.

&gt;Hungary's next national election could be influenced by voters who have never lived here.


Could be? It will most certainly be. Orbán knows very well that his position is not secure enough in Hungary. He's simply trying to win some ground for himself (note that, not for his party, for himself).

So, lets go over the article, shall we?


&gt;The government says that 480,000 people have applied for citizenship, and thousands have registered to vote, after a 2010 law allowed non-residents with Hungarian ancestry to become citizens and participate in national elections.


Here's the thing. I'm all for helping the Hungarians but this just isn't right. Citizenship, alright. It's more like a gesture anyway, nothing really serious. It's like saying: ""Hey, you're one of us and we haven't forgotten you."" But allowing them to vote? Nah, come on!


&gt;Eighty percent of those eligible to vote in Transylvania – where many of Romania’s 1.2 million ethnic Hungarians reside – said they would support Fidesz in a recent poll.


I know a few dozen people from Transylvania and they are all going to vote for him and there's nothing I can do even though I've tried to talk to them. They say the same as the article:


&gt;“In the mass electorate [in Romania], the perception is that the Hungarian left has betrayed us,” says István Székely, researcher at the Romanian Institute for Research on Ethnic Minorities. Ethnic Hungarians believe Orbán “was the one who gave us the status law, [Orbán] was the one who gave us dual citizenship, while the left has done nothing for us.”


I'll tell you what. Orbán doesn't care about the Hungarian minorities. All he cares about is keeping himself in position. He didn't do this because he was so keen to help them, he did it because:


&gt;The party lost the 2006 election by less than 100,000 votes and the 2002 election by an equally narrow margin. If history repeats itself with a similar close result, Hungarians abroad could tip the scale in Orbán’s favor.


He's not stupid. He and his gang know this better than anyone else. When they lost the election in 2006, I told my family to watch this man because he would go very far to not let this happen again. So here we go.


And finally:

&gt;While dual citizens are able to vote by mail, Hungarian expats must vote in person at an embassy or consulate in their host countries, which could decrease their turnout.


I think this pretty much sums up his intentions. I wouldn't even trust those people at the embassy. I can imagine them opening the letters and changing the votes. I'm not joking. So, if I can't go home at the time I won't be able to vote.",0,1378777740,null,0,false,0,cc57f5c,t3_1m2fzx,t1_cc57f5c,t3_1m2fzx,null,1429531028,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,ultra_violence,NEWZ,New Zealand,"Slippery slope fallacy is generally only a fallacy when used in a formal logic context to make a **conclusion**. It can never be used to PROVE something true or false, but it CAN be used to provide strong evidence for a possible outcome. It CAN be used to PREDICT something.

For example, imagine a frog in a saucepan of cold water. You turn the heat up a little bit and say to the frog, ""it's okay. I only turned the dial a little bit."" Then the water gets a tiny bit hotter. The frog becomes accustomed to the warmish water. Then you turn the heat up a tiny bit more and say to the frog, ""don't worry! I only turned the dial a tiny bit""... and the frog becomes accustomed to the warmer water.

You keep turning up the heat bit by bit, and each time the frog becomes accustomed to the hotter and hotter water.

Until suddenly the water is too hot. And the frog is cooked.

The point is that logically, turning up the heat at each step **doesn't directly kill the frog**. But it makes it much easier to get closer to the point where the frog will be cooked. If you miss a step, the frog will jump out of the water. But if small step by small step you heat the water, the frog will never realise.

That is like the slippery slope. To say *""turning up the heat cooks the frog""*, is LOGICALLY INCORRECT. To say *""turning the dial may be part of a chain of events that cooks the frog""* is LOGICALLY CORRECT.

So slippery slope is not unconditionally a fallacy. It does have it's time and place, but it must be used properly.
