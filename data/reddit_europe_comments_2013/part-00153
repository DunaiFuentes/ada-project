true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"Many people do see the EU government as the most competent, but generally it's because they hear less about them than they do the respective member state governments, and they misconstrue omission for qualification.  Most people will know something bad about domestic politicians, but know little about a foreign MEP or Commissioner, for example.  Doesn't mean it's not there - it means people are getting less of the picture.  Look at the Commission.  These aren't people that are there for winning elections, these are people that have left domestic politics or been made to leave.  Sometimes it's just because they've been duplicitous enough to warrant a reward by some powers that be: case point, Baroness Ashton.  Never won an election, no relevant experience, no real public figure or diplomatic experience.  Put in charge of the EU Foreign Office!  Look at Peter Mandelson, shamed out of public office and into resignation twice in the UK so they sent him to Europe where he was less accountable.  Had one of the most powerful jobs as Trade Commissioner.  Rumpoy was a watered down compromise by most sides, Barosso came to power on the basis of  bailing from a landslide domestic defeat because he'd stalled the economy.

So the calibre in the Commission tends to be much lower, but look at the record.  18 years they've never signed off their records with the auditors.  They were warned about the currency problem and the currency crisis hit.  When they tried to put through a constitution and it failed they ignored the result and actually formed an enabling treaty!  They have closed ballots, there is a democratic deficit, the budget has gone up every year, there has been more legislation passed in the last 25 years than in a thousand years of European history.  Where as the US however has maintained its market share of the global economy as the emerging economies have appeared the EU has continued to shrink since the concept of the EEC.  There is a democratic deficit.  It's inflexible to change and reform; for 20 years the CFP has been trying to stop dumping fish, even the CFP itself says it needs drastic reform.  They announced in 2013 that they had finally secured some meaningful reform, and then announced but they couldn't try to stop dumping before 2020!  The same story goes on and on.

How do you compete without protectionism?  Same as every successful free market economy has ever survived and prospered.  You adapt and address the demand/skill set.  African beef is not about to take over British beef, nor is French wine about to lose out to Chinese rice wine.  The products European farmers can produce are not all the same as farmers outside.  Yes African farmers will be able to produce grains and lentils cheaper than what EU farmers can, but then EU farmers have cash crops open to them which the African farmers do not.  30 years ago we'd have asked the same question about how one wheat farmer could stand up to a much larger competitor without using the same herbicides and treatments - now the organic industry is booming.  Whilst one country might be industrialised enough to produce wheat en masse, it might be another that is then able produce and process a carbon negative crop like hemp to produce pharmaceuticals, resins and plastics.  Competition drives development.  China and Russia have all the mechanical expertise to hypothetically challenge the European car industry, with cheaper wages and operation costs, yet Italy and Germany are the ones exporting Ferrari and Mercedes.  It's no different from other areas of industry.  Different economies have different skill sets and can produce different things competitively.  It's when you set up heavy subsidisation and protectionism that development stalls and you fall into inefficient Sovietesq production - because markets have to correct themselves, where governments are loathed to on time.

Even if the protectionism on agriculture wasn't as pronounced.  France for example contributes more to the CAP than it takes out, but benefits most from the protectionism and captured EU market.  France could quite easily pay all its farmers the same subsidies without going through the CAP and countries outside France would simply receive more choice.

Remember, many of the CAP subsidies and tariff reductions end up in the pockets of corporations - it's not just a way of life they're protecting.

&gt; If it weren't Germany or France saying these things then it would be the EU, and who is to say that would make the news any more palatable?

Oh I'm sure if you ask the Mediterranean states if they see the Troika as the tyrant, and understand/see certain prominent EU states working through the Troika.  It doesn't make it more palatable.

I've come to view this as a blessing (and I'm not sure why it would be a requirement for unity or cooperation in the first place — we seem to be doing fine with this Tower of Babel approach we're currently using).

Having separate languages means that each language area will have a separate public discourse. It means that the 'context' of public debate is always rather limited, which is a *great* thing, because it makes public debate more accessible to the individual — even more so in the smaller language areas.

Compare this with the US, where new political parties need a national foothold to be considered relevant — it's rare that a new movement gains traction in one state and then moves to the next, and each state doesn't have a separate ""take"" on the matter, the way that European, say, social democrats all do.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I see. The reference to inflation rates was due to having a common currency masking competative divergence (as mentioned in that youtube video). However, do you think these problems could have been identified earlier with propper auditing and transparency in government?

If wage inflation in Germany would have been higher then that would have meant that German exports to US and China would have decreased, leading to lower employment in Germany and increasing the rate of outsourcing of work from the country, largely to developing world. 

What people who bring up the inflation differentiations keep always forgetting is that we live in a global world. For example my wage increases have largely went to buy more from US, China and Japan, only a small part of my increased money has went to consuming products from southern Europe.

When we talk about competition, it is not southern countries vs. Germany, but southern countries vs. China. We live in a global economy and have to compete globally.

&gt; As for 'injections into their economies', private investors do not tell greeks to sell government bonds, that is up to their government to issue them. This comes back to propper transparency and auditing to align risk correctly rather than 'forcing countries to issue bonds', which is what an 'injection of capital' seems to imply.

The financial catastrophe that both Greek and Cypriot states caused could have been largely prevented with proper transparency and auditing, but even that may not be enough. You may still have electorate that refuses to acknowledge reality, for example Italians have time after time again continued to elect politicians that promise them everything and join them on refusing to deal with deteriorating situation.

In case of Spain and Portugal, this is also true, even thought their economies are hurting more due to increased competition from developing countries. The state has very well known how bad the situation, but politicians haven't engaged to fix problems. I for example remember a lecture from a senior official from Finnish bank, he told that they had foreseen the current troubles that our forest industries have already in the 70s, and it was just luck that those developments didn't start then when they made their estimations.

The problem isn't that there wouldn't be knowledge on how things are and where they are going, the problem is acknowledging that and starting to act based on that assessment.",0,1374915009,null,0,false,0,cbbats8,t3_1j2rnk,t1_cbbats8,t1_cbbae26,null,1430314358,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Not a long time ago in Italy there were many many different languages. Italian language was used only as written form by some elites. Now we all speak Italian and what you're prospecting isn't happening. Actually politics in Italy is a mess where nobody agrees on anything. It's composed by many movements and parties. When they try to create a big coalition after a while it splits into different groups. Lobbies here have not the power they have in USA. That depends more by how you finance the political campaign.

true,did2,null,null,"In Cádiz, if you are interested in flamenco, check out La Perla de Cádiz - they host a flamenco competition with shows almost every weekend.  In fact, I think the final might be coming up soon.  Just be aware that the venue fills up very quickly - I recommend you arrive 30 minutes to an hour in advance, and just grab a beer and some food to pass the time until the show starts.  If La Perla doesn't have any events while you're in town, you can also check out La Cava - it's much more touristy but still a good show.

The center of Cádiz nightlife during the summer is probably along the Paseo Marítimo near the Hotel Playa Victoria.  Bars like Tobba, Buccan, Onside/Offside, Islazul.  Also check out the street just behind the Paseo Maritimo (Muñoz Arenillas), but that tends to be a slightly younger crowd.  For late-night nightclubs, the most popular seems to be La Posada de Babilonia.  And as long as you're there in summer, definitely visit one of the many beach bars (chiringuitos)

Aside from that, visit the Torre Tavira - if you've never visited a camara oscura before, it's a very interesting experience, and it gives you the best view of the city.  Alternatively, you can climb the west tower of the cathedral for a small fee.  Another place I enjoy visiting in the center is a small bodega called La Manzanilla on Calle Feduchy - you can try typical Cádiz sherry wines and the owner may be able to explain to you the sherry winemaking process if he isn't too busy.  Very cool place.

Restaurants: my favorites are Balandro, Avenida 28, Granja Santa Ana, El Beato, Cumbres Mayores.  There are a couple fantastic Argentine restaurants that I love: Meson de las Americas and La Abuela Elfrides.  For paella/arroz try La Marea (most typical) or Arrocería La Pepa (most variety).  If you don't know any Spanish and have never tried Spanish food, try El Arte Serrano - they have a menu in English and with pictures.  There is a tiny nondescript Spanish bar on Pintor Zuloaga called Casa Cristo which has the most amazing meatballs.  And for typical Cádiz fried fish, try Las Flores (with locations in the center and near Hotel Playa Victoria).

How to behave?  If you don't want to look like a tourist, refrain from wearing shorts except at the beach.  Otherwise, don't worry too much about it - Cádiz is packed with tourists in the summer, no one cares.

I'm not Christian, but really, that Cross never bothered me. Also, if a class has a majority of non-Christian students the Cross has to be removed (I think someone sued some time ago).

I'm pretty sure that the whole prayer thing is about to become extinct. I remember that we went to church on the first day of elementary school (which was kinda awkward) but even that stopped after my first year. We never had any prayers. Maybe that's still a bit different in more religious, rural environments.

Relating to the *Konkordat*: No, it is *not* part of our Constitution. Most of the privileges of the Catholic Church (or probably all of them) are granted to the other legally accepted religions (*gesetzlich anerkannte Religionsgemeinschaften*) since the state has to treat them equally.

You do know that French, German and Norwegian are all Indo-European languages? They resemble each others quite much compared to for example Finno-Ugric languages (Finnish and Eesti) or to Basque, another Indo-European language. From my point of view, there really isn't much value on creating yet another Indo-European language and trying to use it. The fact of the matter is that English is lingua franca of today's world and we need to use it no matter what because rest of the world uses it, so why not use it in internal communications too.

Another thing is that people can learn languages if they need and want to. I speak fluent English, can speak with Swedish and German, and will next start to learn Russian.

I wasn't talking about the internal information in Italy, but what we get to know about the other countries in the EU. Though sometimes it looks like the only problem with media in the world is Italy and Berlusconi. For example in UK there a lot of media are owned by Murdoch and in the past he used them to push the war in Iraq. There was also a phone hacking scandal. Stuff that was pretty heavy. Though I never hear about the terrible corrupted British media. 

I couldn't make an example about your country because I don't speak your language. I can't access to your local news and as you can see this separate me from you in a cultural sense. I'm sure in many other countries in Europe they know very little about what's going on in Norway. Having different languages is dividing us.

&gt;Every European army is capable of using English for international cooperation. This isn't an issue.

International cooperation between different countries is not like having a common single European defense and for that yes language is a barrier.
If you think we're fine like we're right now it's useless to talk about EU integration.

true,provied,ASTR,Austria,"&gt; Many people do in fact see the Cross in public buildings not as a symbol of religion or even dominance of Christianity but rather some kind of cultural thing

This is something I just can't understand. As Austrians, we have a rich tradition and many things we can be proud of, but I can't see what a religious symbol has anything to do with it. Better hang up a violin or some mozart balls in there! For me, the cruzifix in classrooms just expresses a dominance that is no longer justified. (And I'm not sure about the removing thing! But even if it is removed in such situations, that changes nothing imo as long it is still up in all other classes)

And I acknowledge that I used the wrong word with constitution, it is more a contract between our state and the vatican (which is a good thing, so some future politicians can tell them GTFO. But we probably have to wait for the ÖVP to disband ...)

&gt;Most of the privileges of the Catholic Church (or probably all of them) are granted to the other legally accepted religions

And this is another problem I have with our situation. I don't want the Islam or fucking Jehova's witnesses to have the same privileges. I want all of them to be a private thing and have no state-granted privileges at all. I mean, even the Jehova's witnesses have a right to a *state-paid* religion class at school, all while ethics is still not an official school subject.

Of course ""blow the scale"" is a bit exaggerated, but imo we are far away from a separation between state and religion and there are states with more religious people that are miles ahead in this issue.

No, this would be great -- if it replaced the national equivalents.

Intelligence agencies such as NSA, GCHQ or BND, which collect signal and communication intelligence, usually operate under guidelines that assume all foreign signals passing its sphere of influence are fair game, while they (should) have strict limits on collecting communication of their own citizens. The way it is now, GCHQ can collect information about Germans, BND can collect information about Brits, and then they ""cooperate"". If they were replaced (not just augmented) by an EU agency, this issue would be solved, and intra-European communications would be subject to a lot less surveillance than they are today.

It is conservative when it comes to preserving a part of the Latin declension system or the neuter gender, it's innovative in other aspects.

---
&gt; It was the famous beggar thy neighbour approach, without any possibility to retaliate. It was the unique historical situation, that Germany could use that it was by coincidence in a currency union at the time when it went for a neo-classical experiment of cutting wages, that it could be successful on the external side. This will never be repeated in the next, say, 200-300 years. No country will ever go into a currency union with a country that at the same time follows such a mercantilist approach. It would be absolutely foolish to do that. 

---
&gt; If you compare Spain and Germany you see that it cannot be a budget/deficit/debt crisis in the first round that is responsible for the trouble in Europe. No, it's a combination of being unable to deal with these external balances because of the currency union and the inability, or the unwillingness, of the countries to follow the commonly agreed inflation target inside the monetary union. A monetary union is a union in which countries give up the possibility of having national inflation targets. If you have an international commonly agreed inflation target and a country deviates sharply, then you're getting into trouble that can never end. 

---
&gt; For countries like Spain and Italy, with an export share of 25% of GDP, it is absolutely impossible to get out of the slump by cutting wages. That is what we ask the countries to do, beyond the cutting in public expenditure. We're asking them to cut wages to improve their competitiveness. But if you have a gap of 25%, even if in the first 2, 3 years you are able to cut wages by 20%, you will not reach Germany in terms of the absolute level of competitiveness, but you will have destroyed your domestic market fully. 

&gt; This is what has been happening and it is politically infeasible. You cannot destroy your domestic market and tell people ""In 3 years time, if you cut another 20%, then we will reach the level of competitiveness that will get us out of the slump"", without knowing what the surplus country will do, without having any conditionality on the surplus country to accept a massive reduction of their surplus. It's the other way around: Germany defends its surpluses by all means. Even in Brussels, in the Sixpack, they defended their position and they're not even scrutinised, not even analysed, as long as they have 6% of GDP as surplus. Whereas the deficit countries are facing sanctions already at a much lower level. 

&gt; So this does not work, it cannot work, because you're destroying domestic demand in Southern Europe (including France), you're not stimulating domestic demand in Germany so what you get is a slump in overall demand, for the whole of Europe and you get no way out of the problem. If you do it the other way, if you ask the surplus country to do much more for stimulating demand, by letting wage increase in a normal way, by stimulating domestic demand by fiscal policy. If you do it this way, then you have a chance that the Southern European countries get stimuli from these quantitative effects and if at the same time they are going to moderate their wage increases then they are going to improve their competitiveness, not quickly but over a long period of time. 

---
&gt; We're facing in the European Union a transfer problem. The same kind of problem that Keynes described in his warnings about the reparations that the allies after the WW1 put on Germany. It's exactly the same kind of transfer problem: We are asking deficit countries to pay back their debt but at the same time Germany prevents them from paying back their debt. If you do not allow them to get into surplus positions in the current account, then they will never be able to pay back their debt, that is just a question of logic, of bookkeeping. If you do not allow them to pay back their debt by blocking the market share gains on their side, if you try to defend your surplus position, then you're putting them into a situation where the only way out is sovereign default or opting out of the currency union. This has to be understood. If we're not starting to understand this in Europe, then we'll never understand why the Euro will have failed in 5 or 10 years time.

They were discussed and planned in 2006 by the Labour government and given the go-ahead.

*[From the Wikipedia article:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_Cards_Act_2006)*
&gt;Many of the concerns focused on the databases underlying the identity cards. The Act specified **fifty** categories of information for each each citizen, including up to 10 fingerprints, a digitised facial scan and iris scan, current and past UK and overseas places of residence of all residents of the UK throughout their lives, and indexes to other Government databases (including National Insurance Number) – which would have allowed them to be connected. The legislation on this resident register also said that any further information could be added at a later date.

Then in 2009 they were given to people who asked for one (I believe the uptake was understandably low). Although they were planned to be mandatory it never got to that stage.

They were scrapped completely in 2010 when the Conservative/LibDem coalition came to power. Those ID cards are now no longer valid in the UK.

*[From the Home Office website:](https://www.gov.uk/identity-cards-and-new-identity-and-passport-service-suppliers)*
&gt;Under the terms of the Identity Documents Act 2010, identity cards ceased to be legal documents on 21 January 2011. The government introduced the Identity Documents Act 2010 which received royal assent on 21 December 2010. The act brings into law:

&gt;the cancellation of the UK national identity card;

&gt;the identification card for EEA nationals;

&gt;the provision for the destruction of the National Identity Register;

&gt;Your identity card ceased to be be a valid legal document for confirming your identity on 21 January 2010.

When formal identity is needed people use their driving licenses or passports.

For simple stuff like proving age there is an ID card scheme - but it can only be used for stuff like buying alcohol or getting into pubs; for official (police etc) purposes you would need to produce your passport/drivers license. 

There is no legal need to carry ID with you in the UK.

&gt; In 1991, the former head of France’s foreign intelligence service admitted that France had spied on US technology companies that competed with French rivals. It was noted, then, that “France has long been among the most aggressive users of espionage to collect foreign industrial and technological secrets” – perhaps second only to Japan. This included allegations of bugged seats on Air France. In 1992, another former CIA director, Stansfield Turner, noted that “the French are the most predatory service in the world now that the old Soviet Union is gone”.

[Reference #2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_espionage#France_and_the_United_States)

&gt;Between 1987 and 1989, IBM and Texas Instruments were thought to have been targeted by French spies with the intention of helping France's Groupe Bull.[37] In 1993, US aerospace companies were also thought to have been targeted by French interests.[38] During the early 1990s, France was described as one of the most aggressive pursuers of espionage to garner foreign industrial and technological secrets.[37] France accused the U.S. of attempting to sabotage its high tech industrial base.[37] The government of France has been alleged to have conducted ongoing industrial espionage against American aerodynamics and satellite companies.

&gt;In 1993, car manufacturer Opel, the German division of General Motors, accused Volkswagen of industrial espionage after Opel's chief of production, Jose Ignacio Lopez, and seven other executives moved to Volkswagen.[13] Volkswagen subsequently threatened to sue for defamation, resulting in a four-year legal battle.[13] The case, which was finally settled in 1997, resulted in one of the largest settlements in the history of industrial espionage, with Volkswagen agreeing to pay General Motors $100 million and to buy at least $1 billion of car parts from the company over 7 years, although it did not explicitly apologize for Lopez's behavior.[40]

&gt;But back in 2011, according to leaked U.S. diplomatic cables, France and not China or Russia, was found to be the country that conducted the most industrial espionage on other European countries. WikiLeaks also revealed that the spying network was so widespread that “damages it caused the German economy were larger as a whole than those caused by China or Russia.”

Next time go with Lithuania or Slovakia or something like that.

Or the Spanish basketball team with the ""racist photos in Beijing"", I still haven't found a Chinese source from mainland China complaining about it, unlike with Asian Americans.

Another difference is that Americans talk about ""confidence"" as if it is something almost quantifiable. I am not sure about the rest of Europe (though I think it's the same) but where I live if you go lecturing people on ""confidence"" everyone's going to think you've lost it.

Finally the NFL (I actually like it as a sport though not as much as football/soccer). You can see it from the way certain TV networks cover it that for some people it's more than a sport, it's like a festival of ""patriotism"". TV network 1 (Fox Sports iirc) will have like, stats, videos of athletes doing intense warm ups etc., it will look like some tough high performance track and field coverage. 

Then network 2 (NBC) will have intro videos with country singers in front of the White House, fireworks shooting, soldiers saluting, trucks or something, that's like 100% different from how the Champions League (with the classical music etc)  is presented.

In terms of equipment, some things need to be slowly removed, like the Ariete and the Abrams. Slowly replace them with a more common tank like the Leopard. For an APC/IFV take something like the Swedish CV90 or the German Boxer. 

Air force is a bit more tricky. The most simple thing would be for all nations to adopt the Eurofighter, but i don't see the French and the Swedish giving up on Dassault and Saab. This might actually be a good thing. The US Air Force also employs a wide range of planes for different roles. Let Saab, Dassault and EADS cooperate and provide Europa with a sufficient air force.

The combined European Navy would be the biggest navy in the world, with 66 Guided Missle Ships, 58 Submarines and 4 Aircraft Carriers it is a force to be reckoned with. I don't think there has to be much change in this area, European navies already cooperate much, so further integration should be a little bit easier then with the other branches.

In terms of size it should probably number a good 700k men and woman. Its main role should be to protect Europe while still being able to maintain the peace around the globe if needed. Nuclear weapons is more of a personal opinion. They are a useful deterrence but not really needed.  


Please note that the above is a personal ''analyse'' of an armchair general and it would probably only work in an European Federation of some sort.

 This wouldn't work in the current Union because the member states have different interests. If a military coup occurs in Suriname, do you really think that Danish marines would be willing to go in because the Netherlands want to?

It would be as if California and New York controlled the entire military of the United States.

I mean, the ISAF has worked together pretty well in Afghanistan, and Eurocorps, the European Gendarmerie Force and EU Battlegroups still need to be heavily worked on, but they show that the political will and vision for multinational units in the EU is there, even if their mettle has yet to be tested. Decades of NATO cooperation doesn't hurt either.

But I do agree on your point about languages. Standards and equipment can be easily modified, but a common language is pretty vital and a lot harder problem to deal with in a union as diverse as the European Union.

Besides that, you'll definetly want [Ketchup](http://www.heinzketchup.de/Products/Ketchup/Tomato-Ketchup-1170-ml) and [spiced Ketchup](http://www.helafood.eu/de/24/kat:33/art:403/st:5/hela-curry-gewuerz-ketchup-delikat.html). I recommend getting the named brands, because they are quality products and taste great.

When it comes to [mayonaise](http://www.thomy.de/Produkte/Mayonnaise/default.htm?id=11807271&amp;action=detail) and [mustard](http://www.thomy.de/Produkte/Senf/default.htm?id=11807341&amp;action=detail) i'd always go with Thomy. Also they do the best [remoulade](http://www.thomy.de/Produkte/Remoulade/default.htm?id=11807291&amp;action=detail)!

Okay, but now to get to your question: Is BBQ sauce a good gift? 

I tried the Jack Daniel's Sauce and it's great! But as stated before, BBQ sauces aren't that often seen on german BBQs. I'd still go for it, since it's great and people can try it out!

Besides the sauces, you'll definetly want good meat on the grill. Also, in germany you generally bring your own meat, so go to a lokal butcher (Metzgerei) and to get good quality. If you don't know any, go to your local REWE and get the Wilhelm Brandenburg Brand Meat, it's great too!

Also bring a sixpack of beer with you!



Okay, now where at the BBQ, having a great time with your beers and friends and the meat gets off the grill. If you're not native german, you can easily be confused by the varieties. Here are some combinations that work well:

- Mustard / Ketchup (spiced too or curry) goes with white sausages (pork)

- Mildly spicy sauces and Ketchup go well with red sausages (beef)

- Generally you can eat every sauce with pork and beef steaks

- Chicken and other birds go well with curry sauces and some people like mayonaise with it. 

Also, bring a baguette with you to eat with your meat and (if you are at least 10) you should bring something for everyone else, like a [Nudelsalat](http://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/35541011883951/Nudelsalat.html) or [Kartoffelsalat](http://www.genial-lecker.de/archiv/rezepte/salate/kartoffelsalat/)",0,1374938156,null,0,false,0,cbbegps,t3_1j52kp,t1_cbbegps,t3_1j52kp,null,1430312661,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

The application of unique rules to Jewish State is the opposite of lawful.

&gt; This is about EU foreign policy, not international law. And that is what makes it so distressing. **The EU’s exclusionary and discriminatory actions against Jews in the Middle East are not an unfortunate step compelled by laws and norms; they simply want to do it.** From time to time the EU will attempt to portray its actions as upholding justice and the law.

In that regard, I would, however, like to see the de-institutional of NATO, to the point that it's merely a Mutual Defense Pact instead of the bureaucracy it's become. I think such a move would help put a fire under any plans to construct an actually effective E.U. Military, if not out of nothing, but necessity. This would also go a long way towards negating the post of NATO Supreme Commander and supplementing with a more influential European one, and one, possibly replacing it all together.

I mean, don't get me wrong, Britain and France have strong militaries, but the fact that two of Europe's strongest military players still required logistical and intelligence support from my country for what is, basically, regional power projection, should say a lot. 

They can't alone carry Europe on their back. And with my country's *""pivot to the pacific""*, more and more of that burden is placed on their shoulders each day. Europe needs to step up it's game and implement proportional military spending, and a united, cohesive military, if they want the E.U. to possess any kind of effective ""hard"" power. And I don't mean that in a war-mongering way. Europe is bordered by Africa and the Middle East, not two of the most stable regions, and France alone gets much of it's uranium from Africa *(which IIRC, nuclear power supplies much of their country)*, so maintaining stability there is very important to them. This isn't even mentioning the hornet's nest that's smack dab in the middle of Europe, the Balkans, or the fact that Russia still lingers on the E.U.'s peripheries, and still considers many of it's Eastern European members to still be inside it's area of influence.

Now, the Deutsche Welle site can be a little confusing but I managed to figure it out. Press Learn German on the top of the page, then click B1, and then click on Deutsch Interaktiv and START NEW COURSE. From there a new window should pop up. Sign up as a new user and start learning B1. You can also take the placement test to see how well you do.

This is supposed to go hand-in-hand with the TPP *(Trans-Pacific Partnership)*, a free trade agreement not unlike the one we're proposing with the European Union.

I don't think it'll escalate to Cold War-level tension, because like you said, China and my country rely on each other too much. But, in my personal opinion, it is good to be prepared. And you can hardly blame us really. With the huge territorial claims China is putting out *(the widespread nationalist support for these claims by it's citizens doesn't really help much either)*, which infringes on the territory of not only Japan, but of South Korea and the Phillipines as well *(all major U.S. allies)*, it's no wonder we're doing what we're doing. 

We have mutual defense pacts with both Japan and South Korea *(we might have one with the Philippines as well)*, we're **required** to defend them. China keeps provoking them and poking them with a stick, so we have to prepared to fullfill our commitments, for better or for worse. We can't just abandon them. Half the time I think they do it to gauge our reaction and see if we're really willing to defend them, and I think the pivot makes it pretty clear we are for the foreseeable future. 

I mean hell, for example, Vietnam is one of the most Pro-U.S. countries in the world right now. **Vietnam**. Specifically because of China's territorial claims which infringe on their border *(well...that and Vietnam has always been the smart one and played the big people off against each other to preserve their independence)*. 

But, just to tell you, the official U.S. line that Obama is giving is that the pivot has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with China, and is in no ways meant to deter or contain them.

Cette phrase de MauvaisConseil résume parfaitement les faiblesses rhétoriques d'Asselineau, qui oublie cette donnée fondamentale. Le discours de l'UPR oublie toujours ceci : les décisions sont prises en fonction de l'intérêt de ceux qui les prennent. En l'occurrence, au lieu de servir les États-Unis, l'Union Européenne sert les entreprises européennes. Qu'on soit d'accord : elle ne sert pas les entreprises américaines (sauf en cas évident d'intérêt commun) ; elle ne sert pas plus les populations européennes.

Nous sommes dans une logique commerciale d'intérêts : certes l'euro était l'intérêt des américains, mais c'était aussi celui des sociétés européennes. D'où sa mise en place. C'est d'ailleurs le cœur des arrangements de la table ronde des industriels européens (ERT). Foucault l'explique très bien dans son débat face à Chomsky, quand il décide de rappeller exactement ce qu'est le pouvoir. (Pour résume : L'ensemble des rapports de force entre A et B qui permettront à A d'imposer sa volonté face à B, ou d'obtenir des compromis l'arrangeant pour que B finisse par faire ce qu'A veut).

These aren't co-operatives.  These are the likes of Tate&amp;Lyle, and the numbers run from there.

It is a fact that the CAP is favouring corporations.  Small farm holdings still get a stake, and that in itself creates more problems in that people are turning acres into subsidised newly planted 'woodland' without actually using it.  It is synonymous.  This isn't protecting distortions.  This is the biggest cats getting the largest cut of the cheese, and a multitude of 'little offenders' getting what they can - but nothing towards actual cost-effective production.

&gt;The democratic deficit is sensasionalised more than it actually is. 

With respect, and knowing that you probably didn't mean it that way, but that's offensive.

The Lisbon Treaty was unreadable as an enacting treaty, they didn't even give time to members to cross reference it before voting on it.  There was a protest because of it.  The Lisbon Treaty has been admitted as a reaction to a readable Constitution that was voted down.  When only Ireland had it in their manifest to vote on it in a referendum (not that they did what would have been honourable and asked for all states to pass it on referendum), they had Ireland vote twice on it - and sent in millions to sway the second vote after the first didn't go their way!

&gt;Commissioners are nominated by democratically elected parliaments of states

Powers are lent to a government, they are not given to then be devolved away.

&gt;The audits are an issue, but this is probably due to strict standards of knowing where every single euro is spent than being an overwhelming problem.

No.  Stop this.  This is you guessing why the audits don't work.  The reason why the audits don't work is because they're not expected to use double entry auditing like any other business is expected to.   

&gt;As for people 'losing their soverenignty' through IMF/EU funding. If these countries don't want to reform, then they don't have to take the money.

It's not just losing sovereignty through that, but if they choose not to take money ----- look at what they do to Cyprus.  It isn't a Common Currency there anymore.  They froze the bankaccounts.  Current and business.  It's not a common currency there anymore.

&gt; If the proposed reforms result in a default or exit from the euro zone

true,stacycreeves,null,null,"I think this is AWESOME and I don't wanna be negative, but I think there are way more rest stops now than in 1982 so this may cause your trip to be far longer than you planned.  We drove from Nice to Paris and there were rest stops every other minute.  Maybe consider mapping it out in advance and counting the rest stops so you can plan ahead and know if you need to change it to every third stop, only the stops that existed in 82 (if you can figure that out - might be a fun thing to add to the trip, ask the staff at each stop how long it has been there).

You should be able to rent a car for around $500.  Just checked on CarRentals.com and a month long rental with pickup in Paris and dropoff in Marseille was $588.  If you can return it in Paris it's only $400.

Getting a cell phone in France is really difficult without a French bank account, and getting a French bank account without a French address is nearly impossible.  If you have friends who live in Paris and have boxes with Orange or SFR, they can get a SIM card added to their plan for only about $5.  You would be leeching off of their minutes and data, but if you keep your usage down it probably wouldn't be that big of a deal.  Maybe you can find someone who will be traveling that month and could let you use their SIM or add a SIM to their account.

Remember, this includes ALL INFORMATION passing through Sweden. So if you have a e-mail that's routed through a Swedish server or call that for some reason has to go through Sweden, it's all tracked. And even then, as specified here, *""experts argue both that it is impossible to differentiate between international traffic and traffic between Swedes and that the oversight by SIUN is not effective enough.""*, so it also provides the means, and excuse, for warrentless domestic wiretapping.

And shall we not forget about the EU-wide [Data Retention Directive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Retention_Directive), which, I remind you, is designed to make E.U. member states store citizens' telecommunications data for six to 24 months.

It takes time. The fact that there is still noticeable segregation and passive racism makes it slower and harder for them to intergrate, when they are forced to live in ghettos and have a hard time finding jobs. Eventually, they will adapt.

we have kind of a funny situation in Denmark in this regard.

Everyone over 18 has a government issued social security card with a barcode and a magnetic stripe. It's not an ID card since it doesn't have a photo or any other kind of biometric information. It's mostly used for publically funded medical expenses and borrowing books at libraries, but in many cases it's accepted as ID anyway (such as when getting a fine for taking public transportation without a ticket or in some cases even taking out loans).

Then we have the electronic ID, NemID. This is used to identify yourself online with and is used for things like reporting your finances (both for yourself and any companies you are in charge of), updating your address in the national registry, filling out electronic forms for marriage and all your banking activity (and everyone *has* to use NemID for banking), but NemID is not one card. It's a two-factor authentication scheme composed of a password and a one-time pad in the form of a cardboard card with a list of numeric challenges and responses.
The system has been heavily critized as insecure because of the authentication scheme, the one-point-of-failure server system and the fact that its client software is written in Java.


You don't automatically receive an ID card, and in fact I've never had one. I've used my passport and driver's license to identify myself when needed.

 - To do your amdministrative formalities from home and relieve you and civil services

 - To ID yourself to third-party service providers like amazon, banks, shops  
  
 - To be able to do legally binding business over the internet and transmit a legally binding signature

In the future they would have seen something like electronic voting systems done with it, but luckily the other ministeries didn't fall for that one, after they were warned how basically impossible that is with current tech. Well, like two days after that thing had been released with a card-reader the CCC hacked it (although they had to have physical access) what kind of lowered the level of trust in the general public to use such a thing. Futhermore there were just no service providers who would adopt the functionalities the passport would provide, because there weren't any people using it. Additionaly to the higher cost of the passport you would have to spend about 150 bucks on a secure card reader. The mail services, which provided legally binding mail, decrypted the mail on the way, thus the chain of encrytion was broken and the businesses discarded that idea.

true,iyh,ITAL,Italy,"Some confusion here and lots of confusion over in /r/worldnews about who she is, what her position is, how she was elected, and why any of this matters. I don't have time to write out an /r/bestof quality post here but I'll summarize. 

Most people I've spoken to in Italy realize she was a token appointee. /u/mick_jones in /r/italy compared her appointment to how lots of women were given secondary positions in the 90s in accordance with equal opportunity. Cécile Kyenge has done well for herself; she's an educated woman who came here on a scholarship to study medicine and ended up becoming an ophthalmologist. A model immigrant. She was granted the opportunity to succeed and worked as a domestic worker upon arrival here to support herself. She works in Italy, pays taxes in Italy, married an Italian, and became an Italian citizen. Not even the most far-right member of the Lega Nord would have any problem with what I said so far. 

Ms. Kyenge eventually decided to get involved in the ""manicomio"" of Italian politics. Anyone in any democratic country who enters the political realm opens themselves up to criticism, some more legitimate than others. Italy is a democratic country but as far as I know, the only country to share our exact political system is Greece. Enough said, right? From the start, Kyenge was elected to a minor role in her adoptive city of Modena as ""the provinical head of international cooperation and immigration"". From there she became involved with Italy's main center-left party, the PD, in the region in which she lives, Emilia-Romagna (historically known as a ""red region"" for being left-wing/communist/anti-fascist). The PD got the most votes this year and when a coalition was finally formed, the new Prime Minister Enrico Letta selected his cabinet with Cécile Kyenge as the Minister of Integration. 

What is the Minister of Integration? What power does he/she have? Other Italians can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly sure it was a new ministerial role created under the past Monti government. Kyenge is only the second ever Minister of Integration. This role is known as a ""ministero senza portafoglio"" meaning she has no actual legislative power herself and mainly serves to advise those who do actually make the laws. I've heard them colloquially called ""ministri a metà"" or ""half-ministers"". [Here's the list](http://www.governo.it/Governo/Ministeri/ministri_gov.html) from the Italian government's website of the ministers and their respective areas. 

You begin to see where the conflict arises. Heavily left-leaning region elects Congo-born woman for immigration positions and she now rises to the national level of politics. She hasn't hidden what she wants to accomplish in her new position; she wishes to pass laws that would grant citizenship to any child born in Italy and in general make it easier to obtain Italian citizenship. Politicians on the right are rightfully worried because this would basically be a generation of voters that predominantly vote left. Ordinary Italians are getting caught in the political crossfire and accused of racism by people halfway across the world who never left their state. 

My opinion on the matter is that illegitimate criticism, such as throwing bananas and saying she looks like an orangutan, is **wrong** and politically short-sighted. By giving ammunition to foreign press, Kyenge's profile is raised and she is handling this remarkably well. A politician making an argument about why new citizenship laws won't help Italy emerge from its economic crisis and will irreversibly change its demographics won't get reported abroad, but a random guy throwing a banana will and has made us all look like idiots.",0,1374959435,null,0,false,0,cbbkwd5,t3_1j5st0,t1_cbbkwd5,t3_1j5st0,null,1430309108,28,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,28

As far as learning Spanish, the most important thing is to make sure all your program courses will be taught in Spanish. That's like 15-20 hours of language instruction a week right there. Outside of class, you will encounter a lot of people who don't want to speak Spanish because a) they would rather speak Catalan, and b) they would rather practice their English. The way to get around that best is to get set up with a language partner situation, so you meet for two hours and spend half in each language. Then, as I said, pick up enough Catalan to show an effort, and almost everyone will meet you halfway, filling the rest in with Spanish.

As for what to do, it depends what you like. The classic must-sees are:

1. Gaudi: Dude was prolific, and his buildings are amazing. Parc Guell is a favorite of mine because it's free, and there's always something interesting happening. It's outside of the city and set on a mountain, so it has great views. La Sagrada Familia, I resisted going to because I was too cool to wait in line with the tourists. When I finally went it was because I was dragged their bitching and moaning about the guiris (tourists), the line, the ticket price, everything, and then I stepped inside and was blown away. Yes it's packed with tourists, but for good reason.

2. Soccer: I love it. I went every chance I got. I sat down in the corners, I sat up in the nosebleeds. I loved every minute of it. I was also there when the team was at it's height of dominance, so that didn't hurt. Even if you don't like the sport, go to a cheap game, as it's an experience.

3. Bars and Clubs: Again, depends entirely on your tastes, but you can find something for sure. This you just kind of have to explore on your own, but the one piece of advice I'd give is to stay away from the beach clubs as they are overpriced and packed with Americans. They just aren't anything you couldn't get in America. Apollo and Razzmatazz are great but are expensive if you don't go on the right night. Nasty Monday at Apollo was my shit.

4. Bo de B: The. Best. Sandwich. Ever. They open randomly, you will wait in line for like 50 minutes. It will be amazing. Unless you don't like having a heaping pile of fresh ingredients on awesome bread, for like 4euro.

5. Beaches, self explanatory.

6. Primavera Sound: If you're there at the end of Spring and willing to drop ~50euro on day passes of ~120euro for four days, it is awesome. Great lineups, in a park by the beach. Stupid fun.

7. Botellon: Grab some friends, grab some booze, make the mildest of efforts to conceal it just in case an officer is feeling dickish, and head to a plaza. Chill and relax.

Con un emendamento proposto dal Movimento 5 Stelle e cui il governo si è affrettato a dare parere favorevole, è stato introdotto nel nostro ordinamento il DURT - Documento unico di regolarità tributaria - che dovrà essere richiesto all'Agenzia delle Entrate (con procedure da terminare con provvedimenti attuativi) dai subappaltatori per sgravare gli appaltatori principali dalla responsabilità solidale per il pagamento delle ritenute fiscali, introdotta l'anno passato. 

La norma aveva gettato nel caos chi lavora nel mondo dell'edilizia: di fatto la norma sanzionava gli appaltatori che saldavano le prestazioni dei subappaltatori senza la preventiva verifica della regolarità fiscale di questi ultimi. L'Agenzia delle Entrate aveva nei suoi interventi di prassi allargato le modalità con cui i secondi potevano testimoniare ai primi la propria regolarità: di fatto era stata ritenuta sufficiente una autocertificazione.

Ma ai grillini tale semplificazione non deve essere piaciuta. La norma prevede la creazione di un apposito portale che dovrà essere creato dall'Agenzia delle Entrate per gli adempimenti connessi al DURT: i provvedimenti attuativi spiegheranno come utilizzarlo.

Questo paese si sta avvitando su se stesso in una spirale senza fine. Il movimento 5 stelle non rappresenta una rottura rispetto al passato. Questo esempio è emblematico. Burocrazia. Burocrazia. Burocrazia.

EDIT: Mi fa notare l'indispettito wedhro come il M5S abbia preso le distanze, dal cittadino Pisano che così presentava il ""suo"" emendamento:

 ""L’emendamento approvato mi vede primo firmatario insieme ai colleghi della commissione Finanze del M5S Barbanti, capogruppo, Villarosa e Pesco che hanno lavorato e condiviso con me il contenuto del complesso testo. Testo realizzato con il competente lavoro del nostro ufficio legislativo""

Homosexuals can't live the lives they want though, their relationships are no different than marriage and thus they should get the same benefit. Being friends with kids that were raised by homosexual couples (either two men or women), these are extremely talented and driven, thus there is no reason to doubt the ability of homosexual marriage to produce the same effect as heterosexual in terms of raising kids - the actual procreation is a whole another beast in terms of logistics, but large number of such couples don't go for surrogacy due to its cost and go for adoption which actually helps as well, considering the number of kids in orphanages.

Being gay is not something you choose, it's something you're born with and in this heteronormative society, it is extremely difficult to come to terms with it and live with it, especially as in Eastern Europe, you are seen as someone who is sick.

In der realen Welt wird der Entdecker von Vulnerabilities juristisch verfolgt, die Sicherheitslücke ignoriert (DEC anyone? GSM?) und der Anwender ignoriert Patches, wenn es die denn mal gibt.

Sorben sind eine anerkannte Minderheit in DE und leben heute in Sachsen und Brandenburg, vor allem in der Lausitz. 

Es handelt sich bei Sorben um Slawen, die schon seit Jahrhunderten dort leben. Das heute Kur-Sachsen (aka das Bundesland) sowie Brandenburg und Mecklenburg-Vorpommern sind ursprünglich slawische Gebiete. Die Germanen siedelten ungefähr bis zur Elbe und eroberten Ostelbien erst unter den Sachsen-Herzögen (Liudolfinger). 
Damals bildete die Elbe ungefähr die Grenze zwischen Slawen und Germanen und die Christianiserung ging erst von Halberstadt und später von Magdeburg aus (-&gt; Lehnin, Brandenburg/Havel) nach Osten in die Ostmark. (Der böhmische Gefreite hatte übrigens keine Ahnung das Ostmark Brandenburg bezeichnet)


Die dort lebenden Slawen wurden im Laufe der Zeit assimiliert, das betrifft die Sorben, die Wenden (-&gt; u.a. Wendland) oder Rujanen (-&gt;Rügen). 

Die Städte Chemnitz, Leipzig und Dresden gehen übrigens auf slawische (sorbische) Siedlungen und Namen zurück. Das auch in Brandenburg verbreitete -witz als Ortsnamen ebenfalls, es geht auf -wicz, Dorf, zurück. 


Stanislaw Tillich ist übrigens Sorbe. 


Ansonsten gibt es im RBB und im MDR sorbische Sendungen im TV, die man auch online sehen und hören kann:

We're still protesting. Today is day 45 (but this subreddit already receives too much spam about it, so I apologize for that).

Protesters managed to block the parliament building ( and it's 1 km perimeter) on Tuesday, trapping 30 MPs and 3 ministers inside. They tried to get out with a huge bus and two armored vehicles, right through the crowd around 10pm. 

Stones were thrown, some windows of the bus were broken, some heads of protesters as well. The bus turned around and went back in the secured perimeter. Some police brutality helped clear a way for the MPs to leave around 4 am in armored trucks.

Was a big story and our protests finally made it to the front pages of most media around the world. The government is still in denial about it unfortunately. 

Honestly, even if there is anything else happening right now here, it's not gonna get much publicity because of the ongoing protests and I guess lots of politically apathetic people are getting sick of it.

It's the height of the summer so a lot of people are on vacations and the news is slow. A law prohibiting loud speakers at protests, expanding police powers to hunt down protesters 2km from where the protests are going on and the fines raised to 4.000 - 21.000 EUR has been proposed and should have been voted on while ""everyone's"" away was thankfully put aside for now, which is surprising.

The president of the largest opposition party claimed at one of his rallies that a silent cue has happened to overturn him ( he's been charged in many cases and has been accused of corruption by the anti corruption commission. Protests followed and then he was impeached ).

- 71st anniversary of the liquidation of Warsaw ghetto

- It's been hot as fuck for a few days. 35 degrees at the moment. The most popular beaches are literally full.

- 41 dehydrated children were admitted to hospital after they had been waiting for several hours for a bus. The police are investigating if their custodians have committed a crime or not.

- A woman left a child in her car, the police broke the windows and saved the child. As it turned out, in the meanwhile the woman was applying for the local Police school. She was fined 500zł.

- When is't not as hot as it is now, storms happen. Some trees have fallen and [some cars were damaged](http://i.imgur.com/FVRWjPZ.jpg), there were power outages and people were injured.

- CCTV operators in Lublin recorded a 14 and 19 years-old drunk girls robbing and beating a couple. They had 1.7 and 1.2 per mills of alcohol in their blood. The older one is facing up to 12 years in prison now.

- A 4-years old was killed by a tree branch(more like stem, really) while posing for a photo for his father.

- A girl, probably drunk, drowned just a few days before Woodstock festival is starting. She got there a few days earlier most likely to get a good camping spot.

- A drunk man was trying to commit suicide in one of the worst ways possible. He, along with his friend(who didn't believe that he was serious about suicide) were driving a car and then suddenly turned left and hit another car, a seat, head-on. The seat driver died, his passengers were injured. The man who tried to 'commit suicide' got off with some minor injuries. He is facing murder and attempted murder charges and is now under arrest. If he is charged with murder he can get from 8 years in prison to life sentence.

- The longest extradosed bridge in Europe was opened this week in Kwidzyn

- A man dug out some ammunition left over from the WWII while working in his garden, approximately 50 artillery shells.

- Another man was found to be in possession of illegal firearms, ammunition and explosives. He is facing up to 8 years in prison.

- A former UB officer(think of Polish Stasi) was charged of using tortures on prisoners in 1946.The Institute of National Remembrance discovered paperwork which proves his guilt and informed the prosecutors office.

- A newly-built tarmac road melted 6 hours after the construction work was done. 

- A woman had murdered a man and left his corpse to rot in her flat. She confirmed killing him.

- A Ukrainian articulated lorry driver crashed into some trees after swerving from one side of the road to another against the flow of traffic. He was drunk.

- From now on people walking after sunset outside of the cities have to wear some reflective elements of clothing.

- A man fell between two tram carts losing both his legs in the process

- A Polish photo reporter was kidnapped in Syria

- The police are looking for a man who raped a 10-years-old boy. They failed to stop him from running away despite firing warning shots

- Two windsurfers saved lives of two sailors who had fell of their boat. Had it not been for them, they would have most likely drowned

- Two criminals went to a police station and admitted stealing some cash because they were afraid of the victim who found out where they lived

- Yet another man was found to be in possession of mortar shells, elements of rifles, pistols and aerial bombs. He dug them out of the ground. 4 of 6 mortal shells had active fuses and could have been set off. It is the second time the dumb ass was arrested for this offence.

- The police have miraculously solved a 21-years-old crime - a murder - by using the newest technology advancements(no details I'm afraid)

- A man who committed a murder 10 years ago was caught by the same unit as the man above (""Archive X"")

- A 26-years-old man who called numerous institutions including hospitals telling them there were bombs on their premises was arrested.

- Our Statistics office wants to count the prostitutes

- The number of storks in Poland is plummeting for unknown reasons

- A man with 7kg of amphetamine was arrested

And how is this mercantilist mindset all over again? You do understand that Eurozone at whole needs to export goods and services in order to import from the rest of the world? If you hinder functioning of German companies what you actually get is worsening trade balance with the rest of the world? In short Eurozone bleeds out money leading eventually to lower standards of living.

No. The problem again in here isn't for example Germany has balanced trade with China, but that troubled economies are lacking in their attempts to export to China and to other non-Eurozone economies.

&gt;  Actually, it happened. A lot of Greek brand products disappeared from Greece. Companies were bought by German ones. You can check the data for yourself: Greece's production base shrunk after adopting the euro. 

How about this, if you claim something, then you inform about it. I'm not going to waste my time trying to prove or disprove what you said. Do your own homework, if you want to discuss, then provide something to talk about.

But hey, regardless of that, have you ever thought why didn't these Greek companies grow up to multinational corporations trading all around the world in their own niche? Why didn't they enlist to NYSE, Nasdaq or LSE get fresh capital and expand?

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"It's both scale and implementation.  There are butter mountains in the EU, they send out bricks of cheese to people that ask for them, yet farmers are still pouring milk down the drain in the streets in protest for how little they get paid by the supermarkets.  It's not being run as an industry or a market.  The Eurozone is in crisis, there's record unemployment, and half the budget is being spent on something which either keeps the cost of food up or farming inefficient!

In Spain CAP money is used to buy tv rights for bullfights.  There is no natural supply and demand, there is no adapt or fail.  They're literally giving an industry a tv show so they have a reason to go on raising bulls.  The tax payer pays for it.  Then they pay for it again when staple produce in their shops cost more.  Then they pay for it again in foreign aid and foreign policy with people in the 3rd world, purposely kept out of a European market.  And all the while we're propping bull fights because if they didn't broadcast them and keep them in the fore of people's minds then people would stop attending.  Gotta keep them desensitised if you want to keep selling bulls for ritual sacrifice...

They're subsidising huge crops which go wasted or unused because that is the EU.  Horrifically inefficient, corrupt, inflexible.  There's a big cash fund that sits in Europe and everybody has a hand in it.  Of course they're not going to give that up willingly.   

The UK's Independence Party came up with a novel way to deal with the subsidies.  Scrap them all over time and allow farmers to promote their produce as British, promote sourcing local produce, and make it easier for farmers to form cooperatives for more bargaining with supermarkets.  If you want cheap bread then you can now buy flour from developing countries trying to build their economies, not being punished by the UKs part in the CAP protectionism.  If however somebody wants organic, really nice bread where the baker can use flour from a field 5 miles away, ground by the miller 3 miles away, and pay a premium - then they can do that too.  If there's demand for localism then the farmer will grow wheat and charge a premium.  If people don't mind where their flour comes from as long as its cheap, the local farmer will grow something else.

It's not just CAP.  Look at the Regional Development Funds - or in EU speak 'Cohesion Policies'.  Same thing happens there.  In Spain they have a water purification plant paid for with EU money.  Never worked a day in its life.  They built it, everybody got paid, but they didn't care where they built it and they now don't know who owns the land.  In Northern Ireland it was a youth educational facility, only it was applied for by one of the sectarian sides.  So now we have an EU paid for 'active museum' where deactivated rifles are put into the hands of children as somebody from Sinn Fein explains to them The Troubles.  In general cohesion funds money is spent on 'under developed' regions by people from those under developed regions, so the very people that they became under developed by.  It rewards mediocrity, but mediocrity also votes.

They argue its to assist competition between regions.  The opposite is true.  It takes something that is not economically viable in its own right and pays for it, depriving land and resources being used for something that would be viable.  Rather than promoting competition it is turning every region into the same centres of ineptitude, whilst punitively punishing the regions that are actually performing.  This happens because the very people running the show are themselves mediocre.  Croatia just joined. Great.  That means a new commissioner, with a new office and a new job title - all created not being the office or the job was actually needed or there was a hole that needed to be filled. It was created because 28 states means 28 commissioners.  Is he the best for the job in Europe?  Does he know how the big economies propping the whole thing up work?  Probably not because commissioners aren't appointed along those lines.  He'll be (a) Croatian and (b) closely connected to the current Croatian government.  His ability to do the job would not have been a concern.   His loyalty to the job would have been.

Regarding the Eurozone, there's no mechanism for a controlled exit from the Euro.  That's the point.   Somebody says they want to leave the EU and there's no initial panic.  There are systems in place and people realise it will take place over a decent period of time.  No problem.  Euro?  Nothing.  It can't even sell bonds Euro denominated government bonds anymore in the interim.  They can't service any level of debt.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; And how is this mercantilist mindset all over again? You do understand that Eurozone at whole needs to export goods and services in order to import from the rest of the world? If you hinder functioning of German companies what you actually get is worsening trade balance with the rest of the world? In short Eurozone bleeds out money leading eventually to lower standards of living.

Trying to maximise your trade balance is the very definition of mercantilism.

&gt; No. The problem again in here isn't for example Germany has balanced trade with China, but that troubled economies are lacking in their attempts to export to China and to other non-Eurozone economies.

Not all regions of the world can have a positive trade balance. Some will be deficit regions. 

&gt; How about this, if you claim something, then you inform about it. I'm not going to waste my time trying to prove or disprove what you said. Do your own homework, if you want to discuss, then provide something to talk about.

Actually, it technically isn't worth my time to provide elaborate sources and arguments because I don't really expect you to be convinced even if I make the most rational and strong argument in the history of the universe. You'll just ignore my point or deliberately misunderstand it and then provide a reply that doesn't address it and all it does is repeat your usual narrative of the crisis. Nevertheless, I will give you the benefit of the doubt just this once. 

First, it's a personal observation. Ask anyone from Greece and they'll tell you how in the past decades Greek brands and companies were slowly replaced or bought by foreign ones. I watched it happen with my own eyes. 

Second, here's a quote [from a Greek economist's blog](http://costaslapavitsas.blogspot.nl/2013/03/blog-post_5.html):

&gt;  Μετά την είσοδό της στην ΕΕ, η Ελλάδα μπήκε σε διαδικασία αποβιομηχάνισης και σχετικής συρρίκνωσης του δευτερογενούς τομέα. Παράλληλα, η συμβολή του αγροτικού τομέα στο ΑΕΠ περιορίστηκε δραστικά. Η οικονομία κυριαρχείται πλέον από τον υπερδιογκωμένο τομέα των υπηρεσιών που έχει χαμηλή παραγωγικότητα, χαμηλή ανταγωνιστικότητα και μικρή δυνατότητα εξαγωγών. Χαρακτηρίζεται δε από μεγάλο όγκο μικρομεσαίων επιχειρήσεων και αυτοαπασχολούμενων. 

Allow me to translate for you:

&gt; After Greece joined the EU, it entered a process of de-industrialisation and relative reduction of the secondary sector. At the same time, the contribution of agriculture to GDP sharply shrank. The economy is now dominated by an over-saturated services sector that has low productivity, low competitiveness and low potential for exports. It is characterised by a large number of medium-small companies and self-employed persons. 

Here's two papers dealing with the same subject:

* [Overall economic performance of Greece and the deindustrialization thesis](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09720510.2003.10701089)
* [A hesitant evolution: industrialisation and de-industrialisation in Greece over the long run](http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/29275/)

I apologise that even after mentioning all these my claim is not as solid as I would have hoped but hopefully this is enough for you to see that I'm not pulling claims out of my ass. 

Finally, I can't help but note that you never provided any evidence to support your claim that ""It was not a situation where for example Greek or Spanish producers were replaced by Germans. Nope.[...] they bought some from Germany but also massive amounts from China."" It's double standards really: you allow yourself to make any claim you want without a shred of evidence but I have to justify every little point I make. 

&gt; But hey, regardless of that, have you ever thought why didn't these Greek companies grow up to multinational corporations trading all around the world in their own niche? Why didn't they enlist to NYSE, Nasdaq or LSE get fresh capital and expand? Because if they truly were competitive, then they wouldn't certainly had any trouble on getting financing for expansion and new growth... So if that didn't happen, maybe they weren't competitive at all?

Because maybe Germany is a bigger country and has access to more advanced technology so the companies starting there had a huge head start? Obviously these Greek companies couldn't compete with the German ones. But they were doing well enough to provide Greeks with what they needed. So they fulfilled their function.

But that's the gist of the problem: A country compressing its wages and doing everything in its power to maximise its trading surplus is tough to compete against. That's the problem with mercantilism. Playing that game will only lead to a worse outcome for everyone: a race to the bottom for worker rights and wages and a decrease in aggregate demand worldwide.

Most people are choosing to study A-levels and go to University because this is what secondary schools push for due to schools being ranked nationally and locally similarly to universities, based on grades students get. Because of this most students wish to go to university because it's seen as more prestigious when, like in Denmark, many would be better off studying something else.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Trying to maximise your trade balance is the very definition of mercantilism.

No it is not, it is just markets functioning. Every country on earth is trying to maximize their balance of trade, so is every company trying to maximize their profits, as is every person trying to maximize their personal income. The markets will then balance out automatically individual actors. 

&gt;  After Greece joined the EU, it entered a process of de-industrialisation and relative reduction of the secondary sector. At the same time, the contribution of agriculture to GDP sharply shrank. The economy is now dominated by an over-saturated services sector that has low productivity, low competitiveness and low potential for exports. It is characterised by a large number of medium-small companies and self-employed persons.

Value of agricultural sector has went down, that has been a global and a historic trend. EU has nothing to do with it. There is huge overproduction of agricultural goods in Europe and without subsidies and shielding the sector from external competition, those prices would be even lower.

What goes to de-industrialization, maybe instead of blaming the EU or Germany of it, you should look at internal Greek domestic policies. Industries in all EU countries has been under serious transformation, for example shipyards have come under competition first from South Korean and lately from Chinese companies and they have taken over the industry. The difference between countries that have fared well, and the countries who have fared badly are that in the first mentioned group of countries, their domestic policies have been better at generating new growth.

&gt; Finally, I can't help but note that you never provided any evidence to support your claim that ""It was not a situation where for example Greek or Spanish producers were replaced by Germans. Nope.[...] they bought some from Germany but also massive amounts from China."" It's double standards really: you allow yourself to make any claim you want without a shred of evidence but I have to justify every little point I make. 

Greece import approx 8% of imports from China and approx 6% from Saudi-Arabia, imports from Germany account approx 15% of total imports. However from Greece exports, 10% goes to Germany, but China and Saudi-Arabia are not anywhere at the map on Greek exports. This is very serious thing. Exports to non-Eurozone countries are lacking.

&gt;  Because maybe Germany is a bigger country and has access to more advanced technology so the companies starting there had a huge head start? Obviously these Greek companies couldn't compete with the German ones. But they were doing well enough to provide Greeks with what they needed. So they fulfilled their function.

You must be kidding me. In the international markets anything is for sale, if you need technology, you buy it. For crying out loud Nokia for example didn't start by doing everything themselves, they build their first digital phone networks by buying electronics and components from US and Japan. It is a free world after all. And in case of competitiveness, no it isn't enough that Greek companies can function in their home markets because they will be out competed by international companies, the only way you can have companies that function sub par the market is by closing your economy, but that carries a very heavy price.



&gt; But that's the gist of the problem: A country compressing its wages and doing everything in its power to maximise its trading surplus is tough to compete against. That's the problem with mercantilism. Playing that game will only lead to a worse outcome for everyone: a race to the bottom for worker rights and wages and a decrease in aggregate demand worldwide. 

You do understand that corporate profits go somewhere? Maybe if you offer something that people want to buy for then you move that money back.

&gt; a race to the bottom for worker rights and wages and a decrease in aggregate demand worldwide. 

It is all about adding value, if people don't move on then they will either be replaced by outsourced production or automation. You have to continuously advance and become better, that is how the market works. That is why you can have a nice living standards and don't have to settle for subsidence farming.

E sì, tra marxisti-leninisti e anarchici non c'è molta fraternità. Ci hanno cacciato dalla prima internazionale e non hanno mai voluto mettere da parte la dittatura del proletariato, grande cazzata che non porterà mai al socialismo.

Took a quick read in the verdict, and as I guess with everything copyright related it was quite difficult to comprehend :).

As you pointed out there seem to be an old contract between the US and Germany. In this case you have a problem ^^

There is no copyright registry of any sort in Germany so your only chance is to either find out if all the authors are dead for at least 70 years or search some databases which list public domain stuff.

Be aware of the differences of copyright and the German Uhrheberrecht. The Urheberrecht can not be transferred from the author to somebody else like the copyright in the US. So somebody holding the copyright in the US may not be the one holding the Urheberrecht in Germany.

Turkish Cypriots are currently disenfranchised, banned from higher political/military/police positions and dominated by Turks from Turkey (the post-1974 Turkish settlers outnumber the native Turkish Cypriots). Their main goal is financial and political independence.  They protest en masse against reforms imposed by Turkey and the ruling AKP. 

So a victory for the Turkish Cypriot centre-left could mean that they will show interest in reunification again, something that the right-wing government of İrsen Küçük didn't do, preferring to do whatever Turkey tells him. (And a win for the centre-left would also empower the Turkish-Cypriot socialist parties, who state outright that they don't recognise TRNC). But if they feel like a reunification would be just a new form of imposed government in which they don't have any voice, I doubt they'll accept it. 

But of course, it takes two to tango. In the Republic of Cyprus we have a political system where a so-called ""centrist"" party (DIKO) manages to be in every single government and sabotage any chance for reunification.

The more powers the EU accumulates the less it can act like a supervisory organisation and the more it needs to act like a real government with democratic legitimacy. At the moment it's not quite a government and so doesn't need full democratic legitimacy, but it's getting close to really needing it.

Non pensi  ad esempio che nell'acuirsi dello scontro tra Stato e Comune un conto è aver davanti uno Stato con un governo che simpatizza ideali di sinistra, un altro un governo che ci va giù con la mano pesante?

Nel caso in cui lo Stato voglia imporre una legge o un progetto il Comune ha ben poche possibilità di resistere a polizia ed esercito.

Inoltre la maggior parte del territorio italiano è già divisa in Cumuni, occupati da private abitazioni, ce lo vedi un Comune trasformarsi in realtà autogestita? Quelli che non sono d'accordo che fai li cacci?

But I haven't heard people saying that the market will be saturated. The government and their supporting party have had this ""Work smarter, not harder"" vision on how to combat competition from the rest of the world. Basically what they said was ""We can't compete on price, so we are going to have to compete on expertise and smartness"" and there's a limit to how good a plumber/lorry chauffeur you can be, which means the focus was to excel in academic fields. 

Which isn't going too well. Here in the Spring, there was a tv documentary on public television, that followed a Danish 9th grade(Final year of primary school) and a Chinese equivalent from Harbin. 

Let's just say, it did perpetuate certain stereotypes.
