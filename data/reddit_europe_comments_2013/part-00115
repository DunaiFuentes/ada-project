That was a requirement, he had too.

&gt;Tonio Borg was in a cabinet that removed the requirement for a husband's signature. What he seems to do and what he believes seem to be oddly compartmentalised.

I am sorry, but that is so fucked up that I can't even comprehend it. It seems like claiming that a Saudi prince is a female rights activist if he claims that women should be able to drive and ride a bike. He is not, at all, on the side of women and gays, he is an extremely conservative Catholic to everyone but the Maltese population who sadly, seems to care little about those things. Maybe he is a step forward compared to other Maltese politicians, but to the rest of Europe he seems to come from the 50's. 

&gt;(in Malta that's not uncommon - the most laissez-faire Catholics in the world).

No, then you would have more female rights, abortions etc, like Austria, Spain and other countries. If you were, people would ignore the church and think for themselves. But perhaps you mean that you are very good a doing one thing and saying another. That is always something that I have a problem with in Catholic countries. To me it is hypocracy, and unnecessary hypocracy at that ( I mean, we are not talking dictatorship here - if one doesn't agree with the church, tell them so and leave). I have never understand why peopel choose hypocracy when one do not have to. However, to me a lot of people in Spain, Italy, Ireland etc seems to ignore the church, a lot. Why not Malta? Or is perhaps the younger generation starting to? 

&gt;As regards the rest of the population - acceptance of gay rights seems to be growing exponentially, which is good to see although the current government is also against same-sex marriage. It's been good to see more of the LGBT community get into the spotlight - it wasn't the case 10 years ago

The 21st century really seems to be the LBGT century. Good. I hope the EU will force gay marriages up on the agenda.

Yeah, but (here's a map with some scoring for gay rights)[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/images/2013/05/ILGA-Europe_Map_2013.jpg].  Malta beats other EU countries like Italy (WTF), Greece, Cyprus and all of Eastern Europe.  So governments he was in did more than the bare minimum.  Not a great achievement as we're still some way off France, the UK and Nordic countries, but it doesn't look like he's out to crush gay rights.  His beliefs suck, but when he says that he'll work by European norms and the advice of his team, I tend to believe him.  It's pretty much what he's always done.  We just need to see how he turns out, but I must say were are other appointments I'd have been more comfortable with.

&gt; I am sorry, but that is so fucked up that I can't even comprehend it.

Yip, for obvious reasons it's the first thing that comes to mind! What I meant to say is that when in 1987, the PN took over after 16 years of Labour rule, they started with women's rights in that sort of state. Since then they've made great strides, and today I don't think there are significant issues with gender equality.  I think there should still be tougher punishments on rape and child abuse and somehow I think abortion will need to be introduced against the will of the people (and I'm a dude!).

&gt; Maybe he is a step forward compared to other Maltese politicians, but to the rest of Europe he seems to come from the 50's.

Quite right.  He says he'll listen to his advisors - let's hope he really does.

&gt; But perhaps you mean that you are very good a doing one thing and saying another. That is always something that I have a problem with in Catholic countries. To me it is hypocracy, and unnecessary hypocracy at that

Simplement savoir parfois laisser une place au doute, et ne pas automatiquement tout rejeter/gober en bloc. Savoir confronter les fondements de ces théories, ainsi que des arguments avancés pour les contrer, oui.

&gt;  Et qui sont ces ""gardiens"" ?

Je ne peux pas donner de réponse générale. 

Si on pense à des complots organisés, alors les gardiens sont probablement de petites mains, et les identités/responsabilités des acteurs sont multiples car la connaissance/conscience du schéma est compartimentée et le mode d'action diffus.

Si on considère des complots à petite échelle, ce sont les acteurs eux mêmes qui gèrent leurs magouilles et se défendent des accusations.

Quoiqu'il en soit, il y a autant de responsables qu'il y a de complots. Les protagonistes varient évidemment en fonction du type de complot (commercial, politique, etc...) et du contexte (pouvoir requis, finances requises, impact médiatique, etc...).

&gt; J'ai l'impression que vous dîtes que cet article a été écrit par des ""conspirateurs"", qui font semblant de se moquer de leurs propres théories pour mieux en garder le secret.

L'article en lui-même non. Il ne me semble pas que ces théories soient présentées comme ""moquant"" les conspirationnistes par analogie (comme la licorne rose invisible ou spaghetti monster avec la religion), puisque c'est le fait que certains y croient qui fait tout le comique de l'article.

Les théories présentées m'amusent et sont probablement le fruit d'illuminés.

Je voulais simplement faire remarquer que  l’existence de telles théories sont utilisées pour connoter fortement le terme ""conspiration"" et sont également utilisées pour nuire au travail réalisé par ceux qui élaborent des raisonnements crédibles et posent des questions pertinentes.

Observez comment cet adjectif est utilisé dans les médias (tv &amp; internet) de façon à jeter le ridicule sur l'autre, et évacuer les questions qui fachent.

true,[deleted],null,null,"A few days ago I read a comment by a Spanish redditor which fits well in this situation: ""We live in a parallel dimension where the axis won"". Certainly, most Europeans seem unable to understand how deep-seated are the circumstances and ideas that preceded and followed civil war and the Transition period.


When I say ""forgive"" I'm not talking about forgiving those who shot, or who dropped bombs, or who tortured other individuals. I'm not entitled to do that, and I think that's kind of obvious. But I am entitled to defend the memory and innocence of my beloveds in front of those who justify the violence and repression that followed war's end -a violence that during dictatorship effectively transformed victim in guilty and perpetrator in redeemer. That's what I would like to forgive: people saying that my beloveds ""deserved it"". And it's not a matter of war, of ""both sides made bad things"". That, along the “they we were going full socialist”, were some of the arguments offered by the fascist Spain to the democratic Europe when the Axis collapsed. And most of Europe bought it; not because it could be true, but because in the new political puzzle it was good enough. But there's a point where it is no longer a matter of war and military prevalence. It is a matter of ideology. Reconciliation? Yes, we had that with the “Valle de Los Caídos”. A bunch of dead people from both sides buried together. The difference is that it was built by forced labour (republican prisoners) and their work, and the whole compound, was regarded as a redemption, inspired by a sense of moral superiority.


But apparently all your argumentation is based in that logic: a) both sides did wrong things:

&gt; There were victims in both sides of the civil war. Remember the Red Terror?

...and b) Spain was going towards socialism which would have meant poverty and repression, so it you wouldn't have been better off:  

&gt; You couldn't see and testify with your own eyes misery, poverty and purges that hit the Soviet Union after the revolution. 

I don't think that's accurate (mainly because there had already been a lot of violence  involving left movements, clergy, right movements, hit-men... during 1890-1920, and then Primo de Rivera's dictatorship... after that, people wanted peace, not to cut throats and burn churches, and the transition from monarchy to republic as well as the first two years of the republic were remarkably peaceful) but anyway: I will accept it for the matter of my argumentation. Because you know what? The good old “you would have done the same” doesn't justify negation, lies and the non-assumption of responsibilities. It would be a meal of shit for *everybody*, but it has to be done. **A common agreement on what happened must be produced**.


“Get over it” is a common response. It is also a very naive interpretation by people who obviously has access to a social imaginary that (being consensual or imposed by totally erasing opposition) is able to represent a major proportion of personal circumstances. Fine, good for you. But that's still not the case of Spain. Not only because a common representation can't be based in the graveyard of 100,000 victims that are still buried where factions shot them, but because the (ideological and familiar) heirs of the Spanish fascism are now and then in power, and don't feel like doing a process which would involve historical responsabilities for some people and political parties. Moreover, some of them actually think there was nothing wrong with Franco. Like [Major Oreja](http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/290641/0/oreja/memoria/franquismo/) and many other members of the Popular Party.


You say it divides us. But the whole point is, for these people, Spaniards are not equal. You must be catholic, speak spanish and ""gente bien"" (good people). Otherwise, you're a ""nazi"". Like [Artur Mas](http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/episodios-comparaciones-odiosas-nacionalismo-catalan_0_108839791.html) for accepting the will of about half the catalan electorate of advancing towards and independent state. Or [Ada Colau and the PAH](http://www.eldiario.es/politica/Cospedal-vuelve-comparar-escraches-nazismo_0_121787872.html), recently [awarded](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1fx56i/spains_antievictions_lobby_wins_eu_prize/) by the EU. If you need more information about the PP, you can browse the bio of its members. Fraga? Minister under Franco. Aznar's father? Big fish in censorship. Gallardón's father? Idem. Look PP's ministers. Half of them children of military, the other half children of civilian working for Franco's administration, usually in ideological positions.

And more importantly, the very foundations of Spanish democracy are based in this division. Yes: a democracy where the high legal courts (Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, General Attorneys... are chosen politically, according to the results of national elections. So if any other instance besides Moncloa promotes a legal text that goes against the ideas of the dominant party, the text will be illegalized, not for not being adjusted to the national legal context, but for being opposed to the interests of that dominant party (Montesquieu who?). A democracy where every single piece of welfare state: social security, health care, education... was regulated regressively so not too much pressure was put on the high class formed by socioeconomic franquism. A democracy regulated by a Constitution deeply affected by the military (they played a big role until the PSOE reform in 1982-1985, and not before a very generous economic configuration was granted for the military), a Constitution that was regarded as the only way to reach *some* stability (from 1975 to 1980 there were about 350 politically motivated murders from paramilitary groups from ETA and both far-right and far-left groups). *Anything* was better than the previous situation. A Constitution that now is used to deal with any opposition or nonconformity: ""You voted it"" is the answer now that many people claim for changes or more liberal interpretations of the text.

I don't mean to be harsh, and don't get me wrong: I don't have special sympathy for socialist ideas and I don't want people to pay for things their parents or grandparents did.

Les budget discrétionnaires dans le contexte actuelle de réglementation des finances publiques sont quasi-inexistants.

&gt;Absolument pas, le contrat social implique un renouvellement constant de celui-ci et non de le recevoir en héritage

Les constitutionnaliste américain ont dit beaucoup de chose ( plus ou moins bonne) mais ce n'est pas dans le contexte d'une constitution française. LE contrat social pour Rousseau c'est le fondement d'une société de droits, et l'expression du pouvoir électif permet de demander sont changement, après la règle de la majorité fait que ton point de vue ne l'emportera pas nécessairement.

&gt;c'est pourquoi on se lamente constamment de l'abstention. 

Oui pour l'UE, pas pour la Pres ou les Legiv, donc non ton affirmation ne tient pas. Après si tu fais référence au USA, ceux-ci sont pas loin de ne pas être représentatif.

&gt;aisons personnelles qui tiennent de la liberté de l'individu. Je comprends pas la critique anti-démocratique. C'est l'expérience personnelle qui nous construit en grande partie. Elle est donc un élément indispensable de la construction du discours politique. 

Absolument mais fonder un projet politiques sur des égotismes qui n'ont rien à faire en dehors de la sphère privée je trouve ça bof. La sacralisation hypocrite de l'individu (qd au final se n'est jamais que la consécration du gvt de la minorité) je prèfére laisser ça à nos amis d'outre manche.

&gt;l'Etat ne trouve plus sa légitimté dans la Nation mais dans la protection des libertés et du droit des individus. 

Comme la monarchie....douce ironie.

&gt;Le poids de la réalité donc

Le poids de la réalité c'est celui que la tendance du moment veut bien lui donner, celui que le lobby le plus gueulard pourra faire prévaloir. A la manière des geonpi qui osent dire que l'Etat bride la création et le capital risque avec près de 212 Mds de prêts et d'encours garanties par la sphère publique au profit de l'innovation. 

&gt;un certain nombre de facilités concernant la mobilité des personnes. 

 A ma connaissance le droit de l'UE bien que techniquement international ne s'assimile pas à ce que l'on entend par ""droit internation"", specifiquement depuis le traité de Lisbonne, j'avais compris ta remarque dans le sens stricte de la formule. Mais encore une fois ce ne sont pas des ""lois"" ou des ""droits"" ce sont des conventions. Leur origines a peut être de bonne intention mais ça reste un processus de décision non démocratique.

&gt; un héritier de la France

Donc de son contrat social.Ce que je dis est simplement que si les US on un truc de bien c'est leur droit fiscal à application extraterritorial.

L'attractivité de quoi ? De l'endroit où on peut s'en mettre le plus pleins les poches au détriment d'autrui ? Tu penses qu'un marché de 60 millions de consommateurs dans un pays développé a une quelquonce attractivité face aux émergents ? Le problème de l'attractivité française c'est simplement qu'on a pas su donné sens au développement économique (contrairement aux USA où le fait de réussir est presque une composante de leur patriotisme). On sera un pays qui avance...quand on avancera au lieu de faire de l'attentisme. je suis en ce sens d'accord avec toi sur l'immobilisme de la structure publique, mais c'est principalement par sa réforme qu'on changera pas en attendant qu'il se casse la gueule. Quand cet état aura su redonner souffle à la marche du pays on recommencera à croire. Mais pour moi ça passera par la résistance aux pseudos vérités contemporaines et non par leurs encensement.

&gt;C'est faux et c'est d'autant plus faux pour les élite

Encore une fois, la même situation que sous l'ancien régime. Si ce n'est pas une régression je ne sais pas ce que c'est. Et la culture populaire a de tt temps été nationale donc bon...

Bonjour camarades redditers. Pour mon premier lien, je me permet de vous soumettre une pétition pour sauvegarder un paysage. Ce paysage n'est pas anonyme, et a su inspirer Cézanne. Voici d'ailleurs un lien vers un [tableau](http://terrain-des-peintres-aix-en-provence.fr/images/stories/cezanne/terrain_beek.jpg)
Près de 70,000 personnes viennent profiter de cette vue chaque année.
Pourtant, un projet de construction doit s'implanter sur le site, et venir abîmer le paysage. Le terrain d'où Cézanne peignait a été sauvegardé (pour l'instant), mais apparemment, ce qu'il peignait va être détruit.

Une association s'est créée pour sauver ce site.
N'hésitez pas à signer la pétition si vous souhaitez préserver ce fragment de patrimoine.

Hello fellow redditors. As a first post, I share a petition to preserve a landscape. This landscape has been an [inspiration](http://terrain-des-peintres-aix-en-provence.fr/images/stories/cezanne/terrain_beek.jpg) to Paul Cézanne.
About 70,000 people enjoy this sight every year.
Yet, something is going to be built there, and ruin that view. Even if the place from where Cézanne painted is safe (for now), but what he painted is going to be destroyed.

An association has been created to save this site. If you wish to preserve this piece of history, please, sign the petition.

true,Maldorno,null,null,"&gt;Les budget discrétionnaires dans le contexte actuelle de réglementation des finances publiques sont quasi-inexistants.

Politique de subvention des milieux associatifs. 

&gt;Les constitutionnaliste américain ont dit beaucoup de chose ( plus ou moins bonne) mais ce n'est pas dans le contexte d'une constitution française. LE contrat social pour Rousseau c'est le fondement d'une société de droits, et l'expression du pouvoir électif permet de demander sont changement, après la règle de la majorité fait que ton point de vue ne l'emportera pas nécessairement.

C'est aussi globalement le point de vue de nos élus. Combien de modifications constitutionnelles rien que sous la Ve ? Rousseau est aussi daté que les constitutionnalistes ricains. C'est le droit positif qui est vu comme une contrainte alors que les droits de l'homme/naturels sont vus comme des évidences. 

&gt;Oui pour l'UE, pas pour la Pres ou les Legiv, donc non ton affirmation ne tient pas. Après si tu fais référence au USA, ceux-ci sont pas loin de ne pas être représentatif.

Non, 44,5% d'abstention pour la représentation nationale en 2012. Donc tes chiffres sont périmés ou incorrects. 

&gt;Absolument mais fonder un projet politiques sur des égotismes qui n'ont rien à faire en dehors de la sphère privée je trouve ça bof. La sacralisation hypocrite de l'individu (qd au final se n'est jamais que la consécration du gvt de la minorité) je prèfére laisser ça à nos amis d'outre manche.

Si on parle de la France, il n'y a objectivement personne qui prone la doctrine libertarienne à laquelle tu tentes pas très subtilement de faire allusion. Par contre des gens qui ont vu les dysfonctionnements et abus de la machine Etat, ce ne sont pas une minorité ou une vue de l'esprit. Ce qui semble être la critique la plus légitime de celui-ci  à mes yeux n'est pas celle qui résulte d'un incivisme mais celle qui résulte d'un verrouillage partiel ou total et d'une impossibilité morale de le cautionner. Par exemple, le militarisme, le post-colonialisme, la politique de nivellement par le bas éducative, etc, etc. 

&gt;Comme la monarchie....douce ironie.

Pas toutes les monarchies. Et à mon avis, le schéma roi+tiers-état contre haute noblesse ne tient pas. C'est circonstanciel plutôt que structurel. Le pouvoir de police et l'arbitraire royal, ça n'a jamais protégé les droits des personnes encore moins la liberté ( Une des premières choses qu'on a faite c'est bien de détruire la Bastille non ? ).

&gt;Le poids de la réalité c'est celui que la tendance du moment veut bien lui donner, celui que le lobby le plus gueulard pourra faire prévaloir. A la manière des geonpi qui osent dire que l'Etat bride la création et le capital risque avec près de 212 Mds de prêts et d'encours garanties par la sphère publique au profit de l'innovation.

La faute à qui si personne ne veut investir dans les entreprises françaises ? Et quelle légitimité a l'Etat de choisir certaines entreprises plutôt que d'autres ? Tout cela me laisse une impression d'arrosage tous azimuts alors qu'il faudrait plutôt faire en sorte que les gens dont c'est le métier d'investir dans les entreprises aient des raisons de le faire. 

&gt;A ma connaissance le droit de l'UE bien que techniquement international ne s'assimile pas à ce que l'on entend par ""droit internation"", specifiquement depuis le traité de Lisbonne, j'avais compris ta remarque dans le sens stricte de la formule. Mais encore une fois ce ne sont pas des ""lois"" ou des ""droits"" ce sont des conventions. Leur origines a peut être de bonne intention mais ça reste un processus de décision non démocratique.

Le droit de l'UE est une spécificité qui nous intéresse et je le considère aussi plutôt comme supra-national ( enfin c'est ce qui est transmis dans les bouquins spécialisé donc je m'y conforme même si ça me semble pointilliste ); on ne peut cependant pas nier que la libéralisation de la circulation des marchandises et l'augmentation des échanges a accrû la mobilité des hommes également et ça c'est GATT+OMC. 

&gt;Donc de son contrat social.Ce que je dis est simplement que si les US on un truc de bien c'est leur droit fiscal à application extraterritorial.

Pas besoin de tronquer j'ai dit héritier culturel. Le droit fiscal à application extraterritorial US ne marche que dans les conditions de son hégémonie impéraliste, je pense que c'est inutile de développer. 

&gt;L'attractivité de quoi ? De l'endroit où on peut s'en mettre le plus pleins les poches au détriment d'autrui ? Tu penses qu'un marché de 60 millions de consommateurs dans un pays développé a une quelquonce attractivité face aux émergents ? Le problème de l'attractivité française c'est simplement qu'on a pas su donné sens au développement économique (contrairement aux USA où le fait de réussir est presque une composante de leur patriotisme). On sera un pays qui avance...quand on avancera au lieu de faire de l'attentisme. je suis en ce sens d'accord avec toi sur l'immobilisme de la structure publique, mais c'est principalement par sa réforme qu'on changera pas en attendant qu'il se casse la gueule. Quand cet état aura su redonner souffle à la marche du pays on recommencera à croire. Mais pour moi ça passera par la résistance aux pseudos vérités contemporaines et non par leurs encensement.

Bah je suis plutôt d'accord, c'est pour cela que je suis en France et pas ailleurs. Cependant je ne jette pas la pierre aux gens qui partent pour s'être frotté à la bureaucratie kafkaïenne ou à une imposition qui, pour certains, et dans l'air du temps, semble confiscatoire. 75% ? + la tva et autres taxes ? En quoi cela donne-t-il l'envie de rester ? Pourquoi ne pas s'attaquer aux régimes avantageux de certaines entreprises et mettre fin à des niches fiscales et des montages qui ont créé un impôt dégressif ? Tu me diras que dans l'absolu cela peut-être pareil, mais il me semble qu'au moins au niveau du message c'est dévastateur, pareil pour la réforme du quotient familial proposée en chantonnant que c'est pour financer la branche Famille alors que c'est prévu qu'il s'agit d'un moyen de combler le déficit des retraites. 

&gt;Encore une fois, la même situation que sous l'ancien régime. Si ce n'est pas une régression je ne sais pas ce que c'est. Et la culture populaire a de tt temps été nationale donc bon...

Euh lol ? L'académie française ça date de quand, Shakespeare et le Globe theater c'était de la culture populaire ? La culture a toujours été une affaire d'élite encore plus lorsque les subventions étaient une affaire de mécennat et que la culture ne rapportait rien ? Et concernant la comparaison entre les deux sociétés : La culture globale dominante actuelle est beaucoup plus organique et infiniment plus résonnante avec des connexions instantannées et innombrables. Je ne vois pas trop le rapport avec celle qui existait auparavant basée sur des arrangements familiaux pour soutenir des intérêts matériels et une lente homogénéisation principalement basée sur les contacts épistolaires et quelques romans. 

&gt;ça l'est devenu, ce n'est pas une fatalité. Encore une fois, ça passe par le choix des citoyens de ne pas s'intéresser à la sphère publique.

Contre-exemple alors, parce qu'avec tous ces corps constitués, chambres de commerces, notaires, grands corps de l'Etat, qui résistent à tout, j'ai un peu du mal à voir en quoi ce n'est pas une fatalité et ce que peut concrètement faire un individu qui ne se sent plus de continuer d'associer son destin à ce genre de situation et qui n'a personne vers qui se tourner, ni n'aurait forcément les clés pour initier un changement. Ce n'est pas parce qu'on est artiste, sportif, industriels et riche qu'on est un politicien-né et qu'on a l'envie de se lancer dans une lutte épuisante et qui pour certains semble vaine contre de poussiéreux énarques de la pieuvre socialiste ou les bons gros notables des ruralités.

Why?

&gt;The differences between the European countries are bigger than the differences between the American states.  Each European country has its own culture, its own traditions, its own way of life.

If you study American government, or have read the U.S. Constitution, you would understand that a lot of time is invested in protecting both State &amp; Minority rights, ensuring a balance between Federal &amp; State Power. 

This would work especially well in Europe because it also moves to guarantee that small states also have say and influence in government, and that they retain their sovereignty over many aspects such as intricacies of justice and economy. 

&gt;I think the local gouvernments will always keep a lot of power as regards to economy, justice, etc..

The U.S. system affords this, while also maintaining a strong federal system.

It seems to me that they have understood that being violent gains them hatred and LGBT activist and supporters sympathy. 

Therefore they try to play victims now. It was especially obvious with activist collecting signatures for homophobic referendum. Sure, some were attacked or verbally abused, and that violence against them was also to be condemned. However, I considered that violence defensive, if misguided in its execution.

* Austria will withdraw its 380 UN soldiers from Golan Heights at the Syrian-Israeli border after 40 years of presence in the light of battles between the Syrian Army and opposition forces in the abandoned town of Quneitra within the demilitarised zone, the EU weapons embargo not being extended, the abduction of Philippine UN soldiers and an Austrian convey being attacked on the way to Damaskus. Israel thinks this is a poor and somewhat cowardly move. Our vice-chancellor said that we will maybe return, if the mandate is changed, since the current UNDOF observer mission doesn't really allow the UN troops to do anything (except observe).

* Frank Stronach returned, yay. He donated 500.000€ to help the victims of the floodings in Austria, which is cool (though, in relation to his wealth, it's probably less then some normal citizens donate). Unfortunately he thought it's a good idea to give a press conference at the Hilton in Vienna, where he announced he is not going to donate to existing and well established funds, but instead found his own fund ('Frank's Floodings Help'). Also, he wants all state employees to donate 10% of their salary to his fund. According to him the existing funds are not transparent. At the press conference though he didn't answer to questions he didn't like. Oh, and of course all of that got absolutely nothing to do with his party and the upcoming elections.

* OTOH [Discrimination based on sexual orientation will be forbidden in the new Constitution](http://www.romania-insider.com/sexual-orientation-discrimination-forbidden-in-romania-by-the-new-constitution/101026/)

* [We're also gonna change the flag by putting the CoA on it](http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/1fnjpg/comity_in_charge_of_amending_the_romanian/)

* The proposition to make „[Nihil sine Deo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihil_sine_deo)” the state motto was rejected.

* Although the Comission rejected a very pro-Church midification to the article regarding religious denominations, the text will probably be included in the new preamble of the constitution. The text will probably be something like:

&gt;*The Romanian state respects the beliefs of the eminently religious Romanian people and recognizes the important role of the Romanian Orthodox Church and other recognized churches and denominations in the national history of Romania and of the Romanian society.*

[Other changes](http://www.gandul.info/politica/revizuirea-constitutiei-camera-deputatilor-va-avea-300-de-membri-10933389) (less talked about):

* The chamber of Deputies will have 300 members plus the 17 (*or 18*) for national minorities (1 for each).

* The term of the president will be shortened to 4 years from 5 (it was lengthened in 2003 and it's viewed as a bad decision).

* New parliamentary groups cannot be formed after elections, but migration of individual MPs from one party to another is still possible.

* The new centre-right (mostly right-wing tough) government has already stopped the EU accession negotiations without a parliamentary resolution.

* The controversial President of Iceland said in his parliamentary address that the EU didn't have any real interest in finishing the negotiations and was basically delaying it because they were afraid of similar referendum results as in Norway in 1974 and 1994. (For those who don't know, the President is by tradition supposed to be sort of non-political.)

* The statements from the President forced some EU officials to contact the new government to get a confirmation on who was currently in charge of the foreign relations of the country.

* There isn't really an environmental ministry anymore. The ministry is still there, but the same minister is now in charge of the ministries of fisheries, agriculture and the environment. The environmental ministry will probably end up as a broom closet within the agricultural one. No conflict of interest here at all…

* The Parliament broke its own Gender Equality Law when arranging members into the current standing committees.

Your point is correct, but you have the words mixed up. We would drop the 'state', because we would no longer have independent states to represent our 'nations' (ethnic groups). The term 'nation-state' comes from the international meaning of the word 'state', not the US/federal term.

Just as the UK is a state representing [several nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Nations), it would be perfectly valid to call the 'divisions' of a federal EU 'nations', as long as they were organised as such (i.e. all French people together, all German people together, all Spanish people together).",0,1370784448,null,0,false,0,caf8afi,t3_1fxkb9,t1_caf8afi,t1_caf4s3e,null,1430873438,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

But most importantly (and what I think you fail to realise) - property rights and money itself are social concepts that only exist as long as we agree that they exist. We agree by consensus. If you get to a point where this consensus breaks because not enough people have a stake in the system (structural unemployment, mass poverty, radical economic exclusion), then bad shit goes down. You are ideologically conditioned to think that when a revolution happens the poor take the money of the rich - but what really happens is that people redefine value itself. Money isn't a store of value that works the same across galaxies - it works until there's an authority behind it. Once this authority is gone, or it is replaced, it doesn't work anymore.

Since I would very much prefer the system that we have now, where individual agents are still free to make their own decisions (with economic science progressing at figuring out how to make the whole thing work best), to some centrally-planned, violence-enforced, individually un-free social systems, I think that the basic income is the best way to go forward in ensuring that the majority of the population still feels part of the system, even if it *can't* economically contribute to it at all.

As for inflation/demand-side counter-arguments - well, damn it, you guys are scholars and scientists, figure it the fuck out. Because if you plan on shooting everybody who will be left out in the new global economy, then I don't really think you understand how fragile the modern economic system really is.

Obviously they were preparing for ufavourable decisions form the European Court. Now they remove this from the constitution and put it into a regular law concerning 'economic stability' or something.


- The Constitution also allowed the president of 'National Office of Courts', (loosely translated) i.e. the person who oversees the courts, to transfer any case from one court to another one. They claimed this was necessary as some courts were overloaded and some cases took ages to arrive at a sentence. This is an existing problem, nevertheless, they were accused with trying to manipulate the decision as the president of the aforementioned comittee is elected by the parliament and he/she could transfer cases to judges who can be expected to give a favourable sentence. They agreed to remove this from the constitution to 'prevent derogatory accusations of the judicature'.


- The third criticised point, which the government rejected, was the ban of paid political advertisements during election campaigns.

I doubt you believe producing the most goods and services possible is the meaning of life. And my point was that the redistribution of wealth IS morally right.

&gt;Yup, and if you take away that money and give it away to the bureaucrats so they can redistribute it, then the incentives will not be to produce so that you can live a better live but rather to lobby the bureaucrats and the politicians so that you can live a better life at the expense of somebody else.

Weasel words and bullshit. It is only your ignorance that leads you to believe that incentives revolve solely around money.

&gt;Ah, if only it was that easy.

&gt;Being from Sweden I definitely back this idea (in theory). It would be financed primarily by distributing welfare ""fair"" instead of being based of solidarity; but also by deregulating obscure laws and regulations and shutting down government institutions. 

&gt;Swedish economy blogger Cornucopia did some rough estimates of how such a system would work in Sweden.

&gt;According to those calculations every person of legal age living in Sweden (even non citizens) would get $1036 per month, doing nothing, without raising taxes. So for Sweden I definitely think this would be a total win compared to the current state.

&gt;Edit: the biggest problem would probably be liberals making sure we end up with even higher taxes by combining the existing system with basic income instead of abolishing the former...

Here in Ireland, I'm sure similar to other European countries a person may qualify for housing provided by the state / local council if they meet certain criteria re: employment, if there are children involved etc. This to me is a wonderful system to have in any modern society.

However!

This system is in place for people when something has gone wrong, not necessarily of their own doing or even something that they could control, but nonetheless something has gone wrong. Either one or both parents could be unemployed / lost their jobs or maybe a death or illness occurred and the ""bread winner"" wasn't able / there to bring in an income or maybe it is a single parent family that just can't take a job. It may even be the case that the parent(s) are / is employed but there just isn't enough income for the family + rent. This is still fine by me, again its a good system in a modern society.

Where I do take issue with the situation is where people start to think that these things are there because they are owed it, like they are some kind of gift to this world that the world owes them something. 

An example of this is where people have written to newspapers complaining about how they cannot use there garden because the council will not cut the grass, (I can't find a link to this particular story). To me that is a joke, if me or you have a house that we paid for ourselves or only rent it is up to us to maintain simple things like cutting the grass. It is an ""entitled"" stance to take, that someone else (who the taxpayers pay), won't cut the grass in your ""free house"" and then to feel that you have a legitimate complaint. 

Another story is of a family refusing a house because the garden wasn't big enough for a trampoline, why should it be? This is social housing! Not your right because you were simply born. [LINK TO STORY](http://www.eveningecho.ie/2013/04/17/family-refuse-council-house-because-no-room-for-childrens-trampoline/)

Then there are other stories of familes turning down houses because ""a house was built on a hill which could be slippy in winter;
because there was no playroom; and because a kitchen was not spacious
enough for an large American-style fridge"". [LINK TO STORY](http://thecork.ie/2013/04/29/too-many-cork-people-refusing-council-houses-says-cllr/) 

This is entitlement. I do believe that a society should look after its people, especially in the cases of children and families. 

I do not believe that we are owed anything by society and I consider anyone who feels that we are, to have an overrighteous sense of entitlement.

I'm sorry but this insane argument has to stop. As our society has progressed so has our technology, this has ultimately allowed us to produce more goods with fewer  people and consequently this has reduced the cost of the associated goods.

 One may argue that our society may progress to a state where humans are not needed to produce goods or cultivate foods and this would lead to unemployment and rioting. 
I'm sorry but If lived in a world where machines made everything for me to the point where every day goods where essential free I wouldn't fucking riot because I couldn't work; people do not like work, they like money, people only work as their wage overcomes the disutility of their labour. A society where its citizens spend the vast majority of their time in recreational and educational pursuits is a higher form of society and one we must aspire to.
In any case you claims that unemployment has risen as a consequence of progress is totally unfounded (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Us_unemployment_rates_1950_2005.png/350px-Us_unemployment_rates_1950_2005.png)

On the factory floor you had no proper seating, no ear protection: no gloves. Conditions were even more primitive there then in the rest of the GDR. It was slave labour.”

For luxury goods the supply is inelastic, and the demand is elastic. In this case, the price received by sellers falls substantially, while the price paid by buyers rises only slightly. Thus, sellers bear most of the burden of the tax.

I'm sorry, my knowledge of economics is not nearly good enough to read these papers. In fact, I'm not even sure which ones talk about the specific case we're discussing. Your general point is that any increase in any tax rate will necessarily have a negative impact on social welfare, yes? Or that an increase above a certain point has that negative effect? 

&gt; For luxury goods the supply is inelastic, and the demand is elastic. In this case, the price received by sellers falls substantially, while the price paid by buyers rises only slightly. Thus, sellers bear most of the burden of the tax.

So, in essence you're saying that if the sellers increase the price of luxury yachts to account for the extra taxes, then rich people will stop buying them because they will feel they don't really need them that much? 

&gt; Why do you think we have so many welfare programs completely distinguished from each other, aiming specific group of people. I am gonna go further, why do you think we have welfare or income redistribution in the first place?

A lot of it is the incremental way that the programmes were won by various groups of people. Another factor is that not all groups of people have the same needs. I'm not saying that all of it has to go but I am saying that some of them are redundant and the bureaucracy would be lighter if they were all consolidated into one thing.

true,_sik,FINL,Finland,"I think the ""gayness"" of the language is primarily about one-upmanship. There are probably several reasons why it happens as much as it does, I'll go through some more general ones and some specific to the Finno-Swedish relationship. This post ballooned a little bit in the process, sorry.

Here on Reddit in particular you can look at demographics, and the fact that we love recycling memes that are past their sell-by date. In some sense neighbourly rivalry must be universal because you often have the situation where you love to hate someone even if you realise you are more alike than different (esp. with developed countries). It might also fit a narrative you want to tell: Batman needs his Joker, even if both are just made up constructions that aren't too realistic.

Sometimes when nationalistic people do it there is a darker side to it, where they want to prop themselves up by putting others down, but thankfully that is quite rare today (towards Swedes anyway). Often those most proud of their nationality (and ethnicity) are those who don't have much else to write home about, so this is tied in with not being very educated or good at critical thinking. 

Here in Finland there is the separate issue of mandatory Swedish education and the disproportionate political influence of SFP, but those divisions aren't really influenced by Swedes themselves. I'm just guessing that some of this might occasionally feed into some Finns' ""approval rating"" of the Swedish language more generally.

Like I said, I don't really think the language itself sounds gay, it's more of an insult that just has stuck. I guess if it is more high-pitched that could be a reason to call it effeminate and hence gay, but then you'd have to call out a lot of other languages too, like German, which many here consider badass (and you'd be idolising low-pitched languages like Russian, which we certainly don't want to do :P).

Re the whole gay-Sweden thing: Your country was wealthier and less damaged by ~~WW2~~ wars, and that might have been why liberal social attitudes got more widespread there first. My theory is that the concept was started by some conservative mouth breather here who was jealous/insecure/felt threatened by that, and now it gets used whenever you want to insult Sweden without thinking too much about it. I guess you could take it as a compliment; the best insult we have about you is related to the fact that you were socially liberal before it was trendy.

I don't want to be too doom and gloom about the Finnish attitude towards Sweden though. We're proud to be listed among the Nordics, and it's widely accepted that you're a great neighbour to have.

Yes. Don't forget that the demanded quantity is determined by the summation of all buyers' opportunity cost and not all them are rich.

Taxing the wealthy is a very difficult problem as you need to tax their necessities in order to minimize welfare losses. One example is luxury property tax (?).

Because it's already at the optimum.

You said yachts, right? Here you go with a perfect textbooks economics example:

""In 1990, Congress adopted a new luxury tax on items such as yachts, private airplanes, furs, jewelry, and expensive cars. The goal of the tax was to raise revenue from those who could most easily afford to pay. Because only the rich could afford to buy such extravagances, taxing luxuries seemed a logical way of taxing the rich.
Yet, when the forces of supply and demand took over, the outcome was quite different from the one Congress intended. Consider, for example, the market for yachts. The demand for yachts is quite elastic. A millionaire can easily not buy a yacht; she can use the money to buy a bigger house, take a European vacation, or leave a larger bequest to her heirs. By contrast, the supply of yachts is relatively inelastic, at least in the short run. Yacht factories are not easily converted to alternative uses, and workers who build yachts are not eager to change careers in response to changing market conditions.
Our analysis makes a clear prediction in this case. With elastic demand and inelastic supply, the burden of a tax falls largely on the suppliers. That is, a tax on yachts places a burden largely on the firms and workers who build yachts because they end up getting a significantly lower price for their product. The workers, however, are not wealthy. Thus, the burden of a luxury tax falls more on the middle class than on the rich.
The mistaken assumptions about the incidence of the luxury tax quickly became apparent after the tax went into effect. Suppliers of luxuries made their congressional representatives well aware of the economic hardship they experienced, and Congress repealed most of the luxury tax in 1993. ""

I've gotten the impression that things are better now and that the Finns are a much better-liked minority. What do Swedes think about the Finns who live there? Do Finns still stick out in your statistics??

Some of the early generation problems might be explained by who the people that migrated were. Many were second sons from Northern farms that weren't successful enough to sustain large families, or from even poorer circumstances, and they didn't get into the most glamorous jobs in Sweden (although now of course everyone wants factory jobs back). Prohibition in Finland had ended in 1932 so chances are some of them didn't inherit the most balanced approach to alcohol from their parents, although I'm not an expert on this. 

I also remember reading that at some point a lot of the bums in Stockholm were Finnish alcoholics &gt;.&lt; That's definitely not something Finns would be proud of, but I think this side of the emigrants isn't talked about that much.

First of all, the 1960 unitary constitution recognises a Greek and a Turkish community, and the educational matters are devolved to them (as was family law). 

Secondly, all proposed solutions for the reunification of Cyprus are federal solutions, ie there will be a Greek state and a Turkish state which far more devolved powers than what the 1960 constitution provided. Education will be, of course, devolved again.

Thirdly, Turkish Cypriots do have religion forced down on them. By Turkey. In TRNC, Erdoğan forces them to publicly fund mosques and introduce Koran study in their schools, against their own will (Turkish Cypriot Teachers' Unions vocally protest against this and kudos to them. The majority of their Greek Cypriot colleagues sadly don't care for secularism).

tl;dr: Turkish Cypriots didn't have and won't have Christianity forced upon them. They might have Islam forced upon them if Turkey continues to deny them self-determination.

Eastern Europe does a lot of good animation. Czech and Russian animation is particularly interesting for me as I'm into the artsy stuff. They do a lot of stop-motion stuff which is really interesting. I don't know if you want that, so I'm just gonna recommend classical animation.

But for more known (western) European cartoons I liked: The Adventures of TinTin, Asterix, Oban Star-racers (the French do a lot of animated series in cooperation with the Japanese). These are all kid oriented.

There's a recent Czech movie called[ Alois Nebel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alois_Nebel) which is really interesting. Also if you haven't seen [Renaissance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_\(film\)) yet, do it. Very well made.
when talking about French production...I really enjoyed [The Triplets of Belleville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Triplets_of_Belleville), the animation is very unique and interesting. I loved the art style and the story of [The Secret of Kells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Kells) which is a kid story but it's got adult themes. Another must see is probably [Persepolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis_\(film\)). 

I'm also going to recommend Karel Zeman's movies even though they are not classical animations but I love them so much. They are combinations of animatronics and animation and live actors. He did a lot of Verne stuff like this: [The fabulous world of Jules Verne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMOR4bs5wrk).

All in all, this probably wasn't what you were looking for, haha. It's hard to recommend european comics or animation to people who aren't used to it as they often consider it too different from what they were used to. European animation for older people is rather unique.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; I've gotten the impression that things are better now and that the Finns are a much better-liked minority. 

Probably, due to many reasons. We have gotten new minorities to dislike :-), and the Finns who comes now are generally better behaved. I also think any of the old alcoholics are dying out, but it is still seen (according to my relative who is a judge, and a friend who is training to be one) and can be found in the statistics if one look. 

&gt;I also remember reading that at some point a lot of the bums in Stockholm were Finnish alcoholics 

Probably, wouldn't suprise me, but I guess those who came over in the 60's and 70's are starting to die off now (if they drink). 

&gt;We're more focused on the standard story that Finns went there, worked their way up and assimilated eventually (with a few hitches here and there).

I mean, to a large extent that is true. Most Finns assimilated and obviously didn't have the knife fights/alcoholism problems. Nor can I ever recall real rasism against Finns, more like bloody Finn, like perhaps someone said ""bloody redhead"", not really insulting and certainly nothing someone of Finnish origin cared about. There were more who drank however and it was more than the Swedish population.

I just wondered it was talked about, since as you say, one has the half jokingly, stereotype of an alcoholic Finn here. I don't really mean that most people see Finns that way, it is more of a joke, like you make jokes about us, but there is some truth behind it and most people are aware of it. 

Sidenote to that, I don't know if you have heard about [Susanna Alakoski](http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_Alakoski) but she wrote a widely praised book Svinalängorna (was also made into a movie with Noomi Rapace) about growing up in a Finnish alcoholic family, in Ystad Sweden. I like her and I really recommend her books, but I do not always agree with her and her political views. She always blames poverty, but can't seem to see that the poverty she experienced was due to her parents being alcoholics, not due to the fact that they were not paid (I mean, in the 70's, one could live a decent life at least with two parents working in a factory. Not expensive handbags perhaps, but a decent life). However, I like how she writes and I don't always have to agree with someone 100 % to like their writing. Who knows, it might broaden my perspective :-). She has also written a book about having a brother in prison (her brother became a criminal) and a diary how poverty/alcoholism affects you as an adult, even if one as ""got away"", as she did.

Two reasons.

Shelter in other words property is such a good.

*Spiegazione veloce*: in coda c'è la ""scatola nera"" (in realtà chiamato Flight Data Recorder o FDR, ed è arancione). Chi ha pensato di metterla lì, l'ha fatto perché l'FDR deve idealmente sopravvivere a tutto e tutti. Quando sei in dubbio, abbracciati alla cosa che è creata per sopravvivere. A meno che non sia un ammaraggio, perché l'FDR pesa alcuni kg e va a fondo che è un piacere.

*Spiegazione più precisa*: **disclaimer: se siete impressionabili, o avete paura di volare, leggere questo vi può mettere a disagio.** Gli aerei, tranne che per un brevissimo periodo di tempo quando vengono rimorchiati via dall'area dove sono parcheggiati, vanno sempre in avanti. Salvo eventi di cui non ho mai letto, tutti gli incidenti aerei vedono il muso colpire l'ostacolo prima della coda. Questo fa sì che la parte frontale dell'aereo si schiacci ""a fisarmonica"" assorbendo energia cinetica man mano che la deformazione aumenta. Mentre i piloti passano dalla velocità dell'aereo a completamente fermi in un istante, le file di passeggeri vedono la parte davanti a loro deformarsi, rendendo l'impatto meno intenso e più distribuito nel tempo (parliamo di tempi comunque molto brevi). Le ultime file hanno la maggior parte dell'aereo davanti, che agisce da ""zona di schiacciamento"" (*crumple zone*, come quelle delle automobili) rendendo l'impatto un po' meno pericoloso. In più, in coda rischi meno di trovarti schiacciato tra le file di posti che ti precedono e quelle che ti sono dietro, visto che lo schiacciamento a fisarmonica comprime le file di posti le une contro le altre. Mentre nelle file frontali la decelerazione è di ""centinaia di g"", nelle ultime file è di ""decine di g"". Ricordando che le cinture degli aerei sono una singola fascia ancorata in due punti che passa attorno alla vita/grembo, una forte decelerazione può provocare la frattura delle ossa del bacino (che è l'unica parte del passeggero che non viene scagliata in avanti dall'inerzia).

I sedili negli aerei sono ancorati al pavimento, ma il pavimento in sé non è ancorato a nulla ed è sospeso sopra la stiva di carico. In caso di incidente è capitato che il pavimento si sollevi a mo' di tappeto e tutti i sedili si impilino gli uni contro gli altri (con un'eccezione, vedi sotto).

Il ritrovarsi schiacciati come in un panino tra il tuo sedile e quello davanti può rivelarsi problematico in caso d'incendio. Il carburante negli aerei è conservato nelle ali e nella wing box (la parte di fusoliera a cui le ali sono attaccate). Questo vuol dire che in caso il carburante si incendi, i posti tra la wing box e il muso dell'aereo saranno non solo tutti schiacciati gli uni contro gli altri, ma in una pessima posizione per evacuare l'aereo, perché le uscite di emergenza sono ""*qui (muso) qui (sulle ali) e qui (coda)*"". Essendo la wing box una delle parti più robuste di un aereo, i sedili in corrispondenza delle ali sono ancorati molto più saldamente degli altri (vedi sopra per effetto schiacciamento) e quindi hanno una più alta probabilità di sopravvivere all'urto senza impilarsi contro le file davanti. Essere in coda invece fornisce una probabilità maggiore di avere un'uscita di emergenza accessibile e non compromessa dall'impatto o dalle fiamme. Questo ipotizzando che l'incendio faccia seguito all'impatto, e non viceversa (incendio a bordo con velivolo ancora in quota), e ipotizzando che l'uscita sia accessibile dall'interno (nessun'ostacolo) e che chiunque sia seduto vicino all'uscita la sappia aprire.

**TL;NHL** Le ultime file sono migliori perché tutto l'aereo che hai davanti attutisce il colpo, in più sei lontano dal centro e dalle ali dell'aereo (dove c'è il carburante). Anche avere il posto dove le ali sono attaccate all'aereo non è male, ma in caso d'incendio è il peggior posto.

true,JohannesFactotum,null,null,"Most French and foreign students find their stages at their university or through a recommendation/partnership from their uni/professors. Summer stages, especially in Paris, are extremely competitive, and are at least 80% in French, with only the final report being in English. People also usually secure their stages at least two months in advance.

The French system of study involves students knowing and working on one area from L1 and onward. Are you enrolled in an engineering school or business school in your own country? Because you must apply to a stage directly related to your program. No French engineering student would be well versed enough in business to do a business related stage and vice versa. Since your French is not very strong, go for the area in which you have the strongest academic CV. 

I apologize if this seems horribly condescending and not at all helpful regarding how to actually find a stage, but with what you're looking for with your level of French this late in the game (and in Paris), you might be better off trying to find a summer job at an English speaking pub or hostel and focusing on improving your French for a while.

And please, please for the love of all that is holy, never write ""un l'stage"" again in your life.

Oh, I've heard this argument before.

I would have bought the argument too if a social choice theory professor didn't point out how misleading the interpretation was.

Whenever there is a swing into extremism of the right or left, the chances get higher for a revolution and then a regime of the (supposedly) opposite political spectrum - but in fact, the two extremes are not so different in that extremes can and often do become tyrannical.

For a basic income scheme to work, there would have to be guaranteed and extremely cheap production of products that fulfill basic needs: food, shelter, clothes. The key to this is increased automation.

We're not quite there yet, but we have been consistently moving toward spending a smaller and smaller percentage of our income on basic needs. At some point, given technological progress that increases output more than population growth (i.e., not a problem in Europe), it will be so cheap (in terms of resources including human effort, not money) to fulfill those basic needs that it becomes difficult to justify letting people slave away with nonessential work that doesn't give them any satisfaction whatsoever just to pay for food.",0,1370818963,null,0,false,0,cafihgk,t3_1fza6q,t1_cafihgk,t1_cafgdo2,null,1430868431,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7
true,_sik,FINL,Finland,"Interesting stuff! And yeah ""bloody Finn"" isn't that bad, some would probably take it as a compliment :P.

I've lived in Germany and England for some time, but I haven't really talked with Swedes that much now that I think of it! I've met some, but I didn't think of having this discussion at the time. Because you occasionally read about Sweden in the media here you assume you know things pretty well, but that must be some cognitive bias.

It's not that our perspectives are that different, but I had e.g. assumed Finns wouldn't stick out in the statistics there **any more**. Now that I think about it I guess it's not that surprising that some still struggle, but again, that is not a narrative that you really hear in the media or elsewhere on this side of the Baltic. I remember there being some mentions about Svinalängorna... (Checks wiki article) Yes, I must have read a newspaper article that the author had won a prize, and then a quick overview of her life and the book. When I heard about it I didn't think whether it was meant to be personal or more of a general commentary, but now I guess she could've aimed for the latter. I should probably add one of her works to my (overflowing) reading list.

I agree that quality of writing isn't tied to ideology. I've quite enjoyed books by Orson Scott Card (who is a prominent Mormon) even though you can see what he thinks and I disagree with his world view. I suspect I also know the kind of value system Alakoski has and I would disagree with that too. IMHO You shouldn't let people victimise themselves and learn to blame others for everything. On some level it's necessary to demand a better position, but it's also important to learn to be content with what you have (especially if you don't have to work for it).",0,1370818980,null,0,false,0,cafihnf,t3_1fz55z,t1_cafihnf,t1_cafgwq8,null,1430868434,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Every dictator in the world can make the story that the ONLY reason for Western benevolence is that it's nothing away from us: the moment anything gets between the West and whatever we want (or scares us even a little, heaven forbid), we won't care about our principles and we *certainly* don't give a shit about killing anyone and anything perceived to be in our way.

While I'm not against realpolitik at times (for example: raiding Pakistan for Bin Laden), this really is counterproductive. If we don't set an example we'll lose the world, and worse yet, we probably deserve to. The problem is that in this flawed world even with all our flaws we are probably still the best the world has, so our downward slide is a global downward slide and that really should be unacceptable to everyone.

EU is also abdicating stopping of this downward slide nearly 100% to the US, and I really don't think that's a good idea (and again: I say this as someone currently living in Boston who's a huge fan of the US...

Aux USA c'est Edisson avec son énorme Kinetograph encombrant pouvant déservir qu'une seule personne à la fois, par contre Auguste s'en était inspiré pour créer un Cinématographe.  
[Wikipedia](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_et_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re#Inventions) n'est pas une bonne référence mais on y trouve:  
&gt;""Les frères Lumière ont déposé plus de 170 brevets, essentiellement dans le domaine de la photographie. Ils lancent la commercialisation des plaques photographiques instantanées en 1881. La vente de ces plaques dites Plaques Étiquettes-Bleues a fait leur fortune. Mais contrairement à ce qui est affirmé en France, et seulement en France, les frères Lumière n'ont ni tourné le premier film de l'histoire du cinéma, ni même inventé le cinéma. Ce sont les Américains Thomas Edison, l'inventeur du Phonographe, et son assistant William Kennedy Laurie Dickson qui tournent, à l'aide de leur caméra, le Kinétographe, dès 1891 et avant 1895 quelque soixante-dix des premiers films du cinéma. Les frères Lumière leur emboîtent le pas ; le 26 décembre 1894, on peut lire dans le journal Le Lyon républicain, que les frères Lumière « travaillent actuellement à la construction d’un nouveau kinétographe, non moins remarquable que celui d’Edison et dont les Lyonnais auront sous peu, croyons-nous, la primeur ». Les frères Lumière prennent à partir de 1895 une part prépondérante dans le lancement du spectacle de cinéma, prémisses d'une industrie florissante, en présentant à leur tour des films pris avec un appareil qu'ils ont mis au point sous l'appellation de Cinématographe. En 1907, ils sont à l'origine de l'obtention de la couleur sur plaque photographique, dite « autochrome », que Louis Lumière, qui paradoxalement n'aime pas le cinéma considère comme étant sa plus prestigieuse invention, celle à laquelle il a consacré plus de dix années de sa vie.""

You make an extremely good point. I was just thinking the other day of the incredible wealth of new services which I and a great many other people would be really excited to help build IF ONLY I WASN'T SO CONCERNED ABOUT PRIVACY IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE THAT I WOULD BE CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE MISUSED.

Just as many people are naive and stupid about what can be done with new technology, many of my friends, who were among the first to enter this world of the web, and who know it as well as they know their own homes - perhaps more- are in one way or another *pulling back* from their use of digital services, even cell phones, out of anger or frustration.

What may eventually happen is a separating of the world into the closed areas and the open areas. The open areas would protect and nurture the values of freedom and responsibility, and would become areas of knowledge abundance and eventually, economic power and wisdom, and the closed areas would nourish the values of fear and paranoia, as well as false manufactured scarcity, secure in their knowledge that the dangerous creative energy of the open areas would not penetrate to disturb their hegemony, their poor [growing ever poorer, and their rich growing ever richer](http://ideas.repec.org/p/iza/izadps/dp1938.html).

And it wouldn't. Like a tree, it would route itself around the stunted growth areas, growing towards the light.

I would take a ride on the big ferris wheel. It isn't a super intense ride, so you won't feel sick but you do get some great views of both the Wiesn but also of Munich itself.


On that note, I have also had fun at the Feldl's Teufelsrad (a ride thing... Google it), it looks like of lame but it was actually pretty entertaining and fun.


Try the half chicken in the beer tents, they are ridiculously delicious!
Survival tips... 


1. MAKE A MEETING POINT! Even if you all have cellphones, promise to stay together, aren't drinking a lot, it doesn't matter! Make one anyways! From my experience a quick trip to the washroom can become a 3 hour journey. It's really loud and crowded and you and your girlfriend will be drinking so there is a high chance you won't hear your phone... So make a meeting point somewhere just outside of the Wiesn.

2. Eat. A lot. There is a McDonalds and other cheap places to get a bite to eat like a 5 minute walk away from the Wiesn, so you don't have to blow a ton of money on food there (*except for trying a few things such as the chicken). 

3. Don't just drink beer after beer after beer. Mix things up by getting a Bananenweizen (wheat beer mixed with banana juice), it's really tasty but will keep you from getting super  trashed.

In Eastern Europe, the median person is definitely poorer than even during the communist era. The elite (not just the 1%, perhaps the top 10% and that includes most Eastern European redditors) are much richer.

In Romania, the minimum wage has been recently raised to 544 lei (after taxes), that is 120€/month. That's a wage for a deep poverty (physical goods have about the same prices across Europe, just services are cheaper) and more than a third of all workers get that wage.

But the differences in incomes is incredibly high. While most workers get 100-200€/month (the after-tax median is around 200€/month), on some industries, the wages are 10-20 times the minimum wage (I get over 1500€/month after-tax as a programmer), so the educated elite is not complaining for the workers' plight.

When I say this, I'm usually downvoted by other Eastern Europeans belonging to that 10% elite who maybe get a wage similar to mine and say that the workers are doing great. ",0,1370845634,null,0,false,0,cafqwty,t3_1fza6q,t1_cafqwty,t1_cafbe7t,null,1430864387,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Basically, they used the fact that most of the transactions the VSS does are ""invisible"" to implement very shady practices. For example - the VSS needed to buy some realties. So they found some barely suitable, belonging to someone in the clique, and artificially raised the price by huge amounts (think 100%) just before the transaction, but after it was all approved.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"The birthplace of Mozart and Hitler!

My knowledge of Austria really begins in 1683 with the Battle of Vienna, in which the Holy Roman Empire defeated Ottoman forces and halted their advance into Europe, marking the beginning of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. The 19th century's German confederation included parts of Austria-Hungary. There was a tension between Austria-Hungary and Prussia over leadership over the German confederation. Germany eventually unified under Prussian leadership, and the Austro-Hungarian empire began to decline in power, due to a smaller and less industrialized population relative to Germany, Britain, and France. The Habsburgs were the monarchs and among the most influential in Europe.

Austria-Hungary was one of four empires to cease to exist at the end of WWI, a war which was initiated as a result of the assassination of Austria's Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. A few years after taking power in Germany, Hitler annexed Austria as part of Greater Germany. After Germany was defeated in WWII, Austria was occupied and split into several occupation zones as well, until it was eventually reunited around 1955 under the condition that it remain a neutral country in the burgeoning Cold War. It is from here that Austria's tradition of neutrality arose, though many disregard Austrian neutrality since it has been a member state of the EU since 1995, which itself is a power bloc (the same is said for the other ""neutral"" EU countries, which I believe are Ireland, Sweden, and Finland.) Austria is a member of the Eurozone, has a population of around 8 or 9 million, and Vienna is its capital and largest city.

You're digging for silver in a gold mine. My advice: learn to drink wine in France; you'll be doing yourself a huge favor. When I want good beer I go visit friends in Germany or I brew at home. With some highly notable exceptions in the north of France, Corsica, and the areas bordering Germany like Alsace, beer is not a major part of French culture.

More specifically, here's what I can tell you about beer in France:

* The mass-produced French lagers like Kronenbourg and 1664 are direct cousins of the bad mass-produced American beer, with the exception that they aren't entirely undrinkable. And they can be made more palatable by mixing them with lemonade.
* Availability of what you can find in the supermarkets varies dramatically by region. What you will generally find is too light (1664) and too strong (Grimbergen and its ilk). Both varieties are largely unbalanced and offend the palate. 
* There are fantastic regional beers to be found but they are rarely distributed outside of their home departments. Keep and eye out for them!
* There are a few micro-brews that have sprung up around the Rhone-Alps region that are more like what you'd expect from west coast and Rocky Mountain region microbreweries... With the same hit-or-miss quality.
* If it says ""Ch'ti"" on the bottle it's probably very, very good.
* Pietra is a Corsican amber lager with chestnut in it. It's heavenly.",0,1370852651,null,0,false,0,cafs6eg,t3_1fzyg2,t1_cafs6eg,t3_1fzyg2,null,1430863792,7,false,france,t5_2qhjz,7

Edit : Apparemment c'est tiré d'une expression ici expliquée : http://www.indepthinfo.com/horseshoes/and-handgrenades.htm 

&gt;How often has the timeworn expression been intoned, ""Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades!""? Probably millions of times each day. It is easy to see where the expression comes from. Horseshoes is a popular sport where points are scored by tossing a horseshoe close to a stake 40 feet away. Grenades, when they detonate, send shrapnel into any object close-by. The clichéd phrase is often spoken by a bystander after listening to someone complain that he was not quite close enough to do something or win something. For example a basketball shot that takes a spin around a rim and then rolls out of the basket, or a poker hand one card short of a royal flush.

 &gt;Weird Al Yankovic wrote and performed a song called ""Close, but No Cigar"". In it he proposes a character who leaves several wonderful women, each with a minor flaw. He writes ""Are we playing horseshoes, Honey?"" and ""Are we lobbing hand grenades, Kiddo?"" The women were close, but not perfect. In the last stanza, he asks, ""Are we doing government work here?"" reminding us of the old saw, ""Close enough for government work."" This is yet another common cliché about coming close and missing. Yet, including government work in this gives us another twist. Why should something be close enough for government work and not any other kind of work? It is an obvious recognition by society that the government does not operate as efficiently as the private sector.",0,1370853382,null,0,1370854551,0,cafsa7a,t3_1g18v8,t1_cafsa7a,t3_1g18v8,null,1430863742,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2
