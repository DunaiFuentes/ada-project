true,esoteric_reference,null,null,"The program was called AHA International, its an organ of the University of Oregon primarily, but a large number of smaller colleges and universities participate, mostly in the pacific northwest but all across the country as well. I went as a student from a community college in Michigan, and the credits transferred without problem when I came back to the States and enrolled in a 4-year. The University of Oviedo has its own set of programs for foreign students, mostly ERASMUS (european union) but there are students from all over- China, Korea, Japan, the Commonwealth.

My level of Spanish was quite high before I went. I couldn't say with 100% honesty that I was fluent before I went, but I was very close. Staying in Oviedo tipped me over the edge, and I still have the accent. I like it, it sort of keeps me rooted. Often people assume that I'm Castellano and not Gringo if they don't hear me speak English first.

A tricky choice you should contemplate, which hadn't really occurred to me, is whether or not to stay with a host family. It is much more expensive than renting an apartment with other students, however the level of immersion is much higher as well. But you'll be living under someone else's roof, and they might not be compatible with you. I got lucky, my host mom is great, and staying with her helped my language growth tremendously. Plus she's a great cook. 
But renting with friends can be much, much more fun; and it's cheaper too, which will free up more funds for travel. It all depends on what you're looking for. 

I have to say this, it is important: You will not learn the language if you spend all your time with Americans. And the temptation to do so is/will be greater than you can imagine now, and you will find yourself doing it unconsciously. It has to do with being alone (ish) in a strange land; being with other Americans will be immensely comforting. Don't get me wrong, you will form life-long friendships with these people and it will be a beautiful thing, but don't lose sight of the real objective: To grow as a person, and learn the language. No matter where you end up going, Oviedo, Salamanca, wherever, you should look into language exchanges; most universities have programs in place to help language learners meet and practice together. This is how I met a very dear friend of mine who welcomed me into her circle of friends, and helped me learn the language; I helped her with her English, she helped be *become* Spanish.

No matter what you end up doing, go with an open mind and an open heart, and you'll have the time of your life. Sapin is a beautiful country and the people are so kind. There are bad apples of course, don't let your guard down, but you'll be surprised by how little you'll need it. Maybe I'm a touch jealous of you, it's such a special experience. You can really only do it once. I'd very much like to return to Spain someday, and I wish you all the very best! If your experience is half as good as mine, it'll be sublime.

Josè Manuel Barroso was prime minister (president?) at some point in the early 2000s before becoming president (?) of the European Commission (?). He was a Marxist student activist at the time of revolution, but he is a Eurocrat now. He attended a Bilderberg Group meeting before becoming so important in the EU.

The two largest confederated labor unions in the country began a general strike the other day in protest of the government's austerity policies. It took more than 6 months of discussions for them to agree on it. 

According to a recent IMF report, the Troika (IMF, ECB, EC) had recommended that the government cut spending by ~~400 billion~~(??) eur, but the government took the initiative to cut ~~850 billion~~(??). When people got angry about the cuts, the government had originally said they were under pressure by the Troika, but the reality is that the ruling parties were taking advantage of political climate tolerant of structural change.

The last prime minister's name is Socrates. His engineering degree was fake, so after losing an election he went to the Sorbonne to get a real one. He appears once a week on a popular political commentary program in a segment known as ""A Opinao de Socrates.""

Yet, based on the sources you gave me and your former comments you left me me confused. Let me emphasis first my basic understanding of the prime conflict in Ukrainian politics.

  * There is a pro-russian lobby, that is mostly located in the east of the country. They want a strong alliance with russia and support e.g. russian language as a national language etc ...
  * There is a nationalist movement, wanting the country to be independent from russian influence (only ukrainian should be national language / the only exception should be made for java and assembler). These movements are often called pro-european.

Now to my confusion: When you mentioned that *German mass-meadia suck Putin's dick*, I assumed, that you are accusing them taking the russian side. As your sources state, quite the opposite is true. German media might be biased towards the nationalistic/pro-european movement, and allow people to explain ukrainian foreign policy, who are corrupt.

To the ""Timoshenko case"". First of all, I do not have an own opinion. But the information expressed by German media, is exactly the same as the official German foreign policy and the statements of the EU parlament. All of them criticise that the conviction of Timoshenko + parts of her former government is politically motivated and not fair justice. I do not know what an *accurate reporting* would mean.

Timoschenko is usually labeled as a Ukrainian nationalist/pro-west/pro-European politician. And this is totally false. Gas contracts that she pushed through were the culmination of her efforts to sell Ukraine into slavery to Gazprom, she almost succeeded.

Current government is indeed has its base of support in the eastern/southern parts of the country that have strong post-soviet nostalgy and pro-russian sentiments. But, in practical terms, current government is the most anti-Kremlin government we had in years. They shit on the tymoshenko's gas slavery contracts, construct LNG terminal, develop gas fields off-shore, let Chevron/Shell to develop shale gas in Ukraine, implemented several important laws that were required to get closer to the EU, etc.

German mass-media rarely, if ever, report that: Tymoschenko is a gas oligarch with close ties to Putin; that she abused her powers to push through a gas slavery contract; that she is not really sick; that she gets treatment like no other prisoner (in fact, her live in prison is much better than a lot of people have outside). They forget to mention that it was she who destroyed the Orange coalition, she halted pro-market, pro-european reforms.

Her buddy Lazarenko sat in American prison for many years and she narrowly escaped his fate only thanks to formalistic detailes. She also faced corruption charges in Russia.

Out current ""united opposition"" consists of a Neo-Nazi anti-democratic, anti-european, illiberal ""Freedom/Svoboda"" party, BYT, UDAR. Do european/german mass-media remind their listeners that ukrainian opposition parties endorse a neo-nazi one as their political partner?

The only thing I didn't like is how the author seems a little bit myopic, still, about how elitist the background was of the people she describes, including her own family. ""Sending your daughters to finishing school in Germany was the thing to do"" in those times? For some, maybe ... 

I mean, on the one hand, explaining the attraction of Germany, she does seem to be keenly aware of how that appeal had to do with the British nobility/aristocracy. ""My mother-in-law's family was typical of aristocratic attitudes of this period,"" she says, and: ""don't forget that George V. changed the name of his family from ""Saxe-Coburg and Gotha"" to ""Windsor"" only in 1917, during the First World War. There were still aristocratic connections and friendships to Germany between the wars.""

But on the other hand, she seems to have a blind spot for this aspect, claiming that these women ""didn't know any Jews, they were upper-middle class English girls"". Upper-middle class? When we're talking about families where, as she casually mentions, the father was holding forth in the House of Lords (then still a hereditary position)? When the girls in question got to spend their time skiing, going to the opera, going to parties and being celebrated and, notably, ""hanging out with Hitler and Hess""? They were firmly upper class, my dear, not some kind of euphemistic ""upper-middle class"" - and so, presumably, are you. Merely saying that ""Of course, they were not poor, the exchange rate was favorable for them,"" seems like a serious understatement.

The troublesome part of that, even if it's just a small part, is that this makes anti-semitism seem more widely spread in Britain at the time - and therefore more contextually excusable - than it was. Yes, true, ""it was an anti-Semitic time, not only in Germany,"" and in Britain the far right, the brown shirts, Oswald Mosley, were on the rise too. But Mosley failed to get mass support, in the end, and while Rachel's aristocratic family was fawning over Hitler, many in the working class [were fighting those brown shirts in the street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cable_Street).

  * The view on Tymoschenko had become more ambiguous lately (I read many positive and some negative articles about her). But independent of her political heritage, political discussions shouldn't be made at the court. If she was corrupt, she deserves a fair trial. This is not seen by German Media + German foreign ministry/ EU parlament. I admit a bias, but wouldn't say solely German media is affected.

  * The new political hero is Vitali Klitschko. German media and the public loves him. They let him explain Ukraine politics for us, and are extremely biased towards him. (However, I met some Ukrainians in Norway, who share this bias :) 

  * I cannot remember reading too much about Neo-Nazi movements in Ukraine. The focus in media coverage are anti-homosexual riots, partly covered by the government. Not sure if this is a topic in Ukraine, but in German media this is reported frequently. Just Russia and Hungary seems to be in a worse situation.

  * Generally I would say, that German media is critical against Gasprom and Putin ... The focus however does not lie in Ukraine ",0,1371209486,null,0,false,0,caiq84a,t3_1ga2cd,t1_caiq84a,t1_caipl1v,null,1430812870,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I have been buying all of these reds for years and they are tasty, inexpensive wines. All of them come in different price ranges, the cheapest (crianza/vino joven) is usually between €4-6, although prices fluctuate. Also, they come from different Denominaciones de Orígen: Rioja, Priorat, Ribera del Duero.  Just try different bottles out until you find the ones you like best. When you find which D.O. (or grapes) that you like best, try a bottle or two above the €6 mark if you can afford it. Keep in mind that above €6 most wines are fantastic, above €10 they are amazing and above €20 you are drinking the elixir of the gods. Big supermarkets like Al Campo, E. Leclerc, Carrefour, give you the best selection and price for wines.

As far as white wines, most of the ones I really have gotten to know and enjoy are from the Canaries, where I used to live until recently, but are hard to find on the mainland. From the mainland, the albariños from Galicia are good.

Here are some links to threads talking about good inexpensive wines in the supermarkets in Spain, check them out if you want, but you won't be disappointed with the ones I mentioned above. Salud!

The charges are public and plain for anyone to read about. There's nothing overblown about them. The circumstances are also known. Anyway, these are the actual accusations:

* Sexual assault x 2
* Rape (sex without consent due to altered state of consciousness)

*Back in 1984, a rebellious,17-year-old, punked-out Ulli Lust set out for a wild hitchhiking trip across Italy, from Naples through Verona and Rome and ending up in Sicily. Twenty-five years later, this talented Austrian cartoonist has looked back at that tumultuous summer and delivered a long, dense, sensitive,and minutely observed autobiographical masterpiece.*

*Miraculously combining a perfect memory for both emotional and physical detail with the sometimes painful lucidity two and half decades’ distance have brought to her understanding of the events, Lust meticulously shows the who, where, when, and how (specifically, how an often penniless young girl can survive for months on the road) of a sometimes dangerous and sometimes exhilarating journey. Particularly haunting is her portrait of her fellow traveler, the gangly, promiscuous devil-may-care Edi who veers from being her spunky, funny best friend in the world to an out-of-control lunatic with no consideration for anything but her own whims and desires.*

The issue here is with producers, film studios and production companies being able to operate overseas with less bureaucracy, tax and tariffs.  It's about the French wanting to protect domestic industry by making it more competitive.  The UK actively works to make the UK more attractive to this industry by providing certain tax credits and exemptions, like with the New Star Wars franchise which is coming to the UK, on the basis that not only does it create jobs, but creates a specialist field, studios and expertise, an infrastructure of skills, which is left behind long after the initial filming is over.   

Media should not be taken out of a free trade agreement because it means that US companies would be far more likely to film in Europe.  The 'problem' is that it is always going to favour the Anglosphere more to the detriment of non-English speaking media.  It's not that they will stop non-English speaking production, just that it will make it more difficult to compete.  Then again it is already struggling to compete.

The counter argument is that government can't control a tide of culture like music or Hollywood, and a government trying to put a thumb in the dyke is a long line of thumbs.   That and it is punitive against the UK and R.o.Ireland, or others with a strong English speaking presence, for little reason other than they already speak English.

There are plenty of other European countries that stand to gain a lot from having media involved in a free trade agreement.  Countries which might be appealing to Hollywood because of the locations and natural landscapes they can provide - countries which aren't nearly as concerned about protecting their spoken language or domestic industry (because it is not under threat, either because the language is less under threat or the industry has less to lose); German speakers, Spanish speakers, Portuguese speakers, and Scandinavians.  It's only really France that risks losing lingua franca - which, if truth be told, they already have.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;We need to build up an industry that finds ways to make European culture more appealing to the average person, inside and outside of Europe.

We can never compete with big budgets. Not even French can, and their government spends money on that like crazy. 

In Finland, the biggest budget EVER was Iron Sky with something like 8 million euros. Most films are done with 2. The film was spoken in English (a huge concession!). It's set in New York (because nothing ever happens in EU). That was the best we can probably ever manage, and that film was still only a flash in a pan.

We speak strange languages. Nobody outside EU is going to be interested in watching films that were originally Finnish, Swedish, German or French (or what have you). If a local film does great in Europe, Hollywood makes a new version where the plot is moved to USA. It will never be given a place in theatres on its own.

&gt;All the while the US produces masses of cultur, many very bad and some very good. In Europe, we then produce copies of what the US invented culturally (web sites, tv shows, movies, etc.)

But lets not talk about that. Lets talk about the fact that people need to be able to value their own cultures. If all the films, tv-shows etc. are based in New York, people will start to think New York as the standard. People will take cues on how to behave from those shows, as they lack better sources. Seeing second-gen immigrant Somalis acting like Afro-Americans because that's the only role models they get is really depressing, to give a fairly easy example. 

We need local TV-shows that showcase local problems and show that stuff happens near us. Shows that tell us about how we we deal with immigration (which means Somalis among the cast and shown as part of the society), about our own local problems caused from living where we do (like what happens when your wife decides you need a digital TV adapter RIGHT NOW and the closest store is hundreds of kilometres away over frozen ground?*), historical films about OUR history, not about killing Indians or conquering the West. 

And so on. This stuff is important. While TV should not be used in lieu of school, it can be used to complement. To tell about our society, our ideals, our problems. Easy example to illustrate; when you show boobs in non-sexual context EU-films, you are telling; ""this isn't a big thing"". If kids only see American films, they think boobs ARE a big thing, a sexual thing, and thus the next generation will act accordingly. 

Sure, the stuff is partly copying, because there are only so many ways you can do the big story lines, only so many things that work on screen. But devil is in the details, as the saying goes. Think, perhaps, Stargate and Doctor Who; both are pretty similar shows, but for the fact that the first mentioned is more about military superiority when the latter is about using your brain and abhorring guns. And this detail makes all the difference.

&gt;The only modern cultural good we seem to be good in are video games.

The film was spoken in English (a huge concession!). It's set in New York (because nothing ever happens in EU). That was the best we can probably ever manage, and that film was still only a flash in a pan.

Iron Sky had a pan-European budget. It's famous for managing to get money from most of the EU governments. I get your point, but I want some of that merit :). 

&gt;Our video games -- how European are they,really?.......We aren't even the heroes in our own stories! The only exemption I can think of is the Assassin's Creed-series.

Well, Witcher and Metro 2033 are some other exceptions. And pretty soon video games makers will realize that blowing up Paris is cooler than Washington, so they'll start doing that, only 10 years after Hollywood started filming in Europe.

I agree with most of your points, but you forgot something. After 10 000 movies and tv shows about how the US military is here to save you, you start believing it. It would be nice to have movies about those people that are being killed by GI Joe and Drone Joe.

Probably the rest of EU as well. These are important to make films that will probably never gain popularity outside the smallish home markets. 

Britain isn't on this boat, as you have big markets not just in America and Ireland but in the rest of EU as well. Top Gear and Doc Who and what not. But the rest of EU can't say the same. We can get the jokes, we can understand the language (or have it subtitled) -- but you would never watch German scifi-series, no matter how good production values, plot etc. it would have.

L'idea è estremamente semplice: anziché avere la scelta puramente della lingua d'impostazione, ciascuno user dovrebbe avere la possibilità di scegliere in quali lingue vuole visualizzare i commenti. In tale maniera potrebbero coesistere thread paralleli in varie lingue all'interno dello stesso post. Ovviamente per ragioni di fattibilità politica il default sarebbe solo inglese, ma sarebbe una risorsa preziosa per user non-anglofoni, e darebbe luogo a scambi interculturali imprevedibili, perché magari uno pensa di parlare solo con chi capisce la propria lingua, ma invece si avrebbe una permeabilità variabile da cui emergono punti di vista completamente aliene tra loro (come quelli americano e italiano sulla cucina appunto) ma nonostante ciò in contatto in modo meno tragico della solita battaglia di upvote e downvote, in cui vince sempre il conformismo alla cultura anglofona.

Cosa che vedo molto poco su questi thread-battaglia è la ricerca di una reale comprensione tra le due parti. Invece proprio il lavoro di traduzione (che molta gente come me fa volentieri per puro piacere) coinvolge il maggior numero possibile di persone che hanno la competenza e conoscenza adeguate per far emergere un po' di verità e riconciliazione.

L'unico problema è che non si può moderare uno forum in cui non si capiscono tutti i commenti. poi non saprei a chi proporre l'idea. voi che ne dite?

Secondo me, questo dev'essere specificato o a fianco nel subreddit, o addirittura ricetta per ricetta, se richiede ingredienti particolari.

Altra cosa (forse meno problematica), bisogna stare attenti come tradurre i nomi degli ingredienti. Ad esempio bacon e pancetta (sempre per stare in tema). Bacon è la pancia del maiale solo negli Stati Uniti. In UK si usa di solito carne dal dorso o dai fianchi.

Here is the problem, I'll use simple numbers so it is easier to understand.  
  
Let's assume there are 100 bitcoins in circulation. These sell for $200 per bitcoin. However, mining bitcoin 101 will not cost $200 but let's say $400 in power and computer cost. In order for this to be interesting to do, the price of bitcoins must surpass the cost of mining the next bitcoin, else one will lose $200 on the mining alone. So, the general price of a coin will have to surpass $400 for it to be interesting to mine the new coin. How do you increase the cost of a coin? 2 ways:  
1. Introduce an artificial scarcity  
2. Increase the demand for the coin.  
  
Now, let's say the price of a coin, through a combination of 1. and 2., has ended up at $450. Now mining the new coin will bring a profit of $50 and the coin is mined.   
  
Now the cost of a bitcoin is $450 but mining bitcoin 102 will cost $550, hence it will result in losing $100 just from the mining alone. Price must increase in order for the next coin to be mined.  
  
If you came in early in the Ponzi scheme, you paid cents for a bitcoin. These people have horded the coin and can easily change the amount in circulation for normal trade and create scarcity. You, coming in on the top, paying a high price, is directly sending you money to the ones who got the coin cheap.

L'idea é bella, ma é un'impresa impossibile.

La cucina italiana é diventata tale perché dietro si porta con sé la storia dell'intera nazione. Anni di evoluzione in cucina, dall'impero romano (vini, olio, formaggi, ecc.) ai giorni nostri, plasmata e arricchita dalle carestie (sembra un paradosso), dalla famiglie di contadini che non buttavano via nulla, alle regge di tutti i re, feudatari, principi, che hanno governato le varie zone d'Italia e che ricevevano piatti nuovi e raffinati dai propri cuochi, sino ad arrivare alle tradizioni religiose con i pranzi domenicali (e tutte le altre feste).
La cucina italiana racchiude l'ingegno e i sacrifici dei nostri antenati.
La cucina italiana é tale grazie alla nostra storia e alla nostra posizione al centro del Mediterraneo.

Gli anglofoni non **capiranno** mai la cucina italiana se non ne **capiscono** la storia. Per questo troverai sempre quello che mette l'aglio ovunque perché lo ha sentito in TV, o il ketchup sulla pizza margherita perché é abituato a mangiare hamburger e hot-dog.

Gli americani hanno avuto una storia diversa e per questo mangiano diversamente da noi. La loro storia poggia le basi sulla distruzione dei nativi d'America. Hanno distrutto il seme della loro storia.
Loro hanno inventato il consumismo!
Noi invece non buttiamo una maglietta se non la indossano minimo 3 figli e non la buttiamo nemmeno dopo perché la usiamo come panno per spolverare e pulire i vetri.

Insegnare agli americani come cucinare italiano vuol dire estirparli dalla loro storia e usanze e trapiantarli con forza nella storia d'Italia.

La cucina italiana é un modo di vivere.

Non so se mi sono spiegato...

La cucina italiana é un nostro patrimonio e una nostra ricchezza, perché dovremmo donare agli altri qualcosa di cosí importante?
Piuttosto esportiamo il nostro prodotto finito, che é meglio.

Dare le nostre ricette sarebbe per loro come dare a tutti la ricetta della CocaCola...

You kind of need alternatives. Let's use films as an example.

Let's say that you need 2 million viewers to break even. You calculate that there are maybe three million people interested in this film, so you can probably break even, if you get all the three million, you make moderate winnings and can go to make the next film. 

The day your film is coming to theatres, similar US-film also launched. It also needed two million people to break even, but thanks to larger markets it has already gotten 50 million around USA and EU. But it robs you that one million (people only go to films that often, and they don't always choose the home-made version); you can only break even.

You note that all the films you are interested in doing have similar films in the US pipeline. You figure that 2 million is now your BEST figure. And you can only break even. Sure, you can cut the budget, but it doesn't help that much and it would show in reviews, essentially making this a plus/minus-thing.

This is where most EU-governments step in and help fund the next film enough that that 2 million-viewers can be seen as ""moderate winnings"". This is what France fears is getting banned.

""Don't go watch US films"" isn't going to help. They're on the market. They're GOING to cut on the market share, no matter what. 

Without intervention, we ONLY get those ""Captain Murica VIII""-type films.

There's nothing to choose from.

Luluwilson usa la parola idiota e, sinceramente, sono d'accordo. Considero idiota una persona che assume delle sostanze psicotrope senza avere la coscienza e l'intelligenza per poterle gestire.

Non si puo' cancellare il fatto che questa persona si sia intossicata e abbia fatto una cosa da idiota che eventualmente (e con una buona dose di sfortuna e disgrazia) ha portato al suo decesso.

Condivido la tua volonta' di portare rispetto, ma io porto rispetto ai vivi esattamente come ai morti.

Non condivido il fatto di dover portare maggior rispetto a un morto che a un vivo. La morte di un individuo non puo' cancellare le sue azioni e su queste si basano i commenti in questo thread.

Buying those packets from USA is cheaper than producing your own shows. So they put Game of Thrones/Walking Dead/whatever on prime-time and put Garage Wars/whatever to fill the less popular spots.

That way they can get the low-hanging fruits, try to do some additional fishing on the low-periods and not contribute anything to the local culture (after all, why put a lot of money on a local show that might flop, instead of buying a sure hit like GoT, which packet costs about the same amount).

Anyway. Every industry needs regulation.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;You say that as if it was a good thing, everybody is a little poorer to subsidise films nobody cares about and that's good somehow because it was made here?

First; little poorer. Film industry brings a lot of jobs, directly and indirectly. If tax money is put into production that takes place inside the home borders, all the money will return back to the state coffers in few months. On the way they employ a lot of people and may even bring money from outside the state.

Second; subsiding films nobody wants to see. Usually people are interested in seeing films made at home. But not all aren't. And when you target only certain audience, there's of course a risk -- which Hollywood doesn't share. You're saying that because a light-weight pugilist and heavy-weight pugilist are both best-of-the-line and both are doping-free, then the fight is fair. 

&gt;So you're going to make it more difficult to watch US films because you don't like them?

Have you had any problems seeing US-films wherever you live? I'm going to guess no. The idea of the government aid isn't to ban US-films, it's to give local films the same subjective aid that Hollywood-films enjoy due to larger target group.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;You don't need big budgets to create culture.

Well, true. But films are hugely expensive. You need a big team; not just actors, but cameramen, SFX-people, make-up artists etc. Even if you do a low-key romcom set in a small village, it's still hugely expensive.

And true, with every additional euro (or dollar) you get less bang per buck. But a 100 000 euro film is completely different from 1 million euro film, which is completely different beast from a 10 million euro film. Somewhere between 10 and 100 million the amount of money starts to be less important, but very few films in Europe get over 10 million, so this is kind of a moot point.

And 10 million isn't big. 

It's also worth mentioning that even USA gives a lot of government aid to Hollywood, and their situation is far better than ours.

&gt; Did Jazz receive big money? Did RocknRoll at its beginnings? 

You can create music by yourself and then record / play it to people very cheaply indeed. You don't need a lot to money to ""buy yourself into the game"". The same can't be said about film/TV-industry. Video games can be a kin to the either music or films, depending on the platform and the time period we're talking of.

&gt;Do video games receive government money?

Well, UK promised tax cuts last year, but EC was against them. [Apparently same rules govern that as film industry](http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/uk-game-tax-breaks-in-doubt-as-european-commission-launches-investigation/0114159). To get money, EC thinks, you have to make games that are culturally unique, not ""global"" (eg. aping Americans).

&gt;The ""culture"" problem Europe has is that we only look at the past. If its not like it was 50 years ago, then its not ""European culture"". Every new idea is labeled ""American"" and vilified.

Do our films look only in the past? There are no European films set in the present or future, is what you're saying? But let me tell you this; if you are making a video game that COULD take place anywhere, and you decide to put it in New York, you aren't really interesting in drawing from European culture (or adding to it) -- but instead from and to American. Can you argue against this?

That's just what's seen, what's not seen is the money that could be spent but won't be spent by the people. On the way they employ a lot of people and may even bring money from outside the state.

&gt;Usually people are interested in seeing films made at home.

Does not compute. You just said everybody was watching US films and not EU stuff and now you're saying that what the people want is EU stuff.

Anyway, what the people want, they can choose on their own.

&gt;You're saying that because a light-weight pugilist and heavy-weight pugilist are both best-of-the-line and both are doping-free, then the fight is fair. 

What I'm saying is that we shouldn't be an autarky. If the Americans make better films, great for them, we should then focus on other things, it's called comparative advantage.

&gt;Have you had any problems seeing US-films wherever you live? I'm going to guess no.

Considering the current trend, I'm guessing we'll soon have problems.

true,literocola431,null,null,"**Pickpocketing and Generalities:**

Naples is shady as pickpocketing goes, but really any major area where tourism congregates or where people are arriving and confused.. Also, whenever you take a train, always keep your possessions in sight. If you have a backpack you can put it above your seat. Lots of peoples bags walk off trains without them, i hear it all the time from my clients. When I get out of the train and move through the station, i put my wallet in my front pocket, and walk like you know where you are going. Makes you less of a target. 

If you take the metro in Rome, take your bag off and hold it between your legs. You should do this on the bus too. Occasionally people have had their bags sliced by a razor without them knowing, and things pulled through and thus stolen.
 
Outside of bars (im assuming you are going to get drunk on this trip) people sometimes come up to you and chat you up. Sometimes this is a good thing, sometimes its a bad thing. Ive had guys come up to me and talk about soccer and as soon as they touch you for more than 5 seconds, somethings up (either shits about to get freaky or they have their hand in your back pocket). Then again, Ive had girls come up to me and chat me up simply because im dashingly handsome. 

If you can, just go out on the town with some id (could be a photocopy of your passport), a phone, and the cash you want to spend. Its real easy to spend a shitload of money at a bar here, so by only bringing what you can spend you eliminate that chance. Keep 10e in your shoe for a taxi home if everything goes to shit.

**Travel -Trains vs Hitchiking:**


You can honestly get everywhere on Regional trains in Italy. They stop at many stations, and run frequently every day but sunday. They cost very little (in the neighborhood of 5-12e to get from city to city). You can find all the trains listed [here](http://www.trenitalia.com), and you can buy your tickets in the station 10 minutes before at one of the automated machines (for these you need cash or a debit card with a pin code to operate). You dont see many hitchikers in italy because its so easy to take the train. You do see a lot of prostitutes at weigh stations, so be careful you are not confused suchly.

**Phones:**


Do you have an unlocked smartphone? If you can manage to get your phone unlocked, Wind has a good service. You can get something like 300 texts, 300 minutes, and unlimited internet for only 10-20e per month. To have internet at your fingertips while traveling in italy is a very good thing and worth the expense. Usually the sim card is 10e and the monthly cost is as listed above. A good provider is called Wind (also Tim has very similar coverage and rates). Every month from when you purchase and fill the phone, your account will be debited for the stated cost of the plan. If it goes unpaid, the plan shuts off, and they dont charge you until you start it back up again. You refill these phones at any tabacco store (the ones with a T-sign outside the building). Go in and ask for a ricarica (pronounced RE:-car-eka (as in eurEKA)) da [Phone company name], per [cost in increments of 5,10,25).

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;If your indie film was worth watching...

The sad thing is that you have to know this two to four years BEFORE you can start selling the film to consumers. And like some Hollywood-director said in an interview ""only a stupid person puts his own money into a film -- you can not be objective on its quality"". I'm rephrasing, of course.

&gt;Besides, with the rise digital distribution doing well at the box office isn't nearly as important as it once was.

No, but box office is still PRETTY important. It's also fast. You want to recoup your costs in months after the release, not YEARS after the release. After all, if you're in it for the long-term, you would want long-term winnings instead of short-term winnings -- and they ought to be bigger, not smaller.

&gt;..and people will buy them if they have a quality film

In theory, yes. But look what happened to Iron Sky in Britain (with Revolver) and USA. Or actually, pretty much everywhere outside the places where they got funding from (usually from public parties, which also helped make it into theatres).

&gt;There's myriad streaming services popping up all over the world that are hungry for content... There has really never been a better time to be an indie studio. Bottom line, if you can't stay in business without help from your government, you have no business being in business.

If you're creating a Finnish-spoken film set in Finland, you are probably interested in having it succeed in Finland. Probability that someone outside Finland would be interested in a film about...say...never-good farmers in 19th Century Finland feuding over a girl, talking obscure dialect, isn't very good. 

And going into that without any help from government isn't easy. Making films isn't easy or cheap, and even ""winning big"" isn't much when the country only has 5+ million people in it.

I said that US-films take their part of they pie. Just because you like local films, doesn't mean you don't like American films.

But because Hollywood deals from a position of strength and local industry from weaker position, this dichotomy would on the long run ruin the local industry without outside help (doesn't help that America also funds their film industry from public coffers directly and indirectly - so the game was rigged from the start).

&gt;If the Americans make better films, great for them, we should then focus on other things, it's called comparative advantage.

Films are a big part in upkeeping a culture. We don't want a situation where Norwegian youngsters ask cops about their Miranda-rights, a situation where Somali-immigrants emulate African-Americans (""yo yo niggaaaa!!""), where boobs get sexualised as they are in America, where we slowly get American values (for want of opposite voice) through immersion.

That being said, this trade deal was never going to take aim at cultural subsidies, Hollande is just making a big deal out of it for domestic political purposes. The deal is more about streamlining regulation between the two markets in stuff like pharmaceuticals, environmental stuff, etc.. Which brings with it it's own set of worries, but film subsidies were most likely never even going to be mentioned until Hollande brought it up haha.

In Britain, a company named Revolver bought the rights to show it, then decided that it would be more profitable to run some American film instead. When the producers complained about agreement violations, Revolver screened the film TWICE (that's for the whole country). There was a lot of interest on the film, and it went directly to DVD... few months later. The producers lost a lot money (that they could have really have done with). At least, that's how I remember the story going.

The film wasn't shown in USA at all outside some festivals. Apparently it later got into Netflix and then some group or another got riled over the ""Sarah Palin is a Nazi""-storyline. 

&gt;Hopefully Harma becomes available soon too, and if it's as popular as you say it is then I'm sure it will.

It was very popular in Finland. I don't know much about Netflix, but do me a favour and check how many Finnish-spoken films do you have available in Netflix at US.

Yeah, we tried that during the 60s-70s. Turns out that when you make films without any profit interest, you make films that nobody wants to see. So now we cover certain percentage of the budget instead and let it run along the normal capitalist lines otherwise. The films compete on the marketplace with Marvel-films without any additional help from the government after the initial funding was given. 

Mainly the point is to help make the films reality. We don't have big studios here in Finland nor possibly to subsidise films with million-tax cuts like they do in US. Doing this makes it possible to do stuff that needs some funding; for example, those costumes on actors in Härmä weren't cheap.

&gt;The imagery in the trailer is pretty good, except for that fact that it's in Finnish, why would it need protection?

During that period 1,250 million people immigrated from Portugal. One of the countries that welcomed Portugal was Luxembourg, they were blooming and needed urgently man power so they offered shelter and manual works for the Portuguese.

The problem of the US is not the lack of development but rather the network of influencial lobbyists that populate Washington ( we bitch about EU lobbying but compare it to the US and it is a kindergarten).

And as a German I am the allegedly winner of the EURO but how did I win exactly? In the 90s german wages were nearly on the same level as scandinavian wages. After the introduction of the EURO Germany was not able to compete anymore, what  followed was a
recession, a decade of frozen wages and a strong reduction in social security. Now we have a shrinking middle class and a strong low income sector that is partly subsidized by the state. Those who did profit were not the average citizens but rather the shareholders of the large companies. Which can be said about many of those trade deals.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Oh, so you're focusing specifically on the bad and completley ignoring the good? lmao

Yes, because that's my point. From the very first post I made. TV-shows are bought in packets. The packets include one good show and several bad shows. The stations buy the good show (like Game of Thrones) for prime time and end with a big stack of bad stuff they can put on air for the time when they figure they aren't going to get big viewer numbers anyway. So, instead of having to think any other programming, thus putting out nonsense like I listed above. 

The legislation is there so that instead of showing the worst shit America has to offer, the stations would have to buy several packets from different countries so they would never get to the bottom of the barrel. 

&gt; And what's wrong with Dog Whisperer or Alaskan State Troopers?

Dog Whisperer has a solid ground, but IIRC half of every episode seems to be recaps and social porn. Alaskan State Troopers doesn't have any value to Finnish people; it's probably ok show from American perspective; it tells you about one of the 50 states. But what is Alaska to Finnish person? They show this stuff because showing it is free -- not because it's good or it's popular with viewers.

&gt;And you say those shows ""arn't worth anything to anyone"", but people still watch them, don't they? They might not be the same quality , but to say they're useless just because you don't like them is conceited as shit.

Nah, they're pretty universally seen as shit. But they get most of the money from prime-time, so if they don't use any money outside the prime-time, then any money they make from ads are income. You only need few hundred viewers to make it worth the time. Essentially it's a question between taking a risk and buying more programming, taking even bigger risk and MAKING programming and not taking a risk at all and just being satisfied with the small pickings.

&gt;I do have a problem with the good shit coming out of those countries...they are damaging my country's culture and should be restricted...I mean...that's the logic you're using as well, right?

It isn't. 

My logic is that stations are cleaning the bottoms of the barrels because they make most of their money on prime-time, which they clean with Walking Dead and the like. Which is all very good, but television should also do more than just entertain -- and this means showing varied programming to many target groups. Stations don't really have interest on this without regulation. So, outside the prime-time (when they can show Walking Dead), they should also show EU-programming (like perhaps Doctor Who or Top Gear) and local programming (like Finnish Border Patrol or something else similar that I just made up). Let's call it taking care of the community where they operate, ok? :)

&gt;But please, only focus on the bad. Why talk about the good? It's not like protectionism is going to fuck EVERYTHING up including the good...

In this case, the main point of protectionism is to make sure that people get more varied view of culture than just the American one. We don't want kids thinking that cops read Miranda-rights in EU (as they might well think if they only see American programming); we don't want them thinking that showing boobs is dirty and sexual (as they might well do if they only see American programming) and we may also want to subtly let them know stuff about their own society, like how cops operate here, what border patrol does, how young people spend their free time in local cities etc. These aren't stuff that teenagers (or even older people) would naturally see on their daily lives, so they should learn (or have chance to learn) it in telly. And also how the other states operate (similar reasons, as we are in the same Union, now). 

But it only works if we have local and EU programming. And we can only have that if the stations show it. Seeing as this stuff is more expensive than showing Alaskan Cops, some regulation must be done.

&gt;EU–Canada trade agreement threatens fracking bans

That doesn't answer my question. Where does it say that if a FTA goes through that a company is allowed to disobey and disregard a country's sovereignty and start mining their shit? If you don't want fracking, fine, ban it in your country. What's the problem? 

&gt;Yep that is also what they told the spanish and the italians when they joined the monetary union with Germany.
And as a German I am the allegedly winner of the EURO but how did I win exactly? In the 90s german wages were nearly on the same level as scandinavian wages. After the introduction of the EURO Germany was not able to compete anymore, what followed was a recession, a decade of frozen wages and a strong reduction in social security. Now we have a shrinking middle class and a strong low income sector that is partly subsidized by the state. Those who did profit were not the average citizens but rather the shareholders of the large companies. Which can be said about many of those trade deals.

Here's the thing. **This is a Free Trade Agreement, not a Fiscal &amp; Monetary Union**. The situations are completely different. And something tells me it's a shit load beneficial for you to have a FTA with America instead of India or Mexico if your worried about that, or you know, being forced into China's Economic Sphere of Influence if this falls through..since this is one of the few, if not only, viable way to compete against the rising Asian Juggernauts.

It is, at that. Well spotted! But there was a Finnish equivalent beforehand, iirc.

The directive only applies to free/open channels that are essentially getting the right to broadcast from the state for free/peanuts against following said directive.

The thing is, making domestic shit dirt cheap is still more expensive than showing Dog the Bounty Hunter, which is also shit.

I don't think I've blamed America for that? I've simply noted that this is the situation due to calculations done by some tv-studio heads here in Finland and the rest of the EU, and this regulation is how we avoid being hurt by it. 

&gt;Shouldn't you be blaming your own country's entrepreneurs and corporations instead of us?

I am. That's why I am so enthusiastic about the regulations (when they work -- FOX got some special allowance for 2012/2013 which makes them a very good example of how all channels would look like if the regulation would be abandoned). 

&gt;You can't get rid of one and keep the other.

Sure I can. We artificially cut the broadcast time in half, making it necessary for the studio to show only the stuff they think the public finds most interesting. Then we put them choosing the other half from European programming. Again, they can choose whatever they like inside these limits.

If they think that what people want to see is Garage Wars, then they can show Garage Wars. But I bet they opt showing Walking Dead.

The regulation isn't banning any programming, you note.

No but the US has way more power to enforce the interests of their lobbyists. Also I do believe that US lobbyists are very good prepared and organized. While professional lobbying is relatively new in developing nations they have already perfectionated it.

&gt;It may or may not cause Cancer? That's your argument? And you are democratic. And as a democratic society, and hopefully as one who believes in democratic values, you can understand why global famine and tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of deaths might be..idk...a bad thing. 

There are some studies that show it causes cancer others that say it is save. It is disputed. 

Using GMO´s will not prevent famines. Every monoculture is at risk even if it has been engineered to be resistant against several deseases, there is always a chance of a sudden mutation or a adaption and then using only one kind of i.e. corn seed can be very dangerous.  Diversity is a  better way of risk reduction.

&gt;Horsemeat in British burgers? No meat in Icelandic MEAT PIES? Or idk, how Germany has triple the cases of Mad Cow Disease as Canada? 

Not denying that, but does this really make you want to join a trade union with the EU? Knowing that the next horse steak might be lying on your platter? Let the organized crime roam freely in another country?

&gt;That doesn't answer my question. Where does it say that if a FTA goes through that a company is allowed to disobey and disregard a country's sovereignty and start mining their shit? If you don't want fracking, fine, ban it in your country. What's the problem? 

It already happened in the EU. Vattenfall is sueing Germany because of the nuclear exit.  Vattenfalls rights are protected by international contracts and they have legal options that none of their german competitors have. So they will get royally compensated. 

&gt;

Also [ Canada has been sued by US-companys](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2012/11/23/fracking-ban-nafta-lawsuit.html) because of fracking bans. Their rights are as well protected by the NAFTA agreements.

&gt;And something tells me it's a shit load beneficial for you to have a FTA with America instead of India or Mexico if your worried about that, or you know, being forced into China's Economic Sphere of Influence if this falls through..since this is one of the few, if not only, viable way to compete against the rising Asian Juggernauts. 

Actually trade with the BRICS is going quite well.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Which languages get the preference? You couldn't possibly teach all European languages to every school child in Europe.

You don't have to. You just have to make sure that the taught languages overlap with what they teach in other countries (every European should speak at least three languages, says EU). If you understand English, Swedish, Russian, German, French and Spanish you should be able to survive anywhere. Learning even half gives you so much overlap that you should survive in most situations.

The important languages are English, French, German and Russian. Basically English and something else. 

I speak Finnish as native language, English more-or-less excellently, I have passable Swedish and I can read Estonian and most other Scandinavian languages without much trouble. I can read some German and French (try to figure out more, but I was never good with languages and I didn't pick these up at school -- but I'm reaching the level where I can read comics without dictionary). Most Finns do better than I do. My father is native-language level in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Swedish in addition to Finnish. My brothers speak German in addition to Swedish and English.

&gt;You make your choice to maintain your native language

Finnish is the whole heart of the nation. If we had lost it, we would now just be parts of Russia and Sweden. I would be ok with the latter but not the former. So being able to speak thing language that's somewhat unique is an important part of being who I am. The language gives a certain shared mind-space, certain values and assumptions. Losing the language would mean losing all that, not to mention our history. As I said, this language is our soul in very real sense of the word.

&gt; You have to accept the consequences of this is a world of larger cultural empires.

If were born in America, I would only speak English and perhaps know few words of Spanish. Now I speak three and understand on different levels few more. Most people my age do even better. I think we can manage ok.

I agree. I think the hope is that you might be able to move, and just about survive with English, and then learn the actual language to a proper standard intensively after you arrive. Otherwise the migration pattern is going to be very odd, it would be much more common for people to move from smaller countries to large and/or anglophone countries (because those countries would speak a language with more transferable utility).

First but certainly not the last, believe you me. Not to mention that this was made a lot easier by the fact that we are not in the EU. Many European countries are thinking about the same thing.

&gt;It isn't as if China opened a new and anomalously large embassy in Iceland.

&gt;There's surely no evidence to indicate growing interest by the Chinese to operate in and control territory in the arctic and high latitudes due to newly opening sea-routes

They want a presence in the country for precisely the reason you mentioned (and a few others), and they have it.

&gt;And thankfully there's no chance that rich men from China are attempting to buy massive plots of land on Icelandic soil

*One* man, Huang Nubo, wants to buy a huge land but keep in mind that a: we denied the request, b: this caused a media shit storm in Iceland and most politicians were against it, c: what the fuck is he going to do with this land other than build some exotic tourist resort, deploy (government) troops to take over the country? Or establish a naval base? It's 300 km^2 of desolate wasteland of almost no value with no coastline included.

&gt;There's currently no reason to suspect China is investing massive resources in order to encroach on EU territory through economic and demographic means.

Nothing of the sort has happened in Iceland. Huang Nubo is an individual representing a private company to make private profit. They have a huge embassy here in order to try and get some influence on arctic matters. 

&gt;And of course, none of this has happened around the same-time as Iceland making an about face with regards to the EU.

There was *never* a significant majority for the EU in Iceland. To frame it as some sudden change of mind is misleading. Support for the EU reached an all time high in 2005 with 55% of people (a slim majority) wanting to join but has been prominently negative since January of 2009.

&gt;No switching of influence-spheres here, I tell you what.

And even if everything I said up to this point was false it wouldn't really matter. Icelandic politicians along with the Icelandic public are most of which against China. We had a US airbase until 2006 on our land. We are in NATO and NATO fighters patrol our airspace regularly (I think it's Canada's turn now but I'm not sure), we have *very* strong relations with the rest of the Nordics, we are in a whole bunch of European areas and treaties and whatnot, etc. You may read your tabloids, but I'm sorry there is not a chance in hell that Iceland is going to be in ""China's sphere of influence"" anytime soon.

I live in a state most people outside of the US haven't even heard of (Iowa).  You probably can't point to it on a map and I would be extremely surprised if you could name a city within the borders.  This doesn't mean we aren't a community.  It doesn't work like that.  You would still be the same person if you were part of Sweden (or a larger Europe).  You would still have the same neighbors, the same traditions, history, culture, etc.

My state doesn't produce movies, TV shows, music, or anything else that you would let you know about us.  It doesn't mean we don't exist.  We are 3 million strong and are a community.  But at the same time as we surrender a shred of individuality we make great gains from being part of a larger society.  It is an economy of scale.  We are still unique but we have chosen a path of specialization rather than individual nations.  While California and New York make media we make food.  It really works out very well and you give up much less individuality than you'd think.

I'm sorry if I came off a touch harsh but to suggest that you are only part of a community through language is pretty offensive to a person like me who does not share a common language with his community.

From the arc du triumph you can also take the bus to CDG which will take another hour, plus your early arrival time, so youd better leave around noon.  You can ask about the schedule when you leave the orly bus.

This gives you 2 hours to see the Arc De Triomphe, walk down the champs elysees until the river, and see place invalides, walk to eiffel tower.  play with google maps and plan what you can do in those 2 hours.  

The two buses will cost you ~40 euros together.  This is a way to see some stuff, and wont cost all that much, though its tight and only a couple of hours at best.  Work out the timing/walks and try to get the airfrance bus schedule to make sure this will work.

Right-wing states, on the other hand, have passed so-called ""right-to-work"" laws, banning such ""closed shop"" agreements between unions and employers. However, in those states it may even be quite difficult to organise a union in a non-unionized company.

The real problem in the Eurozone is that we don't have enough real governments. As soon as we have real governments that do real decisions then the economic rebound will begin.",0,1371251424,null,0,false,0,caj3t0s,t3_1gchpt,t1_caj3t0s,t1_caixvtr,null,1430806328,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

In all honesty: A US size 18 should be a German size 48-50, which is admittedly very large by European standards. Marburg is not a big city (I actually had to google it), so finding stuff that fits you might be a bit tricky as your choices are pretty limited. 

However, a quick google search told me that there is a H&amp;M in Marburg, so this is probably where you should look. H&amp;M does usually have a plus size section with pretty decent looking clothes, but I'm not positive on how large that particular store's selection will be. 

As for style - don't wear sweatpants as a replacement for actual pants, don't wear flip flops instead of sandals. Jeans and T-Shirt will probably be fine for going to class, maybe pack some cuter stuff for going out at night (even though, again, Marburg is not a metropolis, so I can't tell you how much nightlife there really is.)

H&amp;M does usually have a plus size section with pretty decent looking clothes, but I'm not positive on how large that particular store's selection will be.

I haven't looked for women's clothing there, but, much like Marburg, the store isn't exactly big. The good news is that Frankfurt is only an hour away by train.

&gt;As for style - don't wear sweatpants as a replacement for actual pants, don't wear flip flops instead of sandals. Jeans and T-Shirt will probably be fine for going to class, maybe pack some cuter stuff for going out at night (even though, again, Marburg is not a metropolis, so I can't tell you how much nightlife there really is.)

Agreed on the sweatpants, but I don't see what's wrong with flip flops fashion-wise (personally, I find them impractical and annoying ;)).

Regarding nightlife, Marburg doesn't really have any decent clubs, but plenty of bars and house parties.

true,Debiased,null,null,"This is quite an interesting path if you are completely new to Paris... but I would like to suggest some tweaks:

I'd rather do Orlyval to Antony, then RER B to Denfert-Rochereau, then Metro line 6 to Trocadéro. Count 1h for this trip.

This is because Port-Royal will be quiet at this time in August and will probably not be a great place to catch a cab. Moreover, you will be quicker to reach the Tour Eiffel with the metro line 6 with no extra cost (your RER ticket to Paris will allow you to do that).
Plus, line 6 is partly aerial and the view when you take the bridge over  la Seine will be stunning in the morning (extra tip: sit on the right side of the train for the best view).
And finally, le Trocadéro is one of the best place for a look at the tour Eiffel: it's on top of a (small) hill on the right bank and it will be far better than standing right beneath the Tour Eiffel (anyway you won't have time to climb on it).

You can have a quick snack at Trocadéro.

Then I suggest you walk c.a. 800m to the Champs Elysees. You could aim for the Arc de Triomphe and go down the avenue a little or try to reach it on a shortest path.
When you are tired of the Champs Elysées, take metro line 1 and get off at Palais-Royal. You will emerge right besides the Louvre. Get inside through the Passage Richelieu and you will be in the middle of the court, looking at the glass pyramid. You definitely won't have time to enter the Louvre but it will already be very interesting to do that.

Then walk to Chatelet-les-Halles. You can grab something to eat on your way there (especially in rue Saint Honoré).

And finally, RER B to Charles de Gaulle.
Be careful, there are two RER B stations for Charles de Gaulle, depending of the terminal your plane will be.

Seit 2007 ist Microsoft bei PRISM mit am Start und es gibt viele Studien die der Stadt München raten unbedingt von Linux zu Mircosoft zurückzuwechseln. Wer also so richtig tief in der Scheiße mit drin steckt dürfte 2007 schon dabei gewesen sein und vielleicht sogar beim Ausbau geholfen haben.

Never said nor implied that there wasn't one. But I get the feeling that some people see it as an affront that the ""Crisis countries"" have to pay back there debts and I find that funny, not ha ha funny mind you.

&gt;You and I have a very different idea of ""small"". But granted it was mostly the west but that was because the soviet did not allow east germany to get it.

Let me put that in context, there is no doubt that on a personal level this is a lot of money, I mean a loooot. But you may have heard of the flooding that happened the last weeks in Central Europe, now Germany has just allocated 8 billion € for repairs and help for it's own damaged regions. That is probably not enough to offset the entire damage that was done, but it should take care of most of it. Now that is around 10+ billion $ and all that is just for a few minor cities and villages that are still standing. And now I want you to picture the devastation just after WWII, every major city was bombed into rubble and many of the minor ones, what wasn't destroyed was taken by the Allies, trains and train tracks, machinery, scientists, patents, farm animals ( those that were still alive), etc. .
You got that picture? Now compare it to the damage done by the flood, you see it yet?
As well meant and appreciated as this money was, it was a joke, the proverbial drop of water on a hot stone.

&gt;I never said that. But i'm a little worried we're in that era where your neighbor can starve in the street and nobody gives a fuck, nor even bother to burry the body. The well known ""none of my business"" habit of occident is worrying.

You must be living in an entire different Europe. Besides that, the original commenter implied that it is inmoral for Germany to build an museum while other countries have a crisis and that is just bullshit.
