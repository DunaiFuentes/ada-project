4.5 Wohnversorgung unter strengen Auflagen für Störenfriede

Das Umsiedeln von Tätern ist kein Ziel dieser Masnahme wird aber als letzte Sanktion eingesetzt. Das Umsiedeln darf nicht als Belohnung für ein grenzen- bzw normenüberschreitendes Verhalten gesehen werden. Nach einer Zwangssiedelung ist die Arbeit noch lange nicht vorbei. Firmen, Gemeinden und Sozialpartner handeln in diesem Fall gemeinsam.

Gemeinde, staatle Versorgungseinrichtungen (Arbeitsamt? keine Ahnung) und Firmen entwickeln gemeinsam eine strukturierte und von der Öffentlichkeit getrennte Auffangeinrichtung für umgesiedelte Störenfriede. Amsterdam erkennt an dass Probleme durch Anfeindung (sehr frei übersetzt) schon immer ein strukturelles Problem in der Gesellschaft waren. Daher ist die Stadt auf der Suche nach einer permanenten Unterkunft mit mehreren Wohneinheiten (maximal 10). Das Ziel ist eine neue, staatgetragene Versorgung von Tätern nach dem Vorbild von Deens (Skaeve Huse). Unter Umständen werden 2 verschiedene Einrichtungen hierfür errichtet:   eine Einrichtung für Alleinstehende und eine für extrem ""störende"" und problembehaftete Familien die eine andere Betreuung nötig haben. Konkrete Pläne hierfür werden am 01. April durchgeführt

Außerdem strebt Amsterdam die Einführung von 2 ""Abkühl-Units"" (Wohncontainer, Wohnwagen) an. Das sind kurzfristig verfügbare Unterkünfte für maximal 6 Monate. Der Täter kann so schnell umgesiedelt werden um die Nachbarschaft schnell zu beruhigen.

Here are the facts I know:

* Florence had a long relationship with her boyfriend the abductor and lived in the same house where the abducted were held. 
* The whole arrest of Florence and her boyfriend was illegal.
* Even though the arrest was illegal she was trialed and found guilty based in part on the accounts of victims.
* There are victims who to this day still identify her as one of their captors and torturers.
* The reason she's been let go is mainly because of the conditions of her arrest. The minsters did add some considerations about the victims changing their statements during the trial

My personal opinion is that although it is possible that she was completely innocent, it is very unlikely, she had to at least be aware of what was going on. 

Yesterday one of the victims made very bitter statements against her liberation [(video in spanish)](http://youtu.be/MxglMyAO6Ew). This man currently lives in the United States and has nothing to gain from making such declarations. I believe his word alone at this circumstances is enough to doubt the innocence of Florence.

I think it is interesting that you are trying to tell me what arguments I get to use... (Seeing how you put words into my mouth, and refraining from using facts, but prefer to omit the truth, I get the feeling you don't know how a real discussion works.)
I believe your argument is stupid, but as you picked this argument, I decided to do some fact checking for you:
ARD: 16:00-16:10 Tagesschau, 17:00-17:15 Tagesschau, 19:40-19:47 (let's assume you're right about the 7 minutes) = 32 min news between (16-22:00), and as you know, on a normal day it would be more.

ZDF: 70 min news between:16-22:15

and guess what...There even is the station tagesschau24 which broadcasts the Tagesschau every 15 minutes from 9-20:00 every day for you. That's 660 minutes for you. I hope that is not too wedged in for you.

Besides that you can watch it on the web 24/7.

So I think they are doing a pretty good job on keeping the public informed.

&gt;You're so full of yourself that you don't even acknowledge that the opposing viewpoint actually exists, so what would be the point.

I also think that they are wasting money in so many places. Reporting on stars? Volksmusik? Cooking shows? Soaps? Sporting events? That is all not for me. But you know, as I am not so full of myself, I can acknowledge that there are other people with different interests than me. And they probably like to see it. Maybe some people are too old and sick to move out of their house, don't have a family that cares for them. And maybe the only thing that is of interest to them and makes them happy is Volksmusik and cooking shows. You know, I am very happy to support that with my payment. Who am I to judge what the others get to see? (I try not to get up on that high horse, even though I often shake my head and can't understand how friends of mine like to watch shows like Bauer sucht Frau or Junglecamp.) So overall, I get the feeling that you have difficulties acknowledging the opposing viewpoint.

On the other hand, the ÖR have programming that appeals to me, but doesn't appeal to most other people. I guess it balances out in most cases. I have a hard time believing that you don't get anything out of any of their services (web/radio/TV/local TV). And if that would be the case, I absolutely believe that you belong to a very small minority. And how could you prove that you don't use any of their services? I guess that's pretty much impossible without installing spying infrastructure on every device you use. So, I guess you're out of luck and you'll have to contribute to the system as well. Maybe over time, you'll learn to appreciate their services as well.

However there are some specific aspects which are totally fucked up; e.g. paying Monica Lierhaus 450.000€ a year just to read the lottery numbers.. They should do something about that. So please don't get me wrong. The programming and execution is far from perfect.

- Twenty-eight percent hope for the U.K. one day to become a fundamentalist Islamic state

- This comports with last year's Daily Telegraph newspaper survey that found one-third of British Muslims believe that Western society is decadent and immoral and that **Muslims should seek to end it.**

- Sixty-eight percent support the arrest and prosecution of those British people who ""insult Islam.""

- the NOP Research survey reports, ""hardcore Islamists"" constitute nine percent of the British Muslim population. A slightly more moderate group is composed of ""staunch defenders of Islam.""

I don't know where you get the impression that I have the impression that you should deal with me feeling uncomfortable. I knew what I was potentially getting into when opening myself up to a new culture and I chose not to turn down her conversation. I went with it and talked to her about it and did what little I could to maybe help make her feel better. I certainly never once expected her to do anything differently because of me, *especially* in a situation where she simply didn't know. The only reason I even brought up this ""incident"" is because it fits with the cultural difference issue and you claiming there is something ""wrong"" with those of us who are fine with sharing a dorm room.

This making wild accusations and putting words into my mouth is making *me* a bit uncomfortable.

I'm going to completely ignore your condescension and give you serious answers. While there are co-ed dorm rooms, there are also same-sex dorms, and even singles. It's not as though you have no choice. Every person is different and the choice should be left up to each individual.

It's not a non-issue and it is comparable. You said it's a cultural difference when someone brings up money 5 minutes after meeting them. Where I'm from, income is considered personal so to us it's not much different than someone telling us about relationship problems 5 minutes after meeting them.

&gt; Yes? As I have said quite a few times.

So you're saying allowing an 18 year old to make up their own mind about what would make *them* feel comfortable is wrong and treating them like a child? Got it.

&gt; Funny how there are suddenly people who want to share a room. A little earlier it was for economic reasons, which would make at least a little bit of sense. By the way you can find friends easily without sleeping in the same room (flatmates?).

Why can't it be for both? It *is* more economical, especially when it comes to colleges located in areas where the cost of living is high, but you still have the option to choose what kind of living arrangements you want. Everyone is different (I know you don't like me saying this, but it's the simple truth here), even when it comes to how they make friends. Some people have zero problem going up to complete strangers, and some people aren't comfortable with that. They might prefer to have a roommate they can get to know then make friends through the roommate. And some people simply don't care whether they get a single or a shared room.

&gt; You could also make it an option to sleep in a tent, and there probably would be a few poor fellas who would do it. Doesn't make it right in my opinion.

Now you're grasping at straws. A person living in a tent isn't comparable to two people sharing a warm, safe room.

&gt; You could try this: make shared and single rooms the same price and look what people will prefer. Then ask yourself why that is.

Offering only single rooms means fewer dorms. Fewer dorms means less options for the students. It would be terrible for a person to not be able to attend the college they want to go to because there isn't a free dorm and they can't afford a place off campus or the area doesn't have public transportation to get them there (many places here have very little, if any, public transportation).

In a perfect world there would be plenty of everything for everyone, but the world simply isn't perfect and by offering shared dorms, the colleges are doing the best they can with the space they have.

But I digress... the simple fact is you're being highly judgmental to say there is something wrong with a person who *chooses* to share a room with someone for, apparently, any reason.",0,1359054007,null,0,1359054390,0,c82vfol,t3_1732xu,t1_c82vfol,t1_c82uzor,null,1431066694,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

That shared dorms are not just economical, but some people actually don't mind or might even want to share a room with someone? Or that not enough dorms could actually cause people to not be able to attend the college they want to go to? I honestly have understood everything you've been saying, until now. I'm not clear on what it is you *knew*.

I'm not saying there is anything wrong with your personal view on shared dorms, what I'm saying is that there *is* something wrong with passing judgment on people who don't agree with your view. What if the tables were turned and I was the one who posted something like, ""If someone thinks it's okay to allow their 7 year old child to walk to school alone, there's something wrong with them.""? Chances are pretty decent I'd be labeled as a dumb American who is ignorant of other cultures (because it's just not something the average American allows. Unless they live right near the school, the average parent isn't having their small child walk to school. If they don't take the school bus, a parent drives them).

I agree that it would be a very ignorant statement to make, so why is it okay for you to make the same type of judgment of people who choose to do something that isn't harming anyone? And no, I don't believe that two 18 year old girls or two 18 year old boys who share a room will be harmed in any way, shape, or form because of puberty. For most people it's already winding down by the age of 18. It's not necessarily over, but it isn't quite the same as being 14, 15, or 16. If sharing a room during the school year for a few years causes a person such strife, that particular individual has underlying issues that need to be addressed. It's not an issue of puberty and the majority of students will remain completely healthy people after sharing a dorm while in college. You may not agree with this practice, but there's nothing wrong with those who do.

I'd say there's a much bigger argument of a small child walking to school ended up harmed than there is of sharing a dorm harming anyone, but you know what? Sending your child off to walk to school is normal practice in other countries. That's what the children expect to do and they're prepared for it. Here, sharing dorms is normal practice and people prepare for it.

The Albanian authorities claim that the Czech power company owes the government over US$1bn in damages owing to a failure to import sufficient electricity for the Balkan country and not investing in the electricity grid. CEZ denies all allegations. Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas has criticised the move and called it a 'negative signal' for the Albanian business environment. CEZ, which is majority owned by the Czech government has tried to extricate itself from the loss-making market for a number of months. We anticipate frosty relations between the governments of the Czech Republic and Albania to persist over this matter, likely even beyond its resolution.

You can go skiing in the Black Forest. There's public transportation and everything and it's pretty popular. The suisse Alps aren't too far either. Switzerland is expensive but if you're really good at skiing and into it, you have to do it. Personally, I find the Black Forest a little underwhelming.

They're great because you just sleep during your travel time. It's possible to arrive in your destination early on Friday or Saturday and leave late on Sunday, giving you a full two or three days at your destination. If you get a BahnCard (which gives you a discount of 25% or 50% on train fares, and you can rack up points) and you book early enough, you can get really good deals. Other destinations like London or Rome can be reached very cheaply by using the bargain airlines like Ryanair. 

I had a great time visiting cities like London, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Munich, and Prague, but don't forsake all the great stuff in and around Freiburg. Strasbourg, Colmar, Karlsruhe, Heidelberg, and lots of other cities are only an hour or two away by train. And there's plenty of stuff immediately surrounding Freiburg that's even closer by regional train. This stuff can be incredibly fun and exciting. One thing I did a couple times, for example, was to walk to St. Ottilien, which is just a few miles from the city center in Freiburg. Or you can make a day of using your SemesterTicket to use the Höllentalbahn, which is a beautiful scenic train route from Freiburg into the Black Forest. 

If you have a short time in Europe, it's obviously great to visit the big cities. It's much cheaper to travel within Europe than to have to take a transatlantic flight. However, I would advise against getting too caught up in it. A lot of people seem to want to *have seen* things like the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben or the Colosseum, but when it really comes down to it, that might not be the best use of your time.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7723808.stm

&gt; The European Commission has scrapped controversial rules that prevent oddly-sized or misshapen fruit and vegetables being sold in Europe.

&gt; **The EU's agriculture commissioner called it ""a new dawn for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot"".**

&gt; Marketing standards for 26 types of produce were scrapped, in a drive to cut bureaucracy.

&gt; The rules were introduced to ensure common EU standards, but are regarded by critics as examples of Euro-madness.

&gt; **Some 20% of produce is rejected by shops across the EU because it fails to meet the current requirements.**

The rules were repealed, as the article says, in 2008, and since then I've also noticed that supermarkets have started selling specific ranges of fruit and vegetables that are non-standard shapes, and with mottled surfaces, for a cut-down price. Like [this](http://dsmnative.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/142561.jpg) and [this](http://images.mysupermarket.co.uk/Products_1000/78/116978.jpg).

I don't know whether the regulations were already in place before the European rules came in, but regardless, they were silly, and having European rules prevented reforms at a national level. But credit for the EU for actually reforming it:

&gt;At a news conference at the Elysee Palace in Paris, attended by more than 1,000 diplomats, civil servants and ministers as well as journalists, General de Gaulle accused Britain of a ""deep-seated hostility"" towards European construction.  

.
&gt;He said France would back commercial exchanges with Britain - ""be it called association or by any other name"" - but that was all. 

I find it surprising that after having thrown so much at de Gaulle for basically saying ""you do not want what we want with the EEC"" the UK seems to be proving him right.

And yes, the EEC always was a political project, never just an economic zone. Its very preamble of the treaty creating it speaks of ""an ever closer union between the people of Europe"", ""ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide Europe"", ""guarantee steady expansion""...it was pretty obvious that it was the start of a closer political union.",0,1359064296,null,0,false,0,c82zakq,t3_176l7j,t1_c82zakq,t3_176l7j,null,1431068597,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,baycitytroller,SCOT,Scotland,"Interestingly there is no link to the data so we have to take Simon Johnson's word for it. Perhaps the data might show a more nuanced picture? Perhaps there might be other bits of information that Mr Johnson hasn't deemed worthy of sharing?

Well [here](http://www.scotcen.org.uk/media/1021487/ssa12tables.pdf) are the question cards for 1999 to 2012 (pdf alert).

The first problem for Mr Johnson is that the referendum will be a straight yes/no instead of being faced with the five options that are on card 1. The huge 50% for ""Scotland should remain part of the UK, with its own elected parliament which has some taxation powers"" encompasses those in favour of the status quo and the devo-maxers. Now those that favoured devo-max have had that option denied them (by agent Cameron). It is a huge, and I would say cavalier, assumption to include this group in the 72% against - as Mr Johnson does.

When you ask slightly different questions you get a different picture.

When asked which institution ought to make the important decisions for Scotland about welfare, the answers were; Holyrood 64%, Westminster 19%. For taxation the answer was 56% Holyrood and 36% Westminster. [card 3]

When asked which institution has the most influence on the way Scotland is run the response was; Holyrood 34%, Westminster 41%, Local Councils 10%, the EU 6%. When asked which institution **should** have the most influence on the way Scotland is run the response was; Holyrood 63%, Westminster 24%, Local Councils 8%, the EU 1%. [cards 5 &amp; 6]

When asked who should make government decision for Scotland the answers was (i've summarised the headings); The Scottish Parliament 35%, devo-max 32%, Status Quo 24%, Westminster (devolution scrapped) 6%. [card 4]

So essentially the survey shows Scots to be in favour of independence as long as its not called independence. Of course devo-max is not on the table, so we have ""Yes"" on 35% and ""No"" on 30% (24 + 6) with the 32% devo-maxers out there to be won over to either side.

Wouldn't increasing wages across the board negate cutting the hours? If you have an employment issue, wouldn't it be better to slash hours, maintain current wages, and use that saved money to hire new workers?

""There is no new up and coming industry that is magically going to provide labour to the masses.""

There probably is no single industry, but there are probably a few that taken together would put a sizable dent in the unemployment figures. For instance, there is another article that was recently posted to /r/europe a few hours ago that nobody commented on, which is a shame. Europe seems to be steadfastly against the idea of fracking, however that is misguided. 

Read these two articles from the economist: The [first](http://www.economist.com/node/21558459) article deals with the natural boom in America, the [second](http://www.economist.com/node/21558458) deals with why Europe has ignored a promising, transformative industry. Why is Europe turning away from an entire industry when they desperately need the jobs, the money, and the energy? In addition, large swathes of Europe won't have to kiss Putin's ass to heat their homes during the winter. Furthermore, reducing energy costs reduces production costs which should make exports even cheaper. The benefits to fracking are numerous, yet Europe looks away. Something unrelated but also amusing: America didn't sign on to the Kyoto Protocols. However, it is the only nation in the world that looks likely to meet the reduction in levels in green house gases set forth by the kyoto protocol. Not only will it exceed the the levels in reduction, but it will do so five years ahead of schedule...almost entirely due to fracking.

I wish I new more about the nuances of Europe's labor market, its industries, and regulations. However I think that if Europe were to begin reforming its approach to those three things, it might be surprised to find that there were jobs all along right under its nose, and all it took was some clarity and some guts to leverage its resources it has been neglecting. Europe shouldn't have to worry about competition from Africa and Asia, Africa and Asia should have to worry about competing with Europe.

Take [the map of the far right vote](http://static.ladepeche.fr/content/photo/biz/2012/04/23/photo_1335187149654-1-0_zoom.jpg), and the [map of immigrant population](http://vivianericard.unblog.fr/2010/10/04/files/2010/10/carte.jpg).

As for your comment about the collapse in the quality of life in America that leads to us to actually get jobs, that is a gross exaggeration. Do you, or have you worked in the manufacturing industry in America? I do. And there are many workers who make quite a bit of money. They are hardly dissillusioned peons showing up to work everyday hoping to earn enough to afford bread.

""...but it's just more energy for making the wheels turn, when in fact, we should be asking if the wheels have to turn so much at all""

The wheel do have to turn this much. Never before in human history have so many people moved from the depths of destitution to a relatively decent life. They need goods too, and there are now billions of them. That means factories have be operating all day and all night to meet the demands of 3 billion or so more people that want the same shit you and I have. Somebody has got to supply them, why can't Europe get in on the act (and on that note, they are, but it could be more, much more).

The reality is is that other countries are catching up, and are doing the stuff we used to do for much cheaper. We can't actually asks the Chineese, Africans, and Indians to stop working so much because we can't keep up and maintain our precious vacation time. That means we must innovate to become competitive.

Supermarkets don't even accept delivery of those, because they've learned they will just be left to rot in the end.  
Or take strawberries. They don't taste like they used to, do they? That's because strands are chosen for appearance, robustness against pressure and time, not for how they taste.

Of course it's stupid that a large share of fruit and vegetables (up to [30% in the UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20968076)) are rejected based on physical appearance alone, but if consumers don't buy it, there's no point in putting it on the shelf.

From this perspective, this regulation makes sense. A buyer for a supermarket chain needs to compare offers from growers in various countries. This classification system makes them comparable.

This is impossible. We are too different. One culture will come out on top and all others will feel oppressed and have an identity crisis.

Can you just be honest? Please? This is about the war, isn't it? This all about catharsis and nothing else.

The age of the supranational institution is over, mate. When was the last time anyone cared about anything the UN said? They recently said that access to clean water should be a human right and everyone said no. No one gives a damn what they say, and--after France--it is the butt end of all bureaucracy jokes.

When was the last time NATO got involved in a war? What happened in Libya? Was it a supranational organisation or was it a [*edit*: network] of autonomous states who helped each other out to quickly and effectively get a job done?

This isn't the 1950s. We don't need some Treaty of Rome-esue combined foreign policy. When the EU was formed in 1992 it was formed in a world where the internet wasn't even understood properly. This is a world of networks. Of Google and Twitter and Facebook. Young people think in networks now. What is the point of insisting that we're going to be a bloc when, in 20 years time, the world is going to be led by people who (currently in their 20s and 30s) are natural networkers? The giant Super State bloc will become a stumbling block to a generation which don't think in bloc-terms, while the rest of the world speeds ahead flexibly and independently but still completely capable of enjoying peace and brotherhood with each other. The EU has to change. It's already outdated, and in 20 years time it is going to be cumbersome beyond belief.

Keep the single market, remain close allies, but drop this insistence of a super state. It can only fail once it reaches the hands of a generation who don't know what to do with it.

As much as I agree that all religions are equally intolerant if you read the texts, most muslims tend to still interpret it strictly, like christians maybe used to do 400 years ago (save some new baptist lunatics in the US)

To stay on the topic of France, France is historically a christian / catholic country, so we are used to them being here, to have churches around and to be honnest, most of french youth is atheist.

The problem is that with an influx of 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants, searching for an identity, religion is really appealing.

I am sad when I go back home in France (Lille) and walk past Quick (fast food chain) halal restaurants. I sincerely am.

I live in Ireland and I am shocked when a Pakistanese colleague leaves work 3 hr early because it's ramadan and he feels weak.

Look at the war in Mali, in the many reports of Sharia law being enforced around the world... the woman that beat her son to death last week cause he was unable to remember sentences from the Coran.

In Europe, Christianity faced those issues hundreds of years ago and had to either adapt or become a relic of the past ( which does seem unavoidable anyway, it's just slowing the process down).
Most muslims do not want to adapt, and want to impose their religion on everyone, look up Stealth Jihad or their best prophet, Mr Tariq Ramadan.

&gt; Vallianatos and Others v. Greece (relinquishment) - 29381/09
 
&gt; Article 8

&gt; Article 8-1

&gt; Respect for private life

&gt; Homosexual couples denied access to registered partnership status: relinquishment in favour of the Grand Chamber
 
&gt; Article 14

&gt; Discrimination

&gt; Homosexual couples denied access to registered partnership status: relinquishment in favour of the Grand Chamber
 
&gt; The applications concerned Law no. 3719/2008 entitled “Reforms concerning Families, Children, Society and other provisions”, which introduced in parallel to marriage an official form of cohabitation, the “registered partnership”. Under the first section of that Law, such partnerships are reserved for opposite-sex adults. The applicants, apart from the association “Synthessi”, are in homosexual relationships and complain under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention of a difference in treatment on grounds of sex.

The Court heard the case last week ([webcast in English](http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Press/Multimedia/Webcasts+of+public+hearings/webcastEN_media?id=20130116-1&amp;lang=en&amp;flow=high)). The couples will definitely win this, and the case will serve as a precedent.

Poland, pay attention.

In the UK, no one has even had the common courtesy to *ask us* if we were *for* this form of integration. We were asked in the 1970s if we wanted to be a member of the EEC, and we voted ""Yes"", but there was no vote on the EU, no vote on further integration, and no vote on whether we wanted to be a part of what the EU will become. 

Many here are violently opposed to being a future member of a federal state, and shouting them down and calling them names is only going to make it look like the debate is being stifled. Like people are being deliberately shut up for holding a particular view. Arguments *for* inevitable Federalisation sound very much like threats, and that has not gone down well at all. Nor has the repeated assertion that there is no alternative than the path that has been laid out before us, that *we have no choice*. There is always a choice. 

So I welcome a serious and open discussion about where we want the EU to go. And once that has been fully decided, amongst the EUs constituent nations, each nation can then make up its mind about whether it wants to be a part of that or not.

Et à aucun moment je ne sens d'intolérance ou de prozélytisme quand je bosse avec des musulmans ou quand je me promène dans mon quartier (où la population n'est pas vraiment blanche).

Le problème c'est que ces musulmans ""normaux"" n'ont aucune visibilité dans les medias. Non, tout ce à quoi on a droit c'est du journalisme qui veut choquer et nous montre les extrêmistes.

I think this goes a long way for explaining why black-faced children pretending to be one of the three wise men is not considered offensive here.

Also, we have to look at literature in its historical context, like the article mentions. Much more appropriate than censoring books, I think it would be better to include this kind antiquated language as a way to understand how people thought back then.

Once again, I'm not an economist, so I'm trying to give my point of view. I'm asking all this questions because i would like someone who can teach me more.  

Anyways, I do have some questions for you:  

&gt; What has hourly salary got to do with unnecessary regulatory compliance?  

We agree here, unnecessary regulatory compliance is bad!  

&gt; We are able to have higher salary that the average guy in Bangladesh because we have a higher productivity.  

I find this hard to believe. How can you prove that a typical worker in Bangladesh has a lot less productivity than us here in the UK??  

&gt; Unnecessary regulations and bureaucracy and wasted money going to corruption and useless EU projects undermine production   

I don't think it undermines production! I think it undermines the EU itself - I'm referring to corruption (Greece, Portugal??). I don't see how bureaucracy can cause our salary levels to be higher or lower...  

&gt; and depress our salaries towards Bangladesh levels.  

And I thought that regulations actually kept our salaries higher?? There are countries which are currently abolishing work laws (Spain) in order to make sacking someone a lot easier! While they expect this to improve the rate at which companies hire, I'm sure that once that companies will use it to keep salaries 'more competitive' (aka lower)!

Il n'empêche, cette hystérie autour du mariage gay, où il est question, en vrac et pas forcément dans l'ordre, de pédophilie, de polygamie, de zoophilie, d'inceste... me pousse à m'interroger sur la santé mentale des personnes proférant de telles inepties. Quant à ceux qui ne vont pas aussi loin, mais utilisent des arguments religieux pour justifier leur opposition à ce type d'union, nos opinions sont profondément inconciliables. S'appuyer sur une illusion pour justifier le fait de ne pas accorder un droit à des personnes qui en sont dépourvues me dépasse. 

Ceci dit, loin de moi l'idée d'ostraciser un quelconque adversaire. J'ai lu -mais trop peu hélas- des arguments intelligents contre le mariage gay, offrant une réflexion sur ce qu'est la famille, le but du mariage, la place des enfants, l'adoption etc. qui m'ont incités à réfléchir en allant au-delà du bruit et de la fureur des manifestations des ""pros"" et des ""antis"". D'une manière générale, je me méfie de ceux qui en font ""trop"" dans un sens où dans l'autre, ils finissent toujours par décridibiliser la cause pour laquelle ils agissent, et c'est un peu ce qui est en train d'arriver aux activistes anti mariage gay : les ""ultras"", les cathos intégristes, les fachos etc. ont fait trop de bruit, les autres sont assimilés à eux. Comme tu le sous-entend [ici](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/171lvd/je_ne_suis_pas_homophobe_mais/c82v11c), on a vite fait de faire l'amalgame entre les antis ""raisonnables"" et les antis... comme dire ? j'ai envie de dire ""névrosés"", tant leur obsession et leur acharnement a quelque chose de malsain et d'inquiétant. 

Ceci dit, j'en suis sincèrement désolé, j'aurais aimé un débat apaisé et équilibré... démocratique j'ai envie de dire. Au lieu de ça, nous avons un affrontement. Mais qui a ouvert les hostilités ? (je ne dis pas ça pour toi)

En ce qui me concerne, je suis toujours ouvert à la discussion, et toujours prêt à changer d'opinion (quel que soit le sujet) pour peu que l'on me donne des arguments qui tiennent la route, qui soient concrets et dépassionnés. Mais réduire l'argumentaire à ""hétérosexualité = normal = bien"" et ""homosexualité = pas dans la norme = pas bien"" n'est pas de nature à me convaincre. 

Encore un mot, à propos de ta citation de Renaud Camus ; c'est de bonne guerre :)  Les pros mariage vont trouver des gens de droite et/ou catho pour le mariage gay, les antis vont trouver des homos qui s'y opposent ! C'est une illustration, un contre-exemple poil-à-gratter, pas une démonstration. Si Renaud Camus est contre, alors l'ensemble des homos de France doit s'aligner sur son opinion ? Les gays doivent garder leur ""spécificité"", leur ""folklore"", pur ne pas s'aligner sur la norme hétéro ?

This is a pretty bad comparison, honestly. Science textbooks have to be updated because they reflect current knowledge. Literature should not be updated because they reflect the values of the period in which they were written. There is a huge difference there, I think!

Si les catholiques d'aujourd'hui peuvent s'affirmer ""tolérant"", c'est qu'ils pratiquent une religion ""à la carte"", en s'affranchissant des obligations et des interdits les plus lourds, en s'arrangeant avec le dogme et la doctrine.

Ce que je veux dire c'est que par essence, toute religion est intolérante, et les trois monosthéismes le sont plus que toute autre, car ils ne tolèrent pas la contradiction, de par leur côté ""révélé"" ; ils ne tolèrent pas une autre vision du monde, et visent même à étendre la leur à l'ensemble de la planète (un bon point pour le judaïsme qui s'est cantonné à une région semi-désertique, chapeau) : croisades, Jihad, colonialisme, terrorisme... qu'avons-nous fait sinon nous renvoyer la balle depuis des siècles ?

Like this guy who moved country and lost all his games on his xbox.

Reducing social cohesion, really?  Can you not see how you've managed to flip the argument almost completely backwards?  You've claimed that preventing certain members of society from legally binding themselves to each other (so, marginalizing yet another group from the only ""real"" citizens) actually strengthens the idea of solidarity and the unity of the society?  Do you not understand how absolutely entirely misguided such a sentiment is?

Breaking society into smaller groups some of which we will punish for their sexuality is supposed to create a stronger society?  You don't think THAT will alienate people and lead people to be indifferent towards each other?  Just so curious why you've chosen homosexuality as the defining characteristic of a ""deviant"" group.  There are heterosexuals that become aroused by interracial pornography, humiliation, scatological play, latex, pain and bondage, midget porn, muscular women, anorexic sex, drinking piss, religious symbolism, or simply obese nudity; yet you've decided to single out homosexuals as the most deviant???  Society can encourage women to shave their pubic hair to appear pre-pubescent and even this isn't frowned upon.

I've gone to school with homosexuals.  I've seen homosexuals come to terms with their maturing definition of sexuality, I've worked together with homosexuals.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; The question is, should we be so concerned about hitting 100%?

Yes we should. Those periods in history where we were above 100% were typically major wars or when w ehad the ability to effectively pillage the Empire. We are not at war to the same level and neither do we have the luxury of exploiting an empire. 

The problem with stimulii packages is that they really need to generate value for the long term. In some cases this happens but there are plenty of white elephants and roads to nowhere (in the UK, Europe and US) that over the long term were ineffective. 

The ratio debt to GDP is only a guide, in reality it is the difference between government spending and government tax take that is important and for far too long the government have been spending too freely (structural deficit). At the end of the day will the economic growth generated by spending increase the tax take sufficiently to cover costs and interest? 

I'd say no, since even during a boom with the banks on full crazy and the tax receipts a lot higher the government was unable to pay its bills and was borrowing (thanks Brown). So yes, we need austerity because we cannot sustain these levels of spending, and bear in mind we're not even trying to reduce the debt to GDP ratio simply reduce the rate at which we borrow.

By all means we should seek to invest to minimise the pain of what we're donig but the leftist fantasy of spending our way out of every problem is well and truly over. Keynsian economics works if you follow it - i.e. save during booms and spend during recessions, Labour didn't.

The US has had major issues, with talks of a fiscal cliff and there are many that are unhappy with the US debt rising so highly. The only thing in the US's favour right now is that they are the main global currency for trade. 

Japan has major debt issues and has spent nearly 2 decades stagnating.

&gt;A lot of books are available for free in epub format, if you have a kindle you have to convert them first.
&gt;I don't know how it works with Kindle, but with kobo you just have to plug the reader on your computer, drop the epub files on it like an external drive, and unplug the reader, and you can read the books.

Yeah, where sync is not appropriate you can do this with kindle, and management software like calibre does the conversion. Most publishers provide multiple formats though, eg with Manning I just download a .mobi, email it to myself and it's synced with my device - no lock-in and no hassle.

&gt;And i'm afraid if you buy a french kindle you could have to only use amazon.fr and not amazon.com.

N'empêche qu'au moment où l'on parle, les catholique défilent pacifiquement avec des panneaux pendants que des milices islamiques bombardent avec des obus ou tabassent des gens qui ne portent pas le vêtement qu'il faut.

Donc, *factuellement*, au moment où nous écrivons, et probablement pour encore 15-20 ans au moins -- et évidemment pour des raisons historiques, et à cause du comportement des pays occidentaux -- l'islam est nettement plus agressive et violente que le catholicisme ou le judaïsme.

Pour ce qui est de l'obligation de se marier pour avoir deux parents, je ne vois pas où est le problème, c'est déjà le cas pour les couples hétérosexuels.

Sinon, il doit effectuer une démarche positive, la reconnaissance (art. 316 [du Code Civil]).""

Quant à la liaison faite entre mariage et adoption, c'est l'argument massue des opposants aux mariage gay. Que je sache, on ne se marie pas (plus) pour faire des enfants. Aux yeux de la loi, on se marie pour bénéficier d'un statut particulier aux yeux de la société... et protecteur (décès, séparation, impôts, donation au dernier vivant... les couples mariés ont des avantages).

  Czechs are the opposite. They are outwardly cold and go about their business.  They don't give a shit what you're doing as long as you're not in their way.  They don't care about the latest and greatest thing (car, IPhone, job, little pizza joint that puts pine nuts and gellato on their pizza), it just doesn't matter to them.  I personally liked this since it was more like the people of my hometown.  All of the Californians that I know that lived in CZ couldn't stand the people. 

Istanbul on the other hand is perfect for californians.  There's tons of bars an cafes not to mention ethnic music (albeit fucking terrible ethnic music).  The people are very similar to the West coast of the US (outwardly friendly in that totally fake way).

&gt;d'où tiens tu que la volonté de se marier ne concerne qu'une minorité

Hypothèse : les couples se marient peu (du coup cela ne concerne que les couples hétéros)  
Propriété :  les couples homos sont comme les couples hétéros  
Conclusion : les couples homos se marient peu  

En fait, mon hypothèse est probablement vraie chez les athées, et fausse chez les croyants (71% de la population). Il y a également une question de générations (jeunes / vieux).

Cela dit, j'ai du mal à avoir des données : [deux fois plus de PACS que de mariages](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=T10F032). Mais beaucoup de pacsés se marient ensuite, mais les stats sur le mariage sont pourries par les divorces. En gros, la tendance générale est à la baisse du mariage chez les hétéros, donc pareil pour les homos.

&gt;Corollaire : si tu es si sûr que seule une minorité d'homosexuels veut se marier, pourquoi est-ce que ça vous dérange ? A t'entendre, ils auront un droit qu'ils n'utiliseront pas, donc où est le problème ?

Le premier problème, c'est qu'en temps général, on ne discute pas, on m'insulte. 

Le deuxième problème, c'est qu'au lieu de faire une vraie réforme de société, on colle une rustine pourrie sans poser les questions intéressantes. Le texte est mal rédigé, ne résout pas la reconnaissance de l'enfant par le beau-parent non marié (quel que soit son sexe), et ne parle pas de la PMA. Ce texte est mauvais, donc je suis contre (au passage, on ferait mieux de s'occuper d'autre chose).

Le seul truc que j'aime bien, c'est qu'il y a de fortes chances que le nombre d'adoptions d'enfants étrangers baisse. Je trouve ça bien, car l'adoption d'enfants étrangers s'apparente à un achat d'enfant de pays pauvre par une famille riche.

Le sens de l'histoire c'est de reconnaître les enfants ayant plusieurs parents du même sexe. Le tout est de le faire intelligemment, et je ne comprends pas pourquoi on le fait à travers cette connerie qu'est le mariage.

Can you name one country that *has* run into problems with interest on debt denominated in the free floating currency it issues? Because I can think of not one.

&gt; Britain wouldn't enjoy meagre 3% on its bonds if it had 100+% debt-to-GDP ratio, like the US does right now.

If you're lending to the entity that issues the currency, and assuming they'd sooner print than default, the **only** risk is inflation, correct? Now realise that this same risk applies no matter who you lend to - or even if you lend to no one - but everyone else has an *additional* risk of default, and you have to realise that the government is therefore guaranteed amongst the lowest interest lending in that currency. Now realise that the government sector (through the central bank) sets the rate at which banks lend to one another via open market operations, buying and selling government securities, and you have to accept that it is more or less setting its own interest rate.

Another way of looking at this: why would banks lend to one another at 0% interest when they could buy bonds returning 5% interest? They wouldn't, of course. So funds would be withdrawn from the interbank lending markets in favour of bonds, the funds rate would exceed the target by the central bank and *how does the central bank correct this*? By buying assets off the banks, principally bonds, until banks are happy lending to each other at the target rate. This won't happen until bonds are returning low yields, which once again shows that government bonds are more-or-less set by the central bank.

So no, the US isn't (overly) different, at least not regards to debt. The UK government currently has low interest lending because its debt is denominated in the currency it issues and the central bank is targeting zero interest rates. Japan is the same. Singapore is the same. Etc.

Moi. Laisse moi répondre à ton commentaire, car je le trouve vachement bien écrit. 

&gt; Qui croit sérieusement que tous les hommes vivant sur terre sont les descendant d'un couple originel ?

Le dogme Catholique prend la Genèse avec un grain de sable. Il croit en le péché originel, mais croit aussi que l'histoire d'Adam et Eve est une métaphore. Dont combien de Catholiques sont créationistes ? Pas beaucoup, mais certainement pas le Pape. 

Ensuite, le problème que j'ai avec cet article, c'est que le mot 'tolérant' ne veut rien dire. Je suis ce que tu appellerais un extrémiste : Je suis contre la contraception, l'avortement, le mariage gay. Cela dit, je n'ai aucun mal à trainer avec des homosexuels, couples non mariés, femmes ayant avorté, et à moins d'avoir une discussion sérieuse sur la religion, je n'insulterais pas leur façon de vivre.

Donc comment qualifie-t-on 'intolérant' ? Car la loi en elle-même est intolérante. Elle ne tolère pas que tu tues quelqu'un parce que tu en as envie. Si l'on compte 'intolérant' comme 'restrictif', alors oui, à la base de toute religion, il y a de l'intolérance.

Encore une fois, je ne suis pas d'accord. Comme tu l'as dit, tout est question d'époque, car même si l'Eglise a eu une histoire violente par moments, elle en est aujourd'hui sortie. Si les religions n'acceptent pas la contradiction, comment se fait-il que les leaders religieux des trois grandes monothéistes se rencontrent souvent ?

Tu dis ça comme si c'était une mauvaise chose. Car en tant que Catholique, nous croyons que notre vision est la bonne, et la seule vraie. Normal de vouloir l'étendre.

So what, we do what they do, spend 20 years focussing on reducing debt with an economy which in net terms is going nowhere? We need to do *something* more adventurous than that.

I mean really, you act as if I said ""hurr durr the US did it EU is the same so it'll be the same hurr durr"" - I didn't. I made a specific comparison about ONE similarity, which can already be seen.

Quite annoyed you had a go at that tbh, it's either rude or simplistic.

&gt;But why?? We don't need it at all. If we can handle day-to-day domestic affairs why do we have to hand over day-to-day foreign affairs to some other institution?

In international terms, power. We lack it, by pooling together, we get more. Also the efficiency of having a single foreign policy, single military, and so forth. Very much a case of ""why not?"" as well. I mean currently foreign affairs are run from somewhere about 600 miles from me, why do I care about another 150 miles?

Lack of a strong executive right now hampers it, but an executive needs power to be functional and so far the EU is far more capable as a legislative and investigative body in the politcal sense because countries are far more willing to cede the more ""boring"" responsibilities to the EU, while maintaining individual control over things like financial policy, foreign policy, defence, etc. Perfectly understandable, but you can't tie a mans hands behind his back and then complain when he takes longer to run a race.",0,1359129545,null,0,false,0,c83ea2q,t3_178223,t1_c83ea2q,t1_c83dr4r,null,1431075839,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The Basque don't stand a chance of their own chunk of France, Belgium may *split* but that's entirely different, I assume you refer to Åland when you mention Finland, but they're good where they are.

The UK job market is improving, only this month we saw a decrease in unemployment with more full time jobs added.

The US is not in a brilliant position there is a lot of political concern about the debt ceiling and major discussions about spending. We'd better wait a few years at least before declaring everything a success. And as I said the US is a major reserve currency. We simply are not that powerful anymore.

&gt; This country is facing a very real danger of undergoing net zero growth for a significant period of time, and that's something which must be avoided.

You're ok with growth at any cost? Regardless of the sustainability? Basically you'd be happy going from one bubble to the next until the entire thing implodes? 

&gt; GBP growth in value vs. Gold

I honestly never understood the point of measureing value against gold. For starters we use a lot more of it industrialy than we used to. There are so many things affecting asset prices that to measure a currency against one doesn't make much sense to me. I know gold is valuable to some but until you can eat it I'd prefer the Potato standard.

&gt; Now check out comparative currencies - The pound has lost so much value internationally in the last few years. No-one gets pay rises. Bills increase. Food costs more. Anything imported costs even more. Taxes are higher.

A much better point, though for the EUR and USD the main value lost was since 2008 and this is due to banking being an important part of our export wealth. Other costs hav risen for a multitude of reasons and yes there is some validity to your point here but simply borrowing money to build things isn't going to solve those issues. 

&gt; I'm not pretending people are starving like a lot of lefties do, almost no-one is and if they are there's normally stuff they can do about that, but things aren't great, and we can't afford to stand still.

I agree, but simply spending more money when we can't afford it and hoping that we somehow manage to pay it all off in the future is fairy thinking. Why not encourage the government to buy Euromillions tickets?

You can be right there, but I have already been called a free rider in this thread just because we do not want in.

Besides, apart from that Sweden (who has the 2nd highest taxes in the world anyway) should have the choice not to do it (as any country). 

&gt;The market stability which could be gained though... WILL benefit most investors (there is published research saying that the market disproportionately rewards small improvements in stability). 

I hope you are right. No harm if you are, just good. 

Some of the reason I have heard for the FTT is that the Eurozone countries need money. One of the real problems I have with the Eurozone, is that they refuse to actually deal with the root of the issue, and they refuse to let people vote about it. 

If you are an economist, you know better than I do, that the Euro is wrongly constructed, and it needs to be re-constructed, the sooner the better. And, when that happens, to cure the democratic deficit, the people of the Euro countries (and those waiting to join in) need to be allowed to vote. However, that is not what is happening. If the reason of the FTT is to bring stability - fine, hope it works, I think it is wonderful that some try, and that we can stay outside. 

However, if it is needed as another Euro band aid- then it is hopeless. You do not fix the Euro with more taxes.

""DAVOS, Switzerland — Is the euro crisis over? A leading U.S. economist says not by a long shot.


Even as the head of the European Central Bank talked Friday of “positive contagion” in the markets and predicted an economic recovery for the recession-hit eurozone later this year, economist Barry Eichengreen warned that the debt crisis that has shaken Europe to its core could easily erupt again this year unless European leaders move faster to solve their problems.


While European governments and markets have been breathing easier in recent months after years of turmoil, it’s no time for complacency, said Eichengreen, who has chronicled the Great Depression and explored the consequences of a breakup of the euro currency used by 17 nations.
 “Nothing has been resolved in the eurozone, where markets have swung from undue pessimism to undue optimism,” Eichengreen told The Associated Press in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “They said all the right things last year ... and they’ve been backtracking ever since.”
He warns that the crisis over too much debt burdening governments and banks in the 17-country currency group “is going to heat up again in 2013.”


He urged eurozone leaders follow up on its proposals to steady its banking system and keep failed banks from adding to government debt through expensive bailouts.


European leaders in Davos this week are seeking to reassure investors and corporate leaders that the continent is on the mend after its punishing debt crises.


European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Friday forecast a recovery in the eurozone economy in the second half of the year, and spoke of “a new restored sense of relative tranquility” and “positive contagion on the financial markets.”


But he acknowledged “we don’t see this being transmitted into the real economy yet.”
Draghi said governments need to move ahead with structural reforms to make their economies grow faster, which will help reduce government debt.


Heavily indebted countries such as Spain and Italy faced alarmingly high borrowing costs on bond markets last year, as investors wondered whether they would be able to keep paying their debts. Those bond market rates fell after key steps by European leaders. One was the European Central Bank’s offer to purchase bonds issued by indebted countries if they promise to reduce their deficits. Another was a proposal to set up a so-called banking union that would keep failed banks from bankrupting any one country by transferring the supervision of bank behavior and finances to a single, central EU supervisor at the ECB.


Europe, meanwhile, is in a recession that is putting added pressure on government finances.
 “Europeans will be shocked out of their complacency, I think, soon enough,” Eichengreen said. “There will be a relapse to the greater volatility of the first half of last year.”
 “None of the underlying problems have been solved. There is no economic growth in Europe. Germany itself is on the verge of recession. The banking union doesn’t exist. There’s less consensus on completing it than we thought last year, so the markets are going to lose patience at some point and the crisis will be back. “
Eichengreen, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, studied the possibility of a eurozone breakup long before the crisis that started in late 2009 forced other people to consider what was once unthinkable. He concluded that leaving the euro would be disastrously expensive and cause widespread chaos for any country that tries it.


Political leaders are aware of those high costs, which means a country such as debt-strapped Greece leaving the eurozone “is off the table for the moment,” he said.


Concerns about Europe’s economic future — and the threat that Britain could one day pull out of the European Union, whose 27 members together make up the world’s largest economy — clouded this year’s gathering in the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos.""

We don't want to pay back all government debt. It's the non-government's savings, by accounting definition.

We live in a world where money is created through issuance of debt, and is a zero sum game from then on. For someone to accrue savings, another has to accrue debt. For an entire sector (of government, foreign, and private) to accrue savings in the currency on issue, one of the other two sectors has to be in net debt. So if foreigners want to hold the pound and we ""pay back the debt"", we'd have removed all net savings of households. And for what?

This is why Japan has such high debt - the Japanese are aging, and accordingly frugal. Not willing to create money through borrowing, they instead rely on the government to accrue debt (which presents as their savings - it's no coincidence that most of their financial institutions, pension funds etc hold a lot of government bonds). So why fight it? Why force paying back the debt if it means insufficient spending for full employment? Why not just allow the non-government's savings to increase when they desire it, ie in a recession, and pay it down when/if the economy is running at capacity? Just don't force it out of turn, there's just no need. The currency-issuer should merely respond to the need of the currency-users, there's really nothing to be gained from ever having spending insufficient to utilise all available labour.",0,1359131414,null,0,false,0,c83eutn,t3_1792x1,t1_c83eutn,t1_c83ekil,null,1431076112,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

When half the EU budget goes towards CAP, and yet when the UK has some of the largest, most efficient farms, but obviously fewer of them in total number, the CAP doesn't represent UK farms for the better, but allows continental farms to close the gap.  The Scottish even forced information using the freedom of information act.  In it they found that corporations like Nestle and Tate&amp;Lyle had received billions over the last decade, whilst the average Scottish farmer had only received £9,000 per annum.   Why are we subsidising huge corporations that already turn massive profits?  From the UK perspective the UK wants to be able to take nothing from CAP and, if subsidies are necessary, to be able to tailor them for their own needs, to the most deserving, out of their *own* pocket.

**FISHING:**

 People are all too fond of reminding the UK that they're an island on the corner of Europe.  That also means we have a massive amount of coastline for our size and we have a large sea on one side and a large ocean on the other.  When the Spanish joined the CFP the size of the European shipping fleet doubled in size.  For 30 years since the UK, and conservationists, have argued constantly for meaningful reform.  Every year 800,000 tonnes of fish are dumped back into British waters (British under international maritime law), dead, because of policy which has turned out to be impossible to reform.  Completely counter productive to economy and conservation.  Being an island this hits the UK disproportionately hard.  Dropping out of the CFP would provide the UK with an extra £2.5bn a year before counting the extra costs of bureaucracy attached to managing the CFP; preserving a dying industry, removing some of the most harmful practices in UK waters, stopping over fishing through the numbers of ships, and providing a huge boon to conservation.   That's not to say that the CFP couldn't continue on its own without the UK, but after 30 years, and a decade review last year which delivered nothing meaningful, the UK is being hardest hit, and continues to be so.

**TRADE:**

To address the UK's need for a trade commissioner.   The UK economy is unique to Europe.  Just as the economy differs greatly between North and South Europe, the UK in turn differs from the North with far more emphasis on finance and services.  This means that when an EU trade commissioner goes on an overseas delegation on behalf of the whole EU, the UK's needs are not indicative.  When the EU sent a delegation to India, India specifically had one thing on its bucket list: financial services.  The UK had one thing on its bucket list: financial services.  The Indians and UK were frustrated and manacled to negotiating around textiles and farming *for months*.  Are we expected to believe an EU commissioner best represents UK financial services when the UK, along with the Czech Republic, were the only two states which refused the EU fiscal compact?  

The UK doesn't *need* to be part of a large trading bloc, although it can still be part of that bloc and expect those trading through it with Europe to meet all the EU requirements, because of what its products are. We don't need to intimidate China to get a great deal any more than Germany needs to intimidate South America to get them to drive German cars.  They want high end machinery designed to make cheap low end products - they come to the UK.  If they want to extenuate a global footprint in finance, it's London.  They want high end innovation, financial services and banking, top grade pharmaceuticals and chemicals.  We don't need the EU to help sell these.  We also shouldn't need the EU to trade with countries whom we share a Head Of State with!  It's not an argument of empire.  The commonwealth is built on recognising full sovereignty of others.  It's just that through a fluke of history we find ourselves with a shared language, culture and history outside the EU, as well as having links to the EU, and going through the EU doesn't help the UK in these matters e.g.  Switzerland should not be able to negotiate a free trade agreement with Canada faster than the UK.

**POLITICAL INTEGRATION/SOVEREIGNTY:**

Then there's the matter of Federalism.

In 1975 Edward Heath said,
 
           ""Fears that we shall in some way lose sovereignty or
            independence are, I need hardly say, completely 
            unjustified.""

That is how the UK voted.  They never wanted political unity or judicial courts.  For almost 40 years now it's small wonder that the UK has grown increasingly concerned.  They've even been arguing for this debate since 1992 and Maastricht.  Every time they secure opt outs and vetoes, legally and which others agree to, and then are harassed when they choose to exercise them.  

----------------------

**The UK response to this is now fair:**  

You may have your federalism and the UK will never step in your way again.  EU countries shouldn't however be bullied into either this vision of the EU or nothing.  Let those that wish to go down that route, do so, but also let those that wish for a more flexible economic vision retain that too.  There is no reason why it can't happen.  Also, you should stop forcing countries into a currency as a necessary cost of joining Europe.  It's disingenuous.

 The UK is actually saying it will continue to be a net contributor, will continue contributing in European projects and defence.  It is saying it will get out of the way of federalism and deeper political integration for those members that need it.  It is also saying that over regulation, commitment to wasteful and detrimental programmes for member states who they don't represent, is killing competition __within__ the EU, which is why countries in the EU are finding themselves forced to request bailouts.  That the EU can have both: *further integration and homogeneity for those that need it in the Euro, flexibility based around the Common Market for those that don't and aren't.*


------


THE DEBATE CURRENTLY ISN'T IN OR OUT, NOR SHOULD IT BE ALLOWED TO BE FRAMED AS SUCH:      
It's reform, until 2015 at least.

The debate for in or out is simple, since that's what you asked for:  

The UK is already a signatory of the EEAA which guarantees the four freedoms i.e. the Common Market, signed outside of the EU and Maastricht/Lisbon.  As such all the above arguments for UK and EU reform still apply to the potential UK exit.  EEA contributions are considerably less than those of the EU, and the UK would only have to agree to regulations relating to the Common Market.  Using the Icelandic ratio that means approximately only ~7% of them - whilst retaining all the benefits for the UK, control of the Agriculture and Fishing, and flexibility in trade outside the EU whilst still being a member of the common market.

                    ""A report by the EFTA Secretariat in Brussels 
                     for the Icelandic Foreign Ministry that was published 
                     in May 2005, only some 6.5% of EU regulations, 
                     directives and decisions had fallen under the EEA 
                     Agreement over the first eleven years of its
                     existence, a total of 2,527 pieces of legislation.  
                     Of those only 101 required a change to Icelandic 
                     laws already in place.""

If more UK people knew that, there wouldn't be need for a debate!

Simon Epstein rappelle aussi que les antisémites abondent dans la Résistance, aussi bien dans les réseaux et les maquis, qu'à Londres ou à Alger. En particulier il y a une surreprésentation par rapport à leur poids politique des militants d'extrême droite, en particulier antisémites, parmi les fondateurs de la Résistance et les premiers soutiens du général de Gaulle.

Again with the rudeness. There is simply no need for this cuntishness you're bringing to the conversation.

&gt;They weren't even a collection of states, they were colonies. It was a completely different scenario.

Until the colonies ratified the US constitution and became US states, which is exactly what I'm talking about. The newly born US states were under a fairly weak federal government, running the majority of their own affairs with a very gradual transition of power over to the federal government.

&gt;And you accuse me of being simplistic but you strip off myriad defining characteristics and focus on one commonality of increased federalism?

I was simply making the comparison between the slow evolution of US federalism and what I view to be the impending slow growth of EU federalism. That is all. I was not saying we're going to go west and hunt mexicans, or that we're going to create little patches of land for all the Amish.

&gt;Even if it did make us powerful; to what end? A military power? A political power? Again; for what?

Survival, supremacy, wealth, the ability to ensure fairness in the world and protect those who are wronged.

&gt;How seriously is anyone going to take a country when citizens can't even communicate with each other on the most basic level?

You talking about China with it's 7 different languages?

51% of the EU speaks English, that's increasing fast. In a generation or so everyone will speak English.

Here comes the US and their lovely civil war to dig me out of that one...

&gt;No. No. There is plenty of reason as to why not. The EU is completely undemocratic.

No. It's perfectly democratic, it's just not a direct democracy.

&gt;I wasn't consulted on the formation of the EC.

You mean the EEC? There was a referendum in 1975, 67% voted in favour of staying in the European commuities. Since then, you influence the EU via your democratically elected politicians. Do you appoint the foreign secretary? No, of course you don't. I don't hear people complaining that that's horribly undemocratic.

&gt; In fact the only reason why it even exists is because the French public wasted the European Constitution in a referendum and the Lisbon Treaty was the Eurocrats' workaround. Sound like a bona fide election right there. Win.

You don't have to a vote on something directly for it to be democratic. The EU *is* that though, you don't want to be a member, vote UKIP. Enough people vote, and happy days England can go off on its merry way. 

Our EU commissioner in Brussels was chosen by UK politicians.

The EU Parliament has direct elections which you vote in (don't you?).

The EU Council is just our heads of state or foreign secretaries, who again we voted for.

The Council of the European Union is formed on an ad-hoc basis by elected national ministers depending on topic

Finally the president of the Commission is advocated for by the council (member states' head of state) and voted for by the Parliament (directly elected).

Van Rompuy was elected by the EU Council (again, senior members of each member state's national government)

No, but you're not just being out-competed by Bangladesh. You're being outcompeted by places like Canada.

It's really hard to hire someone in the EU, and damn near impossible to fire them later(and incredibly expensive if you do). I know lots of business owners, and the hiring/firing process is one of the primary reasons they won't hire in Europe. Canada has found a good middle ground - fair to the workers, but not overly burdensome on employers. As a result a full half of our company is there.

Second, I agree with your overall point (moderate religion is fine, crazy religion is not) but your examples contradict what you are saying about Islam in France. Eating Halal is (IMHO) completely useless and stupid, but it's pretty damn personal and doesn't negatively affect anyone. The fact that many people eat Halal is used by the extreme right to implicitly say ""there are too many of these dirty foreigners"".

true,Mshotts,UNSA,United States of America,"I'm supporting the proposed assault weapons ban. I understand that very few murders are committed with these weapons, I'll even agree it shouldn't be the main focus, but they should still be banned. As far as handguns go, the average modern handgun still has much more killing power (rounds per minute) than a historical musket. My point is, times have changed and the amendment needs to change to reflect the times we live in, not the time in which it was written.

I'm not advocating complete removal of the second amendment, far from it. That being said, the time is long past for *common sense* measures, which according to polling, most Americans (even gun owners and NRA members) are in favor of. *Mandatory* background and mental health checks, better access to mental health care, more thorough and strict licensing procedures, better and more efficient enforcement of existing laws and stamp out all of the gun show loopholes. 

Also, you can make all the laws in the world and it won't make a difference with the saturation in the American gun market. We are the most heavily armed private population on the planet (something like 90 firearms for every 100 people). Tax the shit out of firearms and ammunition, tax the shit out of manufacturers. Get guns off the street. After evidence has been collected from guns used in crimes, destroy them. Market saturation needs to go way down before we'll see a dent in gun violence, the availability is ridiculous.

Finally, gun violence is not only a problem in and of itself, it's also a symptom of deeper cultural and societal issues. Including but not limited to: Welfare, education, economic inequality and lack of opportunity and others.

true,mberre,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Even when they trade in the billions? Can you be sure?

Sure. It's not a question of scale, its a question of *which sort of transactions you do.* 

Basically, if you have a high volume of transaction *relative to how large your portfolio is (basically, if you engage in speculatory sorts of trading)*, then you'd end up racking up a big tax bill. 

It means that large institutional investors (mostly pension funds who buy and hold), and small individual investors are favored, while hedge-funds, highly-leveraged investors, and day traders end up footing most of the tax bill. 

If for example, I would buy $ 1,000,000,000 ($1 Billion)... then my FTT bill at 0.10% comes to: $1,000,000 ($1 million). It sounds like a lot, until you consider that dividends might completely negate that in 3 months time. On top of that, capital gains would negate that within one trading day. A $0.11 gain on initial share price should do it. If I have a buy and hols strategy... you'd probably hold the shares for at least a couple of weeks.... institutional investors would probably hold the shares for at least a couple of months.... so that extra five or ten cents paid per share won't really figure into the calculation. 

If on the other hand, if I would take the $1 Billion and use it leverage at a 10:1 ratio (pre-crisis, US banks were at 40:1)... then use my $10 Billion to day-trade... I would buy, sell ,buy , sell , buy , and sell in a single trading day (this would add very little informational value to the financial market, but contribute greatly to its volatility).....then my tax bill for that day's transactions would be:

$60,000,000 ($60 Million). You can see how several trading days worth of transactions would tun expensive rather quickly. That is exactly the sort of behavior which economists want to see discouraged. In the classical economic view, financial markets are supposed to efficiently channel savings into real projects in the real economy in an efficient way.

&gt; Some of the reason I have heard for the FTT is that the Eurozone countries need money.

Yeah.. there's also a lot of money to be made here. If both buyer and seller paid me a penny for every $10 share that changes hands in a single trading day in Paris... then I'd be able to pay the deficit myself.

Also the idea that there was massive movements of people (the Saxons into England, the northern Iberians into Ireland and the Gaels into Scotland) has been dismissed by many historians who now follow a model of cultural rather than genetic migration, not saying genetics doesn't play it's part but only a small part. 

In fact even in terms of culture it's rather vague since modern Celts do not have a lot in common with ancient ones. In terms of culture it is about a continuum from the ancient celtic culture to the modern one and shared culture, the most important of this is viewed as an indigenous Celtic language (which are linked to the ancient celtic languages).

I don't know if *any* currency union is perfect - a Swedish MP once said (jokingly of course, but at that time there was a grain of truth in it) that Norrland (the north of Sweden, 2/3 of the country to be exact) should really have their own currency.........So, not even a small country like us a an ideal union, really. 

Still, if one start looking at at ""good"", or at least working currency unions and what they have in common a few things crystallize.

* it is good if the members have somewhat similar but also a bit diverisfied structure. The risk for ""asymmetrical chocks (is that the right word in English?) lessens. The Euro states are to different in that matter (particularely if you don't have any proper transfers in place) Finlands problem with Nokia and Greece's tourists problems are hardly the same. 

* a high mobility among workers - the Euro don't have that, if you compare with the US for example. 

* If the workers will not move, the salaries have too. The germans for example have been denied their salary increase. There need to be a high flexibility among salaries/prices.

* They have more also need more, (democratically decided) transfer systems across borders, like the in between states transfer system in the US

* The difference parts of the union have to hold of their part of the bargain so to say. In the Euro,  we can say that about Finland....If they can't, there need to be controls, stronger than we have. 


* A bank union. A central bank that can act freely. Common bank guarantees/bank rules  to end the risk of bank runs for example. 

* A finance union which also leads to a political union. With finance politics and social political transfers one can help regions that are behind. 

All this leads to a union.


*Above all - this need to be *democratically decided and supported by the people*. Sure, the Americans might dislike/joke about Louisiana or some other state that are constantly on the receiving end, but they are hardly about to throw them out. As it is now, the Euro, has gone from the German - ""No transfers at all"", to sneakingly letting tax payers from one country pay off other countries debt. Slowly guaranteeing other countries banks, with money from where? That needs to be in a proper union sure- but you let people vote about it. 

There are a million things to say about the Euro, but the fact is, that what mostly worries me, above all, is the democratic deficiency. Slowly, slowly, they political leaders in the EU are sneaking in more and more things that were not only not agree upon, they were explicitly said *not* to happen. Or, as it states in the ECB rules. ""Each country is repsonsible for their own debt"". ""No country should pay for any other country"". That doesn't work, I know that - but *we need to vote about it*.

The way I see it, it is not only a bad currency union, it is becoming a dictatorship, slowly. How undemocratic can it be allowed to be before someone reacts?

Unless you have proof that a majority (or at least non negligible minority) of Muslims in France want that, it's a slippery slope fallacy.

I agree that Halal (and Kosher) killings can be cruel, and those should be outlawed. I appreciate that you mentioned Judaism and I'd like to point out that nobody ever does, which to me shows that this isn't about animal cruelty for most people (I have a hard time believe Le Pen cares about animals). Now to get back to Halal, I think it's possible to stun the animal, as long as it's still alive (and the blood can be drained). I remember reading about it a few years back. Now some might think it's not actually Halal, but that shouldn't affect the law. This is a problem with PC in the EU/France, not with Muslims.

The same is true for ramadan. I'm OK with someone leaving work for religious reasons, but that should be either part of a paid-leave (RTT) or unpaid leave.

The problem was that the soldiers the Scottish commander had were not the battle hardened veterans, who'd fought with Gustav Aodlphus in the 30 years war, the Scottish Covenanters had relied on before. The Battle was lost partly through a series of unfortunate events, the English army appeared to be retreating as it had done badly in Scotland and Leslie decide to advance on them and meet them at Dunbar. The army was being paid for jointly by the Parliament and the Kirk so he was pressured to finish it quickly (as it was expensive) so he decided to attack but the army became wedged and Cromwell then famously saw an opportunity and attacked the ill positioned Scottish army and won decisively. After that Cromwell quickly took Edinburgh and this broke any Scottish resistance. 

Any lack of resistance in comparison to Ireland would in my opinion be down to the fact that Scotland was a centralized Kingdom unlike Ireland so as soon as Cromwell held the capital there wasn't much to resist him, also Cromwell was a puritan Protestant and so therefore the Scots who were Presbyterian would have had less issue with his leadership whereas the Catholic Irish would have been less happy.

*A bank union. A central bank that can act freely. Common bank guarantees/bank rules to end the risk of bank runs for example.


*A finance union which also leads to a political union. With finance politics and social political transfers one can help regions that are behind.

To that, I'd like to add a note about a competent central bank. At the moment, the role of the ECB is basically too narrow. Under Draghi, the ECB has spent too much time saying ""well, we could respond, but that would just be outside of our mandate."" 

In fact, the more diverse the currency union, the more strategic the central bank has to be. I'm an american living in Europe, and I can tell you, the Fed, and the bank of Canada... interpret their role broadly, and engage in a lot of effort to try to maximize growth and stability are the *entire* currency zone. Meanwhile, the ECB mainly plays to German interests. Which are... relatively high interest rates, one (instead of multiple) policy goal (price stability), and a general refusal to even do that one well if problems arise in the southern part of the Eurozone rather than in Germany. 

To make things correct, I'd say that monetary policy should become more ""anglo-saxon"", preferably built on the Canadian model, meaning that BOTH economic growth and price stability are taken into consideration. ""economic growth"" meaning the fostering of a diversified economy, and with special attention towards balancing the interests of poorer regions. ""Price stability"" should mean worry about inflation, deflation, and asset bubbles. To that end, the BOC and now the Bank of England are also getting involved in regulating the financial markets too. 

As for transfer systems across borders, the US actually does not have a system like that. The FEDERAL government subsidizes the poorer states. The richer states don't. This was precisely the sort of policy Merkel spent so much time trying to block. Otherwise, the Dutch, the Belgians, the Finns and the Luxembourgers could have helped to shoulder the cost. Instead, they have suffered increased sovereign risk premia due to inaction with respect to the crisis...and and now having to engage in small-scale austerity. 

As for the democracy deficit, I also wonder how far things will go before things begin to happen. At the EU level, what I would like to see is a massive transfer of authority and responsibility toward the parliament and away from any organs of the EU which are un-elected. The Council and the commission need to become smaller and more symbolic, while the parliament becomes less symbolic and more of a real parliament.

true,Lord_Monboddo,SCOT,Scotland,"I'm not sure why your so annoyed about it, I politely disagreed I'm not stretching this into a political matter, I know it is that way for some but it don't consider it a political matter. I'm not on about Celtic pride as you suggest in fact I even pointed out that I consider Celticness a pretty woolly term. Still the term Celt as used in it's modern usuage can apply to the modern cultures in my opinion. I'll try and answer your points here but let's not get into a political discussion of it and keep it friendly.

&gt;There is no such thing as ""Celtic culture"", that is unless you are in to worshiping forest gods and throwing people into peat bogs.

I disagree there is Celtic art, music and language that is the basis of a culture and there are shared elements of literature and traditions across the Celtic countries. It's not to do with religion and even then if you look at traditional events they can be linked to Celtic religions (Beltane, Halloween, Hogmanay).

&gt;The Celts were a tribal people who invaded the Island of Great Britain probably around 500BC and were subsequently massacred/interbred with the Romans to form the Romano-British mongrel.

They didn't invade the Celtic culture spread culturally. Historians are split over whether it can be even considered an ethincity and it is generally looked at as more a culture than an ethinicty. They did inbreed with the Romans that is true (although bear in mind the Romans only ever reached the southern part of Scotland and none of Ireland). Also the Romans themselves were a mixed bunch ethnically anyway.

&gt;The Celts never made it across the Irish sea to Ireland in any great numbers (A tiny proportion of Scottish Celts did, but they were a negligible amount).

I still don't accept like most modern historians the idea of mass migrations of people, anyway the Celtic culture came to Ireland separately than it did in Britain, hence Gael culture which originates in Ireland not Britain. Scotland was originally different and contained Brytonnic Celts and Pictish celts (who didn't speak Gaelic but their own Celtic languages). Also where are you getting this ""tiny proportion of Scottish celts"", I can't for the life of me think what your meaning other than Scottish Gaels going to work and live in Ireland but that was because the Irish were Gaelic too.

&gt;Modern day Irish people have genealogically speaking been there for over 9000 years, and have changed very little.

It is very rare that anyone anywhere could trace their origins to the same general geographic location back 9000 years, that really doesn't make any sense. Anyway as I said you're arguing genetics and ethnicity, Gaelic and Celtic culture came to Ireland separately and it was unlikely it was a genetic or ethnic transferal (although yes I agree there was some migration from Celtic Spain and this likely affected Irish culture).

&gt;Scots Gaelic is a language influenced by a (by this point, virtually non-existant) Celtic people.

This makes the least sense of all since Scots Gaelic is influenced by Irish gaelic (or more specifically it's route language is Old Irish), the reason we have Gaelic is Scotland is because it came from Ireland. Originally Scotland would have spoken Brytonnic in the South and Pictish in the north which are fairly different, although Picitish has been lost to us. When and why Scotland became more Gaelic is still a matter of controversy, the most plausible explanation is it came with Christianity and the cult of St Colomba (a Gaelic speaking Irishman). Also on your last point I'm still not arguing we are genetically Celtic I'm saying that the cultures of Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Britanny are influenced by Celtic culture.

&gt;The Irish had their first major invasion of Scots Gaels in the 13th century, and they fucking hated eachother.

Huh? As I said before the Gaelic culture came to Scotland from Ireland (Ulster specifically) so I'm not sure why you believe the Gaels originated from Scotland and came to Ireland, that is completely false and no historian would agree (unless you are talking about Scots Gaels working in the Irish Gaelic world). I'm also confused about what invasion you are talking about, other than the invasion by Edward Bruce but that wasn't the Gaels specifically and didn't happen till the 14th century. Also how could you explain the Irish Gaels and Scots Gaels hating each other they were commonly travelling back and forth and living in each others countries, Scottish Gaelic mercenaries famously fought in Irish Gaels armies (the Gallowglasses and Redshanks).

&gt;Tl'dr: No Celts in Ireland, culturally or otherwise.

Well you have your opinion but your argument was quite flawed in my opinion and had a few basic mistakes. The biggest one was suggesting Scots using Scots Gaelic made them a bit Celtic even though Gaelic comes originally from Irish, therefore the Irish must be a bit Celtic too by your logic. Scots Gaelic appeared in the Western Isles around the time of settlers from Ulster and the later Kingdom of Dal Riata, it then spread (presumably culturally) through the rest of Scotland and the founding of the Kingdom of Alba (the first instance of Scotland when it still spoke Gaelic, Alba being the Gaelic word for Scotland).

My tl,dr: The Irish, Scots, Welsh, Bretons (and I forgot the Cornish before) have good reasons to call themselves culturally Celtic but if you get into genetics or ethnicity it makes less sense. As far as I'm concerned though it has little bearing on modern politics or society of these countries and people.

true,OldTimeGentleman,null,null,"Il me semble que cet avis est, en effet, le plus proche de la réalité, sauf que je dirai plutôt que c'est lorsque la religion *semble* coupée du pouvoir politique qu'elle apparaît comme tolérante.

Prenons par exemple notre beau pays : les Catholiques restent le plus possible en dehors du débat politique, et donc la religion est vue comme 'tolérante'. Mais dès qu'ils essayent d'influencer un débat politique - le mariage gay - d'un coup, on retourne à une vision du Catholicisme qui est 'restrictif'.

La vérité, pourtant, est que la relation entre la religion Catholique et la politique n'a pas changé.

Notre loi est basée sur notre culture : une culture qui, à la base, est Catholique. L'Eglise n'a donc pas à râler contre la loi, puisque la loi pense presque de la même façon que l'Eglise. Sauf que bien sûr, cette culture évolue alors que la religion reste relativement fixe. Et donc il arrive des moments où l'Eglise doit se lever contre l'état; Créant cette image de l'Eglise 'intolérante'.

Mais du coup, comme la France n'est pas basée sur l'Islam, elle se trouve beaucoup plus souvent en contradiction avec lui. Par exemple, lorsqu'un homme vole en France, on le met en prison, où il est logé et nourri (théoriquement...). Cela vient de l'idée que nous sommes tous des pécheurs, et que l'on mérite d'être traité humainement quoi que l'on ai fait. Dans la loi Islamiste, on lui coupe la main, car dans la culture Musulmane, l'homme doit assumer les conséquences de ses actes - à acte grave, conséquence grave.

Chose assez drôle (enfin...) en ces temps de crise, la gauche et l'extrême gauche non anarchiste à une tendance à vouloir utiliser de protectionnisme et à vouloir rétablir un certain ordre, ce qui est une composante forte du bonapartisme.

Effectivement Cameron rentre pas vraiment dans ces droites Françaises. Mais faut pas oublier que son parti c'est le parti conservateur, qui est assez traditionnel, mais Cameron fait partie des plus libéraux du parti Conservateur, et donc plus progressiste que son parti sur les questions sociétale. Eh puis faut pas oublier qu'il est au pouvoir, contrairement à notre droite qui est dans l'opposition, et donc a plus d'intérêt à être contre.
Rajoutons à cela que je ne sais pas ce qu'il en est de l'adoption ou autre dans ce projet de loi.

Gäbe es heutzutage noch Nazis die sagen würden ''Naja, das mit den Juden machen wird nicht mehr, aber die Schwulen ärgern und nach Afrika gehen und Kondome schlecht reden, also das sollten wir schon noch dürfen.'' würde ich sie genau so verurteilen. Die Kirche hat über Jahrtausende *unzählige* Menschen diskriminiert, unterdrückt und abgeschlachtet. Nur weil sie, ''Gott sei Dank'', dank der Wissenschaft, der Evolution/Emanzipation der Gesellschaften und dem freien Zugang zu Informationen an Macht verloren hat wird sie nicht plötzlich ''heilig''. Religionen sind das schlimmste was der Menschheit je passiert ist und haben mehr Opfer gefordert als alle andere Tragödien zusammen. Wir sind nun endlich and einem Punkt angelangt, wo Menschen erwachen und sich langsam aber sicher von traditionellen Zwängen befreien und sich selbst bestimmen können. 

&gt;Ich kenne viele Leute, die kirchlich arbeiten - und denen allen geht es um Hilfe, Miteinander und Nächstenliebe, nicht darum,  Kindergehirnzuwaschen.

Genau gleich geht es den meisten Scientologen oder anderen Sekten-Angehörigen. Die Kirche ist nichts anderes als eine Sekte, period. Viele Leute machen viele falsche Dinge aus vermeindlich guten Gründe. ''Hell is paved with good intentions.'' Wie viele Leute kennst du, die nicht aus der Armut kommen, Zugang zu freien Informationen hatten und nicht von der Familie in eine Religion hinein gedrengt wurden als sie klein waren und doch katholisch sind? Mann könnte fast meinen das sich die Leute nicht bewusst dafür entscheiden, lustig oder? Die Kirche ist eine Sekte wie jede andere, die Leuten bewusst oder unterbewusst gefangen hält.

&gt;Was tut die christliche Kirche hier (in Deutschland) und heute (nicht vor Jahrhunderten) denn so bitterböses? Er redet explizit von einer heute stattfindenden Indoktrinierung und beschuldigt so unschuldige Lehrer, Geistliche und Eltern.

Was tun den andere Sekten so bitterböses? Die Kirche will Geld und Einfluss, genau dementsprechend verhält sie sich. Neben der grossen Anzahl an Abscheulichkeiten die sie auch noch Heute von sich preisgibt, ist ihr grösstes Vergehen auch heute noch das sie den Leuten ''kompletten Scheiss'' eintrichtert und das ist beim besten Willen nichts anderes als Gehirnwäsche. Und was hat der Mensch den wertvolleres, als einen freien Willen?

Könnte das ganze noch bei Belieben expandieren und besser/intelligenter illustrieren und erklären, habe aber Heute noch anderes vor. Bottom-line ist das eine gute Kirche eine leere Kirche ist. Menschen sollen an irrationnelles glauben oder nicht, aber dies aus freien Stücken und Bewusstsein und nicht zu Gunsten Geld- und Machthungrigen kriminellen Organisationen.

true,30cities30shooters,null,null,"&gt; Atheismus ist das theologische Pendant zu Anarchie

Dann ist Theismus wohl das theologische Pendant zur militärischen Diktatur. 

&gt;Früher war dass dann eben die Ultimative Belohnung, wie beispielsweise der Himmel, heute sind andere Werte nun mal stärker im Fokus.

Sage ich auch nichts dagegen. Wir sind aber nicht mehr früher, wir haben uns entwickelt und können und weiterbilden ohne eine imaginäre Furcht. Werte sind nicht von Religionen abhänging. 

&gt;Es geht hier nicht um ""aufwachen"", das ist nämlich Verschwörungstheoretikergerede.

Beim besten Willen nicht. Wer heutzutage noch denkt das die Kirche etwas anderes ist als eine Möglichkeit an Geld und Macht zu kommen verschliesst die Augen vor der Realität. Aufwachen bedeutet hier das jeder Mann/Frau sich vom religiösen Zwang lösen kann und sich selbst eine Meinung bilden kann. Wie schon gesagt, wie viele Leute kennst du die Religiös geworden sind ohne: Armut und/oder Familieren ''Zwang''? Die meisten Religionen sind nichts anderes als jede andere Doktrine die man Leuten durch ständige Wiederholungen einimpfen kann.

&gt; Nicht weil es falsch oder böse ist, sondern weil es unnötig ist.

Gewisse Leute, sicher. Andere sehen aber auch einfach ein dass Religionen reine Seifenblasen sind und keine Daseinsberechtigung mehr haben im XXIsten Jahrhundert. Menschen sind frei, sie können machen mit ihrem Leben was Sie wollen und müssen sich nicht einer imaginären und unbelegbaren Kraft unterstellen. Noch weniger Leuten die dies ausnutzen.

&gt;Ach, laber doch nicht. Man kann die evangelische Kirche doch nicht auf eine Ebene mit Scientology stellen, damit machst du dich lächerlich. Ich kann nicht von der katholischen Kirche reden, die stellt aber zugegeben ein deutlich schlimmeres Kaliber dar als die evangelische.

Es bleiben Sekten, hin oder her. Der einzige Unterschied ist das einige grösser und älter sind als andere, und man eine Milliarde Menschen nicht gleich beherrschen kann wie ein paar Tausende. Denkst du eine Minute das die katholische Kirche (oder der Islam, oder was auch immer) anders mit ihren Gläubigen umgehen würde wenn sie könnte?

&gt;Wenn du von Kirche redest, dann verdeutliche, von welcher.

Grundsätzlich von der Katholischen das wir hier von Deutschland gesprochen haben. Die meisten Religionen und Kirchen kommen jedoch auf's selbe heraus. Ich lasse eine Tür offen für den Buddhismus, dessen Werte und Gedankengänge ich noch nicht eindringlich genug studiert habe. 

&gt;Du hast da wohl beschissene Erfahrungen gemacht, liegt wohl daran, dass du im Katholengebiet liegst und etwas verbittert wirkst.

Ueberraschenderweise nicht. Ich hatte das Glück in einer weniger religiösen Familie aufzuwachsen und mir eigene Meinungen zu bilden. Ich schätze mein Glück in dieser Geselschaft geboren zu sein und offene Eltern zu haben mit welchen ich das Thema in den letzten Jahren wieder und wieder diskutieren konnte bis auch sie ''zur Vernunft gekommen sind''. Ich habe kein Problem mit Leuten die abergläubisch sind oder an imaginären Dinge glauben - es sei jedem freigestellt und dies respektiere ich zutiefst. Ich habe lediglich ein Problem Leute ernst zunehmen, welche religiösen Doktrinen folgen und von etwas überzeugt sind, was ihnen von anderen Leuten eingeredet worden ist (und dies obwohl sie alt genug sind sich selbst damit auseinanderzusetzen).

Dude, the North of the country is huge, I don't know why they got everything in the same NUT. Portugal is very unevenly divided between the coast and the interior.

I live in [Porto](http://goo.gl/maps/WIzTY), it's the [second largest city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto) in Portugal, it's a massive [metropolitan area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Metropolitan_Area) and it has [the largest University in the country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Porto) of which I'm a student. The coast and specially Porto just isn't comparable to the rest of the North like [Trás-os-Montes](http://goo.gl/maps/Mk5Z6).

Instead of looking at the GDP per [NUT II](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/c/cd/Gross_domestic_product_%28GDP%29_per_inhabitant%2C_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28PPS%29%2C_by_NUTS_2_regions%2C_2009_%28%25_of_the_EU-27_average%2C_EU-27%3D100%29.png), look at it from [NUT III](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/0/01/Gross_domestic_product_%28GDP%29_per_inhabitant%2C_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28PPS%29%2C_by_NUTS_3_regions%2C_2009_%281%29_%28%25_of_the_EU-27_average%2C_EU-27%3D100%29_map.png), you can see Porto is between 75% to 100%, sure, it's not like what you have going on there but don't act all patronising, really, I have a good life.

If there's something I dislike more than pity is when it's unfounded, really, [this is the city I live in](http://i.imgur.com/p6E0DGM.jpg) and [here's another pic taken from city hall](http://i.imgur.com/okYV4Yw.jpg). Really, this city is great, I love it here and will gladly live here all my life provided that I find employment, something like 1000€/month would be more than enough for me to live here well enough.

This is where I've been all my life, it's where all my friends are and life is good. Also, purchasing power parity accounts for a lot, just the other day I went out to dine with my friends and I paid only 8€ for two full plates (it was a buffet so I ate all I could - it was great) and the beverages were all you could drink (I stopped at about the 10th pint, I got so fucking wasted even though it was just sangria), really dude, with that amount of money one can hardly pay for dessert there, chill, this really isn't poor-and-depressing-fuckistan, for example, here's a clip from last year's [Queima das Fitas (watch out, it's very loud)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaQogTCsvNQ) :p

There was no discussion. No facts. It was all just calling each other names, and lamenting that our world will be worse off with gay couples. And this is bullshit, because the projects were not exclusive to discussing gay issues. And even if they were - some pseudoarguments risen weren't even laughable.

Metro workers were striking for days. The government broke their strike by using an executive decree of dubious legality called a ""mobilisation order"" and also by using the police to raid the place the strikers had barricaded themselves in. 

As a response to that, the other public transport unions (buses etc) also went on strike to show their solidarity.

""We should try to shape them in the UK's national interest. Let us negotiate a new settlement for Europe that works for the UK, and let's get fresh consent for it. And it's not just right for the United Kingdom, it is necessary for Europe.""

And outside the conference rooms the London mayor was pressing the British government's case here with the IMF chief, Christine Lagarde;

*[Boris Johnson stands outside in a coat amongst a bustling crowd and a TV crew that is setting up, holding a coffee, talking to Lagarde]*

""It's the right thing for Europe, we cannot go on like this, with the Brits endlessly being the back party""

*[Lagarde cheerfully responds, then walks away]*

""And I say vive la Grande-Bretagne et vive l'Europe.""

Long live Great Britain and long live Europe, she says. Her private opinions on Mr. Cameron's stance may not be quite so good natured around this Swiss mountain resort, but he did win support from one former leading German policy-maker.

*[Axel Weber, formerly of the ECB, sits in a plaid armchair indoors]*

""I think that's a sensible proposition. As a European, and someone who's very pro-European, I hope the British public decides when that vote, or if that vote comes up, that they see the benefits.""

Back at home, more than 50 business leaders have backed Mr. Cameron. In a letter to the Times, they say ""We agree with the Prime Minister that Britain's best chance of success is as part of a reformed Europe. We need a new relationship with the EU, backed by democratic mandate.""

A third of the signatories are Conservative donors or peers. But others in the corporate world are concerned about the impact on British trade. Just under half of the exports of UK goods and services head to the EU, but there's a fear that by raising the possibility of quitting, the Prime Minister will undermine business.

*[Cut to an interview snippet with Sir Martin Sorrell, the WPP Chief Executive, who standing outside wearing a coat and a colourful scarf]*

""He's in a bit of a political predicament that he has to deal with. From a business point of view, an economic point of view, it can't be good news. At the very best, if you want to put the best gloss on it, it's neutral, and at the worst, it's negative. Negative in terms of generating uncertainty.""

For David Cameron, one key reaction to his demands for reform is all-important; that of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and she's due to speak in Davos within the next hour. Hugh Pym, BBC News.

Le ""mariage pour tous"" n'est pas strictement pour tous, parce que il sera interdit à l'Église anglicane de marier les homosexuels pour plaire à la minorité de prêtres, et toutes religions auront le droit légal de ne pas marier les homosexuels.

Ceci est signifiant pour trois raisons: 

1. Beaucoup aiment l'idée de se marier dans une Église plutôt qu'au mairie (""Register Office"" en anglais) et aussi l'aspect religieux du mariage si on est ainsi. 

2. L'Église anglicane est la religion de l'État, donc il me semble un peu hypocrite. 

3. On est déjà permis aux autres religions de laisser avoir lieu une cérémonie d'union civile. 

Donc, à mon avis, ce n'est pas le ""mariage pour tous"", mais simplement une reclassification des unions civiles, comme un apartheid moins apparent qu'auparavant.

**AGRICULTURE AND FISHING**

&gt; When half the EU budget goes towards CAP

Half of an amount means nothing. Half of €2bn is €1bn, half of €100bn is €50bn. €1bn for Malta is a lot of money, €50bn for the EU is not. The EU budget is small. This makes CAP's percentage seemingly large. It went up to 70% in the past and it will go down to 40% this year.

UK's often cited Common Market described the goals of a CAP from the very beginning. CAP was and is there for a reason. You took it as part of the deal and voted for it. CAP was reformed again and again, and will be reformed again. Quotas are already set to expire, many proposals are on the table. The agricultural ecosystem is dynamic and this should be reflected on how and where the EU spents our money. 

* The reform process has started: http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/ciolos/headlines/news/2013/01/20130124_en.htm

&gt; the CAP doesn't represent UK farms for the better, but allows continental farms to close the gap.

You don't like others to have advantages in some sectors when you don't benefit equally from it, in this case because you have a more urbanised population, but you don't have any problems with sectors where you take a special interest in. By the way your population still has to eat and you can't do it on your own.

EU isn't about maintaining imbalances, but about creating a level playing field, which means closing the gaps everywhere. Gaps lead to conflicts. That's why the EU was created for, we've learned it the hard way. You seem to think that what isn't in your interest is not of your concern. This has to do with a certain kind of mentality, not with the EU.

While I agree that abuse of the subsidies system should stop, scrapping the system altogether and returning to a national subsidy system will provide fertile ground for more distortions and more scandals.

**FISHING**

I won't repeat the same points, but I will add that fish are a *mobile* natural resource. They're *common* property. In or out, one party can't have its own way. 

* The reform process has started and is a priority for the Irish Presidency: http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/mare/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9310&amp;subweb=343&amp;lang=en


**TRADE**

&gt; The UK economy is unique to Europe.

No, it's just an economy of another EU member. We don't do exceptionalism here. Unless if by ""unique"" you mean being the clearing house for criminals manipulating rates, affecting the global economy.

&gt; Are we expected to believe an EU commissioner best represents UK financial services when the UK, along with the Czech Republic, were the only two states which refused the EU fiscal compact?

Are Labour supporters expected to believe that a Conservative-led government best represents UK's interests abroad and at home? Are Conservative supporters expected to believe that leaving the EPP was good for your country's interests in Europe? We can do this for as long as you want.

You're not the only country with an interest in financial services. Do you believe that 25 out of 27 states are stupid and don't know what is best for them? Well, you might believe this, but it would be very short-sighted of you.

&gt; We also shouldn't need the EU to trade with countries whom we share a Head Of State with! 

I couldn't help but wonder: are black and Jewish people expected to believe that you have an equal society when they are unable to reach to the post of the Head of your state?

**POLITICAL FUTURE**

&gt; They never wanted political unity or judicial courts. 

My God, again with the issue of courts. Look, you are bound by international treaties, agreements, and all that jazz. International courts already decide for you. You can't escape that. You could try, but you'd have to leave the planet.

EU courts are for matters of EU law. EU law is not a matter for intepretation from Germany, the UK, or any other country. It's a matter for an EU institution. Common Market or Common Market plus whatever you don't like, you would still be bound by some rules, and someone would have to decide in the case of a dispute. That's the European Court of Justice.

As for the European Court of Human Rights, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION.

Let me write it again.

THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE IS NOT THE EUROPEAN UNION. YOU ARE A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE. EVERYONE IN EUROPE IS A MEMBER, APART FROM BELARUS.

Do you want to take Belarus' place?

As for the political unity, you seem to forget how nations and nation-states were and are created. We're not far from the days of an undemocratic multinational empire in which you were part of. I don't see how the prospect of a democratic union could scare someone.


**THE UK RESPONSE**

&gt; The UK is actually saying it will continue to be a net contributor, will continue contributing in European projects and defence. It is saying it will get out of the way of federalism and deeper political integration for those members that need it.

The UK's *current administration* is actually saying that it wants to create a mess by undoing what has been done, for short-term political gain.


&gt; EEA contributions are considerably less than those of the EU, and the UK would only have to agree to regulations relating to the Common Market. Using the Icelandic ratio that means approximately only ~7% of them - whilst retaining all the benefits for the UK, control of the Agriculture and Fishing, and flexibility in trade outside the EU whilst still being a member of the common market.

Germany trades outside of the EU while being a member of the EU. Germany is bound by EU regulations. Germany produces things that people outside of the EU want to buy.

My friends, **you are your own problem**, the EU is not to blame. We were our own problem too, many times in the past. We reformed and got our act together. Take a hint.

My words, in the original post:

                ""As such all the above arguments for UK and EU reform 
                 still apply to the potential UK exit."" 

Everything you have just written, about what I wrote, must be reviewed in light of that revelation about what I had already written, but you had not read.  Confused yet? 

 Everything I argued for as a reform, was also applicable as a solution as an exit.   All of it, even the trade, is guaranteed, because the UK is signatory outside the EU for the common market.  There was an EFTA pdf article I linked to.

It all applied.      
All of it.

I might well respond to how you say *""Half of an amount means nothing""* when talking about the CAP contribution,

Well it does mean something.

I'd rather follow with this:  

The UK wants to remain a net contributor in many things, why should it have to go down a forced federal route?  What is written that that is the only way forward?   Why shouldn't there be reform not just for the UK agreement but for all, but especially for those not already sworn into the Euro?
