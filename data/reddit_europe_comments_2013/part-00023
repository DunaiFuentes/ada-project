true,[deleted],null,null,"The very concept of ""social stigma"" means the **assumption** there is some sort of an interesting social life in Europe with people having many friends/acquantainces and there are some people in the center of social life and some people are on the margins, and some are popular and some are not.

This assumption is wrong. We tend to be a surprisingly asocial folk. I don't know any of my neighbors, and hardly ever had a chat with coworkers that goes beyond the smallest of small talk i.e. ""Horrible weather, eh?"" ""Yeah..."" and then both back to the computer.

This is e.g. many Americans complain about when they come over: the lack of small talk, chatting with strangers, invitations... we are just asocial.

Withing such circumstances the whole question is a bit hard to interpret. We have so little social interaction that there is little room for stigma or praise.

Certainly our governments make efforts in the direction of more children, because *someone has to pay our pensions, it is a bit of a pyramid scheme* and it is generally easier with native children than with integrating migrant workers who often don't speak the language well etc. etc. So they are doing stuff like organizing flexible working hours for working moms.

**Overpopulation is a weird word and weird philosophy when Europe is concerned.** Africa, or Mumbai, or Mexico City may be overpopulated, but there are whole _counties_ in rural France or Italy getting *depopulated*. There are *whole villages for sale*. Naturally the big cities tend to get a bit crowded. Still, the commutes with the Schnellbahn in Vienna, Austria tend to be spacious and silent enough, it does not yet feel choking the same way as the Paris RER tends to feel.

I think maybe you have this kind of global view that you see one Earth, one mankind and one global overpopulation, but I think views here are much more local. And a bit more hierarchical. It sounds entirely weird to me to see yourself completely the equal or the same as some illiterate dude in Mumbai and decide that if they have too many kids then you counter-balance it with none of your own. 

This, how to put it, radically egalitarian view is very American, I think ours is more stratified, more hiearchical, we would find it hard to imagine ourselves in the ""same boat"" as the ""bodega city"" people living in uneducated misery around Mexico City or similar places. I don't think we are egalitarian enough and global enough to think ourselves as one group. More of a too much of them, not enough of us way of thinking.

But actually this may be mostly me... because most people I know don't even think so deep as to think in broader terms like ""not enough of us"", more like people strictly sticking to their own lives, their own problems. I am a bit of a political philosopher and most people see me as strangely abstract ad geeky for it.

*My personal opinion is that if you are educated enough to worry about overpopulation, we actually need more of you, and less of the kinds people who can hardly read.* 

I certainly want kids at some time, because my own life feels pointless. European life is not the turbulent, exciting life of American cities where fortunes are made or lost, more of a boring comfortism where everything is kinda nice but in a kinda uniform, boringly average way. To do nothing in my life, nothing meaningful, than to work, save a bit, and decorate our apartments, and watch the occasional movie or the occasional eating out, terrifies me. 

We need kids to give purpose and more tasks and more duties and more tasks and achievements and stuff to be proud of to fill in our comfortably dull lives, because to just live for work and rest and the occasional kinda-boring entertainment while marching every year closer to death terrifies me with its emptiness.

The fastest way to get to that part of Liguria is the A15. From Cinque Terre, take the A12 and A11 down the coast and visit Lucca. Then you can join again the Milan-Rome highway (A1) in Florence. 

The center of Italy is worth a trip (or many trips) alone; unfortunately, visiting the many nice small cities in Tuscany would require many detours. However, if you have to pick one, I suggest you don't get the A1 after Florence. Instead visit Siena, and join the A1 south-east of Siena.

Later along the A1 you can visit Orvieto. Once in Rome, visit Villa Adriana in Tivoli. I don't know much about Southern Italy, but CPace wrote about it. His suggestion to visit Carrara can also fit in this plan.

Furthermore, regarding the 'unknown adults' part, even if you don't see anything wrong with hitting an adult who's physically able to defend himself, your freedom ends at the tip of someone else's nose. Freedom of speech doesn't equate to beating someone until they agree with you; that's assault and it's covered under the criminal code.

Eating as a vegetarian can be hard. Turkish and Vietnamese Restaurants usually have some vegetarian dishes on the menu. Traditional German restaurants often don't have vegetarian dishes. But in larger towns you can also find vegetarian delis. You can look up such places in Google (Maps).

Now for the nit picking. ( It's just for fun so don't take it seriously)  


&gt;Pretty much every area had its own rules and using your hands was allowed in a lot of them. So why would they continue call it football if hands were allowed?  

Most of the time the local name wasn't football but something else.  E.G. Camp ball.  Just as hand ball is a different sport from football, one could say that camp ball is different as well.  It's not because nowadays they call all those sports ""football"" that they were football.



In King Edwards declaration it even states that what is forbidden is: HANDball, FOOTball...  That means that there is a difference between a ball sport played by throwing or kicking.


Wiliam de Spalding: ""During  the game at ball, as he KICKED the ball...""


etc.   You'll find that most of the time when the game is called by the name football it's played by foot.  When the hand is used it will have other names. 

When it comes to Rugby called Rugby football, well there the same discussion can be held as with American football. so we are back at square one. 


Or the TL:DR reply.

Pretty much every area had its own rules and using your hands was allowed in a lot of them. So why would they continue call it football if hands were allowed?

L'Europe est au bout de l'implosion après 20 ans de libéralisation et de mondialisation. On est la zone la plus ouverte économiquement du monde mais on a la croissance la plus faible.

D'un côté, les monétaristes (comme [Milton Friedman](http://www.contrepoints.org/2012/07/31/92198-milton-friedman-avait-prevu-la-crise-de-leuro)) disent qu'il aurait fallu aller plus loin (un gouvernement européen avec le retrait de toutes les restrictions sur les salaires et les prix).

De l'autre côté, les eurosceptiques disent qu'il faut aller vers moins d'Europe, avec un retour au protectionnisme au niveau national.

Je ne sais pas comment la construction d'un gouvernement mondial pourrait se faire en garantissant sa légitimité. De plus, elle aurait tendance à nier la souveraineté des peuples ainsi que les spécificités liées à chaque culture.

D'ailleurs, les instances internationales influentes (FMI, agences de notation, OMC, ONU) ne sont pas élues et sont contestées à chaque fois qu'elles prennent une décision. Elles n'ont aucun pouvoir de sanction, et je ne vois pas comment on pourrait sanctionner un pays sans contrevenir à la souveraineté du peuple de ce pays.

Le principe fondamental dans l'organisation politique, c'est la souveraineté du peuple. Tu parles de divisions, mais à qui profitent ces divisions sinon à l'oligarchie, ces fameux 1% de la population qui peuvent s'expatrier si besoin est. Ce sont eux qui ont utilisé la mondialisation pour exploiter le peuple européen. Ce sont eux qui nous ont endettés alors que les usines fermaient et que les médias nous distrayaient.

In questo modo eviti che se attaccano un sito provino ad accedere con la stessa password ad altri servizi a cui sei registrato (gmail, facebook, ecc...).

Per quanto riguarda un attacco a dizionario, il metodo proposto non rafforza e neppure indebolisce l'attacco: te sei partito dal presupposto che a priori sai la parte di password ""costante"", cosa non vera.
Inoltre l'articolo prende un algoritmo di esempio (didatticamente semplice per facilitarne la comprensione), poi ognuno può sbizzarrirsi come meglio crede.


Farsi un programma che data una master password ed un dominio crea la password finale è la migliore delle cose, però non sempre abbiamo la possibilità di portarci un programmino dietro.
Stesso discorso vale per il programma che dici te (gestore di chiave).


Poi **il 99% degli attacchi non è personale ma colpiscono una singola piattaforma/dominio**; è chiaro che se uno si accanisce contro di te e ha tutto il tempo a disposizione...ti forza qualsiasi cosa.

I don't like golf either but I know guys who would go play a course that had been used for a tournament the week before and compare how they did to the pros. I think that would make it fun. When I lived near a course for a few months it was the first time I'd seen regular people golf. This also gave me a bit more respect for the pros.

Regarding English: It usually depends on who you talk to. Assholes will be Assholes, no matter if asked in English or German ;-)

Most younger Germans had some English in school, many are able to help you in English. But older ones (&gt;35yrs) in East Germany often did not have English in school.

Honeymoon is all about being well treated, right? Paris, France... I see a restaurant at least. Some restaurants  are really above the lot, providing an amazing and unforgettable experience. A degustation menu + degustation of wines at L'atelier, for example, will be 300€ for two. Let say it can climbs up to 500 with amazing incredible wine (and they indeed have a crazy selection). L'atelier is one of Joel Robuchon's restaurant. the guy is considered by many as the best chef in the world.

There's another restaurant, not very old and not yet that much known, call Le Dauphin. It's interesting because it's discreet, have been declared one of the 5 best restaurants in the world last year by american guides, it sits in the XIXth district in Paris wich is unusual for tourists, won't costs 300 but less. The food there.. is just great.

There's a cool place I still like very much in Paris, it's classic, it's very international, also very american : the Harry's Bar. They invented the bloody mary, no less, they have the most amazing selections of whiskies in Paris, great place to have a drink after a restaurant.

So I guess they already have a nice hotel, and you can decide to treat them well for a couple of diners and a bar, you can use a nice driver service to carry them from a place to another (for example you can use Uber and operate it from abroad, they won't have to deal with or pay for it - iphone/andro app available)

Definitely agree. Despite how much Farage gets on my nerves he (least from what I've seen) seems like a reasonably honest guy.

If the newspapers don't go crazy, I might actually enjoy it. For now though, I get a little tired of the consent opinion polls on UK opinion on the EU, ect. We have at least fives year before the referendum, and that's if the Conservatives get in.

The only convert I knew was a raging antisemite (by that I mean anti-Jewish, I realize Arabs are semitic too..). His reasons for converting were hugely influenced by his antisemitism. Not that it says anything about Islam, it says more about that guy's mentality... just to be clear, I'm not trying to be a biggot. 

The article also talks about prisons and it reminds me : I also knew a guy who was in jail. During his time, he pretended to be interested in conversion to Islam, so as to not get in trouble with the Muslim-majority inmates. For years he'd visit the prison Imam, and study the Quran and all, and by doing this he had no problems with inmates. When time came for him to leave, the Imam gave him phone numbers and addresses to reach to continue his Muslim studies and conversion. He took the info, left prison, and never called the contacts once out. ",0,1359998584,null,0,false,0,c896xb7,t3_17vbyf,t1_c896xb7,t3_17vbyf,null,1431181057,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Yes, and one knows that, and one can't for example gamble on it the same way. Football has acted differently, even though it is corrupt as f-ck. As soon as I will *know* in advance, without shadow of a doubt, who will win between Arsenal/Barcelona, I will not have a problem with that, or when we all know it is staged. Now we do not. There is a reason wrestling is not in the Olympics etc, for at least Olympics claim to be about competition and fairness. It is not fair if you manipulate, lie, cheat, bribe.

I agree totally, and I think one should abandon Tour the France as well. But, you also know, that not is Lance Armstrong being sued by everyone, but also by supporters who bought his book and claim it is a lie. 

Shouldn't a normal person be able to sue someone because they willingly went against the law (it is, after all not legal to fix games) and fucks it ups for millions, as well as for that person? The gambling industry should go  after them, they mess up the odds.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"Actually since trust is entirely a subjective factor, trust can easily be measured by asking 'On a scale of 0-10, how much do you trust other people?'. If people think that they are trusting, then they are. Of course with the reservation that some people might want to answer the ""nice answer"", which is being more trusting. However, this is a phenomenen in all tested populations, so it wouldn't change anything when comparing trust levels relative to each other.

The problem with trust, when looking at it historically, is that it is only recently that the social sciences started getting interested in it. Consequently, if we go back earlier than 1980 we only have small samples at different times intervals. There's no standardization. However, what surveys we do have from before 1980 all show a lower trust level, which is indicative of the trust level having risen in modern times. And if any of the very old trust surveys are true, then we originally had the same low trust levels as much of the rest of the world. If a high trust level is something that is somehow inherent in our culture historically, then our trust level must at some time, before we could measure it, have fallen considerably, only to rise again in modern times.

Thus it would seem that trust is very much dependent on socio-economic factors. We also already know that there is a strong causal relationship between equality, education and social investments and trust.

This is a strong argument for the welfare state, and thus these results are not always welcome everywhere. ",0,1360002997,null,0,1360003203,0,c898avd,t3_17rif9,t1_c898avd,t1_c88ss7c,null,1431181706,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Huonym,null,null,"Well we did try to join the euro.

We were a fully paid up member fo the exchange rate mechanism, the ERM, the euro's precursor.

But when the pound came under market pressure in 1992 because the UK economy was out of synch with the German one, the pound couldn't hold it's 2.5% band of variation against the other european currencies and so it fell out of the ERM.

When the franc came under similar pressure a bit later that band of variation was relaxed to no less than 15%, a flexibility as available to the French as it was unavailable to the British.

So after a stich up like that you shouldn't really expect us to join the euro.

As for threatening to leave, it feels to me more like we're being pushed out so the Germans can just have a clear run at organising the whole thing fort their personal convenience.

Take the ridiculousness of Hartz IV and the European Working Time Directive.

German business gets away with paying quite a lot of their workers less than proper wages because the difference is made up by the German benefits system.   This gives German business a competitive advantage and the last I heard the Brits don't complain about it.

In the UK people tend to work longer hours because they get paid for it and this does provide the Brits some competitive advantage.  But the Germans say this is an unfair competitive advantage and want to curtail this through the European Working Time Directive.  

How utterly unreasonable is that?

Globalisation is a fact and the great majority of Brits want to be a part of the EU on reasonable terms but they are not willing to be pushed around or overly stitched up.

Le Bistrot du Peintre – XIth district – typical parisian bistrot, moderate prices, not so far from Bastille.
Racine – not a lot of room, not so cheap but not that bad, a-ma-zing dishes, you HAVE TO try the porc lard, ask for it. Also the pork cheek is a revelation.

Polidor is a suggestion from Kevin W.

Le Train Bleu – amazing high ceiling old decoration classy restaurant of the Gare de Lyon train station. They serve their veal speciality for 30 years. don’t miss super chocolate generous Profiterolles au chocolat. Not so moderate price but not that mush though

Le timbre – Kevin W. suggestion, his favorite restaurant

Chartier – cheap, kind of – super experience of typical parisian brasserie where the rudeness of the waiters is part of the experience as they are some sort of shareholders of the restaurant. Don’t be afraid of queing up outside, you have to. Good and simple food. Never tried porc feet? It’s the place to give it a shot. On the Grands Boulevards not so far from Republique

Les Itinéraires – 34 euros menu, very nice

La biche au bois – Pretty not expensive very good game food

Les marcheurs de la planete – bastille (salade/cheese/coldcuts/wine), affordable depending on wine

Les Galopins – Bastille district

La fee verte – The green fairy, Bastille District

Café des anges - super afordable

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;We agree that it is impossible for all countries to run trade surpluses at once within the Euro zone. 

They can trade with the rest of the world. What you're saying is true but only globally, not withing a particular economic zone such as the EU.

&gt;Therefore, some countries will always be in a position where money is being withdrawn to other nations

Trade deficit is not ""withdrawing money"". Money is converted to other currency on monetary borders when trading goods and services.

&gt;If the government is taxing more than it is spending, the government is then also removing money.

Money collected through taxes is spent within the very same economy shortly, providing services to the citizens.

&gt;the amount of money households are in aggregate saving is the trade surplus + the government deficit. 

Households can save in other countries' banks. The money they save is reinvested by the banks as loans and credits.

&gt;If households are desiring to save, and there is no trade surplus

Nonsense. Countries can both run a trade surplus and save money. E.g. Germany is the biggest EU exporter and German citizens have about €10 trillion in savings.

&gt;Some households will be able to save, but it'll be at the expense of others. 

How on Earth can one person save ""at the expense of another"" ? You're making nonsense claims.

&gt;. Some will be put into poverty, spending will collapse, and unemployment will rise.

Wishful thinking.

&gt;In aggregate, in your scenario, households will be losing savings - as you're supposing a trade deficit combined with neutral government budget. 

Economy is not a zero sum game. Wealth can be grown even with trade deficit, as other comparative advantages of the economy kick in. Free market self-regulates.

&gt;If saving is something they want to do, this will cause pain.

Only if the rest of the world is spending down its Euro reserves can a nation accrue Euros in this fashion.

&gt; Money is converted to other currency on monetary borders when trading goods and services.

Money is *not* converted. Money is **exchanged**. The difference is very significant as Euros cannot be created in this process.

For a Greek person to accrue Euros by exporting, there must be another Euro nation that running a trade deficit, exporting its Euros away *or* a foreign nation must be spending down their reserves of Euros.

&gt; Money collected through taxes is spent within the very same economy shortly, providing services to the citizens.

Reread. If the government is taxing more than it's spending, then Euros are being removed from circulation. Less is coming back then is being collected.

&gt; The money they save is reinvested by the banks as loans and credits.

Firstly, loans and credits do not increase the net savings of the household sector. They sum to zero. Yes, money is created in this fashion - but it's met by a matching liability. If households are in aggregate trying to save, due to - for instance - a massive crisis of confidence due to a global financial crisis, this will not help them one bit.

Secondly, banks are not limited by their reserves when they are loaning out. The process actually works the other way - loans create reserves. As citations, [here's](http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2010/201041/201041pap.pdf) a Fed document from 2010 debunking the money multiplier theory, [here's](http://www.bis.org/publ/work297.pdf) another from the Bank of International Settlements and [here's](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=20968) a corresponding article delving into the true mechanism of money creation, that it is loans first and reserves after the fact.

&gt; Countries can both run a trade surplus and save money.

Reread. ""If households are desiring to save, and there is **no** trade surplus"". Yes, if you are running a trade surplus households are accruing savings (assuming the government budget surplus is lesser). It is impossible for every country to accrue savings in this fashion though.

&gt; How on Earth can one person save ""at the expense of another"" ? You're making nonsense claims.

If we know that households are in aggregate not saving money, but we know that one household is managing to, then the accounting only works out if the other households are on average dissaving. This is what I meant by ""at the expense of another"" - in that for one household to save in a sector where the total sums to zero (or negative), other households must be losing their savings. It's the only way the accounting can work out.

A free floating currency works well as long as it is supported by something.  If Greece is the only country on the drachma then their debt will be translated as whatever the market value of the drachma is compared to the Euro.  While their situation would be better I would say it is far removed from being fixed.  

The real issue is that the model you have described cannot sum to zero if you don't expect Greece to pay back on its debts.  It is much the same as if one of the households you described purchased a car and then stopped making payments on it, but expected to keep the car, and their credit intact.  That simply does not happen because the model market is now forced from a zero-sum state into a negative-sum state.  Some amount of goods has flowed out of a country and into the Greek household and that amount of goods was not paid for.  Therefore the credit rating of the Greek household has dropped.  

This is not a conspiracy, this is economics.  Economies are NOT zero sum,  wealth and money are CREATED daily.

""Sieur"" is a modified form of ""Seigneur"" (a feudal Lord, a noble) which is great, you have ""blue"" blood!

""du Bourg"" : Bourg means the town, but in rural environnement, I found that a good translation is ""market town"" in english. This term is used today but in rural environnement and only by our elders.

""Boscheon"" : I think it refers to a primitive ""bois"", a ""buisson"" (a bush), the term is ""bosc"" in old french. A lot of family name are composed of it. 
It's a variant of ""bos"" (old french).

Bosc : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosc

bos : http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/bos#fro

So ""Boscheon"" could be in the past the name of a ""lieu-dit"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieu-dit). I don't think it could designate the name of an activity (like the blacksmith, or the guy cutting wood of cutting bushes...). You need to do more research in this way.

Another good thing about your grand-grand-grand-....-grand-father, i found the description of the blazon plus the location you gives : (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry) of him :

 ""d'azur, au pégase d'argent"" ==&gt; blue (background) with a pegasus (a winged stallion).

Google books (from a ""Nobiliaire"", a kind of a big directory refering to all nobles) : http://books.google.fr/books?id=KWeTQEppxh8C&amp;lpg=RA1-PA119&amp;ots=vK15goFvY0&amp;dq=Boscheon&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=RA1-PA119#v=onepage&amp;q=Boscheon&amp;f=false 

You can easily recreate this blazon!


There are few thing I can't explain (a professionnal can i think). In the ""nobiliaire"", the term ""election de Caudebec"" is mentionned.

Now the problem is 60 years later the FYROM people TRULY believe they are from the Ancient Macedonians . . .which is insane . . . they have ""dreams"" of taking over greece one day(lol) . . . it is funny for the most part but what angers most greeks is how other countries feel so bad for them, they agree to call them Macedonia now instead of FYROM.

In the end, this hurts the greek people because Alexander is basically the founder of Greece, and shit like this undermines our own very important history.

After skimming through it I found some interesting things:

* EU-27 share of world GDP is 25,8%

* Current account balance is actually better than it was in 2001.

* Foreign direct investment out of the EU is larger than investment into the EU. That is no surprise, what surprised me is that 18,3% of the money that goes out of the EU goes to Offshore financial centres.

* Consumer price indices have stayed about the same within 10 years.

* Short term lending rates have fallen ~2,5 times.

* Even if we complain about immigrants, the % of foreign nationals in the EU is still very low compared to the US, Australia, Saudi Arabia or even Argentina.

* The biggest surprise came from the US, I don't know how accurate these statistics are but public expenditure in the EU on healthcare is actually lower than in the US. Add private expenditure and healthcare costs in the US go to ~17% of the GDP while being ~11% in the EU. + The average person spend ~7 times more money on health than his counterpart in the EU.

* We have one of the best if not the best Gini coefficients among the G20.

* The largest manufacturing activity based on value added was Food and beverages with 11,7% of total  manufacturing for the EU. It was surprising, as I was expecting something along the lines of chemicals or machinery. But the thing that makes me happy is the fact it compromises a small % of total manufacturing. That means the economy is very diverse.

* Internal tourism compromised 70,1% of total arrivals in tourism accommodation establishments.

* We produe more roundwood and sawnwood than Canada.

* Our favourite vegetables are tomatoes.

* International trade is only abou 18% of total GDP

* The number of world patent applications by countries have become more equal but still most patents come from Japan. Japan spends more money per capita on research and development than any other country.

* There were some coal mine threads earlier, to add some information 25,7% of our electricity production comes from coal.

* There were some freshwater threads as well, so it seems we use less fresh water than the world average.

* We have the biggest maritime fleet. It is 5 times larger than the next competitor.

* Most of the stuff that we import comes from Russia and most of the stuff we export goes to Russia.",0,1360010268,null,0,1360010476,0,c89au7k,t3_17v7er,t1_c89au7k,t3_17v7er,null,1431182969,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_214_submarine#Greek_Navy_orders

&gt; The Hellenic Navy is procuring four Type 214 submarines to be known as the ""Papanikolis-class"". The first, Papanikolis, was built in Germany; the following three were scheduled for construction at [Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howaldtswerke-Deutsche_Werft)'s Hellenic Shipyards in Greece.

&gt; In December 2006, StrategyPage reported that Papanikolis was found to have numerous technical problems. Among the reported problems with the submarine were excessive propeller cavitation, overheating of the air-independent propulsion system's fuel cells, and excessive rolling in bad weather when surfaced. Seapower magazine reported the Hellenic Navy refused to accept Papanikolis; additional problems noted were inadequate air-independent propulsion system output power, inappropriate periscope vibration, sonar flank array problems and seawater leakage into the ship's hydraulics.

&gt; The Hellenic Navy officers in charge of the testing program at the Kiel shipyards (Germany) made their case clear in a 2007 investigative journalism program called ""Neoi Fakeloi"" on Skai TV (Greece). Retired Rear Admiral M. Simionakis, who had been in charge of the Papanikolis program for the navy, told the interviewer that the manufacturer had made 2 attempts to fix a severe balance problem in the submarine, including shifting 21 tons of material from the top to the bottom, yet the vessel continued to heel as much as 46 degrees in sea trials. Photographic evidence of the severe heeling was presented. In the same TV program, the officer replacing Simionakis in Kiel, Capt. K. Tziotis, listed 7 ongoing, serious problems with the vessel, including balance problems when traveling on the surface, problems with the AIP system, problems with the weapon system, problems with the periscope, and problems with flooding.",0,1360012707,null,0,false,0,c89bq24,t3_17vshi,t1_c89bq24,t3_17vshi,null,1431183444,78,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,78

Quand les économistes les plus (néo)libéraux (voir mon lien de Friedman) et les plus ""à gauche"" (par exemple Piketty) se rejoignent pour dire que l'euro a été mal conçu et a un effet néfaste sur l'économie, il faut peut-être se remettre en question. L'euro n'est pas la cause unique de nos maux, mais il a un effet néfaste sur l'économie.

&gt;Car si on produit en France pour consommer français, que va-t-il advenir de la production des autres pays que l'on consommait par exemple ? Elle va s'anéantir et du même coup créer du chômage dans ces même pays, donc encore une fois tu te dresses contre le travailleur étranger.

Mais non, je me dresse contre les entreprises multinationales qui exploitent des travailleurs dans les pays sans contraintes sociales pour vendre des biens à des pays qui s'endettent pour les acheter (car ils n'en n'ont pas les moyens), vu que ces multinationales paient leurs taxes dans des paradis fiscaux. Comme par hasard, ces multinationales contrôlent les médias, et donc peuvent faire ou défaire les hommes politiques selon leur bon vouloir, tout en transformant des citoyens en bêtes à consommer.

Il faut donc plus de régulation. Cette régulation ne pouvant se faire par les instances internationales, comme je l'ai évoqué précédemment, elle ne peut se faire que par régulation nationale, c'est à dire par protectionnisme.

&gt;en déplaçant la production en France

Il ne faut pas déplacer la production en France, il faut :

1. Arrêter de consommer ce qu'on ne peut pas payer.
2. Arrêter de produire ce qui ne peut être acheté.

&gt;on va se retrouver avec un problème d'écoulement et chaque pays va faire pareil pour écouler ce qu'il produit. Cela va être catastrophique.

Tu décris la situation actuelle, pas l'hypothétique futur lié au protectionnisme. Regarde les taux de chômage en Grèce ou en Espagne (ou en France). Qu'est-ce que tu proposes pour améliorer leur situation ?

&gt;L'augmentation de la productivité moyenne du travailleur à l'échelle mondiale a juste fait que pour la même consommation il y a de moins en moins de travail.

L'augmentation de la productivité doit être suivie d'une augmentation de salaires et des bénéfices, donc d'une augmentation de la capacité à consommer (salaires), des impôts (bénéfices), et des investissements (bénéfices). Sauf qu'il y a une fuite : on baisse les salaires, on diminue les investissements, on ne paie pas d’impôts (paradis fiscaux) et les 1% se gavent en regardant le chaos. Tu appelles ça le progrès ?

Tirer notre pays vers le bas ou les autres vers le haut, c'est la même chose, cela détermine juste la part à laquelle on a le droit dans la production mondiale.

Was die Forderungen der Rechteinhaber betrifft, die sind bekannt und belegbar, z.B. hier:

&gt;Nach Angaben des Bundesverbandes Musikindustrie (BVMI) verursacht Internetpiraterie bei Songschreibern, Künstlern, der Musikindustrie und dem Steuerzahler einen jährlichen Schaden in dreistelliger Millionenhöhe. Man setze deshalb auf ein „Konzept der Aufklärung, Abschreckung, Abmahnung“ und fordert, „die Internet-Service-Provider über das Filtern und Blockieren illegaler Inhalte stärker in die Verantwortung“ zu nehmen, wie es auf der Webseite des BVMI heißt.

&gt;„Das Urheberrecht muss im Internet durchgesetzt werden“, sagt auch Heiko Wiese, Beauftragter der Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft (SPIO). Der Verband spreche sich deshalb für die Verstärkung der internationalen strafrechtlichen Zusammenarbeit und automatisierte Warnhinweise für Streaming-Portale aus.
 
[Positionen der zentralen Akteure](http://m.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/urheberrecht/wer-fordert-was-positionen-der-zentralen-akteure-11759346.html)

&gt;II. Gesetzliches Verbot sog. intelligenter Aufnahmesoftware, mit der gezielt Musiktitel automatisiert aus dem Webradio-Angebot herausgefiltert und aufgenommen werden können

&gt;„Ähnlich wie bei der Privatkopie dürfte es [...] problematisch sein, das Verbot intelligenter Aufnahmesoftware durchzusetzen, da diese auch von ausländischen Providern angeboten und vom User genutzt werden können, ohne dass der deutsche Gesetzgeber hiergegen vorgehen könnte. Die Bundesregierung wird daher aufgefordert, auf europäischer und internationaler Ebene für eine entsprechende Stärkung des Urheberrechts und vor allem seiner Durchsetzung mit Nachdruck einzutreten. Darüber hinaus ist die so genannte ""intelligente  Aufnahmesoftware"" nicht auf Musik zu begrenzen, da es heute bereits möglich ist, auch Filme im Internet herauszufiltern und aufzunehmen, sodass ein entsprechendes gesetzliches Verbot auch auf Filmtitel auszuweiten ist.“

[Die Forderungen zum 3. Korb (6)](http://www.gulli.com/news/13417-die-forderungen-zum-3-korb-1-2010-05-29)

&gt;Gerade die „Content-Industrie“ steht auf dem Standpunkt, die Internet Service Provider würden von ihren Inhalten insofern profitieren, als der Anreiz, Zugangs-Verträge zum Internet abzuschließen, vornehmlich in den medialen Angeboten der Musik- und Verlagsbranche liege. Daraus folge 1), dass ISP wie andere Dienstleister ohne eigene Inhalte denen, die nur Inhalte anbieten, vergütungspflichtig seien, und daraus folge 2), dass die ISP als Profiteure von legal wie illegal verbreiteten Inhalten in einer besonderen Verantwortung und Pflicht stünden. Namentlich in der Pflicht, die illegale Veröffentlichung und Verbreitung von Inhalten in ihren Netzen und über ihre Zugangstore „proaktiv“ zu verhindern, was über die gesetzlich vorgeschriebene Mitwirkungspflicht hinausgeht.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"To be totally fair, about the only real thing the US currently exports is inflation. Every time the federal reserve creates inflation due to their monetary policy, it becomes apparent in the form of commodity prices (oil, food, gold etc).. while we try to maintain a EUR/USD rate between 1.30-1.40, we are vulnerable to inflation caused by the dollar. The only real solution is to publicly call out the US on this shit or start trading globally in other currencies, both of which will likely be considered an act of war by the US.

Right now it's more of a case of waiting for the US to screw themselves over economically, which they seem to be doing a very good job of without any help :)

Ask yourself, in this global economy we have now, do you honestly think  the US is **needed** for _anything_? oil? nope (just use the us dollar to buy it), computer chips? Last I checked a lot of the latest research for Intel's chips have been from Israel and I've only ever used chips made in asian countries. Everything else we need today we can get from all over the place, but for some reason still use the US Dollar to trade internationally.

Best case scenario for the future is that we start trading with a basket of currencies, and the US starts waking up and becoming competitive again in the market. Only this way can we start moving forward with true growth again. There is only so much benefit an economy can receive from companies like Facebook with high market valuations but no true output.

If it makes you feel any better.. I'd rather buy 100% Made in 'Murica products (even if they cost more), but it has become extremely rare to find such products nowerdays.

tl;dr: Can the US please start being productive again like they were in the past when they got shit done to create what we now know as ""western lifestyle"", instead of trying to make a cut on everything by not doing anything as they seem to have been doing in the last 10 years or so ? No way the global economy based on the US dollar is gonna return to true growth and jobs any time soon while the US economy is stagnated... stuff like Facebook should just be removed from GDP.. it doesn't create jobs... it's just a bunch of big numbers of theoretical money that theoretically won't be spent employing people.",0,1360017074,null,0,1360017717,0,c89d8ad,t3_17ve7j,t1_c89d8ad,t1_c89c211,null,1431184978,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Apparently at the very least a 0.25€ tax per GB will be applied. If I want to buy a 2TB hard drive (prices vary, usually 200€) to store the RAW files from pictures I take with my digital camera (~15mb each) I will have to pay *at least* an extra 512€. Almost 3 times the price of the actual item itself will be a single tax. I'm not even throwing sales taxes into the equation. This is beyond surreal when I'm not even interested in *anything at all* where they own copyright. Most of the ""music"" and ""literature"" made here is absolutely terrible as I'm sure pretty much every single portuguese can confirm.

The only reasoning I can find behind all this is they come up initially with totally outrageous numbers and from there on build a platform to negotiate and get *something* out of it instead of getting what they should, which is ZERO.

&gt; If I start with my hands in minecraft and end up with a castle I have created something, I didn't buy it or sell it to someone else, it suddenly exists.

It only exists because you have put the time in the creation. I'm not going to categorize that as a zero-sum because it depends on what you value more. If you value your castle more then the time lost working on it, then you have made a profit in let's say happiness, or wasting time productively, or bringing joy to your friends, or community.
But that is just how valuable somebody else finds your product. It's subjective.  Now what happens when the value of certain things drop, does the supply of money also drop, or does it stay the same? And even in the opposite direction if the value of something increases does the currency follow up with an inflation in the money supply?
And as a followup question in regards to the Greece issue. If Greece has received goods that have value, and in return has not paid for them, how could more money printing resolve the issue, if no value has been gained or lost in the respective Greek market?

The fact that these ""guys were not clean and were involved in some serious shit"" does not mean that they should not be treated based on the rule of law and having their full human rights respected. 

No matter how obvious you think their guilt is, this in now way gives the state the right to beat them or otherwise torture them. All these principles stem from the time of the Enlightenment, so it is very tiring for me to repeat them; they should go without saying. 

This has really dissolved into a ""he said - she said"" situation.

Right now, if Greece, Italy or Spain would have some grand scheme of how we should be doing things, not many will listen. If Germany has some ideas, they are likely to be heard. That is how it is right know and we can all agree that Germany has taken a lead here.

It is clear that UK consider it self to be among the leading nations in EU. They expect to be heard and that it will get opt outs etc. I find that delusional.

*Do some research and see if you can get an ""[Imagine R](http://www.imagine-r.com/)"" metro pass (meant for students, possibly Parisian schools only); maybe somebody here will know. If you can, get it. Not only is it the most economical pass for metro, you get certain discounts (that I still need to find out more about and make use of). AND you can use the same card for the Velib pass (see below).

*A year-long [Velib](http://en.velib.paris.fr/) (rent-a-bike) pass is only 29 euros for youth (14-26 y/o). With the pass you can take a bike out from any Velib station and pay nothing as long as you return it to one of the many Velib stations in Paris within 45min. If you need to travel further, just return the bike at any station and wait 2min to take another bike out. 

*Parisians can be rude. But don't take it personally, they are like that with everybody, even locals, as far as I can tell. It's a busy, cramped city, with a fast-pace of life so people can be impatient. It'll help if you speak the language, even just a little bit.

*All the museums have free entry every first Sunday of the month, and I believe the Louvre (maybe some other's as well) are free to all EU students all the time.

*I've heard international students can get funding for accommodations, take a look into whether interns are also eligible.

*Here are the places where I get my groceries, beginning from least expensive: Lidl, Monoprix, Marche Franprix. (I could be wrong and would love to hear what others have to say).

*Parisian tap water is perfectly safe to drink.

*The Eiffel tower twinkles every hour, at least when it's dark, and it sure is perdy.

*I've heard, not experienced myself, that the 18th, 19th, and 94th areas are the most dangerous (robberies, pickpockets), especially at night.

*If you don't already speak French, check out [memrise.com](http://www.memrise.com/home/), [franglish.com](http://www.franglish.eu/en/home), and download Rosetta stone.

*If haven't already looked into [this](http://www.embassyofireland.fr/home/index.aspx?id=30731), take a look. I also recommend taking a look at embassy websites of other English speaking countries (i.e. UK, US, Canada, etc)

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; I was suggesting that **since the Shoah was the greatest motivator for the artificial creation of Israel**

The assumption in bold is false. The greatest motivator for the creation of Israel was the idea of national self-determination that had driven contemporary Poles, Lithuanians, Estonians, Romanians, etc. to demand their own nation-state. The main body of Jews in Palestine were there before the Shoah, and more importantly, the institutions that would become the framework for State of Israel were already built before the Shoah even started. The Jewish Agency for Palestine, which would become the provisional government of Israel, was created in 1929. The Haganah, which would become the IDF, was created in 1920. The Histadrut, which would become the Israeli civil service, was also created in 1920. The Anglo-Palestine Bank, which would become the Israeli central bank, was founded in 1902.

You missed my main point. Jews aren't in Israel because of the Holocaust, and to suggest that betrays a wildly misinformed view of history.

The timeline is more like:

Ideas of national self-determination take hold in Europe, including among Jews -&gt; Jews migrate to Palestine and found Jewish institutions there -&gt; Jews declare a state.

The Shoah is tangential to the creation of the State of Israel. Obviously, it holds a significant place among Jews for being the single largest calamity to happen to the Jewish people in recorded history, obliterating entire civilizations and turning the most vibrant center of Jewish life literally into ashes, but it did not cause the State of Israel to come into being.

Nonsense.

What you mean our massive AAA rated economy?

&gt;That is how it is right know and we can all agree that Germany has taken a lead here.

Germany has the largest economy and population.

&gt;It is clear that UK consider it self to be among the leading nations in EU. They expect to be heard and that it will get opt outs etc. I find that delusional.

Ok. You're a little strange then. We are a part of the triumvirate.

I'm not sure what you mean by record, we have a strong economy, and what do you mean by reliable and supportive? Just because we don't consent to everything France and Germany put on the table put on the EU doesn't mean we're rebels. It's *our* EU too, we get to disagree with things.

We are in the EU. But just because we're in it doesn't mean we have to agree with every single thing that's decided by a few countries, or even the majority. It's an organisation in which there should be debate, dissent, and discussion.

For the cheapest supermarkets, go to Lidl, Dia, Franprix (NOT marché Franprix), or Champion/Carrefour.


Imagin'R is definitely a must-have, especially as a student with a job paying for it. Velib can be useful too.


Also, I'm almost 100% positive a foreign student is eligible for the APL (Aide Pour le Logement), a government fund to help you pay the rent. It ranges from 150€ to 400€ and depends mainly on how much you earn and the price of your rent. 


As for finding a place in Paris, just one advice : do NOT rent a place without a writtent contract. There's a huge black market of owners tricking students (especially foreign ones) into paying an insane amount of money for a moldy closet. Oh and if it's less than 9m², steer clear, they don't even have the right to rent it.


As for the dangerous areas, the 18th is not that bad overall. There's some gettho pockets inside of Paris but not that much. It's pretty much the same for the suburbs, but since it represents a way bigger area, the pockets are bigger too. Most places are alright, but in some the police won't go (at least by foot) anymore.

So if you can detour for a day or two, Valencia is okay. But if you come after visiting Barcelona, you might be disappointed, as it is a smaller city. However, if you want to try REAL paella, Valencia is the place (Paella is a valencian dish, I don't trust eating paella anywhere else!! :P I mean the good ones, not the frozen stuff you get in many tourist restaurants).

Barcelona is definitely amazing, especially La Sagrada Familia (go inside! worth every cent). Also, if you go to Sagrada Familia, get the tickets online!! The queue to get them right there is insane (hours long). 

Also when I've been there I visited a hotel in the center of Barcelona, a very expensive hotel that opens the rooftop from 6pm to the public. There is a bar there, and you can see all Barcelona from above. Really worth it, and it's free!. Unless you want to get something to drink of course, which I recommend.

While the civilized world gained internetaccess in the early 90s the german communications minister prevented germans from joining the internet. Instead a Datex-J and BTX were used...so no german had digital contact with foreigners to be able to reflect the own douchebaggery.
Currently the worst cases of germans-having-a-discussion is in places like SpiegelOnline Forum. While irony or a good rant is always seen as ""wrong german communication"" the vast majority of germans prefers to act up like assholes in online communication - as seen in the example of this thread.

It would also take every enjoyment out of driving. Cars would become boring moving boxes. 50 km/h is bad enough, but with the occasional 70m km/h zones or in the zones where you know there are no policemen and no cameras so you can drive faster there is still some amount of enjoyment in it.

I am really disturbed how people see it is a good idea. It is **culturally wrong** - already we are becoming a passive, sclerotic, sleepy, comfort-addicted continent. We need more ""buzz"", more energy, ambition, competition, more adrenaline, and it is precisely the wrong direction. Faster cars, even when it means more road deaths, would mean a more active, competitive, challenging, more masculine, higher-adrenaline culture. Currently we are too much moving towards a ""grandma culture"".

Another reason why it is retarded that it increases congestion while not rally solving anything. Kids cannot play football on a 30 km/h street any more than a 50 km/h street. It is not one bit more livable.  Somewhat safer, but pedestrians still cannot use the road.

What I would do is to convert many streets to pedestrian only (plus bikes), and in return find the main arteries of traffic, especially the places where noise is not a big issue, build pedestrian bridges or underway crossings, and with that 80 km/h speed limit. 

So like put cars in a small number of fast streets not a large number of slow ones.

**We should relearn the car as a cultural icon of a competitive, masculine, energetic, adrenaline culture, and stop hating on it.**

That water tastes quite nice.  
Meanwhile, the rest drinks processed Seine or Marne water. That's just as safe to drink but doesn't taste as good probably.

The reason for this is historical, when tap water was first installed it was done so in the central arrondissements first.

You really are quite a cunt. I do see the benefits of the EU, but that doesn't mean that I have to accept the entire thing without argument or debate. You're not talking about acceptance of decisions here, you're talking about just blindly going along with whatever is suggested.

It's written into the constitution and into many a law that countries can opt out of specific things, we use this ability some time. If the EU didn't want countries to have the ability to opt out of certain specific pieces of legislation then it shouldn't have, as not just a majority but unanimously, signed into law legislation which allowed this. The UK acts in perfect accordance with the laws and regulations of the EU, and in certain situations in a manner perfectly within its rights as laid out by commonly agreed upon EU law chooses to opt out of certain regulations.

I can see why they are doing it though, it just the politics of the campaign. Putting out a roadmap for independence early makes Independence seem like something real to the electorate rather than just a potential what-if and sets out a theoretically feasible path to Independence. As an opposite example of this politicking the UK government has been asked by the SNP to lodge a question with the EU commission about Scotland's position in the EU and in principle by the Electoral Commission to discuss the process of Scotland becoming Independent but they have refused because it would make it seem like they are taking independence seriously and the confusion over the EU only helps the No side. Cameron said he would not ""pre-negotiate Scotland's exit"".

I think if it comes to it it's possible that'll take a wee bit longer than this and that isn't automatically a bad thing. Better to take some time and get it right rather than rush.

true,cb43569,SCOT,Scottish Socialist Republic,"Scot here with the full intentions of voting yes. This has *nothing* to do with simple cultural differences, at least to me. I still feel like part of a shared ""British"" identity, although it's unfair to link that directly to the British state, because I have as much common ground with people from Ireland as with people from England. Like Irvine Welsh said: ""Swedes, Norwegians and Danes remain on amicable terms; they trade, co-operate and visit each other socially any time they like. They don't need a pompous, blustering state called Scandinavia, informing them from Stockholm how wonderful they all are, but (kind of) only really meaning Sweden.""

Politically, Scotland is very different from the UK as a whole. This is essentially acknowledged by the UK government through the very existence of devolution: the fact that we have a Scottish Parliament, and it has chosen to exercise power at odds with the British Government, should tell you everything you need to know about the state of politics here. The SNP isn't a single-policy party, either, they're a social democratic party, and possibly the last one to exist in the UK. The SNP's approval rate has barely changed since their landslide victory in 2011. The UK's Conservative Prime Minister is probably quite embarrassed that his party only has a single member of parliament from Scotland (that's 1 out of 59).

Then, parliament in the first place is a problem: Scotland has only 59 seats, meaning it's outnumbered by London alone with 73. How can any Scot feel that their vote matters when their concerns are largely ignored by Westminster? Before devolution at the turn of the millennium, Scottish issues were barely addressed. Even relatively simple Scottish developments like the Skye Bridge were turned into clusterfucks by the UK's government. It's been proven through devolution that Scotland is governed best by the people of Scotland, and independence is about completing the power of the Scottish Parliament so it can legislate in all areas. Practically, that means removing nuclear weapons from the Clyde (along with its [leaked nuclear waste](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/may/18/mod-nuclear-waste-submarines)), no longer taking part in foreign, interventionist wars, no longer demonising the poor and slashing benefits, and no longer being accountable to inherently undemocratic institutions like the House of Lords.",0,1360073819,null,0,false,0,c89q5vx,t3_17xebr,t1_c89q5vx,t1_c89paoz,null,1431198237,24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,24

I wrote above of how my father was beaten with a piece of folded garden hose as a child and he in turn as stories of even more brutal abuse from an earlier generation. The one thing they all have in common? No matter how vicious the abuse, the victims would make excuses for it, saying that they deserved it and that they are better people for it—even though there is quite literally not a single way which people of my generation would consensually agree that to be the case. 

There is not a single form of abuse, no matter how monstruous, that children will not rationalise if there is enough social pressure to do so—a perfect example are victims of genital mutilation. Talk to an American about how they feel about their mangled penises, for an interesting parallel.

The structure within the UK has always been that Scotland is ""different"". This is not obvious from the outside, but there are two legal systems, two governments, two national health services, two educational systems, etc.

They obviously overlap in many ways, but are also different in others. Taking an example of each:

* A criminal trial in England results in guilty/not guilty. In Scotland it can also result in ""not proven"".
* The Scottish government introduced a smoking ban a year before the rest of the UK.
* The controversial ""privatisation"" of the health service in England does not apply in Scotland.
* Schools sit a different set of exams, Universities typically offer 4 year courses not 3.

There are several cases where Scottish politics is quite clearly different from the UK as a whole.

E.g., Scotland is aiming to have 100% of electricity generated from renewables by 2020, and is currently at 35% (the UK target for 2020 is 15%). The UK's nuclear weapons are all stationed in Scotland, some 30 miles from Scotland's largest city.

http://11870.com/pro/el-tigre/map

For 2.5 euros you'll have a drink and a plate full of tapas. The place is usually crowded and sometimes even not allowing more people as it's full, but on wednesday I think you'll be fine.

* Also in the sourrandings of Plaza Mayor (which I recommend to visit) you have a typical bar called ""El Madroño"" which serves shots from a local liquor called by the same name which the curious thing you get to eat the glass after taking the shot.
