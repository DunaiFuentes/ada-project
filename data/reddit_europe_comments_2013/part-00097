Wer behauptet, dass in Deutschland kein Qualitätsjournalismus existiert, redet einfach Unsinn. Es gibt hier und da immer mal Ausnahmen und kleinere Verlage haben natürlich nicht die Mittel zu einer Berichterstattung der ""Zeit"", dieses Zeitungs-bashen ist aber völliger Wahnsinn.

Toll. Noch einfacher kann man sichs natürlich nicht machen. Diese Haltung ist schon relativ ignorant und selbstgefällig...

Anstatt dass diese Bloggerin ""rumheult"" sollte sie lieber mal erklären, wie sie die Finanzierung lösen würde, ohne dass das Unternehmen rote Zahlen schreibt. Aber das kann sie natürlich nicht, genau wie die meisten Anderen hier, die denken schlauer zu sein, als die gesamte deutsche Werbeindustrie / Marktstrategen der Verlage, usw...

I mean, it's understandable that Americans don't know much about Russia, but the problem is that people who don't understand something don't seem to be hindered in making judgments on the things they have not experienced or read about. Russia has far more ethnic diversity than the US as far as actual separate cultures speaking their separate languages on their homeland. US is a melting pot, but the end product is generally 'American' with some 'flavours' as I would say. 

I mean, people have 'heritage' and stuff, but it's really absurd, having seen it first hand. Anyone who was born here pretty much loses their European ethnic diversity, from the sons and daughters of Euro immigrants I have seen. Being Muslim, for instance, often provides a separate counter-identity that allows them to be different. But being a plain Euro rarely allows the person to retain actual separate identity. The US culture is very good at spreading and being attractive to people of all cultures. 

The issue is that the Russian population still makes up a high percentage of the general population - overwhelming in fact. So in that it is homogenous. But that depends on where you live. The problem is that to Americans or most Euros Russia is just one country with one people, which couldn't be farther from the truth, given its size. We also did not slaughter our natives, instead preferring to give them tributary status and leave them be, without even trying to convert them (it was voluntary) so that enabled Russia to preserve many of its cultures.

There is no doubt that the goal of the EU, as it was designed, and as it is functioning now, is to create a federal state. 

There is also no doubt that any leaders of France or Germary are going to be in favor of that, because the two leading political parties in those countries are pro-European. The national elites of those countries are pro-European. The only time they're against it, it's to win national elections. But once they're in business...

They might disagree on how to do that federal Europe, but they still see it at the end-goal.

Now we've seen both Merkel and Holland publicly say, that in the incoming years, the EU will be more federal and that states will lose a bit of their sovereignty in favor of European institutions. The peoples of Europe aren't ready for that quite yet, in fact they would be against it if it's explained to them. But here's the catch.

Since the economical situation of Europe will worsen, here is what will happen : when everything will look very dark and the future a gloomy perpetual recession, European head states will organize an exceptional summit and decide suddenly to change the way how to govern Europe. And behold! Europe will be saved. And without having any say into it, the peoples of Europe will have relinquished their national sovereignty.

Of course, there's still lot of uncertainty (what is the UK going to do in the incoming years, will there be massive strikes and or riots somewhere, will Greece hold, etc.) and a few unprobable events possible (an independent Scotland in the UK, the split of Belgium between Flandres and Wallonie, an authoritarian regime in Greece, or even international events such as an early Chinese collapse, etc.).",0,1368743083,null,0,false,0,ca07iz7,t3_1eghfd,t1_ca07iz7,t1_ca00hpf,null,1431133245,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt;De ILGA-kaart wordt samengestekld aan de hand van 24 criteria. Het opengestelde huwelijk is er één van. Volgens Joel Le Deroff, politiek adviseur van de ILGA, staat het Verenigd Koninkrijk aan kop omdat daar de meeste vooruitgang is geboekt als het gaat om genderidentiteit. Voorlichting op scholen is er verplicht en ambtenaren mogen geen onderscheid maken tussen hetero- en homoseksuelen.

&gt;Volgens de ILGA is in geen enkel land de homostrijd getreden. Nederland zou de weigerambteneren moeten verbieden, voorlichting op scholen moeten verplichten, scholieren en leerkrachten beter moeten beschermen en het homoseksueel ouderschap moeten gelijktrekken met de situatie van heteroseksuelen. Dat laatste punt staat binnenkort op de Kameragenda.

Translation summary: UK made the most progress i.t.o. gender-identity, including making education on this topic compulsory and eliminating any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation by civil servants.

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"Well, and I am a Russian, so yeah... I don't just know a lot of them, I lived there. You are Polish, so it's not bad, but not the same the same as living in Russia. You're not necessarily wrong though, to assume that homophobia equals racism. A lot of times the two things go hand in hand. :S

As far as people of different races, we have lots of people from Central Asia. I don't see anything even close to what I see here in the US with the blacks. I am sure we have enough of our racists, but I haven't seen them personally and I don't think they are a large percentage. Obviously, if we were put in the same situation as Americans are in it would be quite likely that a lot of Russians would become racists. But we aren't in the same situation.

Racism and homophobia are pretty different. Russians dislike homosexuality because they view it as unnatural, not because they are social conservatives necessarily. Of course, seeing homosexuality as unnatural *is* social conservatism in a nation like the US, but I have to explain to Americans that Russians are very alien people if they try to force their views on our culture. As a Pole you should probably have a better idea, but then again probably not considering that Poland has a lot of social conservatives who still favour Catholic values (correct me if I am wrong, I'm just repeating what *The Economist* said). 

In Russia things like abortion that are hot-button issues in the US aren't even discussed. Usually homophobia goes hand in hand with anti-abortion activism because both are born of religion. In the Russian context however, the homophobia is not religious at all. It's just being a close-minded dick. Religion still doesn't factor in much into our politics, although our arse-backwards Orthodox Church is doing its best to change that (and Putin is cozy with them, given their semi-secret dirty pact).

One thing we *really* need to get rid of is religious ethos in schools. This is mainly a consequence of the post-independence state not having the money to fund education or to support a functioning welfare state, so that responsibility fell on the churches.

Ero ancora alle superiori (a occhio in seconda), quando un giorno d'estate è passata una ragazza a casa mia. Mi proponeva la realizzazione di un annuario della mia annata, con tutti i miei compagni di classe delle elementari e medie (abito in un paesino piccolo, quindi è un progetto sensato). Io avevo in mente quegli annuari americani, con tanto di frase a effetto e foto stupida. M'ha chiesto 100.000lire da pagare in anticipo. Non le avevo, avevo solo 50.000lire in risparmi. Ha detto che come acconto andava bene, m'ha riempito una ""ricevuta"" senza intestazione, che valeva come scontrino per ritirare il prodotto al momento della consegna (quando finivo di pagare mi avrebbero dato una ricevuta vera e propria).

Ancora non avevo capito che era un truffa. Infatti chiamo alcuni dei miei amici e scopro che la maggior parte di loro non aveva accettato di partecipare. Ora, se pochi partecipano l'annuario succhia comunque, anche se fosse stato un progetto serio. A un certo punto parlo con un mio amico che mi dice che si tratta di un gruppo di stronze che si girano i paesini con questa scusa, che raccolgono solo acconti parziali così non devono rilasciare la ricevuta e che ovviamente non esiste nessun annuario.

Ho inseguito la stronza che era venuta da me fino alla sua prossima meta, in bicicletta e quando le ho detto che avevo avuto questa soffiata, m'ha detto che non poteva restituirmi i soldi che non poteva farci niente e che, se volevo, potevo denunciarla. Non sapevo come fare, visto che non mi voleva lasciare gli estremi e non avevo il cellulare (si parla del, uhm, 1996?) con cui chiamare la polizia. Lei era in macchina e s'è pure dileguata.
E niente, l'ho presa in culo.

Qualche settimana dopo, sul giornale, l'articolo: sgominata la ""banda dell'annuario"". Almeno le hanno prese, 'ste stronze.

Somehow I managed to get a loan from my credit union to finance it. I'm now 2 years into a Psychology degree and volunteering at a local mental health clinic while still collecting my dole every week. In other words, life is good and I'm keeping active and productive. Becoming semi-employed/unemployed was the best thing that ever happened to me in terms of my overall happiness. 

My finances are REALLY tough though, I've got real expenses due to my volunteering and my loan repayments so I had to sell my car and move back in with my parents at 27 years old.

true,talideon,CONN,Connacht,"We're not really as far behind the UK in those regards as those numbers would seem to say. I also thing you overestimate how religious older Irish people are: that generation started dying away 15 years ago.

It's important to keep in mind *why* the RCC became so powerful. Pre-independence, it was relatively strong because it had a lobby, but post-independence, they became all-powerful not because of demographic shifts or because people suddenly became more religious, but because there was a massive vacuum created.

Imagine that Scotland became independent next week, but rather than having all the assets and debts divided up fairly, the rump UK made it a requirement of the newly independent Scotland to buy itself back. You can imagine how that might impact a rather fragile newly-independent state. Well, that happened in Ireland after we became independent of the UK. Search for ""land annuities"" and ""Anglo-Irish Trade War"" for more information. Suffice it to say that all that meant that the state could not afford to fund education, health, welfare, and other social supports, and that vacuum was filled by the RCC, who largely took on responsibility for those aspects of the state, along with the power and control that came with it.

And I think we're all too well aware of the damage that's caused.

Since the '60s, the RCC has been on a decline, and it effectively lost the last of it's power in the early '90s. It has no power now. Sure, there are conservative lobby groups such as the Iona Institute who are given far more airtime than they warrant in the interests of 'fairness and balance', and we still have fuckwits like Youth Defence (effectively the Irish branch of SPUC) around, but we also have a Taoiseach (Prime Minister) who has effectively [told the RCC to go fuck themselves](http://www.thejournal.ie/kenny-condemns-the-dysfunction-and-disconnection-of-the-catholic-church-182356-Jul2011/) on several occasions since coming into office.

You guys are just a bunch of littles dicators, everyone should be free to express theirs points of views, out of being called racist because they just want to share the neighborhood with people of the same race.

People like to have neighbors that they know will have the same habits than themselves. When you have the choice to choose between, why is it racist ? You know what is racism? It would be to force people to go away because they are blacks, latinos, whites or whatever just because of this criteria.

And? Surprisingly life is pretty good. I can see how some people can live for years like that.

If you live in a shared house like me, where rent for a single room in £250 (shared house means you only rent a room, pay no bills, but other people live in other rooms) the Housing Benefit can cover 90% of the rent. On top of that you'd get £140 every fortnight from Jobseekers.

Assuming that you don't have much expenses £40 per week would suffice, and if you're very frugal even 20. 

I managed to save about £200 a month living on taxpayers expense, so if you don't mind  sharing a house with others, you will afford a nice vacation in Mediterranean in two months.

On top of that as Unemployed you can make some courses for free, so there's something to do with your free time.
Meeting with your advisor is a joke (A:-Hi, how's you jobsearch going? ME:-still nothing A:-okay. sign here and see you in two weeks).

So overall, the government should do something about that. It's too damn easy to live like that and there is plenty of people exploiting this, who don't really want a job.

Anstatt sich um das zu kümmern worum es ihnen gehen sollte, dem Spieler, bauten sie immer mehr Hürden ein, die nur dem ehrlichen Kunden schadete.

Ein anderes Beispiel sind die Musikverlage, die meiner Meinung nach ein archaischer Überbau sind. Sie sind obsolet und anstatt sich neu zu orientieren, andere Wege zu erschliessen und vorwärts zu schauen, schauen sie traurig zu, wie ihr Reichtum schwindet.

Und genauso geht es mir mit den Printmedien. Ja klar gibt es Webseiten. Aber da endet auch schon die Innovationsfähigkeit. Auch hier wird den guten alten Tagen mit soviel Enthusiasmus nachgeheult, der besser zur Ideenfindung benutzt werden kann.

And yet any Ami redditor - liberal, conservative, nationalist or even neutral - will invariably fling vitriol in my face, ranting about Euros always being judgemental and assuming things about the US without actually knowing a lot and first-hand. 

It's very frustrating. You cannot criticise any aspect of the US as a foreigner, period. Redditors will kill you without the slightest shred of mercy. So eventually I figured out that the trick was to not mention I was a Euro or Russia or foreign at all. And voila, everything changed.

I have no reason at all to believe that you would have reacted any differently if you by chance would have stumbled on something critical I posted about Americans. It seems that all American redditors are touchy about it, or at least the ones who take the time to reply to me and downvote me. Redditors who circlejerk about US being a bad guy and so on will turn in a second on a foreigner for making a critical post. Of course, I only visit threads like those to offer a dissenting opinion. So if I see circlejerk one way, I post something countering it. This gets me the most downvotes (on any topic) or the most upvotes. 

That's basically how I feel about this. It's total bullshit. If I came in like you and tried to categorise US without having lived there, I would be crucified. Even if I had a major in US history, the same goddamn redditors who are atheists would totally ignore facts in favour of their sentiments. I am an atheist too - not like being gay gives you a choice - and yet I don't think atheists are any different. Atheist redditors fall for the same traps they themselves will stone others for. Same goes for US redditors. If reddit was a Russian site, I don't doubt the same would hold true - but since we are speaking of our reddit here, we will focus on what our reddit embodies, and not the hypotheticals.

&gt; Forty per cent of Muslims between the ages of 16 and 24 said they would prefer to live under sharia law in Britain, a legal system based on the teachings of the Koran. The figure among over-55s, in contrast, was only 17 per cent.

The same attitude is also present when it comes to Islamic schools, killing apostates and so on. The figures hover at 15-20% for over 55s, but jumps to around 40% for 16-25 year olds (but this was taken in 2007 so those people would be 22-31 now).

This is very worrying. The survey was taken in 2007 so I'm hoping this was just a reaction against the Iraq war rather than a strongly held view.

It's a consciousness only they have. A Russian can 'catch' it, I suppose, but it's not a default amongst us. Russians are plenty hateful, but there is a certain 'racialist' mindset that you have to have. We don't have too many blacks outside of Moscow and we don't consider Asians to be different from us. Though the lack of distinction that Russians make between ourselves and Asians may be an indicator of a sort.

Sure, we have our Neo-Nazis too, but a regular person doesn't see Asians as any different.

- We are at a constant battle with the federal government over Internet and communications surveillance. Thankfully our highest court (which can render laws invalid) is pretty tired of the Orwellianism too.

- Our pension system is based on the fact that young people finance it while pensioners enjoy their retirement. This was great when there were plenty of young people around, but since the birth rate is stagnating or even sinking, this will lead to many old people in the future, but fewer young people. 

- The low birth rate also means there are fewer people to be trained for specialized jobs, like engineers or software developers, which are in dire need. There is still no sensible solution to this problem, but it's not for a lack of trying (Blue Card etc).

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"Yes, but the thing is that the 'worldly' view puts things into perspective. Russians who don't travel much are very similar to Americans who don't travel much. Both exhibit similar patterns of thought in relation to this issue - the excessive emphasis being placed on small differences. The differences do matter, you are correct of course. But if your threshold for those said 'differences' is so minute, then almost every country is wildly diverse by that marker. 

Yep, the latter point is the truest one you have made so far. American cities are indeed more mixed and you are indeed more likely to interact with other people. That is very much true. 

But why do Americans seem so strangely insular then? I have never met a developed nation as insular as the US. The rest of the world hardly seems to matter whenever I am spending time in the US. It's like a magical land, not really a part of the globe. People back home often regularly cross borders and clash with *actual* different cultures, ones that speak different languages and aren't assimilated at all. Ones that do not assume a sort of a 'submissive' stance of accommodation that immigrants are more likely to pull off than tourists or other international travellers. People back home are acutely aware of other nations and what it's like to be of a different nationality. People in the US ask me the dumbest questions possibly on a daily basis, ones that stun me with their naivete. My favourite one so far? That foreigners think in their own language.

You don't get this in Russia. This isn't people being smarter or dumber. It's a result of the US being a superpower surrounded by two oceans. The American culture is so dominant that there is no heavy exposure that Americans receive of truly independent foreign cultures. It's interesting to note that from a perspective of someone who majored in the study of the Antiquity, the Romans were described by Greeks almost *exactly* as I describe the Americans. Almost every stereotype is similar. But the point about Americans/Romans being the dominant culture is the strongest one. Which actually applied to the Greeks themselves too. Persons who were the products of the Greco-Roman culture often lacked that intrinsic understanding of things being done many different ways in various lands that other 'lesser' cultures were painfully aware of.

Extended analysis:

&gt;In fact, even babies have a distinct preference for faces of their own ethnic background. This has been extended beyond just African and Caucasian faces. This effect is not observed in newborns, but it is in three-month-olds. The reason for this makes sense. We have a cognitive bias called the mere-exposure effect
&gt;which makes us like things just because we've seen them before. Babies are mostly exposed to people of their own ethnic backgrounds, so they start to prefer them.
&gt;
&gt;An analogous effect can be observed in adults using implicit attitude tests. By measuring differences in reactions times associating different groups with positive vs negative vs neutral words, you can see that your brain is faster at associating certain groups with certain emotions because there are stronger connections between those groups and those feelings.
&gt;
&gt;This effect is measurable in perfectly nice, non-bigoted people. Even black people have been found to have an implicit negative attitude toward black people due to societal conditioning.
&gt;Here's a link to a bunch of implicit attitude tests if you're interested: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/demo/selectatest.html
&gt;
&gt;The point of all this is that our evolutionary history has biased us to favor those who are similar to us. It helped us form cohesive social units. Human cultural evolution with cities, states, countries, etc. has advanced much more quickly than our biology. Therefore we need to use culture to overcome our own inherent prejudice.
&gt;So in a way it's kind of depressing, but only by recognizing the problem can we hope to solve it.
&gt;
&gt;The initial racial preference causes you to only surround yourself with people of your own ethnicity so you never interact with different people. If you never interact with them then it's much harder to empathize with them and much easier to believe that they are inferior. There's a tendency to think of them as 'other' and therefore 'not-human' aka a racist ideology. When you view people as 'other' then you don't feel bad when you do things that harm them in order to help yourself.",0,1368770695,null,0,false,0,ca0gadr,t3_1egogk,t1_ca0gadr,t1_ca0g39m,null,1431129044,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Our schooling system does fail to promote students with low or little education background. Tho it would be wrong to blame it on the schools alone, society has a part in it, as do media etc.
Best prove of that is, that out of all the chancellors we had, only two (if I recall correctly) had a workingclass background (Schröder was the last one).

As a law student I have to correct you on your second point. The federal constitutional court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) is in fact not tired of the orwellian tendencies of our government. That would be political interest, and as you know, we follow a system of Gewaltenteilung (seperation of powers) - so no law giving power may execute those laws or sadminister justice. The Bundesverfassungsgericht only follows the constitution and deems law unconstitutional if they are. No politics at all, even tho our media tends to make it look like it. But don't get me started on media coverage of our legal system.

Trains are in fact on time... germans only whine about it, cause they have a plowing high standard and in fact like to whine a lot.
And personally that would be the one point I see as being most wrong in Germany. A lack of inovation and will to move on.
You can see it when it comes to the internet - mp3 was the last big contribution Germany made. Our connection speed is a joke compared to countries like Sweden, Denmark, the US and probably China, Japan, Korea, the UK, Canada, and many more.

You can see it in projects like Stuttgart 21 or the Femern Belt Crossing, which by the way is paid for by Denmark - Germany only has to build tracks to the tunnel to complete the connection.

You can see it in the weird, selfloathing way we handle our past and national identity - I don't think we should forget what has happened, but we shouldn't blame ourselfs on it, rather should make certain it does never happen again. And luckily we do seem to develop a national identity in the wake of World Cup 2006. Tho I'd rather have a mixture of pride on cultural, sport and engineering achievments, than football only achievments as basis for our national identity.

And you can see it in how our supposed change from nuclear energy to more enviromental friendly energy sources is a process of about 15 years in the making. (Starting under Schröder / Fischer, being stoped by Merkel only to be reanimated by her after Fukushima).

All those examples dont exactly show a nation of decissionmaking or experimental spirit. They show a nation of bureaucrats and people following strict codes.
I don't say that following codes is wrong in it's essence, it certainly helped us out in the current situation in Europe, but it also might have had its part in Germany seeing two totalitarian regimes in just 50 years.

So basicly my point is: pinpointing one or two problems doesn't do Germanys, or any problem the World might face, justice. Problems are mostly a connection of different topics, a complex, like a ball of yarn. Pulling on a string at one point of that complex might allow you to see a little more of the string, but you sure as hell tie a lot of new knots at ends you don't even see.

In tutto ci avrò rimesso 400 euro.

&gt; How can you say you've constantly been stimulating the economy when austerity is the opposite of a stimulus?

Economies are large. You can cut in one place and invest in another. In our case, smaller cuts have been made into areas like unemployment benefits, but the primary source of surplus resources are from increasing efficiency with structural reforms (including digitalisation). The main areas of investment have been education and infrastructure — colloquially, we say that when the times are bad, it's time to build another bridge…

Increasing inflation has, however, *not* been a key tool historically. The Danish krone, for example, has been pegged to larger currencies (first the D-mark, now the Euro) for decades.

&gt; I said something like ""you can't keep on borrowing forever without paying back"" and you said ""we've been doing that for 80 years while sometimes stopping so that we could pay our loans back"" - so you're just giving me reason.

We've taken loans, then paid them back with the results of the investment. I mean, it's not exactly an unusual way to go about things, is it? You're arguing against stimulus in general, asserting that all stimulus entails eternal debt, which isn't true. The problem comes, of course, when investments don't pay off, but infrastructure and education almost always do — provided everyone isn't corrupt.",0,1368777189,null,0,false,0,ca0hh76,t3_1eg4z6,t1_ca0hh76,t1_ca07z99,null,1431128414,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Bull... location and expectation make a huge difference just like anywhere in the world. German houses are not less affordable than in other countries. With the interest rates right now they are cheaper to finance than ever!

&gt; child allowances are pathetic


Other countries flat out don't have them. I certainly didn't get any for my children while I was in the US. Now the state pays me almost 200 Euro per child per month. At the current exchange rate that is nearly $260 US.

On n'a pas à ce jour de méthode pour déterminer si un dirigeant est bon ou pas, à part lui donner les rênes d'un groupe et voir les résultats au long terme. Du coup, quelqu'un qui a une expérience positive est considéré comme probablement un bon chef et peut vendre très chez cette expérience. J'ai par ailleurs des doutes en la matière. Je me demande s'il existe vraiment une corrélation entre le salaire d'embauche du CEO et ses résultats. Si tu as des données là dessus, je suis preneur. Car des patrons très bien payés pour mettre une boite en faillite, il y en a, et pas qu'un peu.

Un des corollaires de cette situation est que beaucoup de bons chefs d'entreprise potentiels existent mais ne peuvent pas faire leur preuve, car on ne souhaite pas prendre un risque (que par ailleurs personne ne sait quantifier) avec quelqu'un qui n'a pas d'expérience.

Personnellement, je soupçonne que si tous ces ""bon"" patrons qui considèrent qu'un salaire décent commence au dessus de quelques millions par an, quittaient la France, on serait forcé de donner naissance à une nouvelle génération de dirigeants que les boite étrangères s'arracheront dans 20 ans.

&gt; Les gros salaires sont une nécessité

Non. Les gros salaires dont on parle ne sont utiles que pour garder un certain type de profil psychologique, qui considère qu'il est légitime de gagner plus que 100x plus que le salaire minimum dans son entreprise. Que le résultat des lois de l'offre et la demande équivalent au mérite. Je n'arrive vraiment pas à me convaincre que la France perdrait quelque chose sans ces profils là, et *a fortiori* parmi ses élites.

But, come to think of it, yes. I would actually advocate for it. I did not, but now I do.

The primary reason is that social mobility works two ways, if we have lots of plumber sons going doctor, we will also have lots of doctor sons going plumber. And that is entirely unacceptable - to have a sheltered, delicate, fragile classy person subjected to the rough, bullying, brutal culture of working class people. I oppose compulsory military service for the same reason - you put a lawyers son into the same company as the plumbers son, and the later will bully and torture the living hell of the former.

Social mobility upwards is also problematic, but that is more acceptable as needed. First of all it reduces entrepreneurship. The plumbers son if he is clever, could either be a lawyer or a plumber who starts his own business and makes a large company, because he is clever. If we have no clever working class people because every clever person goes to university, who will start these types of businesses? If no clever person goes to a simple cook school because all go to uni, then most likely no clever person will open restaurants. That is bad.

Finally, there is the problem that the university cannot teach everything. Higher class people bring certain things from home. For example, working class people often fear bosses, fear people in suits. For higher class people the CFO is not that scary - dad or mom is a CFO too.

Les accords qu'ils passent ne sont que rarement compatibles avec les lois de copyright des autres pays. C'est en tout cas ce que m'avait expliqué une charmante personne chez Arte à qui j'avais posé la question.

Le documentaire était vraiment très bon. Je trouve vraiment qu'Arte fait des merveilles depuis 3 - 4 ans. C'est devenu beaucoup plus accessible, tout en restant pertinent. Ils se mettent même à proposer des séries européennes d'excellente facture (e.g. The Killing). Ils soignent de plus en plus leur image, passant doucement de la chaîne soporifique qui diffuse des opéras à un truc un peu punk, ou en tout cas résolument moderne. Il n'y a qu'à voir leur site web, qui est probablement le plus poussé de toutes les chaînes avec celui de Canal+, dont les moyens sont colossaux.

true,grumbelbart2,,Südfranken (München),"&gt; The Bundesverfassungsgericht only follows the constitution and deems law unconstitutional if they are. No politics at all, even tho our media tends to make it look like it. But don't get me started on media coverage of our legal system.

Yes and no. The Bundesverfassungsgericht does more than just saying ""is / is not unconstitutional"". They are much more specific, going into the details and saying, for example, ""this surveillence would be legal if you would restrict it to those kind of crimes"". While this is not direct politic, of course, their proposed changes are often implemented by the law maker.

Additionally, many decisions are based on balancing contradicting rights, which is what, for example, the whole ""secirity vs. freedom"" debate is all about. Meaning that there both sides sometimes have valid, legal arguments. Many ""fundamental rights"" have been eroded this way; for example, it is for some crimes now allowed to place bugs into peoples homes. How you balance those rights, i.e., where you draw the line, is thus not strictly following law but rather an opinion, and thus politics. Are bugs in homes allowed for murderers? rapists? child molesters? potential murderers? ""terrorists""? Alleged members of the mafia who might or might not commit a crime? Thiefs who stole billions? millions? thousands? My point is: The Bundesverfassungsgericht is doing politics by deciding where those lines are.

C'est marrant, c'est exactement le genre de scénario qui créent du charlatanisme.  ""T'as un puit à creuser, c'est un investissement lourd, en fonction de l'endroit ça a 20% de chance de foirer.

Je pense que je fais pour le patron comme pour n'importe quel employé : entretien, tests, période d'essai et en effet, expériences passées. Simplement, quelqu'un qui demande un très haut salaire alors qu'il sait la boite en faillite, je considérerais qu'il part très très mal.

&gt; Ouai effectivement. Mais avant ça est-ce que les conseil d'administrations qui cherche des dirigeants compétents ne choisiraient pas tout simplement de quitter la France? Ou bien pire, de tout payer au black...

Payer au black ? Un PDG ? Eh bien c'est un délit financier et dans ces cas là je pense que c'est passible de prison. 

Quitter la France ? Mais comment tu fais quand tu es une entreprise Française, avec son siège en France, ses usines en France, ses employés en France, ses clients en France ? Mine de rien, délocaliser les gens, ça marche assez mal. Je pense que si un CA se dit ""bon, on peut soit quitter la France à grands frais pour payer M.X qui demande un salaire énorme, soit rester en France pour zéro euros et embaucher M.Y qui demande un salaire décent"" et décide quand même de prendre X, y a un petit problème...

&gt; Très franchement OUI.

Eh ben on a des opinions opposées et je pense qu'aucune étude objective n'existe pour départager ces opinions donc on va devoir en rester là.

Once Islam gains critical mass in European soil, and it already has the momentum, we won't be able to stop it from tearing western civilization apart. Not without Europeans willing to lower themselves to their low values and fight it. But once they do we'll lose faster even because they have the numbers, motivation, support and they will hit us from all sides.

Islam is that a different kind of enemy. There is no such thing as a moderate Islam and no moderate Muslim. It's a dangerous idea and a way of life in itself, complete with politics, education, moral code, financial and even fashion. It will be far worse than anything else we've experienced and a return to barbarism.

I know there are certain problems because my wife is an elementary school teacher at a school with 97% immigrants.
One of the main problems in my opinion is that young Turkish males and females (most of them have German passports) don't feel like they have a homecountry. In Germany they are the ""Turks"" and in Turkey they are ""Germans"".

Tuttavia:

1) gli scienziati, se saranno condannati, lo saranno per la farsa, non per aver toppato la previsione dei terremoti. Una previsione di una scossa di magnitudo 5.9 o superiore tra il 1995 e il 2015 _non implica assolutamente_ che dopo 6 mesi di sciame sismico nel 2009 ci sarebbe stata una scossa di magnitudo 5.9 o superiore.  Altrimenti, perche' dopo 6 mesi e non dopo 2?  Mi risulta che a l'Aquila d'inverno faccia piuttosto freddo, cosa fai, organizzi una tendopoli a dicembre e evacui qualche decina di migliaia di persone? E per quanto tempo? In Calabria uno sciame sismico sta andando avanti se non sbaglio da 2-3 anni.

2) Questa condanna e' dovuta al fatto che a l'Aquila ci sono scosse di terremoto di quell'intensita' una volta ogni 2-300 anni, e quindi bisogna rispettare determinati criteri nella costruzione delle abitazioni. La cosa e' sacrosanta, ma del tutto indipendente dal fatto che la riunione fosse stata o meno una farsa. Stiamo parlando di un lasso di tempo diversi ordini di grandezza superiore rispetto alla durata dello sciame sismico, e anche superiore rispetto a quello della previsione di Boschi.

Capisco la voglia di incazzarsi con qualcuno, ma perche' linciare gli scienziati e non gli ingegneri che si sono prestati a costruire le case con la sabbia? E poi la Pezzopane e' pure finita in Parlamento, con l'unico merito di esser stata presidente di una provincia terremotata.

E gia' mi immagino lo stesso fatalismo quando il Vesuvio avra' la prossima eruzione.

Il fatto e' che in nessun altro paese sviluppato si muore per una scossa del genere. In Giappone manco si parla di sciami sismici, perche' sono all'ordine del giorno. Ci sono stato l'anno scorso e c'e' stata una scossa di 6.7 mentre ero li'. Ero al 14esimo piano e tutto quel che ho pensato era che i vicini di stanza stessero facendo cose sconce.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Eh it is not as peachy as it sounds. Most motorways of Europe have 2 lanes and the slow lane is full of slow trucks. That means that when you keep going in the fast lane, because there is no point in going back when you meet a truck every 30 seconds, and there are other cars stuck between the trucks. So it is a  game of chicken: ""Will he come out from behind the truck and cut in front of me at 110 km/h while I am driving 160, which means a dangerous slam on the brakes, especially in winter?"" So to chicken the other driver to stay behind the truck, you go even faster. Maybe he gets the message. But sometimes he does not look in the mirror or chickens you back by coming out and forcing you to slam the brakes. In a dry road it is survivable, with some burn tires and the ABS knocking, but in winter, on icy road, guaranteed accident.

And this happens in every km so even a 100km driving can be really stressful, always chickening each other. 

Of course it depends on the traffic, highest on the guest worker highway, when Romanians, Hungarians, Serbs, Slovaks, and most importantly many, many Turks working in Austria, Germany go home. Like we, for example, we are Hungarians working in Austria.

So to make the 380 km, 240 miles trip to visit family from Vienna to Eger, Friday afternoons in full guest worker traffic, makes me totally stressed out, shaking, because we have have at least 3-4 brake slams because of the other driver chickened us back and cut in front of us with 50 km/h speed difference, his being lower, in fact these days I don't even drive that distance fully, we sleep in the middle in Budapest. Because the guest worker traffic is always so that people drive home in Friday evenings, eastwards, and Sunday evenings back to work, westwards, so if I drive the rest of route on a Saturday morning then the motorway is almost empty.

Message to folks with Turkish licence plates: yeah, I know, you have a much longer drive until you see your family home. But it is no reason to kill both of us. Just stay behind that fucking truck - or do as others do and keep passing in the fast lane.

This is why France gets frustrated with it, Germany too but to a lesser extent and is more willing to accommodate Britain; I think a good example of this was when Merkel had Cameron visit her in her country residence a couple months back to hear his grievances.

I too would like Britain to be closer to Europe, however there are political (parliamentary sovereignty etc) and economical factors (Biggest financial center in Europe) that prevent it from being able to do that as easily as other countries on the continent. The biggest one at the minute I'd say is the democratic deficit, which turns a lot of people off on the EU (Though I feel this is an issue that is felt across Europe). 

I also think that there has been a lack of effort by the political parties to 'sell' Europe to the average Brit. I said in another thread that I found out my dad voted for UKIP in the last European election, not because he wanted independence from Europe but because ""None of the big three parties told me why we should be there, they assumed I should know"". This, against an anti EU media and a very vocal UKIP helps me understand why there is such resentment to the EU amongst the average Brit. They just don't hear about what's good, not convincingly.

As such, it does not make any direct contribution to the EU budget, but does provide between 1-2 billion Swiss francs to countries that joined the EU in 2004, this goes straight to those countries on development projects, rather than Brussels. The Bilateral agreement is what most Euro-sceptics dream of, but most probably would be the hardest to obtain (Swiss got a good deal, the EU probably wouldn't want to let a much bigger country like Britain get away with it). Switzerland is still subject to EU regulation (as you would be in bilateral trade deal), but can technically reject regulation, though it never has (or nearly never, not too sure on that). Also if we were to join the EEA I would expect our contribution to fall, we would not have to contribute to the CAP, nor would we be regulated by it.

I was talking about a straight split in my first post as I can't predict what will happen if Britain were to leave, to make all that effort to leave only then to become a member of the EEA;  making contributions, being subject to less (but still substantial) regulation and having much less influence over said regulation, wouldn't be desirable, in fact it would be a much worse position for those arguing we should leave. 

I think those that argue Britain could get a Swiss deal because we're too important to the EU for them to let us walk away are overplaying Britain's position (UKIP have argued this).

I think the more realistic answer is that he's trying to calm fears in the EU. My big criticism of the British EU debate at the moment is that it's unsettling businesses at the time we really need a solid secure environment for them. I approach it from a British perspective; that if we're threatening to leave the EU, a business that wants to trade with the EU will likely be tempted to set up in another EU country and not the UK.

But from an EU perspective, with one of the biggest members threatening to leave, business might fear that a mass breakup of the EU could happen or that Euroskeptics in other countries might take the situation in Britain and start demanding referendums in their countries.

Hollande is, I imagine, trying to calm people down and assure them that the EU is here to stay with or without Britain. Plus there's the German elections coming up soon which adds more uncertainty; the EU is a shaky place at the moment. After the German elections more will be sorted, I imagine, but for now it's left to Hollande as the only ""secure"" (i.e. not facing a backbench rebellion/election) leader of the ""big 3"" to calm everyone down.

Nel senso, sono sia d'accordo con coloro che dicono che la scuola deve soprattutto insegnare a pensare e ad imparare con metodo, ma sono anche d'accordo col fatto che vadano insegnate le basi scarne dell'ordinamento dello Stato (e per me, anche della UE)ai ragazzini.
Per me é fondamentale come il codice base della strada.
E no, non c'é bisogno di far politica per farlo. Basta dire quali sono le istituzioni e cosa fanno.

Le valutazioni sulla bonta dell'operato le faranno da grandi,ma sarebbe ottimo che iniziassero a sapere come funziona il Paese in cui vivono, almeno i meccanismi di base.

Perché che ""queste cose gliele insegnino i genitori"", mi sembra una beata ingenuitá, e anche ingiusto per chi ha genitori che non sono in grado di dargli queste nozioni.

A pag. 7 c'è la tabella interessante (tra l'altro se ci fai caso la probabilità di scossa era pari a 1 in 5, 20 e 100 anni). Per quanto riguarda gli ingegneri, sappi che ci sono processi in atto per i vari crolli e sono arrivate anche delle condanne, ma c'è anche da dire che negli anni Settanta il territorio aquilano fu ""retrocesso"" nella classificazione di sismicità, quindi molte case costruite secondo le normative hanno comunque subito danni ingenti.
Forse mi sono espresso male nel precedente post, comunque sono convinto anch'io che saranno condannati per essersi prestati alla farsa, ma se non si può prevedere un terremoto come si può dire **per certo** che non avverrà?  
Un po' di allarmismo non avrebbe fatto male a nessuno, anzi: considerato che mancavano pochi giorni alle vacanze di Pasqua si sarebbero potute chiudere in via preventiva tutte le scuole e le sedi dell'università per effettuare controlli approfonditi, si sarebbero potute approntare tendopoli in cui la gente che non si sentiva sicura sarebbe potuta andare a dormire (quasi tutti i giorni prima del terremoto dormivano con un borsone accanto alla porta), si sarebbero potute approntare strutture per la gestione dell'emergenza. Ho usato il condizionale perchè nulla di tutto ciò è stato fatto, perchè alla città è stato detto:""State tranquilli, è tutto normale."" Ognuno ha diritto alle sue opinioni, ma la condanna secondo me è sacrosanta.

For Britain, the winning government assuming power has enjoyed relatively more power than those in Europe, there is little separation of powers and the First past the post system usually ensures that the winning party gets a majority (This Con-Lib Coalition is an exception). 

This means that Britain is less used to power sharing than most European Countries, other European countries are willing to cede power to the EU it's normal for them to share, Britain is more protective of it, it finds it hard to give power to an institution that has a democratic deficit because the tradition of parliamentary sovereignty is eroded. A tradition that is a point of pride for Brits and the political class because it has lasted for centuries (Where Europe has had governments and systems change much more drastically due to historical reasons).

The turnout for the UK in the 2009 European Election was as low as 34% of the Electorate and 54% isn't a great figure, these are symptoms of a democratic deficit, people don't have faith that their vote makes a difference, if they believe a difference could be made, they'd vote.  But I do agree with your point on individual countries having an important say on EU policy. 

For me, I've always seen it as, you elect your leader, your leader represents you in the EU, because ultimately it's the EU country leaders which dictate EU policy and direction, so there is still a democratic line of sorts. I do think there should be more democracy within the Union.

true,trolls_brigade,EURO,European Union,"""Add a tax."" It's such an innocent and simple proposition. How difficult can it be? 

Every once in a while I have customers asking me to implement a small change to a big system, a change which could be summarized in 2 or 3 words. After that I told them the change is going to cost one million and take one year to implement. Usually their reaction is: ""What? There are only 3 words. It can't take more than a weekend and that is generous.""

So, to add this new tax you need at the very least, in each bank: 

- a new compliance desk and counsel
- a new accounting office
- developers to upgrade all the legacy systems to record the transactions, with all the risks of new bugs and downtime involved 
- audit mechanisms in place
- a tax collection process
- updates to the tax code
- changes to the software packages which calculate individual and corporate taxes
- and likely many others

At the end of the day, it would cost the banks more to implement than what the government receives.


Which brings me to this not so innocent question:

Why add new taxes when you can't collect even the old ones properly?

If commutes become too long, people would concentrate nearer to their workplace, thus making the countryside carrying less people. More urbanisation makes public transport more feasible (right now, in rural parts, public transport would be 1:45h from my home to my workplace, with a car it's about 40 minutes). Less cars means less need to build more roads.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Has it occurred to you that the combination is what does the trick?

Plenty of countries have done the reforms without the stimulus and turned out great.

Stimulus only serve to delay the problems into the future, it's spend now and tax later (in case of fiscal policy) or experience inflation later (in case of monetary policy) - that's no trick at all, that's not how you experience growth in any longer period of time.

&gt;You can cut in one place and invest in another. In our case, smaller cuts have been made into areas like unemployment benefits, but the primary source of surplus resources are from increasing efficiency with structural reforms (including digitalisation).

Not Keynesianism.

&gt;Increasing inflation has, however, not been a key tool historically. The Danish krone, for example, has been pegged to larger currencies (first the D-mark, now the Euro) for decades.

Not Keynesianism. We did plenty of that in order to stimulate the economy, and you can look up our inflation rates to see how bad it got, we got to a peak of &gt;50% inflation/year and from 1974 to 1984 it averaged 25%/year, only when we were forced to stop that to join the Euro did our inflation come tumbling down, only after 1995 did we start experiencing inflation rates below 5%..

So don't tell me you've experiencing Keynesianism because while you certainly have tried to stabilise your economy in downturns, you've paid back what you owe in the upturns, it was never constant stimulus, if you want to know what permanent stimulus looks like, look at our economy from 1974 till 1995 (both in terms of fiscal and monetary policy) or at our economy from 1974 till 2011 (in terms of fiscal policy).

&gt;We've taken loans, then paid them back with the results of the investment. I mean, it's not exactly an unusual way to go about things, is it?

Not Keynesianism, not ""we can constantly go into deficit spending"".

&gt;You're arguing against stimulus in general, asserting that all stimulus entails eternal debt, which isn't true.

I'm arguing against constant stimulus, I'm arguing for example at permanent expansionary fiscal policies (ending up with over 100% of public debt in terms of GDP and continuing to rise) and at permanent monetary stimulus (there have been over 500 decreases in the interest rates set by Central Banks all over the world since 2008).

&gt;The problem comes, of course, when investments don't pay off, but infrastructure and education almost always do — provided everyone isn't corrupt.

With regards to infrastructure, no, it doesn't, we're the 2nd OECD country with the most roads per square km (only behind Luxembourg) and what a waste, you can go 30min in one of those roads and not meet a single car, this even during broad daylight, no wonder these bullshit investments will never pay off, we built so many roads leading to nowhere and now it's time to pay back and it hurts. Same thing with the TGV, all the bridges, yet another highway between Porto and Lisbon.. I do can tell you it's been a great mistake to spend all this money and not letting private individuals being the ones to spend it and invest it!!

I have posted on /r/germany because I know that he went to university in Dusseldorf and have reason to believe he lives there now.

My Mum’s father was an Austrian called Manfred Weibold who came to England in the 1960s where he met my Grandma, but he had to leave for some unknown reason. She has never met him, but she has always been curious and is obsessed with TV programmes about genealogy and ancestors-which I think is a kind of indirect expression of her desire to discover her roots.

All I have is the picture and an article that suggests he was still living there in 2010. This relevant part of the article I have google translated: 

‘It is very bad in the amount of house numbers 230-260. ""When the cars pass by, shaking the whole house,"" says Manfred Weibold residents. ""So much so that the TV screen is blurred and the sound is interrupted. After 25 years, I had been so used to the trams that I have not heard. But now it feels like as if thunder directly through the apartment with us.’

Is there any kind of phonebook or German citizen register I could refer to? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated and I know this would mean the world to my Mum.

I'm saying that the CAP was of course supported by France, and it serve well France interest, but CAP is also supported by other agricultural country, and it was created to assure continental independance when it come to food.


I'm just saying that it is not as simple as ""The french tried to protect their inefficient farmers, and they are fucking all Europe"". It is more ""European countries were worried by their lack of control over food production, agricultural countries (and France was and still is the first of them) wanted to protect their interests so they negociated special rules"".
That's the way EU work (yeah, every country try to protect his farmer/plumber/factory/...). You're talking about wine, again, it is not a French only thing, it is a complex equilibrium, winemaking is not a french-only thing.

What you are saying about French european politic can actually be said for almost every country in the EU (UK rebate, ...) and the CAP is gradually becoming less and less important. 


Ironically, your comment about the lack of funding for research sound like Holland call for investment in EU to overcome the crisis (And I do not really agree with this :-) ).

Thanks for clearing that up, then what actually does EFTA membership bring?

&gt; Switzerland is still subject to EU regulation (as you would be in bilateral trade deal), but can technically reject regulation, though it never has (or nearly never, not too sure on that).

In my understanding that if Switzerland wanted to do something that was never to be exported to an EU country, then yes, it could do its own thing. An example, I guess would be something like unpasteurised cheese. 

&gt;Also if we were to join the EEA I would expect our contribution to fall, we would not have to contribute to the CAP, nor would we be regulated by it.

Definitely but the UK would still have to provide some subsidies, for example, for hill farmers but that would be much cheaper than supporting the French.

My own issue is that similar to the small-print of Scottish Independence, somebody needs to spend a lot of time looking at the small print and examine their impact on various scenarios. It does appear to me that these are actually linked. If UKIP force through an EU exit, I can see Scotland wanting to leave the UK and wanting to join the EU.

I suppose it saves hassle for countries like Norway and Switzerland in regards to trading between them. And a quick google suggests that to be a part of the EEA you have to either be a part of EFTA or the EU, so it can determine somewhat who can join the EEA if they don't want full EU membership. It also has secured trade deals globally.

CAP= food independance, in a Cold War context it is important. CAP = huge increase in food production.


CAP is now a very bad thing, yes. CAP now = inefficient, huge loss for foreign farmer (potatoes exported to... Africa because the stock are too hight,...), very costly, no more cold war context.


But look at the CAP budget, it's lowering. This is a good thing. France does fight for a slower diminution of this budget, but every french politician knows that it is no more the 60's. 


Look at the fact : What is the european fight of France today ? Tobin taxe, investment programm at an european level and no more harsh austerity.


You're saying that this is hypocritical, and Holland just want German money ?
Look a the last big invesment plan of the french government : investment in very hight speed internet and mobile internet, in education, in transport infrastructure. This is what he want on an european level. This can be wrong, but Holland truly believe in this.


Of course France is a aging country with agricultural roots and huge agrobusinesses, of course some politician will defend CAP against everything, but CAP is not a french only thing and french european policy is not CAP.

There was actually a Baltic Free Trade Area as well (confusingly named BAFTA) but that went with EU accession by the Baltic states.

If the necessary agreements cannot be quickly concluded then the worst case would be that individuals will have to take the slow route through immigration in EU countries and may even be subject to visas.

The big thing is that should the UK leave the EU, it has no trade agreements of its own. EFTA has a few with more under negotiation (but some significant absences like India). To essentially have to start the negotiations would be a massive piece of work, and these days our civil service is somewhat downsized so to conclude the initial ten or twenty most important trade agreements would take how long?

(A shrinking population is not a problem per se, but it does usually mean a decline in power and causes trouble in some of the German welfare systems, since they are based on the principle that the young, working population pays for the old folks.)

The ""Euro crisis"" might or might not be a huge problem for Germany, it's impossible to tell. Not much of a problem so far, but it might get really expensive.

Similar: the ""Energiewende"", the relatively rapid transition of the German electricity system from coal and uranium to ""renewables"". Might work out just fine, might be quite expensive, or it might increase energy prices enough to kill of a lot of the German industry.

Firstly, stamp duty in the UK is nearly always taken to mean tax paid on the purchase of property. It's actually stamp duty land tax, which is a transference tax. Still, say ""stamp duty"" in the UK and that's what most people think of. 

You're talking, I assume, about the traditional stamp duty on documents. From what little I know, this is a very old-fashioned form of taxation to ratify a payment or licence. And, in fact, the US does have it, but it's not enforced at federal level: it's a state-enforced tax. 

The real point, if you're trying to understand the British fear of a Tobin tax, is that the competitiveness of the London Stock Exchange would be affected by it. If there's an inherent cost in trading in the EU, then the biggest loser is the UK as it has the largest financial sector.

Per intenderci: quando spiegano cos'è un Comma al professore che non sa cos'è un Comma, quello ha sicuramente gli strumenti per capire.

La scuola deve dare innanzitutto gli strumenti di analisi e un metodo per imparare nuove cose. Se uno studia i babilonesi non è perché gli intressa davvero capire chi erano e cosa facevano nel tempo libero, ma perché facevano quello che facevano in quel periodo storico, chi è venuto prima, chi è venuto dopo e i motivi per cui sono scomparsi/evoluti/etc.

So if we all take the view that solid balance and sustainable growth is adequate, necessary for a more balanced world with less unemployment and less risk of social unrest, the conclusion is fairly straightforward.

true,canard_glasgow,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;Speaking English and watching the same American films does not mean the cultures are the same.

Nor are Scottish, English, Welsh and Northern Irish cultures the same. There is a cultural overlap, things in common that we call British culture. Many of these overlaps we still share with US/Australia/Canada/New Zealand, what cultural aspects in particular do you feel are shared by all the countries in the UK that are absent from the aforementioned countries? Are these overlaps important enough to justify the continued participation at Westminster?

&gt;The Scotnats' campaign is based on how different Scotland and the rest of us are, therefore Scotland should secede.

Bollocks. The independence referendum is based on the democratic deficit that exists in the UK. This comes down to two points with regard to Scotland. There is a difference in political ideology north and south of the border (as can clearly be seen by electoral results) and the current constitutional arrangements are not flexible enough to allow for this (the Tories currently have a free reign over large swathes of policy that directly affect people in Scotland).

This has been the case for decades and was particularly severe during Thatcher's time. The attempt to allow for flexibility within the Union, namely devolution, has not went far enough. It has been made abundantly clear that no further serious powers will be devolved and England is not willing to join in a move to federalization.

All these scare stories we hear about losing our culture, having our airport's bombed and borders being put are the unionists trying to distract from the real issue and deflect from the questions that are put to them.

&gt;There are no genetic / racial differences between Scotland and the other inhabitants of Britain;

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"I don't think the usual comparison between how Muslim immigrants are percieved and Jews in the 30s is pertinent in the least bit.

Jews, in Germany for example, stayed a relatively small population. They were mostly secular. They didn't seek to convert others to Judaism. They didn't form ethnic gangs responsible for a huge part of the country's crime. They mostly had a strong level of education and didn't make more children than the rest of the population. They tended to be highly integrated, espousing Western values, and wanted to participate in important fields, not only politics as people back then hated, but also sciences for example. 

It has absolutely nothing to do with a part of the Muslim population, recent immigrants who hate on their adoptive country, are very prominent in crime, aren't educated, and tend to embrace their ancestral countries, cultures or religion in opposition to the Western country and its values.

[EU regulates olive oil bottles in restaurants](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9fe5a71a-bf10-11e2-a9d4-00144feab7de.html#axzz2TavoS2Zd)

&gt;The rules are part of a broader initiative to help an EU olive oil industry that has struggled with weak prices.

&gt;In Germany, the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper said the regulations were the “silliest” since Brussels sought to mandate the shape of cucumbers in 1988. A spokesperson for Germany’s agriculture ministry expressed concern that the rules would force restaurants needlessly to discard olive oil, which would contradict a separate EU campaign to reduce food waste.

[Olive oil price dip adds to European woes](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/57253754-a687-11e1-aef2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2TavoS2Zd)

&gt;Spain, Italy and Greece, already fighting a financial and economic crisis, are now facing an oil crisis. Olive oil, that is. [...] Jean-Louis Barjol, executive director of Madrid-based International Olive Oil Council, said olive oil “supply was ahead of demand”. He estimated stocks would surge by the end of the current season to an all-time high of 1.1m tonnes, equal to roughly a third of annual global consumption of the commodity.

&gt;Oil World, the Hamburg-based consultancy, said in a recent report that domestic consumption of olive oil in the big Mediterranean producing countries “apparently declined so far this season as a result of the economic crisis”.

Eine wirklich bemerkenswert unverfrorene Abzocke:

Last year sitting around with my mother, my aunt (both in their late 70's) talking about gay rights.  I asked them what they though about gays having the right to legally marry.  ""Oh yes, if two people are in love, why not.  Everyone should have equal rights under the law.""  Other comments along those lines.

What I found interesting, was their absolute refusal to consider the possibility that these same legally married gay couples should be able to adopt children.  ""Oh, no, not adopt children.  No, not that.  Not the children.""

I reminded them both that as a heterosexual, single mother the reason I dumped my son's father after years of trying was because I realized that he was human garbage, incapable of being a good person, never mind a good (even reasonable or acceptable) parent.  Both of these woman hated my ex with every iota of their being because well you know the story - I was young, blinded by love - blah blah blah and they saw him for what he was.  Eventually, I woke up and got this man out of my son's life because he was being psychologically abusive to my child (and me). 

I then asked my mother/aunt did they think my son's father was any more qualified to be a parent because he was heterosexual than a gay person.

Two little old ladies in their late 70's for the first time in their lives now proudly say they believe in 'equality for all.'  Never say never.  ",0,1368815576,null,0,false,0,ca0qm7f,t3_1eijpj,t1_ca0qm7f,t3_1eijpj,null,1431124036,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

Anyone believing that Greeks woke up one morning and developed a sudden fascination with National Socialism, because allegedly a large percentage of them were and are perfectly OK with the military Junta is completely wrong. But as Greece has the most immature and uneducated Left in the world I understand why some younger people fall into the trap.

Although you might not be aware of it, your reasoning is influenced by the school of thought known as historical materialism, the school of thought of many leftist journalists and politicians in Greece. This started from Marx but you might not know it. One prominent Marxist historian is Eric Hobsbawm. He argued that the appeal of fascism was that everything ran on schedule. About Greece I will write it in Greek to you. The argument is ""η Χούντα έδωσε στον κόσμο ψωμάκι για να φάει"" and ""το κράτος λειτουργούσε ρολόι"". The Virus journalists you referred to subscribe to this interpretation in developing their alleged Junta-nostalgic narrative. Syriza's populists repeat the same fucking mantra. Utter bollocks. If a large number of immigrants were to vanish tomorrow, Golden Dawn would vanish. Greece had a decade of immiration and Golden Dawn was still a fringe party. When the immigrant numbers rose further it was LAOS that grabbed the opportunity. When LAOS was made part of the government coalition it was inevitable that it would go away, being a part of the system now.

Voting for Golden Dawn for most people meant fuck you, you made me poorer, I can't get out of my house, if you can't protect me I'll vote for those that give a shit about me.

Okay, so I browsed through some of the texts and most of it was rather a ""we will veto every time until we get a special treatment"" than ""we will block it, no matter what"" but I will still post one paragraphs as an example:

**Topic: Single European Act**

&gt; In late 1984 and early 1985, then, discussions of EEC reform went forward  separately  from  talks  on  liberalization. As  his  representative  in  the 
“Spaak II” committee, Mitterrand chose Maurice Faure, the ultra-Europeanist 
negotiator of the EEC Treaty. Though the body was known as the Dooge 
Committee after its Irish chair, Faure dominated the meetings (de Ruyt, 1987, 
p. 51; Keating &amp; Murphy, 1987; Meenan, 1985). To the horror of the British, 
who had expected the French to help block reform, Faure endorsed the “maximalist” position of the Benelux, Germans, and Italians for more majority 
voting and EP powers. He also proposed and won majority voting in the committee,  leaving  the  “minimalist”  British,  Danish,  and  Greeks  to  register 
objections in footnotes. When the Dooge Report was circulated, a French 
Foreign Ministry committee echoed British arguments against treaty revisions (Haywood, 1989; interviews). But Mitterrand approved the report, and 
so a call for reform came before the European Council at Milan in June 1985.
If Mitterrand took different positions from most of his government, the 
Dooge Committee’s deliberations better tracked other governments’ stances. 
The  British  opposed  treaty  reform. They  consistently  argued  that  informal 
return to QMV and limited recourse to vetoes were sufficient for effective decision making. They also preferred that any steps in foreign policy 
cooperation—another running discussion—take place outside formal treaties. 

(Parsons, Craig. 2010. *Revisiting the Single 
European Act (and
the Common Wisdom
on Globalization)*. Comparative Political Studies
43(6): 706 –734)












Apart from that: 

- abolition of the  UK-rebate (several times)


- creation of the [EFTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association) instead of joining the [EEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community)

You are right, though, that Britain *alone* seldom blocked policies (from what I could tell over a quick browse over my records). But *if* someone blocks a certain policy/treaty, you can be quite certain that the veto of the UK is part of it...

I answered your question two times already. Stop playing dumb. 

&gt; As you're willing to argue with evidence, I'm expecting data to support that a sizeable proportion of the Greek population current holds beliefs that are Junta-friendly

**Part 1:**

**Exhibit A:** First off, some history. [The extreme right movement of Greece has been with us for a long time and was frequently successful enough to rule the country, through various dictatorship, the military Junta of 76-74 being the most recent one.](http://eagainst.com/articles/proistoria-tis-ellinikis-akras-deksias/) Now, the Junta ruled for 7 consecutive years. This means that at the time, there was a sizeable segment of the population that supported it. The Junta was not an occupation against a defenceless populace. It had some popular support, otherwise it would be impossible for them to rule. The transition from the Junta to metapoliteysi was smooth and was not done via a revolution. A lot of these people who supported the Junta back then are still alive and had families. They weren't suddenly converted to passionate proponents of democracy. 

**Exhibit B:** LAOS was an openly extreme right-wing party that was created from people who liked the Junta and other dictatorships before it. They spread their xenophobe, nationalist, fundamentalist Christian and anti-democratic rhetoric long before the crisis. They got a respectable 7.15% in the 2009 EP elections. 

**Exhibit C:** [Eleftherotypia recently did a poll about the military dictatorship.](http://www.3comma14.gr/pi/view_survey.php?id=17326) 9% of the respondents claimed that during the Junta political freedoms were better than now. 24% of the respondents claimed that the diplomatic position of Greece was better during the Junta. Finally, a staggering 59% claimed that the Junta provided more safety than we have now. 58% of Golden Dawn supporters claimed that ""things were better during the Junta"", a much higher percentage than supporters of any other party. There are also numerous polls that ask people about their ideologies. About 4-5% openly claim that they self-identify with the extreme right. In another poll, when asked ""do you think Golden Dawn is an extremist party?"", 10% of the population replied ""no"". 

**Exhibit D:** Everyday anecdotal empirical evidence. This is pretty ubiquitous. People talk about how ""the Junta built all the roads"" and ""the Junta had paid off all the debt"". From my personal experience, I'd estimate that about 20-40% of Greeks have strong sentiments like the ones I mentioned. 

**Part 2:** 

Now, allow me to turn your argument around: You have made the claim that ""people voted Golden Dawn but not because they like their ideology but only as a protest"".

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Anyone believing that Greeks woke up one morning and developed a sudden fascination with National Socialism, because allegedly a large percentage of them were and are perfectly OK with the military Junta is completely wrong. 

You are making my argument for me. It is you who is arguing that suddenly one day people woke up and decided to massively vote for Golden Dawn. These people didn't develop a sudden fascination with Golden Dawn overnight; the seeds were already there and quietly growing since a long time ago. 

Second, I'm not saying that Golden Dawn is only getting voted by the people who were perfectly OK with the Junta. Of course harsh economic conditions will lead people to hateful ideologies. I agree with that. But to completely absolve the Greek population of any prior racism and fascism is too much. 

&gt; Although you might not be aware of it, your reasoning is influenced by the school of thought known as historical materialism, the school of thought of many leftist journalists and politicians in Greece. This started from Marx but you might not know it. One prominent Marxist historian is Eric Hobsbawm. He argued that the appeal of fascism was that everything ran on schedule.

First, Hobsbawm's explanation about the psychological appeal of fascism has nothing to do with historical materialism. Just because he was Marxist, that does not mean that everything he did had to do with historical materialism. Historical materialism completely disregards narratives and focuses solely on the material conditions. The Hobsbawm argument you quote is the complete opposite: it cares about emotional appeal and leaves the practicalities aside. 

Second, I did not ever argue that ""appeal of fascism was that everything ran on schedule"". Don't put words in my mouth. The Ιός article does not mention this as an explanation about the appeal of fascism either. They only mention it as evidence about the popularity of the Junta years later. 

&gt; Voting for Golden Dawn for most people meant fuck you, you made me poorer, I can't get out of my house, if you can't protect me I'll vote for those that give a shit about me.

That cannot explain it fully. Why did they not vote for Syriza, or Antarsya, or any other small party? Don't downplay the importance of ideology. Protest vote is an important factor in Golden Dawn's numbers but ideology cannot be ignored. 

&gt; You and other leftists don't understand that. Those of us that disagree with you are not dumber or ignorant, so stop accusing us.

Are you serious? I did not accuse anyone of being dumb or ignorant. In fact, it was you who underestimated me, not once, but twice in your comment.

true,oroboros74,sicilia,null,"Quando lavoravo in Italia (fine anni '90), mi è capitato uno studente in commissione di laurea la cui tesi non mi interessava particolarmente, ma c'era un passaggio che veramente mi incuriosiva. Così ho cercato online per avere ulteriori notizie a proposito. In pratica trovo dove lo studente aveva copiato 2/3 della tesi - plagio. Parlo brevemente con lo studente in privato, che mi ha confessato che l'aveva tradotto, e che non immaginava che fosse un gran ché di problema e che il suo relatore gli aveva dato l'OK per consegnarla. Lo studente, nel suo giorno di laurea, ritorna ai suoi parenti e amici presenti, tutti fieri, con la festa che l'aspettava, non sa come andrà a finire.

Quando ci riuniamo con la commissione, faccio nota la situazione, indicando la colpa è dello studente, ma anche del suo relatore, che ovviamente non ha letto né seguito minimamente la tesi, e che ovviamente non ha dato nemmeno il minimo appunto allo studente di come migliore la tesi. 

Io ho lottato per una mezz'oretta per non farlo laureare - non perché sono bastardo, ma perché è la cosa giusta. In altre università, lo studente sarebbe espulso. Io scrivo e pubblico, il solo pensiero che qualcuno dovrebbe rubare le mie idee (e le mie stesse parole!) mi fa incazzare. Dobbiamo essere una società responsabile, sennò come cazzo deve andare avanti l'Italia?!

Il presidente della commissione alla fine decide di dare 1 sui 11 punti possibili (vecchia laurea) allo studente (perché non era possibile dare di meno, o qualche minchiata del genere), e così si laurea lo studente, e si ricorderà per sempre questo giorno ansioso. Gli è finita bene, e penso che tu vorresti che ti vada similmente.

Ora, il plagio è un reato, e eticamente deprecabile. Traducendo il lavoro di altri, anche ""cambiando due cose qua e là"", non è giusto. Hai meno di un mese per finire la tesi? Rimuovati da Reddit, e cerca di scrivere 5-10 pagine al giorno. Prendi spunto dalla tesi degli svedesi, citali, mettici del tuo, e integra con altre info che trovi. Ma non rubare il tempo e il lavoro degli altri solo perché non sei stato motivato. Non dedicare un mese del tuo tempo a fare giorno dopo giorno una cosa deprecabile. Porta tutto quello che ti serve e se possibile lavora in biblioteca o dove non hai distrazioni. Svegliati presto la mattina e lavora fino a tardi, ma meno di un mese è ancora fattibile (soprattutto se è una prima bozza...). Se hai bisogno di un po' di motivazione in più, mandami un messaggio in privato se vuoi.

Se già sei cosciente che non è una cosa giusta, non lo fare. Non lo dimenticherai mai, e rimarrai sempre con il terrore che vieni scoperto, anche dopo il giorno della tua laurea, e non vale la pena. Meglio presentare alla fine cazzate che sono tue, e non belle parole tradotte di qualcun altro. 


EDIT: Per l'appunto, questa è solo una delle decine di storie che mi hanno portato di lasciare il mondo accademico italiano.... E sì, mi avevo anche proposto (in due separate occasioni!!) di ""preparare"" una tesi di laurea, e anche una tesi di dottorato (ma questo lo lasciamo per un'altra occasione).

Thus, education is regarded as a battlefield and a mecanism to push ""your"" consensus through establishing your ideas as the only worthed to be learnt by children -if they eventually buy your bullshit, they will become your supporters. 


Also, before any confusions emerge: the current system in Catalonia is quite successful in making individuals proficients in both languages (catalan and spanish). It requires every child to learn catalan and spanish (and english). This is the terrible price we have to pay in Catalonia if we want everybody to be able to communicate in his mother tongue: learning an additional language which is very similar to your own one. Is it so terrible?  


It's true the catalan law says lessons in non-language subjects are to be teached in catalan. It does not even occur, but anyway: there was a broad consensus in Catalonia stating that this had to be done in order to a) compensate the fact that spanish was required in first place *by constitutional law* to be learnt and b) compensate the underexposure to catalan of the spanish immigrants in Catalonia who lived in a monolingual environtment in what we could call a guetto (I have family that left Murcia in the 1940's and I can tell that is true) and c) because it is damn Catalonia and it makes a lot of sense learning catalan.  


There is still a great consensus around this, but in the recent years the populism of Ciudadanos and the Popular Party is saying: ""hey, we should have free choice of education!"". They actually mean: ""hey, we should have no obligation of learning catalan. We should be able to speak and be spoken in spanish"". Because there is not such a thing as choice between catalan and spanish. It is a choice between spanish and a few words of that weird folkoric language, and catalan AND spanish. The 3rd article of the constitution won't me modified. In my opinion their position is very similar to that of a person not complying to not drunk-driving cough aznar cough.

true,krattr,null,null,"&gt; Now, the Junta ruled for 7 consecutive years. This means that at the time, there was a sizeable segment of the population that supported it.

The Junta was a military regime that took over the country's administration with guns and ruled by fear. People were tortured, exiled and killed. US supported this regime due to the Cold War. No, military and other authoritarian regimes are not necessarily ideologically supported by sizeable segments of the general population, because they happen to rule for a number of years.

&gt; A lot of these people who supported the Junta back then are still alive and had families. They weren't suddenly converted to passionate proponents of democracy.

There is no way to quantify that. Also, what we should do with Greeks, Germans, and other people that might have been Nazi or Junta supporters on the surface, because their families were under threat? Burn them? This is not a helpful approach.

&gt; They got a respectable 7.15% in the 2009 EP elections.

Voting in the EP elections is unfortunately seen as not-that-important, in most EU countries. Voting in these elections is relaxed. Choosing a specific party does not mean that you agree will all party lines, or that you are aware of the history of some people in this party. I know people that voted for Karatzaferis because they didn't like New Democracy's new leader, although they found Karatzaferis uncultured. Go figure. Still, 93% of the voters did not choose LAOS, and LAOS's percentage in the parliamentary elections dropped significantly.

&gt;  Eleftherotypia recently did a poll about the military dictatorship.

The first thing you have to understand is that polls like that are not more important than small talk in cafeterias, invoking Papadopoulos' alleged ability in ""saving"" us. The same people saying such things would be against Papadopoulos in a couple of seconds, if they learned that Papadopoulos would not allow women's clothing that would satisfy their voyeuristic needs. The second one is that you draw the wrong conclusions. Saying that X or Y was qualitatively ""better"" back then, doesn't not mean that you want to relive what was going on back then, or that you agree with that period's regime. It also means that, for a number of reasons, some people feel that the situation is not good now. I'm not surprised that Golden Dawn supporters, most of them living in poor areas, said that under a military regime, with extreme security measures in every corner and not a single illegal immigrant in place, things were better. They do feel insecure *now*, this is why they support that things were better *then*. If they *didn't* feel insecure now, they wouldn't say otherwise. Borrowing an expression from a previous comment of yours, it's not rocket science.

&gt; Everyday anecdotal empirical evidence.

That's really subjective and I put it under the small talk category, as before. It depends on the people and the surroundings.

&gt; You have made the claim that ""people voted Golden Dawn but not because they like their ideology but only as a protest"". 

Indeed. [Let's track the number of votes of some parties](http://ekloges.ypes.gr/) and see the protest votes in action.

Yes, it wil most likely not have the desired effect and will have sizeable negative side-effects. If you wanted to stop HFT or some other supposed benefit of FFT there are far simpler and more effective means to do so.

&gt; So many things aren't/weren't global. And some nations always started with something and others saw that it was good/bad and draw conclusions from that.

The problem is that the types of trades covered by FFT can be easily moved away from the enforcement zone (directly or indirectly). Who will want to join the ""make yourself a bit poorer for no real benefit"" club?

&gt; But it will hurt them, right? And foreign exchange speculations by computers won't be profitable anymore.

It will hurt them a little but they've already got around the FFT in France before it was even implemented. It will hurt index tracking funds, small investors and the general economy more.

true,Lesnaya_Grud,null,null,"&gt;With regards to your first point, but when people mention Europe they never mean just one country...

What I mean is that even though Europe as a whole is more diverse, that whole is made up of somewhat homogenous smaller entities, whereas the U.S. has a bit more diversity throughout. For example, you can certainly say that Asia is more diverse than the United States, but for the most part when you go to Asia (assuming to just one country, whichever that may be) you're probably going to think ""this place is much more homogenous than the US"".

&gt;With regards to your second, I sort of don't/agree. The dominant anglo culture has been responsible for the oppresion of black and Native culture and dare I say it - the genocide of the Native peoples for so long it's only begun to make its way into 'mainstream' American culture in the past 50 years. Up until the present day, anglo culture has been dominant, however it is true that the liberation of black and native cultures, coupled with the constant influx of immigrants from Central America will have a (very welcome, in my opinion - despite my Belgian flag I am American as well!) large impact on the diversity of the United States in the next 20-30 years.

But American culture is and always has been more than just what we think of as ""mainstream culture"" (which is really white culture). The presence of blacks has always had a huge impact on white (Anglo-Saxon) culture and identity, even if we don't tend to think about it that way. Same with the influence of the Natives. I've heard before that one of the reasons Americans shower more frequently than Europeans is because of the early influence of Native Americans and their attitudes and practices regarding cleanliness. I think if you (we) took a more critical look at American history and culture you'd see the hidden hand of non-mainstream groups in unexpected places.

They would still culturaly british and that means European, not Asian.

&gt;I mean, I get that, but it seems arbitrarily exclusive. Why does a country need to be white and Christian to be considered European?

Just because that's how people feel it is. European = white, white = European or of European descent.

&gt;On Turkey itself, you bet they have Christian history. They conquered the ERE and all its Christian population, which transitioned from Christian to Muslim. Many European countries are currently transitioning from Christian to atheist. And Cyprus may be white and Christian, but it certainly isn't in Europe.

Yes, they have history of kidnaping christian boys and turning them into muslim warriors. Or history of genocide of christian population. Greek population didn't transition, some did that's for sure, but most did not. Turks who came were already muslim.

People are leaving christianity in big numbers but our society, traditions and mentality are hugely built on christianity.

&gt;Your definition would exclude Kosovo, Russia, Cyprus and others. And then how exactly do you define white? Spaniards can be swarthy. Are they white?

For Cyprus I'm willing to make an exception, at least for the southern part. Asian part of Russia is basically a colony, their heartland is in Europe. There are exceptions to my definition, that's for sure.

Spaniards, southern Italians, Greeks can have really dark skin. Since we know their heritage and their roots I definitely consider them white. I think it shows diversity of Europe and white race quite nicely.

These are not things set down by providence. Europeans were African before they were Europeans. South Americans were European before they were South Americans. Peoples aren't constant.

Ok, but that's not a scientific system of classification.

&gt; Yes, they have history of kidnaping christian boys and turning them into muslim warriors. Or history of genocide of christian population. Greek population didn't transition, some did that's for sure, but most did not. Turks who came were already muslim.

I mean, if you want to talk about atrocities, Europe is chock full of them. Germany almost committed complete genocide on the Jews; Portugal transported slaves like they were cattle; Spain burnt alive people at the stake.

Turkey and the Ottomans *do* have a Christian history, even if that history is pacifying the native population. But let's not even go that after; the Ottoman leader appointed the head of the Orthodox Church after the invasion because the Ottomans saw themselves as the heirs of Rome by right of conquest (Does the word Rûm sound familiar?).

&gt; Yes, people are leaving christianity in big numbers but our society, traditions and mentality are hugely built on christianity.

Update: I think I have a better understanding now. The measure is directed to branded oil bottles. For instance if your restaurant uses Bertolli bottles, than the content must be original Bertolli oil. Probably it was very easy and widespread to refill the bottles with cheaper oil rather than replace the bottles when needed. Similar to having a bottle of Heinz ketchup filled with a cheap Chinese import.

I don't think the measure applies to artisanal no-name bottles which don't reveal any brand name in the first place and you can fill with any kind of oil you like.  ",0,1368835230,null,0,1368836706,0,ca0x33f,t3_1ejcjc,t1_ca0x33f,t1_ca0wxin,null,1431120916,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

The policy needs tinkering obviously, but at face value it makes sense. Olive oil is prone to widespread fraud, and some places use refillable bottles to pass off cheap stuff as the real deal.

It also wouldn't be a trip to Barcelona without checking out Gaudí's architecture. La Sagrada Familia is a must see, and Parc Guell makes for a great day trip, and there is a small museum there which used to be his house and has some really impressive furniture that he designed.

Lastly (and this is kind of a long shot), the Dali museum located in Figueres (1.5 hrs outside of the city) is incredible. Less of a museum, more of a spectacle. Definitely worth a day trip if the resources to get there are available.

Esiste [TurnItIn OriginalityCheck](http://turnitin.com/it/products/whats-new). Sulla carta riconosce anche le traduzioni. Magari la tua università o il tuo professore non lo usa, ma se lo usa...

Anche senza aiuti informatici, se il campo in cui lavori non è enorme, non è improbabile che un membro della commissione conosca il lavoro a cui vuoi ispirarti. E, se ti scoprono, è probabile che non ti laurei.

Ho studiato in una grande università tecnica italiana: un Preside di Facoltà racconta che, durante la discussione di una tesi (prima di TurnItIn, prima di Google), gli è venuto il sospetto che l'elaborato dello studente potesse essere copiato. Ha iniziato a trapanare di domande il candidato, sempre più esitante, grigliandolo su punti profondamente tecnici della tesi.

Com'è finita? Il poveretto si è dato alla macchia e l'università non l'ha più visto. Ora, probabilmente non era una volpe (avrebbe dovuto almeno riscrivere i ringraziamenti e rilegare la tesi a caldo per non attirare l'attenzione), ma non è questo il punto...il rischio di buttare mille anni tristi di lavoro duro e vero vale la pena?

Mi permetto di proporti una riflessione. La valutazione della tesi spetta essenzialmente al relatore. Gli altri membri della commissione con ogni probabilità leggono l'introduzione e le conclusioni, sfogliano svogliatamente il testo e magari si fermano su uno-due passaggi interessanti e sulle figure mentre ascoltano la presentazione. Il tuo relatore ti conosce, presumibilmente. Trova con lui un piccolo argomento, un angolo nuovo sul lavoro di questi studenti svedesi...se studi in un ambito scientifico (come immagino) fai quattro simulazioni numeriche braindead in MATLAB e commentale, se studi le arti liberali [buttala in supercazzola](http://xkcd.com/451/). Chiedi aiuto ai tuoi colleghi, accampati in biblioteca, stalka l'advisor. Non è difficile fare qualcosa di originale, davvero. Non può andarti peggio che con una tesi copiata: è mille volte meglio (e mille volte più sicuro) fare un lavoro modesto ma originale che un lavoro tosto di cui non sai nulla. E un lavoro modesto (un lavoro da 3-4 punti, per capirci) ma originale si fa facilmente in un mese, prendendosi anche i weekend off.",0,1368837363,null,0,false,0,ca0xnpu,t3_1ej7q0,t1_ca0xnpu,t3_1ej7q0,null,1431120646,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

US supported this regime due to the Cold War. No, military and other authoritarian regimes are not necessarily supported by sizeable segments of the general population, because they happen to rule for a number of years.

You seriously think everyone just lived in fear? Are you kidding? Of course the majority were too afraid to react. However, there were lots of people that were glad to be cooperate with the regime. The tortures and exiles certainly did not apply to everyone, only to leftists. 

&gt; There is no way to quantify that. Also, what we should do with Greeks, Germans, and other people that might have been Nazi or Junta supporters on the surface, because their families were under threat? Burn them? This is not a helpful approach.

Well, all I'm saying is that the percentage is not negligible. I'm not trying to prove specific numbers. 

&gt; Voting in the EP elections is unfortunately seen as not-that-important, in most EU countries. Voting in these elections is relaxed.

Voting is relaxed, therefore people are more likely to vote with their ideology and not tactically. During the normal elections, a lot of leftists voted PASOK to prevent ND from winning and a lot of right-wingers voted ND to prevent PASOK from winning.

Retorting poll data with anecdotal evidence. A new low, even for you. 

&gt; That's really subjective and I put it under the small talk category, as before. It depends on the people and the surroundings.

I have a met a large-enough sample of people to have an idea. I can't have confidence about their exact numbers. On the other hand, I'd be extremely unlucky to meet dozens of these people if there were so few of them. Probability theory, you should look into it one of these days.


&gt; Conclusion: Greeks did not suddenly became ""fascists"", at least not more than they became leftists.

I completely agree. I never said they suddenly became fascists; I'm saying that they already were fascists or at least close enough to fascism ideologically. And yes, I also think that Syriza's huge gains cannot be solely attributed to the protest vote. A lot of the Syriza votes were also ideological.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/2066730.stm

The laws were relaxed in 2008, [as covered here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7724347.stm); that article gives the reference for the piece of legislation, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1677/88, 1988. They describe the rules for cucumbers: 

&gt; Class I cucumbers must ""be reasonably well shaped and practically straight (maximum height of the arc: 10 mm per 10 cm of the length of cucumber)"". Class II ""slightly crooked cucumbers may have a maximum height of the arc of 20 mm per 10 cm of length of the cucumber"".

&gt; These are allowed to have some blemishes and discolourations. Any cucumber more crooked must be packed separately and must be otherwise cosmetically perfect.

&gt; So if a cucumber is crooked and has a blemish on it, it cannot be sold in a shop or market. It is allowed to go for processing, but often the cost of transport to a manufacturer is prohibitive and the produce is simply allowed to rot.

Edit: I have also actually seen this at my local supermarket, in the last couple of years they've started selling 'all shapes and sizes' fruit and vegetables for cheap prices. It's definitely a good idea to be able to choose to buy fruit and vegetables which are cosmetically flawed.

Edit 2: A source directly from the Commission: http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-09-1059_en.htm:

&gt; European Union rules governing the size and shape of many fruit and vegetables will cease to exist tomorrow when specific marketing standards for 26 types of fruit and vegetables are repealed. The Commission's initiative to get rid of these standards is a major element in its ongoing efforts to streamline and simplify EU rules and cut red tape. For 10 types of fruit and vegetables, including apples, strawberries and tomatoes, marketing standards will remain in place. But **even for these 10, Member States could for the first time allow shops to sell products that don't respect the standards, as long as they are labelled to distinguish them from 'extra', 'class I' and 'class II' fruit. In other words, the new rules will allow national authorities to permit the sale of all fruit and vegetables, regardless of their size and shape.**",0,1368840634,null,0,1368841551,0,ca0yip3,t3_1ejcjc,t1_ca0yip3,t1_ca0v2yj,null,1431120241,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hi reddit! I am currently facing a bit of a dilemma regarding our close friend who happens to be particularly hateful towards Redditors and people of Redditor disposition. I personally find his behaviors unacceptable. To give to some examples, he frequently makes hateful remarks towards Redditors and brags about how his father (of MySpace ancestry) is his biggest hero for killing Reddies (as he puts it) and how he wishes that the Dot-Com Bubble would have dragged on for a bit longer for the nuclear weapons to have been used against Redditors. On top of his deplorable remarks &amp; hateful views, last week at a starbucks, he interrupted a gentleman on the phone using BaconReader by calling him a pedo after which the poor gentleman proceeded to leave the cafe with a blushed face. I never felt so embarrassed to be his friend and to be quite honest, I do not wish him to accompany us on our upcoming trip to an Internet Cafe but since he is an essential part of our group, we have no choice but to bring him with us. Oddly enough, he says he's looking forward to this trip since it will present him many ""opportunities"" to openly be hostile to Redditors, i.e. he's told us that he's going to pose as an Annoymous member with a fake mustache and do countless other stupid things. I am personally very worried that he's outrageous behaviors will put us in bad spots and I did confront him about this but he's adamant that we won't be disturbed in anyway since we're ""4channer's"" and just to get that message across, he's going to wear a ""NyanCat"" sweater. At this point, I am lost as to what I should do or how I can persuade him to limit his stupid actions.

Someone who thinks that way doesn't have a problem with a certain ethnicity, but with their thought process. When push comes to shove i'm sure that he will show the same attitude towards something else.

But if remotely true, I'd be more concerned about your friends' mental status than his racism - he sounds like he has some deeply rooted psychological issues that go far beyond ""racism towards Germans"".

That said, it's unlikely he will get into too much trouble - his juvenile antics will more likely be ignored or shrugged off unless he becomes massively confrontational.

Unlike the more menacing American police officers, German law enforcement is generally trained to seek de-escalation first and it's unlikely for him to annoy anyone severely enough to face serious consequences.

But, hey, like in any other country you may be lucky enough that he does annoy the wrong person and gets punched out. :-)

The open display of ""Nazi"" symbols and the ""Nazi"" salute is still against the law in Germany, for historic reason, that's where Germany draws the line when it comes to ""Free Speech"", so ironically enough *that's* where he could get into some serious trouble - he'll be breaking a law that was once designed to end organized racism in Germany, just not necessarily *against* Germans.


The fact that he's US American won't protect him from prosecution if he is breaching local laws. While prosecution is rare, it's very much possible and he won't find much sympathy if he does get into trouble for it. It will be assumed that he is a Nazi sympathizer and that's never a good thing here ...

Additionally, calling a German official a ""Nazi"" is pretty much the equivalent of calling an African American police officer the other ""n""-word and is an offense that can and will be prosecuted. The fact that he is a stereotypical ignorant 'MURICAN won't safe him.

I'm not entirely sure if you are aware of it, but many Americans are surprised to learn that being an American doesn't make them popular around the world, on the contrary. While anti-Americanism in Germany is comparably rare (but present, especially since the second Bush administration), you will meet a sufficient amount of people from various cultural backgrounds and countries that hold a serious grudge against Americans.

tl;dr: Some of the antics you are describing will be in breach of local laws, he can get into trouble for it. Plan your trip accordingly.",0,1368850741,null,0,false,0,ca114j5,t3_1ej7w5,t1_ca114j5,t3_1ej7w5,null,1431119013,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3
