Basically, just be aware of your surroundings at all time. Approach intersections or alleyways with caution as a car or bike might whip out of one at the last second. Also pedestrians will sometimes walk in front of you too, so be on the look out for that as well.

Another thing that we didn't realize that these Velib bikes came with is their locking mechanism. There's this cable that sticks out of the basket. I used it to tie down my bag or coat whenever we were riding around. But had I actually looked, I realized you could take this cable, wrap it around a pole or bike stand, and the other end of the cable can be inserted into the side of the bike and you can remove a ""key"" on the side of the bike and pretty much securely lock your bike up.

true,usrname42,null,null,"&gt;Happiness is the kind of deep conviction when you knwo you are where you are supposed to be and doing what you are born for, sensual pleasure is merely satisfaction of a desire. 

So what if you have a deep conviction that you are supposed to be in a relationship with someone of the same gender, and you were born to be with them? Love != sensual pleasure.

&gt;The manly man is dominant in sex, he is the penetrator, the conqueror in bed. The feminine woman is the penetrated, the conquered, the fertile land into the seed is planted. 

Why? Why is that right? Why does that have to be the case? What is wrong with it not always happening? What are the dire consequences for the world if a man is not always dominant in sex? If it is natural, why should we always do what is natural for us? 

&gt; So when a man wishes for the penetrated role, the role of the conquered in bed, not the conqueror in bed, something is wrong there.

If a man being submissive is wrong because it is abnormal (accepting your premise that it is, which I don't necessarily agree with), why isn't extreme intelligence wrong for the same reasons? Why is being sexually submissive a disability, but high intelligence not a disability? How do you tell the two apart without making a moral judgement, independent of biological facts?

&gt;Tolerance, acceptance depends on people accepting their logical places.

And what is the logic that you have used to decide on their rightful places? If it's the above, I feel there's a few steps missing.

&gt;Let men be men... be heroes. Let women be women... be mothers.

Why should men be heroes and women mothers? Why can't women be heroes and men fathers? 

&gt; I mean if pigs like bathing in mud and therefore it is OK, and if men like bathing in mud and therefore it is OK, what exactly it means to be human then? 

Isn't your argument similar? As I understand it, your argument is ""men are naturally dominant, so not being dominant is wrong"". You could equally say ""pigs naturally roll in mud, so for pigs to not roll in mud is wrong"", and that what makes us human is being able to transcend this, and do things that we might not naturally do.

&gt;&gt;How does sexual preference manage to impact on reliability in war?

&gt;Largely through being submissive, un-dominant and un-competitive.

What evidence do you have that sexual submissiveness leads to a lack of competitiveness in other areas?

Even though the Russian language is part of the Slavic (Indo-European) family, the people's geographic distribution, their general animosity towards Europe and even their facial features has led some people to believe that they shouldn't be classified as Indo-European. 

This theory has been kind of popular for quite some time. General Patton said:

&gt; The difficulty in understanding the Russians is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a European, but an Asiatic, and therefore thinks deviously. We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinaman or a Japanese, and from what I have seen of them, I have no particular desire to understand them, except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other Asiatic characteristics, the Russian have no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch, barbarian, and chronic drunk.

Justement, à mon sens c'est un des problèmes de /r/France (et franchement, c'est un problème que je rencontre malheureusement tous les jours quand je suis en France) : tout est politique ou en tout cas tout est politisé. Comme je l'ai dit dans le commentaire auquel tu as répondu, les contenus que je souhaiterais voir davantage sont apolitiques, pas politiques-mais-mainstream contrairement à ce que j'ai l'impression que tu sous entends.

J'apprends de nombreuses choses sur certains subreddits qui n'ont rien à voir avec l'actualité et encore moins avec ce qu'on appelle parfois la ""politique politicienne"". /r/France aurait le potentiel d'être la version tournée vers la France et les Français d'un micro AskReddit, TIL, ELI5, voire même un mini AskHistorians à son petit niveau.

Tu fais la distinction mainstream/courants minoritaires, mais les médias traditionnels souffrent du même biais : 

on priorise le court terme sur le long terme, on ignore les tendances de fond et les infos a priori ""banales"", on se moque des reportages sans prétention qui montrent la vie des gens telle qu'elle est et on examine les choses presque uniquement sous le prisme déformant de l'actualité à court terme et du jeu politique. En somme, on rattache tous les micros-événements du quotidien à un ""grand débat de société"" permanent (et contre-productif, IMHO).

&gt; Quoi qu'il en soit, oui: postez davantage vos propres liens et expliquez pourquoi les autres vous semblent ""faibles""

Oslo is at least up there. According to [older numbers](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/27/andrewosborn), Oslo was on top ten years ago. I can't find a Pompidou Group report that is more recent. However, Norway as a whole is [#2 behind Estonia](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/online/annual-report/2011/library/fig19) in total overdoses. If the ratio is about the same, which it just about is according to local numbers, Oslo still reigns supreme.

According to the Norwegian Institute for Alcohol and Drug Research, the reasons are plenty, but two stand out. First, there's a culture for injected heroin rather than smoked heroin, the latter of which is more prevalent in the rest of Europe. This might be because heroin has been more expensive in Norway than on the continent—the high per unit of heroin ratio is higher when injected. Overdoses are more likely when injecting the drug.

The other reason, also partially because of price, is that addicts tend to abuse other types of drugs in addition to heroin, increasing the likelihood of adverse effects and drug interactions that also lead to lower tolerance and, at worst, overdose.",0,1384545884,null,0,false,0,cdf68om,t3_1qoq4h,t1_cdf68om,t1_cdex1lg,null,1428645667,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

I am aware of that and I imagine I fall in to your third category - people who 'hide behind' religion. But since your personal classification of 'homophobia' covers everybody who might possibly raise an objection to homosexual marriage regardless of the reason, I don't really consider your evaluation to be of any value whatsoever.

&gt; I am not the spokesman of anyone. If someone is used to being called homophobic, then they night want to consider the possibility.

Except that it's also a commonly used slur that's used to attack anyone who raises an objection. There's a catalogue of these words used by so-called 'progressives' on this issue. My objection is not to the word, but your attempts to use it as a justification to silence people. You have no right to do so, and you have repeated failed to answer my calls for an explanation as to why you think you do.

&gt; And I disagree that I'm misapplying it.

But so, by omission, you do agree that you are using it to censor the opinions of others. You have admitted that you speak for no one but yourself so, again, please explain why you think you have the right to do this.

&gt; So you would lobby for a tax exemption for all of us who didn't want to finance civil marriage? What are your policy plans here?

You're highlighting your ignorance here. The Church of England is not funded by taxpayer money. If things are different in Puerto Rico then that's your business.

&gt; Britain has a lot of arcane stuff like that. If you want to argue that, then you can argue the UK isn't a democracy because the Queen reigns absolute on paper.

Except she doesn't.

&gt; In France, though, there is separation of church and state. There's no legal grounds to stand on to discriminate against gays. America too, though it's looser.

I am neither American nor French so why should their arrangements concern me?

&gt; You're still part of the EU.

The EU guarantees freedom of worship and freedom of religion is a human right. That means I have the governmental and god given right to oppose whatever sinful act I please. I may well be in the minority but that doesn't remove my rights.

&gt; You can't just say: ""I don't fit the exact definition for this exact dictionary, so I'm not one!"".

I accept that *you* might call me one. You've already stated outright that you'll happily apply the term to a huge range of people. The difference is that I know what homophobia means and I reject your attempts to use the label as a means of censorship.

&gt; Homophobia is a social problem, and your opposition to gay marriage is equivalent to the opposition to interracial marriage, and yeah, that one was racist.

We've managed just fine without gay marriage for the last 2000 years, thanks, so I don't really see how 'homophobia' can suddenly be such a big social problem. 

And your comments on interracial marriage are another fallacy - false equivocation this time - since it was never illegal in the UK, nor is it viewed as abomination by just about every religious group on the planet.

&gt; Is that a tacit acknowledgement of my ""begging the question"" statement (missed that one, didn't we)?

Yes I did, and still do. What are you referring to?

&gt; You feel antipathy towards gay rights?

I feel antipathy to the intrusion of gay rights in to the sacred sphere, certainly. Your rights end where mine begin.

I'm not sure that I agree that the relationship is mutually beneficial for both countries, as many of those thousands of people that work in Gibraltar while living in Spain then pay their taxes in one side of the border while demanding public services in the other. Also, while I thank you for those jobs, there are more than 5 millions of unemployed people in Spain, so it's not like those jobs are saving our economy.

There is no Supreme Court that will strike down legislation as infringing against the rights of the member states; the European Supreme Court is like the French or British ones: it does not in practice strike down laws as being ""illegal"" or ""unconstitutional"" vis-a-vis the constitution, on grounds of states rights. Gradually, the court adds to the areas of federal responsibility; indeed laws are passed at federal level just to achieve this. In *theory*, the powers of the federal lawmakers are limited by Treaties negotiated by member state politicians, but these are effectively ignored (and are increasingly difficult to get past national referendums).
 
The second chamber of the (EU) federal legislature (like the US or Canadian Senate) is ex-officio the *executive* branches of the member state governments; that's like saying that the federal senate is Governor Christie and Rick Perry and Lincoln Chafee and so on (or the Canadian premiers). Does this lead to executive-friendly legislation? You bet it does. Does this mean that local heads-of-government can bypass the state legislature by getting their policies through at federal level? That's almost the point. Germany practises this system internally: its federal upper house, the Bundesrat, comprises the German state governments.

The executive branch of the (EU) federal government is appointed, not elected; the federal legislature and member states cannot shut down the government to bring it to heel, though the legislature can compel the entire federal executive to resign en masse (which it once did to get rid of a few ministers).

There is no European demos or common European feeling; the generality of the populations of each state do not consent to the level of responsibility which has been assumed by the federal government, and are largely unaware how far the process has gone. Almost no laws are introduced at federal level as a result of popular pressure. The system has existed for 60 years - I can't think of a single law which has been passed as a result of an election campaign or demonstration or petition. Maybe there has been about one per decade. Effectively, there's negligible democratic input to the federal executive's agenda - certainly no way the public can stop it or influence it. Fundamentally, the people of each member state are not prepared to consent to being bound by a federation-wide majority on any issue: in America or Canada, the public accepts that, say, trade policy can be decided federally, but that employment legislation is (roughly) a state matter.

The fact that 75% of all countries do worse, does not bring me satisfaction as long as I know it can be done better.  

Btw the advantage of all those background checks is that your rights as a tenant are set in stone. Rents in Romania can be terminated at the landlords wish. Whereas in France for example the tenant's rights are basically set in stone (and it is like that since Napoleon). 

Your tenant's contract in Romania is often nothing but a one pager with an address, and two witnesses, and id cards. There are no strict laws that augment that contract automatically in favor of you the tenant. 

With all the protection you get in the West, it is only natural for owners be picky and extra diligent. In exchange you get security and the ability to plan your life better, i.e. know that your children will travel the same short route to the same kindergarten / school you picked before starting the hunt for a rent. 

You can invest in furniture as you know that you will be living there until you can pay the rent. Actually way longer than that if you are blood sucking parasite , or someone who for whatever reason faces temporary problems. In France tenants cannot be evicted during winter for example. Further owners cannot sell the house without good reason. Even if they have a good reason you have the right of first refusal at a reasonable price. 

There are no social judgement or pressure on renters, while the same cannot be said about Romania nor Hungary (albeit in the latter the effect is less pronounced).

I'm not going to be able to explain the EU in a reddit post and I am not going to try.

The main difference to for example the US is that it is a union of sovereign countries. The Eurocrats sit there and try to come up with how to allow EU members to cooperate over national borders in a way that is agreeable for everybody. If an agreement is found, it issues *regulations* or *directives* (that the member states are required to forge into national law).

The member states are free to administrate as they want or as they always did, as long as EU law is met, so you find that they are subdivided in completely different ways. At the same time at EU policy often considers various ""regions"", often across borders, that are economically or culturally connected, like for example the border regions of France and the UK divided by the Channel.


The most important institutions are

* the *European Parliament* (as the name implies, legislative, represents the citizens, elected every 5 years)

* the *Council of the European Union* (legislative, one minister per member state, rotating presidency)

* the *European Commission* (proposes new laws, one commissioner per country assigned to a certain field a bit like national ministers)

* the *European Council* (heads of states of the member states: policy)

* the *Court of Justice of the European Union*

Then there's also the *European Central Bank* and the *Court of Auditors*.

Note that there is also the Council of Europe, which is not an EU institution.

I think most people will agree that the EU is a bit of a mess, mirroring Brussels to some extent ;) because it is a work in progress.

I personally do not see inequality as a fundamental evil. In my opinion as long as a minimum level of quality of life is achieved then inequality is not really a problem. 

In truth fairness doesn't really matter. I believe that governments should make sure that wealth doesn't become entrenched by measures such as estate taxes but beyond that economic growth should be prioritized over fairness.

But do workers really realize the usefulness of the executives who run their companies? It seems that executives would have a better understanding of the economics than the workers. Executives often own  large amounts of a company's stock so they have the incentive to ensure their company does well.

""But after the division of labour has once thoroughly taken place, it is but a very small part of these with which a man's own labour can supply him. The far greater part of them he must derive from the labour of other people""

Thinking in terms of executives and employees is the wrong way to look at this, it's about Capital Owners and Workers, while Executives often tend to own stock in the company they don't necessarily by definition and when they do not they are simply managers whose power is wholly dependent on the permission of the owners of the firm to manage it for them.

Would the firm operate differently worse without these executive managers? Perhaps they would yes, and the difference would become clear in a Socialist society if some firms chose to retain managers and others did not, over time the better structure would win out as if it was more profitable to have higher paid managers on top it would be better for the entire firm to have them.

Would the firm operate differently if Capital Owners were in control? Not necessarily at all. 

In a market controlled by workers rather than Capital Owners over time the most efficient firms will win out, why wouldn't it? Yes they could just choose to take everything for themselves and let the company go to ruin but so could Capital Owners right now, the difference is people understand that in the long run they will lose out more in this way.

The only difference is that the people who own the firms actually have a long term interest in it's existence being that their livelihood is based there, for a Capitalist in the modern economy he can simply jump to and fro from firms, thus executives are appointed and commanded to operate firms not for the interest of long term sustainability but for short term profits to appease these fickle investors who don't have to care what happens to a company five years down the line.

How to even start?! 

In 1946 Winston Churchill called for 'a United States of Europe' 

The EU is not that, but it is a half-way house, a sort of dysfunctional family of Europe. 

It started off as the European coal and steel community, a body to prevent Germany and France going to war over the Rheinland as they were wont to do, but it's grown and evolved hugely since then. 

Discussing its exact scope is a bit tricky since certain institutions, such as the European Central Bank, stand with one foot in and one foot out.  

There's this out-dated but still handy guide from the BBC which gives a basic run downs on the functions of the [various bodies](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/europe/04/eu_institutions/html/ntroduction.stm)

But as I say it's already out of date, we currently have 28 member states, not 27 and the Treaty of Lisbon which is being implemented will alter the existing structures some what. For example instead of having 1 commissioner per member state we will have 2/3rds of States with Commissioners at a time. 

It's nearly impossible to explain the EU and its associated bodies succinctly since it is very unique, very complex and in a seemingly constant state of flux. 

This diagram shows the [basic structure](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Political_System_of_the_European_Union.svg/721px-Political_System_of_the_European_Union.svg.png) of how the key institutions work together. 

It is neither a confederation nor a federation, but a mixture of both, with member states being subject to differing levels of EU laws and regulations depending on whether they use the common Euro currency are in the Schengen free travel area etc. 

Major changes are made through treaties, as would be used when negotiating with foreign countries, but once these treaties are ratified they act as quasi-constitutional law in governing how the EU operates. 

However, EU has very limited scope to enforce its rules and relies heavily on the voluntary good will and co-operation of member States.

Certo che si', e succede nelle aule di scuola superiore di mezzo mondo (la meta' piu' progredita, guardacaso). 

In questo, stiamo pagando un'eredita' culturale pesantissima: da un lato i vecchi marxisti-leninisti (""L'economia e' capitalismo, che e' merda e tanto dura poco""), dall'altro i cattointegralisti (""il denaro e' lo sterco del demonio"" - e  vai coi ricchi, il cammello e la cruna dell'ago).

 Il risultato e' una generazione che non ha idea, e per questo e' facile preda degli  urlatori da strada (vedi Grillo), ma e' anche pronta a inchinarsi al primo che *sembra avere la reputazione* di capirci qualcosa (vedi Monti), a prescindere da chi o cosa rappresenti.

La politica puo' suggerire come i governi debbano influenzare i processi economici, e questo puo' anche portare a conflitti spietati (vedi le ultime polemiche teorici-della-trappola-di-liquidita' contro anti-inflazionisti). Si puo' anche non essere d'accordo sulle diagnosi, come e' successo e succede nella recessione che stiamo vivendo.

Ma sulle basi, sulle cose scontate, se non si e' d'accordo e' solo mancanza di un minimo di cultura.  

Molte delle cose che hanno suscitato piu' entusiasmo nel *thread* precedente mi hanno fatto cascare le braccia.

Spain signed the treaty of Utrecht which gave us Gibraltar in perpetuity. That means FOR EVER. There is no good legal or practical reason to over turn that.

British territories are held on the basis of self determination of peoples. So long as those living on Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands WANT to be British they shall remain so.

That's fine. It's not my personal definition, though. I simply gave you the Wikipedia article.

&gt; Except that it's also a commonly used slur that's used to attack anyone who raises an objection. There's a catalogue of these words used by so-called 'progressives' on this issue. My objection is not to the word, but your attempts to use it as a justification to silence people. You have no right to do so, and you have repeated failed to answer my calls for an explanation as to why you think you do.

Except you're not being silenced at all, nor do I expect you to be. It'd be boring if you stopped responding.

Also, you're aware no liberal calls himself a ""progressive"", right? Progressive was the word used decades ago when ""liberal"" was a dirty word in America. It's just ""liberal"" now, thanks.

&gt; But so, by omission, you do agree that you are using it to censor the opinions of others. You have admitted that you speak for no one but yourself so, again, please explain why you think you have the right to do this.

I don't understand how I'm censoring you. I lack that power, and the desire.

&gt; You're highlighting your ignorance here. The Church of England is not funded by taxpayer money. If things are different in Puerto Rico then that's your business.

We're talking about civil marriage. Does the Church of England control it? Because, as I understand it, gay marriage is legal over there now, innit?

Look at me, being all civil with you and stuff! It's not something you're quite willing to do yet, but we'll get there.

&gt; Except she doesn't.

On paper? You lack a written constitution. The authority of the government of the UK is vested in the Crown. Hell, you even have Crown possessions that aren't legally part of the UK.

In practice, obviously not true, but the same applies to the separation of church and state, unless I'm mistaken.

&gt; I am neither American nor French so why should their arrangements concern me?

Because we were talking about gay marriage in France.

&gt; The EU guarantees freedom of worship and freedom of religion is a human right. That means I have the governmental and god given right to oppose whatever sinful act I please. I may well be in the minority but that doesn't remove my rights.

But not freedom to disenfranchise others for no reason. Not freedom to use the coercive power of the state to discriminate.

&gt; I accept that you might call me one. You've already stated outright that you'll happily apply the term to a huge range of people. The difference is that I know what homophobia means and I reject your attempts to use the label as a means of censorship.

Your definition is outdated. Words change. Opposing gay rights is considered to be homophobia in the 21st Century. And whole I'm sure it applies to a large number of people, I'm sure that, at least in the West, it's an ever shrinking minority.

&gt; We've managed just fine without gay marriage for the last 2000 years, thanks, so I don't really see how 'homophobia' can suddenly be such a big social problem.

We've also managed just fine with slavery for thousands of years, and we still got rid of it. And then segregation. And then we just wanted to stop interracial marriage.

And, uh, that's an appeal to tradition, isn't it?

&gt; And your comments on interracial marriage are another fallacy - false equivocation this time - since it was never illegal in the UK, nor is it viewed as abomination by just about every religious group on the planet.

I'm not even going to look up the fallacy for this one. It doesn't matter what the UK was like; interracial marriage was banned in some countries, and the arguments you're using were *exactly* the arguments they were using. Identical. They said they weren't racist, too.

What's the difference in your arguments and theirs?

&gt; Yes I did, and still do. What are you referring to?

Well, I committed a fallacy. I didn't know if you held an antipathy towards gay rights; I merely presumed it. I put the conclusion ahead of the question.

&gt; I feel antipathy to the intrusion of gay rights in to the sacred sphere, certainly. Your rights end where mine begin.

There's no sacred sphere in government. I'm a filthy heathen, and I refuse to pay for your civil marriages if you are going to apply them unequally based on the books *you* believe in.

Do whatever you want in your church, though.

Le truc sur l'euro faible ne veut bien evidemment rien dire, par contre. Tu ne peux pas avoir une politique de change avec une telle monnaie. Sachant qu'en plus ca ne sert a rien... Tu va gagner quoi en devaluant ? Que dalle. Sur le court terme, tes exportations seront moins cher mais tes exportations plus cher (ce qui n'est pas vraiment dans l'interet de la France en plus, vu sa balance commerciale). Sur le long terme rien du tout vu que la monnaie est neutre.

No. Permettetemi, ma no.

Io ascolto eccome, perché vivendo in Puglia (al contrario di molti di voi) so quanto male ha fatto l'ILVA a Taranto. So che centinaia di persone sono morte di tumori vari a causa dell'ILVA, so che i lavoratori hanno venduto il loro diritto alla salute in cambio di pochi sporchissimi soldi. E in tutto ciò, il Governatore della mia regione ci sguazzava (lasciamo stare la risata sullo scatto felino di Archinà, non mi riferisco a quella), chiamava i capoccia dell'ILVA per rassicurare che non si era dimenticato di loro, ignorando bellamente la salute dei propri cittadini e magari facendo pressioni sull'Arpa per far chiudere un occhio (dico facendo perché il processo è in corso, ma qui in Puglia è un po' il segreto di Pulcinella). Lui è parte del sistema che ha lasciato ai Riva la piena libertà dalle regole e l'impunità assoluta per decenni, durante i quali i cittadini di Taranto sono stati presi per il culo multiple volte, col risultato che ora si è arrivati a dover scegliere tra la salute e il lavoro.

Date tutte queste premesse, io VOGLIO ascoltare cosa si dicono, io VOGLIO scandalizzarmi, io VOGLIO incazzarmi come una iena, perché Vendola non è un privato cittadino, non è un conoscente qualsiasi che magari con me è gentile e poi mi sparla alle spalle: Vendola è il fottutissimo Governatore della mia regione, ed ESIGO un comportamento integerrimo innanzitutto verso i cittadini, soprattutto quelli di Taranto.

true,NSA_Approved,EURO,Citizen of the Galaxy,"&gt; In Finnish, ""mesi"" is nearly synonymous with ""hunaja"", so there's still a Finno-Ugric version of honey.

The relationship between these two words is actually quite interesting. I doubt that there's enough historical data to trace the origin of either of these words in Finnish, but I would guess that ""mesi"" is of older origin and had the same meaning as ""hunaja"" does now.

The modern meaning of ""mesi"" is *nectar* (the liquid produced by plants, not the drink), but it is still used to mean *honey* in some compounds. A still somewhat common example of this is ""mesikämmen"" (""kämmen"" = *palm*), which is an old euphemism [1] for *bear* and is still sometimes used in poems, stories and such. In this context the meaning *nectar* for ""mesi"" is dubious and I think it's more likely that the original meaning of the word was *honey*.

The word is also used in ""mesimäyrä"" (honey badger) and here again the meaning *honey* makes more sense than *nectar*.

**tl;dr** It's likely that ""mesi"" originally meant *honey*, but was later replaced by ""hunaja"" and the meaning of ""mesi"" changed (or was limited) to *nectar*. So, as you said, ""Finland suddenly turned Germanic"". :P

[1] Due to [bear worship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_worship) euphemisms were often used when talking about bears to avoid calling the attention of the animal to yourself, and many of these still remain in the Finnish language (even the modern word for bear, ""karhu"", was originally an euphemism).",0,1384559119,null,0,false,0,cdfbmd4,t3_1qp2oe,t1_cdfbmd4,t1_cdezjsb,null,1428643086,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

""It's important to examine Mundell's arguments for the euro, justifications he presents to this day. In Mundell's view, the weaker European countries relied excessively in devaluations to remain competitive, saddling them with high inflation and interest rates, and slow growth. The crutch of devaluation enabled them to maintain labor laws that made workers overly expensive because of heavy government-mandated benefits and ensured that wages would rise faster than prices. By making it impossible to reduce prices of computers, appliances or vacations on in the global marketplace by devaluing, nations would be forced to lift productivity, and moderate wages, as the only route to staying competitive. Hence, the euro would exert market pressure to banish restrictive labor laws that had been a European institution, and economic curse, for decades.""

I found and translated two recipes:

**Ingredients for 15 servings:**

1 liter of blackcurrant juice (attenuated, ~25% fruit content)*

1 liter of cherry juice (attenuated, ~35% fruit content)*

1 liter of grape juice

500 ml naturally cloudy apple juice,

5 cardamom - pods

5 cloves

2 rods cinnamon crumbled

1 limes, untreated, sliced

some lemon or lime juice

Mix all ingredients, except lemon juice, heat them, slowly and gently in a large cooking pot. Let it draw for a few hours (stove off).
Before serving, heat again until the Glühwein fumes. Season with lime juice.

Due to the apple juice the mixture is very sweet. We pour the mulled wine either through a tea strainer into cups or into a teapot to keep warm on the portable hearth.

Can be garnished with a lime slice in the cup. If it tastes too sweet for one's taste it can be diluted with your choice of tea (rooibos, black tea, certainly with fruit).

Working time: 10 minutes

Resting time: 3 hours

-* In the recipe it is called ""nectar"", which in Germany - because of some absurd marketing strategy - means juice with less than 100% fruit content. The percentages I gave you are the minimum requirements for fruit contents of such products by law.

*or a simpler version with tea*

**Ingredients for 4 servings:**

½ liter of tea (red fruit)

0.3 liters of juice (tangerine juice, orange juice works also)

1 cinnamon - rod

already mixed Glühwein spices (if you can get that), typical are star-anise, cardamom, cloves, lemon peel, fennel, ....

Syrup (Grenadine), sweet

Cook the fruit tea as usual, but add all the spices and let it steep longer (I guess ideally also a few hours). Fill it in a cooking pot, add the tangerine juice and heat it briefly. Sweeten with grenadine.

Working time: about 10 minutes

I think if you prepare the ingredients the kids can, after seeing, smelling, and possibly tasting the different spices, just throw the stuff in, stir it, and later get the result. Of course for safety you would also have to cook the tea beforehand and heat it up again after the spices were added. Otherwise, if you want to avoid chaos, I am sure the it would be valued if you would make the ""wine"" yourself, bring it to the school and just heat it up there.

Another idea: if your turn is before the sixth of december, the kids could craft [this](http://www.basteln-gestalten.de/nikolaus-basteln), you fill it with candy and give it to them back on St Nicholas' Day. It is a tradition in (parts of) Germany that on the day before St Nicholas' Day you put a boot (we had a special bag with a boot on it) in front of your door and on the next day they are filled with candy and little gifts...or coal if you were a naughty child.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"The most important document you can read about the EU is still the [Schuman Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuman_Declaration). It's a political long term project by economic means, to stabilise the continent and make war permanently impossible through economic entanglement. The rest is all technicalities.

The effect the EU has in practice is that it removes barriers of trade through EEA wide regulations and directives (guidelines that the members then implement in their respective national laws). You almost always only ever notice when it doesn't work, matters where it works are just seen as ""normal"".  
Even in Canada, you probably have seen the [CE mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_marking) on various products. Odds are, you're looking at something that has it right now. What it means is that the product complies with EU regulations regarding safety, health, the environment, and so on. For manufacturers and importers, it means that the same standards apply throughout the EEA, and products have to be tested only once.  
Now, try to imagine a world where it wouldn't exist. Countries would still need, say, safety regulations. So, for a product to be sold in that market, manufacturers or importers would have to hire a bunch of engineers and lawyers to read those regulations, and then pay for certification. For some products this is easy, for others it's quite expensive and the market might just not be worth the trouble and the product just wouldn't be available there. But with the CE mark valid for such a large market, manufacturers will read the regulations during the design phase, build to spec, go through the certification process once, and it will be available throughout the EEA all at once.

It's similar with consumer protection. Take EU privacy regulations, for example. It may not seem obvious what they have to do with trade, but when you think about it, it means that e.g., a web shop can use the services of an online payment company in another member country to handle orders from customers in a third, without even worrying about it.

The EU can make companies do things. Manufacturers of things like cars or consumer electronics have to take products back at the end of their life cycle and recycle the materials. Imagine if only one of the smaller members would have tried to enact such a rule on its own, most companies would have just withdrawn, alone to make an example of them. But since the EU introduced those regulations, they have little choice but to comply.  
Another example would be mobile chargers. A couple of years ago, the EU decided that mobile chargers piling up on the garbage dumps were an issue, so it told manufacturers that if they wouldn't agree on a standard, the EU would do it for them. This is why all smart phones can be charged through micro-USB (Apple works around this with an adapter).  
Particularly for environmental regulation, this has as much of an internal effect as an external one. If an individual country would try to enact strict environmental standards on its own, companies would just move manufacturing elsewhere. Same with animal rights, hens can't be kept in cages in the EU.  

Of course, if you want to have EU wide regulations, the question arises who decides on those things. This is why the EU needs a decision making process, and that in turn requires a political structure to legitimise it. It also means that countries have to surrender sovereignty over those areas affected by the directives and regulations to the EU. This is never popular, and that economies in the various countries are structured differently and have often competing interests doesn't exactly help.",0,1384563976,null,0,1384564217,0,cdfdckd,t3_1qpphg,t1_cdfdckd,t1_cdfaoq0,null,1428642280,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

The directives are usually passed into national laws by member states and these directives cover pretty much anything from human rights to most mundane things (like regulations on [production and disposal of batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_directive)).

But many of the most important policies of the EU are not directly visible in day to day life, even when they have significant effects. For example, the [Common Agricultural Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy) shapes the agriculture of the member states significantly, but few people are aware of its actual effects in day to day life (for example in food prices) because the policy itself is complex and understanding it and its effects requires special knowledge and lots of studying.

Another very significant agreement is the [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area), which effects pretty much all commerce within the EU, but again it's not directly visible in day to day life, unless you are involved in business or otherwise well-versed in economics. One of the actually ""significant"" parts of this is that it grants EU citizens (i.e. citizens of the member states) a freedom to work and study in other member states.

Like others have pointed out, the EU is basically a huge mess of organizations (as an example, [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Supranational_European_Bodies-en.svg) a diagram of some of the biggest EU related organizations), legislation, bureaucracy, etc. and that makes it pretty difficult to define the EU in a meaningful way (without using 100,000 words), and it's also very frustrating for people who are actually interested in the union, because it's almost impossible to understand even fraction of what goes on within all the EU organizations -- unless you devote yourself to it full-time.

Edit: As further examples of the tangled mess the EU is: [Political System of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Political_System_of_the_European_Union.svg), [Treaties of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union#Ratified_treaties), [Institutions of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutions_of_the_European_Union#Summary).

true,Maldorno,null,null,"&gt;Non. La raison d'être d'ELI5, c'est de vulgariser autant que possible afin de poser des bases et d'introduire des sujets qui paraissent intimidants ou excessivement complexes.

Ben écoute, j'ai pas fait 7 ans d'études postbac pour me faire rincer par du ELI5, c'est un gimmick de subreddit comme les DAE, AMA, TIL dont j'ai à peu près rien à faire et qui ne m'intéresse pas. Ce ne sont pas des discussions et ça ne s'adresse pas à un utilisateur de /r/France. Pour moi, il s'agit clairement de ce que reddit fait de très mal et que n'importe quelle satire de ce site souligne d'emblée. Maintenant si tu trouves ça bien, c'est ton opinion. Accepte juste que tout le monde ne soit pas un fan de ce type de contribution. 

&gt;Pour ne prendre que le premier exemple que je vois affiché en voyant ton lien au moment où je t'écris : What is Game Theory : le premier commentaire vient d'un économiste qui développe un peu sur le concept (avec lequel j'ai vu très peu de Français se dépatouiller, au passage) et fournit des ressources pertinentes en anglais pour aller plus loin, les deuxième et troisième commentaire expliquent très brièvement et très simplement le concept en question.

Je les trouve incomplets et verbeux. Autant prendre wikipedia donc. Je ne vois toujours pas ce que /r/France gagnerait à avoir du ELI5. Ce ne sont pas des contributions de qualité. C'est le plus petit dénominateur commun fait par des gens dont on ne peut même pas vérifier le crédit. 

&gt;C'est quelque peu facile de te laisser cette option confortable quand tu critiques un subreddit, parce que du coup évidemment chaque contribution de qualité que je vais te montrer va selon toi rentrer dans la catégorie ""oui mais je pense que ça serait mieux ailleurs"", comme par un tour de passe-passe.

Ben non, je vois pas en quoi c'est facile de dire qu'un type qui demande ce que c'est la théorie des jeux y gagnerait à aller dans le subreddit afférent ou de googler wikipedia ou d'aller sur coursera. C'est la réponse qu'il faut donner. l'utilisateur de ELI5, c'est le consommateur passif de contenu type lycéen de 15 ans.

&gt;La question n'est pas tellement de savoir quel contenu est posté dans quel subreddit, elle est de savoir qu'il y'a effectivement des espaces de discussions constructives sur Reddit qui vont au délà de la revue de presse politique du moment

Tu ne m'as toujours pas dit en quoi ELI5 était constructif. Le concept reste celui du plus petit dénominateur commun. 

/r/France reste un sub généraliste autour de la communauté française ( éventuellement francophone ) pour parler de la France. Si les sujets de type CMV, ELI5, DAE, AMA ont fini par se créer des sub particuliers, c'est pour une raison simple ils orientaient d'autres sub vers un type de contenu pré-mâché qui entamait leur vocation première. Introduire ce type de sujet de manière chronique sur le sub nuirait à sa dimension généraliste. 

A partir du moment où on parle d'une communauté et de n'importe quel de ses aspects, on parle de politique. Culture, éducation, santé, sport, histoire, technologie ( va voir sur le sub /r/technology et dis moi si 80% du contenu n'est pas à dimension politique ). Le problème actuel du sub, c'est le militantisme extrême-gauche ( dont 90% des modos ) et le militantisme FN ( de quelques utilisateurs très présents ) qui font dérailler toutes les discussions et la propension au downvote qui les empêche carrément. On pourrait envisager un contenu éditorial pour des sujets moins politiques hebdomadaires ou mensuels mais vu l'équipe de modérateur j'ai quelque doutes sur sa mise en place ou sur son caractère vraiment dépolitisé ( il faudrait discuter avec les users avant quoi ).

true,kmjn,GREE,Greece,"&gt; Of course, in the US we ask “How are you?” as a type of greeting, and the response “Fine” or “Well” is somewhat of a formality. This is confusing to many Europeans I met. When they ask the question, they sincerely mean it. And the response is just as honest. “How are you?” to a Lithuanian may prompt an honest ten-minute spiel about how shitty his day is going.

Depends on the circumstances, but it's actually quite common in the U.S. for people to give a real answer, too. I've had workers at coffee shops answer the question with a long rant about some rude customers who had come in earlier in the day, that kind of thing. It's kind of an open question: the person can choose to answer it with a ""fine"" or ""ok"", or they can choose to answer it in more depth.

Part of the cultural difference is that in much of Europe, an employee would never give a detailed answer about how their day was, so the question would be taken as clearly insincere, since there is no possibility of answering it sincerely. Here in Denmark, at least, it would be really strange if the guy at a grocery store checkout said more than a few words to you, unless you knew each other from somewhere else. But in a Trader Joe's in California, say, it's pretty common for customers and the employees to have actual conversations while checking out.

Something similar is common in a few European languages, mostly in southern Europe. For example two common greetings in Greece are *ti kanis?* and *ti ginetai?*, roughly ""how're you"" and ""what's happening / how's it going"". Spanish has basically the same two, *¿Cómo está?* and *¿Qué tal?*. The person then has a choice, depending on circumstances and inclination, between answering with a generic ""fine"" or ""eh, same as usual"", or giving a more detailed answer.",0,1384570663,null,0,1384571465,0,cdffm4r,t3_1qq7hr,t1_cdffm4r,t3_1qq7hr,null,1428641223,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

This is the problem right here, and it is the reason proletariat revolutions are a bad idea. Yes, even in the Oh, So Enlightened US of A there is an aristocratic class that has most of the wealth *and* an amount of power disproportionate to their numbers. But the situation we face is a lot like Gandalf *vis-a-vis* The One Ring.

Basically, he could have taken the Ring from Bilbo, used its mighty power to slay Sauron and defeat the forces of Mordor, but it would have corrupted him into a being of great evil in the process. If we, as the proles, supported an armed revolution that sought to dissolve the estates of the rich through force of arms, then *we* would become the ones arbitrarily exerting power.

I think its better if we pool our wealth into organizations that will represent *us*, that we counter their lobbyists with our own, that we advocate collectively for the rights of workers, and that, so long as we can feed our families and enjoy our homes, we don't worry as much about fat-cats picking caviar out of their teeth with ivory tooth picks.

Besides, if the Horatio Alger story is a myth for the life of a single person (very few will raise themselves from poverty to the ranks of the super-rich) in this country it's actually pretty straightforward to raise yourself from poverty to the middle class. And if you were born in the middle class, the breaking into the ranks of millionaires takes a combination of luck and toil, but that is actually done relatively often. In fact, the vast majority of major corporate officers, (CEOs, CFOs, CTOs, etc.) had middle class upbringings. Even if you are born among the poor, you can always make a life so that your children can improve upon your legacy if they so choose.

The German current account surplus is not a measurement of the country's competitiveness but rather how much it exports more than it imports or ""*the balance between domestic production and consumption*"". The competitiveness of Germany is in reality shown in the [volume of its exports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_exports) (which is remarkable enough in itself), not in the difference between those and its imports. The Commission considers that member states have an imbalance if the deficit is set at more than 4 percent of GDP over three years while an imbalance on surpluses is set at 6 percent of GDP. Last year the German surplus was 7 percent of GDP that's why the surplus is grabbing the attention of EU leaders.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; German companies are successful exporters and if the country makes a surplus it's suddenly subject to an investigation? 

Germany's current account surplus consists of many factors of which exports is only one part. 

There has been a very polarized debate over Germany's surplus, in which the actual structure of the surplus is either forgotten or misrepsented. For some reason people have tended to concentrate only on the exports of goods and Germany's competiteveness and success there. Therefore on one side we have those arguing that Germany should reduce its surplus through fiscal stimulus to lift southern Europe, and other side arguing against such. Yet that polarized debate leads nowhere and borders going after red herrings. 

It has poisoned the discussion to the point that many seem to believe that merely launching an inquiry into the surplus would mean going after the exports and destroying Germany's competitiveness there (which, btw, would make no sense). Not so. 

Olli Rehn wrote recently an informative blogpost about the surplus: [Turning Germany’s surplus into a win-win for the eurozone](http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/rehn/turning-germanys-surplus-into-a-win-win-for-the-eurozone/)

true,anarchisto,ROMA,Romania,"In one word, the problem is **corruption** and, associated with it, widespread poverty.

Some details, based on Romanian politics (I'm certain it's the same in Bulgaria):

The political system is a sham democracy. You can choose between several parties, but their policies are practically identical. It doesn't matter who you choose because the result is identical. You might think that in the US or Western Europe, it doesn't matter, but here the difference is really nil.

The political parties are some kind of a closed castes. You need to know someone in order to get inside. When you get inside, you *must* be involved in their shady deals, or else, you'll not be promoted. There is no such thing as a clean and honest person in our politics and I really mean *literally none*, no exceptions. Such a honest person would not be controllable by the leaders of the party, and as such, would be unreliable and might even try to rid out of their corruption system. 

The idea is that all the party leaders have their own clients (lower-level members), whom they control through blackmail and internal bribing. These people also have some lower party members and so on, until the lowest members. 

----

Every public contract involves corruption. Yes, even (or rather, especially) the big Western corporations pay bribes; yes, IBM (I worked for them at one time, so I know about it from non-public sources), Ericsson, Bechtel, Siemens, Mercedes, etc. pay bribes to Romanian officials. I read a study that said that more than a third of the state budget is lost through corruption. That's probably an underestimation. 

Anyway, the ""public service"" works like this: some guy bribes his way through the party lines to become a director, a minister or whatever public official; then he tries to get as much money out of his new office as possible.

The corporations (or sometimes, local companies) sell goods and services at a hugely inflated markup (often 100-200% more than the free market), part of which is given to the state official who approved the deal.",0,1384605921,null,0,1384608155,0,cdfmv2q,t3_1qr6u2,t1_cdfmv2q,t3_1qr6u2,null,1428637771,520,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,520

The article does not say what exactly has been done to girls in Scotland. But my guess is that it varies as FGM covers such a wide spectrum of practices.

&gt; Seems like a waste.

Indeed. Luckily the clitoris is a quite large organ and mostly internal. The external visible part is only a tip of the whole clitoris, and can be restored with plastic surgery.

Yep, it's very interesting and to some extent even makes evolutionary sense: we wouldn't have a foreskin unless it had useful functions.

I very much agree that the HIV argument is at best irrelevant to the infant circumcision to the point of being silly as 1) infants do not get STDs by their irresponsible sexual behavior, and 2) HIV rates in Nordic countries are very low and it's unclear how some suspect studies conducted in Africa, in areas with severe HIV epidemics, would be applicable in the Nordic countries. And just as expected 3) the campaigns to get African men circumcised has already led to rising HIV rates among them: [Botswana HIV infection among circumcised men “rises”](http://en.starafrica.com/news/botswana-hiv-infection-among-circumcised-men-rises.html)

What's also interesting is how the HIV argument and the assumption of the foreskin as a vector for disease relates to the medical history of circumcision. 

Circumcision has always been *""A solution in search of a problem""*, as Edward Wallerstein put it. Here's a fun compilation of various scientific falsehoods used as a misinformed medical justification for circumcision through its history: http://www.icgi.org/medicalization/#Page_1

From ""curing"" perfectly natural things such as wet dreams and masturbation to beliefs that it would cure paralysis, bedwetting, crossed eyes, epilepsia, deafness, tuberculosis, cancer, clubfoot, and more. In 1894 an article argued that circumcising the “Negro” would reduce the rape of white women, and in 1991 a mass circumcision was supposed to prevent sand from getting under soldiers' foreskins. 

They're all claims produced by medical experts and medical science, a field in which some researchers have been very eager to mutilate infant penises for some reason - or for *any* reason for that matter.

And as expected it didn't take long after the discovery of HIV for these guys to claim that the universal cure of circumcision would prevent it *somehow*. I'm not sure if it was Aaron J. Fink in 1986 who first came up with the idea as also Valiere Alcena has claimed bids on that. Yet still after almost 30 years the actual evidence for that assumption is lacking, and even quite the opposite as that more recent research shows.

true,ednorog,BULG,Bulgaria,"Ok, here's my view, have in mind, I am a resolute supporter of and frequent participant in these protests.

In short, we see the government as morally illegitimate to govern the country.

The longer version:

It all started by the government nominating [a media mogul](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/world/europe/after-political-appointment-in-bulgaria-rage-boils-over.html) with widely known mafia relations for head of the national security. I won't get into details but that was a move about as appropriate as nominating Kim Jong-un for head of the UN. That is just one, even if the most blatant, of a long series of completely unacceptable nominations which came right after the government was elected.

Besides, the two parties which formed the government actually do not have a majority in parliament; they have a total of 120 out of 240 MPs, so their votes would be insufficient. In order the government to remain in power, it relies on the nationalistic party ATAKA, which is an anti-European, anti-market, xenophobic, homophobic etc. party which builds its campaign mostly on hatred towards the ethnic minorities in the country, chiefly the Turks and the gypsies. Now, the most cynical thing here is, one of the two parties which form the government, the DPS (bg for Movement for Rights and Freedoms), is the unofficial party of the Turkic minority in the country (unofficial, because forming parties based on ethnicities is illegal according to the Constitution). So the government, which includes the Turkic minority party, is heavily dependent on the votes of a chauvinistic party which is chiefly known for its hatred to Turks, among other ethnicities.

What's more, about a week ago, the vice-chairman of the Parliament withdrew from all public positions he was holding because it became clear that he was to be prosecuted for money-laundering and tax evasion. He is the second most important person in the party in question, DPS. 

Furthermore, the main party in the ruling coalition, the socialist party BSP (which directly inherited the communist party in the early 90s), has a very poor history of ruling the country. It brought the economy to a complete collapse in the 90s (I remember in 1997 when due to hyperinflation many people here were living on $3-4 a month!). BSP + DPS were also in power between 2005 and 2009 and there was raging corruption all over the country, which didn't get any better during the next government (2009-2013), so people are really fed up with those parties. Now the prosecution against the DPS head certainly isn't helping them to improve their image.

For the entire 24-year period of the so-called Transition here (from communism to democracy, from planned to market economy, from pro-Soviet to pro-EU orientation etc.) there has been an appalling lack of justice, with people in power being closely related, sometimes heavily dependent, on the so-called 'oligarchs', that is, the mafia. Many people have grown rich illegally while a huge part of the population, especially those in the countryside, older people and people from the minorities, are living in abject poverty. On the background of rampant corruption, no major public figure has been sentenced, while not a single person in the country doubts that there are many who deserve that. So there has been a general anger and mistrust towards the political class, which has slowly accumulated over time and now erupted. The spark was, as I said, the inappropriate nomination in question, but things here are much, much deeper. 

And, honestly, people in the protests are so appalled and disgusted with the governing coalition that it looks pretty sure that nothing short of resignation and new elections would be acceptable. For more than 5 months now there have been people in the streets every single day, by the thousand, and the protests gained new energy 3 weeks ago with the students joining in by occupying universities. I don't see this coming to an end anytime soon unless the government resigns. 

One more thing, most people are aware that there is currently no visible alternative. Of the 4 parties in parliament, BSP + DPS form the government, backed by ATAKA, and the 4th party, GERB - which is also the largest - was the one in power between 2009-2013 and has proven to be no less corrupt and incompetent than rest of them. There are some smaller parties outside of the parliament, ones which support the protests and have probably gained some popularity over the recent months but that would be far from enough to be able to play an important role. However, the way that I and many people here see things are that the current political class is like a tumor, and what urgently needs to be done now is to have it removed.

This year Bulgaria has seen the most intense national uprising in decades. Protests started in February and you can read more about them here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_the_Borisov_cabinet . The most shocking events in the protests were the series of self-immolations by desperate citizens https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Bulgarian_self-immolations. 

The resignation of the Borisov cabinet led to preliminary elections which resulted in a ""hung parliament"". More on that here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_parliamentary_election,_2013 . 

Public outrage reached its height after the appointment of Delyan Peevski, **a very  controversial** political figure, as the head of  DANS- the Bulgarian state security agency. After the Constitutional Court allowed Peevski to return to Parliament, students occupied the Sofia University, being followed several days later by universities accross the country. More on that here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_the_Oresharski_cabinet

In more recent news, the socialist and *centrist* parties BSP and DPS are shipping people from around the country by the busload to form counter-protests in favor on the current government. http://i.imgur.com/SUCBZns.jpg

&gt; Irish Housing bubble

""Gushing capital creating bubbles"" does not explain a housing bubble? No matter how good the regulation, if money is loaned haphazardly, it will create a bubble. And obviously the Irish government was myopically ecstatic at all the money rushing in, which explains why they allowed it. 

&gt; neither does in explain a stagnant Italy

Stagnant Italy is the result of loss of competitiveness because of the euro + tight monetary policy which isn't allowing it to escape the recession. The banks thing doesn't play a huge role in Italy, true, but the whole' ordo-liberalism/mercantilist"" thing does. 

&gt; a spendthrift Greece

Availability of cheap money doesn't explain a country going into debt? I'm not trying to say that Greece didn't make a mistake, of course it did. But it's obvious there's a connection. 

&gt; a dysfunctional spain

Now you're becoming vague. Who's to say that Spain's dysfunctional systems (whatever that means) were the most important factor in the crisis? Why not attribute it to the gust of capital that financed a real estate bubble? 

&gt; collateral damage that essentially is the Portegese crisis.

Well, technically all crisis-stricken countries can be considered ""collateral damage"", in a way. But Portugal sure is a not-very-competitive country that became over-indebted because of how the euro works. Not that different from everyone else.

You didn't cite any other sources besides that tweet so I decided to dig around a little and, according to [U.S. Energy Information Administration:](http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=oil_refining)
""A 42-U.S. gallon barrel of crude oil provides about 45 gallons of petroleum products. This gain from processing the crude oil is similar to what happens to popcorn, which gets bigger after it's popped. The gain from processing is 7%.""

Considering that and the following statistics for North America for 2012 (2013 statistics are not listed on the site yet): 

[Total Petroleum Consumption (Thousand Barrels Per Day)  in 2012 was  22,994.3 barrels per day.](http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=5&amp;pid=5&amp;aid=2&amp;cid=r1,&amp;syid=2008&amp;eyid=2012&amp;unit=TBPD)

Now, you could consider other types of liquid fuels, but even adding them together, you get:

[Production of Crude Oil, NGPL, and Other Liquids combined (Thousand Barrels Per Day) in 2010 was 16,744.5 barrels per day.](http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=5&amp;pid=55&amp;aid=1&amp;cid=regions&amp;syid=2008&amp;eyid=2013&amp;unit=TBPD)

Looking at these, even while considering processing gain, this is nowhere close of North America being independent of foreign oil *at the moment*. Of course, it might be true for other kinds of energy products, such as gas, but those will not matter when considering fuel for transportation.

Simply answer this multiple-choice question to see if you are a *twat*:

Q: *Take a look at this picture and pick which penis would you like:*

http://www.moralogous.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/cutintact021.jpg

A. The pink healthy one on the right, where the super-sensitive glands of the penis is protected and lubricated by the foreskin (3.5 billion year of evolutionary development).

B. The brown one of the left with the keratinized (thickened) and dried-out glands, and the mutilated penile shaft - missing it's foreskin which is around 15 square inches in an adult male, 50% of the total penile skin, and has 20,000 nerve endings (fun fact: the female clitoris has only 8,000). Note, this is a picture of a ""successful"" circumcision. Ask me nicely, and I'll send you a load of pictures of circumcisions with ""complications"".

**Answer:**

The correct answer is A.

If you answered B, you are a **twat**. Your parents paid some quack doctor $500 (plus sales tax) to hack off the end of your penis and throw it in the hospital trash can.

And if you answered B, and you're proud of your mutilated, dried-out penis, then you are a **double-twat**.

**Bonus medical facts:**

Your female partners will have *""orgasm difficulties, dyspareunia (pain during or after sexual intercourse) and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment.""*

http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/13/ije.dyr104.short?rss=1

*Men with mutilated penises have a 4.5 times greater chance of erectile dysfunction then non-mutilated men &amp; have up to 75% less penile sensitivity - research from the British Journal of Urology International:*

http://news.menshealth.com/is-your-circumcision-making-you-soft/2011/11/02/

*Amputating the foreskin reduces the penis by 8mm (3/8"") in length and you've lost quite a bit of girth as well:*

They have not introduced any reforms and are only trying to fill in the cracks with money we don't have.

I feel the internet has another inherent fault, it is defined by confirmation bias, because all of the worlds information is available with little filter you are naturally attracted to sources that share or complement your opinions.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; The survey also shows a slight increase of traditional views, in particular in Eastern and Mediterranean countries. Asked if “we depend too much on science and not enough on faith,” 39% of European respondents agree, while 32% disagree and 25% are neutral. (Those with a lower level of education are more likely to agree with that statement.)  
On average, this is only a 1-point increase in the number of respondents who agreed compared with the previous survey, carried out in 2010. But this figure is on the rise in 17 out of 28 countries, including Bulgaria, where 66% of respondents agree that science takes too much precedence over faith—a whopping 14-point increase.

Here's the answers to the statement *""We depend too much on science and not enough on faith""* on a [map](http://i.imgur.com/9lObyOC)

I guess in addition to there being a correlation with religiousness in a country the rise since 2010 may also be attributed to people having a tendency of turning towards traditional views in times of political or economic uncertainty.

I was rushed for time, working even into the midnight hours of her birthday, so I had to cut out a lot of details and leave errors undone- including the credits and donations roll! I am working on them now and they will most likely be up by Sunday evening (in another video and description). But as of now I am telling her about each video and author personally. She can't stop crying. :) I *am still getting submissions*, so she'll have plenty to go through later!

Naomi and my brother (Tim, who speaks fluent German and has lived in Germany for a year or two) both work at the German School of Atlanta in my state. They see each other every Saturday and this is what he sent me. Also, a comment Naomi left on my status of me announcing her gift. :) Definitely more to come, and I'm sure I'll see her before the day is over.

The root word ""Slovo"" meaning words, language or speech on the other hand is. And ""Nemtsi"" still means both mute and German in pretty much all Slavic languages.  And Germans and Slavs are ancient neighbors. So it makes sense Slavic peoples would describe other people they can understand as speakers. And people they can't understand as some kind of ""mute"".  The full etymology http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Slav&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 indicates the Byzantine borrowed the proto-Slaivic root *slověne from surprise, surprise Slavic peoples. The Greek bastardization then made its way into Latin and later French and English to mean slave.

another catch: if you get less than 7% you are not eligible to get party support money from the state. so the big gets bigger; the small diminishes. 

so in countries like romania and turkey establishing an officeless party like piratpartiet is not possible. 'mocracy!

I never claimed you hated Romanians, I said your post history made it seem that way. I remember numerous times during our discussions when your attitude towards Romanians was quite negative. 

&gt;You assume that I hate Romanians without knowing what my post history is?

We've clashed on a number of issues before and I'm going by memory here since the alternative is having to go through my post history and find said discussions, something which I'm unwilling to do because it's a time consuming and pointless activity.

&gt;Clearly he has deep hatred towards Hungarians, he even says it himself, the only reason why he cares about this issue is because one side is Hungarian, so he naturally supports the other side.

OneRichBastard's comments exemplify the fear held by many Romanians of Hungarian revisionism and what is seen as attempts by Hungary to middle in its neighbouring country's internal affairs. The reason he feels so strongly about this issue is due to an inherent misunderstanding of the situation in Transylvania regarding the hungarian minority present there. For example, a lot of Romanians believe the hungarian minority wants to declare its independence, similar to what happened with Kosovo. 

The comments you linked do not espouse the claimed hatred towards hungarians by OneRichBastard. 

&gt;He doesn't even care that Romania does this exact same thing with Romanians, if it's Hungary that's doing it, then it's a dick move.

As I've pointed out to you before, the two situations are not comparable.

&gt;And you're probably blinded by something, I'm not sure what, perhaps it's paranoia, perhaps you're a nationalist yourself, but you can't tell him to fuck off, and instead here you are arguing with me and making up claims about how I hate Romanians.

true,Quebe,IREL,Ireland,"If the power of the one ring is to represent class dominance then it's destruction is very much our goal, the end of all class relations is the ultimate goal of all Socialist endeavors. 

And a reminder class in this sense does not simply mean rich or poor, it means what broad role you play in the production process, in the current society we have only two classes that of the Workers and that of the Capitalists, the goal then is to have a society in which all people are both workers and capitalists and neither, the relation between people would simply be of camaraderie.

While having the workers pool their wealth in order to combat the corruption of the state may be a short term solution to improve living standards it will never work for long, firstly the workers are too many to organize for such a long period through donations, secondly even our combined wealth is dwarfed by that of the Capitalists especially given we require a far higher percentage of our income to survive than they do, and lastly there is an issue of those countries outside the West who are being manipulated into complacency by the Imperialist might of the Empire's center, the US, from it's military twice the size of the next five armies below it combined or from it's deep control of international trade discourse.

Still this concept is similar to what we had in the Welfare State in Europe and the New Deal in the US, after mass movements are growing support in the Communist Socialist and Unionist movements which grew incredibly large in the 30s led to in the US of FDR making a deal with his upper-class colleagues (as he himself came from that background) to compromise with these movements in case what happened in Russia spread here, the result was the highest tax rate in US history and the implementation of various social policies and institutions such as social security and the Labour relations act.

There was a split between those who supported FDRs appeasements and those who wanted no part in them, this split would define the divide in US political parties to the present day between the Democrats and the Republicans.

This brings me to the actual issue of trying to make the system work for us; the 20th century project of the Republican party had one goal in mind: The total destruction of the Socialist, Communist and Union movements, and they succeeded.

Through infiltration by the FBI, to widespread propaganda, to the McCarthyist purge of any Leftist groups on the false basis of allegiance to ""the Enemy"" all Labour supporting groups were crushed, and thats why Socialism is a dirty word in the US today despite a good chance your great grandfather was waving the red flag at one point, today only 7% of US workers are Union members.

And with that over time we've had all of the progressive policies of the New Deal chipped away in the US with the Welfare State crumbled in all but Scandinavia in Europe (but even they are quickly losing ground) and this is the problem with accepting reformism though it will improve the conditions of people in the short term it will always be eroded back, it is not until we take power and through it's democratization destroy it will we end this endless process.",0,1384625379,null,0,false,0,cdfrv0o,t3_1qltvu,t1_cdfrv0o,t1_cdfm3td,null,1428635266,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

""Depuis 4 ans l’Atelier Juxtapoz œuvre pour le développement des cultureS urbaineS, c’est dans la continuité de son action et grâce à l’émergence du street art à Marseille que l’association Juxtapoz veut mettre EN place Le MUR-Marseille.
 
 
Chaque mois l’association propose à un artiste urbain, d’investir un panneau de 3 m X 5 m installé à l'angle de la rue Crudère et du Cours Julien dans le 6 ème arrondissement de Marseille. Il s'agit d'oeuvres éphémères. AcryliqueS, encres, aérosols, collages, ou performanceS en direct, les modes d'intervention sont libres et multiples. Le MUR s'inscrit dans une démarche artistique souvent mal connue, celle du street art ...

LE DEROULEMENT
L’exposition reste 30 jours et est soumisE aux aléas de la rue et de la météo. L’œuvre évolue dans son environnement, ce qui permet de conserver le coté brut et originel. Elle est offerte à l’espace urbain et ne peut être ni récupérée, ni conservée par l’association. Chaque œuvre participe ainsi au cycle temporaire d’exposition, et est recouverte par la suivante QUELLES QUE soit les techniques employées.
Une fois la performance finie, un vernissage est organisé pour présenter l’œuvre au public.


LA DIRECTION ARTISTIQUE
La direction artistique est assurée par les membres de l’association et l’artiste est sélectionné sur dossier. L’association met un point d’honneur à représenter toutes les disciplines de l’art urbain contemporain, tel que le pochoir, le collage, l’acrylique, la photographie… ou encore la bombe aérosol. L’association accompagne l’artiste tout au long de son processus de création et lui laisse carte blanche sur la réalisation de son œuvre.
 

LA PRODUCTION DE L’OEUVRE
L’association Juxtapoz offre deux possibilités à l’artiste pour la réalisation de son œuvre.
Soit il peut travailler directement sur le MUR et réaliser une performance en direct, soit l’association lui met à disposition un espace de 65 m2 dans son atelier situé dans le 5° arrondissement de Marseille. Une fois l’œuvre finie elle sera installEE sur le mur par l’artiste avec l’aide des membres de l’association.
La liberté est ainsi laissée à l’artiste d’agir dans l’espace public comme il le souhaite, par la performance ou par la réflexion en atelier.


LA PROGRAMMATION
L’association Juxtapoz veut proposer une programmation artistique de qualité ou toutes les disciplines de l’art urbain contemporain seront représentées. Elle veut mettre en avant les artistes et leur donner de la visibilité.
 
Depuis 1 an 6 performances onT PU être réalisées avec les artistes, RUSS, AMO, RIPO, TCHAD, LAMO, FAT POCH, GAMO, MARTA KA ....

LE PUBLIC
Le MUR-Marseille appartient à l’espace public, les œuvres exposées sont donc à la vue de tous, chacun peut y avoir accès, les passants comme les habitants du quartier, les commerçants, mais aussi les professionnels de l’art, les institutions et les aficionados de l’art urbain contemporain.
Ainsi, le public n’a pas besoin d’avoir la démarche d’aller dans une galerie, c’est l’art qui se propose à lui. Le MUR permet d’intégrer l’art urbain au quotidien du public, de lui permettre de s’approprier le territoire, en somme de donner l’envie de redécouvrir la ville autrement.
 

LES OBJECTIFS
Le MUR-Marseille a comme objectifs : de promouvoir l’art urbain contemporain à Marseille, de mettre en avant les artistes locaux, de proposer une programmation artistique de qualité, de donner de la visibilité aux artistes, de favoriser les rencontres entre des artistes locaux et de renomméE internationalE, de proposer un lieu culturel ouvert à tous et pour tous. De plus, l’association veut permettre l’institutionnalisation de l’art urbain en offrant aux artistes un cadre légal d’expression.""",0,1384625444,null,0,false,0,cdfrvt4,t3_1qqau1,t1_cdfrvt4,t1_cdfcxp2,null,1428635256,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

I have lived abroad for a long time, and I always heard anecdotal evidence that people get paid to join protests, but I never realized how blatant the whole thing was. He just matter of factly stated that he was going to go to Sofia with some transportation the party provided and he was going to be paid this and this much for that. I guess people are so disillusioned with the whole political system - it's doesn't matter who is in power; it is the same shit anyway - so they just take the highest bidder and attend their protests.

Because I disagree with you doesn't mean I automatically hate Romanians. And in every occasion when I've attacked Romania's policies towards Hungarians I always tried to point out that there already is a solution for example in South Tyrol, that Romania should learn from other models, and this is when I get attacked and downvoted.

&gt; OneRichBastard's comments exemplify the fear held by many Romanians of Hungarian revisionism and what is seen as attempts by Hungary to middle in its neighbouring country's internal affairs. 

You have Hungarians in Romania enduring insults, they go over the border and tell their relatives what assholes you guys are... those relatives will vote for parties that promiss to do something about it. Do you see the solution to the problem? 

In the future it should be the EU who should interfere in Romania's internal affairs, but I think that will only happen once the economic crisis is definitely over.

&gt; a lot of Romanians believe the hungarian minority wants to declare its independence, similar to what happened with Kosovo. 

I don't see it happening since the two communities are too much integrated. In Kosovo the Serb and Albanian community was very segregated, as in if you're a Serb you're never going to have Albanian friends, neither communities speak each others' language, and girls are escorted so they wouldn't get attacked.

But let's assume that the situation is the same, that Hungarians and Romanians hate each other so much you wouldn't even enter a shop if you knew it was owned by a Hungarian. In this situation - which would lead to a genuine desire for separation - why would it be a problem if the Hungarian region wanted to go independent now, in the 21st century?

&gt; As I've pointed out to you before, the two situations are not comparable.

I don't remember and I still disagree, it's the exact same situation. Do you think the Hungarians in Romania feel it's great that Moldovans are getting Romanian citizenship? I think they don't care, and this is what Romanians should do about Hungary's citizenship law: not care.",0,1384626901,null,0,false,0,cdfsect,t3_1qn066,t1_cdfsect,t1_cdfqpdz,null,1428635016,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

On a separate note, I don't think these companies are at fault for paying bribes when they are demanded; it's just the cost of business. I don't understand the anti-business sentiment in regards to corruption. A business is never supposed to act in anything but it's own interest and if a politician demands a bribe, you pay it, simple as that.

He was fined $8000 under the provisions of Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (non-judicial punishment). He also received a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR) which effectively ended his military career. 

&gt;**Lieutenant Colonel Steven L. Jordan** became the highest ranking officer to have charges brought against him in connection with the Abu Ghraib abuse on April 29, 2006.[56] Prior to his trial, eight of twelve charges against him were dismissed, two of the most serious after Major General George Fay admitted that he did not read Jordan his rights before interviewing him in reference to the abuses that had taken place. On August 28, 2007, Jordan was acquitted of all charges related to prisoner mistreatment and received a reprimand for disobeying an order not to discuss a 2004 investigation into the allegations.[57]

&gt;**Specialist Charles Graner** was found guilty on January 14, 2005 of conspiracy to maltreat detainees, failing to protect detainees from abuse, cruelty, and maltreatment, as well as charges of assault, indecency, adultery, and obstruction of justice. On January 15, 2005, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, dishonorable discharge and reduction in rank to private.[58][59] Graner was paroled from the US military's Fort Leavenworth prison on August 6, 2011 after serving six-and-a-half years.[60] 

&gt;**Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick** pled guilty on October 20, 2004 to conspiracy, dereliction of duty, maltreatment of detainees, assault and committing an indecent act in exchange for other charges being dropped. His abuses included forcing three prisoners to masturbate. He also punched one prisoner so hard in the chest that he needed resuscitation. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, forfeiture of pay, a dishonorable discharge and a reduction in rank to private.[61] 

&gt;**Sergeant Javal Davis** pled guilty February 4, 2005 to dereliction of duty, making false official statements and battery. He was sentenced to six months in prison, a reduction in rank to private, and a bad conduct discharge. 

&gt;**Specialist Jeremy Sivits** was sentenced on May 19, 2004 by a special court-martial to the maximum one-year sentence, in addition to a bad conduct discharge and a reduction of rank to private, upon his guilty plea.[62] 

&gt;**Specialist Armin Cruz** was sentenced on September 11, 2004, to eight months confinement, reduction in rank to private and a bad conduct discharge in exchange for his testimony against other soldiers.[63] 

&gt;**Specialist Sabrina Harman** was sentenced on May 17, 2005, to six months in prison and a bad conduct discharge after being convicted on six of the seven counts. She had faced a maximum sentence of five years.[64] Harman served her sentence at Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar.[65] 

&gt;**Specialist Megan Ambuhl** was convicted on October 30, 2004, of dereliction of duty and sentenced to reduction in rank to private and loss of a half-month’s pay.[66] 

&gt;**Private First Class Lynndie England** was convicted on September 26, 2005, of one count of conspiracy, four counts of maltreating detainees and one count of committing an indecent act. She was acquitted on a second conspiracy count. England had faced a maximum sentence of ten years. She was sentenced on September 27, 2005, to three years confinement, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, reduction to Private (E-1) and received a dishonorable discharge.[61] England had served her sentence at Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar.[67] 

&gt;**Sergeant Santos Cardona** was convicted of dereliction of duty and aggravated assault, the equivalent of a felony in the US civilian justice system. He served 90 days of hard labor at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He was then transferred to a new unit where he trained Iraqi police.[68] Cardona was unable to re-enlist due to the conviction, and left the army in 2007. In 2009, he was killed in action while working as a government contractor in Afghanistan. 

&gt;**Specialist Roman Krol** pled guilty on February 1, 2005 to conspiracy and maltreatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib. He was sentenced to ten months confinement, reduction in rank to private, and a bad conduct discharge.[69]

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;Because I disagree with you doesn't mean I automatically hate Romanians.

Our disagreements have nothing to do with it.

&gt;And in every occasion when I've attacked Romania's policies towards Hungarians I always tried to point out that there already is a solution for example in South Tyrol, that Romania should learn from other models, and this is when I get attacked and downvoted.

I believe I have pointed out why such an initiative would not work in Romania, at least not for the time being. 

&gt;You have Hungarians in Romania enduring insults

If you believe hungarians in Romania are being discriminated against then feel free to point out specific examples. As it stands, hungarians have the right to propagate their culture and language. Isn't that the main reason why hungarians in Romania ask for autonomy? 

&gt;they go over the border and tell their relatives what assholes you guys are... 

Just like OneRichBastard, you have a gross misunderstanding of the situation in Transylvania.

&gt;those relatives will vote for parties that promiss to do something about it. Do you see the solution to the problem? 

I do not believe that is the case. Nationalism has always been particularly strong in Europe.

&gt;In the future it should be the EU who should interfere in Romania's internal affairs, but I think that will only happen once the economic crisis is definitely over.

Why would the EU risk violating the sovereignity of one of its member states? Has Romania committed abuses against its Hungarian minority?

&gt;I don't see it happening since the two communities are too much integrated. In Kosovo the Serb and Albanian community was very segregated, as in if you're a Serb you're never going to have Albanian friends, neither communities speak each others' language, and girls are escorted so they wouldn't get attacked.

I don't either, but that's not what the majority of Romanians believe. Hungarian nationalists don't help either, since what they want is seen as attempted meddling. If Hungarians want to improve their reputation to Romanians outside Transylvania they should probably attempt to clarify the autonomy ordeal and what autonomy would mean if it were to be granted.

&gt;But let's assume that the situation is the same, that Hungarians and Romanians hate each other so much you wouldn't even enter a shop if you knew it was owned by a Hungarian. In this situation - which would lead to a genuine desire for separation - why would it be a problem if the Hungarian region wanted to go independent now, in the 21st century?

Would Hungarians agree to part of their country declaring its independence? 

&gt;I don't remember and I still disagree, it's the exact same situation.

Romanians constitute a majority in both Romania and Moldova. Hungarians, on the other hand, do not constitute a majority of Romania's population and considering the historical ethnic tensions between Hungarians and Romanians in Transylvania this law is seen as an attempt at internal meddling by Hungary in Romania's internal affairs. No country appreciated meddling and the recent protests against the dismantling of chemical weapons in Albania shows us that much.

true,quiditvinditpotdevin,null,null,"Yes, that's how it works. Yes, it's a bit stupid.

Actually it makes sense for most people because they don't change place of the time, so you end up paying the whole year every year. It makes the job simpler for the tax calculation.

It's also not too bad for French people that move around, because you simply always pay one time per year, in the city where you legally were on January 1st.

But when you take your own place for the first time, or leave the country mid-year, it's indeed a bit stupid.

So yeah, the rule is that you always pay for the place where you are legally on January 1st.

If you move in on January 2nd, the previous guy has to pay (or the owner if nobody rented it on that day). If you move in a shared house, it's a dick move to do that, because the others will have to pay your part (unless you already are in France and pay it somewhere else for that year). But even then, legally you're not obligated to pay anything if you don't live in France on January 1st.

If you want to move in on the 2nd to avoid the tax, you need to clear it up with your owner. It's the owner who declares who lives in. It's simple to round the date to the 1st if the guy moved in some furniture on that day or the next day. And you can expect that the owner isn't going to accept; maybe you can find an agreement with him to pay only the time you stay.

Also, note that what's important is the date where you move in. Not the date at which the rent starts, or the contract is signed. Also, technically, it's the whole day of January 1st from midnight to midnight that counts. If your stuff is in anytime on that day, you owe the tax. By ""your stuff"", I mean ""if it's enough to be considered liveable"", so if you can live in there decently but don't, it still counts.

PS: this tax pays for all the stuff you take advantage of in the city. Common transportation subventions, city services, garbage collection, subsidised sport installations, street cleaning, road work, free festivals… So on a moral point of view, you use that tax. 

You can ask the previous guy for the amount, it's typically in the few hundreds euros. It depends mostly on the city (bigger and more services is more expensive), the part of the city (richer, better equiped and closer to the center), and the surface. Note that if you don't have any revenue, or a very small one, it can be reduced a lot or even cancelled (but I'm not familiar with this).",0,1384630156,null,0,1384631551,0,cdftlm9,t3_1qrtjz,t1_cdftlm9,t3_1qrtjz,null,1428634455,9,false,france,t5_2qhjz,9

Pour cette caste, l'altérité est une valeur en soi, un objet de consommation, un trompe-l'ennui. Les Noirs doivent nous apprendre à voir l'autre. Connaître des Noirs, c'est s'ouvrir l'esprit. 

Marie Darrieussecq, dans son cheminement initiatique, ""découvre"" l'autre absolu, le Noir, et la culpabilité. Marie Darrieussecq découvre qu'elle en a besoin pour faire corps avec ses confrères anti-racistes. Ils sont unis dans leur amour du Noir et de l'étranger. Les défendre est leur mission, les aimer est leur devoir, les côtoyer leur pénitence. 

Mais Marie Darrieussecq ne comprend pas. Elle ne comprend pas qu'imposer son point de vue, c'est subordonner la condition noire à la bienveillance de sa caste. C'est refuser qu'on puisse se considérer irréductiblement noir dans un pays irréductiblement blanc et ne pas vouloir à tout prix le métissage. Car le métissage d'une classe dominée, c'est l'acceptation tacite de son inexistence ou de son illégitimité comme communauté intégrée mais aussi à part dans le corps social. Être Noir, c'est une expérience qu'on ne peut ni partager, ni diminuer, ni renier tout à fait.

Et ça, Marie Darrieussecq ne le supporte pas. Si les Noirs ou les Maghrébains avaient une altérité qui lui serait interdite, alors elle se retrouverait rejetée en arrière vers sa famille basque, ces vieux réac qui votent à droite. Elle a besoin de son statut de Noire honorifique pour échapper à leurs griffes, à leur emprise. Comme si vivre auprès de leurs opposés ( dans sa tête ) la mettait à l'abri. Être Noir, c'est être la conscience de Marie Darrieussecq, un talisman, une caution, un gri-gri.

true,AgentGotse,BULG,Bulgaria,"Good answer overall. First a disclaimer : I didn't vote for GERB on the last elections -- I voted for a party that didn't enter. 

I disagree with your assessment that GERB is equally as corrupt as the BSP + DPS. BSP + DPS are far more corrupt than GERB. I remember perfectly well that an enormous part of the EU funds were frozen during the 2005-2009 government when BSP + DPS were in power. Funds were frozen because of rampart corruption. When GERB came into power, all EU funds were unfrozen and the money started flowing in again and continue to do so until they stayed in power. Now, it was exactly **yesterday** when the EU started freezing EU funds again. This government has been in power for like 6 months and they already managed to fuck up some of the EU funds. I am sure more will follow.

Also, the current government has the lowest approval rating of all time, except for the BSP government in 1997 (when protesters stormed parliament and kicked them out). In just six months in power, their ratings managed to fall below what GERB had when they resigned . Тhat's amazing. No other government has managed to lose trust this fast. I think that is indicative of how much more corrupt the BSP + DPS is rather than GERB.

Also, all of the corruption scandals that I can recall from the current BSP + DPS government and the former 2005-2009 DPS + BSP government are orders of magnitude worse than what happened during GERB's time.

That said, what I want to see in the next parliament and government is a coalition between GERB + Reformist block, because ... there's nobody else and fuck the BSP + DPS, both parties are full with communists and were created by the communist party.",0,1384637481,null,0,false,0,cdfwc3y,t3_1qr6u2,t1_cdfwc3y,t1_cdfncxg,null,1428633115,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Parliaments then have a second opinion on the budget their government is proposing. 

But they can't do anything in case of noncompliance at that stage.

For eurozone countries that are under excessive deficit procedure, they can be imposed progressively sharper penalties (interest-bearing deposit, non-interest bearing deposits, conversion to a fine, extra fines) upon noncompliance. That's the already established albeit newish 6pack procedure. Though they still can't force them to a particular policy - though I don't think anyone could climb out of the excessive debt fast enough for the penalties not to be prohibitive.

Anyhow, these countries are prob breaking their own laws now, since they had to transcribe a limit to structural deficit as a constitutional amendment or framework law, under court of justice verification of that transcription, under the fiscal compact.

But so far the EU, with Germany at its core, has only forced Southern and Eastern Europe to be financially like the west. But it made no effort to force a working judicial and police and legal system on us. So in reality even the apparently western financial discipline in Greece was fake. And while the national financials in Romania and Bulgaria are not fake, pretty much everything else is ruled by crime and corruption.

So when you come, make sure to bring all of your effective systems with you, not just low inflation and debt.

The prince who ruled these lands was elected by the Sultan. The election was simple: the person who was able to give him the largest sum of money, got the job. Then the newly-elected Prince would try to get as much money out of his rule as possible in order to recover his investment and get some profit. 

To do this, he tried to maximize his incomes. For instance, he sold every public job at the highest bidder. These public jobs were always generating their own income, so these people also tried to get as much money as possible.
