However, I understood the situation (about France at least) to be a bit more complicated than that. ~~Would the president want to protect Snowden, he would not have the power to do so.~~

~~First, asylum is granted by an independent court and current laws say we would have to deny Snowden asylum because officially, USA is a democracy with fair tribunals.~~

~~Second, Snowden is, officially, suspect of a crime, and even if not judged yet, he admitted he committed a crime (treason). Current treaties being what they are, the French police has to arrest Snowden and extradite him.~~

~~So, if we want our countries to remain countries that apply their own laws but still want to help Snowden, we have to change our current laws. The idea of creating a whistleblower status is interesting. It could work a bit like free speech.~~


EDIT: Actually a French lawyer blogger, [Maitre Eolas](http://www.maitre-eolas.fr/post/2013/07/05/Non%2C-la-France-na-pas-refuse-lasile-a-Eward-Snowden) made a detailled explanation (in French). Here is the summary : this lawyer who has a lot of experience in asylum laws says that Snowden would probably be granted asylum if he made the demand. Asylum decisions are taken by a special court independent from the government. However, to do that, you have to be inside of France (the embassy doesn't work). France recently denied his visa demand to make asylum demand. Visa demands are managed by the interior minister. Those are totally dependent from the power. There are precedents of France granting asylum to American artists during the MacCarthy witchhunt, so this is totally possible.

For the record, note however that I am perplexed by the fact that Snowden, who revealed things that were widely known, who did so by clearly illegal means, who collaborated with CIA and NSA for a long time and who is liable by US laws, is receiving more support than Assange, who did a journalist job, taught us things we really didn't know (yes, major newspaper did talk about the less interesting factlets), worked to force transparency during all his life and did nothing illegal does receive far less support.

Obama wird zu seiner Rede eingeflogen, vor ausgewähltem Publikum natürlich, damit bloß niemand negative Plakate hochhält und dem großen, mächtigen Amerika ans Bein einen *falschen* Eindruck bietet...  

Was ist passiert in den letzten Jahren? Als ACTA das Thema war gab es gefühlt überall Demos zu denen die Menschen in Massen erschienen sind... Wenn man den Medien glauben darf, sind die Leute doch in überwältigender Mehrheit gegen PRISM und Konsorten, aber wo sind die Demonstranten jetzt? Warum kein ""Occupy US Embassy""? Was ist aus Deutschlands Wutbürgertum geworden das in letzer Zeit so in Mode gekommen ist? Es gab zwar ein paar Demos, aber bis auf eine handvoll Leute scheint da niemand gekommen zu sein, in meiner Stadt gabs auf jeden Fall keine.

Das Volk hat sich anscheinend daran gewöhnt, dass die USA machen was sie wollen. Guantanamo gibts ja auch immernoch, obwohl von wirklich überall die Kritik kommt. Seit seiner Wahl redet Obama fröhlich davon Guantanamo zu schliessen, bei seiner Rede in Berlin hatte er das immernoch im Programm. Da fragt man sich ob er entweder lügt, oder eigentlich nur eine PR Fassade ist, wie ein König in einer demokratischen Monarchie.

Europa resigniert im Angesicht der größeren Macht, könnte man sagen. Am Ende sind wir wohl doch nichts anderes als die Satellitenstaaten der damaligen UDSSR, nur gehören wir zur anderen Seite. Mir gefällt dieser Gedanke nicht wirklich, aber irgendwie gibt mir das Verhalten der Europäischen Regierungen eben das Gefühl da sei etwas dran.

Oh und dann gibt es noch den großen Haufen Leute die meinen ""Deutschland (o. andere Europäsche Länder) überwachen doch genau so, das ist so seit es Geheimdienste gibt!! Wenn du was anderes geglaubt hast bist zu ziemlich naiv!!"" Meint ihr wirklich das sei überhaupt ein Argument? Wenn alle etwas ""böses"" machen, wird es dann gut? 

Wenn es wirklich so ist, dass ""alle Länder"" großflächig und ohne Beachtung der Grundrechte die Bevölkerungen anderer Länder überwachen (nennt mich naiv wenn ihr wollt, aber ich glaube nicht ganz daran), dann braucht es am besten noch ein paar weitere Snowdens, aus möglichst vielen Ländern. Erst dann gibt es vielleicht ein Umdenken in der breiten Masse, dann ist nichtmehr das ""große, böse, unantastbare Amerika"" der Schuldige, sondern alle. Ob Amerika oder die ganze Welt, es muss sich etwas ändern, und selbst wenn Amerika nicht alleine schuldig ist, so muss man doch trotzdem irgendwo anfangen!

1. Das Stammpublikum (ü60) bleibt fern
2. Das neue Publikum, welches seit Jahren keine ZDF Eigenproduktion mehr gesehen hat ist skeptisch undes wird einige Zeit dauern bis diese einschalten (bzw es sich rumspricht das die Serie was taugt). Gleichzeitig ist hier der Markt durch andere  Unterhaltungselektronik viel stärker umkämpft, so dass die potentielle Zuschauerzahl generell niedriger ist als bei der Ü60 Generation.

It's a biography of Richard Nixon, and a long one, but it paints a pretty vivid picture of how modern xenophobic conservatism in the USA took root in the 50s and 60s as non-whites began cramping whitey's style. It made whitey very uncomfortable.  Some people got over it, but lots of them got very weird about it.  The current white racial-conservatives don't even, I think, really believe they're racists ... because they never actually talk about it in those terms ... it's always code.

true,marcoil,CATA,Catalonia,"It's actually way older than that, the problem is that it has become a very overloaded word, with two very different meanings. 

The ""original"" European meaning of nationalism came as a reaction to the formation on nation-states around the 18th century. As the modern European state was built around the idea of ""one state, one nation"" some cultural groups were trapped inside an state made by another group, and over the years they demanded a right to form their own state too.

This is still the way things are. As long as Europe is organized as a group of nation-states, there'll be people saying ""Hey, the French have their own state, why can't we?"". And believe me, for all the talk about European integration, it's still completely a nation-state club, as only those have seats in any EU institution. This is further compounded by the fact that almost no-one ever goes back. I don't think there's any proposal for re-integrating the Netherlands into Spain, for example. And I've never seen debates like ""Does Portugal really have a right to their own state?"".

And then... Well, thanks to the German Nacional-Socialist party, we have the other meaning, the one that most people interpret as ""I think my country is better than yours"". As a political philosophy, it's one of the easiest to demonstrate that it's wrong, but this is the meaning that most people think of when they hear ""nationalism"", specially in English culture. The milder version of this is called ""banal nationalism"", and it's present everywhere nowadays. There's an excellent book by Michael Billig about it, highly recommended. 

The second meaning is so pervasive now that Catalan politics are advised to use ""separatist"" or ""independentist"" instead of ""nationalist"" when speaking to international press.

TL;DR: ""Nationalism"" is old, but it's not always an aggressive, racist political philosophy.

true,anirdnas,SERB,Serbia,"Yes, well things are more complicated than that. Romania looks at things too narrow. Vlachs don't identify themselves as Romanians (you can see that on all polls they either declare as Serbs or Vlachs), and that is why they refuse to accept romanian language themselves. Vlach language is some kind of old archaic dialect so literal romanian sounds very different to us, like a really different language even though  probably 90% of words are the same, I guess, but some grammar and pronunciation is different. So for example now they are trying to make their own language called Vlach, which is kind of ridiculous, but you have to understand that they have never been part of Romania and can't identify with romanian language, so they would rather invent their own language, especially because of the pressures. Also, we were never part of romanian church, why would we be now? Most requests for romanian church come from romanian nationals who married  in Serbia, but most of the Vlachs don't wan't it. Serbia can't force some other language and religion on its own people, because they internally don't want it. Problem with Vlachs is that they never had their own intelectual elite which would build their identity, so they nationally feel as Serbs, and Romania, until now was never really interested in them. Even now Romania is only interested to lump them all as Romanians even though they have some distinct pagan customs and words, which is a shame Romanians are not interested in, because it explains their history as well. 

Here is a link to Vlach dictionary in progress: http://www.paundurlic.com/vlaski.recnik/index.php

Also interesting book about the customs: http://www.scribd.com/doc/78866919/Sacred-Language-of-the-Vlach-Bread-illustrated-book-and-dictionary-in-40-pictures-Paun-Es-Durli%C4%87

Serbian orthodox church fiercely tries to block romanias church for their own reasons, it shouldn't be confused with how Vlachs feel. 

As for neonazis, don't know, maybe there are some, they are everywhere, but it is not that prevalent.

Do I? I think we have different opinions on strength. My view is that we need a common foreign policy, a non-interventionist one in my opinion.

&gt; [...] separating at a lower level seems a bit silly to me.

Not at all. The USA are doing just fine with fifty states, considering they are a dominating economic, political and military power. Germany is constituted of 16 states, too, and we are doing relatively fine, as are Austria and Switzerland. A strong federal EU entails necessarily a subsidary principle: The smallest political unit that can viably deal with an issue should do so. Now I can't accept that France and Malta are equally capable of solving issues traditionally solved at a national scale. Neither do I believe that the solutions in the 16 states of Germany are equally applicable to all of us, so we have our country sliced up nicely.

Ich denke, dass Venezuela Snowden nicht aufnimmt, weil er ein großer Held ist. Nein, man möchte den USA möglichst öffentlich ans Bein pinkeln. Dagegen habe ich auch nichts. 

Ich behaupte, dass das große Problem ist, dass sich für die meisten Bürger nach der Enthüllung des Skandals nichts geändert hat. So platt es klingen mag: denk an S21, plötzlich verschwinden echte Bäume, die vorher da waren und schön waren im Park. Oder die Occupy Bewegung. Auch hier waren die Demonstrierenden unmittelbar betroffen von der Krise. Oder SOPA/etc. wo befürchtet wurde, dass Gewisse Webcontents in Zukunft nicht mehr verfügbar sind. Was Bürger auf die Straße treibt, ist was sie unmittelbar und materiell/physisch betrifft (Steuern, Fluglärm, Etc.)

Aber jetzt... Die Situation hat sich für die meisten Bürger faktisch nicht verändert. Ihnen wurden nicht ganz direkt Güter entzogen (letztendlich natürlich schon, aber eben nicht im Sinne eines materiellen Entzugs). Natürlich, gut ist das ja alles nicht... Aber was hat sich an meinem Leben geändert, außer dass ich jetzt bescheid weiß?

Diese Einstellung ist auf gar keinen Fall zu begrüßen und das ""Ich hab nichts zu verbergen"" ist ein gigantischer Mittelfinger in Richtung Aufklärung, Demokratie und Autonomie. Darüber könnte ich mich endlos aufregen, aber nicht jetzt.

Ich wollte nur versuchen eine Erklärung dafür zu finden, warum der Wutbürger bei einem solchen Skandal nicht auf die Straße geht. Ich denke ist liegt daran, dass nicht etwas materielles unmittelbar bedroht ist, wie oben ausgeführt.

I mean, you see doctors not getting paid for overtime, wages cut 30-50%, all public investment scrapped, benefits and pensions cut but you refuse to call this austerity and are asking for more. You are either delusional or a sadist. 

&gt; Just as a suggestion, if anyone tells you that the best way to get out of debt, is to go into debt, be skeptical. 

This is an institutional, mechanism design sort of problem. The way public spending is defined now is similar to how a firm or household define it. But this need not be so. Money is just an abstract logistical mechanism we use to make our lives easier. 

If solving the crisis requires a state to ""go into more debt"" in logistical terms, that's not the same thing as a household getting a new credit card to pay off their old one. You are comparing apples to oranges. 

Also, it's funny that you say that. The current response to the crisis has been nothing but getting into more debt. Greece, Portugal et al. are forced to receive impossible to repay loans to service their previous debts. Let me guess: your ideal would be for the crisis-stricken countries to just do austerity on their own without being given any loans at all, right?

It's probably the GEZ and they probably want you to pay money. Since you are only there for 3 months in the summer you really shouldn't worry about it. Ignore the letter for now and they might not even send you a new one before you leave.

""Buergerinnen und Buerger"" translates to citizens, however it most definitely also includes all legal residents, they don't necessarily have to be German. IIRC that doesn't include visitors on extended visitor visas. I am pretty sure that you have to have sort of a resident status in order for them to be legally collecting money from you. Are you registered at the city hall? If you are, it's true, they could have gotten your information from there. 

I have also heard a lot about a [scam letter] (http://mkenyaujerumani.de/2013/03/30/beware-of-the-gezzdfard-scam-sent-per-post/) that looks like a letter from the GEZ, so you gotta be really careful with that. 

If you are not sure you should ask your German friends at school or a professor to check it out for you, unfortunately I don't live in Germany anymore so I don't know what an actual GEZ letter looks like but I'm sure any other German could help you with this.

TL;DR: Ignore it, it's most likely not gonna be a big deal since you are in Germany on a visitor visa and it might even be a spam letter...

&gt;E visto che le loro culture hanno influenzato poco la nostra 

Ma scherzi? Vabbe con la Russia non abbiamo tanto da fare. Pero la Germania? Insomma noi con loro siamo vicinissimi. Dopo la caduta dell'impero Romano il Nord italiano e' diventato la nuova casa di numerose tribu' tedesche. Se tu sei veramente Emiliano o Romagnolo devi sapere che il sangue tedesco e' molto presente nelle tue venne. Come fai a dire che non abbiamo niente da fare con loro? Infatti c'e' una regione italiana con la maggiranza tedesca. E tutti in Trentino Alto-Adige sono miei connazionali. A Milano la chiamano cotoletta alla Milanese e a Vienna schnitzel. Stessa robaccia. Gli italiani e' i tedeschi hanno una storia grandissima insieme. La Seconda guerra mondiale? Mai sentito di Balilla? Noi siamo stati parte dell'impero austriaco. Loro sono stati nel nostro Impero Romano. Siamo stati insieme nel Sacro Impero Romano. E tu mi parli degli americani. Che cazzata!

&gt;ma possiamo negare la nostra società sia formata in gran parte ad imitazione della loro

E questa cazzata da dove te la sei inventato/a? Sono loro che hanno assimilato la nostra cultura. E' stato un'italiano a scoprire America. Loro sono i piu grandi consumatori di pizza e pasta. Si, vabbe, guardiamo i film americani. Io non vedo in che modo la nostra societa sia formata ad imitazione della loro. Il mondo e' creato in imitazione dell'Europa e sopratutto dell'Italia.

&gt;Che gli americani siano figli di emigrati e deportati, può essere vero... ma anche se fosse? Chi se ne frega? Cosa cambia? 

Centra e poi centra molto. Noi siamo il popolo che ha cambiato il mondo per il migliore mille volte. Senza di noi non ci sarebbe la civilta' occidentale. Sono loro che devono vedere noi come se fossimo superiori. Noi, che siamo rimasti qui, siamo i frutti piu belli del giardino. E questo vale per tutta l'Europa.

EDIT: Sai, hai ragione-le culture della Russia o della Germania non li conosciamo abbastanza bene. E' vero.

That actually could have produced better results than giving endless bailout programs, some direct and some veiled like the ECB buying endless amounts of bonds from secondary markets.

The thing is that crisis-stricken countries stricken because they had major problems on how their societies and economies worked. If there would have been no bailout programs what so ever, these countries would have had to default and people would have had to face consequences of their choices and beliefs. This of course could and probably would have caused major social upheaval...

But then again, there will be major social upheaval in crisis-stricken countries anyways as they are very late on preparing themselves to face the next crisis - pension and generational crisis - which in my opinion they haven't prepared at all. If there isn't a social and ideological change in crisis-stricken countries to adopt more entrepreneurial and market friendly policies and debunking of statism, these countries will face increase of poverty and misery and as their economies and societies ways of working can't support non-functional and ruinous policies.

When a company depends almost entirely on the government, and that company backs loans, then one possible consequence is more capital will enter that market than would naturally.

Also, the Community Reinvestment Act mandated that loans be given to risky individuals.  This was the design of the CRA, and was seriously implemented in the mid 90's and was carried out well into the Bush years.  Alan Greenspan incentivised risky lending by offering bailouts to any company that went sour.  To think that this can happen without disastrous results is just downright silly.

For crying out loud, it was not too long ago when the was [Spiegel article](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/italians-flock-to-berlin-to-join-flourishing-start-up-scene-a-903908.html) about Italians flocking to Berlin to start their companies there. Public sectors in these countries were are choking the private sector.

* In Spain the state and politicians let the property bubble build up because that was the only sector that was growing, if the Spanish economy would have been more free, there would have been lots of other industry sector that would have provided alternative sources of growth. Not to mention that when the property bubble would have collapsed, these other industries could have absorbed some of the workforce, but as the public sector choked the private sector, there was no alternative industries to take replace the gap that construction industry left.

* In Portugal there was really to bubble nor any growth before the crisis, and that was the problem. Their whole economy was frozen and after the financial crisis they couldn't anymore keep their facades up with loan money. Essentially the same story in Greece, however in Greece the size and amounts of money were in another league.

* In case of Ireland the Irish state hired and spend like there was no tomorrow before the crisis. Even if the Irish state had not bailed out their banks, they would still have needed to endure major reduction to state activities.

Now the reason why these countries haven't shown any kind of improvement in recent years... That isn't actually true. For example Spanish export companies are exporting now more than they ever have. The thing is that there was so much dead weight in the economy that it takes years before new growth and growth drivers can match it. Not to mention that crisis-stricken countries really haven't freed their economies, the state is still to rigid and inflexible, choking the private sector little less, but choking it still anyways.",0,1373133974,null,0,false,0,cax3sd9,t3_1hqs0k,t1_cax3sd9,t1_cax3b6z,null,1430563876,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

You simply have no evidence that the activity of the public sector had any negative effect on the private sector and you have no way of proving that this is was a reason for their economic crisis.

I know all these things about the specific problems of the Spanish, Portuguese and Irish economy, although I'm not sure about that last bit about Ireland. Nevertheless, why are you even saying all this stuff, I didn't ask you ""what problems did these countries have before the onset of the crisis"".

That's cheery picking your statistics and you should know it. Besides, it's obvious that internal devaluation will lead in increased exports, that by itself proves nothing. We're talking about an improvement in the lives of the Spanish people here.

Perhaps if the CAP stopped to *actively discriminate us* which the CAP has been doing since 1995- and we have complained about it. Not that the EU care about what is right, or actually about science


If you think all we do is bitch, can you then please tell us how we, with 9 million people can get the EU to actually start being reasonable and not have a CAP that is far to big. If the EU actually *wanted* to change, the CAP would not be so fucked up (please, subsidising wine and tobacco and discriminating the north, and that just for starters).It has been for years and we have been trying to change it but 9 million can't do it alone. 

And - all the time we have, and are discriminated against. All the EU want is our money, not to change. If you want to change- why haven't the EU changed the CAP?  Also, if the EU actually cared, why is not the EU following the rules, and trying to do what is right? Why in God's name have you accepted no one bothered to follow the Maastrich criteria. Are you expecting the 9 million of us to be some sort of police to 60 million France, who couldn't even be bothered to follow them, and for the record, still doesn't. Why did one even accept Italy, Belgium and Greece in the Euro.

For God's sake - we are net contributors unlike most of the countries in the EU. We have wanted reforms, for ages. We are in top five of implementing laws and we saved our own bloody banks, twice, not bitching about it, and we demanded collateral for it too. We are not one of the countries  who has fucked up, and we have been saying the same thing since 1995. The fact that no one listens and that you bitch about us instead of attacking France for the CAP for example says all about you, and nothing about us. Grow up and take some responsibility. If you had listenend to us, you would not have been there. The latest of failurse (apart from the CAP) is when you *now* all of a sudden realise that a bank save needs collateral otherwise you are wasting tax payers money. Anders Borg, our minister of finance, has been saying that to you, since 2009. The EU didn't care, and how many banks did you save withouth collateral, wasting tax payers money? How many? Why did you ignore him?  Of course we do not want to be involved in something as reckless and stupid like that - and then you blame us. Instead you should perhaps ask yourself why the EU do not care about tax payers money. 

Bitch-please. We do take our repsonsibility, but you do not. You want our money, but actually changing is to hard for you I guess - otherwise you would have. You put yourself in this position, and now you can't even man up to fix it properly or the multiple mistakes. You are not even trying to change, at all. Instead, you blame it on a country with nine million people. For fucks sake, grow up.  ",0,1373138281,null,0,false,0,cax52og,t3_1houtu,t1_cax52og,t1_cax1bl2,null,1430563199,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Then you take countries that are not bankrupt and you ascribe them with non-statist qualities. You know how I know that? Because there's two of your austerians here. One is arguing that we should be more like the USA because they are not statist while the other is arguing that the USA was the source of the crisis because they were too statist. 

If you are willing to produce an objective measure of statist-ness and demonstrate a correlation between that and bankrupt economies, then I'd be willing to listen further to your argument. 

&gt; These points alleviate that there were major problems in all of these economies that were largely caused by the state. The reason why these countries didn't endure crisis earlier was because of the global economic boom that pumped money in to them. I think that it is wrong to think that it was the financial crisis of 2008 that broke this countries - no they were broken already, it was the financial boom that held them together, otherwise they would have gone broke before.

Oh, I agree that they were the weakest links, I don't dispute that. The problem is that if during the global boom all that money wasn't pumped into all these useless activities in these weak countries, then we'd be in recession the next day. It's the system that is broken and kept pumping money into useless stuff to kick the can down the road. 

&gt; Export of these Spanish companies are growing, that means that these companies will have more money and are able to thus invest and this will create more economic growth.

This has been going on with Greece since 2009. Exports have risen dramatically due to internal devaluation. However, the profits were not reinvested and there was no growth. I will let you work out why on your own. Are you at least willing to concede that this shows that there is a deeper problem at hand?

I will repeat this until it bores until all your heads. 

Just as all people in Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland are Scandinavian and all the people in Spain and Portugal are Iberian, the people of the British Isles are British.

The 'Great Britain' part refers to the largest Island in the British Isles, the one that holds England, Scotland and Wales, Scotland would still be on 'Great Britain' post-Independence, it's not like we're sawing ourselves off from the Island.

To further reiterate this point; the term ""British"" existed long before the Union of Crowns or the Act of Union. It's origins lie in the Greek word *Priteni* (The origin of the latin word Britannic) which was used to refer to the people of Great Britain and Ireland by both the Greeks and the Romans.

It's origins lie in the Greek word Priteni (The origin of the latin word Britannic) which was used to refer to the people of Great Britain and Ireland by both the Greeks and the Romans. 

Nobody is disputing that it's a geographical or historical term.

We're disputing Scotland's ability to hold onto a British identity when there will ALREADY be a British identity...held by BRITISH citizens (people from the UK of England, Wales and Northern Ireland).

If the UK was to break up entirely, then of course British identity would mean something else. It would then be used to refer to the countries of Britain, their surrounding islands and cultural activities 

Yet British people will still exist as a national group which the Scots will not be a part of.

You're completely deluded if you genuinely believe Scottish people will continue to refer to themselves as British.",0,1373144616,null,0,false,0,cax6xlf,t3_1hpwde,t1_cax6xlf,t1_cax6a06,null,1430562323,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

If they are indeed demanding that, then they are pretty clueless and lack a deep understanding of the German political system.

Article 38: “[Members of the German Bundestag] shall not [be] bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience.”

There is no legal duty for members of parliament to follow their party when voting. A member of parliament is free to vote however she or he pleases during her or his mandate. Parties have no avenues for sanctions in the parliament (i.e. they cannot, for example, prevent “rogue” members of parliament from their party from voting in parliament or remove them from parliament).

Now, of course, members of parliament still tend to fall in line with their party. This has many reasons. One obvious one is that they tend to share the views of their party. Another one is that there are so many issues voted on that it’s impossible to follow every single one and become an expert on every single topic, so it’s common (and probably good practice) to follow the recommendation of the party expert on that law who actually studied it in detail (and sat in committee when they law was discussed and modified).

Those two reasons seem entirely unproblematic to me. A third one could be a bit more problematic and preventing it from happening might be a possibility, but it would require deep changes to the political system that might have other undesirable consequences.

That third reason is that politicians depend on their parties. Many members are list candidates and they want the member of their party to put them on that list the next time, too. Direct candidates are less at risk and consequently generally actually do have more clout – but they generally also depend on at least local support of their party. Parties play an important organising role in German politics – and that role comes with power.",0,1373147177,null,0,false,0,cax7nwq,t3_1hp0kq,t1_cax7nwq,t1_cawgrmn,null,1430561979,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

And you are wrong. [Link](http://imgur.com/yRRnZT4). And the country that creates more businesses in 2010 was France.

However, I can call this business creation rate bullshit. It's mostly construction workers and Spain has been leader in the [business death rate](http://i.imgur.com/B7SiOwn.png).

The EU doesn't have that data in their website but I read that Spain was also leader in business death in 2011. And more business were started in Spain than in Germany.

But they didn't created jobs in the long term. Why? We are one of the countries with the biggest death rate in business. 90% of the business close in a year with high loses usually. Why is it happening? I can't answer that but you don't say two big problems that we have in Spain:

* If a client doesn't pay he won't have any problem. You can go to court and in 4 or 5 years the government will do something, perhaps. I don't know how to fix that.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; The Waffen SS were, however, a vicious branch of the German Military, tasked with, among all else, mass executions of the Jewish populace. 

The mass murder of the Baltic Jews was perpetrated primarily by the German-staffed *Einsatzgruppen*. In all three countries, the Germans encouraged a smaller-scale pogrom against Jews by native paramilitary groups in the days following the invasion in June 1941, then claimed that the Jews needed protection and herded the Jews into ghettos. Almost immediately thereafter, the *Einsatzgruppen* began mass killings themselves. In addition to the *Einsatzgruppen*, the Germans subordinated Baltic paramilitary groups (like the [Arajs Kommando](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arajs_Kommando) or the [Lithuanian Security Police](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Security_Police)) into the SS to help with the killing. The foreign ""volunteer"" groupings in the Waffen-SS were not directly involved.

What's more, the native Balts and Estonians were not even conscripted into the Waffen-SS until late 1942 or 1943. The bulk of the killing was done in the latter half of 1941 and 1942. The Waffen-SS groupings to which these Balts/Estonians were conscripted were used as part of the Wehrmacht to fight the Soviet Union's counteroffensive. The Germans saw the Baltic states as an area for colonization and refused to arm large numbers of natives until the need for manpower was so great that they reconsidered.

I have no love for Nazis, and there were plenty of willing Nazi collaborators in the Baltic states, but let's remember history in context. First, the context of World War Two: the Baltics were stuck between aggressive, expansionist neighbors on both sides. The Germans had (albeit cynically and only sort of) assisted the Baltic states in gaining independence from Russia in the wake of the first world war, while the Soviets had just re-annexed the Baltic states, having installed puppet communist governments in sham ""elections"" that demanded they be annexed by the USSR. There was no love lost for the Russians/Soviets.  And the context now is even more important: Germany lost the war, and the Baltics continued to be occupied by the Soviets for fifty years. After mass deportations and fifty years of persecution under the Soviet intelligence apparatus and colonization by Russians, resentment built in the Baltics against the Russians.

I said in my post that there were plenty of collaborators in the Baltic states. But the Estonian SS brigade was not (to my admittedly limited knowledge) involved in the Nazi mass murder in the Baltics. It was an army unit sent to fight against the Soviets.

&gt; I also find the notion of ""forced conscription"" to be questionable: you don't arm a large group of people (adds up to a couple hundred thousand across Estonia and the Baltics) and fully outfit them to be a combative force, unless you're fairly certain they won't use those same guns against you, especially if you're lacking in manpower to address a possible upheaval. It is therefore that I do not consider those people ""freedom fighters"", strictly speaking.

As I stated in my post, the Nazis did not arm the Baltic population until late in the war, displaying precisely the reluctance you describe. For one thing, the Germans believed that the Balts were racially inferior, while the Estonians were suitably Aryan-like, so Lithuanians and Latvians were not trusted with arms until the Germans had suffered such great losses on the Eastern Front that they could no longer afford to ignore the manpower reserves of the Baltic states. The Germans did not trust completely that the Baltic populations would not use their arms and training against Germany, but they did not believe that they had any other option. 

&gt; The French resistance were quite uncompromising, for instance. The Finns genuinely fought for their freedom. You don't see them hold yearly gatherings where any sort of Nazi-related symbolism is being flaunted like it's cool, however.

The French resistance was large, but it was always a minority of the population. Both the French government and the French population at large was willing to acquiesce to German demands so long as they need not suffer more war. And again, the French and the Finns had only one enemy to fight. Nobody in France had to choose between the fascist or the communist flavor of mass murder or forced labor. It's simply not that clear-cut.

I think you're much too willing to make this a black-and-white issue. We have to judge historical personalities by their historical context. The Baltic states were pressed between aggressive states from two sides. Both sides were terrible and committed mass murder and mass deportation. Both sides refused to countenance independent Baltic states. What would you have done? 

I think that in this particular instance it would have been better for a less important government official to recognize the group, because of the connection between the Waffen-SS in general and Nazi crimes against humanity, but I would not judge the Baltics too seriously for their position.",0,1373184962,null,0,false,0,caxhqqx,t3_1hrlop,t1_caxhqqx,t1_caxhgrw,null,1430557158,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

I think my point boils down to this: a country with a murky past, as far as WW2 is concerned, should not attract additional attention to it by endorsing those groups on a very high official level. While you would not judge the Baltics, many Europeans I imagine are rather less lenient when it comes to any Nazi Germany associates. It is especially poignant now that Estonia is within the EU, and should ideally subscribe to the same ideology.

About the meaning I have two hypotesis:

1 - The TINO is the bin used to prepare wine (vat?), adding the suffix -etto makes it smaller, basically tinetto means a small tino, tinetti it's just the plural. 

2 - Tino is a common nickname for many names, like Costantino, Valentino, Albertino, Martino etc... so Tinetto could just mean son of Tino or related to an ancestor named Tino. Many Italian surnames are diminutive of names, like Marcellini (Marcello), Paoletti (Paolo), Antonelli (Antonello), Antonini (Antonio-Antonino), Meucci (Meo-Romeo), Matteini (Matteo), etc...

a quote from [this website](http://genealogy.about.com/cs/surname/a/italian_surname.htm) explains, better than how I did, how Italian surnames work:

&gt;Suffixes &amp; Prefixes
 
&gt;Many Italian surnames are basically variations on a root name, made different by the addition of various prefixes and suffixes. Especially common are endings with vowels enclosing double consonants (e.g. -etti, -illo).The Italian preference for diminutives and pet names is the root behind many of the suffixes, as seen by the large number of Italian last names ending in -ini, -ino, -etti, -etto, -ello, and -illo, all of which mean ""little."" Other commonly added suffixes include -one meaning ""big,"" -accio, meaning either ""big"" or ""bad,"" and -ucci meaning ""descendant of.""

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Just accept that you can not get what you want every time.

It is not about getting what we want every time. It is about being rules by common sense. 

A brilliant example are the bank saves. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_banking_rescue) and [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/business/worldbusiness/23krona.html?_r=0) are two articles about the Swedish banking crises of the 90's. The Swedish bank saves are generally seen to be exemplary, and actually *made* money for the citizens at the end of the day, even though at one time we paid more than 4 % of our GDP for our banks. Also, we had some trouble in the 2000's, so Sweden know bank saves.


So, when the EU asked us to participate in the (first round) of bank saves we were cautiosly somewhat optimistic (remember, just before we had contributed to bailing out Ireland, just like you want us to). Also, bank saves is an area we unfortunately know very well :-).


However, instead of doing what had worked very well for us (and Finland) and what all the text books and common sense said you should do the EU decided to basically just hand over money.

When we saved our banks (which one should) we said ""No save without collateral, i.e. shares)"". Also, ""perhaps not every single bank, save the ones important to the system"". So, the Swedish bank know that they will be saved (most likely) but it will cost them ownership. The Swedish tax payer know that their money will be spent on the bank, but we will gain ownership. Also, it conveys something important to the banks - the world is not risk free. If you take to much risks, they might fail. 


The EU bank save were obviusly the opposite. No collateral/no shares. Indiscriminently saving all banks, + just transferring the risk quitely to the tax payers, and they have received nothing for it. That is what the EU has been doing since 2009. It is so idiotic, and such an insult to the tax payers. What more, you teach the banks that the world is completely risk free. 

We said that, time and time again. I remember Anders Borg (our minister of finance), explaining exactly to the German journalists, why it was a bad idea. Did you listen? 


Of course, the EU went ahead, doing the worst bank save in history.

We tried, we really did, but if the EU decides to be that reckless, and that idiotic with the money, we want nothing to do with it. Why should the EU banks be treated like little babies, and the tax payers get nothing? 

I think the people of the EU should ask this, and hold your politicians accountable (there was *no reason* for such an idiotic bank save, none), We tried, we really did, but we can't change the hundred millions of you if you decide to throw money at bankers, which you did. Apperently the people of the EU feel differently, the Germans for example are re-electing Merkel who organised the whole thing, and you are bitching about how things are Sweden's fault. 

Grow up. We have. We know we can't change the several hundred millions of you and we see how you solve crises and how you use tax payers money (and we tell you) but nine million Swedes can't change you, unless you decide to actually act. The only thing we can do is to stay as far away from the debacle as possible. 

I am very glad we didn't participate in the bank saves. Why should France's banks get my money, without collateral, and why should I shoulder their debt, why are their banks risk free - ours isn't. 

So, explain the bank save to me. Why did you do the most idiotic bank save in history? Why one earth should anyone participate in that, let alone someone who doesn't even ned to? Why don't you hold your politicians accountable? 

&gt;Just ignore the parts where you lose and focus on the parts where you win. 

No, not if the loosing part is discriminating (like the CAP), goes against science (like sponsoring tobacco) or ignoring science. 

I obviously understand that one can't get everything one wants in negotions, but the EU should be rules by common sense and a respect for science. Those should be underlying features, just like a respect for democracy and human rights. At no point should one country be able to negotiate away human rights for example, or, scientific results. 

Sweden is being actively discriminated in the CAP. How can you defend discrimination of a country/region? The EU is all about not doing that, but apparently it does not count when it comes to the CAP, the single biggest post of the budget. If you were a normal person,you would be horrified by discrimination I guess, but instead you bitch about us not giving more money.  Instead, why don't you complain about the fact that the EU is discriminating? Why complain at us? Why not change the CAP instead? Do you support discrimination? Why should we give money, or more, to an organisation that actively discriminate us? 

Also, how can you defend going against science? Who the fuck, apart from the EU is so stupid, that you go against science? I want the EU to a much larger degree, to be ruled by science (where one can of course). Apparently the EU does not like science, otherwise there is no way one sponsors tobaccor for decades, sponsors alcohol etc. So, instead of asking why the EU is actively against science and try to change that, you blame the Swedes for not wanting to participate. Newsflash, we like science, that is why we are one of the biggest spenders of the EU on research. 


&gt; Its not like Sweden is dying of poverty.

What sort of attitude is that. Sweden is not dying of poverty, so you think the EU should spend our money - completely recklessly.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons we are no dying of power, because we hold our politicians accountable, and they are trying to be responsible. Why aren't you? Can you please explain to me why the banks saves were done in the way they were? Why don't you hold your politicians accountable for that? Instead of bitching about us, hold your politicians accountable instead.

You are always putting the blame outside of the core, outside of Germany/France/Euro area. Instead of asking why the EU and the Euro area are constantly making such shitty deciscions, and why the politicians can get away with it, you put the blame outside. Newsflash,we are trying to change it, we tell you every single time that it should be done better or differently. Then the EU  ignores it, goes on to do something idiotic like the bank saves, or worse, an idiotic CAP that we have to pay for (thanks for letting me participating in sponsoring alcohol and tobacco, really). Then you bitch about us not participating more. 

Frankly, why don't you listen and/or stop doing idiotic stuff. I am grateful our politicians didn't participate in you stupid bank save for example. The Euro area seem to throw money away completely recklessly, and have a complete disregard for accountability and common sense. I tell you that. Sweden tells you that. We don't want to throw money away the way you do, so we stay on the sidelines. 

Of course, you could ask yourself why your politicians are throwing away money, why no one is held accountable, why there are no rules, etc,and why that is not changing. Instead, you bitch about us not wanting to give you more money to throw away. I can guarante, until *you* actually start actively changing and holding *your* policians accountable, nothing will. And that has absolutel nothing to do with Sweden, and all to do with you, the way you approach things, and the EU. So, stop bitching and start changing insted. We can'do it for you.

Based on the dimensions of a pack of 50, a 1oz pack of Fritos has a volume of 734ml. Portage from the US, based on USPS' ""Priority Mail® International Large Flat Rate Box"" (edit: [link](http://ircalc.usps.com/MailServices.aspx?country=10137&amp;m=6&amp;p=4&amp;o=0)), is €4.68 per liter, or €3.44 for a 1oz pack.  
If you bought two of those 1oz packages at this vendor that charges €6.60 for shipping you're already very close, and for three or more you're better off ordering from there. 

Keep in mind that this is already based on the assumption that you make ideal use of the cheapest cost per volume from the US (that I could find), and a rather expensive way to buy them in Germany. On the other hand, they weight almost nothing, so if you have enough space left in the package, by all means, throw some in there.

Btw., weight. Let's do some math with that. This time, I'll base my calculations on the *medium* flat rate box, which is more efficient for this purpose at $59.95/20lbs. That's $0.19/oz or €5.20/kg.  
Let's say we want to ship jars of Skippy peanut butter. We want ""super chunk"", which is a bit more expensive than creamy, and we opt for the 16.3oz jar. Based on the price for a pack of six at Amazon.com, the German vendor charges €2.67 on top of what it costs in the US, which is about the same as shipping from the US when you allow the remaining €0.27 for the weight of the jar (again when you make perfect use of the 20lbs weight allowance of the flat rate box). This vendor *does* charge €4.90 for shipping within Germany, which makes it more expensive, but on the other hand, they also have most of the other stuff people talk about here, like those Fritos you like, but in a more reasonable package size.

tl;dr: Shipping from the US is expensive as fuck.

German unification in 1870/71 is a much better example  than 1989/90. There were different states whose population was arguably as diverse as Francophone vs Anglophone Quebecoix (-oises?), though much less than  
Canadians of African/European/Asian descent. The Kingdom of Prussia was nearly as dominating as English language in all of Canada. Well, not really that much, but many people felt that unification was effectively succumbing to Prussian rule. 

Yet state legislature was still rather far-reaching (as long as it did not restrict industrialisation under capitalist rule). For instance, you couldn't acquire German statesmanship up until Nazi rule, only Bavarian or Schaumburg-Lippe or whoseever statesmanship.

The notion of a nation, if you pardon the pun, was rather a thing which originated in the 19th Century, possibly to construct an excuse to found larger entities which were economically more viable, specifically in Germany and Italy.  One might argue that all the German states giving u their independence were part of one greater people. However, back then there was no doubt that Austrians are part of the German people but today this idea would be laughable.

At the expense of 60 million dead people and half of Europe under the iron grip of the USSR. If WW2 ended the colonial empires then the trade off certainly wasn't worth it. Either way, the European empires would have ended regardless of whether WW2 happened or not. 

&gt;and after the USSR crumbled we ended up with substantially more European countries than before.

WW2 is the reason the USSR managed to extend its sphere of influence over half of Europe. 

&gt;Those few points alone make a compelling case that WWII was beneficial to Europe..

If WW2 had any beneficial consequences on Europe then they were restricted to Western Europe.

This was the last week of a parliamentary session, so a lot of the news this week has been last-minute parliamentary business.

* A special investigative committee looking into how the management of the Housing Financing Fund handed in its report. This fund is owned by the state and intended to finance both the purchase and construction of homes. According to the report it's lost the equivilent of ca. € 1.7 billion since it was set up in 1999. The fund is meant to be self-sustainable and the losses seem to be mainly the result of the incompetence of top managers and board members, as well as significant political interference. This is all closely linked to the housing bubble in the years leading up to the economic crisis.
* Wikileaks and the Icelandic company DataCell are suing payment processing company Valitor for ca. € 50 million damages after Valitor (under pressure from VISA) stopped donations to Wikileaks through DataCell several years ago. The supreme court recently ruled that Valitor had acted illegally.
* The parliamentary minority put forward a bill to grant Edward Snowden citizenship. The majority blocked the bill going to the relevant parliamentary committee for discussion.
* Parliament accepted some very controversial changes to the way fisheries pay for the right to fish. Essentially it's a question of how much the state should charge for the use of such an important natural resource. The changes will ensure that the companies need to pay much less than under a law put in place by the previous government and meant to come into force this year. 15% of the electorate has signed a petition to the president to refuse to sign the new law. If he does not sign the law would go to a referendum, and according to polls 70% of voters would reject the new law.
* The area in which whaling is banned (essentially a whale watching reserve) was made smaller, to the dismay of whale watching companies.
* A new law came into force on the appointment of the board of the national broadcaster, RÚV. Now the board is appointed by the political parties again, which is how it was until the last government changed it to being appointed by various different organisations.",0,1373196620,null,0,false,0,caxj7up,t3_1hsp1k,t1_caxj7up,t3_1hsp1k,null,1430556462,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Still, you can see a copy of the ""incorrect"" journal in the [Museum of Occupations](http://okupatsioon.ee/en) in Tallinn. : )

That verdict, however, was good enough for the US to deport Linnas to the Soviet Union. This also illustrates why the Supreme Court decision cannot be used as a moral platform - in their naivety, North American courts relied on Soviet evidence that was often nothing less than forgery. See [Soviet Evidence in North American Courts: An Analysis of Problems and Concerns with Reliance on Communist Source Evidence in Alleged War Criminal Trials](http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/B000BY4ZC4) for many more examples.

In short, the author doesn't have a clue of Estonian historiography, nor of issues related to post-WW2 mock trials in Eastern Europe. As far as war crimes go, here are valid topics, such as the actions of Ain-Ervin Mere (he was one of the accused in the mock trials of 1960s) and of [*Omakaitse*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omakaitse), but these topics are limited to the civil administration and their auxiliary units, and have very little to do with front-line units like the 20th Estonian Waffen-SS Division.",0,1373198243,null,0,1373198591,0,caxjes9,t3_1hrlop,t1_caxjes9,t1_caxiyak,null,1430556371,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Have you looked into the Deutschland Pass? It's valid for 30 days and quite cheap.

&gt; Do the prices change closer to the date?

Yes, book early if possible. But see below for alternatives.

&gt; Will buying a ticket from the station be more or less expensive than buying in advance online.

I believe there's a low extra fee if you buy at a counter, but generally the price is the same at the counter, ticket machines or online. Only depends on the date you buy. 5 minutes before departure won't get you a good deal

&gt; Are there any other cheaper alternatives to buying tickets through that site?

Try bahn.ltur.com, they have tickets for as little as 26 eur if you book last-minute (up to a week till departure).

&gt; What is the cheapest way to get from Paris to Berlin.

Probably flying - should be less than 100 eur.

In general, the longer you book in advance, the cheaper the ticket is. Though you can sometimes get cheap last-minute tickets from http://www.ltur.com/de/bahn.html

&gt; Are there any other cheaper alternatives to buying tickets through that site? I'm happy to consider bus or night trains etc...

Night trains can be booked via bahn.de, too, but are often more expensive than day trains. Bus travel is cheaper, though, and so are Mitfahrgelegenheiten (carsharing).

I'm afraid it's not going to get any cheaper than that, unless you're willing to consider absurdly long travel times.

If needed, they'll produce their own ammo, no matter what we do. And if they don't need tension, they'll even [make a deal with Hitler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact). That's politics. Don't be naive.

&gt; The fact is, anything associated with Nazism is very much frowned upon in all major European countries.

It isn't, really. To give the clearest example - tehnically, Finland was an ally of Germany in [Continuation War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation_War), but it would be an utter nonsense to claim that there was anything wrong with what the Finns did, or that they fought for Hitler's cause.

There was an immense number of participants in the conflict, and everyone had their own goals. After the red terror in Estonia in 1940-1941, the most important goal for Estonia was to keep the Soviet Union out of its borders, in the hope that the German retreat from the Eastern Front would cause a power vacuum [just like had happened in 1918](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_War_of_Independence#Course_of_the_war) in the aftermath of WWI, allowing to restore the Republic of Estonia. It is **vital** to know the history of Eastern Europe between 1917 and 1920 to understand what goals different participants had in WW2. 

From this point of view, those who fought on the Eastern Front (especially in [the Battle of Narva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Narva_%281944%29), on of the bloodiest of the whole WW2) are no doubt heroes, much like they are heroes from the Finnish viewpoint - the battles in North-Eastern Estonia gave Finland [enough leverage to find a way to peace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation_War#Soviet_strategic_offensive).",0,1373199721,null,0,1373199998,0,caxjlox,t3_1hrlop,t1_caxjlox,t1_caxizew,null,1430556281,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

You are also defending Karl Linnas. Now, Karl Linnas was, inarguably, in charge of a concentration camp. The soviet system might have had it's problems as far as judiciary aspects are concerned (to put it mildly), but falsifying a major fact as **being in charge of a concentration camp** isn't viable. As far as I know, there weren't any particularly kindly and pleasant concentration camp commanders. I don't know why I even bother arguing this point.

Fact is, if Europe is to argue a point to Russia, it needs to be morally unquestionable. Estonia and co. are complicating things. You can say that, yes, Russia will find a rhetoric that suits it no matter what. But you aren't helping, are you?

&gt;It isn't, really. To give the clearest example - tehnically, Finland was an ally of Germany in Continuation War[2] , but it would be an utter nonsense to claim that there was anything wrong with what the Finns did, or that they fought for Hitler's cause.

Copying my other comment:

""Finland was a distinct country that, while allied to Nazi Germany, didn't partake in the nationalistic antics, giddily rounding up Romas, Jews to be executed. Even though Finland wore the swastika, it didn't quite mar itself with the ideology.
It also benefits, in the public's eyes, from being a definite underdog in the situation.""

I'm not. I am illustrating that both the author and US courts relied on unfair trials and fabricated evidence. Everyone deserves a fair trial, especially those who are guilty of the most serious crimes - so that their guilt couldn't be lessened by appealing on unfair trial.

&gt; being in charge of a concentration camp

It wasn't a ""concentration camp"" in Hollywood sense of the word, but a temporary prisoner camp. According to research, the vast majority of its occupants had been participants of so-called destruction commandos (*hävituspataljon*) and deserved to be shot, about 230 were killed in total.

The camp became famous after a Soviet investigator multiplied the width of a anti-tank trench used for executions by the length of it, and assumed that 12 000 had been murdered there. Soviet propaganda spinned that figure of 12 000 around until the very collapse of the country.

Linnas' role in the camp remains relatively unknown, since until the collapse of the Soviet Union, unbiased research was not possible. After the collapse, research has been seriously hindered by the lack of trustworthy evidence. So I hope that you don't mind me being surprised by foreigners who know so well who-did-what. 

Merely ""guilt by position"" is not good enough for me.

&gt; The Omakaitse members were also involved in very questionable acts. Those people then went on to become a part of the SS Division.

Since you seem to know this so well - how many Omakaitse members were guilty of any crimes, and how many of them were drafted into 20th Division? Out of 15 000-20 000 men in the 20th, how many had innocent blood on their hands?

Even if everyone who had anything to do with crimes were conscripted, they would've still not constituted more than 7% of 20th Division's manpower. The correct figure is likely smaller by an order of a magnitude.

You're clearly stretching this too far.

&gt;  As far as I know, there weren't any particularly kindly and pleasant concentration camp commanders.

Then your knowledge is limited. There were sadists like Roland Lepik (of Tartu camp), who was executed by his own people, and then there were commanders, who allowed Soviet POWs to work on farms, and thus escape camp conditions - one of such POWs was the current chairman of Russian veterans' organization in Tallinn, and in a recent documentary he expressed his gratitude.

You also seem to be particularly picky on whether to accept facts and sources that do not fit your exact version of what happened.

Snowden leaked (most likely parts of) what's going on and no government involved wants to talk about the details or was clear about them before the leak. That's the achievement which may well have to be attached to the name Snowden.

So if this case (which isn't over yet) showed folks something, it might be along the lines of 'demand answers from your government and decide about whether those answers are true'.

I'm not contradicting.

You seem to posess a very Hollywood-esque view on a prisoner camp. Random people weren't rounded up and shot. I am merely pointing out, that:

* There is evidence that the vast majority of prisoners took part in the coup in June 1940, or were guilty of large-scale destruction at the time of a war, and to a varying degree, of murders of civilian population. Their execution was the right thing to do from both legal and moral point of view.

* There is no evidence that Karl Linnas participated in extrajudicial killings or any other crimes of that sort.

For certain crimes, the normal mode of operation of a prisoner camp is to carry out executions. Being in charge of such camp is not a crime in itself, like you seem to suggest.

&gt; No, I do not. Neither does the author of the book that I linked to, by his own admission. It is preposterous to request this kind of information, and you know it, of course.

Preposterous? It isn't. That information is actually publicly available in English, in one of the major publications on this topic.

Crimes were commited by about 1000 persons, 1200 tops, who working for the civil administration. Civil and military branches didn't mix much, and like I pointed out - even if we assumed that everyone of them served in the 20th Division, they wouldn't constitute more than 7% of the total manpower at any given time.

So what are the remaining 93% guilty of?

&gt; I believe, however, that it was highly likely that Nazi sympathisers would end up in Nazi regiments.

Crimes commited had nothing to do with Nazism, it simply had no supporters and the local SD archives are littered with [Martin Sandberger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sandberger)'s whining on the subject, especially with regard to the inability to instigate pogroms.

In every major city in the US crowds gave up their holiday (July 4) to protest NSA spying. If similar (or worse) programs in Europe only stoke anger at the US, I am sure European governments will view that as a license to continue doing whatever they want, and in all fairness, why wouldn't they see it that way.

Their execution was the right thing to do from both legal and moral point of view.

The contradiction was in you demanding fair due process for Nazi criminals, as it's ""everyone's right"". You then claimed that it was basically good for people to get rounded up and shot in the head -- which contradicts your first statement about due process.

As for Linnas and his innocence, there seem to have been those who [thought otherwise](http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-02/news/mn-3165_1_death-sentence). It's a shame that they didn't get shot, as they no doubt deserved. They went on to tarnish the reputation of such a great man as Linnas, and the unusually humane, squeaky-clean camp he used to run.

&gt; Mein Recht, von Religion nicht belästigt zu werden, wird jeden Tag verletzt.  

Sind wir immer noch beim Kirchengebimmel?  

Zunächst mal ist ""aber die haben noch was viel schlimmeres gemacht"" rechtlich überhaupt kein Argument, und meiner ganz persönlichen Meinung nach: gut so. Du könntest evtl. noch Verhältnismäßigkeit ins Feld führen: Die einen werden bestraft, die anderen nicht, aber wahrscheinlich müßtest Du auch dafür die mehr als geringfügige Beeinträchtigung 

Läuten zum Gebet ist durch die Religionsfreiheit geschützt, Uhrzeitläuten wird aber als säkulären Ursprungs angesehen und hat mit Religion nix zu tun, auch wenn's vom Kirchturm kommt. (--&gt;wikipedia)

Erstmal gibt es kein Recht auf generelle Belästigungsfreiheit, Sondern wieder nur ein Abwägen der Schädigungen. 

Ist voll in Ordnung zu hinterfragen ob einzelne Gesetze - wie das betreffende Feiertagsgesetz - noch zeitgemäß sind. Das Grundprinzip der Abwägung in Frage zu stellen - daß mein Recht, scheußliche Musik zu hören da endet, wo Deine Nachtruhe beginnt - ist, sagen wir mal, ohne alternatives Konzept ziemlich kurzsichtig.


**tl;dr:** Kirchgebimmel ist eiin unabhängiger Sachverhalt und wird i.d.R. ncith als ""religiöse Belästigung"" durchgehen, es gibt kein Grundrecht auf vollständige Belästigungsfreiheit,  am Grundprinzip der Schadensabwägung kommen wir ohne weiteres nicht vorbei.

The best information available indicates that those in Tartu camp (with few exceptions) were guilty of crimes punishable by death, and that Karl Linnas did not commit extrajudicial killings.

I am for due process in the sense that the right people get punished. I don't care how it's formally done. Is it really that difficult to process that among many forced labor and death camps there were camps that actually did justice by executing marauders and murderers?

&gt; I'd like to see you claim that the LA times were influenced by Soviets.

If you honestly believe that a western journalist could have talked to anyone in the Soviet Union in 1987 without the KGB vetting the person beforehand, then I am dumbfounded by your naivety.

There's a joke that the Viru hotel in Tallinn, which was used to accomodate westerners, was made of microconcrete - concrete mixed with microphones. A whole floor, which as a joke still officially doesn't exist, was packed with equipment to record everything that was being said and done (the floor was recently turned into [a museum](http://www.tallinn2011.ee/%27hotel_viru_and_the_kgb__museum_opens_on_13_january)). Everyone from prostitutes on the streetcorner to cleaning ladies were working for the KGB, and the visitors were traced wherever they went, and whatever meetings with locals they had were plays - carefully prepared for them. They were living in a false reality, and being constantly manipulated by everyone around them. ""Western journalist freely roaming around in 1987"" sounds like a joke in itself. : )

Ovviamente è difficile rispondere per qualcosa che ancora non ho vissuto ma è facile dire che un'assemblea orizzontale, la stessa che ha deciso queste ""norme"" è in grado di stabilire cosa è giusto e cosa non lo è. Ti ricordo poi che l'anarchia è unanimità, non certo maggioranza. Se qualcuno non è d'accordo si discute e si cerca di capire il perché.

Va detto anche che una persona non può sentirsi legittimata ad avere un comportamento autoritario, ad esempio uno stupro. Un comportamento del genere va soppresso sul nascere, perché è l'espressione di un autoritarismo che l'anarchia combatte.

I actual think that it could be beneficial if votes could (actually, not only in theory) come together based on topics itself and not along coalition fractions and questionable deals between the partys. 

It could certainly add some dynamics (I think the lack thereof is a big part of the increasing frustration and lack of participations in politics - which is exactly the group of people this party aims for...) and could open up some new possibilities on deadlocked topics.

1) Connect all points with their nearest neighbours so that no lines cross. You can do this either with a ruler and compass, or *eyeball* it. The latter will usually be good enough. The *eyeballin'* is a human heuristic for the exact algorithm, of which there are many. The easiest, but time consumiest, is connecting all points with all other points and where two lines intersect remove the longer^(1). If you have n points, that would be n! lines, of which you would remove most again. Not efficient. You should end up with only triangles if you do this right!


2) Bisect each of these new lines and draw a perpendicular line through the bisection point

3) Now there should be points where three bisecting perpendicular lines meet, and always and only three. If there is a point where more or less meet, some ambiguity in 1) was resolved incorrectly and you have to start over and flip a few polygons around. Note that only the close ""intersections"" matter. In a large Voronoi diagram the perpendicular lines will probably meet in pairs in some distant cell. That is okay, those are not relevant.

4) These points are the vertices of the Voronoi cells. If you remove those parts of the bisecting perpendicular lines from (2) that protrude into a cell, you are left with a Voronoi diagram

I made a very rough illustration, but I don't have good tools on the computer, so that this is the equivalent of a freehand drawing. The angles are probably all far from perpendicular, the points don't bisect, etc., but I think the illustration is still useful.

ad 1: I think that should work, I haven't proved it.

Back when the Government first went after him (in 2001), there were two main issues with deporting (or extraditing) him to Jordan; he might be tortured, he wouldn't receive a fair trial.

In 2005, the Government signed an agreement with Jordan that dealt with the first one, and then tried to deport him (this was after they'd had to let him out of prison following a UK court ruling that the law detaining him was incompatible with the ECHR). He challenged this decision, the first instance court (SIAC in 2006) rejected his arguments, but the Court of Appeal (in 2008) agreed that there was a risk he might not get a fair trial due to the use of confessions obtained through torture.

The Government then appealed that to the House of Lords (2009), where they won, but the ECtHR (2012) disagreed, I think on the basis of new evidence that the House of Lords couldn't (or weren't allowed to) consider. They found there was still a ""real risk of the admission of evidence ... obtained by torture.""

Theresa May seems to have mostly ignored this, and in 2012 tried again to deport him, he challenged the decision and SIAC (2012) sided with him, finding that the situation in Jordan hadn't changed enough to make deporting him legal. The Government appealed, but lost that fairly quickly (2013).

Outside the courts, though, the Government has been negotiating with the Jordanians (for all this time) to try to get them to fix their justice system (or at least, bring it up to the standards of a European court). The treaty ratified this week seems to have done that (at least, to Othman's satisfaction - he could have challenged this latest deportation), so without the risk of him getting an unfair trial, it is OK to deport him.

Now if only the Government had sorted this out back in 2001, they could have saved a lot of time and money....

Some details:

* Luis Barcenas, aka Luis El Cabrón, the treasurer of the spanish PP that was sent to prison recently has filtered more information to the press. He has made clear that the president of Spain knew everything and that the party has being getting funds ilegally the last 20 years.[Original Link](http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/07/07/espana/1373186360.html) [Brief Link](http://blogs.lainformacion.com/treintaymuchos/2013/07/07/los-nueve-titulares-apestosos-de-barcenas-en-su-explosiva-conversacion-con-pedro-j/)
* After the last cuts in R&amp;D the government said that is totally imposible for the government to give work to all the researchers, and that the obvious conlusion is the we should stop training  researchers and offering Phd. [Link](http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/07/05/ciencia/1373034430.html)
* The PP destroyed the registers that judge requested for the corruption prosecution. [link](http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/07/01/actualidad/1372701672_799917.html)
* Unemployment: the number of registered unemployees decreased in 127,248 persons. But, the number of persons that are registered as working increased in 26,853 only, the usual for June in this depression. [Link](http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/02/inenglish/1372766917_408817.html)
* The premier of Andalusia announced that this is his last term in office and that he is going to retire after that. This has happened whe the judge has published that has new data that connects him with corruption. [Link](http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/05/inenglish/1373023853_578939.html)
* Education cuts: The government applied austerity to the scholarships. This is old news. But an anonymous philanthropist has offered 70,000 euros to pay the enrolment of 50 students in public universities. [Link](http://www.ileon.com/universidad/030075/un-anonimo-pagara-la-matricula-de-medio-centenar-de-estudiantes-de-la-ule-que-no-puedan-acceder-a-beca). I try to find positive news. :) 
* Former socialist minister called in fraud prosecution. [Link](http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/02/inenglish/1372773123_235696.html)
* It's [San Fermin in Navarra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Ferm%C3%ADn)
* Richest man of Spain(and Europe) [found guilty of tax fraud](http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/07/inenglish/1373199221_096876.html): He needs to pay €33 millions only and he is not going to jail or anything. He was being prosecuted for the years 2001 to 2003. But, he has being doing the same his full life.
* Catalonia had a concert supporting the soberaninst process in the Camp Nou. [Link](http://www.catalannewsagency.com/news/politics/massive-concert-supporting-catalonia%E2%80%99s-self-determination-ignored-spanish-politicians)
* Catalan government creates a fake job for a leader of the youth of the soberanist ruling coalition. The job will have a salary of 50 000 euros  and consist giving advice when required to the government. [Link](http://www.publico.es/458241/ciu-coloca-a-un-dirigente-de-juventudes-sin-experiencia-como-asesor-de-la-consellera-rigau)
* Food banks retrieved austerity from the government and are having problems to get food for all the poor. The EU sent some food recently. [Link](http://www.diarioinformacion.com/alicante/2013/07/06/europa-envia-800000-kilos-alimentos/1392739.html)

About the food banks the EU after a petition of Germany applied austerity to that budget. The spanish government would need to increase his budget for them as compensation, but instead of that Spain applied also austerity to that. We are starting to have a big problem with the undernourishment of the poor. The problem is worse with kids because this will affect them their full lifes.

They might not be vocal about it, they might be more neutral than you'd like or think of it as a secondary matter, they might have a ""what can I do about it"" mentality, and let's not forget they might have to deal with the crisis right now (the immigration laws were the no1 subject in political talk right before the crisis if you can remember, but everybody put it aside once the news about the IMF broke out), so the thing is I wouldn't call those people racists or hypocrites, and if you are to put dividing lines like that (especially with the current setting of the crisis and the Golden Dawn) it's not going to help. 

I think it's more wise to try to make racism look something so absurd and inane that normal people wouldn't even think of following it, than to more or less try to prove that ""even normal people can be easily racists"". Cause the racist leaning ""normal people"" will then feel at home, that's the kind of thing that happened in certain neighborhoods in Athens and led to that complete bullshit about Golden Dawn helping against the immigrants. That was then even broadcasted worldwide by opportunist journalists trying to sell a story.
