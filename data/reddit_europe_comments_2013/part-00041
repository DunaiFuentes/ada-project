Well, Germany (the other German speaking countries are excluded, obviously) has 1 big dialect groups. Low German and High German. Low and High are related to the hight of the land so Low Germany is in the north since there are no mountains and high Germany is in the south / middle.

High German can be split into Middle German and Upper German. Upper Germany is the south of Germany.

Low German and High German are officially considered different languages. Politically, they both are German but they are so different that it's not possible to understand proper spoken dialect if you don't live in the region.

Low German is very close to Dutch. If you only take Low German, you could say that Low German and Dutch are only different dialects of some other language who then evolved into different ways. I live in a region which still has some traces of Low German in it's dialect even though it's mostly a Rhinisch dialect so I hear a few words in Dutch that I know from my Grandparents who speak the local dialect. They also speak some Frisian in the north right next to the Dutch border.

Middle German and Upper German are basically what the Standard High German evolved out of because the Luther Bible was written in a very early version of modern High German. It's 500 years old and I can read it almost fluently. It's more Middle German than Upper German, though.

Well, you might think now that only 3 dialects isn't much but those are not dialects. Those are dialect groups who could be considered different languages (I don't have any papers to link now but the general rule is that if you can understand people after a few days, it's a dialect. You can't do that with Low German). 

Each group at least has 10 ""Mundarten"" which could be translated to ""way to speak"". With Austria, Switzerland and (because of the close connection to Low German) the Netherlands, German has 53 of those Mundarten. Probably 35 or 40 only in Germany but that's not easy to say.

It's not easy to say because in the south, Mundarten overlap between the countries. Upper German is a lot closer to Austrian German or Swiss German (there are clear differences between Bavarian and Baden-Würtemberger dialects). 

But Mundart also doesn't mean dialect. Each damn town has it's own dialect. I live in Düsseldorf and every year when it's time for Karneval again, you've got comedy stuff in the local dialect of Düsseldorf or Cologne on the TV. The Düsseldorfer dialect is easy to understand for me. I can't understand a damn word in the dialect from Cologne. You drive 20 minutes with a train and the dialect changes in a way that you don't understand anything. It's still a dialect, though, since you can get into it if you'd make the afford. 

There was a film that played in times where dialect was a lot more common. It played in Cologne and one line in the film was a small girl that says ""Oppa, lure!"" which means ""Grandpa, look!"". Everybody who watched the first version of that film thought the girls said ""Opa Lorenz"" (that's a name) so they changed it to something more common because everybody outside of the region around Cologne wouldn't understand the film. 

I'd love to just give you a number but I really can't. Depending on population density, there can be an unimaginable number of dialects in one Mundart. 

The diversity of today's German territory caused a lot of diversity in the language as well. It's impossible to make a clear statement about your question.

Austria and Switzerland is the same thing, I'd imagine. I can't understand a damn thing of Swiss German. It just doesn't make sense. It's white noise in my ears. Same with Austrian dialects.

Much of the animosity to Roma, Gypsies and Travelers is cultural, not racial.  And there are lots of different cultures already, all working together interdependently, so it's not that it's a problem with there being a different culture, but people have a problem with this *particular* culture for some reason.  

It's easy to call it simple bigotry.  For some people it might even be that.     
It takes a rational, solemn discussion to ask 'but why is this culture being picked out?'



That's not to say they don't experience bigotry, but it is to suggest that much of the expressed problems aren't coming from bigotry.

You can tell something is about race when they do exactly the same things as everyone else but are still able to be singled out.  A racist might have a problem with a black man no matter how similar he is in all other regards except colour.  It's difficult to say that with Romany because put a Romany in a suit, paying for a mortgage with a regular job and a regular family living next door and you simply don't know he's Romany/Gypsy.

Romany etc. only identify themselves from the crowd through actions; not race or ethnicity.

People aren't being honest if when discussing the tensions that exist if they try to shoehorn this particular public issue as being the same as racism that has gone before it.  I'm not saying it is right, but I am saying it is different.  Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Christianity, Atheism all lend themselves, in the main, to integrate into society with only a few exceptions.  

The things that are different, what temple they attend or what food they eat or what holidays the celebrate, are all insignificant in integrating.  What makes the Romany culture different are also what prevents them from integrating, putting down roots and contributing locally, paying taxes, holding down regular work.",1,1362236810,null,0,false,0,c8of1sh,t3_19ictc,t1_c8of1sh,t1_c8oe7z0,null,1431459405,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

The productivity of the Eastern European countries is increasing steadily, while in Western Europe and the US it's more or less stable. Overall this means the productivity in the EU is increasing.

&gt; He said his bosses had blacklisted him several weeks earlier after he left the steering compartment of a crane when the heater broke one snowy morning, leaving his hands too cold and stiff to control the giant machine from his post 49 feet above ground.

&gt; “I was jeopardizing my life and my colleagues’ lives,” Mr. Batsoulis said. When he climbed down to warm himself, he said his manager and a Cosco executive chastised him for slowing operations. He said he was not called back to work for another week.

&gt; “If you are a worker for Cosco, then you know suddenly how it is to work in the Chinese Republic,” said Mr. Batsoulis, who is now suing the company for unlawful dismissal and unpaid overtime.

So this is all about money not culture or diversity.

&gt;""For a long time, Catalonia has been generating a lot of resources for Spain but the fiscal balance has been very unfair,"" he said

This is how Suomi/Germany/Netherlands/UK, etc, feels about PIIGGS, including you. I want all the money you have stolen back to finland, then you can do whatever you want.

&gt;Laura Nuñez, a law student and also a new convert to independence,

Is this a sect?

&gt;Catalonia refused to back Madrid's bid for the 2012 Olympics.

So you first boicott your own country and now you are surprised how bad you are treated?

&gt;And not all Catalans are pro-independence. Some 40% of Catalans are Spanish immigrants

So this is not only about money but also racism.

&gt;There is considerable antipathy in Spain towards the Catalans, who are widely perceived as rich, spoilt, constantly complaining and forever playing the victim. Catalans are, understandably, hurt by this. ""The rise in the pro-independence movement is directly related to the Spanish state's inability to include Catalonia,"" said Miquel Berga, professor of English literature at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. ""It seems to me that only a profound change in constitutional arrangements can address the prevailing sense of dissatisfaction.""

I don't have such conversation levels since I was 7 years old.

&gt;Joan Fumaz, a chef, said: ""If we were independent, we wouldn't have to go on justifying ourselves. I'm Catalan. It would be nice not to have to explain that to people all the time.""

Basically, Mr. Krugman milks the myth that the success of German exports (recently cheaper thanks to lowered wages) were due to the rising wages in Spain, fueling imports from Germany. 

The problem with that: 

German exports to Eastern Europe and countries outside the Eurozone have grown at at least as much as than those to Spain (up to 4.2%, compared to Spain's 2.6%, from 1999 to 2010)  

Yet e.g. Slovenia, Slowakia, Estland, and Sweden do not suffer from unemployment on the Spanish level.

true,depth_breadth,BULG,Bulgaria,"&gt;  The US is spending more money which is why its economy is growing faster.

Growth is not necessarily a good thing. Growth is an increase in the GDP, but what is the GDP comprised of? In the case of the US growth means a larger prison industrial complex - building more prisons, and a larger military industry - as the latter two comprise an increasingly larger chunk of their economy. This is not the type of growth that I would consider good. 

For a general argument as to why the GDP is a poor measure of the success and well-being of a nation, listen to this speech by Robert Kennedy:

It's the argument krattr presented and that I'm trying to deconstruct.

&gt;My point is that there is little difference.

But there is a difference, there is a loss in employment and it targets mostly the least skilled workers, to promote a minimum wage is to say you're against the employment of these people.

&gt;You won't see a boom in employment if you abolish minimum wages.

You're right, we wouldn't, overall it would be a quite small reduction in unemployment, though it would happen and it would benefit most those who are worst off.

&gt;The costs of abolishing it are not worth the little statistical decrease they'll bring.

What do you mean with it's not worth it? What exactly will be lost?

&gt;Besides we can agree that more employment =/= better economy, or then the good ol' Soviet Union would've been a paradise.

Are you saying employment isn't necessarily good for the economy? Well, it is!

With regards to the USSR, they didn't operate under a free market system, they did have low unemployment but it wasn't necessarily a good allocation of their resources, it was centralised planning as opposed to separate individuals pursuing their own self-interests, no wonder they were so poor and still have so much to catch up to the Western economies which have been freer for longer.",0,1362245604,null,0,false,0,c8oh0x6,t3_19hdv6,t1_c8oh0x6,t1_c8of6e9,null,1431460356,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I had this immensely silly idea that it could be a good idea to use the vast territory of the oceans to build living room for the rising population of earth. I read somewhere that someone was designing sort of ""ocean pyramids"" that would be built similar to oil rigs, and could house somewhere to 500,000 people. And considering that living room is getting harder to get by with each passing year, it would seem sensible to tackle that problem first... it would also create a sheer neverending list of jobs.

The other problem I see is, that as of now, terraforming is pretty much a nonexistant theory *at best*. Nobody really knows if it's possible to terraform Mars, and if its possible, how long it would take to create the first settlements.

We're in a liquidity trap? Are our interest rates too low? No. Would an increase in the minimum wage help if we were? It also would not.

Yes, yes I am, at least at the wage bracket we're talking about.

Debt is still debt, and it’s still an incredibly high debt. A debt that surpasses even pre-crises GDP’s.
Extreme social change? Are you a communist or a fascist? Considering Portugal is a democracy if you are advocating a extreme social change I’d prefer to know what kind. 
Leaving the Euro would be very good in the short-term, Portugal could just print money and use that to pay its internal debts. The people would love that until they tried to buy imports and notice how worthless their money is outside Portugal. Jury is out in the long-term? Wrong that is only valid if you consider the Euro going under. Given that the road to the Euro is littered with all the doomsayers I’ll rather believe the Euro will keep going.
Wow why didn’t we do that already? So simple. Oh, wait. It’s not like that at all. 
We can’t restructure our debt, our creditors can do that not us. Or do you mean “NOT PAY”, that is one way to force a restructuring of the debt. Or do you mean you want to pay higher interest rates for a longer time period. Interest rates Portugal can’t sustain, and will leave it again in this situation a few years down the line (it’s what Portugal has been doing since the 1970’s).
Greece did it? Why yes Greece got it’s debt restructured, the difference is Greece showed it was willing to do what it needed to reform and pay it’s later debts. Portugal on the other hand still thinks it can keep on living above its means and get it’s debt forgiven since Greece got it too. Sorry, Portugal may get it’s debt forgiven if it dig’s itself a bigger hole  and then shows willingness to work.
Remember Greece’s main parties imploded and Portugal’s parties are still going strong.
So Portugal needs reforms, but only reforms in crises when it’s forced to do so. Your solution is to leave the Euro and then in calm times Portugal will reform by itself (disregarding logic and past evidence).
Portugal has a long history of only changing and reforming when it’s back is against the wall, this is not the 1st time the IMF has pulled the bacon out of the fire.
So the solution to reduce government debt is to create more government? Just why does a small country that you can cross in a car in 7 hours need regional government for? More fat and job’s for the boy’s? I really don’t understand this obsession with regional government in Portugal.
It’s your job to point out alternatives to austerity. You are the one whining about it.
Austerity sucks, unfortunately it is the only way Portugal gets off it’s fat ass and starts working. The proof is in the pudding or so the saying goes,  just look at the reforms started. Also if anyone thinks PS will change a thing I suggest you not hold your breath.

I've seen the plans and I'm not at all convinced by the geometry of it all nor capacity. The same goes for a scattering of jewish security guards that were supposed to marshall thousands of bodies, and the witness testimony—there are many details that conflict. I've also seen the propaganda movie that saw allied forces frogmarch a town to a near by camp to view all manner of absurd items: human soap, skin lampshades, pelvic bone ashtrays (still pristine white) and shrunken heads. In all I cannot trust any evidence that came out of the military which is a construct specifically designed to kill, demean the enemy and cover up home evils. Depending on where I live I may not even be allowed to pursue certain lines of inquiry because for some bizarre reason ""The Holocaust"" and it's truthiness is the only event that has a ""right to exist and not be challenged"" enforced by law.

Ultimately I can never know, because I wasn't there. All I can do really, like Finkelstein, is look at the current narrative and how an atrocity was and is being used to further various economic and political ideologies. No honest person can say they care about it whilst turning a blind eye to Allied atrocities and the some 800k people that were forcibly removed from Palestine. Let's also not forget it was IBM that was providing the means of ""accounting"" amongst other technologies, so whilst we project all the ills of that period onto the loser we miss a great deal of context. Eugenics was an American invention, they dropped the nukes, yet it is they who went on to be the noble victorious humanitarians whilst having a death toll that rivals Nazi Germany.

Personally, I believe the norm was work camps and concentration camps, similar in design used by the British in the Boer war some years earlier to contain dissenting occupied peoples. It was then the dissenters that were killed on mass. There would have been many other deaths but I put that down to starvation, over work and unchecked disease, and in a way some blame can be thrown in the other direction. The Allied forces could treat typhoid, the Germans could not, and it was them that had Europe sieged and starving. That also explains much of the infrastructure: delousing. Why should someone going to the incinerator have their heads shaven?

I very much agree. I'm not quite sure why you are making it. Where did these quotas come from?

All I'm saying is that the EU allows regions to enjoy the benefit of being a small country along with benefits that were previously solely associated to being a big country. I can go work in France or Spain. I can sell products to Poland and Portugal. I can cross borders without having to fill out paperwork (except  the UK of course...). And I can do with without having to vote for a Scottish MP to vote on matters that do not affect me to indirectly set the yearly budget that the Government that does represent me, a needlessly complicated way to do things and the result of stupid tradition. Government no longer needs to tie in to who won what war 300 years ago and what heir to the throne happened to marry what noble. If that is the argument for why the big, bloated countries should remain in their current form I refer you back to my earlier point. Ahh... nationalism.

true,tugasnake,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;Exactly.

It's not a crime to work for a low wage, you hurt no one.

&gt;No, but implying that laws that are broken should not exist is far more sane.

Thing is, although you could improve the minimum wage law it would still be a bad law at it's root.

&gt;So you say.

Countries with higher economical freedom do better than those which lack it.

&gt;So your solution is to that is having more people reliant on social help? It essentially is the same. You had 3 guys that paid more taxes and had less social support and one guy who was relying on the state, now you have 4 guys that pay less taxes than those 3 and rely more on the state than the other 3, all this so that the other unemployed guy could feel productive. Good job.

Lower unemployment benefits the employees. It leads to higher competition between employers for the best workers and thus drives the price of labour upwards. As it currently stands employees have it good since there's so much human capital being wasted. Under these conditions employers can get away with imposing harsher conditions on their workers. The abolition of the minimum wage would actually benefit employees since there would be less unemployed people desperate for jobs and the state would see their need to raise revenue towards social spending reduced.

&gt;The mere fact that you think what I said was condescending tells a lot about the state of our society.

Of course it's condescending you prick! You're telling someone that they can't work below minimum wage but that they are free to go ahead and spend their labour on a charity! Do you think this an option for someone who has to pay for rent, food, etc?

&gt;Like I said, he can always volunteer. No one is keeping him at home.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;To promote a minimum wage is to say that I want a reasonable amount of money paid to a low-skilled worker.

But that's not what it achieves! What it achieves is the lower-skilled workers to be laid off and replaced by more qualified people, sure, people whose wages are worth 600€/month might not be too bothered with it but if someone's labour is only worth 400€/month, that person will find it almost impossible to justify his wage and will most definitely end up without any kind of job!

&gt;Just because someone is willing to slave themselves off (:toot: HYPERBOLE :toot:), doesn't mean they should.

The whole association with slavery is absolutely ridiculous, we're talking about bilateral contracts, nobody is ever forced to accept any employment, in fact, between letting each individual separately reach an agreement or enforcing laws determining which wages are and are not allowed, it's the second situation which requires coercion.

Besides, who are you to say ""600€/month is fine but 400€/month is unlawful"" and enforcing a law that will discriminate against the least qualified people?

Imagine that for whatever reason you had a lousy education and therefore had very low skills, and that for that reason, you could only find employment at best for 580€/month, what would happen to you if the government raised the minimum wage to 620€/month because, in their view, it would improve your living standard and pull you off ""slavery""-like conditions? Would you still support the minimum wage in that situation? Because, as it stands, you do support this awful system whose objectives are noble but whose results are wholly negative!

&gt;Lower average wages, lower wages per worker

Sure, but only because more people with low skills would be employed. The average income would rise, however, because you'd go from a situation where it's ""unemployed / 580€ / 700€ / 1200€"" to a situation of ""420€ / 580€ / 700€ / 1200€"" (this in the short term, in the long term, all wages would increase because the lower the unemployment rate, the higher bargaining power the workers have and the higher wages they can justify).

&gt;social unrest

How so? People pursuing their self-separate interests doesn't create social unrest, what creates it is when the government tries to live their lives for them and dictate, in this case, what wages they're allowed to receive or not.

On the long term, you'd have lower unemployment (specially among the people worse off), higher productivity and less need for government spending - and that would help in reducing social unrest.

&gt;these are not even the full package you'll get.

I'm sorry, you're predicting the apocalypse but countries such as Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland where there's no government-mandated minimum wage are proof of the contrary. Sure, they have a lot of other things going for them but you can't dismiss the impact that less governmental intervention (in this case, in the labour market) has in their economy.

&gt;What is the difference between 3 guys getting 400€ with moderate social support and 1 unemployed guy getting full social support to 4 guys getting 300€ and high social support?

You're making the false assumption that the average income would go down without the minimum wage when it's the opposite, the lower the unemployment rate, the higher wages go.

What you want to do is increase the worker's bargaining power, when the unemployment rate is high, finding good replacement workers is easier for firms, while finding another job is harder for workers. Being in a weak bargaining position, workers may have no choice but to accept lower wages. That's why even in that case, it would be best to have everyone employed. Not to mention that someone, even while getting a relatively low paid job, is improving their skills, whereas if they were to be unemployed, they'd be in a much worse situation.

&gt;Well, better stats. That's it. State pays the same, employer pays the same, no more money gets into the economy.

What about the results of their labour? Imagine that, in your example, the minimum wage was of 400€, between the first three people all creating 420€ each worth of goods or services into the economy or this plus the fourth guy also contributing with 380€ worth of goods and services - we go from a situation where lowering or abolishing the minimum wage and allowed the fourth worker to be employed increase the overall output from 1260€ to 1640€, that's more goods and services being produced, more money for the employers to higher more people and pay higher wages and also lower unemployment reducing government expenses and increasing the living standards of everybody in the economy.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"You're very right that the elite are responsible for more tax evasion than others. In that respect I agree that more needs to be done, whatever that maybe.

&gt;According to a remarkable presentation that a member of Greece’s central bank gave last fall, the gap between what Greek taxpayers owed last year and what they paid was about a third of total tax revenue, roughly the size of the country’s budget deficit. The “shadow economy”—business that’s legal but off the books—is larger in Greece than in almost any other European country, accounting for an estimated 27.5 per cent of its G.D.P. (In the United States, by contrast, that number is closer to nine per cent.) [Source.] (http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/07/11/110711ta_talk_surowiecki#ixzz2MQ0p2Z8W)

Until proven otherwise I can only go from this evidence, but I doubt that the tax revenues unpaid by the ultra-wealthy account for 27.5% GDP.

&gt; They found that €28bn (£22.4bn) of tax was evaded in 2009 by self-employed people alone.

&gt;As GDP that year was €235bn and the total tax base was just €98bn, it is clear that this was a significant sum. At a tax rate of 40%, it amounted to almost half the country's budget deficit in 2008, and 31% in 2009.

&gt;The chief offenders are professionals in medicine, engineering, education, accounting, financial services and law. Among the self-employed documented in the report are accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers.

&gt;The film depicts approximately 19 consecutive hours in the lives of three friends in their early twenties from immigrant families living in an impoverished multi-ethnic French housing project (a ZUP - zone d'urbanisation prioritaire) in the suburbs of Paris, in the aftermath of a riot. Vinz (Vincent Cassel), who is Jewish, is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win respect by killing a cop, manically practising the role of Travis Bickle from the film Taxi Driver in the mirror secretly. His attitude towards police, for instance, is a simplified, stylized blanket condemnation, even to individual policemen who make an effort to steer the trio clear of troublesome situations. Hubert (Hubert Koundé) is an Afro-French boxer and small time drug dealer, the most mature of the three, whose gymnasium was burned in the riots. The quietest, most thoughtful and wisest of the three, he sadly contemplates the ghetto and the hate around him. He expresses the wish to simply leave this decadent world of violence and hate behind him, but does not know how since he lacks the means to do so. Saïd - Sayid in some English subtitles - (Saïd Taghmaoui) is a Maghrebin who inhabits the middle ground between his two friends' responses to their place in life.


At the time where debates are multiplying on national identity and immigration in France, this film has never been so true. It is a very powerful piece of art, with a great director and actors. There is totally material for an essay since there is a LOT of interpretations possible (open ending) in the plot and in the values it carries. The soundtrack is great, and the movie itself made a lot of noise at the time of its release, wich give you even more material to talk about.

Of course they have to advertise themselves so more people would vote for them (especially because of the communist terror), this is what all communist parties in Europe have done.

I know that a lot of rich people already can get away from the justice system, but I personally prefer the current system where there's inefficiency and waste to a system but once in a while there's indeed some justice than a system where you had to reach a market agreement about who should be arrested, who should go to jail and who should be protected by the military - that's just nonsense.

&gt;I don't get what liking everyone else has to do with anarco-capitalism, if anything in anarco-capitalism the driver would be profit and greed, not love for the greater good.

Hey, I like the greater good :\

Profit and greed are good when it's in the marketplace, not when it's in the justice system. Under that system, you'd be dead in a day, I'm sure all the people you've pissed off would come together and pay some court to sentence you to death because lol they paid for it. That or they'd kill you themselves and pay the court to decide they were innocent, I dunno lol.

So is Reddit.  

So is every internet service provider involved in transferring the data between you and the rest of us.

Every year, you will find the performance of all these capitalists' services a little bit better than the year before.  Back in the 80s cellphones were the size and weight of a brick, and cost a fortune to run.  Today you have kids in Africa using cellphones to access the entire aggregate of human knowledge (Google, Wikipedia, etc.) at a tiny fraction of the cost.

In contrast, the services supplied by governments around the world are slow, bureaucratic, sclerotic in most cases, corrupt in many, and they have failed to evolve the tiniest bit since the first nation states' declared their constitutions over two centuries ago.  The more governments see themselves as the sole supplier of these services, the poorer people are.  A simple comparison between North Korea and South Korea, or between East and West Germany (if you're old enough to remember) should suffice to make my point.

You may think of services typically supplied by governments, such as education or healthcare, and be happy to pay your taxes.  Well, look at the results achieved in those fields by private companies like Coursera.com or Wikipedia or Google (education is, after all, knowledge organisation), or all the massively evolving technologies in healthcare (the Human Genome Project being just the tip of the iceberg) and you'll realise that a coercive regional monopoly taking over a particular sector, any sector, is going to lead to inefficient supply of goods and services after just a short while.  In contrast, a free market in those same services leads to massively improved standards of service within just a few years.

I doubt a Reddit post will suffice to change your mind.  I know I was once a socialist (it comes with growing up in an academic family in the 70s) and no amount of common sense would have led me to change my mind.  But I'll leave the discussion with this: you will not fill your cup with new knowledge without emptying it first.

Yes, because right now Greece and Spain aren't bordering on civil war. This is the first generation that has become more impoverished that the one before. There is a social debt that capitalists have externalised and are trying to magic away, or pretend it doesn't exist.

Io, però, per qualche insolito motivo non disprezzo i mezzi pubblici (E devo prendere ogni mattina la CIRCUMVESUVIANA, una metro e un autobus, di norma tutti stracolmi) anzi, mi piace assai viaggiare con molte altre persone. È che sento come una sorta di empatia: tutti accomunati dalla stessa sfortuna, condividiamo quella che è la tragedia del trasporto pubblico.

Ma esiste una sottocategoria del tizio che si lamenta che forse tu non conosci: la Signora Che Urla.

Ogni volta che un mezzo è affollato la SCU è presente, ma è capace di centuplicare il potere di rompicoglioni del tizio che si lamenta. Come? Semplice, la SCU non ce l'ha con il macchinista, con l'azienda, la provincia, la regione o chicchessia: la SCU ce l'ha con te.

Tu che osi avere abbastanza ossigeno da assumere un colorito ancora sul viola; tu che per qualche assurdo motivo non ti sei gettato su quell'uomo che tanto è il sudore che lo impregna che ha palesemente partecipato a una qualche maratona di cui ignoravi l'esistenza prima di incontrarlo; tu che ti sarai sicuramente fermato al secondo livello di Tetris da non riuscire a vedere l'ovvia posizione che dovresti assumere perché la Signora Che Urla prenda questo treno e non il prossimo che sta tra cinque minuti (perché la Signora Che Urla questo treno non può assolutamente perderlo: c'è il rischio che per qualche motivo che noi sfigati non riusciremo mai a comprendere la fermata successiva si dissolva). Ma non temere, per tua fortuna la SCU è capace di indirizzarti sulla retta via. Lei sa qual è la panacea per questo male e con estrema pacatezza griderà nel tuo orecchio quelle tre bellissime parole: ""Andate nei corridoi!""

Tu ti volti e scopri che effettivamente esistevano dei corridoi, erano sempre stati lì, ma ora li intravedi tra il ginocchio di una vecchietta caduta a terra e la faccia di un bambino (che probabilmente doveva scendere due fermate fa) messo lì perché non rubasse l'aria a quelli di sopra. 
Dopo una serie di scambi di battute tra il passeggero comune vicino alla porta e la Signora Che Urla sulle varianti del ""signora, non c'è spazio"" e ""non mi importa, io devo salire"" un uomo sulla quarantina in fondo al treno riesce ad assimilare l'organismo più debole a lui vicino creando finalmente lo spazio che permette alla SCU di avere il posto che merita.

Simpatico è anche il modo che la SCU ha di scendere dal treno: una volta fermo alla STAZIONE SUCCESSIVA (farsela a piedi sarebbe stato davvero TROPPO) le porte si aprono mostrando una folla pronta a sostituire quelli che sarebbero dovuti scendere (che si fa anche da parte all'apertura delle porte). Però no, troppo facile così, queste persone non hanno ancora identificato la Signora Che Urla ed è necessario mettere le cose in chiaro. 

Ed è il momento più lieto della giornata quando senti la SCU allontanarsi a suon di ""Fate prima scendereeeeeee"".

Let me explain. There were talks in Romania that they will raise the minimum wage and every uneducated person was like ""fuck yeah more money"", but you have to realise that when minimum wages are increased so does the amount you have to pay in taxes back to the state and other institutions. So while yes, you get more, you won't be getting a LOT more. The biggest winner here isn't the worker, it's the state. Then the worker and the loser is the employer because he gets to pay more for both the state and the employees. While this might not affect big businesses that much, it could still be a considerable blow to small family businesses while at the same changing almost nothing for the employees in terms of improving their life.

With that said, I don't have a problem with minimum wage and I actually support it.

There are water companies in (almost) all the countries of the world. In majority of them, however, water is not drinkable without boiling. In some, not even with boiling. 

EDIT: And we are directly paying circa 2 000 million euros for road and railway infrastructure maintenance per year, out of state budget of 55 0000 million euros, circa 4%. This is not enough to upkeep the infrastructure, that has been slowly deteriorating since the depression of early 90s. For example, we don't have money to build the new rail up to Oulu, which is very important -- even essential -- for trade with Swedish and Finnish Lapland, particularly after we started mining there. Not to mention stuff like the traffic control system at Helsinki Railway Station (most of the VR-jokes are largely about our current system, best descriptive with the word ""historical"") or the maintenance of the motorways, which are also getting worse by the year, etc. 

Football fields and regional roads are maintained from the county budget. They don't cost much, but then, the counties are even cutting on libraries, schools and basic medical services, so paying for County Maintenance [kaupunkitekniikka] to cut the grass, repavement and other upkeep will surely not be left untouched.

Wait. You literally don't understand how public companies work?

Ok, let me run through it for you: A shareholder is an investor in a company. They buy and sell shares, and the more *profit* the company makes, the richer the shareholder gets. At the same time, the shareholders own the company, so obviously all companies are run in a way that optimises for *shareholder profit*. This isn't news or any big secret, it's just how our version of capitalism works. And it sucks, because it means that for services that were going to be bought *anyway*, prices are higher because the shareholders need to turn a profit, whereas the government doesn't.

The Russia Today report makes no sense watsoever. The protesters against the defence ministry **were not Albanians, they were Macedonians sports hooligans**.

However, the pictures shown are from a protest the next day. This protest happened in response to the beating of several children by Macedian hooligans on the streets of Skopja after the appointment of an ex KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) member as Minister of Devence.

This is one of many incedents whereas macedinian hooligans roam the streets of Skopje beating up Albanian children, not a single time did the predominantly Macedonian police intervene. Videos of police standing by watching have been shown on TV.

The protests were initially organized for the international media to see what is happening in Macedonia but of course someone had to post a friggin Russia Today article instead of a reputable news source. The police intervened immediately in the case of the Albanian protests, eve though they were peaceful.

With such bias and now EU politician understanding shit about the situation on the ground, Macedonia is a timebomb.

. Also, you will have to  study and kinda a lot of class. The best way to find a job for you will probably be to work with the local ""Junior Entreprise"". it is a society of student that connects firms with students: firms offer missions a student can realize and pay them. You can see some pieces of information here: http://www.hec-junior-conseil.fr/en/ I strongly advice to try to do that, it will be far better on a resume and probably more worthy in income.

For the loans, I can not say anything about special ones but this: very prestigious schools in France have tights links with many big companies and banks (HEC included). Entering HEC, you join an ""elite club"" and that's good for you because French banks are already on the campus and offers many services (in my school, a Vietnamese friend of mine got advantageous loans). Big companies might offer scholarships too.  

HEC has a reputation for its special atmosphere ""they are an elite and proud of it"". That you appreciate that kind of feelings or not, you will meet lot of interesting people. Enjoy your stay. I don't know in which years will you arrive, HEC is a 3 years curses (after 2 year of intensive preparation in other institutions). 

Grandes Ecoles in France have a very very strong student society way of life (not as much as Japan though). HEC is especially famous for his jumping (horse competition) but also do cruses in Caraibes ski weeks etc.

The problem is easily demonstrated by comparing the EU to the USA in this aspect: its easier for a Texan to move to Massachusetts than it is for a Portuguese to move to Germany. Why? Cultural and linguistic differences mostly. Its also not that easy when viewed from the other perspective. A load of foreign migrants often leads to problems in the host country. The UK is currently having these issues regarding Romania, and has/had it with Poles (i.e. some people don't want them).

&gt; Are you completely oblivious to the hundreds of billions that have been given to the banks to bail them out? That money was given to banks to keep them afloat after their entire system collapsed because it was unsustainable. Money people pay through taxes bailed them out even though they were irresponsible.

See, this just shows how utterly ignorant you are about the whole situation. You do realize a bailout is a short-term loan with a typical interest rate of somewhere between 10% to 30%?

It took them too many years to completely break from Moscow. All these parties just rebrand themselves to get with the times. ""The Left"" is also an even less stigmatized name for a party. Our current (ex)communist party in Sweden was known as ""Vänsterpartiet: Kommunisterna"" (The Left Party: The Communists in English) until the collapse of the USSR when they dropped communist from their name but it is no secret that their current and former leader were communists and if they say anything else it is a lie. Since Bersani is now the leader of a social democratic party right now he is forced to have more moderate views if he wants power but I seriously don't doubt that he is still secretly part-communist because that's what his roots are and that he was a member of these types of parties for a very long time.

This was the original title so you know: ""Just ONE cannabis joint 'can bring on schizophrenia' as well as damaging memory."" Its only a subtle change, but it makes a big difference.

&gt;The scientists studied rats who had been given the active ingredient of cannabis - in a similar dose to a person smoking a joint.

Humans are not rats. That's an initial problem, but we continue. The study itself actually states the following:

&gt;…rats that were given a drug that mimics the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana…

So, not the ""active ingredients of marijuana"" as the Mail reports. The drug mimics it, but its still incorrect reporting. This chemical is called CP55940, its not naturally occurring, and its 45x stronger than THC. That already causes a big difference. Moving on:

The upper level dose in the study was 0.30 mg/kg. A dude weighing 10 stones/63 kg  would get 18.9 mgs of CP55940. Given the compound is 45x stronger than THC, this equates to 850mg of THC, or 85 joints at once (at 10mg per joint). So the Mail reports that one joint causes the same effects as simultaneously smoking 85.

The previous winner had 16 faults, the DM took this one with 23. 23 misrepresentations in one article. And its an article based on a fucking study.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"Here is my understanding of the situation:

Some areas of the world have a better production base than others. They produce services or products very efficiently. This can be attributed to a headstart in technology or industrial know-how or, as some people claim, culture. 

No matter, the most efficient producers want to export what they make and earn in return something of equal market value. However, since the other areas are not nearly as good at producing stuff, they cannot really afford it, so they buy these products and services on credit. The efficient producers accept this arrangement because what's the alternative? Lowering their production?

Buying something on credit represents a promise of better future production. In reality it is more likely than not that even in the future the areas that start with the most powerful production base will still be better producers than the rest. 

This leads to the awkward situation we find ourselves today. The most efficient producers want to keep producing more value than others can afford but at the same time they want to be fully compensated in equal market value. 

Historically there are many solutions to this conundrum. 

1. The creditor areas go to their debtors and try to collect as much as they can (neocolonialism). This results in the debtor areas being even less able to produce stuff in competition to their creditors. The creditor areas also go into recession eventually because fewer people will buy their products.

2. The debtor areas try to become more competitive by living more thriftily. Of course, that forces the more efficient producers to lower their production so leading them to a recession.

3. The debtor areas start paying in something of diminishing value (different currencies). This can lead to all sort of complications for economic cooperation, even a currency war. 

4. A system is built so that some debt is automatically forgiven all the time (fiscal transfers). This is difficult to accept for the creditor areas because they feel cheated out of their labour. 

In conclusion, the accounting system we rely on is built upon the false premise that not paying debts is taboo but this is impossible to achieve due to the differences in productivity from area to area.

true,krattr,null,null,"&gt; You're really dancing around the issue.

On the contrary, I'm asking for the full argument before replying.

You're worried about taxation (""VAT is the precondition in question here""), worker compensation, and rights.

1) Taxation

The whole VAT issue might not be what you think it is. Businesses are not paying the state and wave their money goodbye. It does not work like that. It's not a case of paying VAT on top of your coffee bill.

What is the function of a commercial hub? To bring clients. When is this possible? If it offers a competitive advantage. Are the clients able to use other ports? Yes. Will a state benefit if there are no clients? No.

KPMG is a large multinational company, headquartered in the Netherlands. You might be familiar with them. They published [a brochure explaining Netherlands' business advantages](http://www.kpmg.com/nl/en/issues-and-insights/articlespublications/pages/the-netherlands-your-business-hub-for-european-success.aspx), titled ""The Netherlands: Your Business Hub for European Success"".

Taken from the infobox listing the process of importing into and exporting from the Netherlands:

&gt; The main tax and customs opportunities

&gt; * Customs duty deferral by using economic customs regimes such as bonded warehousing, inward processing relief, temporary importation or processing under customs control

&gt; * No customs duty in case of re-export outside the EU

&gt; * VAT deferral upon import into NL (with fiscal representative, no cash out)

&gt; * VAT shifted to NL customer

&gt; * 0% VAT in case of re-export to EU or US

&gt; * Easy and quick VAT refund procedure upon import

[Belgium also moves towards that direction](http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxnewsflash/pages/belgium-vat-import-deposit-system-repeal-vat-exemption-non-profits.aspx):


&gt; When goods are imported in Belgium, the amount of import VAT is immediately due to the Belgian customs authorities—at the moment of the physical import. This amount of import VAT can then be recovered through the Belgian VAT return system.

&gt; However, several months may pass before the import VAT can be recovered—effectively resulting in a “pre-financing” of import VAT. 

&gt; [...]

&gt; The Belgian government proposes to repeal this VAT deposit system in order to address the competitive disadvantage that the system creates for Belgian ports. For example, in the Netherlands, no similar deposit is required to obtain an import license (thus, a VAT advantage for the Dutch ports).

You wrote:

&gt; You argue about competing with other countries in Europe, but I somehow doubt that they don't take any VAT or something equally submissive in return to being a transit hub for European imports.

Clearly, these doubts have no basis in reality.

2) Worker compensation

It is a free market. Employees may choose their job and companies may choose their employees. In this specific case (Piraeus), employees are getting paid at least 2-3 times the minimum wage.

3) Rights

A state does not preemptively deny business licenses because someone, somewhere, sometime might violate workers' rights. There are competent authorities to examine allegations of mistreatment. I understand that Batsoulis and Markakis, 2 out of 350 workers (less than 1% of the workforce), had some complaints. They claim they were fired because they complained. Newspapers wrote that the court would hear their case in late January. There is no decision yet.

Apollo was a great achievement but as a program it was risky, expensive and unsustainable - a by-product of geopolitics of the time. If you want an actual working long term human space program first step is not to do Apollo however golden it may seem in memories. Just look at how many times US has gone to the Moon since. 

The Space Race effectively ended in 1967 with the [Outer Space Treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty). As the treaty limited the military use of space, Moon, and other bodies it diminished their perceived strategic value and the political incentive for funding such programs, and eventually led to first cutting and then ending of Apollo-progam. After that the remaining space race was all LEO and it's strategic possibilities with space planes, spy satellites, killer satellites and stuff.

Flying humans to orbit is expensive. I know there are people and companies who claim to do it dirt cheap - but haven't actually delivered. As it is, it's still expensive, and Russian tech is still the cheapest and most reliable way to do it.

Having humans in space is even more expensive. And I know there are people and companies who claim to do it dirt cheap - but haven't actually delivered. As it is, it's still very expensive.

Flying beoynd LEO is even more expensive. Building in space is even more expensive. Living in space is even more expensive. Learning to use the resources in space to live there is even more expensive. etc...

&gt; Lots of different countries and companies working on the quest of space exploration in all of their different ways and all racing each other. It's gonna be an excellent race.

You want a sustainable long term human space flight program? A race is not much of help there. Because: 

1. When the race ends then that's it. Achievement unlocked. No need to do it again (see Apollo).

2. It costs a lot. Makes much more sense to pool the scarce resources in co-operation. For example China is projected to be the biggest economy on Earth by 2030. Makes much more sense to co-operate than exclude.

Aside from hospital service, the only way to benefit from German services  is registering yourself in a city/town. In order to register yourself you need a house contract. Then you have every right like a German, including voting in local elections. Even if you dont work, you are actively paying for the house you are living in and constantly consuming in Germany, this means that there is a constant influx of money from, in my case, Finland to Germany which is objectively positive for Germany. I am also pretty sure that most of rights that Germany gives to finnish is because germans would be treated the same in Finland.

So yes, German services are easy to reach but the system for foreigners, which I am pretty sure most of germans are actually not familiar with, makes you pay one way or the other.

Nonetheless, the ratios are striking.

No, I don't realise that. It's a systemic crisis of capitalism unable to produce new profits that's been going going since the 70's. Banks played a major role in this in the last 5 years,  if not the most important.  The vast majority of GDP spending has been on bank bailouts.  Bank recapitalisation alone amounted to 30B this quarter for Greece, almost 150Billion since the crisis begun if I am not mistaken. That's half the Greek GDP.

To make matters even worse, the financial meltdown will never allow for any of this debt to repayed, but it will destroy the social life of Europe. 

To push even further, UK has a debt of 180% when they build NHS, at the end of WWII. Germany' debt was forgiven in the 50's.  Such things are unthinkable right now.

They wanted to use space for a military advantage. If the goal was some thing different and some thing less about damage and more about progress then I doubt the space program would have (in the long term) failed so badly. If there were long term goals like (long term) financial gain or the collection of rare minerals then the race would (and could) turn out differently. I believe that is what is happening with all the private companies at the moment. They're all trying to get up to space and make a profit in a long term fashion. So that they can continually see financial returns for the foreseeable future. That's one reason why I think this will work better than it did previously.

I also disagree with you on the notions of cost. The reason it costs so much now is because of our extremely primitive launcher technologies. ie strapping a load of *expensive* fuel and *expensive* rockets to a small pod and lighting it. National space agencies are working on cheaper alternatives and so are private companies. The Skylon project is my favourite example with its single stage to launch mechanism which will make space flight (above LEO) over ten times cheaper once the technology has been safety tested. It's already been proven to work in theory.

Resources aren't a problem in the long term. The problem is our current methods which are obviously primitive and ineffective. Space travel will not always be expensive and that's where the real frontier is. Making space flight cheaper. We're fast on our way to doing that. What I do agree with pooling is certain aspects of our technologies as those are more scarce, but only certain aspects.

Additionally, the reason we're going into space this time is not for nationalistic *""We can do it, so we must!""* typed reasons. This time we're going to with a much heavier focus on benefitting humanity. We're not just going to go to Mars and see, well we've done that let's call it quits. This time it'll be followed through with more profitable ventures for the companies and governments involved like that space mining company founded, among others, by Larry Page the founder of Google. A lot of these companies gains are already visible in the satellite industry.

... nope. There is a lot to criticize in Hungary, but the democratic institutions are still there. Come next May, Fidesz will be possible to defeat - though I must admit I don't see any reasonably competent, non-corrupt and non-batshit-crazy alternatives. However that is the opposition's fault which is refusing to rid itself of the corrupt, the demagogue and the post-communist people.

I guess I will vote for [Schiffer's party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_Can_Be_Different). What's left of it after Karácsony tried to gut him for Bajnai anyways.

He is the only politician who I can trust, even though his stances and mines are not in any great overlap (liberal - me too, green - not really, anti-capitalist - nope). This is how far Hungarian politics have fallen. But he is the only reasonable choice left. And it's not like LMP is going to be a major party of a coalition.

OTOH this mega-amendment is really bad news. Fidesz wants to set the dialogue of the country for the next 20 years and they will be able to because of their damned 2/3 majority.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Capitalism entered the sector. 

Competition is a good thing, generally. For a lot of things, though, true competition cannot exist. I'm glad you bring on telephone companies, because in Denmark we had particularly bad experiences with privatizing this sector — namely, the infrastructure (copper wires) was maintained by a single company, it was completely infeasible (and grossly inefficient) for a second company to try to establish a similar infrastructure, so the eventually privatized company had a monopoly, and prices were artificially high as a result of it.

This is exactly the problem with telephone and cable companies in the US, by the way — parallel, sub-efficient infrastructure, and no true competition.

Cellphones changed the market immensely, because they require a lot less infrastructure (or rather, the infrastructure they require is a lot cheaper), so there is indeed something close to true competition, and prices in Europe are accordingly low. That's a good thing.

true,Nemo84,BELG,Belgium,"&gt; It's a systemic crisis of capitalism unable to produce new profits that's been going going since the 70's

Really? Because from where I'm standing, which incidentally is called reality (try it sometimes), it seems that the only countries in real problems right now are the ones who have been grossly mismanaging their finances since the '70s. Others have little problems, despite being just as capitalist (or even more) as the problem countries. Thus it seems capitalism itself can not be the problem.

&gt;  The vast majority of GDP spending has been on bank bailouts.

Source?

&gt; Bank recapitalisation alone amounted to 30B this quarter for Greece, almost 150Billion since the crisis begun if I am not mistaken. That's half the Greek GDP.

You know why Greece has to recapitalize its banks so much? Because the Greek banks got hit very hard when suddenly the Greek government could no longer pay its debts. When the EU was then forced to negotiate a huge debt restructuring for Greece, Greek banks got hit by 1/3 of the restructured losses. And thus the banks needed recapitalization. 

None of this bank recapitalization would have happened had the Greek state been able to service its debts. You are simply switching cause and effect because it better suits your simplistic ""banks == evil"" worldview.

&gt; To make matters even worse, the financial meltdown will never allow for any of this debt to repayed, but it will destroy the social life of Europe. 

Europe is doing fine. Could be better but has been worse in the past. It's merely that a few European countries have been merrily living above their means for the past few decades and now whine when they are forced to deal with the consequences of their past stupidity.

&gt; To push even further, UK has a debt of 180% when they build NHS, at the end of WWII. Germany' debt was forgiven in the 50's. Such things are unthinkable right now.

Germany's debt in the 50's was still the result of the ridiculous terms forced upon it at the end of WW1. It already caused hyperinflation once and everyone agreed that they were better of if it were forgiven. Germany was considered a productive, hardworking country that only needed a clean start to once again become a great productive nation.

Greece has already had over 100 billion euros of its debts simply erased. Not because anyone wanted to, but because we were forced to. Their well-earned reputation, unlike Germany, is of entitled slackers. Even if all of their debts were forgiven tomorrow, they would still be deficit spending without the austerity and in the same shit again in 30-40 years. They've already wasted several opportunities to turn their problems around in the past, and used those instead to gather up more debts. That is why such a thing is unthinkable for Greece.",0,1362333389,null,0,false,0,c8ozr4d,t3_19kjcz,t1_c8ozr4d,t1_c8oz3ny,null,1431469389,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Water is not a natural monopoly. In Sweden, you get most of it coming out of the sky, and spread relatively evenly accross all rooftops, in the form of rain.
The technology for purifying this water isn't a natural monopoly either.

Water companies are the DEFINITION of natural monopoly. It's the very dictionary definition. It's also mentioned in the wikipedia article near the top, I see.

&gt;It costs a lot more if you're going to be running 90% of drinking water down your toilet, in your shower, in your dishwasher and in your washing machine.

I rather wash my teeth, bathe, drink, clean my clothes and do my dishes with clean water. If you want to do that in brown goo, be my guest.

&gt;That's because it has been heavily subsidised by your taxes, ..

It isn't. Again, natural monopolies (and their infrastructure) are expensive to build and cheap to maintain.

&gt;Which is exactly what this advert is about.

The advert is about everything that taxes do. They built the waterworks and now they fund the regulators that keep the quality good. Not only for water companies, but also what you can put into lakes etc. Further, even Britain who has privatised water heavily regulates the field.

But I didn't create the advert, so this would be only my view on the subject :)

&gt;Ellinen, if you're happy to pay half your salary...

More like third, but ok.

&gt;to run drinking water down your toilet 

Well, water is one of those few resources we have plenty. That being said, the toilets do have two settings to address this problem at least partially.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; That is why the market finds a lateral way to compete.

Yeah? Well, the problem is that this doesn't actually happen for a lot of things. Cell phones did change the market, but only because it was illegal for the monopoly to bar cell phone companies access to phone line terminals.

Cell phones could have happened anyway — but they most likely wouldn't have been able to call landline phones.

The thing is, competition is good, except for companies. Companies hate competition and will do anything to prevent it. This is why we have regulation and anti-monopoly laws.

Even then, phones are not the best example of the type of areas I'm talking about. How about healthcare and health insurance? Are you going to build two hospitals next to each other and let them compete for ""customers""? How about roads? You'd build two half-empty roads with two different sets of toll booths, each trying to create a profit for shareholders, while limiting the profits of the people actually driving on the roads?

It stands to reason (which is to say ""it is pretty darn obvious"") that some things benefit from competition while others simply just don't. We know how to run a state efficiently, and there are a *ton* of services that it can do better (cheaper) than private companies, simply because private companies aren't big enough to invest in the infrastructure, and when they are, they're going to exploit citizens rather than serve them. I know this is a mind-boggling concept outside of Northern Europe, but governments can be something we call ""not corrupt"".

Quelques remarques :

- je ne suis pas convaincu que tu puisses relier ainsi les traitements stylistiques de la peinture et ceux d'un texte. Par ailleurs, je ne pense pas que la meilleure manière d'exprimer la monotonie d'un quotidien soit en répétant les adjectifs et expressions. D'une manière générale, en littérature, plus c'est concis mieux c'est.
- ça me surprend un peu que tu t'imposes un carcan de style plutôt que de te laisser prendre par l'écriture. On a du coup l'impression d'un exercice de style, ou de quelque chose qui devrait aller vers la poésie ? 
- est-il vraiment une bonne idée de montrer le tableau avant le texte ? En ce qui concerne en tout cas, mon imagination a adopté le visuel du tableau et du coup je ne suis pas sûr de pouvoir apprécier ton texte pour ce qu'il est.
- sur le fond j'ai du mal à m'attacher au personnage, finalement à par le fait qu'elle s'ennuie, je n'ai rien pour la connaître. Or il suffit de quelques touches même très légères : d'où viennent ces cigarettes, quand est-ce qu'elle a commencé à fumer, un souvenir d'enfance, un prénom, un homme évoqué, son état d'esprit, sa fatigue...

true,[deleted],null,null,"Short answer: Local elections on 24 March, so the people and parties are consolidating. 

Long answer: Albanians are almost 1/4 of the population. 

In 2001 there was an armed conflict in which the ethnic Albanians asked for more rights like right to use Albanian as official language, Albanians to be 25% of all employed in government... That was the official reason, but there was more to that. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency_in_the_Republic_of_Macedonia

The conflict ended with agreement. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohrid_Agreement

After that, in 2002 the Albanian ""terrorists"" who were fighting against the national army were elected as members of the parliament and are part of the all governments from 2002 to now. 

Few weeks ago the Defense Minister was changed and the new minister is Albanian who was one of the ""terrorists"" who were fighting against the same army that he has to be chief now. 

The opposition parties were protesting. But when the same opposition party was in government from 2002-2006 the same Albanian was deputy Defense Minister, so their protests were hypocritical. 

After the Macedonian opposition party protested two days ago, yesterday, Albanians protested against the protest of the Macedonians and were aggressive without reason and you can see the photos in the article.

The conditions really are the crux of the matter. I wouldn't be any where near as blunt as Tubeez was being and I don't think it's right ti veto Romania and Bulgaria's entry into Schengen seeing as they're already EU members, but in principle I am against the entry of more EU states because I believe the entry requirements are far too low. Countries should have to have much better civil liberties which are much better protected and we should have much better transparency and much more stable economic plans. This should also be reciprocated on the side of the EU in that it's government needs to be *way* more transparent. If the EU had higher standards for members *and enforced those standards* then we wouldn't even be in a sovereign debt crisis. 

I'm all for uniting the European Continent. I think that is a great idea and I think it is achievable, but for god's sake don't rush it. It can be done and it can be magnificent, but if it is rushed and too many corners are cut it wont be nearly as good and it may not even last.

So, I live and work here on the farm with 4 boys who have ADD, ADHD, Mild Retardation, Extreme Behavioral Problems, all boys have suffered abuse and trauma throughout childhood, parents were drug and alcohol abusers and and and...

The way things function on the farm are less than picture perfect, far from it.

It is not my place to try to change things, I just dont want to swim those kind of waters, so I just simply said the other truth, I am alone and depressed here, there is nothing to do and no way to get out, I have no personal space. 

SO. I applied to a BFD and this was the ONLY place available ""ab sofort"", otherwise, I would have to keep working at the hellhole and I do not want that. 

Additionally, its not really a last resort thing, the position offered is wonderful because it is an activities coordinator and social contact for the elderly there. I study tourism management/convention, event and hotel management and this is perfect, where as my current position offers me nothing for my studies.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I disagree. The reason the Cold War Space Race didn't achieve much in the long term or of long term value was because of the reasons they were racing. They wanted to use space for a military advantage. If the goal was some thing different and some thing less about damage and more about progress then I doubt the space program would have (in the long term) failed so badly. If there were long term goals like (long term) financial gain or the collection of rare minerals then the race would (and could) turn out differently.

Sure, had there been such imaginary incentives. But there obviously wasn't. And there still hasn't been such incentives for human space flight. 

It should be quite a rare mineral for anyone to launch people to space to harvest it for profit. And it might very well be more cost effective to develop new competing techonologies to supplant or supercede it with much cheaper Earthly solutions. 

ATM we need no raw materials from asteroids or space which we don't already have here on Earth or couldn't produce here - there's simply no demand for space stuff. Could change in the future but for the rare if unit cost will be imperative.

&gt; I believe that is what is happening with all the private companies at the moment. They're all trying to get up to space and make a profit in a long term fashion. So that they can continually see financial returns for the foreseeable future. That's one reason why I think this will work better than it did previously.

Sure, which company wouldn't try and make profit. For private companies the biggest profit has been in LEO and GEO satellite launches as these actually bring value to their customers. The current hardware and the services it provides is valued at hundreds of billions. 

There's long term profit right there and has been for decades. For decades private companies have been providing lauch services with their rockets and making profits. Launching satellites is a big business, and it is useful and valuable to us all. Easily worth billions.

Human space flight is another business altogether. There are only few humans who are able and willing to pay for a suborbital flight and even fewer who would pay for a longer stay in orbit. Yet there are such persons as some examples show with private  Soyuz launches, but it has not been big business even for Roscosmos. 

It might be a viable business model to provide suborbital human space flights for fun experience, but the very companies that for years have claimed to do it haven't actually delivered. 

Not to mention harder by magnitude orbital flights or staying on orbit with envisioned space hotels and all. Might happen some time, might not. Lotsa promises and marketing speak there but actual delivery has actually been zero. 

So far only Roscosmos has delivered, not private companies.

&gt; I also disagree with you on the notions of cost. The reason it costs so much now is because of our extremely primitive launcher technologies. ie strapping a load of expensive fuel and expensive rockets to a small pod and lighting it. 

Primitive compared to what? Somebody's vision?

It actually is the cutting edge. If there was a better or more cost effective way with current tech we would already use it.

Rockets are expensive, as you say. But the fuel is not, it's just a tiny fraction of the cost of launch. Fuel is only expensive when you have to carry it to the orbit and beoynd. It's the mass that costs. Hence the ideas of using resources on Moon or asteroids to make rocket fuel there (ISRU). The hope is that it would be cheaper to refuel there instead of launching all your fuel from Earth's deep gravity well. It might be some day, might not. But no gas stations on Moon now, and no actual plans of a BP station making profit there either.

As it's the rocket that's expensive, and not the fuel, reusability of rocket stages could very well be effective way to bring the launch costs down. This is also what Elon Musk's SpaceX is pursuing but hasn't delivered yet. He has made a lot of marketing noise and promises about it, and if SpaceX actually delivers it could be a huge step ahead. We'll see. I remain skeptical as he has always talked about cheap spaceflight but so far has actually developed the most expensive system of delivering cargo to ISS ever. (Good for him, of course)

Now reusability is a whole other field of problems, and there's a good reason why no private launcher companies have seriously pursued that yet (excluding some small scale prize events). LEO or GEO scale reusability needs some serious investement to design and infrastructure for refurbishment. You're looking at tens to hundreds of launches with that same rocket for reusability to be profitable. Expendable rockets have been cheaper for a reason. That might change in future, but despite some vocal promises from the ""new space"" no actual delivery there either.

&gt; National space agencies are working on cheaper alternatives and so are private companies. The Skylon project is my favourite example with its single stage to launch mechanism which will make space flight (above LEO) over ten times cheaper once the technology has been safety tested. It's already been proven to work in theory.

""proven to work in theory"", very good for them. My point was: *but haven't actually delivered*

&gt; Resources aren't a problem in the long term. 

Yet some think we should travel to space to look for them.

&gt; The problem is our current methods which are obviously primitive and ineffective. Space travel will not always be expensive and that's where the real frontier is. Making space flight cheaper. We're fast on our way to doing that. 

Honestly, I haven't seen much breakthroughs in making space flight actually cheaper: not for satellites, not for ISS cargo, not for humans. Private companies have been competing and working on it for decades and have actually brought the costs down already. Now some vocal owners of new companies have made some loud promises of cheaper by magnitudes and call it ""New Space"", but haven't actually delivered.

&gt; What I do agree with pooling is certain aspects of our technologies as those are more scarce, but only certain aspects.

Yeah, I can see that. But why do that if there's no one to pay for them super secret techs in the first place. That's why I said pooling resources. Effectively it means first and foremost money, and pooling your development costs.

&gt; Additionally, the reason we're going into space this time is not for nationalistic ""We can do it, so we must!"" typed reasons. This time we're going to with a much heavier focus on benefitting humanity. We're not just going to go to Mars and see, well we've done that let's call it quits. This time it'll be followed through with more profitable ventures for the companies and governments involved like that space mining company founded, among others, by Larry Page the founder of Google. A lot of these companies gains are already visible in the satellite industry.

I really can't envision a more stupid business plan than to harness Mars' resources and try and make a profit selling them here on Earth. The only way you could make profit with the stuff you're mining there is to sell to it to the Martians themselves, not launch it to Earth. So first you'd need some Martians to sell them something at your exorbitant prices.  Alas, no Martians there to buy it. Achieving both Martians and your mining stuff would be rather expensive business endeavour.",0,1362342777,null,0,1362343091,0,c8p2lpw,t3_19ij7t,t1_c8p2lpw,t1_c8ozfyn,null,1435575936,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Because, as everyone knows, telephone services can only be provided with copper cables.

Do you happen to have even a vague idea how mobile telephone network works? Hint; the ""wireless"" part is just till the nearest antenna. After that, it relies on copper cables. The situation is relatively good in Finland/Sweden, but for example in many parts of US you can only get one cable company offering Internet. Because, you know, natural monopoly. 

Of the four or five operators national operators, two service my (highly populated) area, and only two can offer service. And this is after laws making sharing those wires mandatory.

&gt;Today, we have private telecom companies providing high quality worldwide video telephony services for free (e.g. Skype).

Skype also relies on copper wiring. You are paying for the copper wiring in the cable/DSL; Skype might offer free calls, but it's still a business and it does bill people. And true, life is easier. I do remember what it was like making international calls 20 years ago. 

&gt;Does it or does it not fall out of the sky for free?

It does, at that! There's also a lot in lakes, most of it even drinkable. But the thing is, it doesn't rain all the time and I don't live next to a lake. There's a free water post outside, but carrying water in and storing it isn't half as convenient as opening tab and drinking directly from it. We did that hundred years ago (and that's why there's that water post outside), but there's a reason why we don't use it anymore.

Chemical water purification at the end-point isn't, for limitations of space, half as efficient and the results aren't half as good as doing it centrally (you know, economies of scale). But this isn't really the point.

The point is that creating the piping and making the water flow through them is really expensive undertaking. And I'm quoting wikipedia now;

&gt; A natural monopoly by contrast is a condition on the cost-technology of an industry whereby it is most efficient (involving the lowest long-run average cost) for production to be concentrated in a single firm. In some cases, this gives the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, an overwhelming cost advantage over other actual and potential competitors. This tends to be the case in industries where capital costs predominate, creating economies of scale that are large in relation to the size of the market, and hence high barriers to entry; **examples include public utilities such as water services.**

The quality of water is just a nice perk. They can offer clean water, the best in the world, so why shouldn't they? The raw material is plenty good already, it's cheap to provide (also, this is a point of pride). Also there's something to be said for water that doesn't make you sick if accidentally digested. 


&gt;A large percentage of your tax money goes towards paying for wars.  If you disagree with those wars on ethical grounds...

Sweden (and please note that I have a Finnish flag next to my name) hasn't been in war for 200 years. Military (peacekeeping) operations in both of these countries tend to have good support from population and I don't believe we've been thought as invaders in operation countries either (before making the mistake of going to Afganistan, where we are mixed up with Americans). We haven't fought any Vietnams. 

Finland still has conscription, but only professional soldiers get to volunteer to leave for peacekeeping. There have been talks about if conscription is necessary, but we also had these talks in 1930s, which didn't really end that well for us (you know, Soviet Invasion, having to ally with Nazis for want of guns and ammo etc). The Finnish past is a big reason for how Sweden has handled their defence as well. The TL;DR is that conscription is just a tax among many. It's not ideal, but there aren't any alternatives. 

Nowadays Sweden has a professional army. Finland doesn't. Seeing as how Russian media still talks about ""taking Finland"" or more subtly ""Russian laws trumping Finnish on Finnish ground"", there's a good reason for this.

Maybe bulgaria does, I do not know exactly how your culture is over there, but Fyromians often say that history means nothing and only modern interpreation of history counts. . . so for example if they want to say that Ancient Spartans were the ancestors of modern FYROM, then it would be justified to them since they can bend and create history to suit there ideology. 

In the end, Macedonia is not something that can be shared. Alexanders birthplace is known, it is in the heartland of greece next to Thessaloniki. Ancient Macedonia is still in the same exact area of Modern Macedonia centered around Thessaloniki and this area has always been called Macedonia since before Alexanders time till today. The ancient macedonians have a direct link to modern day greece and many greeks consider them the founders of modern day greece, as Alexanders father destroyed the city-state structure of Greece and created a unified country and armed forces.

THe blood that was spilled in Persia all the way to Afghanistan during Alexanders conquests was greek blood, and no historical revisionism will ever change that.

That creates actual participation by the populace, understanding of the democratic process, the need to balance public vs. private interest, etc. 

In contrast to that, in all of Germany, even if the local popular-vote system isn't a fig leaf (like in Hesse), the parliaments have full legislation, while popular votes are barred from voting on certain topics. Which includes, everywhere, the budget, but also things that actually should be popular-vote only, like zoning.

Der Name hat zwei Bestandteile.

Der erste stammt von dem mittelhochdeutschen Verb „wegen“, mit Bedeutungen wie „(sich) bewegen“, „in Bewegung setzen“, „schütteln“, „wiegen“, „wägen“, „einschätzen“, „Gewicht/Zahl/Wert haben“, von althochdeutschen Wort „wegan“, das noch weiter in die germanischen Sprachen zurückverfolgt werden kann.

Der zweite stammt von dem mittelhochdeutschen Substantiv „houbet“, „houpt“ mit der Bedeutung „Haupt“, „Kopf“, vom althochdeutschen Substantiv „houbit“, das ebenfalls weiter in die germanischen Sprachen zurückverfolgt werden kann.

Bei der Bedeutung deutscher Nachnamen/Familiennamen helfen Nachschlagewerke weiter, die in Bibliotheken stehen (gewöhnlich in einer Sachgruppe Deutsch bzw. Germanistik eingeordnet).

Disclaimer : I am left-leaning, so I may be biased, but please do judge based on the facts.

[Golden Dawn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_(Greece\) ) is a neo-nazi party (they claim it, I am not extrapolating). They are a new formation, that swallowed the far-right votes. They have 18/300 seats in parliament. In polls, they are third.

[SYRIZA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_of_the_Radical_Left) is called radical left, because they wanted to cancel a part of the Greek debt before people accepted it was inevitable and they refuse the austerity imposed by the Europe and IMF (which is changing its opinion on this whole austerity thing btw). They are the most moderate party that refuses the austerity. The big left wing party accepts it. They have 71/300 seats in parliament. In polls, they now are first.

Now, have these parties risen? Golden Dawn is new, and makes now between 10 and 20% in polls. Less that far-right parties in most of Europe. Sure, the far-right in my country does not have people labeling themselves neo-nazi, but they are holocaust deniers. Excuse me of not thinking the difference to be that big...

The ""far-left"", however, has exploded and will probably win next elections. They are not a violent party, contrary to New Dawn (whose representatives [attack opponents physically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqUDvjak54o), and have militias in the street).

Why is it that medias talk more about New Dawn, which makes unimpressive scores in elections, than about Syriza, which *is* a revolution in Greek politics? They don't like the story that big mainstream parties have been **totally** discredited by the way they handled the crisis (the PASOK went from 40+% to 7.2% in three years.) That more than the rise of hate and xenophobia, or radical ideas, this is an example of democracy at work : pushing out the bad leaders.

I have seen the blackout about how Iceland and Ireland handled the crisis (not really handled by radical leftists, by the way).

Technically, their kids. Kindergeld. 

Germany mostly doesn't give a rat's ass about what passport a kid on its soil has. Obligation to go to school, social services, all rights, etc.

The issue here is that Kindergeld for one kid is twice as much as they make over in Romania. But when you get down to it, the problem is smaller than right-wingers want you to think, and the problems we have in some quarters in some cities could be easily squashed if and only if the municipalities would have the money to do that: When you compare the Bulgarian/Romanian immigrants to native Germans, the former actually have a *lower* rate of unemployment as the latter.

...municipalities having no money being a structural problem, in Germany: Not enough tax revenue, and their finances are very much tied to the local economy, which means that if they're fucked, they stay fucked. And even if they have a local economy, companies can apply tricks to pay their taxes somewhere else, where the tax is lower. Some municipalities *aren't even allowed* to launch any programmes to solve the problems at hand because they're so deep into the red that they lost their budget autonomy.

Sure, it's right to complain that EU money is seeping away into corrupt pockets in the poorer countries. But we need to solve *both* problems, because the situation ain't going to change itself, and letting those quarters stay like they are right now would only serve to make them future banlieue, with even more fuckup.

I disagree with this aspect, you can't force anything upon the people, even if it's done with good intentions and for the benefit of all - that just leads to resentment and doesn't actually solve the issue.

More direct democracy, however, solves this issue, the people collectively decide what they want on a case to case basis instead of having a very limited choice with regards to political parties (and having to choose as a bundle, not allowed to pick and choose the good policies) and leave the unimportant rest to the politicians (again, I point to Switzerland which has worked so well for so long).

Are the Czechs and Poland out of Shengen ? No, they're in. Which contributed a lot to decrease corruption and poverty and crime. There was also agreements with them predating, but along the same lines, which did help too.

You don't solve the issue by walling people out instead of helping them. It'll only make them poorer.

&gt; They've only themselves to blame for not being able to do the same.

If there isn't any money in their country and their about-only trade partner decide that no they ain't gonna get any money; poverty will never disappear. Those country have *nobody* else to trade with who has any sort of money. And the russian would use any given lever to force them back under their thumb so they will refuse any form of huge trade agreement with the russian too (at least not without EU backing); by fear of becoming satellite states again. If we refuse to trade with them they are just gonna starve. It's almost criminal.

&gt; If you feel that way you should pay. Why should money be squandered on these two black sheep when there are other countries that proved themselves much more worthy. Would you invest in a gifted child or in a retard?

Would you let any of your kids starve if you had bof a gifted kid and a retard ? No, you take care of both.
Also for the same reason some towns loose money while other bring money in. And we don't cut those out of our respective country. Romania and Bulgaria are still an European country, and as such shouldn't be left out on the roadside just because they are in a difficult situation.

Imagine too if greece did bankrupt and we never helped them ? They're still on the verge of it, but if it *actually happens* you'd instantly get a country in a somalian-level situation where the gov won't pay anyone and then brutally the whole systeme cease to exist overnight because there are no cops, firefighters, school or electric power to just light things on, because nobody is there to do it nor paid for it.

Now i'm pretty sure i'd rather pay bigger taxes and we'd loose money to rebuild some european countries than learn some people are leaving in shanties north-korea style and tens of thousands dying from cold and hunger every years just a few hundred km from my home; just because we were to greedy and haughty to help them. 

As for not throwing money in a bottomless pits there are others way to fix the issue imho. Such as economic gardianship. What i mean by that is litterally (in the case of greece) giving the economic control to maybe germany or some european comission, with wide discretionnary powers to root out corruption and ensure money goes to proper use (school, social programs, actual infrastructure) and not buying new cars to the local oligarchs. Until they get their economy back on track or at least for a few years. Might be a little humiliating for the local gov but better than starvation imho :/",1,1362360656,null,0,1362361578,0,c8p832g,t3_19kqs2,t1_c8p832g,t1_c8p7khc,null,1431473505,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Secondly, your definition of ""charging a premium"" is not consistent with any dictionary definition.  Nowhere is it defined as ""beyond reasonable"".  It's just a sum added to an ordinary charge.

You've been exposed to what exactly? Communist or people complaining about the communists? I think the latter. I doubt you've seen more than a few ""so-called"" communists.

Look, there are communist parties all over Europe, it's not just a Czech thing. People always like and liked big honorable ideas which offer simple honorable solutions. And history taught us that people do not learn from history. During the communist regime in Czechoslovakia there was about 10-15 % of people in the ""upper class"" living good and happy lives - for the price of being rats, informers and denouncers. Also there were people who just did what they were told to do and had their security (cars, education...) and they were simply too weak to function in a free market based society. And so a big percentage of these people vote the communist party still and ofcourse a lot of their children do also. The reason why communists got such a big percentage of the votes is because their supporters always come to vote and are dutiful which can't be said about average right-wing voter.
