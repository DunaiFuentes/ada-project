As above, the French are extremely pride and very concerned with manners. Add to this that most foreigners experience of 'France' is Paris, a city which is overcrowded and where, everwhere you turn, you bump into an American wearing sweatpants and a baseball cap asking 'Hey excuse me, how do you get to *No-tra Dayme*. I've spent a lot of time in Paris and unfortunately this combination tends to turn Parisians into rude and snobbish people, who don't tolerate tourists who don't know how things work. 

Having said that, even the rest of France considers Parisians a special breed - snobbish and unwelcoming. 

The French people expect to be able to do whatever they want, whenever they want, as they are very 'self-reliant' – they like to determine their own lives. However they all expect the state to pick up the pieces and clear up after them. The French are extremely demanding of quality from government services. Administration is slow (a constant source of bane in all French people's lives!) but the actual service provided is usually universally considered to be of good quality and efficient. This includes Public Transit, Healthcare, Schools, Welfare payments, childcare. In France, if you are a single mother, the government will pay for you to have a cleaner 2 or 3 times a week to do your cleaning and ironing and washing. Because French people expect that the state should look after them, and when everything goes wrong (they get hit by a car) the state should pick up the pieces. 

This is also coupled with a very strong sense of 'Solidarity' – the belief that we are all responsible for each other. 

These may sound contradictory but they are actually linked in the French psyche. 

Also, yes, teaching oneself some French manners before heading to the country will work wonders, as will learning some French.

* The words are chosen in a haphazard way with no rules whatsoever. No allophones, contractions, elisions, sandhi or other rules that would make it conform to a consistent set of rules are defined. This may result in complex consonant clusters or long chains of vowels and makes it sound unnatural and difficult to speak. (even leaders of Esperanto promoting organizations don't really sound fluent.)

* No effort was made to ensure that the words sound sufficiently distinct. Intonation is not defined. This could lead to serious misunderstandings.

3\. It promotes bad learning methods. Esperanto is relatively easy to learn mechanically, which is generally the worst way of learning a language that rarely leads to fluency. (this could be another reason why nobody seems to speak it fluently)

4\. It has no advantages over natural languages:

* If it becomes widely spoken, it will inevitably gain lots of naive speakers and it won't be a neutral choice any more.

At any rate, this thing would not have happened if it wasn't for the crisis the this austerity response to it by the European institutions, so you can't really say the issues are unrelated.

true,sir_rob,Bourgogne,Bourgogne,"I think there are multiple origins.

- One is the French tourists tend to be, like quite a lot of other tourists actually, seen as rude, because they tend not to learn the ways of the country they go to, or the language. I actually had problems when I went to Japan with my mother, as she - contrary to me - did not know how Japan works. So she made mistakes.

- Second dates - I think - from WW2. People from all over the globe descended on France (Kiwis, GIs, Bruces...) and did not understand why those bloody Frenchmen that had lost the war were pissed that their ""liberators"" were drinking all the wine, eating all the meat and driving around like madmen. That's not my opinion but rather the one found in US military manuals about France at the time.

- Third comes from historical conflict. The British are seen as the ""perfide Albion"", enemies for a whole lot of centuries. The German tried to invade us twice in the XXth century. The US worked against French interests for a good part of the 1950s, and also were all pissy about the fact that France wanted to be independent from NATO and didn't want any US bases on its soil. Those sentiments tend to linger around in the common view. It got kind of re-ignited when the French government told President Bush that he could go to Iraq all by himself. That sparked anti-French sentiment in the US, mirrored by anti-American sentiment in France.

- Fourth comes from lack of understanding. France works around the ""proper"" way to do things. If you don't, you are seen as rude regardless of what language you speak and where you come from. That also means that there is a proper way to approach people and speak to them, which is most likely not known by outsiders.

- Fifth is Paris. It's a lovely city, but like every giant metropolis on earth, you find rude people, people that are too busy to take 5 minutes to explain to you in detail how to go someplace and will most likely not speak your language. Some take it as a personal attack against them. It's just how the big city works. Deal with it.

- In France wait staff is actually properly paid, and any tips are extra. From that stems two problems :

1/ French people overseas seem rude because they don't automatically tip. That's because in France the wait staff doesn't live on tips. In France you tip average+ to awesome service.

2/ French wait staff doesn't feel the need to be extra nice to you for tips. Especially if you go to a bar or restaurant at rush hour. Because they have to work at full speed and can't take a few minutes to be extra-duper lovely to you.

That being said, I know of quite a few place where service is bad and the staff very rude.

EDIT :

- Also French people don't like criticism from the foreigners. It's a broken country, but it's our broken country.

Government issued an emergency decree [of dubious legaility](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1g9dvr/the_situation_is_greece_is_out_of_hand/cajtpkz) to shut down public broadcasting company ERT last Tuesday, effective immediately after the end of that day's programme. The plan was for ERT to shut down for a few months and re-open under a new company name with severely reduced personnel. 

The employees decided not to leave their posts and have since been trying [to keep the broadcast alive](http://www3.ebu.ch/cms/en/sites/ebu/contents/news/2013/06/monitor-ert-online.html). The government did everything in its power to stop the signal from being broadcast or relayed by other TV stations. 

Since then, the two junior coalition partners of the government have said that they do not support this decision, a crowd has began gathering every day outside the studios where ERT is still recording their broadcasts, the [Directors general of 50 European TV and radio broadcasters have signed a petition against the decision](http://www.reddit.com/tb/1gemjs) and the [Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights has strongly condemned the decision](http://www.reddit.com/tb/1gbno7). 

The issue is twofold: On one hand, it's about whether it is right for the public broadcasting company to shut down, even temporarily. On the other hand, the undemocratic means in which the decision was reached and implemented is criticised.

In that respect its still quite classist, because people with good jobs, if they are made unemployed or fall ill, get more money back from the system (and a bigger pension at the end) than those who had minimum wage jobs, who get less back.

Xavi hasn't looked fit enough for a starting spot recently, I'd rather he came in as a sub.  Pedro's recent form for Spain has been unreal so he certainly deserves a start.

* Our new government has announced a stop to EU membership negotiations, but they might hold a referendum on weather we should continue them but to be honest, I think the only way we as a country will continue the negotiation is in four years with a new government.

* The Progressive Party's promise of correcting consumer loans seems to have been less obvious than they made us believe, they have yet to show the people the plan and the only thing they've done is setting up a committee to find ways to do it.

Un quadro dal valore già di 30 volte più alto è praticamente impossibile che perda valore anzi raddoppierà o triplichera il suo valore in 10 anni. 
Ricordo i quadri di Fontana che compravi 10-12 anni fa in tv, ma spendevi già il prezzo di un auto.. Li avresti investiti su una tela tagliata?

Vladimir Putin with his power, duties, schedule, responsibilities, and activities conspired to steal a NFL Superbowl ring from the team owner of a sport that no one outside the US even acknowledges?  Putin likely wanted shake his hand and get him out of his sight as quickly as possible.

Kraft initially stated that the ring was a gift.


On Thursday at an award gala in New York Kraft stated:

""""I took out the ring and showed it to (Putin). And he put it on and he goes, 'I can kill someone with this ring,'"" Kraft said, according to the New York Post. ""I put my hand out and he put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out.""


Such a cliche, unoriginal, and lame attempt to characterize Putin.  Kraft not having the wits to use FSB as the KGB ceased to exist in 1991.


CNN uses the tabloid journal NY Post as a source, owned by Rupert Murdoch as well as FOX News.  FOX News is obsessed whether Putin desires to be Tzar, Soviet Premier, outdo Nazi fascism, or crazed dictator out to steal all the money in the world.

More debates around changing the Constitution. [Here is last weeks stuff](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1fz4ar/sunday_european_news_series_what_happened_in_your/caf7anx).

* So remember the amendment that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman alone, effectively banning gay marriage? They decided not to include it after all (apparently last week's vote was on ""on principle"". This week's was the real deal). So theoretically, a legalisation of gay marriage won't need a constitutional amendment in the future.

* OTOH, the proposed amendment to forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation got scraped as well.

* Because we had [a referendum in 2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_parliamentary_reform_referendum,_2009) calling for unicameralism and a maximum of 300 MPs, which the current coalition is ignoring, the president said he will call a referendum on these issues once more. (The referendum was non-binding, passed with a wide margin - over 75% for - but was seen as a populist move made by the president, as he called it at the same time as the presidential elections, to take advantage of anti-parliament sentiment)

Are they bribing vote counters to throw away opposition votes?  (illegal)

Are they paying voters for votes?  (illegal)

Aka Fox news, CNN, MSNBC and more of them. And they are buying elections by simply outspending everyone else or refusing to debate people
(for an example Obama had 1 billion $ to spend on his last campaign)

(they collect millions from their wealthy masters and spend them to bamboozle the public and buy elections)
Aka buys ads everywhere or pays somebody to announce they support X candidate or such things.

You keep saying America isn't a democracy.  Now you are saying Obama received the majority of votes.   These are contradictory statements.  Obama being the president because the majority of citizens voted him in = democracy.  

&gt;And they are buying elections by simply outspending everyone else or refusing to debate people (for an example Obama had 1 billion $ to spend on his last campaign)

That's not buying elections.  That's buying ad time in the hopes of receiving votes.  Buying elections is spending money to rig an election, or paying voters to vote a certain way.  Spending ad money doesn't necessarily mean people will believe the ads, and thus doesn't mean that parties are buying votes.

[Here's](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2658319/) an Australian study on violence against paramedics, choice quote:

&gt;It is clear that almost half the paramedics experienced verbal abuse a few times in the last 12 months, and one third experienced intimidation a few times in the last 12 months. Just over 3% of paramedics reported experiencing verbal abuse on a daily basis and approximately 12% about once a week.

And the background for the study:

&gt;International studies have shown that some 60% of paramedics have experienced physical violence in the workplace, and between 21–78% have experienced verbal abuse. To date, there is no Australian literature describing Australian paramedics' experience of workplace violence.

Another study in [Canada](http://www.emsworld.com/article/10618904/cruisin-for-a-bruisin-violence-stalks-canadian-medics), says this:

&gt;But consider the implications of a recent investigation into workplace violence against paramedics in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Nova Scotia: It found more than 26% of respondents there had experienced physical abuse on the job within the last year.

and

&gt;The data came from 1,381 medics surveyed during CME sessions in 2011. More than 92% said the violence came from their patients, but others cited patients’ families and friends, bystanders and even colleagues as its sources.

and also

&gt;How would such rates stack up against the average American system’s? For what it’s worth, in a late-’90s survey of a major U.S. fire-EMS department (Albuquerque), 90% of respondents said they’d been subject to violence or assault in their careers.1 Around that same time in Southern California, another survey found 61% had been assaulted on the job.2 More recently, a study from Australia pegged it at 87.5%.3

Democracy is a form of government.  Plutocracy is not a form of government.  Plutocracy simply means who has control.  These two ideas are not mutually exclusive.  It stands to reason that the wealthiest will have the most power in almost *any* system of governance.

You didn't state *""Honestly no I do not think there really exist a true democracy anywhere""* in the beginning, so don't be mistaken in thinking your position was quite clear by changing your thesis in your latest post.

Here's what happened, in plain words. The government made the labour laws more flexible by extending the work time accounting period from 4 to 12 months ""if justified by objective or technical reasons related to organization of work"". Accounting period is the length of time over which the average number of hours worked per day has to match the standard 8 hours. Thus, you can work longer hours for a few months and then work less (or not at all) for the remaining time. Any such arrangement must be collectively approved by the employees, through unions or otherwise.

The rationale is that in some industries the amount of work done varies a lot over time. Consider agriculture or construction for good examples. If employees always had to work 8 hour days, companies would be understaffed half the time and overstaffed the other half, which is obviously very inefficient. In practice, companies in such positions just hire people temporarily instead of full-time.

Hence, extending the accounting period is meant to make jobs more stable and allow companies to be more efficient and competitive. How much it serves the employees and how much the employers is, of course, a question for debate.

I personally think it's good for everybody. The article kindly linked by the OP presents an alternative viewpoint:

&gt; This is a major attack to the working class, smuggled by with little notice of the world press and little protest of the collaborationist unions.

I generally disagree with your thesis, but the one point that really does piss me off about the US is how they fucked us over in regards to the Empire.  Wilson, FDR, Eisenhower undermining us and then claim they are the saviours of WW2 (and the more historically illiterate even think they had something to do with WW1) thinking that their war profiteering was somehow noble.

Who openly support Terrorism against the Country that is supposed to be your closest Ally, so who gives a fuck?  

&gt;Germany would have crushed you guys had we not gotten involved

By the time the US got involved in Europe the RAF and Royal Navy had effectively beaten their German Counterparts.  The V1 and V2s and U boats were more of an annoyance than what the History channel makes them out to be. Britain was doing a pretty good job at chipping away at the flanks of the axis before an American ever set foot on European soil in Norway and North Africa.  

&gt;you seem to be forgetting that we had to beat Japan back off all the colonies they took from you by ourselves

The biggest and saddest myth about the War.  Britain (and by the British I mean the Empire) did more against the Japanese in any single theatre than the Americans did in their piddly little Island hoping campaign. That theatre, that few Americans have ever heard of, was BURMA, the longest running campaign of the War and the one with the most Japanese, around 500,000 as opposed to a few thousand on any given island.

I wont bother trying to convince you of the Glory that was the Falklands.

&gt;I get that that you're very proud of brutally subjugating over 400 million people

The thing about the Empire was that it didnt so much subjugate the countries as make them better. We brought stability, prevented ethnic and religious conflict and increased standard of living everywhere we went.    This might be hard concept for an American to grasp filled with absolute rubbish about 1776 and the forefathers and all that nonsense.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*In December 1940, after Prime Minister Winston Churchill informed Roosevelt that Great Britain could not pay for supplies, the president crafted a new initiative. The U.S. would “lend” Great Britain matériel and Britain would repay the United States through various means to be determined later. This program, known as Lend-Lease, became law on March 11, 1941.*

*The Lend-Lease program was stunningly successful in getting much-needed supplies to the Allies and keeping them in the war. In 1941 alone, more than 1,000,000 tons of food were shipped overseas. Great Britain received almost $700,000,000 worth of goods including munitions, raw materials, tools, fire-fighting equipment, food, vitamins for children, medical supplies, and tractors in just the first three months of 1943. From 1942 to September 1945, the Soviet Union received 9,000 tanks or self-propelled guns, 362,000 trucks, 47,000 jeeps, 131,633 submachine guns, 3,000 rocket launchers, 14,000,000 boots, 532,000 tons of U.S. sugar, 485,000 tons of canned meat (i.e., Spam) and hundreds of other items. Twenty percent of the Lend-Lease supplies the Soviets received were military, while the rest were food, metals, chemicals, petroleum products, and factory machinery.*

true,chiwawa_42,null,null,"Je vais essayer de démystifier un peu la situation. Source : mon job est de fabriquer des opérateurs IP.


Historiquement (dans le monde du téléphone), les opérateurs tiraient des liens entre eux et maillaient en fonction d'accords d'achat/revente de minutes. Tout le trafic était systématiquement payant, sauf accords maginaux.

Dans le monde moderne, celui des réseaux par paquets dont fait partie IP, on ne peut pas compter et valoriser tous les paquets, donc quand on valorise, c'est sur la base d'une capacité de transport d'information. On achète une capacité de lien, avec éventuellement une part fixe (le commit) et une part variable (le burst), ce dernier étant mesuré avec la méthode du [95eme percentile](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/95e_centile).

Chaque opérateur sur Internet est identifié par un numéro d'AS (Autonomous System) et les préfixes (blocs d'adresses) dont il dispose.

Exemples : [Orange](http://as.robtex.com/as3215.html), [Free](http://as.robtex.com/as12322.html), [OVH](http://as.robtex.com/as16276.html), [Alsatis](http://as.robtex.com/as48072.html)

Il existe deux types d'interconnexions entre opérateurs :

* Le peering : chaque opérateur annonce à son pair tout ou partie des préfixes qui composent son réseau et les préfixes des réseaux qui payent cet opérateur pour du transit.

* Le transit : l'opérateur transitaire (upstream) annonce à son client (cust) tous les préfixes qui constituent Internet, et reçoit de son client uniquement les préfixes qui composent son propre réseau (et ses clients éventuels, le ""customer-cone"", décrit dans son AS-Set)

Deux réseaux peuvent s'interconnecter à plusieurs endroits géographiquement dispersés. Dans le cas d'interconnexions multiples, si chacun annonce toutes ses routes, alors les paquets suivront la route dite ""de la patate chaude"", c'est à dire celle lui permettant de sortir le plus rapidement de son réseau source, pour rejoindre le plus rapidement possible le réseau de destination. Ca implique que l'opérateur de destination transporte le paquet de son point d'entrée jusqu'à sa destination, ce qui peut être cher dans le cas de réseaux intercontinentaux.

Pas mal d'informations sur les peerings peuvent être trouvées sur [PeeringDB](https://www.peeringdb.com/login.php?ret_link=%2F&amp;type=notLogged). Attention, les interconnexions privées et accords secrets n'y seront évidement pas.

Des optimisations peuvent être faites, dans le cadre d'accords d'interconnexion spécifiques, pour aller contre le fonctionnement naturel et router en ""patate froide"", c'est à dire que l’émetteur du paquet achemine celui-ci aussi près que possible de sa destination. Ca demande un haut niveau de coopération entre les deux opérateurs.


Le problème que vous rencontrez, à savoir les ralentissements réguliers sur des sites de vidéo, ont une explication assez simple : un des deux protagoniste refuse l'augmentation de capacité des tuyaux interconnectant les deux réseaux, pour des raisons souvent économiques, si ce n'est politique.

Une bonne conférence pour expliquer le fond du problème est celle de [Benjamin Bayart aux RMLL2007, intitulée ""Internet Libre ou Minitel 2.0""](http://www.kafe-in.net/Conferences/#rmll2007-bayart). Mais dans les grandes lignes, ça se résume en quelques lignes.

Du point de vue de Orange / Free : leur boulot est de faire des trous dans les rues, poser des câbles, fournir des boxs, de la hotline, tout ça pour 30€/mois. Il faut beaucoup de monde, beaucoup de capital, c'est pas aussi rentable que...

Du point de vue d'un fournisseur de service (Facebook / Google / Meetic / ...) : le boulot est de fabriquer un service, raquer quelques serveurs pour le faire tourner, et raccorder ces serveurs à Internet, pour toucher des revenus de pub ou des abonnements.

Certains fournisseurs d'accès veulent leur part du gâteau que représente les services, et prennent pour ça leur abonnés en otage, en disant aux fournisseurs de service ""si tu veux joindre mes abonnés correctement, tu dois me donner du pognon"". En droit français, ""je peux te nuire donc tu me donne du pognon"", ça s'appelle du racket. Mais en droit commercial international, c'est semble-t-il légal.

En terme de légitimité, vous pourriez, en tant qu’abonné à un FAI, considérer que votre abonnement couvre les frais d'interconnexion, qui ne représentent jamais plus d'1% du montant total de l'abonnement (un lien 10G en transit, donc plus cher en théorie que du peering, ça coute moins de 5k€/mois et ça suffit à 50 000 vues simultanées en streaming 360p)

Du coup, en laissant les interconnexions saturer, les fournisseurs d'accès font pression sur le marché du service en donnant l'illusion que les services de qualité se trouvent chez ceux qui les payent. Dailymotion est l'un des premiers en France a avoir outé ce chantage et l'a fait savoir en affichant le numéro de la hotline de SFR en frontpage pour leurs abonnés, et ce peu après avoir subi le même chantage de la part de Free.

Il y a donc bien des accords d'interconnexions. Entre Orange et Google, ça représente quelque chose comme 60Gbps, peut être le double, les chiffres sont tenus secrets. Entre Free et Google, il y a eu 40Gbps, mais depuis que l'ARCEP a voulu mettre son nez dedans, les interconnexions ne se réalisent plus qu'à létranger, pour que les magouilles restent cachées.

Entre Orange et Google il y a une anecdote assez amusante : Google voyant les tuyaux saturer, ils ont demandé un upgrade à Orange. Orange a rétorqué que ""ce coup ci ce serait payant (et cher) parce que le trafic est très asymétrique"" (normal : les abonnés Orange envoient de petites requêtes pour recevoir des grosses vidéos, mais les juristes en charge du dossier n'ont pas besoin d'être de bonne foi).

Google a refusé de payer, et a répondu à Orange ""bha non, ce sera gratuit, sinon ça va ramer et tes abonnés seront pas contents. D'ailleurs, pour la peine, on va pas allumer IPv6 sur l'interconnexion, c'est déjà plein de toute façon"".

Une des contre-mesures d'Orange _serait_ (pas de confirmation formelle) d'orienter les requêtes vers des serveurs de Google situées derrière des liens que Google paye à un transitaire, de façon à ce que ça leur coûte le plus d'argent possible. Du coup, la réponse aurait été un bridage volontaire de Google sur ses capacités de transit. Mais là ce ne sont que des spéculations.

Chez Free c'est à peu près le même topo, en un peu plus tordu : non seulement les peerings de Free sont saturés, mais les transits visiblement le sont aussi.

OVH a une position radicalement différente : historiquement, ils sont un fournisseur de service (content network) du fait des centaines de milliers de serveurs qu'ils hébergent. Du coup, leur réseau envoie beaucoup de données au reste d'Internet, et la qualité est importante donc OVH investi dans ses tuyaux. Leur activité marginale de FAI ne rempli pas l'autre sens des tuyaux, donc l'accès est généralement bien meilleur vers toutes les destinations.

D'autres opérateurs plus petits, tels que Nerim ou les membres de la [Fédération FDN](http://www.ffdn.org/) par exemple, ont une politique de peering beaucoup plus saine que les gros escrocs nationaux, et n'ont pas du tout ce genre de problème de saturation.

Even in the US, the average was around [100](http://news.discovery.com/history/history-of-the-8-hour-work-day-120501.htm) hours. 80 something hours per week in the Gulag is still almost 12 hours work per day.

You're right.

Faust flirts (quite explicitly) with a beautiful witch, who in turn is happy she has some 'apples' for him.
Mephisto then takes it up a notch and rephrases Faust's verses changing from apples to a big hole that he likes. Which the old witch says she needs a big log for.

Goethe was one dirty boy, I tell you. You can find stuff like that throughout Faust. Hence I loved it when we read it in school and then performed it in the school theatre group.

I'm not sure which is worse... your morality or your logic. But here goes...

&gt; But don't expect that those jobs would come back to developed countries, they would be done increasingly by machines and robots. Thus your solution would leave the people much worse of.

You make the assumption that European firms know that in some specific point in their supply chain, some party is using child labor. That is quite rich. They don't know, and they can't know, even if they make endless checks, there still can and will be a place that employes child labor. Not to mention where do you stop following the supply chain?

1. En lisant ta description du ""racket"" d'Orange, j'ai l'impression que le FAI contrôle le routage des paquets, non seulement dans leur propre AS, mais au travers le chemin entier des paquets en provenance des services internet. Comment cela est possible ? De ma compréhension du routage IP, chaque routeur possède des tables de routage pour son voisinage. Les paquets IP, quand ils arrivent, se réfèrent à cette table pour calculer le prochain pas. Il me semble que le seul moyen de manipuler le routage ""naturel"" des paquets serait de manipuler les tables de routage des routeurs dans le AS, pour les empêcher de voir certains chemins. Est-ce légal ?

2. Si les FAI français ont le droit de manipuler le routage des paquets, est-ce qu'il n'y a pas une possibilité, dans l'avenir, de créer un grand mur pare-feu de la France, comme en Chine ? Quel recours légal auront les utilisateurs si quelqu'un tente de faire ça (pas forcément pour des raisons politiques, peut être pour des raisons économiques ou autres) ?

3. Il paraît que les américains vivent la même chose chez eux. Le FAI Time Warner Corp., notamment, semble lui aussi réorienter les requêtes pour YouTube vers une cache locale. [Ce blog](http://mitchribar.com/2013/02/time-warner-cable-sucks-for-youtube-twitchtv/) décrit une solution qui semble marcher pour la plupart des clients de TWC. Il s'agit de bloquer avec son propre pare-feu le bloc d'adresses qui correspond à cette cache locale, ce qui oblige les paquets à retrouver le chemin défaut qui lui est très rapide. Est-ce que cette solution marchera en France ? Si oui, comment on fait pour découvrir le bloc d'adresses de la cache locale de son FAI ?

And I think Spain will at least make it to the finals, if not win the cup. Aside from Italy, I just don't see any other team that can come close to them.

* The Irish Potato famine was not just deadly because of there were not enough potatoes but because of unchecked market forces: most of the potatoes were exported, driving up the price of the potatoes consumed internally. As many people in Ireland were quite poor at that time, this lead to starvation.

Good things about it: the food is really good, specially vegetables and meat. It's a small city, you can just walk to places and nothing is more than 25 minutes.

true,talideon,CONN,Connacht,"&gt; The Irish Potato famine was not just deadly because of there were not enough potatoes but because of unchecked market forces: most of the potatoes were exported, driving up the price of the potatoes consumed internally. As many people in Ireland were quite poor at that time, this lead to starvation. 

You're half right: it was due to market forces, but not in the way you think. Potatoes weren't grown for export. They were grown on marginal land for consumption by tenant farmers. The real issue was that *all* the other produce was aggressively exported abroad, thus once the blight hit, the staple food of most of the populous was wiped out.

Interestingly, up until the blight hit, the Irish had some of the highest life expectations in Europe!

&gt; I can't speak it myself but apparently there's no direct word for ""no"".

True. You instead use the negative and positive forms of the verb in the sentence you're replying to. Thus the replies to 'Do you know X?' would be 'I know' and 'I don't know'.

Also, Irish has no verb for 'have', instead generally using what would be rendered in English as 'be..at'. Thus, 'Tá riomhaire agam' is literally 'A computer is at me', but directly translates as 'Is (a) computer at-me'.

A lot of my fellow countrymen loved to do seasonal work in Ireland during the 00s, mostly on farms.

They love their alcohol. But what northern European country doesn't?

You should edit that in as a TL;DR.

Even if it wasn't, why should I care what views your child develops on sex? Aside from the fact that pretending it doesn't exist is probably the worst possible option for developing a healthy view on sex, it's *your* job to raise your children.

I'm sorry you find sex so traumatic, perhaps it's due to that overly-sheltered childhood your parents gave you.

There are two fantastic sports known as Gaelic football (usually just called 'football' in Ireland) and hurling which are really only played in Ireland - which I think is a massive shame because they're fantastic sports. They also require **so much skill**!

Gaelic football is a bit like a mixture between rugby and football, with a bit of basketball. There's a goal at the end of the pitch which looks like [this](http://www.japangaa.com/rules/photo/goal.jpg) - you get one point for kicking the ball over the posts, and three for getting it into the goal underneath (which is guarded by a goalkeeper). But you can't just run with the ball in your hands - every 3-4 steps you have to either bounce the ball - but you can't bounce it twice in a row, or drop it to your feet and kick it back up. You also can't just throw it to a team-mate, you have to sort of punch it out of your hands; and you can't just pick it up off the ground, you have so sort of scoop it up with your foot. [Here's a video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEAbWrdB9XU)

Hurling is sort of like Gaelic football, but with sticks and a smaller ball! You score in the same way, but again, you can't just run with the ball: you either have to balance it on your stick (while running!), or hit it off your stick and catch it every 3-4 steps. It's said that hurling is the fastest ball game in the world.

In short, my area is pretty much what the NSA is keeping itself busy with. What I know from this is that in order for any agency to have context, e.g. knowing who the person is who called from country A to country B for x minutes using the words bomb, USA, etc. you need something called case attributes. This basically means that in order to link e.g. a phone number to a person's name/identity, they would need to have additional data.

For as far as I understand from all the interviews and articles about data surveillance is that they basically used metadata which means it's data about data (without actual context about you making that phone call). After they figure out there is a certain threat by a certain ""case"", then they can figure out what the case attributes are, finding the context and thus the identity.

My point is that I'm not bothered by metadata being scanned and wonder why others are. I'd be bothered by my entire life being out in the open just like that without a good reason. To use a bank as an example; once you open a bank account, bank employees will have access to all your transfers, perhaps a porn site you're paying for, your visit to that swingers club, etc. etc. Stuff they could use against you. Yet we trust these bank employees won't abuse having this information. With the metadata (which is even less ""real"" data than what this bank employee can see) why do we feel so much more bothered by this governmental surveillance stuff?

I would like to point out that I do believe that they should act according to what the law prescribes and that they should be watched in the same way as we keep a close eye on police forces to name one example. Just that once you start getting paranoid about this, believe me, this is just the tip of the ice berg. If you want to be paranoid about people being able to know what you do in your life, be a lot more paranoid than you are now, because there's a shitload of info on you available for people at different organizations.

Kay è uno dei migliori autori fantasy contemporanei e uno di quelli a cui si punta quando qualcuno afferma che il fantasy sia un genere inferiore. Nel suo paese, il Canada, è considerato parte dell'establishment letterario *tout court*. 

E' il secondo dei suoi romanzi che leggo, il primo è stato *Tigana*, il suo libro più famoso, tra l'altro è ambientato in un paese immaginario fortemente ispirato all'Italia rinascimentale. 

*A Song for Arbonne* invece è ispirato all'epoca dei trovatori francesi. L'elemento fantastico (almeno fin'ora, più o meno a metà libro) è poco presente, e piuttosto il romanzo si legge come un romanzo storico (anche se, ripeto, la geografia è del tutto immaginaria). Grande prosa, personaggi a tutto tondo, trama appassionante e fitta (anche perché Kay è uno dei pochi autori fantasy che scrive quasi sempre romanzi singoli, piuttosto che colossali serie da 7-15 libri) e alcune tematiche interessanti: la memoria, il passato che influenza il presente... 

Lo consiglio anche ai tanti fan di GRRM che ho notato sulla nostra piccola comunità, soprattutto per farvi notare che Martin non è stato, come si dice spesso, il primo a introdurre nel fantasy tematiche più adulte e maggiore ambiguità, con schemi che vadano oltre la classica lotta tra il bene e il male.

Government is seen as a partner in this process not the director or guarantor. Legislatures can pass endless laws and tax codes, however no government can tax or regulate its citizens into prosperity.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Beck's has an apostrophe problem.

The company dates back to 1873 when the apostrophe was still used in this way according to wikipedia (although international marketing was probably more crucial in this case). Apart from that, since the latest reform in 2006, it is now ""ok"" again to write ""abethebrewer's Haus"" in German again anyway. It's not a nice style in my opinion, but it's not a grammar error per se anymore to use the apostrophe for a genitive name (but only for names, and only if it's ""useful to clarify"" the basic form). 

E.g. lets take the female Andrea and the male Andreas. Before the reform this was correct:
&gt; Andreas Haus | Andreas' Haus

After the reform of 2006, both, the version I just wrote, and this new version are correct for the female form (the male stays the same in this particular example; this is also applied to surnames):
&gt; Andrea's Haus | Andreas' Haus

Some people considere this a genuflection* to the English language and the daily incorrect usage everywhere. ^(^*hopefully ^this ^is ^the ^correct ^vocabulary ^for ^""Kniefall"")

From that point onwards the state was seen as the natural source of identity rather than the church. Of course Protestantism in general helped with this by shattering the idea of religion as a hierarchy.

Dafür kannst du dir dann noch n bisschen Applaus von den anderen Minderbemittelten abholen, aber im richtigen Leben wirst du weder mit den Upvotes, den Supportern, der Grammatik und Rechtschreibung noch der stumpfen Kommunikation auch nur einen Meter weit kommen.
Für einen Fussballverein oder Türsteher reicht das vielleicht...und das kannst du ja auch gerne machen...nur es entsteht sogar der Eindruck als wüsstest du gar nicht was das Wort Kleinkind bedeutet.

true,cbfw86,UKGB,"Class clown, est. 1985","I agree that age is obviously a factor. By the age of 17 I'd expect most kids to be sexually active and even capable of having serious adult conversations about most issues in society, but I can only talk from experience in my own home growing up. For children I think porn is damaging outright (""Oh so that's what it must be for, and that's how it must be used, then""), and ages 10-15 is something of a 'danger zone', where sexuality and sexual self-perception can be determined by outside influences rather than personal chemistry.

For all our talk about social conditioning and developmental psychology we seem to draw a blanket ban on the topic of porn and kids and insist that the kids are all right, regardless of what they are seeing and how that affects them. Porn's more acceptable than it's ever been, sexual imagery is everywhere it seems (there's now a chic new drink called 'Pussy', which, while not a crime, kind of demonstrates that there's no edge to edginess any more), and it's now a multi-billion pound a year industry, and still we shy away from asking tough questions and seeking real answers about it affects on any of us, let alone kids. It seems that people are so scared of having their porn taken away they'll decry anyone who speaks out against sexual over-promiscuity. Ultimately, my main concern with porn is that it destroys the intimate side of intimacy. It's lies. And if you understand that it's lies then fine, whatever floats your boat. But if you don't know that then it's a problem, and will only create problems.

My only concern with software (and it really is the only concern) is cost. If it's too high people won't buy it. If it's too low devs won't make it. And the other issue is that a lot of parents sadly don't have the time to educate themselves on how to filter content in the home, software or not.

Mit meinen Thesen/Ideen/Hypothesen gehe ich aber noch weiter!

Du sagst:
&gt;Dankbarkeit macht einen jetzt schon zum Komplizen? PRISM ist ein amerikanisches Projekt, bezahlt, entwickelt und betrieben bei amerikanischen Behörden, so ja intern. 

Und ich bin der Meinung, das genau das Gegenteil der Fall sein wird. Nicht heute, nicht in der BILD Zeitung und vielleicht auch nicht morgen - aber danach.
Es wird rauskommen, dass der Grund warum Deutschland sich so extrem hat ausspähen lassen liegt einzig und allein in der massiven Kooperation mit den USA.

Der Dieb Wolfgang Schäuble hätte alles dafür gegeben jeden ausspionieren zu können - Stasi2.0
Der Finanzierungsbetrüber Schäuble hat in seiner Funktion als Innenminister frühzeit das ""potential"" im Kampf gegen ""Links &amp; den Islamismus"" erkannt und war bereit Freiheit zu Ofpern für die Sicherheit der deutschen Hausfrau.
Er erinnert sich nicht mehr, aber hält es heute für richtiger denn je angesichts der großen Gefahr von allen außer der NSU.
Die deutschen Innenminister haben den Aufbau von Schnittstellen mit deutschen Steuergeldern unterstützt und die totale Überwachnung angestrebt. Jeder von denen!

I'm afraid it's the same answer as above. The Americans might have given *themselves* the laws needed to justify spying on foreigners. It's not entirely clear if what they're doing is ""legal"" in the US either.

- The bad thing is that, as those foreigners they're spying on, we have no legal remedy; i.e. we can't sue them, have them extradited for trial or punish them in any way. 

- Democracy and good governance requires accountability and they've taken away part of our sovereignty as states and the right as citizens to impeach our government. Our secret services answer to us ultimately.

Let's note that *foreign* spies are illegal. In my opinion this infringement is tantamount to an attack by a hostile power.

*Communist?!* Well, not strictly speaking - It's an anarchist site after all. But hold on minute. There are news from [Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_of_the_Radical_Left#2012_general_elections), [Czech Republic](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/01/us-czech-communists-idUSBRE9200F220130301), [Cyprus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_of_Working_People#Parliament) among others that the communists are gaining more popularity. What if in the future there will be few euro-communist countries or anarchist countries? Surely, you can't just disregard them based on cold-war era 'common sense'.

----

Now to the issue at hand. Opposed to the article, I find these laws problematic in another way. /u/HELL666's post in this thread and comments [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1ghh6t/poland_does_away_with_the_8hour_day/) show another side of this issue, that is, in Eastern Europe the eight hour work day has been a fiction ever since. Eastern European immigrants to the West get to work without contracts and benefits more hours than the natives. This is really frustrating for both sides and shows Europe-wide problems.

So my fear is, that by making 'flexible' the work hours what will be achieved is exactly a more 'flexible' way to exploit the workers. What now is a standard and fixed (often unregistered) overtime will be a more drastically fluctuating 'flexible' (often unregistered) overtime.

&gt;The government made the labour laws more flexible by extending the work time accounting period from 4 to 12 months ""if justified by objective or technical reasons related to organization of work"". [...] The rationale is that in some industries the amount of work done varies a lot over time. Consider agriculture or construction for good examples.

I tend to be overly skeptical about governments using the term 'objective', since in practice they define those very objective conditions. The rational can vary, the question is what becomes reality.

For instance, in Hungary the 'objective or technical reasons' for *lowering the working hours to four* in some areas were based on the 'rational' that they promised to make more jobs before the election. The result is that twice as many (mostly Romani) people can clean the streets, cut the trees etc. for half the pay, that is 40 000 HUF (~137 €)/month.",0,1371480990,null,0,1371481377,0,cakk14z,t3_1gh5f0,t1_cakk14z,t1_cak8vml,null,1430781336,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Bread goes great with *almost* everything imo. Some things it kind of fails. I agree on the curry (I almost prefer curry with the right bread to with rice) - but say, a roast with a gravy, I'd much rather tatties than bread because the bread will steal my gravy from my meat but the bread/meat/gravy combination isn't nearly as good in a mouthful as with tatties.

&gt;Yea like when you consider England the Celtic thing is the big difference but with Celtic regions such as Scotland and Wales we would be very similar. Obviously there are differences to be found but on the majority it is probably similar enough.

Precisely.

&gt;Saying that though it did sorta raise my heckles...not enough to down vote you because you're not wrong...I just don't like it when people say we're the same...but that was back when I assumed England...no issues being the same as Scotland!

This is just because people assume some sort of cultural imperialism from the statement or something. You saw British and assumed English, something I greatly dislike (not an attack on you, its just a common habit among many which I dislike).

I'm not saying you're culturally homogeneous with Scotland though, but rather with Britain as a whole and I think that continues to be true. Obviously Irish culture is *more* similar to Scottish than to English, but there's a great deal of similarity even between aspects of Irish and English, just as there is with Scots and English. Begin with a nice cup of tea and go from there, ken?

Essentially, I feel almost culturally homogeneous with the English, and I feel almost culturally homogeneous with the Irish.

It's a good city to live in if you have a good network of friends / colleagues, because you might find yourself immersed in lots of activities, but if you don't have people to hang out with it can be very depressing, because, I won't lie, weekends are boring as hell here if you are alone.

In this city there are lots of cultural activities, small concerts, exhibitions, sport-related activities, etc. BUT you must actively look for them, because normally people won't tell you about them if you are not one of their friends / acquaintances, but they'll welcome you if you want to join in. 

I agree that food is expensive, the restaurants tend to serve good quality food,  not as high quality as San Sebastian, but very good.

There's a local culture of drinking, ahem, maybe too much. 

Thursday night is a good moment to have some wines and a little food with friends, it's considered a special night and people go to the old part of the town to enjoy wine and food.

The climate here changes a lot, it's inconsistent and we have a wide range of thermal oscillation, in winter we might have 14F and in summer 100F.

Public transportation is basically by bus, but this is a small city so you can walk or use the bike, more in summer than in winter. 

I don't know wich are the rental prices, I know that a lot of students rent a single room in a flat and they share the flat with other students, so I suppose that renting only one room is not as expensive as renting a full flat.

As for the Opus Dei part, it's true, but if you don't mess with them they won't mess with you, they tend to be very hard working, polite and correct people.

true,Thyrotoxic,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Kind of. Arstechnica did a report on Mega's encryption a while ago and it was the deduplication part that worried them.

""There's another issue besides identity spoofing: Mega's terms of service contain the following puzzler:

    8. Our service may automatically delete a piece of data you upload or give someone else access to where it determines that that data is an exact duplicate of original data already on our service. In that case, you will access that original data.

This sounds a lot like deduplication—only storing each unique chunk of data once to save storage space. The AES-128 encryption used for the node data blocks should ensure that every encrypted block is unique, even encrypted blocks made up of two copies of the same file. If Mega only sees encrypted data, which by definition is all completely unique, how then can they be ""deduplicating"" it? Is something fishy going on?

There is a lengthy discussion at Hacker News on the subject, which has a number of theories, including that Mega is using convergent encryption to identify non-unique blocks, or that the service's CBC-MAC-based integrity checking is used as the basis for deduplication (though this doesn't seem like it would work across accounts, since CBC-MAC uses the user's encryption key, and the same block processed with two different keys would yield two different MACs).

Whatever the underlying method, the fact that block deduplication exists is a blow against the ""see no evil"" approach taken by Mega. By itself, a global method of identifying specific data doesn't necessarily mean anything; however, the implication is that a uniquely identifiable thing can be derived from any given piece of data. This returns some burden to Mega—rather than throw up its hands and say that it has no idea what Mega users Alice or Bob have in their Mega accounts, there apparently is a way of telling whether or not Bob and Alice have the same file or files. If the MPAA gets wind that Bob is hosting a copy of The Hobbit: An Unexpectedly Long Movie in his Mega folder, and Alice also happens to have the same file in her Mega folder, it's trivial to prove that Alice has the same file—in fact, the nature of deduplication means there's some record of every deduplicated block, and therefore every other infringing user.""",0,1371485752,null,0,false,0,caklp2o,t3_1gia4c,t1_caklp2o,t1_caklg1t,null,1430780550,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

* He was the speaker of the business owners association, instead of defending that the government should make easier to start a business he fought to protect current businesses from competition.
* He broke the employee rights, but he was protected by his political connections.
* He didn't care about the efficiency of his business, their business were based in political connections not in having the best products and services.

The wonderful thing about the accession talks is that they are a perfect opportunity to scrutinize Erdogan and his party. You get access and can write what's really going on and Turkey has to agree to it because it's them that want to join. 

No if someone wants to stop the accession talks let it be the Turkish government themselves. That'll clearly say that they don't want to follow or values. Until then just keep hammering the point home that they won't join the club with a democratic track record like theirs even though they are way more prosperous than many Eastern European countries that have joined.

[...] the landmark paper Balaresque et al. was finally published in early 2010 by the Public Library of Science. This argued that the Y-chromosome similarity between most Irish and Basque men related to local population histories, and not to a common Mesolithic hunter-gatherer origin. The true origin is found to have arrived with Neolithic farmers after the Ice Age, and a common mutation from the original happens to have survived most in Irish and Basque males compared to the rest of western Europe. The Basque-Irish genetic similarity therefore arose much later than the programme* suggested, and was the result of genetic drift within each population, not from a prehistoric migration from Iberia to Ireland.

Sorry if I was too harsh. Pamplona is nice for a few years, but it's a very square, formal sort of middle age city. If you're 35 and have a few kids I'm pretty sure it's one of the best cities to live. It's actually ranked first in quality of life  among Spanish cities. If you are there for only a year it won't get to you so bad. The main problem is that if you stay for long enough you start to live an endless routine of nothingness, you go to the exact same bars, see the exact same people, do the exact same activities... because there is nothing more to do.

I remember one of the older guys at our residency telling us the first day ""kids, in Pamplona having a girlfriend is a necessity, otherwise you'll have nothing to do on Sundays""

And don't get me wrong I spent some of my best years there, it's just that we (me and my friends) always felt that another city would have made the experience much better.

When I was there we usually hang out, went to bars, played football or pelota, studied, I went to judo lessons... it's not that you have absolutely nothing to do, it's more that your options are limited and that everything becomes very routine in a short time. That and that the general feel of the city is grey, not bad, not exiting just meh. I guess it's something like suburban america.

You should totally stay there on San Fermin, it's like a a different city, as we used to say ""unless you try to burn something with someone inside everything is permitted in San Fermin"". Also the army effect that you get when you see a few thousand drunks dressed the same way is great.

&gt;Die Weimar, der letzte Dampfer der Städte-Klasse wurde am 10. März 1891 abgeliefert. Ihre Jungfernreise führte sie am 21. Mai nach Baltimore. Am 17. Dezember lief sie erstmals mit dem Zielhafen New York aus. Ihre erste Reise im Einsatz auf der Reichspostdampferlinie begann am 2. Juni 1897 nach Sydney. Sie führte nur zwei nachweisbare Ostasienfahrten durch. Die erste Japanfahrt begann am 7. Februar 1900 von Hamburg nach Yokohama. Darüber führte die Weimar vom 12. Mai bis zum 7. August 1899 den Ablösungstransport für das Kreuzergeschwader durch.

Basically, the part that might be interesting to you is this:

&gt;Ihre Jungfernreise führte sie am 21. Mai nach Baltimore.

translated:

&gt;Her first cruise was on the 21st of May to Baltimore.

But it sounds as if the cruise was in 1891, not 1892. (Might've been 1892 though!) The name is correct though.

Here, the site I have it from:

[Städte-Klasse (Wikipedia)](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A4dte-Klasse)

And even more detailed: [Schiff: Weimar](http://www.schiffe-maxim.de/Weimar.htm)

&gt;und ihre Jungfernreise nach Baltimore startete am 21.Mai 1891 in Bremen.

It was indeed in 1891, not 1892. Precisely the 21st May of 1891, as I said before.

Just what I found when I searched for the ship because that sounded quite interesting to me. I couldn't tell what you were looking for from your post, but now you have all the details about the Weimar! (Okay, sounds as if you were looking for the name of the place they were from... Anyway, the Weimar is probably interesting too, huh?)

I should also add that while Ireland was officially neutral, there was a bias towards the Allied side. For example, German airmen captured in Ireland were interned for the duration of the war, while Allied ones were returned to Northern Ireland. Also the Allies could use Irish airspace and waters around Northern Ireland.

Apart from the case of Irish servicemen in the British army, some controversy surrounding neutrality remains because of the fact that our Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and the President [signed a book of condolences for Hitler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_neutrality_during_World_War_II#Condolences_on_Hitler.27s_death) at the German embassy after he had committed suicide. For them it was a demonstration of Ireland's neutrality, although it's attracted a fair bit of controversy since.

We are, but normally we learn them when we're in primary school. Most of the Irish curriculum in Primary school is either vocabulary grammar, neither of which are in any way interesting to 5 to 12 year old children. 

The Secondary curriculum starts to focus far more heavily on the Irish literature, closer to the English curriculum. Unfortunately, this *does* assume a certain level of fluency, particularly the higher level course. I did my Leaving Certificate 5 years ago, so I'm not sure what it's like now, but at the time so much effort was put into learning off notes for the written papers, which were as comprehensive as the higher level English paper, that no class time was given to the Oral section of the exam until a few weeks before. 

Ideally we would start learning to speak the language fluently, as a form of communication, earlier on. Realistically, no one needs to know how to critique a piece of prose as gaeilge. Far more time should be spent on conversational Irish than written. ",0,1371499946,null,0,false,0,cakr3um,t3_1gi8cx,t1_cakr3um,t1_caki2ds,null,1430777988,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Amongst youngsters, having a good American accent is bad-ass, trying to speak English is not something you're gonna attempt when you have a shitty accent, unless you wanna be uncool and like, looked down upon by society.

With regards to customer service, I think you can notice Americans are always smiling, you can hear it when they talk. The French don't have to do that, their language actually has a good amount of subtlety they can use to show politeness, but it doesn't slide over well in English.

true,Haaveilla,Zespagne,Espagne,"I don't think that not liking small talk makes us less friendly. Personal space and privacy are very important for us. It's considered unpolite to get too close to someone or talk to them for no reason. This is why we shake hands or kiss instead of giving hugs. This is why if you say hello to some random person on the street, he/she will look confused and won't answer. This is why when you enter a shop, and a shop assistant comes to you asking if you need help, you'll say no (and if you actually need help, you'll come back and ask yourself).  
I spent some time in Australia, so I can see what you mean. The thing is that, for me, if a waiter asks how I'm doing, my thought process will be ""why do you care, you don't even know me?! Also, I'm here to eat, not to make friends"".  
It's just a different mindset. It's more difficult to start a conversation, but once you get someone's attention, it will be much more interesting than the small talk you're used to. I actually got used to the small talk in Australia, but in the end it's always the same thing repeated again and again (""it's a hot day today right?"" or ""oh you're French, that's great mate, I love French girls!"").

Là, on voit très clairement que Free a shooté la route du .40 sur son peering à Courbevoie, ou que Google ne la lui a pas annoncé, et que la route est plus longue en passant par TATA (AS6453, un des transits communs de Free et Google, seul le 8ème hop est un routeur appartenant à Tata)


Ce que j'aime bien chez mon FAI (assocatif), c'est qu'on a fabriqué des petits outils sympas pour voir les routes et ce que ça peut donner. Voici le [Looking Glass](http://lg.tetaneutral.net/prefix_bgpmap/gw+h3/ipv4?q=173.194.40.0/24)

Ce qu'on voit là, c'est Google qui découpe les annonces de son /16

    NetRange:       173.194.0.0 - 173.194.255.255

Pour en faire des /24 qui vont être annoncés différemment les uns des autres à leurs peers, qui eux même en feront à peu près ce qu'ils veulent.

Donc, désagrégation du préfixe + réponses DNS différenciées en fonction de la source de la requête, avec les filtrages que les autres opérateurs peuvent appliquer à leurs propres réseaux, ça donne un moyen de contrôler plus ou moins finement non seulement le trafic sortant, mais aussi le trafic entrant.

Dans ce cas précis, on ne sait qui de Google ou Orange a le dernier mot et par quels liens passent réellement les paquets. En effet, Orange ne fourni qu'un [looking-glass très limité](https://lg.opentransit.net/cgi-bin/LG/lg-exec.cgi) (et il faut connaitre les rouages de leur réseau : OTIP = AS5511, RBCI = AS3215). Mais vous avez les grandes lignes des ajustements possibles ;)


2) Un opérateur fait bien ce qu'il veut sur son réseau, tant qu'il est privé. Quand il s'agit d'un ""service de communication électronique ouvert au public"" ([défini par l'article L32 et suivants du code des postes et communications électroniques](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070987&amp;dateTexte=20130617)), alors la loi dit qu'il a une obligation de neutralité, mais ne précise pas de sanction en cas d'infraction à cette neutralité.

En aucun cas par contre un opérateur (au sens IP du terme, donc gouvernement aussi éventuellement) ne peut sciement, et durablement, nuire au routage d'autres réseaux : il se fera depeerer rapidement, et il y aura toujours possibilité de sourcer des liens et tables de routage hors de France.

En clair : pas de great firewall incontournable possible. Il suffit de voir comme les petits opérateurs sont déjà ignorés par certaines lois : on est juste pas assez significatifs pour qu'ils se donnent la peine de nous répondre. 


3) Si tu bloques un range avec un firewall, alors tu vas tdropper (et ça va timeouter), ou bien retourner des ""ICMP Unreachable"", ce qui dans tous les cas n'aboutira pas à trouver un autre chemin. Dans ce cas, c'est peut être le javascript de la page qui va tenter un autre hôte.

Une autre solution srait d'éviter le cache local de ton ISP en utilisant ton propre resolver DNS, ou un resolver public, qui va interroger directement ceux de google.

Ou bien tu vas héberger et regarder des vidéos ailleurs d'ici à ce que tu aies une connexion chez un vrai FAI ;)",0,1371503804,null,0,false,0,caksm2a,t3_1gh2p2,t1_caksm2a,t1_cakfm4o,null,1430777278,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

* The craic is indeed mighty, however as you get older it stops being the most important thing in the world. When that happens, Ireland loses its shine just a huge bit.
* Many places purport to be cities (including my hometown). Dublin is the only sizeable city by any other place's standards. It's also got the highest crime rate AND the most bicycles!
* That scenic green business? That'd be the west coast. Have a look, but don't wait for good weather because if you do that around here, you'll never get anything done.
* No, really, that's how much a pint of beer costs. Yes, we still drink more of it than anyone else (apart from our friends the Czechs, I believe?)
* You've not seen any of our tv shows or movies. Sadly Fr Ted was produced in Britain.

true,th4,null,null,"Questa cosa mi ha incuriosito e sono andato a cercare dei dati sugli incidenti stradali dovuti all'abuso di alcool o droghe. Niente di approfondito, una mezzoretta di letture.

Premetto che secondo me l'incidente lo causa con buona probabilità il guidatore stronzo, quello che sfreccia a 180 facendo a zig zag tra le macchine ad esempio, o che ti si attacca dietro a 20cm etc. Insomma quello che le cazzate le fa perché guida pericolosamente, ubriaco o meno.

Comunque tornando alla ricerca cercando ""percentuale incidenti alcol"" i due articoli che mi sono sembrati più presenti in rete (ovvero ripetuti da più siti e testate) sono:

 [uno](http://motori.corriere.it/attualita/12_novembre_19/incidenti-stradali-nuovi-dati_9cf5cd58-3231-11e2-942f-a1cc3910a89d.shtml) che in pratica dice che l'ISTAT visto che è stato criticato rispetto gli ultimi dati pubblicati, che mostravano una percentuale bassissima di incidenti dovuti all'alcol sul totale, ha deciso di rivedere il proprio modello di rilevazione. Ancora però niente dati.

L'[altro](http://www.repubblica.it/motori/sicurezza/2010/05/25/news/incidenti_stradali_la_met_per_l_alcol-4314575/) è un articolo che cita come fonte uno studio dell'ACI basato su dati del 2008 che secondo i giornalisti conclude che la metà degli incidenti stradali è causato dall'alcol.

Incuriosito mi vado a cercare questo [studio dell'ACI (PDF warning)](http://www.up.aci.it/venezia/IMG/pdf/La_guida_in_stato_di_ebbrezza_nel_contesto_internazionale.pdf) e mi è sembrato che l'unico grafico che parla in termini assoluti sia il primo, che stabilisce in 16.6 incidenti ogni 100000 veicoli il numero di incidenti causati dall'alcol.

Il resto delle tabelle un po' ambiguamente tratta delle percentuali relative a questi incidenti, ovvero quanti di questi sono di notte, quanti con il guidatore uomo etc.

Mi sono allora andato a cercare quale fosse il numero totale di incidenti ogni 100000 veicoli, per capire quale fosse la percentuale di quelli dovuti all'alcol, e [pare che nel 2010](http://roma.corriere.it/roma/notizie/cronaca/12_marzo_14/incidenti-stradali-pedoni-protesta-deleo-2003685534846.shtml) (non ho trovato al volo il 2008 ma penso la flessione sia minima) il numero di incidenti sia 434 ogni 100000 veicoli.

Unica statistica chiara e basata su dati reali che ho trovato è [questa](http://www.segretariatosociale.rai.it/atelier/altriluoghi/incidenti/italia.html) con i dati Postrada del 2002, dove si evince che :

* Dei 120.836 incidenti riscontrati nel 2002, 3.650 sono ascrivibili a causa dovute ad eccesso di alcol e stupefacenti, toccando la percentuale del 3,02%.

* Gli incidenti mortali nel 2002 sono stati 2545, di cui 73 per le cause in oggetto, con una percentuale del 2,86%.

* I sinistri hanno lasciato 2799 vittime, di cui 81 per incidenti causati da alcol e sostanze psicotrope, con una incidenza del 2.89%.

* Gli incidenti con persone ferite sono stati invece 57323 di cui 2251 casi per alcol e consumi di droghe, con una percentuale del 3,92%

* Le persone ferite sono state 93251, quelle per alcol e droga 3662, con un'incidenza del 3,92%

* Per ultimo rimane il dato degli incidenti con danni alle cose, da intendersi, esclusivamente, come danni ai veicoli. I sinistri registrati nel 2002 sono stati 60968, quelli da alcol e sostanze psicotrope, 1326, con un'incidenza dello 2,17%.

The executive order issued by the minority government using a provision reserved for extreme national emergencies that require immediate action (eg war, terrible earthquakes, where it's a matter of 1-2 hours or the country falls into irreversible chaos) remains as is. And since that executive order is not specific about ERT, other public entities will follow.

The public broadcaster will be shutdown, the staff are all fired and the property is now owned by the state and the Ministry of Finance. There will be a new entity formed that will be under the direct control of three ministries (Finance, Culture and Internal Affairs). So much for wanting to make the new broadcaster independent. Now the ties to the state are even stronger.

All the court says is that there should be a public channel on-air until a new state broadcasting entity is formed. Not ERT per se. But using ERT's infrastructure and by hiring new staff on the spot, with 0-hour contracts.

Non-Disclosure Agreements in the UK? Censorship in Germany? 

We should be uniting together against this, not further dividing ourselves. The retarded berth of Anti-Americanism I see is only going to give birth to Anti-Europeism in the states. 

**We are the West**. Sure, Europe can further distance itself from us, but in the long run, it's the wrong decision. The world *is becoming multi-polar*, and with the rise of BRICS, Europe will only continue to go downhill. Allied, our two countries could continue to uphold Western Culture and Standard of Living. We both have our quirks, but fuck, pushing the EU closer to countries like Russia, China, India or Brazil go to show how unmotivated, bare and two-faced your arguments against the United States actually are. By criticizing us for our wrongs, then integrating closer with countries that commit the same wrongs to a greater degree, is hypocritical, if not fucking stupid as shit and shows policy based on *emotion* instead of *logic*. 

I point to the thread the other day, the whole *""I'm starting a political party against the United States"".* Like fucking shit dude, it wasn't even a political movement with an actual goal of **creating something** it was a entire political movement **against something**. Does nobody see how bombastic, childish and reactionary something like that is? How extreme it is? If totalitarianism starts with anything, it starts with *that*. 

I don't know. Keep pushing away from us. Keep telling us how different our countries are, how evil we are, absolving your own politicians from blame *(as they want you too)* and only blaming us for the decisions of your *own* elected representatives who chose, cooperated and BENEFITED from this. It's what they want. 

Or you know, we could unite, further integrate, and use our combined weight of the people from both countries to actually force change on our leaders. To ensure something like this never happens again and that western values, and privacy are upheld on both sides of the Atlantic.

true,Ginjeet,ANAR,☭,"Capitalism's systemic contradictions create crises. Crises for the middle and lower classes, to be more precise - the class system is inherent to capitalism - the bourgeois class already lives in their own form of socialism. Saying that it prevents famine, in the years when our fellow Greeks, Spaniards etc. are hit so hard by austerity that hundred-thousands are in despair, hunger and joblessness is silly. Saying it while we in the West rely on the third world's slavish working conditions, while there are millions every year who die from hunger under capitalist economies is just cruel. Not to mention the obvious fact, that capitalism doesn't allocate resources rationally, nor equally or humanely: 30-50% of food produced never reaches a human stomach here; we propagate private transportation (vs public) to boost car production and loose our main source of energy, oil.

&gt;Slavery was started in a pre-capitalist environment and I don't think it could take wide hold in a capitalist society otherwise.

Marx's idea was that slavery-feudalism-capitalism share a common source: the exploitation of the individual. You at your workplace are still being exploited, even if you allow yourself to be hired, you still get only a portion of your work's worth, to put it very bluntly. Even the founding fathers of the US (Marx was a fan of Lincoln) were against this.

I saw your reply and thought 'this again'... I know you have good intentions, but you basically reiterate the same goddamn propaganda cliches showed down people's throat since the cold war.

A little trivia time.

For those that don't know, saudade is the feeling of missing someone/something. English doesn't really have a word for it.  (Also, see [Desenrrascanço](http://www.cracked.com/article_17251_the-10-coolest-foreign-words-english-language-needs_p2.html))

Legend has it that during the ""Discoveries"", when we navigated the world, people at home would long for the loved ones that went away in search of a new world -- this was such a prevalent feeling among us, that a new word eventually arised to describe it.

Eventually, the word began to mean the ""heartache"" you feel when you miss something. We as culture have saudades over EVERYTHING.
