This, in turn, leads to a very poor sense of the state and of the civic duty. Whatever you do, someone will take advantage of it, so you should take advantage of the state first. And this leads to thinking that all politicians are thieves and it is almost your duty to stick it to them.

Genau das ist ja das Problem bei den Immo-Blasen. Die Leute die nach Berlin flüchten sind ja so vermögend, dass sie sich Wohnungen als *Spekulationsobjekt* leisten können. Und der deutsche Immomarkt eignet sich aufgrund des starken Mieterschutzes nicht wirklich als Spekulationsobjekt, daher bietet er nur geringe Rendite. Aber eine geringe Rendite in DE ist immer noch besser als eine negative Rendite in Barcelona, daher momentan der Ansturm auf DE. Gerade für längerfristige Investitionen eignet sich daher der deutsche Immo-Markt recht gut. 


Bilanztechnisch hat man in deinem Beispiel ein Haus mit einem Anschaffungswert von 300.000€ mit einem Marktwert von 50.000€. Die 250.000€ Differenz sind dann als Verlust zu verbuchen.

	Exponentielle et non sélective (n'importe qui peut proposer des idées)

	-&gt; on ne peut plus trier l'info
2. biais de confirmation

	Pas de bouton ""j'aime pas""

	Tendance à fréquenter des univers qui confirment notre point de vue au lieu de chercher des informations contradictoires

	-&gt; probabilité de trouver des informations confirmant notre point de vue élevée

	ex : si je veux trouver des infos prouvant l'astrologie, je vais en trouver facilement
3. surexposition des théories du doute et des croyances par rapport aux connaissances

	Les croyants sont plus motivés que les non-croyants

	Il est plus facile de prouver que quelque chose existe que de prouver qu'il n'existe pas

	-&gt; Les indécis vont avoir tendance à être persuadés par les croyances.

	ex : je ne sais pas si l'astrologie est vraie, je cherche sur google, et je vois beaucoup plus de sites qui disent que c'est vrai
4. mutualisation des arguments de la croyance (il est plus facile de prouver que quelque chose existe que de prouver que quelque chose n'existe pas)

	défiance vis-à-vis de la science (les théories scientifiques ne sont que des théories, elles sont souvent revues et corrigées

	intimidation argumentative face à la multiplication des arguments
	
	\-&gt; *tout ne peut pas être faux*

	ex : dans la théorie du complot du 11 septembre, il y a tellement  d'arguments (financiers, sismiques, chimiques ...) qu'une seule personne ne peut tous les réfuter

5. Phénomène d'oubli des infirmations et de concurrence médiatique

	impact du pagerank sur la diffusion par les médias ""traditionnels""
	prime au scoop

	rémanence de l'information, on ne laisse plus le temps à la science de démentir les nouvelles théories

	-&gt; être le premier à diffuser l'info pour faire des clics, même si elle n'est pas vérifiée
6. Démagogie cognitive et populisme

That's part of it. In my time in Italy and with Italians I see 3 main arguments that are actually used to rationalize voting for Berlusconi:

1. He's rich and therefore must understand how to run businesses and by extension an economy. All the scandals against him are people jealous of his success. A successful businessman is a good steward for the economy.

2. He is an example a of a virile and successful Italian male. All the sex scandals against him are started either by people jealous of his success, or jilted women who he rejected.

3. Old people watch TV, and TV in Italy is terrible. Only one channel could even be described as mildly anti-Berlusconi. Their opinion is the above 2 combined, plus an added element of ""everything had been going fine while Berlusconi was in power"" so why bother to replace him? They also easily buy in to his immigrants are the problem line. There are shitloads of old people in Italy, and they vote disproportionately.

Those are the main 3 reasons people vote for him, but they aren't the only reasons for his success. There is also blatant bribery, alleged links to the mafia, and also blatant nepotistic lawmaking (for example making a law that over 75s can't go to jail because his lawyer was convicted for bribing a court official - while making the defence that Berlusconi is so rich he couldn't have noticed the bribe money being missing and was innocent. Funnily enough, this same law could also protect Berlusconi from jail time in his current case.).

Two reasons. First, changing the constitution is a huge pain the neck: you need a huge majority in both houses and you need to vote for it four times total (and often there's a referendum after all that). Since huge agreements among political parties like the ones necessary to go through a constitutional reform are beyond rare, this is something that appens very little (the only time constitution was effectively changed was back in 2001 about regional autonomies, and accomplishing that was long and painful). Second, it is something which could backfire very badly. Think about the Nato scenario: after a long and difficult negotiation with the americans, Italy joins Nato (which at the time was the most vital of objectives) only to have it thrown to the gutter because of a referendum fueled by communist (and catholic as well) propaganda about imperialism and big bad evil americans.

So, why not remove the taxes/budget, but let people vote about Nato/EU/Euro?  Second, that might be a difference between Sweden/Italy, but here you can actually win an election with higher taxes, or not loose (like the last one) by saying that you will not lower them until the finances allows it. To me, the Italians do not make financial sense at all when they vote - Italy is being held up by the ECB, need massive changes and the votes go to Grillo and Berlusconi. 

Second - Are you honestly saying that in a democracy, the people shouldn't be able to decide whether they want to join a military organization or not? Or change the currency, and the future of Italy forever with the Euro? Don't you think people have a right to decide about their future? Nato may force you into war, yet people should have no say?

And this leads to thinking that all politicians are thieves and it is almost your duty to stick it to them.

But now you are sticking it to the Eurozone? The only reason the Italian interest rate isn't going through the roof is that the ECB is buying Italian bonds. And, Italy is not even willing to elect someone who is prepared to do the deep structural changes that needs to be done.  So, the Italian poor sense of state has now crossed the border to other countries. Who in the end do the Italians think is paying for those bonds? Who stands as a guarantee?

But it really makes sense, also in light of the very high consumption of TV - without having the figures i believe that Italy ranks among the nations who watches the most daily hours of TV per capita.

It also is no wonder that Grillo has focused on promoting his movement via the Internet. And although people call him a clown I think that Italians can at least be proud of his ability to circumvent Berlusconi's stranglehold on the Italian media. Certainly us redditors must see something positive from that shift, and i doubt the German Pirate Party would be any less in shambles if they suddenly found themselves with the nationwide backing Grillo has.

O really? Where I live, nobody knows my degree. Especially not the Bäckereifachverkäuferin. 

&gt; An opposition party in Parliament, the Greens, introduced a bill in December 2011 to remove the academic title from passports and national identification cards, which would have effectively demoted the title from its high perch. The bill was not adopted in a Parliament in which about 18 percent of members hold the title of doctor or professor.

- The Dr. in a passport is optional, you are not forced to add it. 
- I have never ever shown someone my passport when I want to impress them. I use my business cards fort that, so the proposed law wouldn't change a thing. They also have to regulate business cards, letterheads and door plates. 
- And of course those regulations will also apply to Bachelor/Master/Diplom/Magister and Meister/Techniker/Betriebswirt and Facharbeiter etc. pp. I don't want to see a single Autohaus bragging with it's Meisterwerkstatt any longer ...

Historically speaking, joining Nato no matter what was the only sane thing to do. Italy signing in was the last seal on the whole process of siding with americans (which begun with the end of the war and went trough the crucial elections of '48 when we choose Washington over Moscow) and the material advantages in terms of sheer wealth for the italian people which were at stake were the only thing to pursue. The americans were willing to pay a high price in order to be able to list us in the list of friends, and putting them in the condition for paying that price was the very least we could do (keep also in mind that even the communist politicians writing the constitution were perfectly aware of that and, while not being able to openly admit it for obvious reasons, were totally ok with shielding the Nato treaty from the referendum).

Thus said (and also reminded that it's not that Nato snaps its fingers and we are off bombing people in the desert: everything involving our military goes through the parliament and it is far from contemplating any form of automatism) we have  to consider the whole subject of international treaties, which is broader than Nato. In today's world, international treaty means - and this is a trend likely to increase - financial, monetary and economic bindings among states. Is it right for the people to have little say about that? I'd really love to answer no, yet I am a little puzzled. Were Italy to held a referendum about euro next month, those voting to step out would likely be the majority: we'd spend a cheerful night yelling take that, you lousy bankers only to wake up the morning after hangover and with that little debt problem which just went full-screwing. I know you lucky swedes are doing fine with your precious krowns, but if there's anything Sweden and Italy sadly can't be compared is the issue we are talking about.

Yes, you can, if it's made on a religious basis. If you have an artistic project where you want to involve the public and you have them separate, you announce that prior to the event and if anyone doesn't respect that, you just go along. The same applies to skin colour; it would be daring, but not illegal, to ask the crowd to observe some form of segregation if it's a component of an artistic performance. Asking them for segregation just because they don't have the same colour would simply account as a form of inequality.

I am not saying that this should be *forbidden* -- I am well-aware that there are people for whom this has been the norm for generations, and they would actually feel uncomfortable without it. So just provide a section in the crowd for people who *want* this: if there were ""women"", ""men"" and ""couples"" sections, there was definitely room for a ""don't care"" section. This way, people who are comfortable within their cultural framework can still be comfortable without making everyone else uncomfortable.

Same goes with toilets -- unisex toilets are common in small bars, where there just isn't enough room. In a place with several restrooms, going to the one of the opposite gender is, at most, somewhat frowned upon and met with disaproving glances, but it's merely an issue of convenience, not a continuation of a culture where breaking segregation often results in severe punishment.

As far as I understand it, there are alternatives to some tests but to replace the current methods a lot of development is still needed (a lot of the methods are expected by 2017). I don't really understand what the current alternatives are (one example being physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) modelling - ?) but personally I don't think it's a big problem if research in the cosmetical industry (this law only applies to cosmetics!) is somewhat limited for the following five years so we can have higher ethical standards.

About his comment, that language influences the expression of ideas. E.g. *austerity* is used in English and even more in French - but only few German would understand *Austerität*. Newspapers are writing about ""reducing the state deficit"", which is much more positive. French articles tent to be more negative and create a different context for this certain word (or the context existed before? Not sure about that)

A different language enforces different vocabulary. After becoming fluent, you are usually formulate your ideas directly in the target language. It costs more time and effort to persuade someone without having words, that are socially connected to e.g. a feeling of injustice. Another example: The Inuit have 20 different words for snow, and I imagine it difficult to translate an instruction to build a snow shelters to any other language.

The idea was for us to research other means of testing pharma products, rather than cosmetics, but ultimately it was all the same push by the EU to get rid of all animal testing in the EU. And not just skip it, but to improve testing. For example a major area of research was to test drugs directly on human embryonic stem cells, and derived cell lines, in order to see actual effects on human cells. 

There are a bunch of serious complications about how well *in vitro* testing works compared to *in vivo*, but there were many many research groups around Europe working on this. 

It's early days still for pharma, but for topical cosmetics I think they should have stopped animal testing decades ago. The dangers are minimal, most of these cosmetics are made from very bland ingredients we already know a lot about. 

And one last thing, fuck all the people complaining about this change. The EU are funding cutting edge research that is both ethically important, medically important and also with the potential to bring a lot of high tech jobs to Europe in the future.

I. Either start spending your money

This would be sound advice if 'we' as in the German people had any money to spend. But all the gains in income and wealth in the last 10 years or even longer back went to those who were already in the top 10%. The €150bn surpluses we post year on year don't actually reach the vast majority of German society. They are either kept in the hands of employers through low wage increases for the sake of competitiveness (and the reason why the FPIIGS are not competitive is because we are), with generous support from the labor unions, or they are kept in the tax coffers to make a laissez faire fiscal policy look ingenious because we're reducing our deficit at a fairly comfortable pace by doing absolutely nothing, neither touching spending nor income: The revenue just rises on its own.
Three million people are unemployed officially, but some claim the number is airbrushed and that it's really two thirds higher, at up to five million. Of those who are employed, every fourth works in the low wage sector. The bottom 30% of Germany either have zero wealth or are actually net debtors. Those are not big spenders, those are the people for whose benefit horse meat found its way into European convenience food. If you're eating it, it's for you.

II. let the ECB make enough money available

'We' would rather let you die. This is not my personal opinion, rather a statement on the political mainstream in Germany. 60% of Germans are afraid that the Euro crisis will cause inflation (which betrays not only a complete lack of economic understanding, but more importantly, the kind of fear that you can smell). Merkel's junior partners, the Free Democrats, are so gung-ho about the Euro being a sound currency that they want to put a pledge to keep it that way in the constitution, like the limits on deficits. We can make laissez faire fiscal policy look ingenious, so why not try it with monetary policy, too.

? You are supposed to, and have been since 1999 to have a budget in accordance with the EU budgetary rules. You have not, nor are you obeying them though. For example, you shouldn't have a debt of more than 60 % of GDP. Are you saying, that Italy, unlike all the other countries in the Eurozone are not obliged, by the treaty they have signed, to follow it? 

And yes, are you not aware of the fact that the ECB has gone out and defended the Italian interest rate? I think the commentator (on BBC, it was over 6 months ago) used the word - limitless. The reason they did this is that Italy is to big to bail out, and to big to fall. So yes, if the ECB didn't defend the Italian interest rate, it would be where it was going to before - up. A lot.

Even the _need_ for this is just speculation. So far, Italy has paid for Greece's debt even though Italian banks had virtually no Greek debt, unlike for example German banks. Italy has always been, and still is, a net payer to the EU.

&gt;For example, you shouldn't have a debt of more than 60 % of GDP.

&gt;Yes, and except during Berlusconi's governments 

So, apart from the last 20 years, you have tried hard? For how long have Berlusconi been in power really? Honestly, to me it seems like Italy hasn't tried at all then.

&gt; Also, it has a very large public debt but a very small private debt.

Doesn't matter, it says 60 %. And, you can see a huge rise in that if the ECB decided that they didn't want to back you up any more. 

&gt;Never with money. Just promising to do that was enough to put speculation to rest.

So, they didn't buy the bonds that the article said they bought? 

&gt;Even the need for this is just speculation. 

So, let them quit then. Honestly, Italy can't put its head in the sand anymore, which sounds like you want to do. Yes, you have been a net payer, but you have done nothing, at all, to fix the corruption, the bribes, the tax evasion and above all, the structural reforms you need so badly in the last 20 years. If the ECB were not propping Italy up, the interest rates would go through the roof. 


&gt;Italy has always been, and still is, a net payer to the EU.

The Eurozone and the EU are two different things. 27 countries in the EU, 14 (soon to be 15 in the EZ).  That does not in any way help the tax payers from Finland/Germany/the Netherlands who are now shouldering the risk for the Italians. You have an artificially low risk, due to the fact that the tax payers in other countries guarantee that the investors will get their money back. And, instead then of voting for someone who can reform the system, Italy choose to vote fo a) a clown b) someone who is corrupt and has decidedly not reformed the system before.

Of course nobody will ever sue the contractors for this.

I believe having cats is a requirement if we want to put Rafales on board so that gets in the way of co-operation here. In fact there is a conspiracy theory that BAE intentionally gimped the contract so the UK military wouldn't dump the Eurofighter. If we run F/A 18s or Rafales for the navy it starts to look very grim for the Typhoon. The RAF will surely want to take advantage of the efficiencies involved in running the same equipment chain as the navy. BAE really doesn't want to hand a bunch of business to Dassault.

I suspect increasingly you'll see Britain and France will be closer on future military R&amp;D projects. If the strategic picture changes then the business picture will have to adapt to suit.

&gt;How can you hope to cover all the various topics by yourself? There is a reason that teachers focus on 2-3 subjects. Looking up things in books might work, but that has to get old, if you have to do it for every single question.

The same way I need to find information myself, google. I don't have to do it for every single question, as we, as do you have a large level of knowledge ourselves. 

At some age our children will graduate to a school. I'm not sure when that will be.

Oddly enough, we do actually have advanced training and equipment donated by friends from Universities, but that's certainly not the bulk of what is required, just interesting you brought that up, and I'm sitting quite near it.

&gt;Is there always a parent at home, or do you have many children? I figured that I would feel somewhat lonely, if I hadn't gone to school in the mornings.

I work from home, my wife does the full time teaching. She is always there. Today they are at a Science Academy near our home with some friends of theirs who are out of school this week (spring break maybe?). 

EDIT: 

I should also add, it's not entirely teaching all the time. What really happens is they decide on something interesting to do, and work out how to do it. It's less teaching and more experiencing the work together, and learning from the experience as it goes forward.

The last project was a stop motion film. It turned out great. They didn't know how to do it, but went through the experience. Now they know significantly more about it than I do, and can teach me in a coming weeks as I have time. 

Student or teacher? Who knows. Designations aren't always so important.

Again, this is the life we have chosen to live. I think if you saw it, you wouldn't be particularly against it. The most common thing we hear is, ""That's interesting and cool, I could never do it.""

Our response, You could, you would just have to go through the process of learning and experience it. Improving on it, just like anything else you do.

Poi, discutibilissimo presupposto^1: i campioni presi in esami sono rappresentativi della popolazione es.: il 29% degli intervistati sono pensionati, così come il 29% della popolazione sono pensionati.

I'm sure you know almost all politicians (maybe not on the far left) have luxury accessories ""worth"" tens of thousands of euros. He just was not as good as them at hiding it.

I'm not saying he's a celebrity, but is every good looking woman a trophy wife ? In a way, I guess they are, but this goes way beyond our topic. The question is : does it compare with multiple orgies with barely legal teens ?


*Civilians in the police* : first of all, a militia is armed. Civilian police servants (they mostly write tickets or ask you to please stop whatever it is that you're doing and wait while they call the real police)  are not. This system is used in many countries (USA, UK, Germany, NL off the top of my head). You don't need a police officer to write tickets all day while he could use his specific skills elsewhere.

The rest are not facts, they're what you perceive. ""Diverting of public money"", ""sabotage of justice"" these are not accusations, they are allegations. Seems like you just hate the guy (I can understand that) but really saying Sarkozy and Berlusconi are clones is over the top.

About how to actually get there, it's now too late because there are too many different states in Europe, with different foreign policies..etc... (if we had stayed with the founders and first few other countries that joined the CEE/EU, we'd probably be already much closer to a federation by now..) You can't suddenly say to 20+ states to become part of a federation all at the same time, and we can't do this progressively, because that would take decades and decades of little tweeks in laws here and there, and people will dislike it... What we should strive for is creating a federal state inside the EU. Say for example (and that's just to demonstrate) France and the UK decide to unite into a federal state. The new state is still part of the EU, along with other independent members, but now it's a sub-union, below the EU, but considered one state part of the EU. A couple years later, the Netherlands want to join that new Federal state and they do. And that federal state stays a member of the EU..etc.. until most or all EU members join that regime, and if most of them join, we scrap the EU, and with the last members who still didn't join we keep and still update treaties with them so they can still enjoy free-trade agreements they previously had with us when under the EU and all.. The goal is of course that everyone joins, but we can only do that if we still guarantee a relative autonomy, like many regions enjoy in sovereign nations around the world.

Everyone did. It was the up years. Hard to fail those years.

&gt;The reason why the euro is a good thing for Italy, is because we cannot anymore believe that we can go from one devaluation to the next.

I can understand that, but it is only good if you use the breathing space to reforms, and positive changes. Instead of actually reforming, dealing with the tax evasion, corruption and structural reforms. All Italy is doing now is instead of devaluating, you are letting other countries tax payers shoulder the burden/risk. The Italians are still not trying to fix Italy. The guy that tried get voted away.

What do you think will happen when other countries tax payers get tired, not just of shouldering your risk (because that is what an interest is, a risk. That is why it costs more money for Uganda to borrow money than for Finland - bigger risk of not getting them back from Uganda), in particular when the Italian voters have made it abundantly clear that they are not even remotely interested in fixing what is wrong. Why are Italians so hell bent on not fixing stuff, or why don't the Italians realise that they are being propped up by other countries. They are shouldering you, and in return you vote for Berlusconi - again. And a clown. When are Italy going to start to actually change? 


The fact is, that interest rate is a risk. The one who lends the money is taking a risk. That is also why want more money lending money to Uganda, than to Finland.

I think the biggest problem with the EU is that it's very hard to contain it to one thing.

If it was ""just trade"", it would be fine, I'm sure, but you can't trade until you agree what the things you trade are - and if the definition of ""Surgical steel"" varies between countries, you can't trade it, until you redefine ""Surgical steel"".

Sometimes this is good, sometimes this is bad.

If you make a comparison between 1990 and 2006, for how many suffered nickel allergy, [it's obvious that the numbers have dropped drastically](http://www.videncenterforallergi.dk/userfiles/images/Billeder%20-%20faste%20sider/grafer/nikkel_foer_efter_fuld_str.jpg), thanks to common EU laws for how much nickel can be in things that come into contact with the body.

And then there's the horsemeat scandal, of course.

But the biggest problem is the bureaucrats and politicians. I don't know if they're stupid or wilfully ignorant, but it is becoming very clear, that You can't just have an isolated thing, like ""trade"", and expect it not to impact other aspects of the member countries - like with the Nickel allergies.

Yet, politicians and bureaucrats started the Euro-project - a shared currency, and didn't expect that we'd need an independent, autonomous international bank (because it's not a national bank, any longer), and that of course it would be necessary to redistribute the money, so it wouldn't bunch up in one country. Then the crisis happened, and everybody is shocked and alarmed!

I would not mind shared currency, and one European master-bank - nor would I mind that it's Bruxellian politicians who set the fiscal vision.

But I would mind if it's going to be the same people who've been fighting at the dinner table, and are presently sitting with sauce on their pants, telling me everything is allright, and they've got the matter well in hand.

However, if your kid is a student at a Gymnasium,  they will get a broader and deeper understanding of most academic subjects than in most other countries*.

Google ""Hervé Eon"" (the guy who was prosecuted for quoting Sarkozy's ""casse toi pauv' con"" during a protest), ""Sarkozy off France 3"" or ""Sarkozy Vodoo doll"" to see what I am talking about.

*Fascination for money* : I am talking about his declarations ""décomplexées"" about the fact that he loves making money and that it will be what he does after his mandate.

*Trophy wife*: Note that I have nothing against this, I am just noting that this is the first president of the 5th republic to do so. This does not compare to orgies, and I agree that on this point they probably differ.

*Civilians in the police* : weapons are not the main danger, the immunity and legitimacy is. You may never have felt threatened by them, but I can tell you that queuing the prefecture with my foreign wife in order to get a visa, I felt quite threatened by people who were clearly skinheads alongside regular police. If they start a fight, law will be on their side.

*Diverting of public money* : the justice is on his tail for several affairs, but Lagarde implied she received orders in the shameful Tapie affair. I also find it very hard to believe that there was no conflict in interest when Sarkozy's brother manages one of the biggest private retirement fund in France (Malakoff Mederic) while the president Sarkozy pushes the age of retirement. The fact the Woerth couple seemed to cause no concern to Sarkozy despite being the exact definition of a conflict of interest is also very saying.

*Sabotage of justice* : you have to admit that strikes of judges is a fairly rare event in France. Tribunals are not known as a leftist bastion (well, maybe now they are) 

Please tell me if you really want to go into the discussion about the economic results. This is a long discussion and would enjoy to learn how someone apparently literate about the events can really support Sarkozy, but I would totally understand a lack of time or desire for you to do so.

Ma la sovrintendenza ha comunque rifiutato la concessione di scavo.

Da quello che si dice qui in dipartimento è perché in realtà in caso di ritrovamento il proprietario può comunque reclamare il premio anche se ha firmato un pezzo di carta, e quindi piuttosto che rendere vincolante la rinuncia, al ministero hanno pensato bene di risolvere il problema rinunciando direttamente a far scavare in terreno di privati.",0,1363030604,null,0,false,0,c8trc19,t3_1a3bck,t1_c8trc19,t1_c8tr77f,null,1431552686,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

This means that the Greek financial situation is significantly worse than the rest of Europe. Nobody doing particularly well at the moment, but Greece is doing significantly worse.

Of course what all the reasons you mention explain why Europe is in such a deep financial crisis at the moment. However, as I stated above, Greece's financial crisis is significantly worse. The question then beckons, why did this crisis hit Greece more so than any other European country? The reason of course being the improper way the Greek government acted prior to 2007 (such as drastically overspending) and, as another example, the endemic tax evasion that plagued the country.

&gt;Greece's incompetence.

Depends how you want to define incompetence. Was the Greek government incompetent in the years preceding 2007. Yes, overwhelmingly. Were the Greek population that paid their taxes incompetent? Not at all. I have the greatest sympathy for these people. They've worked hard, paid their way, and been royally fucked over by the establishment and their non-tax paying compatriots. Thirdly, were the Greek non-tax paying population incompetent? Yes they were. Tax evasion is a crime for good reasons.

True, but -15% is not a bad feat, especially starting from really bad deficit/GDP rates.

&gt; Italian voters have made it abundantly clear that they are not even remotely interested in fixing what is wrong.

They are kind of interested. Berlusconi lost almost half of the votes (numerically; a bit less in percentages), and votes for Grillo are not for his agenda but just from the perception that everyone is the same among the politicians and everything should change. No one thought that he was going to be necessary for any kind of majority and now that he is, the bomb is exploding in his hands. The problem is what happens before the bomb is either defused or explodes, i.e. how we form a government.

Certainly most of the left-wing voters very much see a government with Grillo as a lesser evil compared to one with Berlusconi. The unknown-unreliable compared to the known-unreliable.

Are they?  If we have absolutely zero problems renewing our debt, it's because investors actually believe that the risk connected to our debt is in practice lower than what the interest rates say.

true,TubePanic,europe,,"Vero. Non capisco perche' Unabomber continui a essere citato anche se - a ben guardare - tutti i suoi scritti sono un cumulo di metafore fasulle e fuorvianti.

Per esempio, qui non si considerano un paio di cose:

1- L'Automobile non e' una invenzione 'approvata' da una cabala di cattivissimi scenziati; e' un'idea 'ombrello' sviluppata nel tempo, che raggruppa oggetti molto diversi fra loro - a partire di primi tentativi di motore a scoppio fino alle Tesla ibride, passando per le F1 e i diesel. Non si sarebbe potuto - mai - 'decidere di non introdurla'; non piu' di quanto si sarebbe potuto decidere di non introdurre l'elettricita'..  

2- Ogni volta che saliamo in auto o scendiamo in strada, c'e' il rischio di avere un incidente.  Il calcolo che ognuno di noi implicitamente fa e' che il rischio e' minuscolo rispetto ai benefici; altrimenti nessuno andrebbe in auto. Questa' e' una decisione distribuita che ognuno di noi fa, non una caratteristica dell'automobile in quanto 'invenzione malefica'.

3- Nessuno considera quante vite vengono salvate -ogni giorno - dal motore a scoppio. Basta pensare all'enorme produttivita' che senza di esso sarebbe impossibile, alle carestie dovure all'assenza di macchine agricole, ecc.

Unabomber dovrebbe essere consegnato all'Oblio eterno. 

Ma i cattivi maestri ce ne mettono per morire.

Also the BBC have received a bit of a backlash over their misquoting various EU Figures in regards to the Scottish Independence debate; three in a row. Latvia, Luxembourg and Ireland, to quote myself from a previous thread: 

Luxembourg: Last Tuesday, the BBC said in a story that Luxembourg was the first EU country to come out against Scottish independence. The quote in question being ""As we are all facing serious economic and social challenges, this is a time for solidarity between member states of the EU and within member states, rather than for going separate ways."" from their Foreign Minister. However a Spokesperson for the Foreign Minister said he was talking about all Member states, and that his comment in particular was aimed at the UK's seeming Anti-EU stance.

Ireland: A European Minister of Ireland, Lucinda Creighton, was quoted to have said that ""Scotland faced ""complex"" and lengthy negotiations to join the EU."", Mrs Creighton later said her comment had been ""Misconstrued"" by the BBC.

Latvia: This one is the simplest. The BBC simply chose to completely ignore the comment by the Latvian Foreign minister, who challenged the view that the UK would automatically gain the EU membership if Scotland and the rUK separated. They didn't report on it in the slightest, whilst taking the time to report the other comment he made about Scotland having to reapply to the EU.

Perhaps that sounds a little harsh on Greece in that there are other important sources of the crisis (sub-prime mortgages etc.). But, in the context of the Eurozone crisis, I fail to see how you can argue Greece isn't responsible for why Greece is in such a bad position. Much like the UK is responsible for its situation, France for its, Germany for its, and so on.

Anyway, the question of are these reforms in the right direction. Given the incredible amount of overspending the Greek government engaged in, serious cost cutting is absolutely necessary. That does suck, and the people do feel it (much like anywhere else where cost-cutting policies are used). The bureaucracy there was one example. It was vastly overstaffed and under efficient. Beyond that austerity is of course divisive. Germany believes in it. The IMF does not. I'd agree that austerity needs some rethinking at this point.

&gt; Greece has finally started implementing reforms

Yes this is a wholly positive development. Greece has laboured against these reforms, tough though they maybe. That inaction only served to worsen their situation. Contrast with Latvia, who went hard and fast on reform, and implemented it at all levels. They had some rubbish times, but are recovering brilliantly. Greece has been the opposite of this.

It's sort of like saying there should be world peace because countries shouldn't invade each other. While this is technically true, it isn't at all realistic. If you go to school, you'll likely be bullied to some degree at some point. This allows you to develop means for taking care of the situation. You can go to a teacher, fight back, tell your parents, try talking it out, etc. etc. By experiencing those situations you develop the proper tools for handling similar situations as an adult. Please note that I'm not saying we should make schools into miniature thunder domes where children are bullying each other and the strong survive; we of course should do everything we can to combat it. but giving children social experience (including in bullying situations) can benefit them when they are adults.

A lot of the things recently passed (the ones regarding internet privacy, animal testing, fishing, pesticides, etc) seem quite good (remember the porn thing wasn't actual legislation, and I'm not sure if it even passed). 

Europe could probably be turned federal without sacrificing democraticness, if the undemocratic parts (mainly the commission) were required to answer to the EU parliament. (Similar to the minister-parliament relation a lot of the members states have going.) And it, the parliament, gets the power to actually propose legislation.

As far as I understand the American interpretation it's seen as the parents' right to raise their child as they see fit as long as they're not being abusive and subsequently homeschooling is legal.
 
The German perspective has generally been a different one, and that is that it's the child's right to get a balanced education, and that the parents' influence in what that should entail needs to be limited for the sake of children whose parents would not do a good job (e.g. teach opinion as fact, lock their kids away and prevent them from learning how to be social amongst their own peers, reaching personal limits when it comes to teaching a second and third language, etc - the Romeikes from the article are the precise reason why homeschooling is not legal in Germany, the position is that why these parents can obviously teach their children whatever they see fit, it's the right of the children to be exposed to different lines of thinking as well).
 
The two opposing poles here are safety versus freedom (something that continues up into higher education where the US approach seems to be to offer the best possible education in the world by allowing increased prices that limit access to this high quality education significantly, while the German approach is to offer good higher learning instituations that are accesible for almost everybody). If you prioritise freedom you will likely prefer the American model as it gives the parents more choice, while someone who prioritises safety would prefer the German model as it ensures that fewer children get an inadequate education. On an individual level I think the American system is very often preferable, as someone who is very educated (or at least very smart an willing to learn), open minded, and willing to ensure their children have an active social life might possibly make up for a lack in formal education by being able to focus on a single or a small group of students which might quite possibly result in an equally good or even better learning experiences than some schools can offer. From a societal point of view I don't think that protecting the freedoms of these parents is worth neglecting the needs of the children with less capable parents, and as one cannot properly vet parents on all the subjects they plan to homeschool on before they're already on the job it's impossible to prevent that while still allowing homeschooling for others.",0,1363043739,null,0,false,0,c8tvory,t3_1a2xqr,t1_c8tvory,t1_c8tnhrb,null,1431554786,14,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,14

Is that really worth it?

The problem with a federalised EU is that it would be more like a country of ""Germany, France &amp; Co"" - they dominate the European Project and both it's theoretical and actual practicality to the nth degree. That may be something smaller or newer nations would be willing to accept in service of gaining the benefits but that's an infinitely harder sell to large, old ones like the UK, Holland or Finland.

For example, you have the policies going through right now that are essentially (whether purposefully or otherwise) targeted towards the City of London and the UK's massive and crucial financial sector, yet France won't even discuss altering the CAP. It's this sort of insanely disproportionate, unfair thinking that makes me believe that France &amp; Germany will never be willing to give up enough of their control and interests to take the more sceptical members with them. Oh yeah and the Euro.

On the European Army proposal I consider it both unnecessary and unworkable, we have done enough already to ensure we won't repeat our history and quite frankly, a lot of European states won't even honour their commitments to defence pacts like NATO right now. How are you gonna convince the anti-interventionist, anti-war populations and politicians to spend lives and treasure when required? Not to mention the nightmare presented by language and procedural barriers, I much favour a series of bi-lateral agreements - such as the great one the UK is developing with France - then letting NATO and the UN take care of the larger picture.

So what you'd be left with is a smaller (because I can guarantee at least the UK would leave the EU, with others probably following suit, if you ever tried this), weaker, poorer, less democratic and I'd argue even more internally conflicted entity than what we have *right this second*. And for what? To share a flag?

I just don't see a scenario where the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, where the ends justify the means, and on that basis I'd say I'm not in favour of it.

I really, really don't know about this. I think France is showing a brave face, but is more like a man riding a lion. In many ways the US has more influence with your average EU member (think very internationalist Nordics and Eastern Europe) than France. Language is leaning English, and Germany dominates the economy with the other ""solid"" countries being fairly solid allies of Germany on the economic front.

From where I'm standing EU feels like Germany being the clear leader, but with a reasonable rebellion being led by Britain (which is listened to a lot by Germany's friends - countries like Finland, Netherlands etc definitely pay attention to Britain and are under severe cultural influence even if they agree *more* with Germany than with Britain for now). Then there's the ""troubled ones"" down south. And then there's France. Kind of alone, with maybe Belgium to hang out with.

There it is, France + Belgium, showing a brave face against the block that I'd loosely label ""Team browses internet in English and trades mainly with Germany"".



Still to your point... I do agree that we should do some more democratic reforms before we move the project forward. I also STRONGLY feel that we need a US style constitution that restricts what Brussels can and can not do. The problem with EU right now is that it's prone to undemocratic power grabs. I mean that's how it even came about, and an undemocratic power grab to contain rather jingoist masses was perhaps an even noble goal initially. Still, now we need some clear restrictions on what the EU can and can not do.

I still feel we should centralize a lot of things that are very cumbersome to do separately:

1) Embassies and Consulates (these should still have native speakers of all languages, but at least it'd be a single damn building in a central location, and probably also available in non-capital cities of most countries)

2) Certification and validation. Basically a European equivalent of the US FDA. Being able to launch products directly to all of EU after one process would be a GREAT help to new innovative companies in Europe.

3) Science funding. This should happen on multiple levels and it's actually going pretty ok as is. Still, I would love to have a permanent 5% of EU budget earmarked for doing Big Science.

4) I still think we would do well to join at least navies and air forces - the land units can be kept separate as the synergies in purchasing are far less significant and power projection using land units is not something Europeans are particularly keen on doing.

5) Central police operation that'd be a rather amped up version of Interpol with a primary mission of hunting down corruption (the constitution might even want to restrict the size and powers of this organization so we don't create a bloody DHS clone... that's the last thing anyone wants)

true,adamkex,SWED,Hungarian in disguise,"Honoring a terrorist is obviously extremely wrong and I would be embarrassed if I would live in that town. If one disagrees with Israeli foreign policy then there are different ways to show it than making a terrorist an honorary citizen. Shame on Bezons.

I understand that the influx of Muslim immigration is difference than the Jewish diaspora because as you just stated the Jews did not have a state. I am aware of what people are saying about this, it's everywhere in Europe. It's considered very controversial. Very many of us aren't scared at speaking out about our political ideals. I just don't share this opinion about Muslims and immigration.

However the common denominator between antisemitism up until the last 25 years ago and islamophobia (racism, xenophobia, nationalism, patriotism, call it whatever you like) today is that it is the same people and the same or ""reformed"" political parties and organizations. These organizations 40 years ago would think that you are scum and that Israel should be destroyed. It's only recently they started putting on a nice diplomatic suit and started attacking Muslims instead of Jews with a more diplomatic tone.

The ultra-religious people are in minority and the internet allows them and most importantly their critics to get a lot of attention. It's a win-win situation, both the critics (which many times have bad intentions) and the ultra-religious gain attention which allows them to rally up the weak-minded and lost young men because they offer companionship, fellowship and/or brotherhood. The problem with extremism (far-right, communist/anarchist, and Islamic) can't be solved by stopping immigration from Muslim countries and putting stricter laws on deportation. I believe that course of action is like putting fire to a leaking oil barrel and will set fire to all forms of extremism.

Here in Sweden I don't feel like Muslims have changed much other than providing us with foreign food and things like shisha. There were disproportionately many people in my school who were either foreign or had foreign heritage (many which were Muslim) and there wasn't a big difference between them and your average Swede.

Es ging um die alten Star Trek Filme (Kirk &amp; Co) und dass es ""teilweise am Rand des Laecherlichen"" (oder so) war (da haben sie die Szene eingeblendet als Spock den Rocker mit dem Ghetto-Blaster lahmlegte in Star Trek 4/im Bus in San Francisco in der Gegenwart.

Und dass Star Trek auch deshalb gut war, weil es auf das Alter der Crew einging, und nicht nur junge geleckte Crews praesentierte etc.

Gefolgt von weiteren Kommentaren, will jetzt nicht behaupten dass ich genau zugehoert habe, aber mein Gedanke nebenher war doch, dass sich alles was sie ueber Star Trek sagten, sich auf die Filme bezog.

Will ja nichts sagen, die Filme sind _OK_, vor allem mit ein paar Bier und wenn man Action will, aber sie haben nichts mit den Serien zu tun, vor allem nicht in der Charakterdarstellung!

Lets put some real examples in: You're saying €1bn will be raised by selling off a company that currently posts profits of around €250m per year. If those sort of statistics exist, then you're right. However I doubt they are profitable to that extent. And if they are, their IPOs are going to be massive, as in several billion € minimum.

The gambling company reported a profit of 500 million euros for 2012 (low compared to other years, because of the ongoing crisis). The state currently owns 34% of this company. The total amount the Greek state hopes to make out of ALL privitisations for 2013 (including selling all its stakes in the aforementioned gambling company,  as well as: the gas company, one municipal water company, a mining company, the post company, a few ports and some real estate) is 2.5 billion euros. You tell me if this is fair. 

&gt; The reason its smaller now is because of the policies they have been made to implement. It shrank by 75,000 in the last 1.5yrs according to Greece's finance minister. Greece agreed to cut it by 150,000. It is massively overstaffed. Thats established fact. Some of that info is here.

The article you mentioned proves nothing. Check eurostat numbers pre-crisis. 

&gt; What are you expecting? Greece's economy is the worst in Europe. Please propose alternative solutions that you can back up with real evidence.

We need to accept that Greece and other peripheral economies of the eurozone cannot compete with core economies as equals. Therefore, core economies need to either accept being paid less for what they produce (this can be achieved either by dissolving the euro and getting national currencies back or by fiscal transfers) OR they need to lower production since no one can afford their products and enter into recession themselves. Pick whichever of the above options you like as long as it doesn't involve destroying the social fabric of my birthplace.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; There is an alternate explanation to industries getting privatised: corruption.

Herein lies the problem. You're obviously aware of corruption at the highest levels of the Greek state. Are you suggesting these people will get rich from privatisation? (I'm genuinely asking that question, its not an attempt to annoy). Whilst this sort of corruption remains within Greek government, the problem won't be solved. No nation is going to plunge itself into recession to help a nation we know is corrupt from the top down.

With regards to the gambling privatisation, I see your point that it makes a very significant profit, but the problem is how little that will help. 34% of €500m is only €170m (and that's if 100% profit was handed to shareholders which obviously never happens). Its several years before that will pay off its own privatisation alone. You can argue the short-term gains of privatisation help little too. I fully grant you that it seems unfair, its just the tragic reality of a nation where debt-GDP sits at over 130%. And this is after a few years of posting sensational reductions in debt-GDP.

What are you trying to argue with regards to Greek public sector employment? Every news station in the world reports it as being bloated. Even with it being established fact that austerity sucks now, Greece's public sector remains overstaffed.

In that, they suggest having an EU-wide government responsible for foreign affairs, military policy (at least in so far as it falls under foreign affairs), and redistibutative welfare. This last would be based on cost of living in each district, with additional assistance for the long-term unemployed to move to areas of low unemployment.

Then there's the local government, responsible for roads, parks, rubbish, planning permission, and so on, operating on a scale similar to that of a borough or city-county council (with perhaps civil parishes if the locality desires).

Lastly, there's a ""national"", or perhaps ""ethnic"" government, responsible for social and cultural affairs: family law, education, and the like. A citizen's choice of ethnicity would then be made by free choice, irrespective of geographical considerations. (This has a certain analogy to the status of religion in the Ottoman Empire, or some parts of the British Empire, albeit with more freedom to change groups.)

As an example of how all that would work, consider the question of a  prostitute. The EU would specify what was an acceptable wage and enforce the payment agreed in their contract with the client, the municipality would decide where a brothel could be opened, or whether soliciting was permitted, and the national government would determine whether their citizens could employ prostitutes or engage in prostitution.

Die Polizei sollte eigentlich auch als moralische Instanz über jeden Zweifel erhaben sein.

Andererseits steht im Artikel, der Polizist habe dem gefesseten Opfer ""zwei mal ins Gesicht geschlagen"", so dass dieser ""damals Nasenbluten"" bekommen"" hatte. Es ist auch mehr als peinlich, dass der Polizist im ersten Verfahren alles geleugnet hat um nach der Aussage eines Kollegen gegen ihn in der Berufung zu gestehen - wohl um das Strafmaß zu senken.

Ich will das jetzt nicht kleinreden, es ist schlimm dass ein Polizist einen wehrlosen Menschen angreift.

Andererseits fände ich es auch fraglich, das Leben des Polizisten wegen einer Körperverletzung zu zerstören, da dieser bei einem härteren Urteil aus dem Dienst entlassen worden wäre und alle Pensionsansprüche etc. verloren hätte.

Richtig enttäuscht bin ich hingegen vom Rosenheimer Fall, bei dem der PolizeiCHEF eindeutig härter zugeschlagen hat.

true,groumpf,3,Lavapies,"Follow the links Aevum1 gave you. However, I want to add a couple of things.

Agencies take one month rent as a commission. This is not negotiable. You should decide whether that's worth the service they provide (for example, translation, and a bit of negotiation phase on the rent) before even contacting them: you don't want to view an amazing apartment to later realize that you don't want to pay the real estate agent.

Most flats we looked at when we arrived (2 bedrooms) were only available to rent by the year. I know that some places let you rent for shorter periods, but I don't know which. I'll try to ask my colleagues. We found ours through an idealista real estate listing (they are clearly marked).

You also pretty much need to carry your offer letter or work contract with you, as a foreigner.

People have asked us for 6 months rent as deposit. If that happens to you, walk away. However nice the place you just viewed, walk away.

Following Aevum1's advice to not give any money before signing, the standard warning to *demand* that the keys (and a receipt) be given to you in exchange for the deposit and first month's rent applies.

Spain, Greece, Ireland etc - all were growing then. The important thing is - did you actuall try to invest in the future then. Do those important structural reforms, etc? 

&gt;They are kind of interested. Berlusconi lost almost half of the votes (numerically; a bit less in percentages), and votes for Grillo are not for his agenda but just from the perception that everyone is the same among the politicians and everything should change

I do not really understand what you mean by that. From where I stand, you voted for a comedian and a corrupt slimeball. What is more important, are anyone of them working towards a change? Are anyone of them going to reform the tax system, lessen the corruption and please, start doing the structural reforms, Italy is in so dire need of? 

From where I stand, Italy has not voted for positive change. If I am wrong, explain how please, and who is going to enforce that positive change. 

&gt;Are they? If we have absolutely zero problems renewing our debt, it's because investors actually believe that the risk connected to our debt is in practice lower than what the interest rates say.

You have zero problems because the *ECB* is guaranteeing that investors will be paid back. You see, people have much more faith in the ECB, who is not run by the Italians, than Italy, who is.  In effect, that means that other countries tax payers are shouldering your risk. The minimum one could expect of the Italians is that they would at least initiate the necessary reform, but they basically gave a finger to everyone else, saying that they are not interested. 

But please, you do not seem to understand the fact that the Italian interest rate is low just because *other countries tax payers are carrying the risk for you*, so here are some articles that explain that.

[Here](http://www.voxeu.org/article/italy-spain-and-7-interest-rates) is how the situation was before. 

[Here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9428894/Debt-crisis-Mario-Draghi-pledges-to-do-whatever-it-takes-to-save-euro.html) is Mario Draghis ""whatever it takes"" speech, that *immediately* lowered the interest rates of Italy and Spain. Was that because the investors knew that the Italians would now be commited to end corruption, do structural changes etc? No, of course not - they knew that the German were the guarantee, not the Italians - that is why the interest rates sunk. If I am wrong, I'd like links and explanations as to why. 

[Here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9514153/Debt-crisis-OECD-backs-plans-for-ECB-bond-market-intervention.html) is about the ECB bond buying plan. Germans quit over that plan. Do you think they did it becasue a) they are being stupid and don't like Italians or b) because they know that shouldering someones elses debt, carrying their interest rate and laying out a plan for bond buying carries *real* costs for the tax payers. It actually doesn't matter whether the bonds are bought or not, the costs begin the second they take on the Italian risk. You claim that is not so. I'd like links and explanation to why you claim this. 

[Here](http://www.voxeu.org/article/ecb-no-free-lunch) is an interesting column about why the Italians should clean up their act (which they are not doing) Not really about the support from the ECB (it is a bit to early for that), but still, I mentioned it because it is written by an Italian to, and shows the Italian 2 -year spread. 

[Here](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fe833cfe-8015-11e2-adbd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2NJK7u9Jt) is about the predictament the Italian voters put themselves and the rest of the Eurozone tax payers in. 
 

Instead of denying the fact that the Italian interest rate is being kept artificially low by other countries, I would like for you to link me to articles in respectable journals and newspapers that back up your claim. Also, explain in detail why I am wrong. I have not read a lot, but about three semesters of economics, so I am familiar with the basics. I am starting to get tired of you denying it the fact that the Italian interest rate is kept low by other tax payers, without backing it up. I can access all major scientific journals, as well as major newspapers and magazines of course, and I speak English/German and of course the Scandinavian languages.

true,oroboros74,sicilia,null,"At 17, I think you will love your year abroad in Italy! 

I think it's more common than in the US for people to hang out with people younger and older than people you're age, so you won't necessarily be hanging out with other teenagers per se. There is more a sense of community, depending on which part of Italy you'd be visiting. 

My experience has taught me that you'll find many Italians who are in love with the US - either because of how it's represented in movies and TV or because they have relatives in the US. But you'll also find those that (relatively) hate the US (usually for the same reasons Reddit hates it!). 

If you let us know where you're going, maybe we can tell you more what to expect!

Tips? Bring gifts, candy, etc for your future friends. That's always nice. Learn some Italian, but be prepared to face some unintelligible Italian variant (or dialect). Don't be an asshole (e.g. go out for drinks but don't get shitfaced until the others do). Avoid being the stereotypical American (whatever that means).

The Confederation of Finnish Industries says there's no way in hell they're going to increase wages, and at least one of the trade union confederations (the biggest one, SAK) won't accept this. So this will dominate the news for a while. Might sound boring, but in a highly unionized country this is important stuff and affects more or less anyone who has a job...

true,bonzinip,ITAL,Italy,"&gt; did you actuall try to invest in the future then. Do those important structural reforms, etc?

We reorganized the monetary policy to not rely on devaluation and deficit, which is already a huge change. We had changes to the pension system, we introduced more flexibility in the work market.  A drop in the ocean, but we did do something. The problems stem from not continuing along that line.

&gt; From where I stand, you voted for a comedian and a corrupt slimeball.

Elsewhere in the thread you can read about the corrupt slimeball part.

About the comedian, you can read [here](http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/wumingblog/?p=1950) (just bullet 1 will do). I didn't vote for them, but in the end it was (in the intention of the voters) a vote for change. Will it bring positive change and structural reforms? I doubt that, but it is a vote for change and no one can deny that.

&gt; Are anyone of them going to reform the tax system, lessen the corruption and please, start doing the structural reforms, Italy is in so dire need of?

How can we do that without a clear majority in Parliament?

I'm not denying that the Italian interest rate is kept low by the risk being _potentially_ shouldered by other tax payers. I'm denying that Italian interest rate is kept low by money that has been forked out by the ECB with nothing in exchange. The Italian bonds bought in the Securities Market Programme did nothing to lower the rates (only the reforms done by Monti had an effect) and gave a very large interest.

And the surge in interest rates in June 2012 had absolutely nothing to do with lack of reforms. Speculation focused on Spanish and Italian bonds, and inflated the rates associated to those bonds, because of the risk associated with euro break-up. Not because of the risk associated with a default. So Italy and Spain were shouldering that part of the risk on part of the other European countries. Plus, northern countries can enjoy interest rates that are just as artificially low, which benefits the tax payers in those countries.

The situation in Italy sucks, and can only get worse.  Youth unemployment is a particularly bad indicator, and so is productivity. We do need some reforms, but lack of reforms is not the only reason why Italy interest rates are bad. And you cannot really deny that northern countries can only benefit from weaker southern Europe.",0,1363080240,null,0,false,0,c8u51jr,t3_1a2m6i,t1_c8u51jr,t1_c8u4mnk,null,1431559409,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

**Polictics**:

We have a big election year this year, so more to come from that side in the next threads, but that's the political landscape so far:

* The minister of defense stepped down after the disaster which was the referendum about the military service. Officially to manage the campaign for fall.
* Elections in 2 states  
** Carinthia: The right-wing party FINALLY lost the presidency, the splinter party of the FPÖ (right-wing) called FPK will be dismantled and integrated back into to the main party.   
** Upper Austria: The center-right president which has an absolut majority for about 30 years stays in power although loses votes (he still has over 50%). Frank Stronach (Magna founder and Neo-Austrian politician) got 10%
* FRANK: Another thing about Frank Stronach's party, he already bought a bunch of active parliament politicians from another party and is already in the federal parliament although he never got voted in.. (Not the first time this happens, we should REALLY change the laws that this shit isn't possible any more)
* New Party founded for the general election in fall: NEO (stupid, stupid name!) a liberal party which is, from their own description, contentwise the same like the already established liberal party (which didn't win a seat in an election in about 15 years)... So, good luck I guess?

**Economy**:

* Still some troubles with Hypo AlpeAdria, a bank the federal state bought from one of the states (Carinthia) 3 years ago. Much corruption, much hidden money 

* Eurofighter: Our internal well-known and hated fighters are in the news again. After about 5 years still only 10-20% are in working order, partially. Things like a 10 Mio radio system don't work because they haven't refitted the towers with the technology yet....

**Weather**:

* Go away winter! We don't like you anymore! But anyway, after a nice warm weekend it's raining now and the snow will be back end of this week :(

**Sports**:

* We pretty much sucked at the ski world championship we organised... Only the minor medals went to us

**Glamour**:

* We won 2 Oscars, bitches!

**Strange News**:

A Polish guy in Vienna cut off his own penis and ballsack in a public toilet and refused help afterwards....

There's no point in doing that when we can just alter EU law and slowly move towards a federal state.

So, why are you not electing someone with a clear majority that will tackle those things. You had one, but apparently you do not like reforms, nor honest politicians so you decided to vote him away. How can it be anyone else's fault? It is you who elect idiots, not us. 

&gt;The problems stem from not continuing along that line.

So, why don't you? What on earth is stopping the Italians from reforming? 

&gt;I'm not denying that the Italian interest rate is kept low by the risk being potentially shouldered by other tax payers. I'm denying that Italian interest rate is kept low by money that has been forked out by the ECB with nothing in exchange.

You do not seem to realise, that the fact that the Germans/Finns etc are shouldering the Italian risk (without the Italians doing any real changes) means that the *German* interest rate is higher than it should be, since it is the *total* risk calculated. That means, that every loan, any German takes, is more expensive, due to the *Italians*. Even if we are just talking hundreds here (example, interest rate 1,77 instead of 1,75) we are talking *billions and billions* of Euros. 

Think about another currency union, the US. If every state had the productivity of California, due you think the interest rate of the Fed would go up or down? Down, of course, since California in itself is the 20th largest economy in the world. However, the Feds interest rate gets calculated including Mississippi/Tennesse etc. So, the Californians pay more than they should, due to non productive states. It is the same in the Eurozone. However, in the US at least, they can demand and implement reforms to a much higher level from the federal government. 

It is the same with the ECB. The *total* interest rate is higher than it should be for the Finns/Dutch etc, just because they have to include the Italians in it.  The Italians answer this by basically giving the EZ the finger and electing a clown and Berlusconi. Every day you do not reform, a Finn is paying higher mortage on his house, than he should. Do you think it is fair?  


Honestly, you do not seem to know a lot about interest rates. The fact is, that the Italian behaviour is costing the rest of the EZ countries billions of Euros. How can you justify that, and how can you even deny that it is happening? 

&gt;And you cannot really deny that northern countries can only benefit from weaker southern Europe.

I can, and I just did. The costs are higher for them too, just because they have to shoulder the risk, as in having a higher interest rate.  And, they have to transfer money to the south (not Italy though, not yet). 

And, which is a whole different discussion, I personally think the Euro, in itself, is extremely imperfect and wrongly constructed. It is not a working currency union, not at all. I think a lot of countries should leave, and that it should be reconstructed, or dismantled in the whole. And, also with regards to the cost - right now it is costing Greece/Portugal/Spain/Ireland more, but in the end *no one* benefits from an extremely incorrectly constructed union. Everyone looses.

Und die zunehmende Polizeigewalt in Bayern ist keine Illusion: http://www.br.de/radio/bayern2/sendungen/zuendfunk/politik-gesellschaft/polizei-gewalt-muenchen-100.html

Es ist halt immer gleich Bayernbashing, wenn man irgendeine kulturelle Begebenheit hinterfragt....so wie jede Kritik am Staat Israel immer gleich Antisemitismus ist selbst wenn Kinder gefoltert werden.

Das Bayernbashing kommt ja nicht von ungefähr.
Wenn wenigstens die Politiker die ganz klar gegen europäisches und deutsches Recht sind weggesperrt werden würden wäre das schon was.
Nach EU &amp; deutschem Recht geht halt was Dobrindt fordert gar nicht...also die letzte Regierung die sowas gefordert hat war Hitlers NSDAP.

Mir soan mir, wenns um Homoehe geht. Mir soan mir, wenns um Solidarität geht. usw.
Den Bayern sind andere Menschen egal.

2x hat Deutschland die Bayern schon durchgefüttert. Einmal als die so bescheuert waren SchlossNeuschwanstein zu bauen und nix mehr zu essen hatten und dann nochmal 30 Jahre nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg.
Aber Mir-Soan-Mir meint bereits nachdem es grad mal 20Jahre n bisschen einzahlt für Projekte die ja unter Mitwirkung bayrischer Politiker geplant wurden nicht mehr solidarisch sein zu müssen.
Das ist Abspaltung pur und meinem Empfinden nach grundlage der bayrischen Kultur und vorallem Grund warum Schwule in einem ehemaligen KZ in München heiraten müssen, warum Bullen trotz Gewalt befördert werden, warum geistig Behinderte wie Strauss oder Stoiber ""regieren"" dürfen.
Noch heute läuft mir bei jeder Strauss Rede der Schauer den Rücken runter, wieviel Hass man gegen andere haben kann ist unglaublich.

z.b.: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvfyjLj0IVY

nur eklig. einfach nur eklig.
Und ich hab jetzt noch nie nen Bayern getroffen der sagt, ""oh, der strauss...das war aber ein extremist"" oder so...ne, ich höre nur sowas das du schreibst... ""der vater kam aber aus niedersachsen"" oder ""in anderen bundesländern wirds ja unmöglich besser sein.""

Es geht also um die grundsätzliche Rückständigkeit der bayrischen Gesellschaft. Nicht du, aber die Mehrheit der Bayern lebt in den 50ern.

Ok, next time we'll have igelkotten come down and do the elections for us.

It makes no sense to say ""elect someone with a clear majority"".  If you have &gt;2 parties, it is obviously possible that none gets 50%.

&gt; &gt; The problems stem from not continuing along that line.
&gt; 
&gt; So, why don't you? What on earth is stopping the Italians from reforming?

Two reasons. One is Berlusconi. Honestly I have no problem with those who voted him in 1994 and 2001.  I do have a problem with those who voted him in 2008 and 2013, after the awful management (and failure to respect promises) he exhibited in 2001-2006 and 2008-2011. But you can read elsewhere in this page how he got re-elected.

The second is that austerity sucks big. I agree that a large part of it was necessary, but it still sucks. Austerity is not about removing waste, it's about finding money. And if things got worse for you because of austerity, you do not vote for the people who approved those measures.

&gt; However, the Feds interest rate gets calculated including Mississippi/Tennesse etc. So, the Californians pay more than they should, due to non productive states.

That's just stupid. There are no eurobonds, which would be the equivalent of US bonds. The German are rightly against them, because they would behave like you write. But until each country has its own sovereign debt, the differences tend to get amplified instead. When Italian and Spanish interest rates soared, Germany was loaning money at almost-negative rates. Now that Italian and Spanish rates are more reasonable, German rates are raising.

&gt; Honestly, you do not seem to know a lot about interest rates.

And you seem to consider interest and emitter risk the same thing. Of course they are related, but there are other risks (e.g. euro break-up risk) and those can affect the interest rates of different countries both positively and negatively.",0,1363088278,null,0,false,0,c8u5u4f,t3_1a2m6i,t1_c8u5u4f,t1_c8u5g9o,null,1431559758,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm sure a lot of the smaller ones at least wouldn't mind if the whole thing got wrapped together and even the foreign policy regarding these countries being done together. More controversial ones like Israel might never get brought together.

#4 This would have to be done with a join budget. De facto it might be run by the Brits or the French, but at least they wouldn't be only spending their own tax payers money (give UK the Admiralty and France the ""marines"" or whatever equivalent mobile force we might have while leaving the massive land armies out of it and perhaps throw Air Force to relatively neutral ground in, say, Netherlands).

Of course #4 is pretty full federal in a way that #1 isn't - there's just no leaving once your navy is jointly owned. 


#5 Is just me being concerned about corruption in some of the Southern and Eastern member states.

&gt;It makes no sense to say ""elect someone with a clear majority"". If you have &gt;2 parties, it is obviously possible that none gets 50%.


Frankly, no one can fix Italy but the Italians, but as you so blatantly have made clear to us, you do not want to. I think that says a lot. 

Sweden has a minority government, 8 parties in the parlament, and we are doing fine. So is Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland. The key is to actually realise that stuff has to change, and have all the major parties agree to that. So, don't blame it on not having the same system as the US/UK  -they are not doing to well either btw. 



&gt;The second is that austerity sucks big. I agree that a large part of it was necessary, but it still sucks. Austerity is not about removing waste, it's about finding money. And if things got worse for you because of austerity, you do not vote for the people who approved those measures.

I know austerity sucks big time (nor do I agree with it), but if you do not like it - leave the currency union then (which I think you should, but not soleley for not liking austerity, I think the Euro as a union suck, and the leadership sucks too). Italy/Spain/Greece, have had a loss in internal competitiveness since 2001-2008 which is the equialent of 20-30 % (Eurostat). Also, Italy has had a a trade deficit for ages - that meanst that you have to borrow money.  So, unlike before you can not write down the Italian currency to make people buy your products, to make it cheaper to invest. The only think you can do to increase your competition is to lower the costs and one of the biggest costs is salaries and the state expenses. 

Also, that is no argument for not dealing with corruption, tax evasion and structural reforms. If you did those stuff, you would be 3/4 of the way. 


&gt;That's just stupid. There are no eurobonds, which would be the equivalent of US bonds. The German are rightly against them, because they would behave like you write. But until each country has its own sovereign debt, the differences tend to get amplified instead. When Italian and Spanish interest rates soared, Germany was loaning money at almost-negative rates. Now that Italian and Spanish rates are more reasonable, German rates are raising.

The German rates are rising exactly because of the reasons *I said - the Germans are paying for the Italian risk*. You just quoted that I was right!

You do not seem to understand that the Euro is a currency union? And thus, the interest rates gets calculated like other currency unions (like the US and Germany, or the UK for example). Are you denying that? You honestly do not even seem to calcualate the economics of currency unions in your answer. 

 The action (or the lack of them in Italy's case) reflects on *all* the countries in the union, and thus, on the interest rate. Don't you get that? Are you saying that I am wrong about this.

Besides, you still haven't posted *links*, which I asked of you, to why the artificial propping up isn't happening. 

Also, are you saying that my example with the interest rates being higher for the Finns (for example) than it should be is wrong? If so, why, and links please. Because if it is right, you are admitting to costing tax payers in the Eurozone billions every day, since the Italians risk is included when a Finn pay for his/hers mortage. 

So, if I am wrong about that, I would like for you to explain why, *with* links to credible newspapers and academic journals. You do not seem to want to do that. Otherwise, I will not believe you, since I do not think you can have any credible links.

The euro has been saved, but it will not survive over the long term without a banking union that includes crisis resolution mechanisms and pan-European deposit insurance. Nor will it survive without a budget worthy of the name, pooling of debt and a much more effective coordination of economic policies.

But this ^ doesn't make the least bit of sense to me. ""The EU has lost the trust of it's citizens, so what we should do is something **entirely unrelated to the issue**?"" Why?

I don't trust the EU. Why? Because of the ""banking crisis""? No! That's the business of local administrations allowing for the causes of it.

I'm not trusting it because it's an organisation that has done nothing to earn my trust and everything to undermine it! The Bologna reform was the worst thing happening to the educational system in decades, all the politicians that are sent there are people who have fucked up in national politics and want a quiet job like that lying asshole Gutenberg, who for some reason, is now advisor for Internet affairs. The point of ""having lost trust"" isn't just monetary. There is no goal for the EU (as for national politics in my country for that matter). They had the goal of reducing poverty once (I heard). That didn't work out so well did it... They were supposed to be a democratic organization, yet for everything important, like foreign policy for example, the stances of the individual countries have to adapt to the general european position, whatever that is supposed to mean. The liberalisation of the markets is in theory a good thing, it's just the absolute worst thing to do if every single cartel controlling institution doesn't even try to do their job. What about free speech? Yeah not thanks, it could ""undermine unity"", ""threaten relations"". Aren't we supposed to be friends? Is that what friends do? Lie to each other for the sake of their friendship?

I absolutely love the idea of a united europe, where everyone is treated equaly and has equal opportunities and is happy.

But that's not going to happen with governance. How hard the disconnect is, imo is very well visible in the media sites of the EU. Noone looks at them. The channels of EU representatives have rarely over 100 subscribers, Press releases with a visting counter or documents with a view counter don't really rise to the heights needed for active democratic envolvement.

The banking crisis **is not** the main reason for the distrust. The main reason for the distrust is that the EU is a mostly inaccessable, secretive, governance institution that doesn't a give anything about principles that could mean something to it's citizens.",1,1363089758,null,0,false,0,c8u6175,t3_1a4zrs,t1_c8u6175,t3_1a4zrs,null,1431559851,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Gut, das Wort behindert war wohl Jugendsprech...das kommt vllt auch irgendwann in Bayern an, geht aber WIEDER am Thema vorbei.
Verstehe ich dich richtig, dass du der Meinung bist, dass man eine spezifische Zivilgesellschaft nicht als rückständig bezeichnen darf?
Oder ist das auch so ein Bayern-Ding?
Ich bin durchaus der meinung das man Zivilgesellschaften, z.B. die Taliban, als rückständig bezeichnen darf.
Und auch die Bayern darf man als Rückständig bezeichnen, z.B. wenn in der westlichen Welt aufgrund von Erkenntnissen Entscheidungen getroffen werden und Bayern diese nicht mitträgt..z.B. Gleichstellung von Partnerschaften.
Die Schweiz hat z.B. lange gebraucht Mann&amp;Frau gleich zustellen..und die Taliban oder Iraner brauchen dafür nochmal 100 Jahre.
Alles in allem sind diese Gesellschaften RÜCKSTÄNDIG.
Und das kann und sollte man auch genau so sagen.

bzgl. Schloss Neuschwanstein...ich hab kein Bock jetzt bei GoogleBooks nach authentischen Berichten zu suchen und in news.google.de ist sowas natürlich genauso wenig wie in dem 10000x bearbeiteten wikipediaEintrag. 
Frag mal in ner Bücherei oder nen Geschichtslehrer oder so, wer denn nach der Königskatastrophe von 1886 das Essen nach Bayern geliefert hat.
Ludwig II. allein hatte etwa 14,5 Millionen Mark (= 600 Jahresgehältern eines Staatsministers) und dazu kamen dann noch diverse weitere Schulden die dann größtenteils getilgt wurden von König Otto I....und der war ja kein Bayer sondern kam aus Memleben.
Also der Deutsche König hat ca. 75% der Schulden Bayerns bezahlt.

vielleicht ist das n anfang: http://www.bayerische-staatszeitung.de/index.php?id=132&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=1550&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=115

It didn't matter much at all in Ivan's time, just as the people do not matter in a place like Saudi Arabia where the riches come out of the ground rather than the labour of the people. 

It is giving in to fascism and nationalism that is the real point, and we must never forget the ways in which it happened and how those lessons are relevant to all modern societies. There are many other examples that we need to learn from, but I think the reason why the German example springs most readily to mind are obvious.

Do I think limiting the time available for study, a grading system based on the process and not the product, split into modules that don't make sense and that don't serve the purpose they were invented for, namely making modules credible across europe and relies on private funding for research projects and university expenses is a bad idea for a system that needs independent critique from the most capable people? Yes I do.

&gt;Of course they've to take stances on European position, because foreign policy affects EU as a whole.

Can you please tell me how the individual opinion of a country affects the foreign policy accepted in the parliament or the respective institution? Can't we disagree nationally and still follow the doctrine outwards?

&gt;And where do they not do their job?

They don't do their job in cases of: banks, public services , IT companies like facebook, mircrosoft, apple, newscorporations like the major newspaper publishers and sometimes television companies, internet providers that have large monopolic coverages. Obviously they didn't do their job if they have allowed companies to get too big to fail, because that's a symptom of monopolies.

Btw **why can't we have open source operating systems, system security and messaging services on the encryption level they use for their top secret files**? That would protect their people. I'd even pay for that. Which would create incentive to have the absolute best information security because there are so many companies and persons in europe who want that level of protection and who would pay a ton of money for it.

&gt;No one looks at them, because people don't even know that they exist, and if they knew, they'd probably be interested.

No no one looks at them because they're spread over hundreds of different websites without cross links, containing documents hundreds of pages long that no human can possibly read or understand for themselves, saying essentially ""we'll try x"" with many fancy words. 

No one honors the treaties. Why read them?

&gt;The main reason for the distrust is that the EU is a mostly inaccessable,secretive

Ok. Can I meet my representative? Can I see what he voted on? Can I see his direct opinions on the topics? Can I see who he talked to before he made that decision, his advisors, sponsors, friends in political parties, political opinion? No I can't. Not legally. I'd have to use the surveilance aparatus created ""for our safety"" to monitor that in some cases. Even if you argue I could scavange my information about them from the various resources that do exist, that just proves my point that I have to do that.

&gt;&gt;governance institution that doesn't a give anything about principles that could mean something to it's citizens.
&gt;And bullshit again. It seems you just talk, without knowing anything about the topic at hand. 

Right, then tell me the last time a political person has defended someones rights. 

If they actually stand for free speech, why is ecuador the only country that has offered Julien Assange asyl? If they want peace, why does noone speak up against the wars financed and supported and most importantly enabled by weapon exports by the EU in the middle east?  

&gt;Bullshit.

I respect that you trust the EU. I respect that you voice your opinion. I do not respect that you just dismiss my points.

&gt;There's a problem with free speech?

What do you mean? There are always companies interested in their PR trying to suppress bad press. There are always parties trying to present themselves in the best possible light. There is always a problem with free speech. It gets really bad if you think it's somehow safe against the constant gradual assault of people who like the worldview twisted in their favor.

&gt;It seems you just talk, without knowing anything about the topic at hand. 

I do not know enough about individual topics to nail someone against the wall with arguments or quotes. I just notice how slippery and empty most politicians argue these days and how less they care when they are out of office.

I know that we are making wars that many are against. I know we saved banks which many were against. I know that certain policies affect me whether I want to or not. I know that these processes are ultimately beyond my control. The best I can hope is that the next candidate of the 5 parties in my country isn't a complete moron and that he wins.

If you're looking for pubs, there's a few places in Paris that are pleasant. *Place Monge* for instance, on the subway 7, has tons of little good pubs, sometimes easly crowded though. In a more touristic way, all around *Saint Michel* you'll find pubs.

If you never went to Paris, and are interested by the city, you obviously have some must-see to do. Louvre, Eiffel Tower and so on. But those are obvious.
Between guys (or even with girls though) the *Moulin Rouge* is quite a show !
I highly recommend Paris by night too, the city gets even more beautiful when darkness rises :)

Is it your first time to Paris ? Have you a specific type of thing you want to do / visit ? Any preferences ?

They paid 0 in taxes. Considering that taxes are the government's ""salary"", in what way is this at all beneficial to the individual taxpayer?

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

That has fuck-all to do with caps on corporate tax(which don't have by the way). What, do you think our corporate tax rate is capped at 0% or something?

When dealing with offshore income ask yourself a few questions: Was the income generated by the US, was the product sold to the US, and how many of the resources were based in the US? Only after those 3 questions have been answered will you be able to have any idea of what you're dealing with...but in any case you will *not* be dealing with a cap on taxes because we don't have one.

&gt;Bill Clinton put us in a budget surplus[2] by raising the tax rates, then W came along and not only allowed corporations breaks they don't need, but actually mailed every tax-paying citizen a check. 

Bill Clinton presided over the .com bubble boom *and* the Glass Stegall repeal that inflated the housing market. The surplus was the equivalent of walking down the road and finding a $100 bill. It was not a sustainable, repeatable strategy.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; I just didn't look up the figures.

Admittedly, I was confused by the desire to privatise several very profitable industries. So I did look this up. According to the Greek government's own privatisation handbook, [here,](http://www.minfin.gr/content-api/f/binaryChannel/minfin/datastore/65/26/56/652656f9bc7ea78c3bc688ea19a68ce737f27361/application/pdf/Hellenic_Privatizations_powerpoint_English.pdf) these industries are losing €1bn per year and currently have €10bn accumulated debt (page 5).

OPAP posted profits of €575m, though TrainOSE S.A., as an example, has net income of -€187m. Hellenic Railways Organisation, a separate company, has net income of -€950m.

&gt; by privatising OPAP the state loses 34% of 500 million per year

This is only true assuming that OPAP pays 100% of its profits to shareholders. I highly doubt that is the case, but would happily be proven otherwise. OPAP paid a dividend of €229,680,000 from its 2011 financial report (i.e. paid out in 2012). [Here.](http://www.opap.gr/documents/11503/182630/fs+ENG+2011.pdf) That document makes clear the dividend payout was not 100%. The Greek government received 34% of that figure.

&gt; What makes you think that private sector ownership will make it more profitable?

Basic privatisation history. These companies will benefit from private sector ingenuity, for instance becoming more labour efficient. Most first world countries have privatised core industries like this, precisely because it is in the state's interest to do so.

OPAP is profitable as it is, and hence privatising this one industry is questionable. Though its had recent bad news from the ECJ and its profits are falling. The gamble being taken will be that privatisation will make it even more profitable, thus accruing the Greek government great income in the long-term.

true,depth_breadth,BULG,Bulgaria,"&gt;they can't honestly expect to get anywhere when they don't recognise an EU member state. 

After reading this, one would be left with the impression that Turkey invaded Cyprus after it became a member state. Quite the contrary, Turkey and Turkish Cypriots actually supported the unification of the island during the [Annan Plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annan_Plan_for_Cyprus) prior to its accession. Let us not forget who it was that rejected the plan that would have allowed the whole island to enter the Union as a single united country. 

&gt; they cannot be an EU member without destroying what it means to be an EU member.

The EU has destroyed that on its own. The accession of a country which was at war with its other half, and had no de facto control over all of its territory should never have happened. The EU usually boasts about how candidate countries must have good neighborly relations with their neighbors, and not be in a state of war, and treat minorities right. Did the Greek Cypriot government meet any of those requirements when it was admitted?

In fact, safe in the knowledge that they would be admitted to the Union no matter what, the Greek Cypriots rejected the Annan plan, and a week later Cyprus became an E.U. state. European officials, and especially Günter Verheugen, the E.U. enlargement commissioner at the time, even said that they felt betrayed.

&gt; “The understanding was quite clear when we gave Turkey candidate status in 1999 and even clearer when we concluded negotiations with Cyprus in 2002: The Greek Cypriots would not allow the peace plan to fail, and if it failed due to the Turkish Cypriots, then Cyprus could join,” Mr. Verheugen said.

&gt; “We came very close. The problem was that in the end, we didn’t have any leverage over the Greek Cypriots anymore since they knew they would join anyway,” added Mr. Verheugen, who is now honorary professor of European governance at the European University Viadrina in Germany. 

Source: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/business/global/european-unions-leverage-over-cyprus-is-ephemeral.html?_r=0

Despite all of its promises of lifting the economic isolation on the Turkish Cypriots, the EU has not fulfilled any of them, and the North remain as isolated as ever. The official Turkish position is that they recognize the rights of Turkish Cypriots to self-governance. Pending a resolution to the conflict, Turkey will never recognize the Greek Cypriots as the sole government as that would contradict their support for the Turkish Cypriots. So to expect Turkey to recognize the government in the South as the sole representative is unrealistic because it would undermine the negotiating position of the Turkish Cypriots.

Of course I know that, and I believe it's a valid point. Why should Greece accept negotiations on ""grey zones""? Even more so, why should they link maritime law with Turkey's wishful thinking, lending them legitimacy? To continue with my ""neighbour's house"" analogy, that would be like throwing his Ferrari in the mix. So, instead of only disputing his ownership of the property, I'm also disputing his car? A settlement from the Hague might say ""alright, you get the Ferrari, he keeps the house"", because maritime law is different from property law. Colombia vs. Nicaragua is an interesting example of that.

&gt; let me just link a few maps for perspective. This is the current maritime boundary. This is what the Greek government believes the boundary should be.

Yes, that's what the law allows. It's a legitimate demand. What's the problem? And why shouldn't they pursue those borders, aside from ""Turkey doesn't like it""?

&gt; [...] it's not difficult to understand why Turkey has declared the issue to be casus belli if Greece goes ahead with implementing its demands.

I understand that they might have a problem with that. It still has no legal basis. Just as I have no legal basis squatting on my neighbour's place because ""I don't like that he's blocking my view"".

If Turkey wants access routes, they should negotiate with the Greek state for an acceptable solution and the international law of the sea has provisions specifically for these kinds of situations. Just as every single ship that has to go through the Bosporus has to follow Turkish law and international treaties.

It is a shock response to worsening economic growth by preventing increase demand on the budget. It WILL NOT improve economic growth, it is not meant to.  The spending on infrastructure, the suggested alternative, is also a stop gap, meant to maintain industries of importance during periods of low demand until better conditions, similar how the New Deal allowed industries to survive until the rebuilding boom of WW2.

   The opening of new markets, the development of new products, the lowering of industry barriers, the finding of new resources and improving efficiency of production of basic goods improves the economy, increasing employment and industry diversification. Austerity and Keynesian spending are methods of enduring bad economic conditions, for a while atleast, until these events come into play.

edit: Both Austerity and Keynesian spending are valid strategies, one prevents budgetary over-extension, the other industry-decimation. Their effectiveness depends on exterior circumstances and prior events (keynesian spending works best if you have national savings to spend, to avoid raising taxes or borrowing money), they are not mutually exclusive.

Sicherlich begründet sich die Jagd nicht in dem Argument ""schützt die arme natur"" - der Antrieb für die Jagdausübung besteht darin Beute zu machen (unabhängig von der persönlichen Motivation des einzelnen Jäger zu werden). Um dieses Ziel (Beute) auch zukünftig erreichen zu können bedarf es den Schutz und einer nachhaltigen Bewirtschaftung der Wildbestände (der Gesetzgeber spricht in diesem Zusammenhang von Hegepflicht). Der Schutz des Wildes wiederum ist - so lehrt die Ökologie - läßt sich aber ohne Habitatschutz nicht verwirklichen.
