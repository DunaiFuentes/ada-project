Foreign policy: We've fought together since 1859, especially WWI and WWII. We were superpowers at the same time, which Churchill (half-American) certainly believed was a force for good.

Obama has seemed more 'anti-UK' than previous Presidents, yet during the election debates he criticised Romney for insulting ""our closest ally"".

Economics: UK and US are each others largest source of foreign direct investment. Not to mention the banking links between London and New York.

Culture: Language etc. It obviously makes a difference in forming the relationship and in conducting it. Plenty of other nations speak English, but at this point the US-UK relationship is so much stronger than others.

Personal: Don't be fooled by recent times. There has been many strong personal relationships between the PM and President. And there will be again. Blair and Bush just soured it for a while.

This is something that's inherently wrong with many societies. One's social status should not be tied to the nature of one's job and further more, construction jobs, cleaning jobs and the like are VERY important jobs. And the only ones that say they are ""simple jobs"" are the ones who never worked a day in their lives.


Secondly, the current wave of immigrants are people with degrees.

If they really want to shoot down those possible missiles (yes, those countries don't even have them), they would do it from Saudi-Arabia or Japan...

What comes to the Russian missiles, it just makes them change their strategy: nuke that patriot-complex first.

The biggest advantage of that plan was the radar and sigInt they could get from east. And even that was so little. They got those things in Baltic.

And Russia could park their nuclear subs anywhere on seas and launch there.

And tomorrow there is drones with stealth and nukes. This Patriot system is old and useless. And costs more than three Brigades of modern fighters.

Being a native English speaker already qualifiers you for private English lessons and as a tourist guide. There is demand for good English speakers in all sectors because Germany has an export oriented economy.
All big cities also have an anglo expat community that has its own little micro economy.
Prostitution is legal in Germany if you get desperate. 

Apply for a student visa and go to university, or a trade apprenticeship.

&gt;Do Germans have a ROTH IRA or a 401k savings plan or some..thing? 

Yes, there is similar stuff. Most Germans retire in their early 60s.

&gt;Do your banks have a high interest rate? 

That changes with the economy. But generally no. The economy and the currency is pretty stable.

true,Radegar,CZEC,Czech Republic,"- It's extremely simplistic to boil it down to 'religion or race'. Religion is a very large part of the cultural identity of any person, just as Christianity is it in your country. And there are many different degrees of being religious, while still identifying yourself as belonging to a certain religion, to the point of just being ""cultural Christian"" or ""cultural Muslim"".

No, it's not simplistic at all - it's the only way, you can't accuse someone of being racist because he dislikes this or that religion. Religion and to some degree culture is something you can choose, race you cannot.

- While in your example you are probably against fundamentalist Islam, which we can certainly agree is a very bad influence, you for some strange reason decide to paint everyone who calls themselves a Muslim with this brush.

Atleast we can agree on something. 

- In doing so you target people, who do not share the fundamentalist views that you seem to subscribe to all Muslims. I have friends and colleagues who are Muslim, and good and hard working citizens of my country, but you want to destroy their lives and uproot them from everything they know simply because of their cultural identity. Certainly you can see how that is offensive to me. Not least to them.

No, no. Who today doesn't have a muslim friend. I have few muslims friends myself. I can respect their opinions even though I always show my big disagreement with them. I know only one muslim who calls himself muslim because of his parents influence. Most are proud, even so, they drink, smoke weed and touch women without any kind of muslim morale - they live their lives just like any other people. But when it comes to more serious debate, they never say that they strongly oppose sharia law or terrorists, their opinions are usually cloudy - that is what I find dangerous.

- And if we are to pursue the issue of religion and race further, and how they conflate at times, you would do well to read up on the history of the Jews.

Please, not this again. Jews never forced their views and religion on others.

- I don't know why you'd presume to know anything about the extent of my knowledge.

Well, since you brought up my views on Islam into the debate where it doesn't matter at all.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I know that there are still money transfers from western to eastern Germany, it's quite a good comparison. 

Unfortenately yes, 23 year afterwards, and counting. That is one of the many reasons I'd leave the Euro if I were you. 


&gt; There was no referendum about the euro or the Lisbon treaty. Why? 

Wouldn't you, at the time though, still have voted yes? 

&gt;I can imagine that the north isn't happy about what's happening in the south, but you can be sure that this mess was created by all of us. 

No, of course the mess weren't created by all of you, or even any of you. What I mean is that the loss in competitiveness that has happened is not ""created"" by anyone, it is what happens in a currency union, that is ""Economics 101"". It is not because anyone is corrupt or lazy.

That said, I am not overly impressed with what I have learned about the Greek/Italian corruption, and the lack of willingness to battle it + the fact that they do not seem willing to even start do necessary structural changes.

I am, and I think I can speak for a lot of people in Europe, not prepared to do those things that one did in West Germany to offset/balance what is happening in the south. I am not prepared to send 20 % of our GDP in the south, pay off Spain's debt, keep Portuguese schools going etc. Not because I particularely hate the south or think it deserves what is happeing to them, but becuase *I do not want to be one country/one union*. Those thing, like in Germany, is things one do in one country, another fine example of that would be the US. I don't want to have a say in Spainish politics, and I most definately do not want them to have a say in Swedish. Basically, to save the Euro, properly, we would all have to become a united states of Europe, for real, and I really, really do not want that. I can imagine that a lot of people in the south feel the same - we are not one people and frankly, why would we want to be one country? 

&gt;Yesterday, we were informed that, with luck, the austerity will end in 2040, we already have a huge social crisis, does this sound feasible?

That actually sounds pretty likely.

&gt;I wonder what would have happened if we just left the euro?! Could it really be much more painful than it already is? Oh but believe me, if Portugal or Greece or any country leaves the euro now the shit storm will hit everyone.

I think it is smart to leave the Euro, it will be a short shitstorm, but I think you would start to regain your competitiveness within a year, and at least your destiny will be in your hands. 

What I also think will happend if you leave, that you will force other countries to leave, like Greece, Spain and Italy, whether they want to or not. See, then the investors know that countries leaving will be a reality, and their interest rates will go through the roof. The ECB can not, nor do they have the money to, buy bonds for all of the south, all of the time. So, if one country leave, the whole deck of cards will fall. 

We live in interesting times indeed...

Also let's scrap the huursubsidie first and add scheefwoontax (increase in rent of social housing for those that are earning lots and not moving out), and then we'll talk about scrapping de hypotheekrenteaftrek.

On the other hand, this region lives because of tourism, and that sector is still growing. If you can start a business in anything tourism-related, you can still make a living.

Also, cost of life is lower than it was in Belgium (can't compare to Italy or Scotland, though). If you don't have loans to pay off, it's perfectly possible to live of off the SMIC - though obviously it won't make you rich.

Has that kind of transfer happened peacefully before? Will it ever happen peacefully again?

This will be discussed and puzzled over by historians for many generations to come. Trade, language and shared values were big factors. We have much in common with Europe now, and the wars changed much about how different parts of Europe governed themselves. One hates to bring it up but it's not that long since public discourse in Germany contained debates on whether Germans were even capable of democracy. Now it seems almost trite to point out that their current system is probably more democratic than ours. 

Pre-war we were much closer to what the US is now, and since then we have become more socialist whilst Europe has become much more democratic and trade oriented in general. We had more in common with the US. Our interests and values were much the same. We have common values with both Europe and the US now. Everyone in Europe has moved closer to each other.

The Netherlands is also chipping in, but it'd be fair to say that part (if not all) of the money we use to bail countries out is easily compensated by the tax we practically steal from EU countries(and other countries in the world) that need it more. (Many Southern European corporations of the largest sort have their official office in the Netherlands just to avoid higher taxes in their own country.)

The countries bailing out Cyprus want them to shrink their financial sector, and I guess that is rather convenient for other tax havens in the EU.

Oh, and before I forget, the Netherlands is a ""nice"" tax haven either. Even dictators like Khadaffi used to have their official address/office in the Netherlands.

true,anocrazybear,null,null,"c'est un mélange incohérent d'idées loin d’être claires et réalistes du milieu.
Un coup c'est le marketing qui mets en avant les babes dans les publicités du produit. Je remarque assez rapidement que TF1 diffuse Splash en ramenant une armée de ""babes"" et fait en sorte que les plans séquences s'attardent sur les fesses des candidates, ou sur leur décolletés. Au final quel est la différence spécifique des éditeurs de jeux vidéos et n'importe quel programmeur de divertissement? Un autre coup c'est les organisateurs d’évènements comme ESWC. Quel est la différence entre l'ESWC qui ramène des pom pom girls pour combler les vides dans leur show E-sport, et la NBA et la NFL qui font exactement la même chose depuis des années. Est ce pour cela que la NBA n'est pas un sport mature?

Elle touche au cas du journalisme de jeu vidéo, et que le contact dans les salons de jeux vidéos est parfois très macho et sexiste. Puis je demander en quoi cela est différent en foot par exemple? ou dans le sport en général. Je me souviens d'une affaire ou un reporter se faisait sculpter du regard dès qu'elle débarquait sur un terrain de foot. Avec même des sportifs qui s'y mettaient. A nouveau, qu'elle est la spécificité du milieu du jeux vidéo ici?

Prenez, l'exemple cité de Miranda et son coach Aris. Cela rentre dans un tout autre cadre: le sexisme relativement à la joueuse pro. Il est indéniable que les choses ont visiblement dérapé, mais à l'origine des ces conneries réside son propre coach!! Avant le dérapage il y a tout une logique de marketing. Ces équipes de joueurs électronique, sont rémunérées par l'exposition qu'elles amènent à leurs sponsor. Quand CapCom essaye d'inviter des très bons joueurs féminins, ils sont dans la même logique que des organisateurs de compétitions féminines de tennis. Ces dernières font un buzz, autour de Kournikova, de Selena, Higgins et autres figures sexy et promues comme telles. Attirant ainsi des spectateurs qui ne se seraient jamais intéressé au tennis, pour finalement admirer des talents très nettement inférieurs aux prouesses offertes par les compétitions masculines. Une joueuse professionnelle de jeu vidéos aura beaucoup plus de facilité -à niveau égal avec un joueur masculin- à se trouver un sponsor. Allez sur twitch, et vous comment une fille niveau Gold à SC2, fait autant de spectateurs, qu'un mâle niveau Grand Master!!

Ensuite, viens l'attitude des consommateurs/jouers de jeux vidéos avec les joueurs professionnels, en particulier les femmes. Quand c'est une femme qui stream sur twitch par exemple, elles se retrouvent face à une masse de questions sexistes. Mais quand c'est un homme, le harcèlement, les insultes, les moqueries sont multipliées par 10! Prenez un joueur charismatique de la scène américaine de StarCraft2: InControl. Il se fait insulter, du fait de son niveau et de sa corpulence à raison de 2 insultes par min, surnommé: Incholestérol, InFatIroll. C'est de tout aussi mauvais gout qu'un type qui envoie à Eve [joueuse Starcraft 2] une photo de sa bite en train d’éjaculer sur une photo d'elle via twitter. A un moment faut apprendre à bloquer et ignorer. 

Il y a aussi énormément de réfections à faire sur les jeux vidéos eux mêmes. J'ai simplement 2 points importants:

- le marketing du jeu vidéo s'oriente beaucoup vers le casual, en créant des jeux de plus en plus faciles. L'objectif étant de vendre ce jeux à la sortie et de l'oublier. Dans le cas cas de TombRaider, on a l'impression que c'est un jeu fun ou l'on incarne une nana plantureuse et forte... mais en réalité c'est un jeu gore, ou les personnages secondaires masculin se sacrifient en chaîne pour sauver l’héroïne des griffes d'une horde de sauvageons armés.

- On critique les scénarios ""machos"" des jeux vidéos. La raison pour laquelle on joue ces jeux ne peut être un scénario si simpliste que 3 phrases suffisent à le résumer. Les non joueurs doivent comprendre que c'est le gameplay [l'ambiance, et la manière de passer les niveaux] qui font qu'un jeu est culte.",1,1363526455,null,0,1363529980,0,c8x7w2y,t3_1afife,t1_c8x7w2y,t3_1afife,null,1431612919,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

Underpinning capitalism is the love of money, this pollutes everything.
  
We worship youth and beauty to the point where it is possible to be famous for just being famous, as opposed to actually being able to do anything outstanding or contributory.

We look down on most of the rest of the (poorer) world and either exploit them and their resources or feel we have to 'save' them with aid.  Sometimes both at the same time.

We allow large corporations to become so powerful that they will soon be able to change the weather, let alone virtually force feed us cheap food that is bad for us.  By 'us' I mean the poorer people that live in western countries.  This is one of the first things that we export to countries that are becoming Westernised.

I'd advise you to look for something either downtown, but that's going to be really expensive, or in the south of the city - Le Pigonnet, le pont-de-l'arc or around the Facultés (the local universities), although most student housing will be occupied at this time of year. If you don't mind taking the bus, there are quite a few villages around Aix - Luynes, Eguilles, Le Tholonet - where housing may be less expensive. It depends where your classes will be. 

You may also want to contact the Erasmus student club - here's their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/323608041062039/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts).

Nella mia vita non ho mai nascosto la mano dopo aver tirato il sasso e non inizierò a farlo ora per convenienza personale o di immagine.
Ne' vorrei che scelte personali dettate esclusivamente dalla mia coscienza e dagli eventi vissuti sabato pomeriggio portassero danno o sospetti (completamente infondati) su quella parte maggioritaria di cittadini Senatori che ha votato nel ballottaggio di ieri scheda bianca o nulla.
Quindi se si cercano i colpevoli di “alto tradimento ai principi del M5S”, ecco, uno l'avete trovato.
A causa delle funzioni da me svolte, ero posizionato in questi primi giorni d'aula in una posizione fisicamente distante dal gruppo 5 stelle...Salire sabato pomeriggio su quei banchi e restare tutto il tempo a guardare i volti dei miei colleghi senza poter scambiare una parola è stata una prova durissima, ma più duro è stato portare nel cuore i volti, le lacrime degli amici Siciliani e Calabresi (non solo loro) e leggere il messaggio di una persona che la mafia ha colpito più duramente di tanti altri. Così, di fronte al rischio di vedere nuovamente una persona come quella proposta dal PDL quale seconda carica dello Stato (non credo che i cittadini italiani meritino una cosa del genere...), pure con mille dubbi e consapevole che tra PD e PDL non esiste il “meno peggio”, ho votato Grasso, non potendo più votare per l'unico candidato al quale avrei affidato quell'incarico: Luis Alberto Orellana.
A volte seguire la propria coscienza porta a delle scelte ed io, liberamente, ho deciso di farne una. 
Mi rendo conto che questa mia posizione, pur non rappresentando in alcun modo un' apertura di credito a chicchessia (vostro diritto non credermi, ma credo che potrò agevolmente confermare con i fatti) e tanto meno, come fantasiosamente è stato detto e scritto una sorta di ""do ut des"" del M5S in vista delle elezioni di figure forse anche più rilevanti ai fini del Movimento (quali i Questori o i presidenti di Commissione), può creare danni al Movimento e dato che persone migliori e più preparate di me possono prendere il mio posto senza alcun problema, lunedì e martedì sarò a Roma per discutere l' opportunità delle mie dimissioni.
Alcune cose mi preme chiarire, comunque vadano le cose:

-NESSUNO mi ha fatto ""proposte"", ""offerte"" o tentato di ""comprare"" il mio voto. Nessuno, se non me stesso e la mia coscienza, è responsabile della mia scelta.

-Nel mio futuro, se non sarà tra i cittadini del M5S, non ci saranno ""gruppi misti"" o gruppi di altri colori. La parola su cui si deve decidere è dimissioni sì o no.

-A nessuno venga in mente che questo voto, riguardante ESCLUSIVAMENTE una figura di garanzia istituzionalmente prevista, possa automaticamente comportare una dichiarazione di fiducia al PD. Su quella la posizione è stata netta sin dal primo giorni: nessuna fiducia a nessuno se non a un Governo 5 Stelle!

-Quello che sto scrivendo non mi è stato imposto da NESSUNO, tanto meno da Beppe Grillo che ho sempre stimato, ma che come ogni cittadino, nella mia ottica conta sempre uno. Anche in questo, devo rispondere alla mia coscienza, come ho fatto nell'urna.

-Ho avuto il privilegio di vedere il gruppo del Senato da una posizione privilegiata, gli scranni della presidenza: vorrei ripetere a loro e a tutti quelli che leggeranno ciò che dissi nel pomeriggio del 15: siete bellissimi e non solo ""coreograficamente"". Difficilmente mi capiterà nella vita di avere il privilegio di collaborare, anche per pochi giorni, con persone così preparate e determinate. Difficilmente capiterà all'Italia. Al di là delle differenze caratteriali che (fortunatamente) ci contraddistinguono, sarete/saranno una squadra favolosa...

The problem is the housing shortage, local councils involved in selling of land at extreme prices, developers that were charging a fortune and banks selling high mortgages as if it was nothing. And people in rent-controlled houses that can afford to buy a house, but are staying put.

But I am getting sick of people blaming those that bought an apartment or house for getting handouts, whilst they themselves are in rent-controlled and additional subsidised housing being ""frugal"". 

I've seen couples without children living in family-sized rent-controlled homes with a garden and parking complaining about the hypotheekrenteaftrek. I can only afford an apartment with 1 bedroom and a small boxing room, without the hypotheekrenteaftrek that is nigh on impossible.

Which leaves me having to sell my apartment at a loss, having to move into a shitty rental, paying at a minimum of €1000 a month in rent (without amenities).

I would be frugal too if I had some money left over at the end of the month.  ",0,1363529668,null,0,false,0,c8x8fat,t3_1ag26c,t1_c8x8fat,t1_c8x83s6,null,1431613142,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Right up until a few hundred years ago most people lived on about the equivalent of £2,000 pa *in today's money terms*. They didn't have enough, or varied food. They died in droves. They didn't travel or take foreign holidays. They were cold. 

As a *result* of capitalism - well, trade and market activity to be exact - we in the West have seen a staggering rise in our wealth over the last 300 years, a rise unprecedented in history.

And it doesn't stop there.

&gt;*We've seen inequality rise and rise since the '70s*

In fact the number of people living in poverty has plummeted:

 * Defining poverty as less than $1/day, world poverty rates fell by 80% from 27% in 1970 to slightly more than 5% in 2006. 
 * The corresponding total number of poor fell from 403 million in 1970 to 152 million in 2006.
 * Similar findings apply if other poverty measures are used ($2/day, 5$/day, etc)

I have been a euro fanboy and EU federalist for a very long time, but such decisions with IMMEDIATE hits that threaten the entire eurozone's credibility make me want to see Cyprus default and quit the eurozone *while knowing that short term this will cause even more pain*. Why? because then this pain would have been inflicted to the country by itself, not imposed on it by someone else.

Make no mistake, this decision *is* disastrous for the entire eurozone.

Cyprus and arguably Ireland are the only countries where the population would be willing to dump the euro because their previous currencies enjoyed way more stable prices (ie. the euro has had more inflation in every day prices). In countries where they were buying candy in 100s+ of currency, the euro definitely did bring more of a sense of stability. The only true reason why countries are sticking to the euro is 'solidarity' etc... in the case of Cyprus, they just got *shafted* by the so-called ""solidarity"".

Leaving the euro will be very bad for any country that attempts it and it's probably a bad idea, but if we're gonna throw Cyprus under the bus, why not see what actually happens in such a scenario? :P

Lets face it, I think the eurogroup didn't expect/want Cyprus to actually accept this bailout, nor are they interested in fixing the economy (at least in the short-medium term. Clearly if you hit rock bottom there is only one way to go -&gt; up).

I respectfully disagree. These countries living on credit allowed the creditor countries to go into overproduction mode without facing any adverse consequences. In a sense, the debtor countries bought some time for the creditor countries and moved the economic crisis a few years in the future. 

&gt; Because constructive behavior will result in gentler conditions for a recovery, while destructive behavior will result in extremely harsh conditions. Tourism, for example, is a very important sector of many of those countries, and I doubt many Europeans will travel there in the future if these countries were beginning to act unsoundly.

Allow me to reverse your argument: I don't see how you can justify the destructive behaviour on the part of the creditor countries but are unable to do the same for the debtor countries. If Germany et al. can make unreasonable demands then it's fair game for Greece et al. to do the same.

The Nazis **adopted** it. It's not a ""Nazi Salute"". 

&gt;The salute gesture is widely believed to be based on an ancient Roman custom.  Jacques-Louis David's painting Oath of the Horatii (1784) seems to be the starting point for the gesture that became known as the Roman salute. The gesture and its identification with ancient Rome was advanced in other French neoclassic art. This was further elaborated upon in popular culture during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in plays and films that portrayed the salute as an ancient Roman custom.

However, as soon as you add money incentives to home purchasing, the buyers treat the house as an investment. The very direct effect is an increase in the housing prices, because due to incentives, the buyers can afford a higher monthly payment. In the end, instead of buying more house, you just pay more for the same house.

And this is not the entire story. In the US the profit you make from selling a house is not taxed up to $500k. A lot of people saw it as a way to make easy money. They flipped houses every 2 years, cashed $100k-$200k with no taxes and made a living out of it. Until the crash came, that is.

ce sont des propos très simplificateurs. On ne joue pas à superMario parce qu'on s'identifie à un plombier trapus, obèse et moustachu! La raison pour laquelle on ne crée pas le même jeu mais avec un scénario inverse [la princesse qui veut sauver son plombier] n'a rien de sexiste: c'est juste la volonté de ne pas créer deux licences conflictuelles sur une même tranche de marché. Si tu décides de sortir un équivalent féminin à Solid Snake de Metal Gear Solid, tu as un parcours du combattant à faire pour installer cette nouvelle licence. Le Capitalisme n'a rien à cirer du sexisme.

Il y a deux aspects dans ces jeux:

- le marketing, qui va mettre en avant les ""mega bimbo hypersexuée"", pour créer le buzz, et appâter l'acheteur. De la même manière qu'un distributeur de blockbustters va mettre en avant son héro cool, et sa partenaire sexy pour vendre des places. 

- le game design, la manière que tu joues le jeu. 

Une fois que tu passes la phase d'achat, tu te rends compte que les bonbons lâchés dans le trailer du jeu, ne se retrouvent pas dans le jeu. Dans le dernier Tomb Raider par exemple, la scène de la tentative de viol qui a buzzé, est totalement noyée dans une ambiance sordide, de meurtres, exécutions, dépeçages... Et les attributs de forces physique sont totalement logiques au vu qu'elle escalade des falaises, des tours...

La raison pour laquelle ce jeu est ridicule, est due au fait d'un scénario linéaire sans intérêt. Lara croft est au point A,  parle à qq, il lui dit d'aller au point B, Arrivée au point B, on passe à la mission suivante. et si elle meure on recommence 10 secondes en arrière!!

Il faut aller plus en profondeur dans le design de chaque jeu, regarder l’évolution du personnage, sa liberté d’entreprendre (ou pas) certaines certaines missions avant de juger si les attributs hyper-sexués sont au centre du jeu. On ne peut se contenter de juger que StreetFighter est sexiste, pour la simple raison que les attributs féminins sont mis en avant sur la pochette DVD, ou parce que l’éditeur attire le public sur son stand en ramenant des cosplays pulpeuses...",0,1363536877,null,0,1363542477,0,c8xa2lw,t3_1afife,t1_c8xa2lw,t1_c8x9acz,null,1431613908,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

However, the majority of money going towards this bailout comes from Russian (and British and whoever else) money launderers and tax evaders. To this extent its a unique, almost ingenius move (if it weren't for the obvious moral dilemma). The Eurozone and IMF have just bailed out a country using tax launderers money.

Consequently, this bailout is impossible in other nations because there aren't as many tax evaders there. Take Greece for example. A levy like this (seeking several billion €) would have to be paid almost exclusively by the Greek people. No tax evaders are putting their money in Greek banks. Greek tax laws aren't conducive to such actions. The same goes for Portugal, Spain, and Italy. The only countries that need worry about such policies are those that enjoy tax haven status.

In a way this policy in Cyprus isn't surprising. The EU has been targeting tax havens for a while now. [Read this from the Commission.] (http://ec.europa.eu/news/economy/121211_en.htm) Cyprus was a great opportunity to close one of those tax havens, as suggested [here.] (http://english.ruvr.ru/2013_03_15/Cyprus-may-scrap-tax-haven-status-to-get-EU-bailout/) What will become interesting is how far the EU pursues tax havens beyond this though.

Instead of raising your arm and doing it with your hand open and the fingers stretched, just do a thumbs up. It still feels natural and looks rather cool and not nazi at all.

OK now you need to provide some kind of evidence for that.

You are simply incorrect, show us evidence if you really believe this.

Not always - in fact they often can't be tracked. 

&gt;Yeah right, like last year when mtgox was hacked and the market crashed immediately.

Because markets denominated in USD never crash, right? Or companies holding USD never get their money stolen from them?

(1) What does the 'average' tax evader do with their money (average meaning normal people)? My bet is they don't consciously save it (i.e. the average Greek isn't flush with savings atm). Greece has an average gross of €1124pm vs. Cyprus at €1912pm [here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_in_Europe_by_monthly_average_wage). Cyprus also has lower tax rates, so Cypriot savings can be expected to be higher. A tax like this in Greece would therefore need to be massive in order to accrue anything worthwhile from the average Greek.

(2) What does the wealthy tax evader (politician, high level businessman) do with his money? I highly doubt that money is locked away in some Athenian bank account as these people will be far more financially sophisticated than that. [This article and revelation] (http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2012/oct/29/press-freedom-greece) claims at least €2bn is in Switzerland. A tax on Greek banks isn't touching that. Cyprus however, had all those rich people's money and plenty more from Russia. It, unlike Greece, is a tax haven. Maybe some Greek tax evading money is locked away in Cyprus?

Car pour certaines licences, attendre le bouche à oreilles c'est signer son arrêt de mort tellement leur produit est nul. L’éditeur EA games [cité par l'auteur] a une très mauvaise réputation à cause de cela: ses jeux vendus sont assez médiocres et sont écoulés à coup de campagnes marketing assez agressives. L'hyper sexualisation de Tomb Raider rentre dans une logique similaire: on met en avant les babes, car on arrivera à vendre bien moins de copies si on montrait le coté gore du jeu, qui au final est le caractère dominant de cette licence [au moins de ce que j'ai vu de la première version et de la dernière]",1,1363551878,null,0,false,0,c8xehsu,t3_1afife,t1_c8xehsu,t1_c8xdwyg,null,1431616165,-1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,-1

 Surfing is really popular here and we have some neat beaches around. But I must warn you, it rains quite often!

I’d recommend that you go with the flow and enjoy the local holidays/festivals… 

Some examples in San Sebastian: jazz festival in July, Semana Grande in August (a week of free concerts, firework contests etc), international film festival in September, international horror festival in October, tamborrada in January (THE day of san Sebastian, difficult to explain… it’s noisy and fun), carnival in Mars (the one from Tolosa, a nearby town, is a must see)…

Try to do some hiking too because there are some breathtaking landscapes in the Basque coast. 

Also, surrounding cities like Bilbao, Vitoria or Pamplona are really beautiful so make sure to check them out (Pamplona is where the bull runs of San Fermin take place in July). The French Basque country is gorgeous too.

And do not forget to check out the local cuisine, this small city is called the culinary capital of Europe after all ;oP. 

I really hope that you’ll enjoy your stay over here!

Yes and it's not like society fell apart in the UK when it was made illegal, it's just that it's the unnecessary removal of a parenting tool which is a valid, reasonable use of force to prevent a child from doing themselves or others harm.

&gt;You spend most of your time to teach your kids right from wrong. Then you as an adult are allowed to smack them?! Explain the logic here.

Because it's not wrong. A parent smacking their child to stop them from continually reaching to touch a hot stove or to stop them running across a busy road is doing nothing different than police restraining a suicidal or mentally ill person.

This idiotic idea that the use of force is always wrong needs to go. The *legal, moral* use of force underpins a lot of society, and force is *always* the final resort when reasoned debate or discussion can't function. As a result of kids of the sort of age where you'd smack them not being reasonable creatures, force is a parenting tool which is effective and fair enough. It does no physical damage and yes, it demonstrates to kids that ultimately the world comes down to the legitimate use of force.

Ca n'a rien à voir ni avec le contenu des jeux, ni avec les campagnes marketing.

en ce qui concerne le  ""Réagir aux contenus"". Je rappelle que les jeux prennent en compte des restriction d'ages, qui sont plus sévères que les films. Que les jeux scènes de viols et tout ca, sont réservés à un public sensé être plus mature, et comprendre que si on simule un mac dans GTA, ca ne donnent pas le droit d'aller draguer comme un pot de colle dans la rue.

true,Cartrodus,null,null,"&gt;wenn der geringe frauenanteil in den führungsebenen sexistisch begründet ist - und das möchte ich hier gar nicht ausschließen - dann bestärkt man mit solchen gesetzen diesen sexismus nur.

Den Zusammenhang musst du mir mal erklären. Gleichstellung stärkt Sexismus?

&gt;außerdem wo zieht man bei sowas die grenze? warum gibt es keine frauenquote bei den ganzen dreckigen und gefährlichen jobs?

Nun, vermutlich, weil eine Frau, so sie denn will und die entsprechenden Fähigkeiten zur Ausübung eines solchen Berufs hat, keine Probleme hätte, da ran zu kommen. Oder auch derselbe Grund, warum es bei traditionellen Frauenberufen keine Männerquote gibt. Bei Führungspositionen ist das wohl eher nicht der Fall, die Reaktion darauf kann man ja am Artikel im OP gut sehen.

Davon ab: Mir fallen jetzt spontan so einige Gründe dafür ein, warum Männer körperlich eher für solche Berufe geeignet sind, welche Gründe fallen dir dafür ein, dass Frauen nicht dazu imstande sein sollten, Führungspositionen zu übernehmen? Und wenn es da keine Gründe gibt, warum dominieren Männer die Führungsetagen? Vielleicht, weil sie die historisch bedingt dominieren und keinerlei Interesse daran haben, ihren intimen Männerclub zu öffnen?

&gt;jungefrauen wählen öffter studiengänge/ausbildungen die deutlich weniger erfolgsversprechend sind als junge männer - wie rechnen wir das in die frauenquote ein?

Mal dran gedacht, dass das vielleicht daran liegen könnte, dass man als Frau in von Männern dominierten Bereichen mit großen Widerständen rechnet? Und mal dran gedacht, dass typische Frauenberufe ""deutlich weniger erfolgsversprechend"" sein könnten, eben weil es Frauenberufe sind? Sexismus war jahrhundertelang dominant, du kannst doch nicht davon ausgehen, dass sich dessen Auswirkungen einfach verflüchtigt haben, nur weil es inzwischen ein paar Jahrzehnte Frauenbewegung gab?

Weiterhin könnte man natürlich auch noch jede Menge Überlegungen dazu anstellen, inwiefern die unterschiedlichen Präferenzen bei Berufsfeldern auf gesellschaftliche Prägungen und Rollenerwartungen zurückzuführen sind und ob die Frauenquote ein geeignetes Instrument wäre, um da entgegenzuwirken.

&gt;aber man kann nicht erwarten dass sich innerhalb von 20-30 jahren solche strukturen aufbrechen

Und genau da setzt die Frauenquote an, indem sie die Strukturen aufbricht?

&gt;Frauen müssen und sollten nicht an die hand genommen werden wie ein kleines kind.

Darum geht es bei der Frauenquote nicht wirklich. Es geht darum, die von dir bereits erwähnten etablierten Strukturen aufzubrechen, die dafür sorgen, dass Frauen es derzeit schwerer haben, überhaupt in diese Positionen zu kommen. Lies doch mal den Artikel. Der ganze Aufriss, weil Daimler bis 2020 20%(!) Frauen in der Führungsebene haben will. Wenn das kein Indiz dafür ist, *wie* schwer Frauen es haben, in Führungspositionen aufzusteigen, was dann? Das impliziert, dass es derzeit deutlich weniger als 20% sind, und trotzdem fühlt man sich bereits jetzt bedroht und übergangen?

&gt;und das obwohl junge männer immer seltener das abitur abschließen und noch seltener einen hochschulabschluss absolvieren. wie passt das zusammen? der teil der bevölkerung der offensichlich in der ausbildung deutliche größere probleme hat wird deutlich weniger gefördert.

Ist sicherlich auch ein Problem, hat aber mit dem, worum es im Artikel geht, eher am Rande zu tun. Dass Frauen inzwischen im Durchschnitt besser ausgebildet sind und trotzdem in den Führungsetagen unterrepräsentiert sind ist ja sogar eher ein Indiz dafür, dass es da immernoch arge Probleme gibt?

Ich persönlich bin mir ja auch unschlüssig darüber, ob positive Diskriminierung wirklich ein brauchbares Instrument ist, um Gleichberechtigung zu erreichen, aber deine Argumente dagegen finde ich eher wenig überzeugend. Insgesamt wirkst du so, als ob du dich mit der Thematik nicht besonders auseinandergesetzt hast und es einfach nur unschön findest, dass du als Mann negativ betroffen bist und deswegen aus Prinzip dagegen bist. Die Quote ist sicherlich kein perfektes Instrument und hat ihre Nachteile, aber offensichtlich passiert ohne sie bzw. die Androhung ihrer Einführung ja auch herzlich wenig. Schwierige Thematik, der man mit Aussagen à la ""ich glaube die sinnfreiheit der frauenquote sollte inzwischen bei jedem angekommen sein"" nicht wirklich gerecht wird, finde ich.",0,1363555878,null,0,false,0,c8xfp8e,t3_1agw4f,t1_c8xfp8e,t1_c8xazs1,null,1431616629,6,false,de,t5_22i0,6

You will definitively be able to take the bus, there are connexions to and from everywhere. You can find any infos about the bus system in Aix on [Aix en Bus](http://aixenbus.fr/). Also, [Le Pilote](http://www.lepilote.com) will be very helpful for all bus rides in the department. I have a yearly card so I don't know the prices but I'm sure there's some kind of monthly subscription that may or may not be cheaper than just buying tickets.

Protip: when you want to go to Marseille, if you're under 25, get yourself a bus card from car treize (the bus company that ride that route) at the gare routière, and buy some day tickets. Day tickets are only like 2€ and that's an illimited day of travelling on the whole car 13 network, so you can actually go to Aubagne, Arles, etc. That's pretty cheap compared to a ""normal"" one-way ticket Aix - Marseille, which is around 5€. 

Public transport in Aix is messy at times. Since last July they've been making changes to the schedules every two months or so. They're going to make another change tomorrow! x.X The ""gare routière"" (main bus station thingy?) has been under construction for the past six months and it doesn't look like it'll be done when you'll be around. 

If your classes are Rue du Bon Pasteur, I think I know which institute you'll be travelling with, although the name has completely escaped my mind right now. You may want to look for a flat around the Sextius area - it'll be expensive, but it will be next door to your classes and pretty close to the main ""partying"" area, mainly the Rue de la Verrerie; people will tell you to go there and to a pub called the Woohoo, but if you're not into binge drinking on overpriced shots you'll definitively want to look somewhere else. Obviously, it all boils down to what kind of stay you want to have here ;)

Also, before I forget - there's a bookstore called [Book'in'Bar](http://www.bookinbar.com/), they sell books in English (as well as in other languages) and a lot of English-speaking folks go there. They also serve hot drinks and snacks and it's my favourite place in the city ~~when I want to pretend I can handle human interaction~~ when I want to have tea.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;If you need to smack your kid to do as you say you should perhaps think about how you are as a parent.

Ah the old ""everyone can be reasoned with"" so I'm a better parent than you argument - nice and condescending that. Never heard that before....you must have amazingly well behaved toddlers in Sweden.

&gt;Is a good example of how you probably view your kids.

Children exist in a level of fairly low development for the first 5 years. It's only at around the 20-24 month stage that they become capable of understanding that there's a separation between them as an entity and the rest of the universe. I mean, we're talking really low functioning here. That's not a criticism, it's a reality.

&gt;It is actually perfectly possible to reason with a say 2 year old (depending on the maturity).

Sometimes it's possible to convince them, but 2 year olds are fundamentally unreasonable creatures, like cats, or some mentally ill people.

&gt;They will understand that a hot stove is dangerous.

They might, or they might not. If you're in the middle of cooking dinner and your child keeps reaching for the stove saying ""&lt;name&gt;, stop that at once"" or ""&lt;name&gt; don't touch the stove, it's hot and you'll hurt yourself!"" may or may not work. If it doesn't work and you need to stop your child from reaching for that stove immediately, smacking is a pretty effective technique at stopping most kids dead in their tracks.

&gt;Then if they would touch it, they would touch it and get a blister.

Or maybe they lose a finger, or maybe they walk over that road I mentioned earlier and get run over. Kids without adults are remarkably good at damaging themselves. I still have a scar from where I pulled a glass fruit bowl onto my head as a very young kid because I was curious what was in it, thankfully I lowered my head as it came onto me, otherwise instead of having cuts on the back of my head I could be blind today.

&gt;What is the hitting accomplishing here? 

Smacking stops a child doing whatever it's doing instantly. In a way which shouting or discussing often just won't.

&gt;First they learn a lesson, then you hit them.

Don't follow what you mean by this. Kids aren't learning lessons when you prevent them from getting themselves hurt or killed, they're just being prevented from being hurt or killed. If in that process they learn that dominant authority has the justified right to the use of force as a last resort then they're learning a very accurate life lesson.

Also I suspect that several countries which hate the euro will likely help Cyprus with the process.

Who and for why? 

* US does have the money, but EU is not competitor to them, they are a strategical partner against China in the 21st century. 
* UK does have some money, but Tories would make political suicide giving outside the country. 
* Russia has money, but they want something in return of it, not to mention that it is in the interest of upper Russian elite to drive back money that it is now in foreign tax shelters. 
* China has money, but they definitely want it back with interest.

Not to mention that monetizing those gas/oil fields will take years, you just can't move faster with that kind of projects. So that won't help at all.

&gt; b) Cyprus starts a chain reaction with nations starting to leave the eurozone, eventually leaving the alleged 'northern' eurozone countries in a bit of a mess.

Or not. Bank runs in Cyprus will probably lead savers with sizable deposits in troubled Euro countries to transfer them to for example German banks or invest into assets.

Define market support. If the external value of Euro goes a little bit down because of this it has only helped Eurozone exporters. If it is just media that is aloud against it, then it doesn't count. The only thing could change things is if there would be bank runs in Spain or Italy, but I wouldn't count on that.

You're right, except this is a key foundation of the EU. Nations don't implement things for 'Europe's benefit'. National governments delegate power when they think its in their best interest to. The financial crisis is the best example ever of a case where nations do not think it is in their best interest to delegate. Germany will only change from Plan 'A' to Plan 'B' when Plan 'A' becomes worse for Germany. Cyprus is only in this position because it has no other choice.

The classic example is CAP. Its practically established fact that we should reform it further, but France, knowing that it would be bad for France, doesn't allow it. Same goes for quitting Strasbourg. We all want it, except France, who (and I agree with them), veto it because it would be bad for France.

The UK is a prime example of this. FTT was rejected because its bad for London. Fuck Europe's opinion. Bonus limits for bankers is opposed, why, bad for London.

Explique-nous quels sont le contexte et l'usage dans ce cas précis ?

Ça me fait penser à une anecdote : j'étais avec en mission chez un client avec un collègue arabe. Tous les jours, un gars du client qui travaillait avec nous passait nous dire bonjour, et tous les jours il faisait un blague sur le fait que mon collègue était arabe. Rien d'agressif, mais rien de vraiment drôle non plus. Mon collègue a tenté de lui faire comprendre que tous les jours, c'était lourd. Je lui ai dit que s'il faisait tous les jours une réflexion sur le fait qu'il était arabe, c'est qu'il avait un problème avec ça. Sa réponse : ""Je suis pas raciste : je suis de gauche ! Et puis c'est du second degré : je fais de l'humour avec ça, c'est bien la preuve que je suis pas raciste !""

Pour moi, faire une blague sur les arabes 1 fois par an : OK ce n'est pas être raciste. Il en fait tous les jours : c'est être raciste. Nous sommes ce que nous faisons, pas ce que nous prétendons faire.

Mais impossible de lui faire comprendre ça.

Si un milieu fait systématiquement des blagues misogynes, comme celui dont on parle, c'est qu'il est misogyne. Et que c'est lourd. Et personnellement, parfois ça me gave. Après cette histoire de contexte, à mes yeux, c'est une excuse dont tu te sers pour ne pas voir le problème.

&gt;The SNP has previously recognised the islands' right to decide their own future but has since changed its mind, with oil revenues vital to its economic case for separation.

&gt;Speaking after sending his letter, Mr Scott said: “This week the genie flew out of the nationalist bottle. The SNP doesn’t believe in people determining their future unless it’s on their own nationalist terms.

&gt;A spokesman for the First Minister [Salmond] said: “Shetland is a valued part of Scotland and will remain so.

Shetland has largely been pro-Union. So shouldn't they get a choice too if the SNP are pro self-determination? Which could mean Scotland goes independent but Shetland stays in the UK. Or that Scotland and Shetland go independent respectively. Except that without Shetland, Scotland has considerably less oil, which really fucks the SNP's plans.

[A second article related to this has this direct quote:] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9794268/SNP-warned-off-outrageous-Shetland-oil-grab.html)

&gt;la cessione dei diritti d' autore e' piuttosto normale, altrimenti dovrebbero pagarti delle royalties ogni volta che utilizzano un tuo lavoro. Sarebbe difficile fare anche solo un sito internet: dovrebbero tenere traccia dei diritti d'autore di ogni singolo contributo (il jpg fatto da tizio, il testo scritto da caio, ecc...) e far partire un sacco di scartoffie amministrative per far partire i compensi e le richieste di autorizzazione ad ogni collaboratore che ha contribuoto; onestamente sono sorpreso dal fatto che tu prima lavorassi diversamente.

Non è che prima lavorassi diversamente, è che questo è il mio primo lavoro non in nero: per questo sono ancora confuso su quali siano le modalità più comuni per lavorare ""seriamente"".

&gt;in pratica tu saresti un loro collaboratore esterno, se accetti diventi un libero professionista e dovrai cercare del lavoro su commessa. in molti lavorano cosi', puo' fare al caso tuo o meno, ma sappi che (legge fornero) i collaboratori esterni non possono avere solo un cliente e non possono avere una postazione fissa dal cliente (si', perche' a quel punto l'azienda non sarebbe il tuo datore di lavoro, ma il tuo cliente).

Come posso avere altre collaborazioni se per il fisco non esisto? Non ho partita IVA, questo vuol dire che dovrei cercarmi ulteriori rapporti di lavoro basati su questo modello di contratto? La cessione dei diritti?

&gt;il punto e' che non credo che il tuo lavoro sia considerato ""strategico"" per la loro attivita' e quindi per loro il collaboratore ideale (che immagino stiano cercando) e' quello che fa bene il suo lavoro senza far perdere loro tempo.

Non è strategico: non sono niente più di un semplice operaio in questo contesto. Ma anche al più basso degli operai si fa un minimo di formazione per fargli capire almeno ""che deve fare"". Il fatto che questi si siano accontentati di un semplice colloquio per decidere di assumermi mi fa riflettere: o ho uno charme incommensurabile (lol), o cercano un pirla da sfruttare.

Aber es scheint mir, als ob Dronen bei Kritikern aktuell einen Sonderstatus als inhumane ""Monsterwaffe"" haben. Ich bin kein Militärexperte, kann das aber nicht nachvollziehen. Beispielhaftes Zitat aus dem Artikel:

&gt; So befürchtet der katholische Militärbischof Franz-Josef Overbeck, ""dass die Hemmschwelle, Gewalt einzusetzen, durch den Krieg am Computer sinkt. Drohnen dürfen keine Hinrichtungsinstrumente sein.""

Wurde diese Hemmschwelle nicht schon vor langer Zeit überschritten? Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass es in der Geschichte ähnliche Ansichten gab, als Artillerie, Bomber, ja sogar Schusswaffen jeweils ihren ersten Einsatz fanden. Quasi als ""unfaire/unpersönliche"" Methoden im Gegensatz zum guten alten, ""ehrenhaften"" Zweikampf mit Keule/Schwert/etc. Was ist rein technisch und in Bezug auf die Psyche der Drohnenbediener anders als bei der Bedienung von anderen modernen Waffensystemen, bei der man ebenfalls diese Distanz zum Ziel hat?

&gt; Außerdem könne es im Drohnenkrieg sehr schwierig sein, zwischen Kämpfenden und Unbeteiligten zu unterscheiden, ""Unschuldige dürfen aber auf keinen Fall getötet werden.""

Siehe oben. Ist das begründet? Inwiefern ist das Riksiko von zivilen Opfern (also die Gefahr, potentielle Ziele nicht voneinander unterscheiden zu können) bei Drohnen-""Piloten"" größer als bspw. bei Waffensystemoffizieren in Kampfflugzeugen?

1. La cause réelle des comportements misogynes (peur de la féminité et obligation de virilité).

Die Drohne als Waffe ist nur einen Schritt weiter, der Pilot kann theoretisch am anderen Ende der Welt sein. Woran sich jedoch viele schwer tun ist dass in der Theorie die Möglichkeit besteht Steuerung, Zielauffassung und Zielbekämpfung vollständig zu automatisieren. Die nächste Generation der US-Kampfdrohnen soll das bereits in Ansätzen können bzw es wird daran gearbeitet. Der Entschluss zur Zielbekämpfung könnte also theoretisch durch eine Software abgewägt werden, was im Prinzip automatisierter Kriegsführung entspricht.

Die Argumentation mit Hemmschwelle ist natürlich kompletter Dünnsinn. Unsere Artillerie schießt im Einsatz lieber einmal zu wenig als zu oft, und die sitzen im Prinzip auch nur vor einem großen Computer in ihrer Haubitze.

I see your point, but unfortunately this is wrong. The EU has and always will have disparity in tax. We've known this since the EU's inception, and since countries like Cyprus joined. The USA has Delaware as a tax haven and they are a full union.

Some sort of Euro wide tax rate would never be accepted by Member States (let alone actually work given the economic disparity between Member States).

Also, I do find myself agreeing with radaway when he suggests that some expansion of the money supply would actually be beneficial for us now - on the short run, he's absolutely right, and on the long run, by then we'll be in a better position to deal with the inflation than the situation where we're now with little to defend ourselves against the massive taxes.

&gt;Backed into a corner, the only thing the Cypriots could do was mitigate the damage. Several officials suggested putting all of the burden on deposits over €100,000. Berlin was agnostic about where the axe fell. But Cypriot officials, with the backing of the commission, felt anything over 10 per cent would appear so onerous that it would make the situation even worse.  
“The Cypriot president did not want to agree to a levy higher than 10 per cent,” said one top negotiator. “People were joking that he has only rich friends.”  
Once that limit was placed on the top rate, it became simple maths. Negotiators agreed to count €1.4bn in privatisation receipts and new income from an increased corporate tax – which would go from 10 to 12.5 per cent – towards the Cypriot contribution, bringing the total needed from the deposits to €5.8bn. With a top rate of 9.9 per cent, the lower rate fell in at 6.75 per cent.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Treaties don't mean anything. They are just fanciful guidelines. Every country in the EU acts in its own interests, because there is no higher authority to keep them in check.

You are wrong there- treaties are the law. That countries then *chooses* to ignore them, are breaking the law. Just because the countries that breaks it, do not get invaded, doesn't mean they are  not assholes, nor do they mean that they are doing the right thing. It is like if Finland would start torturing their prisoners. Since Finland have signed all kinds of human right treaties, plus it is forbidden in the EU, they are breaking the law. That they might not get punished because of it, doesn't change that fact. 

Also, it says a lot that you do not see it as corruption just because it is on EU -level. Doesn't make it less corrupt, it makes it more corrupt. 

&gt;The banks collapsing would be disastrous for not just their country, not even just Europe, but the whole world. If Sweden contributes to the bailout funds its because it benefits Sweden. Do you think the politicians are traitors or something?

I didn't say that no banks should be saved, but are you claiming that every single bank should be? Also, if you want to do a bank save, do a proper one, that benefits the people. Take a look at the Swedish and Finnish bank saves of the 90's, who are generally seen as model ones. We saved the banks, but the banks *know* that they will pay dearly to be saved - namely to give up ownership. And, in the end the Swedish government even *made* money from it. However, the Eurozone bank save is the opposite of that - the banks have been saved, again and again, and nothing has been taken from them. Basically, they have managed to become risk free- take whatever risk they want, get bailed out at no costs. And you are saying that is not corrupt? Just because it is done on an EU level, doesn't make it less corrupt? It is just tax payers being fucked on a greater scale.[Link to Swedish bank save](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_banking_rescue). 


&gt;If Sweden contributes to the bailout funds its because it benefits Sweden. 

We haven't. Contributed to Ireland, after that our politicians have wisely stayed out of it, and rightfully critiscised it, for being a really bad save. However, we can't stop the money from the CAP for example being misused however hard we try. 

No, I do not consider our politicians or the government Reinfeldt traitors. In fact, I think a lot of countries in the EU could learn from the fact that they are obsessive about balancing the budget, think pauing off debt is a good thing, and the fact that they are not in the pocket of banks all the time. Don't you think it would be good? Why do not more countries think like that?  


&gt;The Nordic countries have in total 25 million people. That is half the population of Spain. A Swedish company would probably rather be a single market with North Rhine-Westphalia than with Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland.

We could still have access to the market, like Norway. Also, we would have to stop to pay for corruption, or sponsor idiotic ideas, like CAP. And, the EU would loose income to. As it is now, they have 9 net payers, three would disappear.

Are you honestly this ignorant? So, for example, if Sweden decides, agaonst treaties, to start building nuclear weapons it is not a problem? It not a problem if we start torturing, or throwing pesticides in the Baltics? Treaties are there for a reason, and saying it is OK it so stupid. Are you saying for example that there would be no problem if everyone broke the treatis on fishing? I can tell you what would happen - fishes would be extinct at an even faster rate. Don't you think that is a problem? 

Second - why the hell do you think got the Eurozone in this mess? Do you honestly think it would be this bad (it would still be bad, due to the construction of the Euro, but that is a whole different issue) if everyone had followed the treaties? Greece wouldn't even be in the Eurozone, billions would have been saved and *many of the countries in the Eurozone would not be in a recession, had treaties been followed*. So, the costs are over trillions, and the problems are to many to count. So yes, it is an enormous problem, at costs to high to calculate, not to mention the human tragedies in it wake.

&gt;Although I suppose not every country has broken the treaties. Sweden perhaps is one of those. Has Sweden brought up the issue at the European level?

No we have not. Nor have Finland or Estonia. 



&gt;It's only a problem if one party decides to ignore the treaty. If every party decides to forget about the treaty (the bailouts) then what is the problem?


And, by following the rules .- it is a huge problem for me that my food is poisened by the French and Italians, among others, that overuse pesticide. It is a huge problem for me that the bees are dying. It is a huge problem, that due to the extremely incompetent save we do not have a working financial market. As it is now, the banks can do any move they want, without taking any risks, because all of them, will always be bailed out, at no costs. You do not have to have studied a lot to understand that it imbalances the whole market. If there are no risks, the banks do not have to act or hedge against it. Of course there *are* risks, but instead of the owners carrying the costs, the tax payers are now doing it -that is the wet dream of any banker. I can sit and list problems with not following the rules all day, which have *direct* consequences for me.



&gt;I'm not an economist, so I'm not going to judge. Are you an economist?

No, three semesters of it before I got bored, but  I can also read, as can you, and you can read about the Swedish bank save - it was decided a ""good save"". Please, go ahead, search, google it. Then compare it to the Eurozone one. You seem intelligent enough, read a bit about it. 

I honestly can not believe that you mean that is not a problem when  countries follow treaties. It strikes me as so ignorant that I am stunned. Please say you didn't mean it as it sounded, because then I give up, your a idiot if you mean that.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;What I mean is that no country has been betrayed by another's disregard of the treaties. Germany, Britain, France, Holland, Sweden, Finland could have pressured Greece to reform before their situation spiralled out of control.

No, we could not. We are nine million people, and yes, it is a betrayal. How in God's name can you say that a breaking of a treaty is not a betrayal. If Sweden start  building nuclear arms, wouldn't it be a betrayal, since we have signed treaties not to do it.  It is a betrayal, if for example Sweden follow the fishing quotas laid out by the EU, but Denmark doesn't. Then we get hurt in the process. Same thing, if one country decides to overuse pesticed, and doesn't get punished for it - first the farmers get an unfair advantage, second, I get poisend by them.


**Breaking a treaty is betrayal**. Period, over and out. Just because more countries are doing it, doesn't make it less so, or less corrupt. Because that is what it is  -corruption. And, that is also what level the corruption has reached- the highest. So, the EU is corrupt as fuck.
And, countries are *supposed* to follow treaties, and you are not an accomplice, if you are unable to stop it. They are responsible, not us. 


&gt;In fact, the whole reason the Northern countries are so eager not to let Greece collapse is because Greek debt is owned by Northern banks.

German banks, please, not northern. Swedish banks have a minimum exposure to it. And, a much smarter move would have been to save system important banks, both in Germany and Greece, let the rest collapse. They would have learned a lesson too. 


&gt;The ECB will oversee most of Europe's banks and make sure they do not put themselves in such risk again.

Oh, they are, are they? I'll believe that when I see it.

You yourself are saying :

"" And yes, there is not enough risk, but the ECB is taking measures to fix this. ""

No, they are not. If they really wanted to fix it, they would have taken ownership. Then you hit banks where it matters, they loose ownership.  The Eurozone has willingly chosen a bad bank save, because they are in the pocket of bankers. 


I am glad that you at least agree to the fact that treaties are to be followed, but you have to agree with me that the EU is corrupt as fuck, the most important treaties there are, are not being followed. Also, you seem to be Scandinavian judging by your name, I don't understand how you can defend the behaviour of the EU.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;But as you said before, Sweden is not contributing to the bailouts, so the Eurozone crisis is not hurting Sweden. 

Excuse me, are you saying the recession isn't hurting Sweden? It is hurting the whole world. 

 Plus, **25** of EU:s countries, everybody apart from DK and UK have promised to follow the budget rules, that also includes us. The budget rules, as in 60% GDP, 3 % deficit etc. And, the fact that almost no one has, is hurting the whole of the EU, not just the Eurozone. So, yes, we have every right to feel hurt and betrayed. Why is no one following the rules, and why is not one being punished for it? The fact that the EU does not give one shit about the rules, tells me a lot. Also, the Finns are feeling rather betrayed, they are not exactly happy about the bailouts. 

&gt;As if the EU disappeared, corruption would melt away, the banks would recover, and we'd have full employment. This is not the case.

Where have I said that?  I *correctly*, I might add, blame the EU for not making sure that the treaties they have are not enforced, and the rules that they have are not followed, and that they are not fighting corruption enough. I also blame them for not fighting for the environment enough, and discriminating Swedish farmers.  Are you saying that it is incorrect of me to blame the EU for that? We have just discussed that the EU have *not* done all the things that I pointed out, so I am right. That is a good enough reason for me to blame the EU, and dislike them.


&gt;Obviously we Europeans must combat this corruption, so every country in Europe is less corrupt than even Sweden. 

Well, it is not being done. For example, look at the current bank bail outs? Oh, have we stopped handing over CAP money to countries that do not obey, or use to much perticides? 

I mean, all I see from your side is nice words - fight corruption, blablabla. But, is it actually being done? I have for example, yet to wait for a single country paying fines for breaking the Maastrich treaty, or just cutting the CAP to France for they are not following the pesticide rules. 

So, prove to me that the corruption is sinking, and that things are being done. Give me the countries that are fined or thrown out for not following the rules. 



&gt; I defend the EU,

This? [Link](http://euobserver.com/justice/119300?) 

How can you defend the betrayal of CAP, of pesticides, of fishing, of cutting the research, etc? 


&gt;This can be done without destroying the European Project.

No, the EU is destroying the European Project. I used to be a bit more like you, but after actually reading up on corruption, the Eurozone crises, and reading a lot about the CAP, I have learned to dislike the EU. 

If the EU wanted to save the European Project, why not act like it? Start with a proper bank save, and following the rules perhaps, cutting the CAP for France for example.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Excuse me, are you saying the recession isn't hurting Sweden? It is hurting the whole world.

Well, yes, but not directly. That's the nature of the globalized world. America set the whole thing off, did they betray us too? The southern crisis is not hurting Sweden *within the context of the Union*.

&gt;Where have I said that?

I didn't mean you have said that. I was just explaining why I defend the EU. I responded to you originally because you used the term ""EU"" to refer to all of Europe's politics which I believe is harmful to the European Project because it causes some people to wrongly conflate the member states' problems with the European institutions.

&gt;So, prove to me that the corruption is sinking, and that things are being done.

I don't believe the corruption is sinking. I believe it has constantly in the years leading up to the crisis, and now I believe that it is blowing up. What we have now, this crisis, is the culmination of years of corruption. And this crisis is forcing us to address the structural problems in Europe. Corruption depends on structural vulnerabilities so fixing these problems will have a positive affect on the reduction of corruption.

&gt;This? Link

&gt;How can you defend the betrayal of CAP, of pesticides, of fishing, of cutting the research, etc?

Because, as I have said, these problems are not with the European Project but with the member states. If you adopt a *European* mindset, then this corruption is inconsequential to the goal of European Unity. If you adopt a Swedish (or any other more responsible country) mindset, then obviously you do not want to be dragged down by this corruption. This is perfectly reasonable, and I respect this. It's a question of perspective in the end. What is our vantage point?

&gt;If the EU wanted to save the European Project, why not act like it? Start with a proper bank save, and following the rules perhaps, cutting the CAP for France for example. Both you and I know that is never going to happen, which tells us all we need to know about the EU.

Oh, there are many in the European political scene who would *love* to do this. One could argue that it is a *lack* of fervor for the European Project that causes these problems. In the end, it is the nation states that control the EU, and they answer to national interests, not European interests. For instance, what is the problem with CAP? It unfairly serves some countries. If you adopt a European mindset, this is silly, because you care for all of Europe equally. If you however adopt a French mindset, then it makes perfect sense to act in your self-interest by hijacking the CAP.",0,1363605728,null,0,false,0,c8xr4uh,t3_1ah9c4,t1_c8xr4uh,t1_c8xr0cr,null,1431622110,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"You are skillfully avoiuding to answer the fact that 25 states are supposed to follow the rules, but only three have consistently done that (Sweden, Finland and Estonia). I do notice when you don't answer, so please, don't use that tactic.

So, it is up to the EU to make sure that the rules are being followed, fines are being paid for example. Why are they not? The fact that they are not is a prime example of corruption on the highest level. Why aren't the EU acting? 


&gt;And this crisis is forcing us to address the structural problems in Europe. Corruption depends on structural vulnerabilities so fixing these problems will have a positive affect on the reduction of corruption.

Still, not saying *how* it is fixed, no links, nothing. You can also ponder over this, that in Italy, someone who did attempt to correct the deep structural issues got voted away. So, no, things are getting worse. 


&gt;Because, as I have said, these problems are not with the European Project but with the member states

No, it is with both. Sweden pay money to the EU, and they are supposed to divide those money among the member states, according to *the rules*, that we have all signed. If the rules are not being followed, **it is up to the EU to deal with that**. What you are saying/have been saying, is that Sweden should complain every time our money is not being used properly etc. That is madness. Are yo saying that each of the 27 states should follow each krona/pound/Euro that they pay in, track it, and evaluate it. The double, triple, twentyseven work this would lead to is ridiculous, and it is not feasible. So, instead the *EU* takes on that role. And, since they have, they should do it, and do it well. 

However, they are not. That means that you are wrong saying it is only with the states that the problem lies. The problem lies with the European Union.  The European Union should react, but they are not. Or are you saying that Sweden should track every krona, UK every pound, Poland every zloty? That would be madness. 

So, instead of acting, the **EU** is doing nothing, being corrupt, ignoring what is happening with our money, ignoring breaking the rules. That is a EU problem, and I am right complaining about that. It is also becoming worse. And, if the EU cared about the European Project as you said, they would deal with it. However, as both you and I know, they are not. So, sorry, you are wrong there. 

&gt;&gt;If you adopt a European mindset, then this corruption is inconsequential to the goal of European Unity. 

That sentence means nothing. It is against any countries, union, federation, commune, family, tribe etc goal to be corrupt, yet they are. The question is - are you acting against it?

&gt;Oh, there are many in the European political scene who would love to do this.

So, you are admitting to the fact that it is not happening, nor is it ever going to happen. You seem to be writing from what you want the European Union to be, not where it is actually at. Dreaming is fine, but they are not real arguments you know? 


&gt; If you adopt a European mindset, this is silly, because you care for all of Europe equally. 

Seriously, this is just daydreaming. I could just as well argue that if I adopted a world citizen point of view, it would be silly to just think of Europe. You see, I care for all of the world  - equally.......

You do not seem to be rooted in reality.

Here's what doesn't add up:

The mission is to save the banking system (which can use some downsizing, fair enough).

a) No bailout -&gt; banks are fucked

b) Deposit levy -&gt; banks are fucked a week or two later anyway (basically whoever doesn't draw out their money fast enough is gonna lose it anyway). This renders the bailout useless -- just agreeing to this will guarantee that the portion of the 10 billion euro loan that comes out of your taxpayers money is lost anyway.

I don't really know what the mindset of the countries who insisted on this is like, but it was pretty obvious to me that Cypriots and probably other southerners are gonna draw their money out as soon as possible.

To put it in simpler words: In order to save 5 billion euros (which comes out to a very small amount of money when divided by all contributors -- relative to country-sized economics), they may have just created a situation which will cost several 10s/100s of billions to the entire eurozone.",0,1363607298,null,0,1363608135,0,c8xrblq,t3_1aijsd,t1_c8xrblq,t1_c8xr3t6,null,1431622199,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

If Russian gas were to suddenly become an unreliable source, the EU (collectively) would just have to find someone else to give their money to, which would be bad news for Russia.

The problem here is *lag time* between the gas being switched off and finding another supplier. Russia is close. The gas is cheap. Turning it off would *hurt*, as our reserves only cover a few days, and no large scale suplier could be found at short notice. And if you don't think they would do it, then I urge you to look at both the history of what Russia has already done in regards to its gas, as well as what the Arabs did with their oil in the 1970s, and its consequences.

As a Dutch person I'm starting to lose hope for the eurozone and by extension the E.U. Nobody seems to be actually trying to solidify Europe into one entity, all everybody is doing is taking care of themselves. The Germans, Dutch, Finnish and Brits in particular seem to be using the trouble in Southern Europe (even if much of it is their own fault) to extend their economic power entirely at the expense of an entire generation in Spain, Portugal and Greece (more to come surely). If anyone was really trying this crisis would have been over years ago, a combination of haircuts and quantitative easing would made for an acceptable amount of inflation to keep everybody solvent. Instead the euro has proved to be nothing but an imposed gold standard in favor of the stronger northern economies.

For as far as I care the whole thing might as well implode.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"I personally think the Euro as a currency is wrongly constructed (and a lot of countries should be better of if they left) but that is perhaps a side issue. 

No, I do not think most of the cypriotic banks should be saved, at least not in the manners they are. Every bank save since the beginning of the crises have been rather idiotic, instead of saving ""system important"" banks letting some fail, and demanding collateral for saving the banks, they have just handed over money, without collateral, essentially making it risk free for the owners. 

Now they are making the people with the money in the banks pay, which I also find idiotic (I say go for the owners) but at least somewhat less idiotic, because I can understand some of the reasoning behind it. I can see that handing over tax payers money to save what is to a large degree shady money will not go down well in Germany. Also, I might have misunderstood it, but didn't they tell the Cypriotic government that they needed to raise money, but not how? 


&gt;So let me get this straight: you support the deposit levy precedent which could potentially be used against you in the future?

I don't think so, Sweden are not in that banking union. We have refused, among other things that we refuse to stand as a guarantee for 500 million inhabitants, plus that the bank saves never demanded anything back, the rules are to fuzzy etc (a lot of reasons) Also, we have had bank saves, and a good one to, not asking for any money from anyone else. I recommend you read about it, it is generally seen as a ""good save"". What is more important, the Swedish government did demand a lot of collateral for saving the banks (unlike the Eurozone save) which means while they know that they will receive help, it will cost them a lot. In the end that actually made money for the tax payers too. Can you say the same about this, or the rest of the Eurozone bank saves?

You say that the EU ought to punish, ought to fine, ought to keep the countries in line. But what can it do? What power the EU has is granted to it by the member states. They are the sovereign entities after all.

Of course, as you say, it is no good for every member state to chase down every euro the EU spends. So they leave the spending to the EU. *But it is still their money!* If Britain, if Sweden, if Germany, if all these richer countries are so worried about where their money is going surely they would hold the EU to account? The European Council meets regularly: a meeting of the 27 heads of states, Van Rompuy, and Barroso. Surely if there is such an issue of inefficient spending and corruption in the EU, these heads of states would demand action! They could draw up new legislation to fight corruption.

But they don't!

So perhaps the rest of these countries are simply not in tune with Sweden. Perhaps Sweden isn't getting the best out of this Union. If that is the case, Sweden ought to act rationally in its own self-interest and leave! But Sweden doesn't leave. The major parties do not feel the EU is bad for Sweden. They don't want an EU exit. So if these people in the Riksdag do know what is best for Sweden, and that is staying in the EU, what is ultimately wrong with the EU? It seems that in wishing to leave the EU you are in disagreement with all of these people. So what then? Are they incompetent, or are they traitors to the Swedish nation? If you're right, they must be one of those two.

It sounds like you're scared of bogey-corruption. A corruption that hides under the bed and destroys your innocent corruption-free country while it sleeps.

It is you who is not rooted in reality. You complain about the horrors of the EU, when it has only been positive for Sweden.

What does Sweden put in to the EU? Money.

What does Sweden get out of the EU? Market access.

So it seems that Sweden draws more wealth from this market access than it contributes to the EU. EU membership is a positive venture for Sweden.

So what would you do then?

Leave the EU? But, it's profitable. That would be negative for Sweden. And leaving the EU would not save you from the economic crisis. Norway is affected too you know. Hell, even China's economy is stalling.

So what then? What is your suggestion? A Neo-Kalmar Union? This is more rooted in feelings of nationalism than economic reality.

Several high-ranking German conservatives are anti-Russian. They claim that Russian money held in Cypriot banks are dirty. According to them, they may convince German MPs to vote for a plan that provides liquidity to Cypriot banks only if these Russians are affected. As there is no way to distinguish between savers, the brilliant idea was to tax them all. Following the backlash, the German Finance minister claimed that it was Cyrpus' idea to tax all savers. A few minutes ago, the Cypriot government vehemently denied that and revealed the initial offer they had on the table, which could result in losses up to 40%. As to why Russians are doing business with Cyprus and hold their money in Cypriot banks, it pretty simple. Greek Cypriots are also Orthodox Christians, the rates are competitive, and they can escape Putin's iron fist. Making money is not illegal, if some people cry ""foul"" they should first present evidence confirming what they say. Not to mention that it's comical to pretend that Switzerland and other tax and banking havens do not exist.

I think you can definitely affor it. If you need any further help make sure to PM me, i'll be glad to help you as much as I can :)

true,poupipou,MPyrenees,Midi-Pyrénées,"&gt;La remise en question n'a pas non plus l'air d'être le point fort des geeks/gamers.

Je parlais ici des membres de la communauté, pas du milieu du jeu vidéo dans son ensemble. Les réactions dans les commentaires de l'article, ici (""des cons y'en a partout sur le net"", ""c'est pareil dans les autres médias""...), ou même [le sujet que tu as posté](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1agvk6/en_plein_d%C3%A9bat_sur_le_sexisme_dans_les_jeux/) montrent bien qu'il est plus facile de reporter la faute sur les autres que de reconnaitre qu'il y a un problème.

&gt;Au contraire, le jeu vidéo s'est extrêmement ouvert et féminisé : les femmes représentent aujourd'hui 47% des joueuses dans le monde[1] , et 65% en France[2]

C'est justement de ça que traite le dossier. L'auteur utilise les mêmes chiffres (47%) et se pose alors la question : pourquoi alors qu'il y a autant de joueuses sont-elles si mal accueillies/traitées ? Pourquoi leur ""geekitude"" (il y a un nom pour ça ?) est remise en question ? Pourquoi les magazines, les concepteurs de jeux vidéos, les équipes marketing, les organisateurs de salon, etc. continuent à agir comme si leur seule cible était les ados hormonaux de 12 ans ?

&gt;Par contre, si tu as fait 2 secondes de psychologie masculine ou de psychologie de l'adolescent, tu sais qu'accuser et culpabiliser un mec va souvent produire une réaction de défense et JAMAIS de la remise en question.

Vraiment ? Est-ce que la puberté chez les garçons détruit la moitié de leurs neurones et leur supprime toute trace d'**empathie** ? Je pose la question sérieusement, parce que j'ai jamais été un gamin de 12 ans. Par contre j'ai été une gamine de 12 ans, qui a fait et dit des conneries. Et en règle générale, me mettre en face de mes actions/propos et de leur méchanceté avait pour conséquence une remise en question (avec un fort sentiment de honte), sans qu'on ait besoin de me dire ce que j'avais à y gagner. Si la capacité de se mettre à la place des autres est aussi inexistante chez ces personnes, je perds toute foi en l'humanité.

Mais ce n'est même pas la question. Parce que l'article ne s'adresse pas à eux. Il ne s'adresse pas à ceux (les ados mais pas seulement, des femmes, des hommes, de tout âge) qui ont ces comportements sexistes. Il s'adresse à ceux qui regardent le spectacle sans rien dire. Et l'auteur ne les culpabilise pas, elle leur dit seulement : ""Voila ce qui se passe, et la plupart du temps on laisse couler. Ce n'est pas normal. La prochaine que fois que vous êtes témoins d'un tel comportement , signalez-le, réagissez, commentez, mais ne restez pas sans rien faire ou rien ne changera.""

&gt;Nobody seems to be actually trying to solidify Europe into one entity, all everybody is doing is taking care of themselves

Well, I think you are being a bit harsh there. Nobody voted for a permanent transfer union, which is what is going to happen if one is to save it, nor for a United states of Europe. 

&gt;If anyone was really trying this crisis would have been over years ago, a combination of haircuts and quantitative easing would made for an acceptable amount of inflation to keep everybody solvent.

No, I think you are wrong here. It would take a lot more, and that is the problem. 

Think about it this way, it is Economics 101 that the southern states (or, shall we say those states who was cheaper, higher interest rates, less ""developed"" industries etc) would lose in internal competitiveness in a union. I think Greece/Spain/Portugal etc has lost between 20-30 % between 1999-2008. It is basic science, really. To offset this, you need to invest, and to transfer money, take care of the banks,help with foreign debt, full support of the people  etc. However, are you prepared to send X % of your GDP down south for the next 25 years? 

If you think I am exagerating, take a look at another currency union, DDR joining the BRD (West Germany). They were, like Portugal (for the sake of argument, I'll just write Portugal, but I mean Portugal/Spain/Greece)less competitive but so just like them, the had rising prices and high unemployment. However, unlike Portugal, they had their foreign debt taken care of, they had permanent transfers from the BRD to make sure that they had the basics, decent schools, unemployment benefits etc, they had banks, and they had huge amounts of investements from the German government. And, most important - the support of the people. Over the years, Germany has invested trillions in the DDR, and are still giving them over 100 billion/year. Yet, the unemployment is still higher and the productivity lower than in West Germany. 

Now, if you compare that with Portugal, so Potugal might be more competitive than DDR was, but they are still way less competitive than Germany. Add to that they have foreign debt, no security for the ""essentials"", like welfare  - in other words, no permanent transfers. Also, they do not have the massive investment from the German government. 23 years afterwards, you can still notice the difference between DDR/BRD, with all the help. How long do you think it will take for Portugal? 

Thinking that it would only take a bit of solidarity etc is, unfortunately, wrong. The Euro is wrongly constructed, and to save it will take enormous amounts of money, and that you give up your soverignity. How many % of you GDP are you prepared to permanently send down south? 20% ? Are you OK with paying of Spains debt, and making sure that the welfare payments in Portugal comes out of a Dutch pocket. 

Personally, I wouldn't be. Not because I hate those countries, or think ""they brought it on themselves""(OK, Greece a bit perhaps, but they have paid there dues). It is in the nature of the currency union, so no one, or everyone is to blame. 

I am just not prepared to be part of a United States of Europe. I do not want to send most of our GDP to Brussels. I do not think it makes me a bad person, and above all, if the EU is heading that way, it is of vital importance, that people get to vote - don't you think? Remember, people voted for a treaty where it said that they would not have to bail anyone else out, where each and every country would be responsible for their debt. Saying that one should change that, without voting about it, is not fair, and very un-democratic.

true,PTRJK,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I agree with his sentiment. We do have an unhealthy obsession with welfare which generally speaking, discourages aspiration and undermines our work ethic. 

A lot of people would rather we cut every public sector job, our investment in our economy and increase tax before cutting spending to our £170bn Welfare programme. As well as preferring that we'd lower the ceiling on wealth by squeezing the rich and putting a cap on success, more than raise the floor by increasing living standards and reducing the cost of living through tax cuts, more economic investment and creating more job opportunities. 

And I agree that people are over dependant on the state to manage their lives. It's also frustrating seeing parents having to phone the police to discipline their out of control kids or depending on teachers to bring them up. Too much state control may lead to a more caring state but less caring individuals and a society.  Change however, can only start from the top.

I'm not against welfare entirely but the system we have should be changed. Not only is it counter productive discouraging people to work or save for their own pension, it also costs too much. If we didn't have Welfare and someone suddenly suggested we spend £170bn on it, I'd think they were mad. It should be in it's tens of billions, not hundreds of billions.

**Edit:** Ideas; What would you guys think of privatising the benefit system and having 'Unemployment Insurance' instead? Where you could pay so much a month based on your income. An incentive for getting another job would be (like car insurance) the more often you claim and how much you claim, the higher your premium will be.

Also scrapping state payed pensions, at least for people working in the private sector but keeping the incapacity or disability benefit? So they keep working until they can't instead of simply no longer wanting to. And we can force people like surgeons in the public sector to retire at a certain age on safety grounds.

Comment ? Ces réactions montrent bien que cela n'est pas la bonne façon d'aborder un problème. Si le but recherché est de mieux accueillir les filles, reconnais que c'est un échec complet.

&gt;alors qu'il y a autant de joueuses sont-elles si mal accueillies/traitées ?

Euh, la plupart des joueuses sont très bien accueillies. Car la plupart des joueuses ne jouent pas aux jeux cités. De plus, ce ne sont que des exemples et des anecdotes, même si cela n'enlève rien au problème. Il est juste faux d'en faire une généralité.

&gt;Pourquoi les magazines, les concepteurs de jeux vidéos, les équipes marketing, les organisateurs de salon, etc. continuent à agir comme si leur seule cible était les ados hormonaux de 12 ans ?

Tu as loupé quelque chose ? La wii ? Les jeux sur mobile ? La création de personnages ? Ah non, il vaut mieux tomber dans la caricature et faire comme si ce qui est dénoncé, à juste titre, dans l'article, représentait la majorité. Perdu.

&gt;Est-ce que la puberté chez les garçons détruit la moitié de leurs neurones et leur supprime toute trace d'empathie ?

Commence par avoir des propos sans caricature, on parle de quelque chose d'extrêmement sérieux qui engendre beaucoup de souffrances. L'empathie n'est pas liée au nombre de neurones. Ensuite, toutes les études (par exemple [celle-là](http://www.ledevoir.com/societe/science-et-technologie/316568/la-testosterone-fossoyeuse-de-l-empathie)) montrent que les femmes ont d'avantage d'empathie que les hommes.

&gt;Et en règle générale, me mettre en face de mes actions/propos et de leur méchanceté avait pour conséquence une remise en question

Voui, car c'était exceptionnel et que tu ne trouvais pas de récompense à te faire engueuler. Il n'en est pas de même pour les garçons : le comportement rebelle fait partie de la construction de l'identité masculine. Je le déplore, mais un garçon sage est un bouffon, traité de suceur par ses pairs, et en général délaissé par les meufs.

&gt;Si la capacité de se mettre à la place des autres est aussi inexistante chez ces personnes, je perds toute foi en l'humanité.

Félicitation. Sinon tu pourrais essayer de comprendre pourquoi il est déconseillé aux garçons de faire preuve d'empathie. C'est là la clef. Tout le monde sera gagnant. Alors je repose la question : pourquoi est-ce que faire preuve d'empathie, c'est bien pour soi ?

&gt;ne restez pas sans rien faire ou rien ne changera.

Malheureusement la dénonciation produit l'effet inverse. Par contre, essayer de comprendre ceux qui ont des propos misogynes est un réel enjeu. Mais l'auteur passe complètement à côté et crée de la défiance. Contre-productivité maximale.

true,yaix,EURO,EU-DE,"Taxing the accounts below 100.000 EUR is stupid, because it undermines trust of normal people in the banking system. Unfortunately, the Cyprus government did not want to tax the wealthier people more than 10%. I would prefer they collected 15% from the wealthy and leave the money below 100.000 EUR untouched.

About Greece, I don't know if it has already the desired effect. 

People need to realize that corruption and nepotism (having a government job because your uncle is the boss, not paying taxes because ""only stupid people pay taxes"", voting for the corrupt local politician because he will get you some money you don't deserve, etc.) is not only damaging to an abstract ""country"" but to every single individual.
