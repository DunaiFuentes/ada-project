true,Poebbel,BAVA,Bayern,"Where are you from?

From my experience and what I've heard from others, uni in Germany isn't the booze and sex-filled craze it seems to be in some other countries. Mainly because most of us had our experimental phase with those things during school, but also because campus life doesn't have the same bubble feeling.

That being said, it's hard to generalize. From my experience, German girls tend to be less open than in the UK or US, which means that a typical US girl may unwillingly lead men on by simply being friendly and chatty to everyone. Still, you can have your fair share of one night stands and most people won't care. The whole FWB thing isn't big here, it seems that most are in commited relationship or rely on ONS to get through being single (which doesn't mean you won't find a man for an arrangement like that).

As for dating, don't expect too much. You most likely won't be picked up or brought home (except for sex) and the man paying everything is not a very established concept, so be prepared to split the bill, especially on a first date (seems weird, but why waste money on a girl you don't know that well). What men expect depends on what men you date, there really is no way of telling in general. As far as I'm aware, there is no ""three dates means sex"" rule (is that even a thing elsewhere?) or something comparable, so you'll just have to wing it. Talking is key, just like everywhere else.

&gt;&gt; The United States and the Soviet Union defined the world's first space race, but following South Korea's successful orbital rocket launch this week, it appears Asia -- particularly North Asia -- is the world's new epicenter for space rivalries in the 21st century.

&gt;I found this statement really quite quaint. For years, there have been three kinds of Space Advocates.  We can name them by their founders/champions.  

&gt;1. The Sagans see space as a playground for Science and only for Science.  They see a manned program at best as a diversion of funds that could be much better used to deploy more unmanned missions.  And at worst they see anything like settlements and colonization as dangerous because it might contaminate the pristine space environment they want to study.

&gt;2. The Von Brauns see space as an instrument for grand diplomacy and international politics and prestige.  They prefer manned missions because they capture public imagination, but have no agenda beyond exploration.  (Indeed settlements make them feel a bit worried, because they have great risk and failure is worse than lower goals in their mind since it's all about national prestige to them.)

&gt;3. The O'Neills don't care about either science or politics, they have the goal settlements, colonization, industrialization of space.

&gt;Until recent years, the O'Neills have been the weakest of the three factions policy-wise and at most gained concessions by allying with the Von Brauns to maintain a human space program that might someday be compatible with their goals, and possibly develop some supporting technology that will pave the way for settlement eventually.  Now, with a new space private sector involved (and its own decidedly O'Neill inspired industrial and settlement agenda largely independent of and impatient with the agenda of politicians), and with the Augustine Commission's explicit statement that the goal of the space program is infact to expand human civilization through out the solar system, and with budget cuts constantly threatening pure-science space missions, the O'Neills have finally become the dominant of the three factions.  As such, the vocabulary of the old space race (competing NATIONS engaged in what amounts to missions for mere prestige and exploration) is simply out-dated.    The real 'new space race' in the short term is this:

&gt;Which COMPANY is going to build a true affordable and therefore fully reusable (and I don't mean fake-reusable like the shuttle) launch vehicles.  The favorites are SpaceX (with it's grasshopper test of powered descent), and Reaction Engines (skylon), but there are others with the declared intention of playing for this field... Xcor, Stratolaunch, etc.  In the intermediate term, all of these efforts are also going to be profoundly effected by the companies that intend to reduce the need for heavy-launch from Earth by sourcing material in orbit from asteroids.

Mali did not call for the intervention; the undemocratic and Western-backed coup regime's antecedents did.

I think that the Turkish share of immigrants, if anything, was higher back then. They were the largest share of the ""guest worker"" program, and while a few Italians and Spaniards had been part of it, most people from Southern and Eastern European countries only came after their countries had joined the EU.

I believe this is more about socioeconomic tensions than anything else. As opposed to more recent immigrants, the ""guest workers"" didn't have much of an education and were hired for low paying jobs. Partly because of that, they didn't mix with the general population, and social mobility in Germany isn't very good (I blame our outdated three-tiered school system). Not quite as bad as e.g., in the UK, but almost. So, you have people who look different and are predominantly lower class. I'm sure that if their socioeconomically similar counterparts of the native population all had red hair, we'd see similar antagonism against gingers. Nobody has an issue with Turkish-German engineers, for example, but with what people have come to euphamise as ""youth"" -- and those are hardly Islamic fundamentalists but about as Muslim as most of the Christians around here, which is to say ""not very"".  
However, Islamists make a great target. Nobody likes them, not even the Muslim population that actually takes their faith seriously. And yet, they get thrown into the same category. I think that's because rejecting sharia law in Europe is something everybody can get behind, ridiculous as this perceived threat may be, and it lets people voice their antagonism in a seemingly rational way.

We'll see much more connectivity and data analysis in the future. And it's becoming much more sophisticated. Not just the computational capacity to collect and analyze data, but also the algorithms. Most people underestimate what [can already be done](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0), and [what effects](http://www.wired.com/business/2012/04/ff_klout/) will grow out of it. 

Data analysis, algorithmic profiling and the prediction of behavior are a two edged sword. There are great things that can be done with it that really help to give people the information that is relevant for them. Not just when they actively search for it, but as a push service (think Google Now, which is really just at the very beginning).  
However, I think it's important to retain control over your own personal data. This may be inconvenient for companies that want to build their business model around personal data as a commodity, but business isn't a purpose in itself.

Some say that, in the end, it's up to you whether or not you accept whatever it is e.g., Facebook wants to do with your data. IMHO, this argument is flawed, since most people don't have the knowledge to make an informed decision. Also, especially in the case of Facebook, which is based around social networks (in the classical sense), there is a point where the cost of not participating is detachment from your social environment. When planning of get-togethers happens within a proprietary environment, and social chatter, which plays an essential role in forming social groups, moves online, the refusal to participate means that you lose contact in the physical world.

So, instead of making consumers choose whether or not they want to play by the rules set by corporations, we should make corporations decide whether or not they want to play by the rules that we as a society set. If this means paying for services with money instead of personal data, and forces consumers to make a conscious decision about what kind of data they're comfortable sharing, so be it.",0,1359702945,null,0,false,0,c87el3x,t3_17o4ba,t1_c87el3x,t3_17o4ba,null,1431149257,21,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,21

Yes, you choose flight instead of fight.

**Holiday leave.** You did nothing to address my argument, so I'll rephrase myself. Holiday leave is not paid leave. You just choose to view it so, because it's convenient for you (as an employer, may I presume?). The employer pays for a certain service per year, divided in 12 (or 13 or 14 etc) salaries. Holiday leave is an amount of days per year contractually agreed upon by employer and employee that are not included in what the employer is paying for. That's it. It's not a favour the employer does. How sick days are managed is another issue. The courts have decided that the employer carries the burden and it's a matter of ideology. There's no right and wrong. I tend to agree with the court ruling, though a distribution among employer, employee and insurer might have been fairer.

Yes, you are being pedantic about car insurance, because you assumed he did the math wrong. Well the car insurances did the math wrong (deliberately of course), because according to simple maths the male premiums should have been even lower and the female ones not raised that much according to the ratio of the insured male and female drivers.

About the French, you are being condescending. Do you claim to know what powers may or may not have lobbied against protection measures? Maybe (probably) some French themselves decided to bring up the issue before the court, because their government closed its eyes to the problem. The exact example is irrelevant. A higher authority is often needed when the lower ones do not act the way they should. That's one of the reasons there are so many levels of justice. The EJC is one level more on the top.

I only addressed your EJC arguments because I found them rather weak. Hell, most of the EJC rulings you brought up weren't even that bad. I actually agree with them. If that's the worst, then it could very easily get better. My main concern with the EU is the strong capitalistic direction that Germany is taking abandoning slowly the social state of the past decades and Germany has the strongest voice within the EU at the moment.

I did not address the original question of the discussion because I find it pointless. It all boils down to whether one is willing to invest in the EU giving up a certain amount of control in order to join something bigger than themselves with all the benefits and downsides this comes with. UK doesn't because as you argue you believe the downsides are not worth the benefits and in the case of UK it might be true. Switzerland also isn't part of the EU and the actual reasons are not that different.

The Falmouth at the speed of 22+ knots (41+ km/h) rammed the Týr, almost capsizing her. The Týr did not sink and managed to cut the nets of Carlisle, after which the Falmouth rammed it again. The Týr was heavily damaged and propelled by only a single screw and pursued by the tug-boat Statesman. In this dire situation, Captain Guðmundur Kjærnested gave orders to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming superiority of firepower the Falmouth enjoyed, to deter any further ramming.

true,threep03k64,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I think this has to be looked at in context - this concerns an *informal* donation of sperm. This isn't the case of some anonymous guy jacking off into a cup to donate, then knocking on some strangers door in a year and demanding rights. If you need a sperm donor the advice is to go through the formal routes. There's several similar cases to be honest that show this. 

I see the issues with this - for sure I can see why people would prefer to receive the sperm of someone they know than a stranger (and I honestly don't know if there are formal routes of doing such) but I see the dilemma of the courts in cases where the biological father is a family friend and would therefore be in contact with the child anyway.

It's a fact that the majority of militaries in Europe are simply not fit for purpose.  There's eight strategic airlift planes in the entire EU, all of them belonging to Britain.  Without British or American help, the rest of the EU's military has to make do with co-opting civilian aircraft of has to stay within the EU's borders, twiggling their thumbs.

Im Vergleich zum Vollkommenen Markt ist diese Einschränkung des Wettbewerbs ineffizient und führt zu höheren Preisen, niedrigeren Verkaufsmengen und überhöhten Gewinnen der Produzenten (Monopolgewinne). Insbesondere Geringverdiener werden durch höhere Bücherpreise negativ betroffen.

&gt;Die Buchpreisbindung wird in mehreren Ländern, vor allem Deutschland und anderen EU-Staaten, mit einem kulturellen Argument verteidigt.

&gt;Es gibt jedoch eine Reihe von Gegenargumenten zur Annahme der Quersubventionierung durch Buchpreisbindung:

&gt;Quersubventionierungen von Erstlingsautoren oder anderen risikoreichen Projekten findet auch ohne Buchpreisbindung statt, etwa in der Hoffnung, einen Bestseller zu landen, was im Regelfall nicht vorhersehbar ist.

&gt;es gibt keine demokratische Kontrolle über die Verwendung der durch den Staatseingriff ermöglichten Monopolgewinne.

&gt;es gibt keine Garantie und keinen Anreiz, dass die Monopolgewinne bei Bestsellern tatsächlich zur Quersubventionierung von weniger populären Titeln verwendet werden.

&gt;selbst im Fall einer funktionierenden Quersubventionierung ist nicht klar, ob der resultierende kulturelle Nutzen (steigende Titelvielfalt) die Kosten der Marktverzerrung (steigende Bücherpreise) wettmacht

Il problema è al Senato, dove il premio di maggioranza a livello regionale crea una vera e propria lotteria. A questo punto, con un Senato bloccato, come sembra molto probabile dai sondaggi, Bersani non riuscirà a formare un governo PD+SeL e dovrà:

A) Governarne con l'appoggio della lista Monti, abbandonando SeL al suo destino. Governo = PD+Monti [opzione più probabile]

&gt; rejecting sharia law in Europe is something everybody can get behind, ridiculous as this perceived threat may be

Sharia is a type of threat. Not because Muslims will take the children, rape the wives, and burn the houses of Daily Mail readers, but in the sense that (any) dynamic interest groups shouldn't be allowed to create parallel legal structures in secular societies with established judicial branches. The most worrying aspect in this case is that it restricts the rights of vulnerable members of the Muslim communities. While it is true that they have the option to use civil courts, the peer pressure is huge and they don't want to be seen as traitors, eventually thrown out of their cultural environment and becoming outcasts. Even one woman finding herself in this position is one too many.

I was reading this a while ago:

http://news.yahoo.com/divorce-cases-could-soon-settled-under-sharia-law-095516943.html

&gt; Divorce settlements by religious courts including Sharia could soon be allowed under British law after a landmark legal decision. The move comes after a High Court referred a couple's divorce case for settlement under Beth Din, or Jewish law. According to the Times, it is the first time in British legal history when an English family judge has agreed to refer a divorce dispute to a religious court.

In the end, it's not about Sharia, Beth Din, or similar structures.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Holiday leave is not paid leave. You just choose to view it so, because it's convenient for you (as an employer, may I presume?). The employer pays for a certain service per year, divided in 12 (or 13 or 14 etc) salaries. Holiday leave is an amount of days per year contractually agreed upon by employer and employee that are not included in what the employer is paying for.

If it's contractually agreed beforehand it's still paid leave.  You're on extra leave, having already used and booked your contractual leave, still receiving pay whilst not working.

It's not a matter of convenience to think of it as such.  It's a matter of what harms the jobs market.  Not by a decision by the government, but a decision by a judge that has no idea whatsoever about UK employment law.  None.  No experience or insight whatsoever.  At least the EFTA surveillance agency and court is made up of their own national judges.

&gt;Yes, you are being pedantic about car insurance, because you assumed he did the math wrong.

No, I know he did the maths wrong because he said meet it in the middle as if it were perfectly Normally distributed, and contrary to convenience not all insurance companies are the same and some did work it out to split the costs.  Only the reductions they announced for the male drivers, whilst not insignificant, still didn't stop the female rates from shooting up.  It is a simple fact that more young males drive and seek insurance in that age category, and on average either claim more or have more claims made against them.  There is a boy racer culture that doesn't transcend gender.  It still remains that the ruling destroyed business models that focused primarily on female drivers, and the court prevented insurance companies to identify risk over political correctness.

&gt;I only addressed your EJC arguments because I found them rather weak. Hell, most of the EJC rulings you brought up weren't even that bad.

You might not think they're that bad, but in an argument in what the UK gains from leaving; the employers, the job market, the cost of living, the cost of bureaucracy, the delay because of bureaucracy, the unnecessary over layering of redundancy, the grab on sovereignty (argued by judges and representatives of other typically pro-EU countries), the attack on intellectual rights, they are all bad for the UK - and that's with the UK being one of the most abiding countries behind Finland.  To put it another way, the UK attempts to stick to the rules more than most and still get hit hard by something which could easily be rendered redundant - avoided - without any loss.

The UK can provide its own judgments, through judges and courts familiar with UK law and that are already set up and paid for.  There is no need to reform a court that doesn't respect its own limitations (even choosing to cite ECHR as precedence when it has no right to, even ruling against the insurance companies against the EU laws which allows them to discriminate when there's statistical evidence to support it) - all encroachments of power, which damage the jobs market, cost money, and set people back on a legislative minefield making the EU less competitive.

Yesterday they managed to increase the cost of airfare onto airlines instead of airports, because the airports aren't going anywhere but we all know the airlines are precarious and need an extra stealth charge out of their control...another homerun by the ECJ.  When the ECJ make a ruling its not against a single employer that has misinterpreted or stepped outside the law, they regularly on whim pass rulings that changes whole industries without any understanding of their ramifications.

-------------

I didn't even go into the ECJ, or who the politicians responsible were, who how the EU is an affront to democracy, in the original post, amongst many points.  I only went onto the ECJ because an original responder, about a summation and briefly mentioning getting back the judicial powers, went on about the ECHR in block capitals.

The argument for the ECJ, one which trumps all considerable economic arguments, is simple.   Sovereignty.  It puts the courts and sovereignty back locally, domestically, and not at the hands of a supranational state that has no knowledge of domestic law, and is even ropey, it seems, on EU law.

Oh, un po' di fantapolitica :)

Il chiaro intento di regole per limitare la partecipazione era proprio quello di far partire svantaggiato Renzi. Lo staff bersanian-dalemiano sapeva benissimo che Renzi raccoglieva consensi oltre l'elettorato tipico del PD (e del PCI prima). Apparte l'inserimento di alcune regolette, e la mobilitazione di orde di vecchietti con tessera PD [Bersani ha stravinto nelle regioni del SUD], l' ""apparato"" non ha fatto molto altro. Il resto ci hanno pensato gli elettori delle primarie.

- «*Renzi potrà diventare il nuovo segretario?»* 

Realisticamente? No. Ha il 40% tra gli elettori del centrosinistra, ma all'interno del partito le idee liberal trovavano e trovano poco spazio. Soprattutto dopo le primarie parlamentari, grande mossa di Bersani per rafforzare le sue quote in parlamento.
Il destino del partito è legato alla sua quota fissa di elettori massima tra il 30-33% (come il PCI di una volta). È il massimo che può fare con questo schema. 
Senza entrare troppo nella questione, i dirigenti del PD dovrebbero aprire gli occhi, capire e perché no anticipare la società moderna, non adattarvisi sempre in ritardo.

Pour ce qui est des agences, je déconseille, au final, pour etre passé avec certaines, les annonces sont moins nombreuses, en général plus cher et presque invariablement non meublé (apres ce n'est pas forcément un probleme, ca depend du logement recherché)
Le point positif des agences, c'est surtout la vérification des appartements qui assure généralement certaines normes, et donc il y a moins de chance de tomber sur des vices cachés.

Pour ma part, je m'en tiendrai à pap et leboncoin, c'est ce que j'ai fait majoritairement, ca prend du temps, mais une agence ne garanti pas nécessairement des resultats plus rapides, et a ma connaissance, il n'y a pas vraiment d'autres sites de contact direct pour les appartements.

Then there are those countries that have cultural restrictions on gender but have gone on to have female presidents and prime ministers e.g. Banazir Bhutto, female, PM of Pakistan. 

The important thing is that minorities have no difficulty being elected to public office, certainly in Western Europe, and when they are their ethnicity is rarely even brought up as an issue.  At that point it's difficult to see their ethnicity as being a glass ceiling, not as much as it was seen as a milestone in the US, for completely understandable reasons from a historic perspective.  In Europe it was more about the suffragette movement, that was their milestone, and now people don't really think twice about there being female European leaders.

It's also difficult to see the Gypsy issue, which exists, as an ethnic issue rather than a cultural/life-choice issue.  A gypsy, remember, is completely indiscernible to any other European outside the constraints of their lifestyle.  When they stop being a traveller, settle down, and integrate into society, they are completely indistinguishable from anybody else, and it's impossible to get elected without settling down, having a career, for anybody; so it's not like skin colour or religion in that respect (although I do support more recognition of travellerer/gypsy lifestyle and tailoring tax and legal systems to accommodate a traveller lifestyle so they can be seen to be contributing and integrated).

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Correct me if you like but it was founded in the 1870s after a war in which all the non-Danish speaking parts of Denmark were annexed by Germany.

Exactly.

&gt; It may be difficult to accept, but Denmark made her wealth through international trade

Why in the world would you assume that this would be difficult to accept? This is the truth — we have no natural resources to speak of, and literally all of our wealth comes from human resources, as it were: Trade, services, technology.

&gt;  (has it never occurred to you why the corporate tax rates are so low or why unlike other similarly sized countries the Danes almost universally speak at least English fluently as well)

As a non-native English speaker, I have to say that you're operating with a very liberal interpretation of the word ""fluent"" here. The Danes are good at English. They're not universally fluent, trust me. :) However, Danish affinity for learning English has come after WW2 and especially after the Marshall Plan. Before that, it was largely German and French. Anyway, your point stands: Danes learn foreign languages because it is good for the economy to do so.

&gt; but ask the man on the street across the world to name five Danish companies, and if they could, they would all be either food/brewing or shipping conglomerates with the possible niche exception of FLS which is so international it is only passably danish.

That's a pretty absurd way to measure the Danish economy, though. Service and technology companies aren't *in* the businesses that ""the man on the street"" would be familiar with. The numbers and companies that make up the Danish economy are publicly available, though, I don't see why you would choose to disregard them just because you don't know them off the top of your head?

true,Delheru,FINL,Finland,"I think the most fundamental reason is that there is no embedded elites in the Nordic countries. Sweden comes closest (there's some *old* money in there), but the elites aren't significant enough in size to form a bubble where they just reinforce each others prejudices (see: US country clubs, bars near Wall Street, City of London).

This means that there isn't anyone trying to manipulate the situation to their own advantage as there's no culture among the masses of doing this (largely because fucking around with shared activities was unhealthy in a frozen tundra back in the 14th century - getting chucked out of the city in Greece was a breeze by comparison).

Now without anyone in politics *for themselves* (I'm sure some are, but it is very rare) and echo chambers not really existing... well, the situation is already VERY good.

Oh to be sure, we have complete idiots in politics. Hell, we probably have *more* idiots in politics than most places, but I think I'll take the idiots over clever sociopaths (who would quickly form an echo chamber and it'd all start going downhill).

The whole topic is interesting because in a way it goes against the premise of EU by pointing out the benefits of small units. However, EU need not interfere with these benefits as long as the central operation merely does things like standardization, foreign politics, military and *expensive* science.

An organization already went to court to sue Bayer Zsolt but the court dismissed it on some grounds that I can't remember right now (this case is from the first week of January). 

The background of the story is that a group of Gypsies attacked some people during New Year and one guy almost died.

Some quotes from [the original article](http://www.magyarhirlap.hu/ki-ne-legyen):

&gt; Mindeközben a cigányság ezen állattá lett fele az idióta nyugati világ „vívmányait” használja

At the same time, those Gypsies that have become animals use the ""achievements"" of the idiotic Western world.

&gt; Aztán eljött szilveszter éjszakája, és eljött megint vagy negyven rohadt állat cigány, köztük az a bizonyos Jónás János, és nekilátott ölni

And then came New Year's eve, and again came some forty disgusting animal Gypsies, among them Jónás János, and started to kill.

Because, they are not humans.

That's the problem. There are no actual set definitions, its just convention. South Americans consider it to be one, single continent, as per their convention. 

Anyway the idea of division based on culture is manifold:  

1) Culture doesn't just abruptly stop over a continental border, its more like a spectrum. Syria has more in common with Greece than it has with Japan for instance. Somalia more in common with Yemen than Lesotho.    
Does the part of Kazakhstan west of the Ural mountains have a ""definite European culture"" that is distinct from the eastern side? Seems dubious.  And you may be able to talk about this idea of European culture, but you'll certainly have a hard time coming up with what ""Asian culture"" would be. 

2) How far down the rabbit hole do you go when divided up regions based on culture? Why the European continent and not the Scandinavian continent? People use cultural-geographical groupings all the time... East Asia, The Middle East, Latin America and so forth. Using a specific geographical only definition would be the way to make a distinction between these groupings and actual continents. 

The main problem with the existing continent system is just Europe I suppose. You could argue that the pieces of land connecting America and Afro-Euroasia are small enough to count them as separate landmasses. But separating Europe, I understand why it was done, but its sorta silly now.

In Paris and in France in general, you get quite a lot of student discounts or -25/26 year old discounts, but it's not an obligation (some cinemas do it, McDo does it with the Imagin'R card I reckon, etc.). Your student card should work everywhere. Some schools deliver an ISIS student card (www.isic.fr/), that is advertized to be international. From my experience, the only place where they specifically required that card was in Turkey. I don't know if you can just apply if it's not the standard card delivered by your school. From a quick look at their website they seem to offer quite a few discounts ; up to you to see if it's worth it.

For travels, you can also get a Carte 12-25 from SNCF to get 25-50% discount on train tickets. (TIL they are now called cards 18-27 by searching you a link) : www.sncf.com/fr/tarifs-reduits/carte-jeune

Es gibt immer einige Individuen die weitaus rücksichtsloser fahren (Rad und auch Auto), als es gesund wäre. Leider bleiben uns diese schlechten Beispiele immer im Gedächtnis. Die geringe Geräuschentwicklung von Fahrrädern sowie deren ständige Nähe zum gehenden Verkehr trägt seines gleichen dazu bei.

Ich persönlich bin zu jeder Zeit bedacht besonnen und fair zu fahren. Auch Fußgänger verhalten sich oft rücksichtslos oder mutieren zu Handy-Zombies, die ihre Umgebung nicht mehr wahrnehmen. Aber ich zeige Verständnis dafür und tue mein Bestmöglichstes, diesen Gefahren aus dem Weg zu gehen.

Doch leider gibt es einige Stellen in Aachen wo ich mir als Fahrradfahrer denke, dass egal was ich mache, ich mindestens einen anderen Verkehrsteilnehmer oder mich selbst unnötig in Gefahr bringe.

Mein liebstes Beispiel ist die Junkerstraße auf dem Weg zur Schanz. Fahre ich auf der Straße, kann ich unmöglich an dem steilen Berg mit dem Autoverkehr mithalten. Folge ist, dass ich unnötig riskant überholt werde, da an dieser Stelle der gesetzlich geforderte Mindestabstand von 1,5-2m keines wegs eingehalten werden kann. Fahre ich auf dem viel zu schmalen Gehweg, was an der Stelle durchaus erlaubt ist, müssen mir häufig Fußgänger aus dem weg gehen. Fahre ich hinter ihnen, fühlen sie sich durch mein herannahendes (helles) Fahrradlich bedroht und springen geradezu aus dem Weg. Klingle ich, empfindet man es als Beleidigung und Drängeln.

The Irish have recently had a similar concern.

It's a big thing.  Not free migration, which is allowed within the EU, but asylum from outside.   Asylum seekers, which should be given refuge at the first port, are making their way across Europe and beyond the Schengen, and making their way where the system plays, and pays, more by the rules.

true,liteDeck,null,null,"&gt;FRANKFURT—Euro-zone unemployment rose to a record in December, capping a year that saw jobless ranks rise by nearly two million as Europe's debt crisis ravaged employment markets along the region's southern border.

&gt;Nevertheless there were some bright spots and signs labor markets are stabilizing.

&gt;German unemployment was near record lows, and Spanish joblessness showed a rare downtick, albeit from crisis levels. Unemployment increased at a far slower pace in December compared with the rest of 2012. Recruiters say there are pockets of strength in sectors such as energy and health care even in Spain, where unemployment is over 26%.

&gt;Unemployment in the euro zone rose 16,000 in December to a high of 18.7 million, said Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency. The jobless rate held steady at 11.7% despite wide disparities across countries. German unemployment was 5.3% in December and Austria's rate was 4.3%, versus 26.1% in Spain and 16.5% in Portugal.

&gt;""In Europe, it looks like we are at the bottom and we will probably get into a better mode in the second half of 2013,"" said Hans Leentjes, ManpowerGroup's president for Northern Europe.

&gt;Still, the figures highlight a risk for the bloc's economy, which has failed to expand since the summer of 2011. Increased stability in financial markets and easing bond yields, making it easier for countries to borrow, haven't translated into the business activity needed to stem the rise in joblessness.

&gt;A report Friday from the ECB showed that private-sector borrowing costs haven't moved down in tandem with government bonds, and that Spanish and Italian small businesses still pay higher interest rates than their German peers.

&gt;""We're not seeing the magical 2%"" growth in gross domestic product needed to create jobs in Europe, said Alan Townsend, senior vice president at employment firm Monster. Euro-zone GDP is expected to have declined around 1.5% in the fourth quarter and should be flat in the first three months of 2013. ""Everybody's watching everybody else…nobody's actually generating any level of business activity,"" Mr. Townsend said.

&gt;Sectors such as public service and manufacturing mirror the effects of Europe's three-year-old debt crisis. Much of the 17-member currency bloc, particular southern Europe and Ireland, have slashed state payrolls in order to reduce large government debt loads. Public-administration employment fell by around 350,000 in the euro zone from the start of 2011 through last summer, according to quarterly Eurostat figures. More than 250,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost as southern Europe struggles to regain competitiveness by cutting labor costs. Construction has shed employment, mostly in Spain.

&gt;But there are sectors, such as health care and energy, which are hiring even in crisis-hit countries such as Spain, experts said.

&gt;""The energy sector is a growth engine in nearly every country. In Spain it is absolutely a good sector. Health is growing and is expected to be where you'll see the skills shortage. For experienced salespeople there's demand in every sector,"" said Mr. Leentjes.

&gt;Employment in the euro zone has grown in computer programming, architecture, engineering and health care, according to Eurostat data.
Spain's energy industry has added a few thousand jobs since the start of 2011, reflecting investment in renewable energy. Health care has also increased. Even in Greece, where most sectors have seen large drops in employment, there are some bright spots. Employment at drug makers is up, as are jobs at electricity suppliers.

&gt;Automobile manufacturers in France shed 20,000 jobs between early 2011 and the third quarter of last year, and manufacturing as a whole has lost nearly 70,000 positions. That has been offset by gains in waste collection, restaurants and health care. Germany bucked the weakening trend in manufacturing, adding more than 100,000 jobs since the start of 2011. Its vibrant export sector emerged from the 2009 recession better than its European peers, aided by flexible labor markets and exposure to fast-growing emerging markets.

&gt;Job-vacancy data from the European Commission reflect economic divergence across the euro bloc. In Northern European countries where unemployment is low, there is demand for high-skilled professions. Finance and sales associates are in top demand in Germany, and there are vacancies for electric and machinery mechanics, architects and engineers. Companies in the Netherlands need engineers and machinery mechanics.

&gt;Idled workers in countries with high unemployment may have to scale back hopes for a high-paying job. In France, Greece and Portugal, the workers in demand are for housekeeping and restaurant jobs.",0,1359756696,null,0,false,0,c87rfld,t3_17pxd9,t1_c87rfld,t3_17pxd9,null,1431155390,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

If there was a confusion, or an implication of ignorance, I apologise.

&gt;I know about the asylum applications. Being a Greek, I also know about the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter the EU via Turkey.

I agree with you, and it's one of the ways, beyond the endless bailouts which I'm somewhat opposed to without reciprocal action, in which the EU, or EU member states, should help Greece on.  It is fair game to call Greece out on certain matters which should be dealt purely at Greek hands, and held at Greek responsibility, on some they should hold their hands up and admit that it is unfair to put responsibility purely at Greek hands.  Borders is one of these issues.

&gt;This would cause a humanitarian crisis in any EU country,

Agreed.  But it's a far stretch when the problem comes as far as Ireland and the UK.  It shouldn't even hypothetically apply.  Asylum seekers are moving through EU states.  

The UK should rightfully have their own asylum burdens from the quasi-Commonwealth and colonial pasts, which it should deal with, but asylum from the East, having crossed numerous EU countries, shouldn't be it.  Same with the Netherlands, Scandinavia (certainly Western), and Ireland.

Deuteronomy 17

&gt;If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant; (17:3) And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded; (17:4) And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel; (17:5) Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

There are also a number of instances where rape, slavery, and murder are specifically advocated against the enemies of Christians.

Op is about an American governmental agents attempting to overstep their boundries in Iceland, so naturally I assumed that's what we were talking about here.

I'm talking about the actions of the American *government* not that of its individual nationals or corporations or organisations that happen to originate from there.

For the military stuff it is an open secret that Sweden relied on assumed American help in the event of a war with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The Swedish military was an impressive one in its own right during the period, especially the airforce, but there was never any doubt that Sweden would in the case of a Soviet invasion be expecting help from NATO.

This is not the case any more but it certainly was historically. The hypothetical war never happened though so of course there are no historical events to point out. WW2 is a lousy example.

Shall we ban people from wearing hoodies and baseball caps too? And what about motorcycle helmets and balaclavas..

&gt; In our society we attempt to achieve equality and we all have a right to it, but we must also respect others' beliefs. However, if these beliefs infringe upon the equality of an entire gender then I believe it should be stopped.

Who gave you the authority to dictate the moral high ground? Their are many strong independent minded Muslim women who choose to wear some sort of covering.

&gt; I do not believe all Muslims are bad people and that all Muslims are full of hatred, but Islam, at its core, is a very hate-filled religion. It is the case today that everyone must be careful of how we speak of Islam because it can often be misinterpreted as hatred and sheer ignorance when being critical about it. Which I think is unfair considering the likes cannot be said about most other major world religions.

Ahaha, the same could be said of Christianity, Judaism, etc, etc. If you're an atheist surely you realise that it's not the religion that's the problem, but the way in which it is interpreted for benefit of the person.

&gt; Muslims contribute a lot to society, however I believe that certain sects are intolerant of our culture and believe that their culture is the way forward regardless of what we think. This too could be said about us, we are forcing out culture on them, but this is illogical because our culture is to not force culture.

It's a two way street, what have you done recently to try and help the Muslims in your community.

&gt; The reason I'm explaining myself is to try and show my train of thought and that I'm not a racist bigot. I haven't deeply looked at the subject, only scratched the surface. I would appreciate other points of view.

You are a bigot

&gt; I imagine I'm probably preaching to the choir. I think a lot of people in Europe are a bit fed up: newspaper HQ being bombed in Denmark over drawings of Mohammed and the banning of the burka in France. But I thought I'd ask and see the variety of opinions on the matter.

Do you know how many Muslims reside in Europe? Estimates put the figure at around 38 million (or around 5% of the total population), so yeah, lets blame the whole religion on the actions of a few.

What about the rise of Christian neo-nazis in Greece, do we tar all Greek people with the same brush? No, I didn't think so.

Bigot.

Translating literally:

&gt; You have *but one* **nice** skirt

The phrase ""but one"" in English signifies you have *only* one, or that this example is unique. Not really used that much at all (you would sound kinda old-fashioned), but I'm guessing the language has a shared history here.

So, if you wanted to be bitchy, you could use the phrase to show that you are surprised that they own *anything* nice. Alternatively, if you wanted to be complimentary, you can use the phrase to single out *just how good* this skirt is (as in, better than any other good skirts).

Libya and Mali (logistically) disagree. The French and British are carrying all the military weight besides us, they're the only European powers with actual power projection. While they're capable of short, precise interventions, time and time again shows they are incapable of sustaining long-term deployments (such as Libya &amp; Mali) without help. 

And since all of Europe is content with the *status quo*, that means my country gets stuck helping two European nations while the rest of the continent sits around (they contribute, but not nearly to the degree of France and Britain, much less the United States). 

&gt;If America is annoyed with the bill, America can reduce its NATO foot print in proportion to how much other nations are. If that leaves a cavity where defence needs to be deployed in Europe, European nations can fill that cavity and maybe even fill it using more pooled EU resources.

That's exactly what Obama and the NATO Chief are saying. In a sense, you agree with them. We're pivoting towards the Pacific, we're not going to be around like we were in and directly after the Cold War. **We're not in the European Union**. Help your fellow Unionmen. 

&gt;If America is constantly providing our defence, why are we going to raise? It's a ""Put up, or shut up"" kind of argument. We'll deal with our military inefficiencies when we need to and that time wont come so long as the US is perfectly happy to deal with our inefficiencies for us.

That's a childish view and you know it. We're not going to abandon Europe, as much as I myself agree with your *""force them""* strategy and think we should.

[Are you 100% positive?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics)

&gt;the middle east doesn't have the power to cause any issues

Isn't Southern Europe on the verge of a humanitarian crisis because of immigrants seeking asylum in wartorn countries from the Middle East? Didn't the European-intervention in Libya require heavy American logistical support? And more importantly from a realpolitiks view, doesn't Europe get most of it's oil from the Middle East? 

&gt;africa holds no nations that are a threat. 

Hence why France was practically begging for European and American logistical support in Mali? Like I said, Britain and France possess power projection, but only enough for short, precise interventions. Sustained campaigns are in constant need of logistical support from the United States *(and to a far lesser extent, other European countries)*, as Mali and Libya show. It's far more evident in Mali where you have to oust and keep out Muslim Extremists.

You suggest that there is no threat, yet France wasn't so keen on having a terrorist safehaven akin to 90s Afghanistan on it's doorstep. Plus add in the realpolitik elements of solar power/oil from Algeria and uranium from Niger, and you see why Africa is important to Europe. 

&gt; Currently we need more money in secret services anti terrorism that sort of thing.

Do you know how much money the United States has sunk in around the globe for shit like that? Sure, it works when the participating nations are competent and determined (A.U. in Somalia), but if the local forces arn't, you get shit like Mali. Many people would avoid a military intervention, but reality reminds us that sometimes, we don't have a choice. 

&gt;However if we need to use our power abroad, such as Libya the rest of Europe would need to chime in. We have the tech, the training we just need quantity.

Yes, the rest of Europe **does** need to chime in. That's what Obama and this NATO Chief are implicating. The United States is pivoting towards the Pacific, and without Europe as it's main focus, NATO becomes a shell of what it used to be. 

Europe has the tech, and they have the training too, and they have the money to keep funding both, but they lack the will. They've become comfortable with the status quo of letting the United States, France and U.K. carry most the weight when it comes to defensive power projection. It's freed up spending for healthcare and shit, which is great, but unfair and impractical in the long-term. Volunteers are slow in coming, and conscription has been removed in many countries since the end of the Cold War. 

Europe is a soft power. So Europe either gets it's shit together, or it's forever stuck with the United States *(or Russia, maybe China)* dictating it's foreign policy. Personally, as a American, I would rather you stuck with us, but I'd MUCH RATHER see you guys in charge of your own destinies instead of being the pawns of either Russia or China.

The problem people have is no-one likes being told what to do. Even if it's friendly advice, telling someone they are weak does not go down well.
Should the US not have been around with Libya we would have just bought armaments ourselves. However the US likes spending money on war as it makes the arms manufactorers huge amounts of money. It's vested interest (not for the general population sadly).

France has not begged for help, they don't need it, it would be nice and would come in handy, but they would not have started it if they could not do it alone. The UK is only offering about 100 people in non combat roles.

I'm arguing that the Swedish relative tolerance of the US *government* (which is decidedly **not** the same as US based international corporations) has very little to do with direct economic concerns within our country and is in large parts about politics and ideology.

Sweden *was* dependent on the USA for protection throughout the Cold War. This was the past, obviously, and it's not necessarily the case today, but back in the day it certainly was. The ingenuity of the Swedish model hangs upon its ability to claim complete neutrality while not actually being very neutral at all. This we did. It's in the past now, but it did happen.

*You* brought up WW2, not me. It's not really relevant, honestly. Before WW2 Sweden was a third world country. It was among the poorest most shitty shitholes that Europe had to offer. Old Sweden was not Modern Sweden. But I was never talking about that, I was only talking Swedish realpolitik during the Cold War.

So I still don't see your original point. If the FBI acted like they did in this story towards Sweden - sending agents to investigate a non-violent political movement with ties to this country - how is that working towards preserving American market interests within our own economy?

I only brought up the CIA because they *have* been spying on Swedish citizen within Sweden with the Swedish government's knowledge and consent. It was supposed to be an example of how US *government* interest interferes with (from a US perspective) foreign states. It has to do with American *private market* interests in an indirect manner only. Still our government has let US *government* agents act freely within our country.

One reason is that many countries allow citizens to sponsor their extended families. As you can imagine, that goes on and on and on. I sponsor my parents, they sponsor my brother, he sponsors his wife, she sponsors her sister, etc.

Really, though, it's not that hard to immigrate to most European countries if you are determined and savvy, and the people saying ""Good luck, they have very strict immigration policies"" are mostly just repeating something they heard somewhere.

true,marcoil,CATA,Catalonia,"No offence taken, of course :) But I think my point stands: Spain is neither centralized or federal, which provokes a lot of conflict; and the way public money is distributed between central and autonomous governments is a huge headache.

&gt;The power to legislate on each matter depends on how it is constitutionally allocated (on the constitution and the subsequent CCourt decisions I mentioned before).

But for all transferred competences, the central government can pass ""Base Laws"" that set how competences have to be implemented. For example, right now there's a law project telling all communities how to organize basic school curricula. If Spain was federal, such laws wouldn't be possible, or if it was centralized, they would be the only laws.

&gt; Also, it is the autonomous community who decides what competences it wants to assume when they approve their fundamental laws (estatutos).

Competences may be transferred even if they aren't listed in the statute. And some statutes say ""all these competences and any further ones after negotiation"".

&gt; The competence over the different taxes ranges from 100% state to 100% community. In some the communities decide everything and keep all the money, in some they decide only on rabates and surcharges and keep part of the money, in some they administer the collection and keep the money, but do not legislate, etc.

Yes, they can set some rates, but what I said was ""collects all taxes"". Even when the rates are different, the central gov. gets all the money and then distributes it.

&gt; The autonomous communities obviously do not pay for the central education ministry. Taxpayers do, with the part of their money that is allocated to the central government.

Well, of course in the end it's the people who pay taxes, but they have to pay for two different administrations on each competence, which wouldn't be the case in a centralized or federal state.

&gt; Actually, autonomous communities are much less indebted in gross terms than the central state. In other words, independently of where it comes form, their money needs vs. money actually received ratio is much better.

It demonstrates that people don't want to genuinely find out what the real causes of these attacks are - they just want to blame the out group and pretend that getting rid of them will make everything nice and rosey.

As I've said already, there *are* big problems with radical Islam these days in the West - problems that we don't seem to have with Christianity.  But that doesn't mean that the nature of the religion is fundamentally to blame.  The issue is far more complex than that, and requires far more deeper thought than 'Muslims are bad'.

Sie treten hier vehement dagegen ein, dass ein Mann einer Frau ihre offensichtlichen Reize vergegenwärtigen darf und nehmen sich im gleichen Atemzug das recht heraus öffentlich auf Männer herabzublicken, die sie niemals persönlich zu Gesicht bekommen haben.  
&gt; Und hier zeigst Du, dass Du keinen Schimmer hast, kleiner Mann.  

Wenn sich die junge Frau so sehr ein professionelles Umfeld bei ihrer Arbeit wünscht, warum trifft sie sich dann spätabends an einer Hotelbar um ihrer Arbeit nachzugehen. Wenn dieser Akt der wiederlich sexistischen Herabwürdigung das schlimmste ist, was zu einer Frau gesagt wurde, die sich einen Beruf ausgesucht hat, der davon lebt ungemütlich zu sein, dann ist die junge Journalistin wahrlich zu beneiden.  
Ich will hier keinesfalls als Verteidiger von Sexismus jeglicher Art erscheinen, aber es muss doch jedem klar sein, dass hier eine Vielzahl von Abstufungen geht. Um ihr Beispiel ""blöde Neger-Sprüche"" zu benutzen: es ist sicherlich rassistisch auf die Straße zu gehen und dunkelhäutige Mitbürger als blöde Neger zu beschimpfen. Erfüllt es aber auch den Tatbestand des Rassismus, wenn ich meiner Tochter ein klassisches Kinderbuch vorlese in dem nunmal ein Negerlein und ein Zigeuner vorkommt? Ich habe bisher noch keinen Dunkelhäutigen getroffen der sich darüber aufregt.   
Eine Frau muss genauso wie jeder andere, seien es Männer, Immigranten, Ostfriesen, Rothaarige, Schwule, Nerds oder sonstwas,  auch damit klarkommen wenn sie gelegentlich auf ihr Frau-sein angesprochen wird. Es liegt in der Natur der Sache, dass die hervorstechenden Merkmale einer Personengruppe auch einmal benannt werden. Wie bei allem macht auch hier die Dosis das Gift. Genau diesen Punkt macht die Autorin des hier geposteten Artikels meiner Meinung nach sehr klar, auch wenn sie die Dame hier öffentlich als weltfremd und dumm hinstellen wollen (wäre das jetzt nicht auch eine Herabwürdigung der Frau wenn sie ein Mann wären?). Indem eine flapsige Bemerkung von Herrn Brüderle jetzt zu einem unsäglichen Akt des Sexismus hochstilisiert wird wird den wahren Opfern von Sexismus ihre Glaubwürdigkeit und ihre dringend benötigte Aufmerksamkeit entzogen.  
Ich möchte nicht in einer Welt leben, in der ich immer nur hundertprozentig politisch korrekte Dinge sagen darf und mit bei jedem Kommentar den ich mache überlegen muss ob er von irgendjemanden als Verbreche gegen die Menschlichkeit wahrgenommen wird. Ich bin mir sicher sie möchten das auch nicht. Hören sie auf sich hinter Scheinheiligkeiten zu verstecken. Auch sie provozieren andere Menschen mit ihren Äußerungen. Verbieten sie diese und sie nehmen dem Leben ihr Salz.

Quella sulla prima casa lo è, a patto che le detrazioni siano adeguate. Considerando che l'IMU ""pesa"" per meno di 100 euro a persona in media all'anno, e che _il 30% dei proprietari già non la sta pagando perché le detrazioni superano la tassa_, direi che si può migliorare nei dettagli ma nel principio è giusta.

Faccio un esempio. Io abito in una casa di proprietà dei miei, quindi pago l'IMU come seconda casa (la dovrebbero pagare loro, ma lo faccio io per gentilezza). Sono circa 550 euro. Se fosse prima casa, l'aliquota più bassa la farebbe scendere a 300 euro circa e avrei 300 euro di detrazioni, quindi non pagherei praticamente niente già adesso! Non è un villone con parco, ma neanche un monolocale.

Qualche tempo fa Macrat spiegava che per sua nonna l'IMU è un salasso perché abita da sola nella villa di famiglia, ma la nonna non può permettersela perché ha pensione minima e zero risparmi. La domanda allora è: ma quando la nonna non ci sarà più, cosa farà la famiglia della villa? Se com'è probabile la venderà, perché non farlo adesso lasciando l'usufrutto alla nonna (la cosiddetta ""nuda proprietà"")?

In other liberalised markets, tendering of public service contracts has shown savings of 20-30% for a given level of service which can be re-invested to improve services. 


How about Estonia? As I understand they privatised their passenger railways but it was fiasco and they bought back railway from private investor.

Dariah:

&gt;Beim Slutwalk geht es darum, dass kein noch so knappes Outfit eine Rechtfertigung dafür sein kann, eine Frau zu vergewaltigen, nicht etwas um das Recht, sich wie eine Schlampe anzuziehen. Bitte besser recherchieren. \r\nFerner wird hier appelliert, es sollte nicht pauschalisiert werden, sondern differenziert. Leider ist mein Eindruck, dass genau dies in diesem Beitrag nicht geschieht. Ferner wird hier der Eindruck vermitelt, dass Frauen sich doch bitte brav verhüllen sollen, wenn sie nicht angegraben werden sollen und es selbst schuld sind, wenn sie unflätige Sprüche kassieren- und das, bloss weil frau mal Minirock trägt. Das kann es doch nicht sein! Es muss doch möglich sein, auch bei knappen Outfits, den nötigen Respekt zu waren-was Brüderle NICHT getan hat. Der Ton macht die Musik!

Patrick:

&gt;Ebenfalls sehr interessant: Wer sich oder seinen Körper präsentiert, verliert das Selbstbestimmungsrecht darüber? Oder was darfich als (überspitzte) Quintessenz aus dem Artikel mitnehmen? Wer sich zeigt, muss auch mit den aufgedrückten Konsequenzen leben?

JB:

&gt;""Nein, mein Gott, ich möchte nicht Mann sein in dieser Welt, in der bereits 13-Jährige mit Push-up-BHs zur Schule gehen. Ich möchte nicht Mann sein in einer Welt, in der man überlegen muss, ob man noch mit einer Kollegin Kaffee trinken kann."" Was soll das denn bitte bedeuten? Man möchte nicht Mann sein, wenn man Nachdenken muss, bevor man die eine Frau plump und völlig daneben anmacht? Doch! Genau das sollten Männer tun: Nachdenken bevor sie ihre Macht ausnutzen, Minderjährige anmachen und Sprüche ablassen, die eine Frau verletzen könnten (das gilt andersherum genauso). Das ist ja wohl nicht zu viel verlangt und macht das Leben im Nachgang wohl eher leichter für alle, als schwerer für die Männer! [..]
&gt;
&gt;Außerdem bedeutet, dass man sich als Frau stylt (vielleicht für den Mann, mit dem man gleich im Kino verabredet ist und nicht nur für sich selbst) doch nicht, dass man gleich zum Freiwild für alle Männer wird. [..]
&gt;
&gt;Und doch: Ich möchte in einer Welt leben, in der ""Männer vor lauter Angst, etwas Falsches zu sagen, lieber gar nichts mehr sagen"", sollte das, was sie zu sagen haben verletzend, sexistisch, respektlos und ohne jeglichen Anstand sein. 

Jo:

&gt;Punkto Rainer Brüderle oder George Clooney: stehe ich auf beide nicht, aber es macht für mich schon nen Unterschied, ob ich von einem schmucken Vertreter meiner generation oder einem 60 Jährigen mit Ring am Finger lüstern angestarrt werde, wir leben nun mal nicht mehr im Zeitalter Effi Briests; UND: aus meiner Erfahrung ist es oftmals egal ob ich im durchschimmernden Seidenblüschen oder im Blaumann durch die Straßen wackele, die Herren auf den Gerüsten pfeifen so oder so, da kann man nichts machen

Laura Ärger:

&gt;Ich finde es erschreckend, wenn dermassen pauschalisiert wird, wie hier. geplante vermischung, abschwächung, lächerlich machen eines themas wie: sexuelle belästigung am arbeitsplatz. es ging ja nicht um einen anmachversuch in der freizeit. hier spielt ein grosser teil machtgefälle rein: eine junge journalistin ist mit einem älteren, bekannten politiker konfrontiert, der offenbar keinerlei mass und respekt aufweisen kann. nein, er sollte sich nicht nur bei seiner ehefrau entschuldigen, sondern auch bei der journalistin. 
&gt;
&gt;und noch eine kritik: ob der mann, der auf bierselige art die frau zu einem sexobjekt degradiert, attraktiv ist oder nicht, spielt keine rolle, weil es gar nicht darum geht. [..] aufgrund dieser folgerungen der schreiberin des artikels kontra frauen die sich wehren, müsste man auch davon ausgehen, dass ein chef, wenn er denn gut aussieht, jederzeit sein machtgefälle ausnutzen, grenzen sprengen dürfte? die junge frau kann es sich vielleicht nicht so locker leisten vehement zu werden - im gegensatz zu einer plumpem anmache in der freizeit durch einen fremeden zb. 
&gt;
&gt;und dieses: darf denn ein mann keine komplimente mehr machen, ist eine frechheit. denn es geht hier nicht darum, sondern um all jene, die den unterschied nicht mehr sehen wollen. es gibt frauen, die machen sich gerne hübsch, ob nur für sich oder die männer rundherum, das ist doch völlig egal. jede frau darf sich doch auch für männer gerne attraktiv geben, das heisst aber nicht, dass sie deswegen zum freiwild wird, die sich alles gefallen lassen muss. 
&gt;
&gt;der aufschrei, von vielen so erneut herabwürdigend aufgenommen und ad absurdum getrieben, betrifft vielleicht sehr viele, die genau mit diesen grenzen nicht umgehen können. [..] denn es geht nicht immer um täter und opfer, um schwarz oder weiss, aber es geht um respekt und anstand, um das feingefühl darum, wo was gerade angebracht ist und wo nicht. 
&gt;
&gt;dass die frau von vielen männern quasi freundlicherweise das recht zugestanden bekommt, nein zu sagen, ist ja unheimlich grosszügig und ehrenhaft. die frau hat dies aber nicht nötig, sie soll es erwarten können und auch einfordern dürfen.

S. Uhlig:

&gt;[..] Frau Kelle, sie machen sich doch damit mehr als lächerlich. Auf der einen Seite sagen sie, das nicht alle Männer ""so"" sind, dann aber wieder das ""wir"" Frauen die (armen) Männer ja so in unserer Hand haben...Also für mich klingt das so, als ob sie die Herrenwelt nicht ernst nehmen und alle für triebgesteuerte Volltrottel halten. [..] Sie sagen auch, das jeder Frau eine andere Grenze hat, das ist sicherlich richtig, aber es muss doch wohl erlaubt sein diese Grenzen für Arbeitsverhältnisse/Abhängigkeitsverhältnisse zu diskutieren. 
&gt;
&gt;Es wird keine Frau bestreiten das der Lippenstift, das frisierten Haar und ein schickes Kleid, auch die Männerwelt nicht kalt lassen soll. Jedoch muss man hier differenzieren! 1. Handelt es sich um einen privaten Raum oder um die Arbeitsstelle? 2. Ist unsere Gesellschaft sehr Oberflächlich, ich erinnere an das Beispiel von Frau Merkel, die regelmäßig für ihr Aussehen in der Presse ""gelüncht"" wird. Soetwas gab es bei einem männlichen Bundeskanzler noch nie in diesem Ausmaß, aber das mal am Rande. Was ich mit diesem Beispiel verdeutlichen will, ist... das ein großer gesellschaftlicher Druck auf Frauen liegt, ihr Äußeres betreffend. Es reicht nicht mehr nur klug und fleißig zu sein, nein du musst auch perfekt Aussehen. Aber bloß nicht zu schön, sonst nimmt dich keiner mehr ernst... [..]
&gt;
&gt;Was genau bedeutet denn "" wie Schlampen rumlaufen"". Mich würde mal interessieren wie Sie rumlaufen, etwa wie eine Klosterschülerin?! Warum tuen sie eig. so als wäre es legitim für Georg Clooney sich so zu verhalten? Sie meint doch wohl nicht etwa weil er so hübsch ist? [..] Abgesehen davon stehen viele Frauen auf Clooney eben weil er nicht so ein uncharmantes bäuerliches Verhalten an den Tag legt, wie Herr Brüderle! 
&gt;
&gt;Am schönsten finde ich ja wie Sie für ihre sehr polemische Argumentation dann noch zu guter letzt, Formate wie ""Der Bachelor"" der bei RTL! läuft, als Argument heranzieht. Zitat: ""In einer Folge „Bachelor“ lernt man mehr über Frauen als durch 100 feministische Bücher"". Da fragt man sich doch, ist diese Frau wirklich eine investigative Journalistin? Sie haben nicht verstanden worum es geht! Alle Frauen in eine Ecke der Selbstviktimisierung zu stellen, die sich an dieser Diskussion beteiligen, ist nicht nur polemisch, sondern Verleugnung der Ernsthaftigkeit dieser Diskussion! 

Martina:

&gt;Es sind genau Artikel wie diese und Frauen wie die Verfasserin, die gesellschaftliche Zustände zementieren. Wenn sich eine Frau schön macht und einen hübschen Ausschnitt zeigt, so möchte sie NICHT, dass irgendein ungehobelter Volltrottel da hinein glotzt und/oder dumme Sprüche klopft. Es geht um ein angenehmes, mal mehr oder weniger prickelndes Miteinander. Ähnlich schön ist es, wenn ein Mann gepflegt, z. B. frisch rasiert, gut riechend und mit bewusst ausgewählter Bekleidung erscheint. [..] 
&gt;
&gt;Übrigens Frau Kelle: Die Zeiten waren doch eigentlich vorbei, in denen man meinte, Frauen seien aufgrund ihrer kurzen Röcke oder ihres tiefen Ausschnittes selbst Schuld an sexuellen Übergriffen, oder? Und noch ein zweites Übrigens: Inzwischen sehen wir anderswo, dass unter bestimmten Umständen Frauen sogar massiv Opfer sexueller Übergriffe werden, wenn sie sich von Kopf bis Fuß verhüllen...
