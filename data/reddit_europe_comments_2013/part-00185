Between 1904 and 1907 they comitted a genocide against the indigenous [Herero and Nama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_and_Namaqua_Genocide) people in Namibia. 

And thanks to my google skills, I found this litte [review](http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1268) in english on a book titled ""German Colonialism. A Short History"". A little excerpt:

""The English edition also benefits from the addition of maps, and a large number of illustrations. These provide a fascinating and often shocking visual accompaniment to the text. They include cartoons from contemporary German satirical publications, along with pictures and photographs which record, amongst other things, visual symbols of oppression like the identification tags worn by Africans in German South West Africa after 1907, or which otherwise illustrate the pitiless nature of much of German conquest. One photograph shows workers in Togo harnessed to cotton wagons in place of draft animals, which, Conrad tells us, were difficult to keep alive in the climate here. Another photograph, taken in the Omaheke desert in 1905, which captures the stares of a group of emaciated Herero, also stands out, as does a contemporary illustration of German soldiers packing the skulls of ‘hanged’ and ‘fallen’ Herero women into crates, prior to their transportation back to Germany for the research of phrenologists.""

From what I know, it wasn´t as brutal as this in the rest of the colonies, but in general it can be said that the indigenous population was always regarded as a lesser kind of man that needed it´s white master to be rescued.

true,morten_schwarzschild,null,null,"&gt; Mettere di fronte un politico alle proprie balle che cosa vuol dire? Che gli si rivolge la parola solo per ricordargli quanto è stronzo? Questo non è più giornalismo, è accanimento

Sono d'accordo. A molti piacerebbe vedere in diretta e nella realtà quel tipo di momento che si vede solo in qualche film: durante una conferenza stampa, il politico bastardo di turno viene beffato dal giornalista che di fronte alle telecamere lo incastra su una sua menzogna.

Ma questo non è il mestiere di un giornalista. Il mestiere di un giornalista è informare il pubblico, nel modo più onesto e completo possibile, di quello che succede. Se succede che un politico ha detto una balla su qualcosa di importante, le prove vanno mostrate al pubblico (in un articolo o in un servizio), non *al politico*. E infatti questa cosa in Italia viene sistematicamente fatta.

Il meccanismo, *da questo esclusivo punto di vista*, non è rotto dal lato giornalisti: le balle vengono fuori (non su tutti i giornali, ma del resto è un mito che la stampa tendenziosa esista solo qui).

Poi, il fatto che la gente voti sempre i soliti quattro stronzi dipende da altro. Raramente un politico ha perso le elezioni perché beccato a mentire in modo oggettivo; spesso anzi le menzogne che sono difficili da refutare le fanno vincere, le elezioni, in Italia come altrove.",0,1378340697,null,0,false,0,cc1wf05,t3_1lpg8v,t1_cc1wf05,t1_cc1txd3,null,1429587579,8,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,8

I don't give a damn about origins, color or credes. As long as the incoming people don't become disproportionately represented in crime and other unlawful or morally abusive practices.

It's difficult to integrate anyone when there is a mindset of prejudice, but if after a few generations, the newer generations don't adjust and are actually (in general) more radical and poorly integrated, committing more crimes than the natives and refusing to change certain practices, then there is no point in ignoring it, however unfair it may seem. The policies have to change. But those who didn't fail at integration should not be discriminated. A change in policy doesn't necessarily need to make a clean slate out of everyone. It just needs to become more enforcive and weed out the bad members. And rehabilitation shouldn't come by throwing money at the problem. 

If there is an open door to a country and said country has poorly integrated citizens, then incoming migrants will pick up those bad influences or at the very least be discriminated because of them.

true,gamberro,IREL,Éire,"The novel is a work of fiction and although Conrad had actually been to the Congo, he fell ill shortly after he reached Léopoldville (Kinshasa), meaning he never saw the worst atrocities. That's not to say that he didn't hear about them but there are better accounts out there.

*Now to answer the OP's question in a very succinct way*: the [Congo Free State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State) (the Belgian Congo would come later) was a territory created and privately controlled by the King of the Belgians, Léopold II. Léopold had hired explorers such as Stanley to help him stake his claim on the territory and if you compare the territory to the Congo basin you can see [how much he managed to get his hands on](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/CongoLualaba_watershed_plain_political.png).

The Congo basin itself is highly important strategically, stretching across the heart of the continent in a similar fashion to the Amazon. Essentially Stanley and other Europeans hoped that this could be an artery through which one could access the interior and a basin stretching over 3.7 million square kilometres. However, much to the chagrin of Stanley and Léopold, in many places the river is made impassible by rapids, [some over 100 km across](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Falls). To harness this gateway into the interior, whoever occupied the Congo had to invest in building towns, roads and railways to get around the parts where it was impassible. The huge expense that this entailed was part (and only part) of the reason why Léopold embarked on a program to force the natives to pay tax.

But Léopold himself was also inspired by Mercantilist ideas of colonies being profitable and set out to turn the Congo into the same. However, this was only possible through a regime of forced labour or a [*corvée*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corv%C3%A9e) on a large scale, which was enforced through coercion and brutal methods such as mutilation or worse. Reports by missionaries and diplomats led to an international outcry, an investigation, forced labour being suppressed and the territory being transferred to the Belgian state in 1908 (thus the beginning of the Belgian Congo). 

The death toll as a result of the forced labour regime, starvation, disease and the massive disruption the former caused has been placed in the millions (with some estimates placing it between 5 to 10). Many diseases such as sleeping sickness were spread as a result of the Congo Free State being created with movement of people exposing populations to diseases that were otherwise uncommon.

**Some suggestions for further reading**:
[*The Eyes of Another Race*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Eyes-Another-Race-Casements/dp/1900621991/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378363000&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+eyes+of+another+race+roger+casement%27s+congo+report+and+1903+diary) Roger Casement was the British Consul in the Congo during this period and was famous for a report he created for the Foreign Office into what happened there. This book contains his actual report and his diary that he kept at the time. But this is a valuable source as he visited parts of the Congo before and after forced labour was introduced. 

[*King Leopold's Ghost*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/King-Leopolds-Ghost-ebook/dp/B0050NJMKG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378363664&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=king+leopold%27s+ghost) - Adam Hochschild's work is probably the most famous popular history book on the topic. It's a good place to start if your interested in this topic.

[*The King Incorproated*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-King-Incorporated-Leopold-Second/dp/1862072906/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) - This is part biography and part account of the actions of Léopold in the Congo. It's pretty thorough and a bit more professional for my tastes than Hochschild's book.

Finally, if you'd like to see more source material, [*here is a parliamentary debate*](http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1903/may/20/congo-free-state#column_1293) on the subject. I recommend starting from the paragraph I linked to, starting with ""This House would naturally expect...""

Sto con lei un anno e qualcosa, poi mi sposto verso torino. Relazione con questa torinese breve (~3 mesi) ma intensa. MOLTO intensa. Ancora oggi credo fosse una succubus.

Fino al 2007 niente, mi accontentavo di Federica e Veronica.

Con lei mai annoiato, a letto. Dopo 5 anni le posizioni non erano mai uguali (quando hai il kamasutra dalla tua, è difficile annoiarsi). Non c'è mai avuto bisogno di ""riaccendere"" nulla, dato che 10 volte su 10, quando avevo la mia ex vicino ero arrapato come un adolescente. Però era divertente quando si vestiva da scolaretta, con tanto di calzettoni, minigonna a balze, camicetta e occhiali da zozza. Ma ha preferito un altro, a me, dopo 5 anni insieme. Tant'è.

Et l'incompréhension, qui devrait appeler la pédagogie, attire en fait la démagogie, qui pousse à aggraver les peines **en dépit de toute logique judiciaire**.

Les gens veulent qu'on appelle des trucs ""viol"" alors que la définition est restreinte et ne correspond pas à leur ressenti. Le truc, c'est que dans pas mal de cas, ça ne mérite pas de condamnation au pénal, du coup, ça ne s'appelle pas viol :

&gt; Belgian rule created more of an ethnic divide between the Tutsi and Hutu, and they supported Tutsis political power. Due to the eugenics movement in Europe and the United States, the colonial government became concerned with the differences between Hutu and Tutsi. Scientists arrived to measure skull—and thus, they believed, brain—size. Tutsi's skulls were bigger, they were taller, and their skin was lighter. As a result of this, Europeans came to believe that Tutsis had Caucasian ancestry, and were thus ""superior"" to Hutus. Each citizen was issued a racial identification card, which defined one as legally Hutu or Tutsi. The Belgians gave the majority of political control to the Tutsis. Tutsis began to believe the myth of their superior racial status, and exploited their power over the Hutu majority. In the 1920s, Belgian ethnologists analysed (measured skulls, etc.) thousands of Rwandans on analogous racial criteria, such as which would be used later by the Nazis. In 1931, an ethnic identity was officially mandated and administrative documents systematically detailed each person's ""ethnicity,"". Each Rwandan had an ethnic identity card.

For children of the 80s, it sounds absurd because we've grown up with literally no threats around, but it shouldn't be outside the bounds of imagination that there might come a day where we as a union will be forced to defend ourselves against an external threat. It's also far from inconceivable that an internal threat could arise, although I'd certainly hope that civil security forces would be able to deal with those long before military intervention is needed.

The Balkan Wars are only 15 years away. The Cold War ended only 22 years ago.

We are in a period of what we should call ""Pax Americana"" — America may be an oppressive hegemony, but their presence really does serve to secure global trade and politics in a way that everyone is forced to ""play nice"". We're not really at a point in history where anyone would trust humans to play nice without the threat of a severe scolding in the form of a nuclear ICBM if they don't, so to speak.

As for Europe, our security is assured largely by the Americans under NATO. While the forces of Britain, France, and Germany are formidable, especially when aided by smaller more specialised militaries (like the Finns, Danes, Dutch, etc.), there is no way that we could currently enforce the Western hegemony on our own, due to the terrible amount of bureaucracy and double work involved in getting our militaries coordinated in a joint effort, as well as the fact that we're spending resources 27 times that need only be spent once.

EDIT: I do agree, though, that one of the reasons that an American hegemony has been mostly tolerable (for us, at least) is that they have been representing values that are fundamentally good, like basic freedoms, human rights, and a respect for sovereignty, even if it's somewhat questionable, especially in the Middle East. I would much less enjoy to live in a world with a Chinese or Russian military hegemony, because their states are corrupt, cynical, and couldn't give a rat's ass about human rights.

The only reason to send a completely redacted document to Germany is to show that Obama isn't happy with Germany's recent criticism of the NSA. 

By publicizing that Obama sent this warning to Germany, Germany has let everyone know that US-German ties are fraying.

The alliance of the US, UK, France, and Germany has kept Russia in check since WWII.  But now, Britain has abandoned America and France will soon be busy with Syria, and the redacted document proves that Germany and the US are barely allies.  The alliance is the weakest it's ever been, and Russia knows that because of Germany's loose lips.

Russia will likely use this knowledge to launch an invasion of Europe as soon as the US and France are busy in Syria.  Britain and Germany might even ally with Russia at this point.  The only possible responses from America will be nuclear war or acceptance of a new Russian empire.

Good job, Germany.

It follows the life of one of the men who did most to uncover the abuses of the ""Congo Free State"", Roger Casement.

This said, it is important to make the difference between three periods:

a) Congo Free State: this was not a Belgian colony, but a colony of the Belgian king, his own personal possession. This was the worst period, with 5-10 million dead as King Leopold exploited the colony for his own personal economic gain. The Belgian authorities and establishment were complicit in this (Belgian army officers were easily granted leave to serve in the Free State's ""Force Publique"", and Belgian financiers bankrolled Leopold in his quest), but the Belgian state wasn't directly involved (the Belgian parliament didn't want to take charge of any colonies, and distrusted the king intensely...with very good reason).

2) Belgian Congo: After a worldwide public outcry about the abuses of the Congo Free State, King Leopold **sold** his colony to Belgium (in pretty good terms to himself). As African colonies went, this was relatively well run, but many of the same people who had run the Congo Free State remained in charge, so it still was a pretty exploitative affair. Although it was a net charge for the Belgian state, it provided some Belgian corporations and individual interests with very nice profits, on the backs of the Congolese.

3) Post-independence Congo: The decolonisation of Belgian Congo was a horrible affair, with those Belgian business interests who had profited so well from both the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo continuing to meddle in the country's affairs, bankrolling a [secessionist government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Katanga) and killing [independent Congo's first Prime Minister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba) and (according to some) [even the Secretary-General of the UN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld#Death)...",0,1378377753,null,0,1378378835,0,cc251t6,t3_1lrhjz,t1_cc251t6,t3_1lrhjz,null,1429583481,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

A dire il vero avevo già sentito parlare di Reddit, ma ogni volta non riuscivo mai a capire come funzionasse, quale fosse il suo scopo e perché avesse tanto successo, pur conoscendo e capendo (a grandi linee) 4chan.

Avrò lurkato molto poco, poi l'immancabali cacazzi che è in me si sarà iscritto probabilmente per contribuire al sistema upvote/downvote. Le prime volte devo essere stato molto First Day on Internet Kid, poi col tempo ho capito che anche questo sistema le sue falle ce l'ha.

In un primo momento mi sono innamorato di /r/cringe, /r/pettyrevenge, e /r/JusticePorn, ora li ho un po' abbandonati, forse mi hanno stufato.

In media lo visito molto spesso, è un po' come quando hai fame ma non sai cosa mangiare, quando ho voglia di distrarmi (più spesso di quanto vorrei e dovrei) vado a vedere cosa c'è in frigo. Ci sono stati però brevi periodi in cui ho smesso quasi del tutto di navigarci.

Dopo gli entusiasmi iniziali (una volta ho appena accennato a provare a discutere di religione su un thread di /r/atheism, povero illuso), dopo essermi stufato dei vari catchphrase ricorrenti ho iniziato a capire che i sub più popolati in media portano contenuti di qualità inferiori rispetto ad altri magari più selettivi, ma fin qui niente di nuovo, per cui sto esplorando altri sub più selettivi (ad esempio /r/AskAnthropology) tenendo però sempre un occhio su quelli mainstream (in senso letterale di bacino d'utenza) tipo AMA, AskReddit ecc.

Ogni tanto mi prende il pallino per certi sub che poi abbandono.

Attualmente non ho un sub che controllo con costanza a parte /r/italy, un po' vado a vedermeli in base all'umore del momento un po' vedo quello che mi capita sulla frontpage.

Dovrei navigare maggiormente tra i new, metti caso faccio un commento stupido e schizza in frontpage sai che karma, altro che leva finanziaria. No scherzo, dovrei farlo per il bene di Reddit.

edit: menzione particolare a /r/circlejerk, che ha avuto il merito di disincantarmi quanto basta su quello che gira su Reddit.

30/m/etero

Ho scoperto il sesso alla veneranda età di 21 anni, quando durante il servizio civile mi innamorai di una tipa che lavorava lì (che, all'epoca, di anni ne aveva 29). Fu ~~una delle~~ l'unica volta in cui il mio interesse è stato corrisposto da una donna. Ovviamente non poteva durare: dopo 3 mesi lasciò me e il tizio con cui già stava per mettersi con un terzo. Ero un niubbazzo del sesso, quindi non avevo pretese nè skill particolari, però lei mi piaceva un botto e anche fare sesso nella maniera più blanda possibile per me era fantastico.

Quella esperienza mi ha marchiato a vita, trasformandosi in una storia che si ripete di continuo. A cadenza tri-quadriennale incontro una qualche tipa che ha problemi col suo attuale ragazzo e si affida a me per un po' di conforto, e io, proverbialmente sfigato con le donne e incapace di svolgere il classico iter conosci/frequenta/poi si vedrà, ci casco sempre. Naturalmente, tale tipa mi molla dopo qualche settimana o mese per rimettersi con l'ex, sia perché sono una persona problematica, sia perché faccio schifo a letto.

Sono passati circa 3 anni dall'ultima volta che ho visto un pezzettino di patata. Non essendo interessante né figo, le donne non si avvicinano, ed essendo orribilmente timido nei confronti dell'altro sesso, nemmeno n+1 ettolitri di alcool nel sangue mi permettono di accennare anche un anonimo ""ciao"" ad una ragazza.

Questo non perché nessun giornale dice le cose come stanno. Al contrario: perché tutti lo dicono. I fatti quelli sono e più di tanto non li puoi alterare (ricordare sempre che in questo Paese puoi essere condannato anche se scrivi la verità). A fare la differenza è il modo di esporre i fatti, di tagliarli, di leggerli, di legarli, di contornarli eccetera. In una parola: tutto quel lavoro (intellettuale e pratico) che passa tra il momento in cui vedi la notizia cruda sull'agenzia a quello in cui mandi in stampa il prodotto lavorato. Esempio: Napolitano nomina quattro nuovi senatori a vita. Il fatto è questo, e da girarci intorno c'è poco. Dipende tutto da come lo inscatolo io. Devo fare il giornale di sinistra? Allora faccio il pezzo di cronaca con le nomine, lo sdoppio con le reazioni mettendo in risalto quelli che si spellano le mani, gli appoggio sotto un'intervista a qualche padreterno d'area che dica finalmente una fiammella di speranza nel buio della politica, gli metto vicino un commento sull'Italia migliore e via. Devo fare il giornale di destra? Allora faccio il pezzo di cronaca con le nomine, lo sdoppio con le reazioni mettendo in risalto quelli che mugugnano, gli appoggio sotto il pezzo d'archivio sulle volte che i senatori a vita hanno tenuto in piedi governi morti e senza maggioranza, gli metto un commento sulle stampelle rosse e via. Il fatto rimane esattamente lo stesso, solo che se leggi il primo giornale volti pagina con la convinzione che l'operazione sia stata bellissima e se leggi il secondo volti pagina convinto che sia stata una vigliaccata.

You can forget cloud storage as well. If you truly value privacy avoid all cloud storage. 

The only thing I recommend is riseup.net - an email for activists. When signing up you're provided to provide a good reason why you want to sign up (it's aimed at activists). I just stated I was a bit more privacy aware and wanted off the main (outlook.com/gmail) providers. 

They set my account up within the day. But I would never transfer emails of a sensitive nature across this email account unless it's encrypted. (I've taught my gf how to set up truecrypt containers so she can still email me nudes and I can send her cock pics - but if the NSA *do* crack those emails it just means we're slightly embarrassed). 

As a private communication I would not trust email without heavy encryption and even then the NSA are storing data in a Nevada desert (I guess with the eventual aim) to be able to crack certain encryption when technology advances. Even if you're email is encrypted and the NSA can't crack it you'll still be leaving meta-data of who you're contacting and what times those communications take place. In a closing society (like the US) where discussion and revelation of war crimes can have far reaching consequence email is not to be trusted. If you are someone of influence (a whistleblower/buisnessman/politician) I would advocate the use of the main providers emails almost as a spam setup (direct all ur spam/non important convos there) then riseup/you're own email server with encryption for the occasional private communication. 

Bottom line - Email is compromised so treat it as such. If you want more privacy setup you're own email server or join riseup.net but still treat it as compromised. Just be glad you're off the ""main system"" which is ~~the USG's main government database~~ gmail/hotmail/yahoo

It's actually quite possible that the current coalition won't have enough votes, even if the FDP makes it in. And they will, due to strategic CDU/CSU supporters who will ""lend"" their vote to the FDP, even though Merkel could hardly be more explicit in expressing her wish that her supporters refrain from doing that (again). It's not exactly a marriage of love for Merkel and her party, despite her claims to the contrary.

If that happens, the only realistic constellations would be Black-Red and Black-Green. Neither of the two potential partners is eager to go into a coalition with the CDU/CSU, but the Greens would face a particularly severe backlash from their base, whereas for the SPD it's mostly a strategic problem. That's why terms would have to be exceptionally good.

That said, I really wouldn't mind a Black-Green coalition, although it might be better to wait another four or eight years. The Greens would lose votes on the left, but in the long term they might make up for it with gains in the center. It would relatively strengthen the Realo wing of the party, which IMHO would be a good thing, and it would provide a counterweight to the conservatives within the government, which would also be good (although it would come at the cost of stability). 

Still, I doubt we'll see this constellation (yet).",0,1378381172,null,0,false,0,cc25ibk,t3_1lq48u,t1_cc25ibk,t1_cc24q03,null,1429583267,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

There would be a bias in the assessment of what the tweet's content really advocates, but I assume you have common sense.

First dimension, sentiment towards the EU:

- anti-EU sentiment

- pro-EU sentiment

Second dimension, collaboration categories:

- Collaboration in general

- Financial union

- Education (e.g. Erasmus Mundus)

- Military collaboration

- Immigrant policy

- Youth policy

- Subsidies

- ...

- etc.

If you can then also filter this by country, you could generate an overview of what your politicians mostly care about on a European level by showing e.g. a pie chart with number of tweets per category and you can show the sentiment towards collaboration per category.

&gt; Decision making under risk entails the anticipation of prospective outcomes, typically leading to the greater sensitivity to losses than gains known as loss aversion. Previous studies on the neural bases of choice-outcome anticipation and loss aversion provided inconsistent results, showing either bidirectional mesolimbic responses of activation for gains and deactivation for losses, or a specific amygdala involvement in processing losses. Here we focused on loss aversion with the aim to address interindividual differences in the neural bases of choice-outcome anticipation. Fifty-six healthy human participants accepted or rejected 104 mixed gambles offering equal (50%) chances of gaining or losing different amounts of money while their brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).We report both bidirectional and gain/loss-specific responses while evaluating risky gambles,with amygdala and posterior insula specifically tracking the magnitude of potential losses. At the individual level,loss aversion was reflected both in limbic fMRI responses and in gray matter volume in a structural amygdala–thalamus–striatum network, in which the volume of the “output” centromedial amygdala nuclei mediating avoidance behavior was negatively correlated with monetary performance. We conclude that outcome anticipation and ensuing loss aversion involve multiple neural systems, showingfunctional and structural individual variability directly related to the actual financial outcomes of choices. By supporting the simultaneous involvement of both appetitive and aversive processing in economic decision making,these results contributetothe interpretation of existing inconsistencies onthe neural bases of anticipating choice outcomes.

&gt;Chance for Success, Transitions and Alignment, School Finance

I don't know if these are quite valid indicators for the topic at hand, but it made the conversation a lot more interesting.

I couldn't find the PISA score ranking for all individual states, which could have painted a better picture. Another thing that should be taken into consideration is the amount and quality of degrees people hold. A genuine surprise was the low performance of WA though. I'm certainly a little biased having lived in Seattle and forming a picture of a fairly well informed population there. California as well, but Cali is a populous state with high income disparity I suppose. Most of the statistic and analysis I browsed seems to concentrate on policy, maybe due to vast heterogeneity among state education policies and institutions which makes straight comparison problematic. Obviously there are a lot of factors that determine education success by region but I still argue that these factors deem to concentrate geographically. Recurring trends among all reports seem to be high performance in the North East and low in Mid South. That being said the state level still seems too broad of a metric for this. As a result of this argument I still argue my initial point of geographical relation to individual's likeliness to be educated/ informed/ broad minded. However, now I'm way more skeptic towards West Coast educational prowess. Luckily I myself attended a fair public school there: Redmond High. Unarguably a well to do place, a high tech cluster in its own right. 

I found this; don't know about its scientific validity:

And this but it seems again a broad, policy oriented analysis:

Actually, not so much. Real Madrid's biggest creditor by far is [Bankia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankia), the biggest bailed-out [caja](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bank_%28Spain%29) and particularly [notorious](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/04/bankia-board-investigation-corruption-claims) for political interference in its board. Real Madrid also owes an [undisclosed but probably humongous amount of money in back taxes](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/how-tax-break-gives-real-madrid-and-barcelona-an-unfair-edge-8749146.html).

And BTW, Real Madrid's president, Florentino Pérez, also happens to be CEO of ACS, a hugely indebted construction firm which [pretty much epitomizes the current crisis](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/business/global/in-spain-grupo-acss-high-debt-reflects-countrys-finances.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1378386587-sXzgfiM2hZuASQScyQkbcQ). Of course, one of ACS' biggest creditors is also...Bankia.

In short, if somebody was to obliterate Real Madrid (and FC Barcelona, for good measure) from the face of the Earth, it would be a huge favour to Spain as a whole.

I really would like to understand a specific negative effect that overweight the potential benefits. The only one that is valid is **the potential** ecological damage.

Or maybe the increase in GDP wasn't larger than the increase in population?

Sure, they can sell insurance and other services but the core of their activity is lending money of their depositors to people who need capital to make investments - so if you say rich people put their money in the bank then you must also acknowledge that their money is being invested and circulating back into the economy.

Dunque. La logica che manda avanti tutto è, in quanto tale, risultato della sinergia di tante sotto-logiche complementari. C'è la sottologica commerciale (che sono sicuro che ti mette tristezza solo perché qualcuno ti ha insegnato che commerciale è una brutta parola, tipo quando i Metallica erano diventati commerciali. Prova a chiamarla logica industriale, guarda come ti diventa subito più seria): questa sottologica si basa sul fatto che quello che fai deve generare ricavi, sennò arriva un bel momento in cui devi smettere di farlo. E siccome carmina non dant panem nessuno può permettersi di non tenerlo in considerazione. Poi c'è la sottologica ideale: in comune con la comunità di chi ti legge hai una visione del mondo, una linea, un sistema di idee. Per questo sarà nel tuo interesse perseguire queste cose, magari dando loro forma ed aggiornandole mano a mano che il mondo si aggiorna, ma di tanto da queste non potrai mai allontanarti. Poi c'è la logica interna: come in ogni settore, quello che fai tu dipende in maniera molto stretta da quello che fanno gli altri (il che vale per i ragionamenti sui destini del mondo come per i ricettari a dispense da allegare). A seconda delle contingenze, ulteriori sotto-logiche possono avere un ruolo.

Sure, the main problem in the Euro area, in my opinion, is too much debt, the fall in value of the collateral used, too much leverage, and imbalances in terms of competitiveness.  
  
QE would help quite a bit solving all those problems, it would help states not having to save their banks which ruin their public finances, it would help banks to start loaning again at a lower interest rate, it would help bridge the competitiveness gap in the periphery which would have lower inflation than Germany due to the austerity measures, it would help homeowners who have their house as collateral.  
  
The way I see it, it would help pretty much every thing. The effects can be seen in the US and in the UK which are quite a lot better than they could have been had they not done this.

You'll have to forgive me but so do you straw-manning me, dodging the issue and talking about QE as if it was a solution.

&gt;Sure, the main problem in the Euro area, in my opinion, is too much debt, the fall in value of the collateral used, too much leverage, and imbalances in terms of competitiveness. 

I was under the impression that your problem was with the debt in the first places, the austerity cuts it requires and the unemployment from the higher taxes and the fall in demand due to the uncertainty.

Because if you were to say QE was a solution to this, I'd tell you that the debt would remain high if there wasn't a cut in public spending, that unemployment would remain high because there would still be uncertainty and the velocity of circulation would continue to decrease and that on top of this you'd have an higher level of inflation eating away at the purchasing power of those who are worse off (while the financial system would be just dandy as they can hedge against inflation without any issue and they'd be the ones getting the seigniorage gains).. fortunately you're just saying QE is good for the financial sector, right?

&gt;it would help states not having to save their banks which ruin their public finances

At the end of the day, if your choice is between saving a bank with taxpayers' money or with money fresh from the printing presses, it's quite the same for everybody else, everybody will lose purchasing power, if not for taxation it will be for inflation.

&gt;it would help banks to start loaning again at a lower interest rate

You must first also deal with the uncertainty and for that you need actual measures that the economy will improve, simple ""good-feeling animal spirits"" won't cut it, you need actual reforms, not mere speculation, otherwise the velocity of circulation will simply continue to fall as people will continue to save and be reluctant to invest.

Not to mention that inflation in and of itself increases nominal interest rates.

&gt;it would help bridge the competitiveness gap in the periphery which would have lower inflation than Germany due to the austerity measures

That's a problem of taxation, the effectiveness of public spending and of the liberalisation of the market, not a monetary phenomenon as the currency is the same.

&gt;The effects can be seen in the US and in the UK which are quite a lot better than they could have been had they not done this.

[On average](http://fxtop.com/en/historical-exchange-rates.php?MA=1), in 2003 with 1 EUR you could purchase 0.692 GBP or 1.131 USD, in 2013 you can with 1 EUR purchase 0.853 GBP or 	1.315 USD.. the Euro has been the stronger currency, compared to the Brits or the Yankees, we have improved our purchasing power.

It means that you will definitely retain a huge amount of links with the country you were previously part of.

There's actually a movement who advocate for the breaking down of larger EU member states like Germany, Spain and the UK into their constituent parts because being a big block isn't particularly helpful to them anymore (or wont be, in the vision of this movement) and would make representation within the EU more fair.

&gt; That's a problem of taxation, the effectiveness of public spending and of the liberalisation of the market, not a monetary phenomenon as the currency is the same.  
  

No, it's not just a problem of taxation, there is a bunch of other factors involved, including wages which this would help with, doing so with quite a lot less pain than internal devaluation is doing since, as you say, the currency is the same, and if we are doing austerity our inflation would be lower than Germany.

In other words, any sufficiently large service which operates worldwide and on a profit motive is forced to spy on you, whether they want to or not.

If you're really concerned about your privacy, and you want to keep using email and cloud storage, then your best option is to actually buy a permanent IP address from your ISP and set up your own, heavily encrypted server at home. It's a bit more technical and obviously expensive, but that's literally the only way you can ensure no one but yourself has access to your data (provided you ensure the server is hack-proof as well of course).

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Are you sure you're not a gold bug? You keep saying you're not, but you argue like one. 

Nope, I'm not a supporter of the gold standard, tbh I think it's silly to peg your currency to a commodity such as gold which can fluctuate randomly (which may lead to random spikes of deflation or inflation) and where the seigniorage gains are all concentrated on the hands of those who happen to be sitting on the new reserves of the metal.

Either way, how is this relevant to the argument?

&gt;Well QE pretty much does that, it gives quite a lot of confidence that the economy will improve and that the collateral you accept from your debtors will be sound. 

Then why is that the velocity of circulation is at an all time low in the USA? Their FED has kept interest rates at 0% for the longest time and they've had plenty of QE and yet there's just not confidence that things will improve in the near future?

&gt;No, it's not just a problem of taxation, there is a bunch of other factors involved, including wages which this would help with, doing so with quite a lot less pain than internal devaluation is doing since

So basically you're saying that the Portuguese workers should keep their nominal wages as is and expand the money supply so their real wages were cut?

&gt;the currency is the same, and if we are doing austerity our inflation would be lower than Germany. 

Inflation is a monetary phenomenon, if the ECB were to engage in QE then both countries would experience inflation. As for austerity, it wouldn't be an issue if the cuts in public spending were at the same time cuts in taxation, though there's more to it than this, there's the public deficits and there's the interest rates on the public debt.

&gt;In fact, that's how Germany got to be so competitive in the first place, by doing austerity while the others weren't doing it.

A more accurate description would be that Germany is now more competitive in comparison to say Portugal because they never were fiscally reckless in the first place.

&gt;Doing so, they steadily made their wages lower relative to the other Eurozone countries. 

Wages may be somewhat sticky but they're still very flexible (if labour legislation forbids this then the market adjusts not through the price of labour but by the quantity of labour, aka the explanation for the unemployment in countries with more restrictive labour laws), so that's not an explanation, the German worker is paid that which he's owed, proof of this is that their unemployment rate isn't very high nor is it very low.

&gt;Have we? Not so much for the Europeans who no longer have a job, not so much for the Europeans who went bankrupt, they have lost quite a bit of purchasing power.

In the same time, the Brits and the Yankees have gone through the same, in some situations worse than those in the Euro area.

O gente che sta insieme 20 anni, poi lui va in vacanza ai caraibi con i suoi amici e torna indietro sposato. E lascia quella con cui è stato prima della vacanza.

O più normalmente -considerando la mia fascia d'età- gente che è troppo occupata a rincoglionirsi con alcoolici e/o stupefacenti di maggior o minore intensità per cercarsi una ragazza.

Le ragazze decenti sono tutte nella prima categoria (sposate o ultrafidanzate). Le ciospe sono delle zoccole immonde, ma piuttosto che allungargli la fava mi do al monachesimo.

Le nuove leve, parte femminile, stan venendo su bene. Fin troppo. L'altra sera in pizzeria è entrata una ragazzina che a occhio avrà avuto 13-14 anni. Hotpants. Canottina semitrasparente attillata. Pushup senza spalline. Mi ha fissato da che s'è seduta a quando me ne sono andato. Quando incrociavo lo sguardo non faceva neanche finta di guardare da un'altra parte. Solo fissava e sorrideva. E io sentivo la mano dei carabinieri sulla mia spalla, quindi tornavo a concentrarmi sulla birra rossa che avevo davanti.

Le nuove leve, parte maschile, stan venendo su come quelli che hai descritto. Ignoranti, futuri clienti di san patrignano, senza la minima voglia di fare un cazzo (lavorare o studiare che sia). E le ragazze che sbavano dietro a sti bellocci col capello impomatato.

Quindi no. Dalle mie zone niente bukkake party, niente amiche che mi chiamano un sabato sera chiedendomi se mi va di farmi puppare la fava, niente megarisse, anche perché le persone qui sono molto coese, se uno da fuori minaccia qualcuno del paesino, tutta la popolazione over12 e under40 si schiera a favore.

Also , I agree with you that the smaller a country is the better it is administrated. Scotland being a good example, Catalonia too. Descentralization is a good thing when it comes to governance. However, the EU is not a federation where states have a say equally. It's a confederation where national states have a say , and it's a very disproportionate system, at least for the moment. 

If Moldova joined Romania, then it would benefit enormously from being part of both Romania and EU , but at the same time , Romania would get a bigger say in EU affairs.

Common markets and monetary unions can exert a lot of power and influence in the world. The one thing you need to make these unions effective in this way is a large population.

Compare that with 500M EU (and still expanding), 350M US, 1B China, 1B India, etc.

Basically Putin is terrified of the day when the EU can start to dictate terms to them instead of the other way around. The EU could decide to cut off imports from Russia to get better oil prices (an extremely unlikely example, but the principle still stands).

Joining the EU isn't an option for them because then they dilute the influence they have now. So their solution has to be to create an economic union that they control. So of course, he's doing everything he can possibly do to bring people into this union because he knows what's at stake. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), they are trying to strong-arm countries into it, and too many people still remember the Soviets to be able to overlook that.

Long term, this also affects defense policy and security since a large economy is better able to defend itself.

Anyway, your data: [Look at page 15 of this report](http://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Studien/Studien_The_systemic_crisis_web.pdf) for evidence of Germany keeping its wages stagnant while productivity increased.

It's better than having losses, which is precisely what they're afraid of. Your whole point was that money in the bank automatically translates to investment, which is not true. Maybe if we had a higher inflation rate, there would be enough incentive to stop hoarding and start investing, but who knows, really.

true,EwoutDVP,null,null,"Hm, I think you are partly right about the reason why a central bank was installed... but not really. AFAIK it was indeed contended that a central authority was needed to manage the money supply, because different banks were fucking around to much leading to mutual distrust and a downwards spiral ending in banks going bust and people losing their savings. 

(Now, if a bank collapses, it will just get bailed out. Hurray for the central banking system!)

The thing with bitcoin is that no individual - local banks nor a central bank - can fuck around with the money supply. It's embedded in the code.

You make it seem like bitcoin would be like taking a step back, I don't think it would be a step back at all. It's either a step forward, or a experiment that will turn out flawed. In either case it's hardly like anything we have ever tried before. (It probably resembles gold closer than anything else, and gold has been around for thousands of years. If only there was a way to cut gold in an infinite number of pieces and send it to the other side of the world within seconds...)

And even with a central banking system hyperinflation can happen - and has happened in several countries. The Weimar Republic and Zimbabwe are obvious examples, and it's even kind of happening in both India and Argentina right now.

I'm not sure why prices would fluctuate so heavily if bitcoin would be the only currency. In fact, I don't think that that would happen at all. Why would it? Don't price fluctuations happen relative to other currencies and commodities in particular? This couldn't possibly happen if bitcoin is the only one...

Anyways, and moreover, this is all totally besides the point. We're not talking about changing the economic system here, we're talking about subverting PayPal blockades.

as for the avarage pay i dont know how that compares in every field of work, but since münster is a town with a lot of white collar workers its called the ""desk of westphalia"" der schreibtisch westfalens. and those jobs usually pay well. there isnt much industry but where i work they pay less then the ""tarif"" but that doesnt mean much... barely any company anywhere in germany pays tarif anymore.

Just imagine a circular pipe system that has a very small hole that leaks water. At a certain point, there will no be any water in the pipes.

I'm not really informed on the spark that set aflame the entire forest, even being from Algeciras (colliding population along with Los Barrios, San Roque and La Linea), but I do know that many fishermen had to stop working because of the bricks the Gibraltar goverment ordered to be thrown into the bay, because it would break their nets, very expensive material.

true,kaaz54,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Were the Faroes standing alone in this?

The Danish opinion and actions of this matter is fairly schizophrenic to say the least:

Within the EU, Denmark agrees with the EU that the quotas are set at the correct level to retain sustainable fishing, although redistribution of the quotas can always be renegotiated to some sort. 

That being said, the Danish ministerial action so far has been to lead the case on behalf and in support of the Faroe Islands, being alone in the matter in the EU (one other Eastern European country, I think Romania but I'm most likely mis-remembering here, has supported Denmark's official action to increase Faroe Islands' quota). So inside the EU, Denmark is outnumbered something like 2-26. 

This is more complicated by the fact, that Denmark itself is, by tonnage, one of the largest fishing countries in Europe (back in 2006 it was only surpassed by Spain), but will not in a million years cede any of it's own quotas to the Faroes. This is because of several internal issues: the Danish fishing navy, while large, is in very bad financial shape. On top of that, most of the fishing jobs in Denmark are held in the outskirts areas, and that might re-ignite the internal debate in Denmark, where it is mentioned that the urban parts of Denmark are sacrificing the outskirts regions for their own gain. 

So, while the Danish civil servant parts of the government (an important part of internal EU negotiating) is ordered to work fully for the Faroese cause, the Danish politicians themselves will do everything in their power not to get anywhere near this, as they are desperately trying to manage their responsibilities towards the Faroes, but also have ambitions within the EU that could be halted by any pro-Faroe actions.

On top of that, seen from an internal EU standpoint, the civil servants working within the EU, who are Danish by nationality but not employed by Denmark, often deal with Norway, Iceland and The Faroes in negotiating the quotas. While they might be more inclined to be supportive of them, they are to put it mildly, very fed up with the representatives from these countries, and out of spite often halt negotiations as a technique, as they think that the Norwegian, Faroese and Icelandic claims are outrageous, unrealistic and ridiculous. I don't have any official sources from this, but my father has worked within that sector of the EU for 7 years, before he simply got so fed up with it, and left to another position in the EU, that he called ""less frustrating""; the Euro area in 2009.

&gt; And to be honest, I'm more worried this than I am about prices. Most people have lots of trouble meeting people who aren't natives :/

Estimating a price per day would be difficult. It depends on if you are doing the exploring all by yourself or if you go on tours. Actually cooking your own food is a good call, as eating out is very expensive. Be aware however that food can be expensive even at grocery stores. 

Prices on public transport can differ a lot. If you want to see the most of the country you have to go by plane. A great deal is to buy the [Widerøe explore Norway ticket.] (http://www.wideroe.no/en/tickets/explore-norway-ticket) If you are travelling locally there are plenty of options, atleast south if Trondheim. Between the large cities in the south there are both train and bus connections. If you want to see the scenery (which i assume) this is the best option. Train tickets can if booked in advance, cost as little as $33. 

I don't know the prices on hostels, but they are a good choice because hotels can easily set you back 130 dollars per night. I would assume hotels give you atleast half the price.

If you do cook the food yourself i could see around 100-160 dollars per day being realistic. If you want to know the price of a specific item or food, i can try to find it out for you.

&gt; And to be honest, I'm more worried this than I am about prices. Most people have lots of trouble meeting people who aren't natives :/

Well, if you are travelling you are most likely not going to be interracting with the natives as much. That being said small talk is pretty much non-existent. We do love tourists though and if you have any questions most norwegians will be happy to answer them for you. Almost every norwegian speaks great english, so it shouldn't be a problem. To be even more liked, make sure to compliment something about our country, we love to hear what foreigners think! :)
If you really want to get to know the natives, go somewhere with alcohol. That's where we open up. Another good thing for you is that your american accent get's the ladies ;)

Combine that with Russia's impotence to influence events and governments around it such as the bombing of Kosovo, and you see why they want to expand this so much.

Living standards are a social variable and have no clear definition. At best, I would say it is measurable by average disposable income, From a western perspective, that sounds about right. This indicator can be influenced by 2 general factors: 
- average income; which is influenced by GDP (actually they are correlated, both rise in capitalist economic growth)
- average living costs; that is influenced by a lot of factors, social policies, currency ratios, national deficits and commercial balance sheets (exp/inp)

Yes, there's always been conspiracy theories that the NSA has been able to decrypt some of this tech, and that backdoors have been built in by way of agents (saboteurs), but that was generally considered tinfoil hat stuff. To see it confirmed via Snowden is absolutely stunning. Also telling - they put the risk on *us* finding out about this as moderately low, and a higher risk on damaging ""industry relationships"". They're more worried companies are going to freak than we are, most likely because people don't have a damn clue how important this is.

Any back door, any weakness, isn't going to just be exploited by the government. By the sounds of it, I reckon most of the US government doesn't even know what they're capable of. (Sen. Wyden, on the Senate intelligence committee that actually knows *some* of this stuff has said what we've found out so far is just the tip of the iceberg.) Given enough time, there's a good chance some smart hackers will figure it out as well. This is terrifying news. It's extremely clear now that the 5 eyes (US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) have gone deep into the danger zone.

No, that's not how it works. If you don't take out loans, you don't have to pay interest. Also you can't pay with money that wasn't created/in existence, because it has to exist for you to be able to pay with it.

true,sayheykid24,UNSA,United States of America,"French, British, and American intelligence all basically say the same thing: Assad's regime is solely responsible for the massacre. Even if the rebels had somehow gained access to chemical weapons they don't have the sophisticated technology it takes to weaponize them, and deliver them to the site of the massacre in the manner they were delivered. Also, French intelligence indicated that Assad bombed the site of the massacre continuously in the days after the chemical attack to destroy evidence (as an aside, why would Assad and the rebels be bombing the same group of civilians?), and did everything they could to delay UN weapons inspectors from reaching the site.

When Kerry, the French, and British talked about a ""high degree of certainty"" they mean that they are 99% positive Assad is responsible. They don't have video or audio of him ordering the attack, but if this were a trial in the U.S. it would be an open and close case- they are sure well beyond any reasonable doubt that the Assad regime is responsible for the attacks. 

That being said, and despite all that evidence, I think being against any strike is a perfectly justifiable opinion that doesn't have to rest on whether Assad or the rebels launched the chemical attack. We're all a little war weary. 

&gt; If Assad did use chemical weapons it should be up to the International Community to enforce the ban.

Unfortunately the U.S. and our partner- France- are the only countries capable or willing to enforce the chemical weapons ban. At the end of the day the U.S. is the most powerful country in the world, and along with our post WWII partners, France and Britain, we are architects and defenders of the international system.

Like I said, ""we"" collectively pay out loans, meaning if not you, someone else is in debt and uses your money to pay them plus interests, so every product you buy has its price defined by costs which encompass loans plus interests. So every time you spend money your money is going to pay interests for someone somewhere down the line of production of what you bought.

&gt;  you can't pay with money that wasn't created/in existence, because it has to exist for you to be able to pay with it

That's not at all what I said. I said that interests don't correspond to any existing money. Of course, we pay interests with existing money, that's exactly the problem with interests. Banks are asking us to pay them a sum of money that doesn't exist, so whenever we pay interests we're taking money out of production value directly to the bank's revenue

Through interests, banks make us all poorer and our money less valuable. Capitalism can exist without banks having any profit (therefore their revenue wouldn't be based on interests). That would solve this devaluation problem. In fact, bank profits can only exist with interests and interests devalue money so in order to continue getting profits banks need more interests.

Of course not. The point is that PayPal is so ""easy"" only because people had to get a debit card and learn how to use it for other things. They did it once and forgot how hard it was.

This is an important distinction, because people say that Bitcoin is hard to use like it is some kind of flaw with Bitcoin. While in fact it is a matter of familiarity: they are already familiar with debit cards and whatnot, but not familiar with Bitcoin.

&gt; Or even that anyone but your dad's ass-backwards shitty bank blocks internet payments by default?

That's a normal practice here in Ukraine. :(

&gt; If not, then why are you even making that argument? If so, just how out of touch are you?

People who do PayPal payments routinely probably don't know that in some countries (which do not have thriving e-commerce infrastructure) it might be easier to pay with Bitcoin than to set up PayPal.

&gt; PayPal can function as a payment processor using credit card or direct debit 

I know, but it isn't what OP was talking about... If you use PayPal as a credit card payment processor, then it isn't different from any other payment processor, and effectively it is a feature of a credit card.

&gt;  There's magnitudes more people who have that already than would ever consider setting up something obscure like a Bitcoin wallet.

This makes me sad :( I mean sure the fjords are worth seeing, but really, how much of a culture can you absorb without interacting with natives? That is the whole reason we travel! Talk with different people, absorb the scenery, eat the food... Not even places like Bergen or Oslo? :( I want to be totally immersed in a culture if I'm going to use my only 2 weeks vacation to go!!!

&gt;Another good thing for you is that your american accent get's the ladies ;)

Like no fooling this is not a myth? You got any 'Murican friends? Do they do alright with the lovely viking ladies? I'd be lying if I said I haven't fantasized about some beautiful norwegian babes feeling my muscles in a bar ;)

There was a girl at my gym who was a KNOCKOUT. I mean, easily the most beautiful girl I've seen in my town. I was thinking to myself ""goddamn, American women sure can get beautiful."" Turns out she was a Norwegian foreign exchange student. I was like ""GODDAMMIT GO FIGURE YOU BEAUTIFUL FUCKING VIKINGS""

true,Afirejar,GERM,Germany,"&gt;I know, but it isn't what OP was talking about... If you use PayPal as a credit card payment processor, then it isn't different from any other payment processor, and effectively it is a feature of a credit card.

Yes, it is. OP is talking about using PayPal to receive payments. PayPal is popular for that, because anyone can set it up easily and lots of people are willing to use it to make payments. This is in stark contrast to BitCoin, which also can be set up relatively easily, but barely anyone uses to make payments. If a customer wants to pay and you're using BitCoin, he has to set up his own wallet and buy BitCoins from somewhere else first. If a customer wants to pay and you're using PayPal, he has to have a credit card or a bank account.

You have to make it easy for people to pay you, not complicated. Setting up a Bitcoin wallet and buying Bitcoins *is* complicated. Like almost everyone, I have a bank account. Like most people, I have a credit card. Like almost everyone, I don't have bitcoins. You're not a unique little snowflake. If you're making me jump through hoops, I will give my money to someone who doesn't.

&gt; Nobody doubts that, but ""it sucks because it isn't popular, it isn't popular because it sucks"" isn't a good argument...

Yes, it is. Having people give you money is the only reason for having a payment processor. If people won't use it, it's worthless.

&gt;It is classic chicken-and-egg situation, which pretty much every new technology faces, and each successful technology finds a way through it. You shouldn't focus on it when you discuss merits of technology because it's rather boring.

Bullshit. When discussing payment methods, there is one thing that trumps absolutely everything else, and that thing is **""do I actually receive payments with this""** because that's literally the only reason for talking about this topic. Not only should you focus on this aspect, but you **have** to focus on it, because otherwise you're completely missing the point.

Bitcoin is currently not in a state, where it can be used as the only payment method for anything but hobbyists and the most niche businesses. PayPal is.

true,morten_schwarzschild,ITAL,Italy,"Btw, quick recap of what shadow banking is.

Traditional banking is a *heavily* regulated business. There are strict requirements for banking institutions regarding what they can do with their money and what kind of information they have to report to regulatory agencies. Compared to other industries, banking is really tightly regulated.

Enter the shadow banking system. It's composed of various entities - funds, private equity firms, various types of investment vehicles - that do a lot of the same things as banks (like lend money to people, edge against risk, deal in mortgages) but they use different contractual forms (for example, derivatives) that don't fall under banking regulations. They don't fall under banking regulations because when those regulations were written these kinds of instruments didn't exist.

Through the shadow banking system, financial operators can do a lot of things that they either can't do normally or that they can't do as easily with normal banking. ""Shadow"" doesn't mean that it's run by the mafia or the illuminati, it means that it's not subject to the same very strict regulatory requirements of normal banks (especially the same governmental oversight) and thus operates ""in the shadow"".",0,1378427489,null,0,false,0,cc2leeg,t3_1lsnxo,t1_cc2leeg,t3_1lsnxo,null,1429575768,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

I've read about that. I used to live in China where that's pretty normal for people from the country to do the same thing, but within China. When people go to the city to work in a factory or whatever, they can't bring their kids due to laws governing internal migration, so the kids get left in the village with their grandparents (or no one) and see their parents once a year.

2) It's not ""criticism"" when the person in question is notorious for his constant bashing of the UK and its history. When the comments are nonsensical, they cease to be genuine ""criticism"" and instead we must question the motivation as to why they make these comments. That's all I am doing.

Adding a suggestion that maybe you shouldn't **constantly** run your adopted home country down when the alternative was a Somalian warzone is not in any way bigoted (as you are rather pathetically insinuating here).
