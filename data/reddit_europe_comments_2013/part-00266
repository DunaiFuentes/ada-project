true,kinmix,LATV,Latvia,"&gt;If it's Russia that's threatening the Ukraine not to sign that's stopping them, what exactly are they afraid of?

In order to avoid an issue with re-import Russia is threatening to void a free trade agreement with Ukraine if Ukraine would sign free trade agreement with EU. According to the current Ukrainian government it would end up costing Ukraine up to 300 billion over the next few years. (This figure is unlikely to be accurate, however I haven't seen any other information anywhere). 

So Ukraine faces a purely economical threat, however it's became so politicized that no one even mentions it. It's quite damning that instead of demanding hard figures and reports some people prefer to fight police and destroy monuments.



&gt;Whilst typing this I've remembered Russian gas goes through the Ukraine to Europe so I'm guessing that's a card Russia would play. 

No, Russia need Ukraine to transit gas to EU as much as Ukraine needs Russia's gas. So there is no gas card to play. If Ukraine is not stupid enough to start stealing gas again or not paying for it then they have nothing to worry about.

E a me, soprattutto considerando che si tratta di un amministratore con la privatizzazione facile, appare evidente come Renzi sia apertamente ostile al mondo dei sindacati.
E, per citare uno che ieri ha perso, il PD dovrebbe essere la sinistra, non la faccia buona della destra.

Sì, mi dà fastidio se il capo di un'area di centrosinistra si occupa di imprenditori. Credo tu abbia le idee confuse su cosa significhi ""sinistra"", altrimenti non mi citeresti Obama, te lo dico senza arroganza.

Di lavoro in queste primarie ha parlato solo Cuperlo, è un argomento demodé e per Renzi è stato sempre una roba trascurabile, visto che flirta con ambienti principalmente finanziari ed imprenditoriali.

Essere di sinistra significa principalmente stare dalla parte dei più deboli, vent'anni di berlusconi e lega ci hanno convinto che imprenditori e operai devono stare insieme, e fare la guerra o a chi è più povero di loro, immigrati in testa, oppure a entità indefinibili e che rimangono vaghe (l'europa, il fisco, i tecnocrati).
è colpa di questa visione se siamo come siamo ora, con le guerre tra poveri e la politica fatta a colpi di indignazione.
Ci farebbe bene ribadire che sono gli imprenditori il problema principale di questo paese, che negli ultimi decenni hanno evaso, portato la produzione fuori, scordato il benessere degli operai, votato chi gli condonava il capannone e gli toglieva le tasse.
Il fatto che ora siano loro da tutelare è propaganda di destra, e ora propaganda di Renzi.

Parlavo di Firenze, è sindaco lì, mica in Toscana. Lì ha la base elettorale tipica della sinistra in rivolta. I commercianti pensano sia un grandissimo sindaco. Situazione tipica delle amministrazioni di destra (qui a Bologna abbiamo avuto la stessa cosa con Guazzaloca).

Mediocre uomo di marketing lo è perché usa un armamentario che è lo stesso di Berlusconi, ha l'orologio fermo agli anni '80. Convention all'americana, cieli azzurri, la retorica del ""sogno"", le diete, le scenografie casalinghe curate (avete visto che cambia foto sulla libreria a seconda della trasmissione in cui è ospite?).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Hai preso una dichiarazione su parecchie che Renzi ha fatto contro i sindacati in generale e la CGIL in particolare. E a me, soprattutto considerando che si tratta di un amministratore con la privatizzazione facile, appare evidente come Renzi sia apertamente ostile al mondo dei sindacati. E, per citare uno che ieri ha perso, il PD dovrebbe essere la sinistra, non la faccia buona della destra.

ma ti ripeto, ne stai facendo una questione di schieramenti di guerra che non ha alcun senso. renzi ha sempre detto che i sindacati non sono un ente inattaccabile e che verranno riformati parallelamente ai tagli della politica. che poi i sindacati, come dice bonzinip, non godano di grande fiducia è un altro segnale che ci sia qualcosa da fare.

&gt; Sì, mi da fastidio se il capo di un'area di centrosinistra si occupa di imprenditori. Credo tu abbia le idee confuse su cosa significhi ""sinistra"", altrimenti non mi citeresti Obama, te lo dico senza arroganza.
Di lavoro in queste primarie ha parlato solo Cuperlo, è un argomento demodé e per Renzi è stato sempre una roba trascurabile, visto che flirta con ambienti principalmente finanziari ed imprenditoriali.
Essere di sinistra significa principalmente stare dalla parte dei più deboli, vent'anni di berlusconi e lega ci hanno convinto che imprenditori e operai devono stare insieme, e fare la guerra o a chi è più povero di loro, immigrati in testa, oppure a entità indefinibili e che rimangono vaghe (l'europa, il fisco, i tecnocrati). è colpa di questa visione se siamo come siamo ora, con le guerre tra poveri e la politica fatta a colpi di indignazione. Ci farebbe bene ribadire che sono gli imprenditori il problema principale di questo paese, che negli ultimi decenni hanno evaso, portato la produzione fuori, scordato il benessere degli operai, votato chi gli condonava il capannone e gli toglieva le tasse. Il fatto che ora siano loro da tutelare è propaganda di destra, e ora propaganda di Renzi.

per quanto riguarda obama sapevo già avresti fatto questa precisazione (speravo di no). lui è il modello di renzi, è chiaro, ed è di sinistra. vedi l'obamacare, vedi i lavori sul walfare, vedi i lavori sui pari diritti. se renzi fosse anche una copia di obama sarei già abbastanza soddisfatto, considerando la situazione italiana. la sinistra nel 2013 è quella di obama, eh (poi diversa da paese in paese, chiaramente. non vorrei mai vivere nel sistema america)
sui lavoratori, come ti ripeto renzi ne ha parlato e ha sottolineato i vari discorsi su meritocrazia (che secondo te sarà sicuramente una cosa orribile che mozza le gambe agli operai), semplificazione per dare e trovare lavoro, meno tasse. ha specificato anche di NON essere contro il il ricco, ma al contrario di volersi occupare della felicità del povero, che mi sembra l'unica strada percorribile dall'italia oggi. occuparsi d'imprenditori è necessario perché sono coloro che creano ricchezza e che muovono il mercato, renzi ha parlato spesso di piccola e media impresa e penso sia giustissimo. far evolvere il paese pensando di andare avanti a diritti per i lavoratori è una follia (comunque importanti, comunque trattati da renzi in molti casi).

&gt; Parlavo di Firenze, è sindaco lì, mica in Toscana. Lì ha la base elettorale tipica della sinistra in rivolta. I commercianti pensano sia un grandissimo sindaco. Situazione tipica delle amministrazioni di destra (qui a Bologna abbiamo avuto la stessa cosa con Guazzaloca).

eh, allora immagino che a firenze abbia lo 0%. eddai. se avesse lavorato male avrebbe preso pochi voti, mi pare chiaro. chi l'ha votato è sia il commerciante che l'uomo di sinistra militante. che poi questo sia giusto o sbagliato è un giudizio a posteriori. fra l'altro sarebbe interessante sentire un parere neutro di un fiorentino

&gt; Mediocre uomo di marketing lo è perché usa un armamentario che è lo stesso di Berlusconi, ha l'orologio fermo agli anni '80. Convention all'americana, cieli azzurri, la retorica del ""sogno"", le diete, le scenografie casalinghe curate (avete visto che cambia foto sulla libreria a seconda della trasmissione in cui è ospite?). Sì, prende il 70% tra i giovani perché siamo un paese ancora anni '80, servirebbe un bravo comunicatore che ci traghettasse più in là. Ma invece avremo Renzi.

boh, come dicevo l'estetica renziana da fastidio pure a me, ma non ci vedo assolutamente gli anni 80, mi pare al contrario l'alternativa più contemporanea che abbiamo oggi in politica. i suoi discorsi sono figli dell'oggi, che poi per questo diano fastidio è un giudizio che anche qui dipende dal tuo o dal mio pensiero. io penso che nel parlare di sogni non ci sia nulla di sbagliato, ad esempio. del resto si potrebbero dire molte cose ma concludo qui aspettando la tua risposta",0,1386584604,null,0,false,0,cdxbpg7,t3_1sekad,t1_cdxbpg7,t1_cdxbfv7,null,1428328973,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

La dernière fois c'était la Gestapo... j'aurais préféré la DCRI mais bon.

&gt;son mode de fonctionnement apporte une alternative au harcèlement vécu par les meufs sur les autres sites de rencontres ...et IRL

Mais quelles sont les causes de ce harcèlement ?

Il y a une réalité biologique : un mâle peut féconder plusieurs femelles en même temps, et pendant quasiment toute sa vie. L'inverse n'étant pas possible (grossesse, ménopause, règles). Du coup, compétition sexuelle et ""utilité"" différente : un homme dominé est moins utile qu'une femme dominée. 

[Il naît 105 hommes pour 100 femmes](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/detail.asp?ref_id=bilan-demo&amp;reg_id=0&amp;page=donnees-detaillees/bilan-demo/pop_age2b.htm). À 23/24 ans, on se retrouve à l'équilibre. À 55 ans (âge moyen d'un député en début de mandat), plus que 94,5 hommes pour 100 femmes. Si les statistiques de mortalité montrent quelque chose, c'est une écrasante **injustice envers les hommes**. Ou alors de la compétition plus féroce entre hommes.

C'est évidemment inapplicable entièrement à l'humanité, mais ça se traduit dans les chiffres : [10% des femmes n'ont pas eu d'enfants contre 14% des hommes](http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/ref/fporsoc06g.pdf) (femmes de 46 à 54 ans et hommes âgés de 48 à 56 ans), le phénomène étant aggravé quand tu comptes les individus morts vu que la mortalité est plus importante chez les hommes. 

Parmi les hommes, ceux qui sont dominés ont encore moins de chances d'avoir un enfant (17% pour les ouvriers). Parmi les femmes, ce sont les cadres et diplômées qui en ont moins, mais on peut croire que ce comportement est en partie désiré, alors qu'il semblerait être subi pour les hommes.

Tout comme la prostitution, le sexisme dans les jeux vidéo et les sites de rencontre est une conséquence des ces asymétries, pas une cause.

And a related issue is that the people of Europe seem to have little-to-no say in what the EU should be.  feel largely disenfranchised, and we've seen with the Lisbon Treaty that the bureaucrats and politicians of the EU will ignore the established rules until they get the results they want at the time.

&gt;Around the late 19th century there was also a limited number of Polish voluntary settlers, attracted by the economical development of the region.[5] Polish migrants and exiles, many of whom were forbidden to move away from the region even after finishing serving their sentence, formed a vibrant Polish minority there.[5] Hundreds of Poles took part in the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway.[5] Notable Polish scholars studied Siberia, among them Aleksander Czekanowski, Jan Czerski, Benedykt Dybowski, Wiktor Godlewski, Sergiusz Jastrzebski, Edward Piekarski, Bronisław Piłsudski, Wacław Sieroszewski, Mikołaj Witkowski and others.[5]
The term Sybiracy might also refer to former exiles, such as those who were allowed to return to Russian-held Poland following the amnesty of 1857[citation needed]. The group, popular among the youth in the period preceding the outbreak of the January Uprising, supported the idea of organic work. However, during the January Uprising it ceased to exist as some of its members supported the Reds, while others supported the Whites. Among the most notable members of the group were Agaton Giller, Henryk Krajewski, Karol Ruprecht and Szymon Tokarzewski.[6]
There were about 20,000 Poles living in Siberia around 1860s.[5] An unsuccessful uprising of Polish political exiles in Siberia broke out in 1866.[5]

&gt;At the start of World War II, the Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Polish citizens, most in four mass waves. The accepted figure was over 1.5 million.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13] The most conservative figures[14][15][16] use recently found NKVD documents showing 309,000[17][18][19] to 381,220.[19][20] The Soviets did not recognise ethnic minorities as Polish citizens,[18][21] some of the figures are based on those given an amnesty rather than deported[8][18] and not everyone was eligible for the amnesty[22] therefore the new figures are considered too low.[16][18][23][24] The Polish Institute of National Remembrance now estimates of the number of people deported to Siberia to be 320,000.[25] Tens to hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians were deported after the annexation of their states in 1939-1940 and German invasion of the Soviet Union;[26][27] many Tatars or Volga Germans joined them just a few years later.[28] Others were exiled not because of their ethnicity but for belonging to a social group, such as the kulaks, rich peasants targeted by the Soviet regime.[29]

true,meidei,CYPR,Demilitarised Cyprus 2015 Special: isyan! devrim! özgürlük!,"Not really.  Cypriot Greek doesn't really have noticeably more loanwords than other dialects of Greek, including the Standard. It has different loanwords, but about the same number (eg almost everywhere Standard Greek there's a French or German loanword, Cypriot Greek uses an English one). The changes that stand out are internal, changes that happen with time without clear outside influence. But in the Greek speaking world all non standard dialects ('dialects') are seen as inferior to standard dialects ('languages'). So many people see Cypriot Greek as a corruption of Standard Greek that cannot express but the most mundane thoughts (yet they express their dislike of Cypriot Greek... in fluent Cypriot Greek). The reform was going to teach Standard Greek of course. But it would acknowledge thay students at home do not speak Standard Greek, so it would teach the equivalency of grammatical structures between the two. Right now, books written in Greece are used, books that assume that students already speak Standard Greek natively. Obviously those books fail Cypriot students and leave them less competent in Standard Greek than their Greek competitors (since the academic and job market is common for the two countries). But the knee-jerk reaction was to treat a very popular teaching method as a Marxist ploy to destroy hellenism. 

As for the constitution, any change now, without the Turkish Cypriots rejoining the Republic first and provide their share of MPs and judges, will be considered disulution of the Republic of Cyprus, and any claim of sovereignty over northern Cyprus will be nullified. That's obviously a messy development. Large parts of the construction are not enforced because they require Turkish Cypriots to be part of the government, but since 1963, they withdrawn, initially as a protest, but then to declare independence.

(b) Keep him in, give him food and offer him your wife to ensure he doesn't do the same to your neighbors.

Any reasonable human being would choose a. You protect yourself and your kin first. You don't bring strangers in to commit crimes. But the delusional European neo-leftist who has delved so far left, he has no longer comprehension of basic survival instincts. 

&gt;He's committed a crime in Sweden. He hasn't committed a crime in Somalia. 

Who the fuck gives a shit, yes he committed his crime in Sweden and his punishment is deportation and removal of his rights to continue living Sweden to protect Swedish citizens from a monster. 

&gt;If he stays in Sweden, he can be locked up.

Hahahahahahahahaha. This is Sweden, he won't get a prison sentence longer than a few months. And why the fuck should Swedish taxpayers pay thousands if not millions in taxes to support a man who is not Swedish and has brought nothing but monstrous atrocities to their country. 

&gt;If he is sent back to Somalia he can rape again. 

Oh no, of course, we wouldn't want a safe haven like Somalia to turn into a violent place. Maybe Sweden can also take in al-Shabab and bring them to Sweden (they can be rehabilitated of course!) so Somalia can really be safe. 

&gt;to rehabilitate/isolate/punish (take your pick) him.

Oh yes rehabilitation of course. Just you wait skeptics in a few years he'll be writing his PhD thesis in quantum mechanics.  

So let's summarize your thoughts on this, Sweden no longer subscribes to the theory that immigration should be reserved for highly qualified individuals but rather for monstrous criminals and when they commit heinous disgusting crimes against citizens, they should not lose any privileges. Instead, they should be kept in Sweden to commit as many crimes as they would like to prevent the possibility that they commit these crimes in their own country and because there is an electron-microscopic chance that they may be rehabilitated into the successful immigrants you inevitably turned away in the first place to bring in these monsters in the first place. 

A round of applause for you. You have perfectly exemplified the spineless self hating neo-leftist attitude that has taken over Europe and threatens to crumble all of Europe. Pathetic. Sweden along with the rest of Europe is the laughingstock of the world and of history. Never have we heard of civilizations with such little regard for their heritage, culture and so keen to it crumble by importing criminals and supporting them. Our children will hate us for what we have done to Europe. And if you think I'm crazy maybe you should take a look at that video where that young woman is trying to walk through the streets of Brussels and gets sexually assaulted dozens of times.

And the [European Convention on Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights), which set up a pan-European human rights court of appeal that superseded national courts, was signed in 1950.

Qui semplicemente temo abbiamo due visioni, per usare un eufemismo, divergenti. E penso, senza offesa, che la tua sia un po' ingenua.
Obama è un democratico americano, ha promosso e proseguito guerre, è perfettamente inserito nella politica delle lobby tipica degli states, e sul welfare diciamo, sempre per usare un eufemismo, che non sono tutti soddisfatti. Basta anche solo fare un giro su reddit (dove sono tutti comunque classe sociale medio alta, e principalmente bianchi privilegiati) per rendersi conto che tutti sottolineano come esistano due Americhe, allo stato attuale.

I diritti civili (tipo i matrimoni gay), sono ovunque una posizione liberale, anche di destra. La condivido, ovviamente, ma solo da noi divide destra e sinistra. E per la cronaca, Renzi è timidissimo al riguardo, essendo cattolico.
L'obamacare non è di sinistra. è semplicemente buon senso, e in europa abbiamo un sistema sanitario infinitamente più avanzato, che sia destra o sinistra a tenerlo in piedi.

Renzi si può giudicare su due direttrici: le cose che ha fatto a Firenze e le cose che dice.
Senza pedantemente riprendere tutte le dichiarazioni e tutte le iniziative amministrative, basta pensare alle privatizzazioni spericolate che ha fatto, e pensare a come si è comportato con il mondo imprenditoriale, da Marchionne all'Ilva in giù.

E sì, per fare andare avanti il paese occore una riforma bottom up, non che andiamo avanti a rimettere a posto la piccola e media impresa mentre tutti quelli che sono più giù continuano a prendere bastonate ed escono fuori dalla rete protettiva del welfare.
Prima ti occupi dei poveri, degli operai e degli sfruttati. Nel frattempo vai con una mazza da baseball sull'evasione. Poi magari pensiamo di togliere le tassi a imprenditori e padroncini.

&gt; eh, allora immagino che a firenze abbia lo 0%. eddai. se avesse lavorato male avrebbe preso pochi voti, mi pare chiaro.

no, a firenze non ha lo 0%, rileggi meglio quello che ho scritto.

Se a te piace la retorica di Renzi ovviamente ne hai tutto il diritto. A me sembra una roba vecchissima, e, cosa peggiore, vuota.

-The parties in the current government made a big publicity stunt the day before the elections and convinced many people that the current opposition was about to cheat and manufacture votes.

-To form the current government both the support of the nationalist party and the minority party was needed. Absurd - nazis and minorities supporting the same government. Note that the socialist party (biggest one in the government) ran it's campaign by saying they will appoint professionls - not ideological party people.

-The Gov. made some shifting giving National Security more powers and gave the position to a party member from the minority party. The consensus is the appearance and past of that member triggered the protests.

-He is a media outlet owner and considered part of the ""new rich"" that used their connection after the switch to democracy to get easy loans they never had to pay back. He also looks and talks like a caricature of that class in parlament.

-The government retracted him from the seat, but it was too late people were in front of parliament asking who proposed a mafio for head of national security. To this day noone has came out and said who proposed Peevski.

-The slogan of the protest soon became ""step down"", but as the protest got weaker the prospect of the government stepping down seamed further. Yet the protest didn't die.

-There were of cource a lot of ridicules antics as thre protest dragged on. Antiprotest of people supporting the government, political parties were formed, all kinds of people came to protest seeing it as their chance to extort the government for funding in exchange for not joining the protest. My favorite part was when the oposition and the gov. payed a couple of thausand poor folk to make political rallies in Sofia and Plovdiv.

-Than came the students occupying the University of Sofia trying to revitalize the protest.

The whole process was ugly, mud was thrown every step of the way - at politicians, to be politicians, protesters and counter protesters. There wasn't much blood and the medias had a field day every day - exaggerating and inviting all sort of crazy people to their shows. I'd say the desire for change isn't going away, we're just waiting for a real party to show up.

The funny thing is from day one everybody protesters and politicians were cautious of that, having a party represent the protest. When in fact that is the only way to change anything.

The angle from all danish media was: ""*The EU attempts to kill danish pastry*"", when in fact it was a blatent case of danish authorities choosing to interpret the regulations much stricter than other EU countries were, as well as the pastry would still excist, it just wouldn't be legal to use the cheaper but carcinogenic supstitute, kissia cinnamon in it.

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"&gt; You have the EC; which is an unelected body that creates all EU legislation - that would be absolutely unacceptable in any EU nation, people would riot over it, yet it's the thing that governs so much of our daily lives these days.

The EC proposes legislation, it doesn't create it. Both council and parliament have to pass it and can amend it as they wish. Also, the EC is appointed by the council and confirmed by parliament. That's not so different from any head of government in Europe, i.e. appointed by the head of state and confirmed/""elected"" by parliament.

&gt; Then you have the fact that, at least in the UK and I'm sure most other places, all of the main parties are pro-EU and have arbitrarily deepened integration for decades with no particular popular mandate from the public. Nobody under the age of 57 has ever had a say on UK membership of the EU and even those who did were only voting on a trading pact; despite the ever-growing desire for a referendum, all parties have conspired to ensure we don't get one, breaking promises and ""cast-iron guarantees"" to kick it into the long grass.

Hum. Well, that's your national problem I guess. The treaties always made it clear that economic union is a vehicle for further integration, from 1953 on.

&gt; Then you have things like the situation in Ireland where they did get a referendum on treaty change and when the public returned a result the establishment didn't like, they just kept holding one until they got the answer they wanted! What the fuck?

That did not happen. The treaty was amended, i.e. guarantees were added that certain Irish issues weren't going to be touched (like abortion) and the commission was increased back to 27 (now 28) members instead of 20, so that Ireland could keep its commissioner and not share it with others. The claim that you vote and vote on the same thing till the answer is okay is simply untrue.

&gt; Perhaps most of that is for people who follow this stuff, I reckon for most people the biggest problem they have is that the EU is seen as a massive, wasteful, needlessly bureaucratic, incompetent interferer in domestic affairs. Instead of dealing with mass unemployment, inherent problems with the Euro or immigration during a global financial crisis, the only time you hear about them is when they're trying to give prisoners the vote, ban dipping oil, prevent terrorists from being deported or protecting their Strasbourg gravy train.

It's far from perfect, but considering that it works for more than half a billion people, it's really a fairly efficient and small organisation (less employees than a midsized-to-large city, less than 2% of total government spending). It also doesn't really have the authority to deal with inherent problems of the Euro (that's up to the members) or unemployment. Perhaps it needs better PR to set things straight. But then probably someone would complain that the EU is financing propaganda... lose-lose.

&gt; It's like they're totally incapable of looking at the big picture or understanding how self-defeating it is to interfere with sovereign affairs on petty issues, which just deepens the image of incompetence and the revilement of being denied a say on the white elephant in all our rooms.

The Single Market is *not* a trading pact. Far from it. Understanding the difference between a [Single Market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market) and a mere trading pact like a free trade agreement is crucial.  
With the Single Market, which is based on common legislation in all matters related to trade and guaranteeing fair competition by providing a common set of rules and regulation, comes a need to address the issue of putting this legislation on a democratically legitimate footing, which requires deeper political integration.

It's surprising how many people have this belief, and it certainly would be unacceptable if it were true, but the idea that the Commission ""creates all EU legislation"" is *not* true. 

All EU legislation is *initiated* by the Commission - usually at the request of the Parliament or Council - but once the Commission has proposed legislation, the power over that legislation passes to the Council and Parliament. They can veto it, or amend it until it bears no relation to the original, and their votes are required to pass it in whatever form they shape it.

So while it looks like initiative is a positive power - so that the Commission dictates legislation - it's actually the opposite. The only thing that the Commission can actually enforce is an *absence* of legislation, by deciding not to initiate it in the first place.

Except they are elected. **Just not directly by the people.**[put this in bold because some people don't seem to get that this doesn't mean that I approve of that.] They like the status quo though and I think they like to keep it in place as opposed to giving more powers to the EP. I think we have mostly our own national governments to blame for that.

&gt;Instead of dealing with mass unemployment, inherent problems with the Euro or immigration during a global financial crisis, the only time you hear about them is when they're trying to give prisoners the vote, ban dipping oil, prevent terrorists from being deported or protecting their Strasbourg gravy train.

Except that's not true. It's true in the national media which honestly only tend to make news out of bad news anyway. I hadn't heard about the Philippines for years untill thousands were dead and all was well with the US until suddenly our most private secrets were being spied on.  (some celebrities aside.)

If you actually look out for info put out by the EU itself you see there's a lot of other stuf like you mentioned also being addressed. There are discussions about and things done for the unemployment or euro but for the most part the national media doesn't give a fuck or it's hidden in a small section somewhere in a newspaper. Maybe our national media differ but I'd really like some more coverage too. Some media sources are even so biased that the commission has an own blog to addressing falsities in it.

The Strasbourg gravy train is seemingly something that many in the EU are trying to stop but something that mostly France is holding onto.

In Belgium someone interested in politics can watch the ""7de dag"" or something similar that specifically focuses on politics and the news addresses some stuff too. For the EU there is non of that focused coverage and people will have to just look most of it up themselves.

Of course when the EU suddenly proposes unified standards for selling vegetables and whatnot and says apples can't have too many spots, or when they tell a memberstate that stripping someone of their citizenship is unconstitutional it's suddenly important and it boggles my mind. 

That they couldn't kick out terrorists with a passport without making some constitutional changes is something those national politicians knew too but that they just said they couldn't do it because the EU wouldn't let them as if their mommy just tapped on their fingers. it made my blood boil.

Faux. Tout d'abord, ""copyright"" est un anglicisme qui n'a pas de place dans le droit français. En français on parle de ""droits d'auteur"". **D'auteur**, j'insiste. Article L. 111-1 du Code de la Propriété Intellectuelle, alinéas 1 à 3:

&gt; **L'auteur** d'une œuvre de l'esprit jouit sur cette œuvre, du seul fait de sa création, d'un droit de propriété incorporelle exclusif et opposable à tous. 

&gt; Ce droit comporte des attributs d'ordre intellectuel et moral ainsi que des attributs d'ordre patrimonial, qui sont déterminés par les livres Ier et III du présent code.

&gt; **L'existence ou la conclusion d'un contrat de louage d'ouvrage ou de service par l'auteur d'une œuvre de l'esprit n'emporte pas dérogation à la jouissance du droit reconnu par le premier alinéa**, sous réserve des exceptions prévues par le présent code. Sous les mêmes réserves, **il n'est pas non plus dérogé à la jouissance de ce même droit lorsque l'auteur de l’œuvre de l'esprit est un agent de l’État, d'une collectivité territoriale, d'un établissement public à caractère administratif, d'une autorité administrative indépendante dotée de la personnalité morale ou de la Banque de France**. 

Donc, en principe, le droit d'auteur revient...à l'auteur, même si sa partie ""patrimoniale* peut être cédée par contrat de travail (il est donc une bonne idée de relire son contrat de travail à ce sujet). Par contre, il-y-a quelques exceptions et dérogations. Ainsi, sur un type particulier d'""œuvre d'esprit"" l'employeur jouit automatiquement des droits patrimoniaux. Art. 113-9 CPI:

&gt;  Sauf dispositions statutaires ou stipulations contraires, les droits patrimoniaux **sur les logiciels et leur documentation** créés par un ou plusieurs employés dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions ou d'après les instructions de leur employeur sont dévolus **à l'employeur** qui est seul habilité à les exercer.

&gt; Toute contestation sur l'application du présent article est soumise au tribunal de grande instance du siège social de l'employeur.

Par ailleurs, les fonctionnaires et autres agents de l’État sont en fait **moins** bien traités par la loi que les employés du privé. Art. L. 131-3-1 CPI:

&gt;  Dans la mesure strictement nécessaire à l'accomplissement d'une mission de service public, le droit d'exploitation d'une œuvre créée par un agent de l’État dans l'exercice de ses fonctions ou d'après les instructions reçues est, dès la création, cédé de plein droit à l’État.

&gt; Pour l'exploitation commerciale de l’œuvre mentionnée au premier alinéa, l’État ne dispose envers l'agent auteur que d'un droit de préférence. Cette disposition n'est pas applicable dans le cas d'activités de recherche scientifique d'un établissement public à caractère scientifique et technologique ou d'un établissement public à caractère scientifique, culturel et professionnel, lorsque ces activités font l'objet d'un contrat avec une personne morale de droit privé.


&gt; Les dispositions du premier alinéa du présent article sont également applicables aux agents de l'Etat, des collectivités publiques et des établissements publics à caractère administratif.

Il faut surtout distinguer entre droits ""patrimoniaux"" (argent, pognon, oseille...) et les droits ""moraux"". Art. L. 121-1:

&gt; L'auteur jouit du droit au respect de son nom, de sa qualité et de son œuvre.

&gt; Ce droit est attaché à sa personne.

true,darps,,Schwob,"1. It is usually in good fun. Yes, we mock the Bavarians for their separatist tendencies, unfinished airport and silly habits, just as they mock us (Swabians) for being greedy, speaking in tongues and not being able to renovate a goddamn train station. Together we mock Colognes for hiding their faces behind devil masks so the kids won't run away upon sight, or Berlin for having tons of trouble with minorities although their percentage of foreigners is lower than ours. Furthermore, everyone mocks the Ossis (especially Sachsen) for mourning the downfall of the DDR and badmouthing the states that pay for rebuilding their infrastructure (""What a relief we can't understand a word of their complaints""). It's all part of the game, in the end there's little truth to many prejudices and nothing is to be taken personally. 

2. Some people take offense at the fact that foreigners always associate German with Bavarian. Germany has a rich culture and you'll find new traditional meals and drinks and habits in every second village, so it's quite a shame that just one state seems to count and the other 15 go largely unrecognised. It's also weird when people expect a Hamburg citizen to master the Schuhplattler, for example. It's simply a Bavarian thing that has nothing to do with us.

3. Lastly, it's the fact that Bavaria has due to its resources, healthy industry and *ahem* dominant culture a strong influence in Germany, and other Germans pity Franconians for having to put up with them. This, mixed with the emphasis on being a ""Freistaat"" (free state), making their own rules in some regards and having several political groups in support of separating Bavaria from Germany all leave a bitter taste of arrogance behind, even if the average Bavarian means well.

To wrap it up: I like Bavarians. Their food is great, the people are nice and Munich with its suburbs is great as well. It's just that they are sometimes too prevalent as a state, both nationally and internationally, which can be offputting sometimes. Beyond that, it's all fraternal rivalry and good fun.

Yeah let's fix it and have more unified banking policy and debt transfers. Let's do it tomorrow. Except wait they can't because you and many hundreds of politicians would start crying their ass off about how undemocratic that would be. Which it is.

&gt; In the absence of direct confirmation from the strangers, I believe ""Kunta"" was a reference to Kunta Kinte, the real-life slave and protagonist of Alex Haley's Roots, made into a miniseries in 1977. ""Fufu"" is the name of a staple starchy food eaten across the African continent. As welcomes to a new city go, it needed a bit of work.

I have a hard time believing that anyone who would pull shit like calling black people names and laughing at them would be well read (or have watched a 1977 miniseries) enough to know this, unless they are kids who have to read it in school or something. I could very much imagine that those guys were not even German themselves... either way, dick move!

&gt; Only a few days before, I had mentioned to my new housemate how Berliners seemed oddly at home with staring. They stared at me at the airport, at the train station, on the tube and on the bus, and as I selected bread rolls at the supermarket. 

I am subject to that on a daily basis, too, not being Asian in an Asian country. I have white friends who went to Uganda, Kenya, India, you name it. They got stared at. At the end of the day it is somewhat rude, but it doesn't get better if you get angry at it. No amount of feeling offended will make that better.
Where are the ""everyday microagressions""? The stares... and the one incident where some punk pulled her hair? I give her the hair thing, that was fucking rude and scary!! But what else? 

&gt; Afterwards, an audience member asked with a straight face if Michael felt ""more African or German"". His reply was prefaced by a deep sigh. I sighed as well.

Is it really sigh-worthy? Much of this man's fame comes from being of African descent, living in and surviving Nazi Germany. He's also very active in African and Race related activism. A question on whether he feels more African or more German is interesting. It is not even rude. It's, I assume, probably a question he gets a lot. I get that it must be annoying, but there's nothing wrong with that question in itself.
And he *does* seem to have an opinion and [answer](http://woyingi.wordpress.com/category/blacks-and-mixed-race-identity/mixes/black-and-german/) to it:

&gt; In 2009, Theodor received the first Black History Month Award for his role as an Ambassador for the Afro-German community. Theodor currently lives in Cologne with his second wife. “I walk a lot and rehearse, but that must soon make way because I wish to write my memoirs,” he says. **“It’ll be about a German, not an African.”**

Anyway, now that I have criticized that black lady in Berlin and got aggressive, I will agree with her. I mean, the article shows what people feel even if it's not really touching on the real issues. Yes, racism is an issue in Germany.  But it is usually not the kind of true racism that says ""Blacks are inferior... they should hold no position of power, they are X, Y, Z"". Conservative Germans are afraid of foreignness itself because it's the unknown. Many older ones don't concern themselves with other cultures at all, which is sad.  But it's not a microagression unless you make it one.

&gt; Our 'directness' can come across as unfriendliness. This can easily lead to misery.

A lot of Germans are unfriendly (to each other too) though. People who threaten to call the cops for no good reason are not direct, they are unfriendly.
That guy is unhappy because he's homesick, hasn't bothered to learn German, or make English-speaking friends at school. Granted, studying Computer science doesn't make it easier to socialize. Anyway, that's totally normal and part of the exchange experience when you go to a different country that you are not in love with or familiar with.

OK, so you're for giving the European Parliament more power. I'm a federalist, too, so we seem to agree on that.

&gt; As I said in my other post; the EEC referendum was a vote on a trading pact for the voters, ask any of them and they'll tell you. You can call them stupid for not understanding or lament the Government of the time misleading them but revisionist history is simply unhelpful.

I wouldn't call them ""stupid"", but apparently they didn't properly understand what they were voting on. It's all been there [from the start](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuman_Declaration).

&gt; Plus the EU is unrecognisable compared to what it was back then, so the need for a referendum still stands

If you have a Single Market, you need a way to decide the rules and regulations that define it. Since we seem to agree that such a process requires democratic legitimacy, a certain degree of political integration is an obvious consequence.

&gt; Before anything happens I believe people should have a choice, if I thought the EU was capable of reform I may even vote to stay in, but the active denial of democracy to a nation's people sticks in my craw and I simply cannot ignore it. I actually find it distressing that people like you can deny that right to a choice as long as the thing in question is something you support.

I don't deny you that right at all. By all means, have your referendum. If you decide to stay, this will be a strong mandate for the Ever Closer Union, and if you decide to leave, we can all finally move on on our respective paths.

Pourquoi ?

&gt;on redécouvre la France qui ne connaît pas la crise

Il faudrait préciser ce que tu entends par là. Les études (par exemple celle de Christophe Guilluy dans [son dernier bouquin](http://www.amazon.fr/Fractures-fran%C3%A7aises-Christophe-Guilluy/dp/2849412015), et [l'entretien qui va avec](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCVuLYspRXY) ) montrent que la France qui ne connaît pas la crise est la France des métropoles, toutes classes sociales et niveau scolaire confondus. La France qui connaît la crise est celle des zones périphériques.

Pour ce qui est de l'éducation, l'essentiel du tri social se fait bien avant le bac, puisque seulement [36% d'une classe d'age décroche un bac général](http://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/les-news/actu/detail/article/bac-2013-ce-que-cache-son-taux-de-reussite-record-2444/).

Parmi ces 36%, est-ce que le tri social est significatif dans les prépas et grandes écoles où est-ce qu'il est négligeable devant la sélection qui s'est faite avant ?

&gt;Comment des ""experts"", des ""élites"", des personnes cultivées ou brillantes peuvent-elles faire preuve d'un tel aveuglement et d'aussi peu de remise en cause ?

La remise en cause ne concerne pas les classes prépas, mais bien le primaire, le collège unique, et le lycée. L'aveuglement, c'est de pointer les grandes écoles alors que le problème vient d'ailleurs.

&gt;ce système de rente transmise dont on prétend qu'il récompense le mérite n'encourage pas l'excellence

Pourquoi ? C'est quoi l'excellence et quelles sont les données qui te permettent d'affirmer ça ?

&gt;comment peut-on désirer autre chose ou espérer construire son propre chemin alors qu'il est si facile de rejoindre nos grosses boîtes, de payer le prêt immo de sa maison à Rueil et de diriger ses gosses sur les mêmes vieux sentiers battus.

Parce que cette vie est super chiante et qu'on aspire à autre chose ?

I never said that. 

It would be a rhetorical question if he made a point with it about the EU.

Which he doesn't.

It's not a loaded question either.

""Why hasn't the EU done anything right so far"" is a loaded question because it implies the EU has never done a single thing right. Which is wrong or at the very least an opinion.

&gt;you should have found somewhere to copy from that referred to it as a loaded question.

What?  It uses your exact same example you used: ""have you stopped beating your wife?""

The only discussion this is about it is if the question is loaded question. 

Now what I actually said follows that definition and says that the presupposition must actually be something that can be false for it to be a loaded question. 

Hence ""Why does gravity pull us down"" is not a loaded question. Because nobody's gonna say that gravity doesn't pull us down. It is something commonly accepted as fact. Of course one can start arbitrary discussions about what ""down"" is and if gravity actually ""pulls"" but that's not the goddamn point.

Hence I'm assuming you don't think that the EU has an image problem or that you believe that there's a notable amount of people out there that think that the EU has no image problem. 

Am I assuming wrong with that?


One more. If I see the man beating his wife, continue my day and then the next day see that he is not beating his wife. Would asking him at what time did you stop the action of beating your wife be a loaded question? 

I think not because nobody is denying it and both the man, his wife and I take that he was beating his wife at one point as fact.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; Much of it is deserved, I actually think that the primary problem people have with the EU is how undemocratic it is, both on its actual internal structure and the lack of influence the people of its constituent countries have on it.

The primary reason why they don't is because all EU decisions have to be vetted by representatives of national governments.

&gt;You have the EC; which is an unelected body that creates all EU legislation - that would be absolutely unacceptable in any EU nation, people would riot over it, yet it's the thing that governs so much of our daily lives these days.

The Commission is approved by the Parliament after being vetted. I'm pleased to say that this interrogation by the EP is *not* a formality: candidate-commissioners can and have been rejected if they were found wanting. The only difference with a national government is that the candidates are proposed by the member states rather than the Parliament itself - a matter of states wanting to maintain some influence.

&gt;Then you have the fact that, at least in the UK and I'm sure most other places, all of the main parties are pro-EU and have arbitrarily deepened integration for decades with no particular popular mandate from the public. Nobody under the age of 57 has ever had a say on UK membership of the EU

Neither have they had a say of UK membership. Nor is it habitual for countries to hold such referendums, even where there is reasonable doubt on the desire of people to stay into their union, like the UK, Spain, Belgium, France, Italy, ...


&gt;Then you have things like the situation in Ireland where they did get a referendum on treaty change and when the public returned a result the establishment didn't like, they just kept holding one until they got the answer they wanted! What the fuck?

I don't see the problem. The treaty was changed, so it was different. If the people really didn't want it, they would have kept voting no. Apparently the changes were sufficient to make it acceptable.

&gt;Perhaps most of that is for people who follow this stuff, I reckon for most people the biggest problem they have is that the EU **is seen as** a massive, wasteful, needlessly bureaucratic, incompetent interferer in domestic affairs. Instead of dealing with mass unemployment, inherent problems with the Euro or immigration during a global financial crisis, the only time you hear about them is when they're trying to give prisoners the vote, ban dipping oil, prevent terrorists from being deported or protecting their Strasbourg gravy train.

Leur projet se trouve bénéficier à un très grand nombre de personnes. Grâce à ça ils ont pu en vendre et grâce à ça leur entreprise s'est fait côté.

I saw that input request by the EU for a copyright reform I think and it's basically a big, big pile of administrative mess. The idea is good but the execution of having people send secret emails to them directly that only get made public after the process has finished is just ridiculous. That undermines discussion from the start. Not to speak of the laws they linked to as a guideline of what the situation is and where to start, should we want to critique it. That legislation is so long and so vague that you have to read all 300 pages or more of it to have a vague idea of what's there.

I'm all for speaking my opinion but if it's required to either having to have studied law and invest a week of reading time and 2 weeks formulating a response until I can reach a point where I can reasonably represent the opinion I hold or to pay a lawyer to do it for me, I'll not do it. How can I do it? How can other people who are even less interested in these topics be motivated?

The whole design of the EU is made so that big organisations with resources and decicated people for certain topics can deal with it best. Like lobbys, unions, parties and coporations. For me as a singular citizen the EU has neither the plattforms nor the media to communicate anything meaningful or that could spark a useful
 discussion. It'll not happen in the comment sections of MPs youtube vlogs or on their twitter. The idea that that could happen is **insane**!

There are many sides to this: the fragmentation of their websites, the TV and radio things that I'm not sure what purpose they are supposed to serve, the tens of thousands of websites that surround it. 

Plus the amount of information that needs to be communicated is just too much. You basically need to be a full time citizen, as in participant in and follower of the processes, to have an idea of what's going on beside the really big topics. Who wants to do that? Apart from not having the time or the money to justify that, it's really nothing people *want* to do.

But it is usually not the kind of true racism that says ""Blacks are inferior... they should hold no position of power, they are X, Y, Z"".

Agreed. It's an underlying issue that's more prevalent in older generations, but since it *can* show up in everyday life, I thought I'd mention it.

In general, I figured that most comments would be along the lines of 'nah, you're fine!', so I thought I'd raise a counter-point.

Should he be mad at the EP because they are forced to go to Strassbourg every time because France likes it and they have no power to change that? No. Should he be mad at them because his media only gives a shit about the EU when there's a rumor that bananas will now have to be straight. Maybe, I think not. The EU already puts out info about what it's doing but the media doesn't really care about it unless it could be something weird. So people end up having to look for it. The only way I see to change that is if the EU would actually spend quite some money on it with an own tv/radio channel similar to national tv/radio but I don't think that's the best solution and I can already hear the cries about it being propaganda.


Who should he be mad at that there's a status quo that supports the commissions power and halts the EP from making real changes or democratization?

I'd be mad at those national governments who keep holding onto their power personally.

Of course you can dislike the EP too and think that it should be just the national governments without any overarching layers of bureaucracy but then don't use examples of the national governments blocking or not putting forward changes to show how incompetent the EU is. That's just silly.

&gt;THE **REINCIDENTES** CONCERT  IN QUITO HAS BEEN SUSPENDED DUE TO FERNANDO 
MADINA BEEN VANISHED IN MIAMI.
&gt;Quito, December 8th.

&gt;The vanishing of Fernando Madina, vocalist and bass guitarist of Reincidentes, in Miami 
International Airport remains unresolved. The band arrived in Miami on Friday, December 6th at 14.35 local time, as a layover prior to proceed their flight to Quito (Ecuador). There they were expected to perform in the XVIII edition of the World Festival of Youth and Students as headliners, in an open concert.
Whilst the rest of the band had to continue their journey to Quito, Fernando wasn't allowed to board the plane for security reasons that remain unknown.

&gt;After countless attempts to establish contact with him, even through airport's loudspeakers, and having passed more than 12 hours unaware of his situation, we contacted with the Inmigration Authorities in Florida's state, the TSA, the airline and other courts.
They acknowledged there wasn't any claim for him nor he wasn't under custody.

&gt;48 hours aftwerwards, his family has presented a lawsuit to the Spanish Police, being the Spanish Embassy in Washington already aware of it. It has declared that tomorrow Monday they will establish contact with the US Authorities in order to find Fernando.

&gt;The band would like to thank the people at the festival for their support and understanding, during this rough patch for all of us.

As I stated this new form of ""social contract"" isn't the pursuit of the cheapest option, it gives freedom and flexibility to all parties, if a group of cities wants's cheap energy they can gang up and use numbers to negotiate, but this system basically creates the opportunity for more service providers(jobs), this in term because of the open market gives more options(cheaper and more efficient) which in term generates more individualized solutions. There will be cities that will require a unique and costly solution, but in those cases I don't see why a massive, continentally guaranteed(not financed), investment can't be an option, a nuclear power plant in Finland or a massive bridge in Athens.

Cities have more flexibility and control over public works. Needs are universal but not identical and more importantly solutions need to be individualised.

There is also a sociological aspect, mayors tend to be elected on immediate to medium term projects, that are easy to evaluate by their constituency. Common interest is much clearer in a ""small"" community, and because of this politics takes a back seat to actual progress. And the other side of the coin is also a good argument people rally behind urgent agendas and demand change and because the city council is ""tangible"" even independent candidates can win citiy elections without breaking the bank.

And there will be the psychological argument, people are attached to their cities, real attachment not like nationalism, they grew up on those streets, they went to school with their opponents and hopefully want their children to grow up in a better city.

&gt; 1. Les inventions faites par le salarié dans l'exécution soit d'un contrat de travail comportant une mission inventive qui correspond à ses fonctions effectives, soit d'études et de recherches qui lui sont explicitement confiées, appartiennent à l'employeur. Les conditions dans lesquelles le salarié, auteur d'une telle invention, bénéficie d'une rémunération supplémentaire sont déterminées par les conventions collectives, les accords d'entreprise et les contrats individuels de travail.

&gt; Si l'employeur n'est pas soumis à une convention collective de branche, tout litige relatif à la rémunération supplémentaire est soumis à la commission de conciliation instituée par l'article L. 615-21 ou au tribunal de grande instance.

Dans la convention collective nationale de l'industrie pharmaceutique, cet aspect est régulé par l'[Art. 29](http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichIDCC.do?cidTexte=KALITEXT000005682476&amp;idSectionTA=KALISCTA000005753691&amp;idConvention=KALICONT000005635184&amp;dateTexte=29990101):

&gt; La rétribution du salarié tient compte de cette mission, de ces études ou de ces recherches et rémunère forfaitairement les résultats de son travail. Toutefois, si une invention dont il est l'auteur dans le cadre de cette tâche présente pour l'entreprise un intérêt exceptionnel, il se verra attribuer, après la délivrance du brevet, une rémunération supplémentaire pouvant prendre la forme d'une prime globale versée en une ou plusieurs fois.

Donc, si la molécule est vraiment révolutionnaire, le chercheur aura bien droit à un petit pactole. Et si le labo songeait à lui nier ça, le chercheur pourrait s'adresser à la [Commission Nationale des Inventions de Salariés](http://www.cncpi.fr/fckupload/File/2010_10_30_INPI_Commission%20Nationale%20Inventions%20Salaries_CNIS.pdf) pour exiger son droit.

Dans la pratique, les entreprises de ce type ont de toute manière tout intérêt à offrir des primes à l'invention pour motiver leurs employés.

ok, allora sì, è un'analisi fasulla. Inoltre un esame grafologico non si fa su lettere prese a cazzo, ma su una testo preso in una situazione controllata (se è possibile, ovviamente). Come tutti i test, si fa in situazioni di laboratorio... O i risultati sono falsati.

Questo invece è un discorso diverso. Il singolo ""sintomo"" non vuol dire nulla e ha senso solo considerato nel contesto in cui si presenta. Anche per le analisi del sangue un solo valore non può essere usato per una diagnosi ma va considerato assieme a tutti gli altri. E la stesura di un profilo di personalità è più complessa delle analisi del sangue, ti assicuro.

Faux. De nombreuses sociétés fonctionnent sans objectif matériel. Tu peux par exemple prendre comme modèle ce que propose [Pierre Rabhi](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Rabhi), c'est à dire consommer le minimum pour avoir un impact minimum sur ton environnement.

Ou alors, fixer comme objectif un temps de travail minimum, comme dans les [sociétés de chasseurs cueilleurs](http://www.detambel.com/f/index.php?sp=liv&amp;livre_id=9600), où le temps de travail est de 4 à 5 heures par jour, et suffit amplement à nourrir toute la population.

You will 99% not find real racism or harrasment. In my area there are more Asians than black people.

Germans are known for beeing more direct with their opinion so if you have a problem you actually need to tell someone or they will tend to ignore you. If you say you are going to be home by 10 actually be home or give a call.

Closed door to your room means you want to be alone. You usually close the door (and open the window) after you leave a bathroom. 

Air conditioning is basically exclusive to shops if at all.

Personal space is relativley important. People are not really touchy. Handshake is common. If you know a girl well a hug is fine, too. 

Try to go to a town-club after school since the school doesn't really offer much once the school is out. Sadly finding friends as an exchange student is a bit harder in Germany than in other countries. By no means impossible though.


Asian people have the hardest time with German and English usually. Sadly a lot of them end up speaking only english since most people can speak it either way and German is really hard. If you actually want to learn German spend all of your time with locals and not with other exchange students.

LIMIT the time spend talking to your family/friends to ~1 a week after you are ther for a bit because it will only make you homesick and keep you from making friends here.

Don't expect to pass the year in school unless your German is incredible good.

true,gamberro,IREL,Éire,"&gt; I never got the our exports hurting Greece nonsense.

Well firstly as it is a big exporting power sharing a currency with diverse economies, when Germany exports outside the Eurozone it benefits from a significantly undervalued currency. This is an added advantage to Germany's already strong manufacturing industry and its ability to curb real wages. But now that the peripheral countries are focusing on exports, the euro is likely to appreciate and thereby [squeeze the less competitive countries all over again.](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b3faf9b0-2489-11e3-8905-00144feab7de.html#axzz2mzvSEPiN)

Secondly, even with the figures in the article, which only account for one month, Germany's current account surplus is still over the 6 percent threshold set by the European Commission (it will probably be [around 7 percent this year in line with the figure last year.](http://mises.org/daily/6592/)) So, Germany is technically in breach of the already high Commission threshold for surpluses (the threshold for deficits is 4 percent). If Germany still had the Deutschmark or another currency, it would appreciate in the face of such strong exports. Given that Germany is the largest economy in the Eurozone those figures should be worrying.

My argument would be that Germany is entitled to export as much as it likes provided that it imports enough to fall within the thresholds established by the Commission. As Barroso recently said:

The UK has always maintained a streak of independence vis-a-vis the Continent.

English culture is much more aligned with the US than with Europe (must be the Anglosaxon heritage...). In addition, the phsyical presence of the Channel and the typical Islander mentality has erected barriers (both physical as well as cultural and social) between the Uk and the Continent. 

Geography, geopolitics, history and culture therefore combine to create quite a large gap between Europe and the UK.

The EU is merely the most radical and most contemporary manifestation of 'Europe,' and therefore attracts the most anti-Europe vitriol.

The fact of the matter is that every single official who has any significant say in the European Union is either *directly elected* or is *appointed by someone who is directly elected*.

The European Council and the Council of Ministers are composed of national government officials, and they are also directly elected (or appointed by people who are directly elected)

The 28 Commissioners, who form the College of the Commission, are all high-level national politicians, and the vast majority have, at one point in their lives, been directly elected. Ashton is one of the very few who has never run for elected office in her life (for which she was harshly criticized), but she was appointed by heads of European governments. If you don't like her, blame your national politicians for appointing her. There were other, equally (or rather, even better) qualified candidates who had been democratically elected they could have chosen, but they selected her.

Certain low and middle-ranking Commission officials entered directly into public service via extremely vigorous, transparent and fair competitions. They are the only ones who do not represent or work for an EU country, and have not been elected. But they are merely civil servants and administrators, whose job it is to carry out the orders decided upon by higher, democratically elected or appointed officials.

Frankly, I do not see any democratic deficit.

Yes, LED lights cost more up front.

That makes them MUCH cheaper to run over the life of the bulb, even if they cost 10x more than the incandescent bulbs we've all been used to.

First off, you are conflating the Commission with the European Parliament. They are entirely different institutions. The Commission's ultimate goal is **absolutely not** to turn the EU into a federation. The Commission serves at the pleasure of the member States, and is the first to say that a certain policy is not within its competences.

Second, the European People's Party is merely one party amongst nearly a dozen in the European Parliament. They of course have a platform, just like any national party. The EPP does not have an outright majority, so cannot railroad anything through; it must work eith other parties, which may not may not agree with the EPP's federalizing goal. In addition, the European Parliament has very limited to no powers in transforming the EU into a federation. 

Any significant change at that level must be taken by the Council, which is the heads of European governments. So that is extremely unlikely. Furthermore, it would require **Treaty revision**, which is an extremely lengthy and difficult process, and requires the consent of all 28 Member States.

To conclude, the only way the EU will ever become a federation is if every single one of its 28 member states wants it to become one.

Car seul l'intérêt corporatiste ne réussit pas à faire même un petit consensus ailleurs qu'au sein de la corporation. 

&gt;la France qui ne connaît pas la crise est la France des métropoles, toutes classes sociales et niveau scolaire confondus

Comparons ce qui est comparable peut-être ? Je pense que tu as parfaitement compris ce que je disais mais que tu voulais ramener Guilluy qui dit certaines choses et en omet d'autres. Il y a énormément de choses à dire sur ce sujet et je crains que ce ne soit pas l'endroit ni le moment. 

&gt;Pour ce qui est de l'éducation, l'essentiel du tri social se fait bien avant le bac, puisque seulement 36% d'une classe d'age décroche un bac général. 

Je sais bien. Mais je ne vois pas le rapport. C'est comme dire que parce que le système public américain souffre d'un manque de moyens financiers, on ne peut pas critiquer l'inflation des prix des diplômes qui atteignent des montants exorbitants aux plus hauts niveaux. 

&gt;La remise en cause ne concerne pas les classes prépas, mais bien le primaire, le collège unique, et le lycée. L'aveuglement, c'est de pointer les grandes écoles alors que le problème vient d'ailleurs.

Je ne vois pas où je pointe les grandes écoles pour les échecs de l'ensemble du système. Je parle juste des prépas sur le sujet des prépas et j'analyse leur relation avec ceux qu'elles prétendent former, nos élites. Et il est certain que même si on réglait les problème amont dans le primaire et le secondaire, le système de prépa resterait un système inadapté aux enjeux actuels. 

&gt;Pourquoi ? C'est quoi l'excellence et quelles sont les données qui te permettent d'affirmer ça ?

C'est plutôt à toi de prouver en quoi l'excellence est encouragée par le système de prépa. C'est pas en mettant une carotte devant des ânes qu'on les transforme en pur-sangs. 

&gt;Parce que cette vie est super chiante et qu'on aspire à autre chose ?

Un bon élève fait ce qu'on lui a appris. 

&gt;17% des diplômés de grandes écoles sont partis à l'étranger[4] , et 2% sont chefs d'entreprise (c'est un peu moins que les anglosaxons, mais c'est un phénomène qui n'est pas spécifique aux grandes écoles).

Les 83% restés au pays sauront bien leur faire payer. L'expatriation est loin d'être un avantage dans notre cher pays. 

&gt;Qu'est-ce que tu proposes ?

Une fonte des prépas au sein des universités. Ce qui se traduirait par une sélection voire un concours pour les écoles supérieures de niveau master ( ingénieur, médecin, avocat, manager ) autres que des carrières scientifiques mais qui seraient ouverts à tout étudiant ayant pris les bons électifs. Une réunion des écoles beaucoup trop nombreuses actuellement ( ça c'est en train de se faire, mais c'est le même problème que le nombre de communes en France ). Une diminution des effectifs CNRS au profit des établissements qui n'ont pas la spécialité recherche pure afin de créer des labo de recherche en ingénierie ou autre là où c'est pertinent.   

Je pense que ça contribuerait à faciliter les parcours et la transition vers le monde du travail ou de la recherche. Aujourd'hui, ce qui règne même en grande école ce sont les parcours mal foutus. A base de triple diplômes, de reconversion à peine le diplôme obtenu et de jobs d'entrée où tout le monde se retrouve à la fois surqualifié et peu impliqué.

We are asking for public input for what the Commission's strategy should be to manage Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) for the extremely advanced technologies inside the satellites.

I agree with you, what I'm puttig together now is quite difficult to understand unless you have a law degree, a specialised degree in intellectual property rights, and have read the 15 documents and Directives and such. But what are we supposed to do? It's a really technical issue, and it's directed at experts.

From an insider's point of view, let me tell you how the publi consultation mechanism works. Businesses and firms get together and create associations, which conglomerate their interests and are represented at EU level here in Brussels. You don't need to have a lot of money; every member can pay a membership fee to the association (something like 100 - 500 euros a year,) and have their interests represented. These associations are usually a small team of about 3 - 10 people, and all they do every day is follow EU policy, track policies and documents, attend meetings, talk to policy makers, etc... So basically you are delegating the representation of your interests to them.

The Commission launches **lots** of public consultations. I mean, I'm just a Trainee and I've been involved with 4 already, and I've only been working here since September. I go through a big book (kinda like the Yellowpages) which lists all associations, and invite all of the relevant ones to our meetings. They decide if they want to send  a representative or not. If they do, they have a chance to provide feedback and input, and influence Commission policy.

So yes, it is quite difficult, and it's not necessarily for the layman. It's usually more targeted at specific audiences with expertise. But the mechanism is there, and it is as democratic as we can get it at this stage.

Anyway, I hope that answers some of your questions",0,1386611554,null,0,false,0,cdxivcy,t3_1sgdtv,t1_cdxivcy,t1_cdxf2w3,null,1428325558,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

This is pretty much a planned economy, the problem being that we can't currently run planned economies. We can't even define what an economy is or is supposed to do. 

I am a firm believer in Friedrich Lists and his arguments for the protection of infant industries. And if we can't create protectionist barriers, we should subsidize the growth of infant industries, thus not dealing with the planned economy problem.

&gt;If Germany still had the Deutschmark or another currency, it would appreciate in the face of such strong exports.

And then they would print money to depreciate it. This argument keeps getting thrown around and it ignores all of pre-Eurozone history or monetary policy.

true,bradthe,null,null,"Could be a little late to this but I'll have my input. I think EU has such a large image population because the general population of a member state doesn't understand why the Union was set up and what it's purposes and aims are for today. 

In the early 50's when it is was clear that the main aim of the European Coal and Steel Community was to limit the output of Steel and Coal for building of munition and the aim was peace and prosperity for the members of the treaty. Evidence of this can be seen in the preamble of the EEC treaty being;

 *'to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the people of Europe to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common action to eliminate the boundaries which divided Europe to secure the consent improvement of the living and working conditions of their people and to strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing difference existing between various regions and by means of a common commercial policy, to secure the progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade’'*

The aim of peace by the Union has been largely successful, from a political point and members of the Union have never gone to war. Only geographically speaking the only war to happen in Europe was the Kosovo War in '92 and the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2009, all parties to conflict were not members of the Community. 

An off shot of the ECSC was that economic property flourished because of the establishment of free movement of goods and impositions tax between the community states.  

I feel like the peace aspect of the Union is taken for granted now and this aspect of the EU is never fully taken into account when people question the purpose of the EU, people are more willingly to consider the imposition of the detriments the EU has on them in their member states especially in Britain with regards to the principle of free movement of persons. (When in fact it can also be a benefit for them). 

I feel if the EU wanted to establish a more positive image it should inform the Union Citizen's that they actually are Union Citizens and the rights they can derive from being a Union Citizen. The only direct evidence people have in everyday life is that one line they find on the front of their passport, but nobody's interested in the front line, just looking at goofy picture of themselves. People often question the reason and existence of the EU but never question the existence of a particular nation. Union Citizen title-ship I feel would bring Union Citizens closer together and share a common bond that they can identify with, regardless of nation state.

It doesn't even have to be that the ""new"" product is more expensive. Hell, to continue on my original example, it is entirely possible that a German company would purchase a small time Romanian company dealing in a specific product, and, after reorganising the way the product is produced and shipping it around to its own warehouses for better logistics, ends up creating a cheaper AND better product.

The thing is though, that by doing this, some of the profits that would've otherwise not left the local Romanian market, now end up in Germany (again not saying this is always the case but it is a rather common occurrence), which means there's less local profits for the local government to tax and more money to tax in Germany etc..

true,meidei,CYPR,Demilitarised Cyprus 2015 Special: isyan! devrim! özgürlük!,"Cremation is illegal, but you can get your relative's body cremated abroad (usually in Bulgaria). Obviously that is extremely expensive because of the special air flight and all. (The reason it's still illegal is because the Church rents the burial plots. Very lucrative business and they have a monopoly. The earth is packed so a number of remains are exhumed every 7 years or so and others take their place. So cremation is actually necessary, but unless the Church gets a monopoly on cremation services, they are not going to let it happen)

IVF is not illegal per se. There's actually no law at all. There isn't any regulatory framework to guarantee that everything is done properly. So it's very risky for doctors to provide that service with the sole guide of their conscience, and patients don't have any protection if something goes wrong. For about a decade there's a bill stuck in some parliamentary committee to regulate this, but it's stalled by bishops with arguments like ""what if the father dies before the eggs are fertilised in vitro? Then the child will be born an orphan, and that will harm their psychology. We can't allow that"". 

Abortion is also illegal ""unless the life of the mother is in immediate danger and that's certified by two doctors"". In practice, if you got a little money, you can bribe your way to a legal, safe abortion. Sadly, very poor women try to self-abort (at least once a year you hear about a fetus discovered in a trash bin somewhere), or flee the hospital right after they give birth, leaving the newborn behind.  

Another sad part of the HIV care in Cyprus is that the support groups aren't inter-sectional. The Drug Addicts support group turns down HIV+ people, openly LGB people, and transgender people. The HIV+ Support Group turns down drug users and transgender people. The LG(B) support group turns down drug users and transgender people as well. There's actually a HIV+ trans-woman drug addict currently detained in Cyprus Central Prisons, without access to medical care. She was arrested for a minor robbery and resisted arrest. Initially, they even charged her with ""aggravated bodily harm with intend"" because by resisting arrest (she spitted on the police officer), the police officers felt that they risked contracting HIV+. As far as I know, that charge was dropped. But she's in solitary confinement now because they wouldn't let her in the woman ward because she is ""a man from the waist down"", nor in the men's ward because the other prisoners would likely rape her within an hour. Because there's no yard for transgender prisoners, she can't go outside. The two yards are segregated for men and women, and according to the Police, she's ""half man, half woman"" so she can't go outside to neither. 

HIV+ cisgender prisoners (vast majority of them drug addicts) are also kept separate from non-HIV- prisoners, but they are usually more than one. Being a transgender on top of that means that this woman will have to remain in solitary containment for a year or so just for a minor robbery. And no mainstream support group stepped up to advocate for her rights. The LGB group doesn't want to be associated with ""junkies"", as they said, and the others don't want to be associated with an LGBT person. The only support she gets is from a person I know, who does try to educate the prison guards entirely volunteer, because their conscience dictates so.

Here are some examples off the top of my head which you can search further if you're interested:

- Germany being a huge factor in corruption of poorer countries, through endless bribing and corrupt practices by its multinationals, which are involved in almost each and every scandal that exists in Greece (since that's the examples I know of), including: Siemens, Ferrostaal, MAN, Hotchief, others in road building I can't remember of, etc. 

- Germany gaining money from the crisis itself, through ridiculously low spreads and rates for internal borrowing. Last I read (in a German newspaper), I think the gains were up to 80 billion.

- Germany having a currency that is unrealistically low for such a manufacturing and exporting powerhouse, gaining in the trillions throughout Euro's existence, while imposing fiscal policies on poorer countries that essentially crush them. 

- If you want to also take on ethical or 'justice' issues, how about the fact that Germany is one of the biggest 'defaulters' of debt in recent history, refusing to pay debts at least a couple of times, and now insists that debts to banks and hedge funds must be paid at the expense or real people and lives in other countries.

Il punto di Batman è proprio che si muove oltre la legge, e ha la polizia contro. E il suo fascino e la sua tragedia sta nel fatto che se ne rende conto, e vive il conflitto tra la consapevolezza di operare del male in nome di un bene superiore, convincendosi di essere l'unico intitolato a farlo (i cattivi di batman sono versioni distorte di lui stesso: anche loro indossano un costume e si muovono contro la legge per portare la loro idea di bene superiore).

Prendi anche il film, sia Batman che Ras al Ghoul si muovono per il bene di Gotham, l'ambiguità del personaggio sta proprio nel fatto che lui decide che le sue modalità siano migliori di quelle di Ras.

Anonymous debates aren't a contest about who gets the most visibility. The gain for everybody comes from reading sophisticated exchanges of opinion and learning from them. Downvoting stuff you simply disagree with robs yourself and everybody else of that chance.

They have 2 intakes per year, in October and in March. Click here for the application procedure:
http://ec.europa.eu/stages/how/steps_en.htm

The application registration date for the October 2015 intake opens in January. It's quite competitive, but not impossible. To get selected you need to go through a few stages. First, you make a profile and fill out the details online. If you pass this stage, they ask you to send in supporting documents. Send in literally everything you've got: academic transcript, grades, any certificates for training you've ever done, language courses, etc etc... Then they rank all the applicants, and the top 2 800 applicants are 'shortlisted' and put on a Blue Book. This means that you are on a database, and Commission officials who want a Trainee can go through it and select some. Contrary to what people say, you **need to lobby aggressively!!!** This means that as soon as you are put on the Bluebook, you need to go online, find the Commission organigramme, and start sending out your CV to whoever you can. I sent out something like 30 to 40 emails before getting selected. If you are on the BlueBook, this **does not mean you will be selected**. 2 800 people make it to the Bluebook stage, but of those, only about 700 get chosen. So only about 25%.

Every institution has their own Traineeship program: the European Parliament, the European Council, the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank, etc... In addition, there are also traineeship programs for the other Executive Agencies as well as the Committee of the Regions and the Committee for Economic and Social Affairs, which are slightly less competitive.

true,emergency_poncho,EURO,European Union,"good question, only Sweden can answer that. Ultimately, no one forces anyone to join the EU - every country needs to ask itself if the benefits of joining the EU outweigh the negatives. If a country does decide to join, then it has made that cost-benefit analysis, and come to the conclusion that the benefits do indeed outweigh the costs. So it might be possible that although Sweden loses out on the agricultural aspect, it benefits in many other areas. For example Sweden champions environmental issues, and it is one of the leading players in the world on environmental standards. If it was speaking alone, Sweden would have only been able to achieve a tiny fraction of what it has been able to do through the EU. So in this case, the EU can serve to amplify Sweden's voice on the world stage, and greatly increase its influence.

Also, I'm not an expert on Sweden, but I know that it does have some exceptions to the CAP rule, and benefits because there are some places in Sweden where agriculture just makes no sense (too cold) and yet it receives funds to help farmers remain viable in those areas. In addition, Sweden is fighting to have a greater proportion of CAP funds be dedicated to improving sustainable farming techniques, help developing countries, increase environmentalism, etc... as opposed to merely using the money to subsidize small farmers. Sweden is slowly having an effect, and influencing how the money is spent.

So in essence, there are 2 choices. You can either just quit the EU (like the UK wants to do), in which case you no longer have a say in EU policies, but because the EU is such an enormous bloc right on your doorstep, you will still be affected by its policies, but you will just have no say in shaping them (basically what happens to Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland).

Slowly? We have been in the EU since 1995 and the EU is willfully trying *not* to improve. Why did one sponsor wine and tobacco for starters? At all?

I want out, because all I see is that I am setting up my future grandchildren to transfer huge amounts of money to Greece's future grandchildren. I mean, for example Greece Spain and Portugal has been in the EU since 1981 and 1986 - when are they going to contribute? For how many decades more am I going to pay for them, for policies that obviously isn't working, for things that are bad? Obviously they vote for it - they want my money and don't want change, and they outnumber us. Had they wanted change, they would have voted for it. No, the EU is not changing, it is getting worse, and the best thing one can do is to get out. I mean, I see what they have done with the CAP - we are being discriminated and fucked over. Now they want to lay their grubby hands on energy and other things too. I can see how I have to sponsor coal in Poland while our prices rise. No, no, no - I want out. 

&gt; Sweden is slowly having an effect, and influencing how the money is spent.

No we are not. And, if one *knows* what is right, why not do it? The EU just don't want to do what is right, they don't give a shit. If they did - why are we still being discriminated? 

And, why should it take decades if things are obviously wrong? There is not natural law that says so? EU could change immediately , if they choose to. They just don't want to.

On a related note, my father is somewhat notable in France's modern literature. Anyway, he assisted to the Prix Goncourt, which is the most notorious literary prize in France. He told me how the winner this year won by a single vote, and thus everyone flocked to buy his prize-winning book. Meanwhile, the guy who got second place stayed there all day at his stand, and practically no one came to see him to buy his book, which had minimal publicity.

I made the same argument emergency_poncho made, that maybe Sweden was willing to give up some ground on the CAP in exchange for benefit elsewhere, and if Sweden didn't do any such thing then maybe they should've sent better EU negotiators. Apparently this makes me racist.

Amazing.

That were the ""erststimmen"", you need to look at the ""zweitstimmen"", they got 7,4% there.

&gt;With a better mobilisation in the rest of germany it would be possible to fall below the 5.0% mark.

Simple math:

* Votes for CSU: x=3.243.569 	
* total votes: y=43.726.856

* percentage of votes for CSU on national level x/y = 7,418%

* to fall below 5% (I calculated with 4,999) you **need 64.884.357 total votes** if we assume that the number of voters for CSU does not change.

* total population of 80,5 million, according to [destatis](https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/GesellschaftStaat/Bevoelkerung/Bevoelkerungsstand/Tabellen/AltersgruppenFamilienstand.html) there are ~13,5 million below the age of 18 (i assumed an even distribution in the group of age 15-25, sorry for that simplification, but i couldn't find other data) so that leaves us with ~67 million people in germany who are allowed to vote, but you have to subtract the foreigners that are not allowed to vote (6,8 million, but i got no information about the age distribution of these) also. So there are **less than 67 million people who are allowed to vote**.

Apparently this makes me racist. 

No, you defend Sweden being *discriminated* against, in an argument from several months ago. That is why I call you a racist. You defend discrimination, which is disgusting. Every form of discrimination is bad, and should cease immediately. That is not the same thing as ""win some/loose some"", which is normal. Discrimination is outside of that. So, what makes you a fucking racist is that you defend discrimination.  

&gt;Again, I never said this. I said that maybe Sweden loses in the CAP, but gains in other areas. 

Yes you have. You have defended the CAP, its size, how it is done etc since, well , forever. It is not beneficial to Sweden. As for gain in other areas - well, Norway and Switserland are surviving fairly well, and they don't have to sponsor the idiotic CAP.


&gt; Regardless, there is no singular point in the CAP, the CAP has a number of different purposes. 

Not unemployment benefits, which is what you are trying to make it in to. Anyway, if it is going to be used for that, we should vote about it, not get it squeezed in to the back door. 

&gt;it's not good governance to defund tobacco growers in a country (Greece) that's already undergoing a massive economic crisis.

Greece's, and the Euro countries problem, not connected to CAP. Let them fix it, why should I be forced to sponsor tobacco because they are incompetent and are trying to take more money from me. They should never had received *anything* for tobacco, and it is bad government to keep something like that on the books for decades. *That* is truly bad government. The fact that you don't even reflect over how bad it is keeping something like that on the books for decades tells me a lot of how truly  subsidising/discriminating/masturbating you are. 


&gt;Interesting, it's amusing that you also chose to address that I've already corrected you regarding wine subsidies multiple times.

I don't think wine, wine growing in any form or anything should be subsidised, but I know you do. I have a hard time coming up with stuff you don't want to subsidise, with Swedish money of course. 

And, I don't find you amusing, and I have repeatedly told you to stop addressing me, but apparently you can't stop. I don't like fucking racists, and you are one. Stop adressing me, I never address you. I will not ask you not to be a stupid racist shit, because people like you can't change, all I want is for you to stop writing to me. Apparently you can't even stop that.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"&gt;No, you defend Sweden being discriminated against, in an argument from several months ago. That is why I call you a racist. You defend discrimination, which is disgusting. Every form of discrimination is bad, and should cease immediately. That is not the same thing as ""win some/loose some"", which is normal. Discrimination is outside of that. So, what makes you a fucking racist is that you defend discrimination.

Nowhere have I *ever* done any such thing. Quote the post for me.

&gt;Yes you have. You have defended the CAP, its size, how it is done etc since, well , forever.

I have defended the policy as a CAP that should exist on a European level. I never said it was beneficial for all countries in a financial sense (I make the distinction because food security plays into it), but I have never said specifically that it is a better agricultural policy for Sweden than if Sweden had it's own. Norway and Switzerland subsidize their agricultural production about *three times as much* as the CAP does. [Norway 63%, Switzerland 56%, EU 19%.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/content/table/20755104-table1). This is the Producer Support Estimate (PSE) which determines how much of an agricultural producers income comes from subsidies. So no shit those two are surviving fairly well, they subsidize their production a fuckload more than the EU does.

&gt;Not unemployment benefits, which is what you are trying to make it in to. Anyway, if it is going to be used for that, we should vote about it, not get it squeezed in to the back door.

I said there was no point in this reform period cutting it for Greece thanks to the crisis they have. And they *did* vote about it, in the European Parliament, when they approved CAP funding and reform for 2014-2020.

&gt;I don't think wine, wine growing in any form or anything should be subsidised, but I know you do. I have a hard time coming up with stuff you don't want to subsidise, with Swedish money of course.

I explained to you that two third of the money going into wine subdies goes into the 'grubbing up scheme' (by far the largest portion of that two thirds), which changes the agricultural production away from wine grapes and towards more economically viable agricultural produce, and structural reform of the wine industry so that those other producers that can be profitable do so. You chose to ignore this every time.

&gt;And, I don't find you amusing, and I have repeatedly told you to stop addressing me, but apparently you can't stop. 

You asked me to find what money was being spent on in the CAP about 6 months ago. I was curious myself to find out the specifics (I already knew about the grubbing up scheme, but not the details), so I spent some hours researching the thing to understand it and got back to you. You're shitting on the time I spent every time you bring up tobacco and wine subsidies again when I've explained all this stuff to you. That's why I address you when you bring them up, because I spent hours researching about it so I could explain to you in detail what it goes towards.

true,emergency_poncho,EURO,European Union,"I'm sorry, but you need to calm down and start thinking rationally. The EU is the world's leading environmental player. The EU got the Kyoto Protocol to happen. The EU has the world's most advanced green energy technologies. The EU is the most advanced when it comes to cutting carbon emissions. the EU invests more in sustainable energy than any other country in the world. Sweden is a big factor in pushing the EU in this direction. 

The EU is not interested in doing what's right? First of all, when you say 'The EU' you mean 'the 28 countries which comprise the EU' right? Because the countries are the ones who decide EU policy. 

And in international relations, there is no 'right' there is only the preferences of countries and what they choose to fight for. One country is willing to sacrifice economic growth for more inclusive social policies, or a larger welfare state, or cutting emissions. Thus they pursue those policies. Another country prioritizes growth above all else, and they pursue that. There is no right or wrong in international relations, there are only countries pursuing policies.

Regarding tobacco, you're going to have to start citing sources for this tobacco argument. CAP funds go towards a lot of things. It's possible that some of the money destined for small farmers goes towards farmers growing tobacco, but there is absolutely no preference for tobacco over other crops. In fact Brussels has a pretty strong anti-smoking policy

Since the EU is not a federation, there is 0 transfer of funds going on. Every country pays into the 'pot' which forms the EU budget. Every country's contribution of the EU budget is proportionate to their GDP, and every country has equal say where that money goes. Every country also has a veto right they can use at any moment. There is no transfer of money from one country to another. You have not transferred a cent to other countries. Whatever money has flowed from Sweden to another country was agreed to by your national government or representatives. If you don't like it, blame your national government, no one else.

Also, all the money that was lent to Greece and other European countries was a loan. None of it was given away for free. Ireland has already paid back all the money it was given. Portugal is on the way. Spain will be next. Greece has worse prospects, but you can bet your ass that Germany will do everything in its power to get the money it (and Sweden) lent to Greece. The only way you will not see the money lent to Greece is if Greece defaults.

Do you understand the ramifications of leaving the EU? You're absolutely free to do so at any time, but you do realize that EU policies will continue to affect you. The only difference is that you will not be able to influence those policies.

The EU cannot change immediately. It requires 28 countries which are quite different one from the other to agree on something to change it. Trust me, I work in the EU, I understand how it works. There are many, many different actors, and all act like squabbling children. And let me tell you, the member states are the most childish of all.

There's also lots of other really cool technology onboard that relate to signal frequencies, encryption, the technology that goes into the signal receivers, etc...

So we're trying to figure out how we want to treat all these new technologies. Since Galileo is a public project (owned by the EU, and paid for by EU taxpayers) that means that the EU owns the majority of these technologies (some will stay with the companies or labs that developed them, but most are owned by the EU).

So the question is: what is the Commission strategy to manage the rights to these technologies? Does the Commission make them public? That would spur more innovation if people can have free access to these technologies, but at the same time other countries like the US and China and Russia also will have access to them. Do we try to monetize them? Do we sell them to the highest bidder? Do we take steps to ensure they stay within the EU? How can we do this? Do we keep them to government owned research institutions, like the military?  And so on and so forth...

If they are - why have they sponsored tobacco for decades? Just one example of how they willfully are doing bad stuff? I mean, if we know what is right, why is the EU refusing to do that. 

&gt;Whatever money has flowed from Sweden to another country was agreed to by your national government or representatives. If you don't like it, blame your national government, no one else.

No, my country have fought since we joined to reform the CAP for example. However, the rest of the EU don't give a shit. It is *not* my governments fault that we are sponsoring tobacco, and I have no idea how you can claim that. How on earth can you blame the government Reinfeldt for the Greeks growing tobacco, and getting paid for it? He is against it, however, no one care. The EU wants a big CAP, because it suits the south. We reformed our agriculture in the 70's, but since the south of the EU don't want to reform, we have to pay for them. How is that fair? They outnumber us, they obviously vote for keeping the money flowing so that they don't have to do what we did  - reform. How can you defend the CAP? 

&gt;Also, all the money that was lent to Greece and other European countries was a loan. None of it was given away for free. Ireland has already paid back all the money it was given. Portugal is on the way. Spain will be next. Greece has worse prospects, but you can bet your ass that Germany will do everything in its power to get the money it (and Sweden) lent to Greece. The only way you will not see the money lent to Greece is if Greece defaults.

Not the money I am talking about. I am talking about the fact that Greece have been a recipient of EU money since the entered the EU, 32 years ago. Apparently that is money down the drain. For how long they going to be reciepients? Empires have been founded, won and lost in less time than Greece can start becoming a contributor. We are just adding countries, but not contributors. Why aren't they contributors. My granddaughter, who doesn't exist, will pay for Greece, I am sure of it. Why not say that 25 years are max or so? How is the politics in the south such a colossal failure and for how long should I pay for that? 

&gt;Do you understand the ramifications of leaving the EU? You're absolutely free to do so at any time, but you do realize tha


The EU is trying to take over more and more. I have seen what they have done with the CAP - it is inefficient, environmental unfriendly and hurtful and discriminating to Swedes. I am not sticking around to see what they will fuck up next. 

And, more integration means more of our tax money flowing south, to countries who are far more corrupt and of course will vote for us paying for them, without them chaning of course. Just like the CAP. 

I mean, it is obvious - if the EU investments worked, Spain, Portugal and Greece should be net contributors by now, shouldn't they? If the funds and all the money we poured in there worked - why are they not contributing? 

&gt;So if you're unhappy, direct your anger at your national government, because they are the ones screwing over Sweden, and no one else.

No, they are aginst the CAP, among other things. That is 44 % of the budget btw. They are not screwing us over, the EU is. Please inform me how 9 million Swedes alone can change the CAP? Also inform me, for how many decades we will have to be discriminated and hurt by it? How can that be good for us? And, why should we take it when the EU *could* fix it, they just refuse to?  

&gt;here is no transfer of money from one country to another. You have not transferred a cent to other countries. Whatever money has flowed from Sweden to another country was agreed to by your national government or representatives. If you don't like it, blame your national government, no one else.

Are you kidding? Who pays for Greece if not the north? Does those CAP money comes from thin air? Or the regional funds? 

&gt;I'm sorry, but you're going to have to start citing sources for this tobacco argument. CAP funds go towards a lot of things. It's possible that some of the money destined for small farmers goes towards farmers growing tobacco, but there is absolutely no preference for tobacco over other crops. 

We shouldn't sponsor tobacco and wine at all. Period. How is that beneficial to Sweden btw? 

[Here is one link, how ""unfair"" it was when the EU cut those subsidies, but didn't remove them](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/23/eu-agriculture-tobacco-idUSL5N0HJ30320130923). Do yo want more? 

&gt;The EU cannot change immediately. It requires 28 countries which are quite different one from the other to agree on something to change it. 

Bull.some of the changes, that are right, are very easy to make. For example, give me a good argument that we have sponsored tobacco for deceades? Don't have one- well, we could have removed that one from the books ages ago  -*if* the EU wanted to do the right thing.

Julia Seeliger hat IMHO den besten Beitrag zum Thema verfasst: http://seeliger.cc/2013/assange/ 

Ich möchte dem Autor nicht zu Nahe treten aber er und viele andere die ähnliche Blogposts veröffentlichen haben einfach keine Ahnung von der Technik und Philosophie hinter der vermeintlichen Hacker-Kultur. 

Die Frage auf der jede Argumentation aus dieser Ecke aufbaut ist ob er ein Vergewaltiger ist. In diesem Post und auch in anderen wird die Antwort klar mitgegeben: Ja! 

Basierend auf dieser Prämisse baut man sich dann eine Argumentation auf, nach dem Motto, dass es ja völlig daneben ist so jemanden Sprechen zu lassen...

&gt; Die Bühne, die man Assange gegeben hat, leidet enorm unter der Belanglosigkeit der lecture. 

Was für ein Bullshit-Statement. Jakob Applebaum (kennt der Autor warscheinlich auch nicht) und Assange thematisieren einfach ein sehr naheliegendes Thema. Es ist für den Autor belanglos weil er nicht versteht worum es in dem Vortrag vermutlich geht. 

Frank Rieger ist auch angepisst: 
&gt; Lese mmer wieder erstaunt, was ""der CCC"" gefälligst alles tun oder lassen muss, welche Strategie ""er"" angeblich verfolgt etc. Echt absurd…

&gt; Die öffentliche Reaktion des CCC-Spitzenpersonal ist Abschottung. Anstatt sich dem Diskurs zu stellen

Das ist größtenteils Bullshit @andreasdotorg Diskutiert mit einer elendigen Geduld und erklärt die Zusammenhänge. Ich hab aus Interesse genug Twitter-Konversationen verfolgt um für mich zu sagen, dass man die Vorwürfe in dieser Härte einfach nicht halten kann. Das ist letzlich ab einen gewissen Punkt und einer gewissen Ignoranz unsubstanzierte Trollerei. 

&gt; Mit Kurz, Rieger und – als Shooting Star – Fefe 

Shooting Star? Noch ein Indiz für die Unwissenheit und Ignoranz des Autors. 

&gt; Und warum sollten wir Kurz und Rieger als Held_innen bezeichen? 

Äh - macht das jemand? Ich postuliere etwas sinnfreies und argumentiere dann toll dagegen... 

&gt; Die Antwort ist einfach: der 30C3 ist keine emanzipatorische Veranstaltung, genauso wie die geselllschaftskritische Komponente eine staatstragende, reformistische ist. 

Puh. Was für ein Argument: Die Hacker-Konferenz die diese Leute seit Jahren veranstalten entspricht nicht meiner Vorstellung der Welt. Macht das doch bitte so wie ich das will... Wie kann man das denn ernst nehmen? 

&gt; Die erste Säule ist: das Bundesverfassungsgericht. Unter dem höchsten juristischen Korrektiv geht nichts mehr. Um abseits vom Parlamentarismus einen tiefgreifenden gesellschaftlichen Einfluss zu haben, sucht man den Schulterschluss mit der Judikative, und gibt sich bereitwillig als Sachverständige her. 

Wow. Was für eine Ignoranz und Idiotie in diesem Satz. Da wirft der Autor dem CCC tatsächlich vor seine Rolle ernst zu nehmen und zu versuchen durch _Sachkenntniss_ Einfluss auf politische und juristische Entscheidungen zu nehmen? Das liest sich so als ob das etwas schlechtes wäre. In was für einer Welt lebt der Autor denn? 

Ein letztes Zitat: 

&gt; Das ist die Debatte, der sich eine Hacker_innen- und Netzbewegung mit emanzipatorischem Anspruch stellen muss. Wollen wir, dass wir nur technokratische Stichwortgeber_innen im gesellschaftlichen Diskurs sind, oder sollten wir nicht lieber daran arbeiten, dass wir eine kohärente und nachhaltige gesellschaftliche Alternative unter Ausnutzung technischer Errungenschaften (und unter Kritik derselben) erschaffen? Die Politik des CCC formuliert in den allerseltensten Fällen die Kritik am bürgerlichen Staat an sich, vielmehr ist der reformistiche Charakter einer, der nachhaltig die Herrschaftsformen der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft stützt. Schon die Analysekategorie scheint überhaupt nicht präsent zu sein. Für mein Verständnis wäre es nachhaltiger, sich tatsächlich kreierend betätigen, anstatt reformistisch die bürgerliche Gesellschaft für ein angenehmeres Klima zu bearbeiten.

Apple was the first non-Russian company to change its chips, and they are now both GPS and GLONASS-enabled. So your smartphone can pick up signals from US satellites as well as Russian satellites! After Apple did this, pretty much every single smartphone producer or producer of software for smartphones (Samsung, Nokia, Motorola, Blackberry, etc...) also made their chipsets GLONASS-enabled.

China is doing something similar, in the transportation sector. Every car or long-distance bus needs to have the Chinese satellite system enabled, or else the government won't issue a permit for that vehicle.

Yep, aber zwischen welchen. Nicht zwischen Persönlichkeiten, die nach außen hin mitreißen konnten, sondern irgendwelchen wichtigtuerischen Waynes.

&gt;Tatsächlich hat die Weisband gezeigt wie unnütz diese Persönlichkeitendebatte wirklich ist. Sie ist gegangen wegen irgendwelchen Faschisten innerhalb der Partei. Nicht wie du schriebst, weil man ihr nicht genug gezahlt hat.

Oh doch. Hatte iwann mal was von ihr gelesen, dass sie einfach keine Perspektive darin sieht, unbezahlt Politik zu machen und dann noch zu arbeiten, weil sie nicht beides unter einen Hut bringen kann. Kann ich verstehen. Sie hat sich afaik auf jeden Fall auch dafür eingesetzt, dass Amter bezahlt werden.

&gt; Eine repräsentative Demokratie Deutschlands bedeutet eben nicht, dass sich das Volk nun plötzlich mit einem Idealisten abgeben muss welcher irgendwelche idiotischen Ideen hat und diese dann durchgesetzt bekommt einfach nur weil er ""geil"" ist. Es kann eben keiner von denen einfach irgendwas entscheiden. Die Entscheidungen werden von der Partei getragen und die Partei kann spätestens bei den nächsten Wahlen dafür abgestraft werden.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ich rede auch nicht von direkter Demokratie sondern davon dem Parlament, dem Gremium welches näher am Volk ist, den Grossteil der Macht zu geben. Da hast du noch immer keine direkte Demokratie aber es ist einfach reprästentativer. 

Ein Idealist kann trotzdem vernünftige Entscheidungen treffem, sehe das Problem nicht.

&gt;Du meinst also das Parlament hat gar nicht zu viel Macht?

&gt;Das würde natürlich die ganze Diskussion überflüssig machen. Ich ging bisher davon aus, dass du der 2. Hauptaussage zustimmst. Tust du das nicht, habe ich eigentlich nur meine Zeit verschwendet. 

Übertreib doch nicht gleich. Gegenseitige Machtbegrenzung der Instanzen (zu denen eben auch das Volk gehört, die gesamte repräsentative Demokratie ist doch eine Machtbegrenzung des Volkes in gesunden Maßen) ist doch völlig normal.

&gt;Jo. Ist ja auch fast gar nichts....

&gt;Das ist es doch. Es ist doch auch für einen Lobbyfutzi einfacher (und billiger) eine Persönlichkeit zu schmieren als eine Partei.

Würd ich jetzt nicht so einfach behaupten. Abgesehen davon ist ein ""normaler"" Lobbyismus gar nicht so schlimm, schlimm wirds erst wenn man eine Gewisse Grenze (-&gt;Korruption) überschreitet. Das lässt sich durch zusätzliche Kompetenzen des EU-Parlaments locker ausgleichen.

Imho is das der einzige Fehler im System, eine Machtverschiebung würde diesen exzessiven Lobbyismus von einem Moment auf den anderen eindämmen. (zb bestimmte erforderliche Mehrheiten des Parlaments und Gesetzesinitiative für das Parlament)

&gt;Was ist den der europäische Gedanke? Eine demokratieentschlackte Junta von geschmierten Persönlichkeiten?

Also bitte.

&gt;Es gibt halt weder einen Bundespräsidenten der EU noch ist davon auch nur irgendwo die Rede. Tatsächlich haben wir aber einen Präsidenten der Europäischen Kommission dessen Position nicht annähernd so nutzlos ist. Das ist auch die Person von der Schmidt u.a. gesprochen haben kann. 

Davon redet keiner, Schmidt will einen ""erstklassigen"" Mann, der der EU etwas plakatives über die Ländergrenzen hinweg gibt. Derjenige muss doch nicht mal zusätzliche Funktion oder Amt haben, das ist dann einfach jmd der wegen besonderen Qualitäten hervorsticht.

Da wiederrum ist dann dem Betrachter vorbehalten, was für ihn Qualität ist (-&gt;subjektiv).

Vergleich das doch so: Jeder Politik-interessierte hat doch bitteschön Lieblingspolitiker. Ja wieso denn eigentlich, ist das jetzt ein Führer? Nein, es ist ein ganz normaler Mensch, mit einer Persönlichkeit, die den Betrachter quasi beeindruckt und v.a. mitreißt, wegen welchen Qualitäten auch immer. Also weg von langweiligen Politikbetrieb, anstatt nur Inhaltskampf auch eine ersönliche Note.

&gt;Steinbrück? Der Clown vom letzten Herbst? Was ist mit dem?

I would like to believe that we can still strive towards that goal, as I love Europe and would hate to see it divided and irrelevant in the world. I don't think this crisis will last forever, but it would certainly help to have a good, intelligent Statesman who can lead the EU towards success. In fact, I think the future of Europe is THE hot topic of nowadays, and it is with that in mind that we should fight austerity, and by fight I mean find viable solutions. National movements against austerity, at least in Portugal and Greece, are a complete partisan-game bullshit, where populist parties try to gain relevance over shitty rhetoric.

I think European countries lack political conviction and strong personalities more than anything. The EU is facing one big challenge, and Southern Europe (at least Portugal) is arguing over pitiful subjects. I mean, yeah the government is doing some shitty austerity policy, but the opposition instead of fighting with a set of different proposals, just stands there with some utterly horrible, completely out of context projects. The other big party here in Portugal is letting the government gain unpopularity all by himself, letting the other opposition drown itself in their own worlds. In the end, they will capitalize this waiting period of relative silence by winning the elections with little effort and, even worse, no viable goals. On and the syndical movement? A disaster, completely partisan, never representing the workers. 

It's very sad and wrong to blame the Euro when our past was just a very large blob of failures, when every party is unable to leave their mediocre level because they are too scared to push realistic plans and argue about them and when our population suffers from some very serious case of not-caring at all.

&gt;Despite support from some EU governments and members of the European Parliament, **tobacco was excluded from the list of products eligible for production-linked payments.**

Interesting. So I guess you were wrong, tobacco is **not** supported after all.

&gt;""In my opinion, for the health of the discussions that we will have now, it is important to be clear that we stick to the issues that have yet to be concluded,"" EU farm commissioner Dacian Ciolos said.

In other words, tobacco is off the table. No negotiations.

&gt;The bloc is also currently debating new legal proposals for tougher controls on the sale of tobacco products. 

So, according to *your own source*, 9 member states (notice it is NOT the EU doing this, **it is the member states**) wanted to re-open negotiations to include tobacco support in the CAP. Their motion was rejected. I'm currently looking at the most recent version of the reforms, and I can guarantee you that there is no support for tobacco.

You keep coming to the tobacco issue, but there is no tobacco support. Like I said, there is CAP money going to small farmers, and some of these farmers grow tobacco, but that's it. So no, it is not *""still there""* as you say.

Again, you're not really responding to my points, you're just repeating yourself. 

From wikipedia:

&gt;Criticism [of CAP] has been wide-ranging, and even the **European Commission has long been persuaded of the numerous defects of the policy.** 

Unfortunately, as I have said, it is not a Commission or EU decision to decide what to do, but a member state government to decide. Currently, France benefits enormously from the CAP, and it blocks any attempt at reform. So don't blame the EU, blame France.

So, all my tobacco arguments still stands. 

&gt;Unfortunately, as I have said, it is not a Commission or EU decision to decide what to do, but a member state government to decide. Currently, France benefits enormously from the CAP, and it blocks any attempt at reform. So don't blame the EU, blame France.

No, that is idiotic. You are avoiding the fact that you  that extremely populous states like Italy, Spain (and Portugal and Greece to a far lesser extent) are voting with them. It is not just France,not by a longshot. 

And, as I said, the EU is made up by its member countries. Apparently, a majority of the people in those countries are *not* interested in reform, not interested in moving forward,not interested in spending money on something better, or a better CAP - **then they would have voted for it, but they don't**. Can you imagine what those people will do when they put their hands on more of our money? It is clear, they just want money from the north, without becoming contributors, without reforms and changes. Who the hell wants to be in a union where with people whose only interest is squeezing money from you without chaning? Because that is what they are doing. Greece have been in the EU for **32** years, how come they still are even allowed to receive money. 

And, tell me again how 9 millions Swedes alone can change the CAP? 
&gt;Again, you're not really responding to my points, you're just repeating yourself. 

Neither are you.

-Adopting of EU agricultural standards and regulations is very costy

-Opening market to EU means that protectionist Russia will have to close up its market to Ukraine to avoid free flow of goods through Ukraine. Right now there are virtual no restrictions of trade between Russia and Ukraine and Russia is Ukraine's biggest trade partner

Deflation means that prices are falling, and when that occurs, people put off making purchases (because if they wait, they will have to pay less), that means demand falls, and prices fall, and people put off making payments... This is the deflationary cycle, and is often considered to be one of the major mechanisms behind the Great Depression. Usually governments would solve this by deliberately inflating their currency through monetary policy, by lowering interest rates, or by quantitative easing (printing money). That wasn't possible during the Great Depression, because most economies were on the Gold Standard, with fixed inter-currency exchange rates. Arguably, the single currency is playing a vaguely similar role, because monetary policy must be decided to satisfy all Eurozone economies, and other Eurozone economies simply aren't facing the same problems.

At least, that's my understanding.

Edit: It's an interesting clash between German and Anglo ideas on this topic, because on both sides the basic thrust of economic policy seems to focus heavily on that period. But British and American views focused on deflation, whereas German views focused on hyperinflation.

To top that off, we *know* we will be downvoted in important stuff and that the EU is not interested in doing what is right, but the south who is more numerous just want to squeeze money from the north. I mean, if they were interested in doing what is right, why vote against CAP changes? If the EU works, why are Spain, Portugal and Greece still on the reciving end after 27-32 years?

DG ENTR deals with business and enterprise, so they like people that have business degrees, or political science, or economics. But then again, sometimes people get selected for a DG and it's difficult to determine why. A friend of mine works in DG HOME, which works on immigration policy and stuff. She has a great academic profile and experience, but she has never done anything even remotely related to immigration policy. So there's an element of luck as well.

In general, it's a good traineeship program for someone with a generic, social sciences background. Very few companies look for grads with political science, international relations, etc... kind of backgrounds. But in the Commission, they love people like that!

No real argument actually. This is just an expression of dissatisfaction towards the current economy and politics. What these people keep saying is, in a nutshell: (1) every politician is bad, so they must all step down, especially the current government; (2) they lead Italy in the current economic crisis, so they must bring us out of it; (3) banks and tax collecting agencies are evil; (4) we want less taxation and more money.

The protest has been ""organized"" by a group of mostly Central-Southern farmers (hence the name ""movimento dei forconi"", i.e. the ""pitchfork movement""), but it attracted a lot of workers from other areas. Some people allege that the mafia has infiltrated the protests. Fascist groups have also explicitly taken part in the protests.

&gt; 2) What do I need to know about Italian protests? This will be my first, though I've photographed others before.

The police are less organized in Italy than in other countries, so it's far easier for fascist and anarchist groups to get into the protests and make them 100 times more violent. Violence can become indiscriminated, and people who are engaging in illegal acts may react even worse if they see you photographing them.

Public transportation may get worse than usual. People will try to block roads and freeways. Prepare accordingly.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Can you point me to some more reading? What did you have before? How are you discriminated against?

Sigh, only in Swedish unfortunately, but we were far less subsidised and far more adjusted to the world market. *And* we didn't have to subsidise other countries tobacco and wine, nor did we have to pay them just because they refused to go through changes that we did in the 70's. I am for example thinking about the little farmer, we actually let a lot of them disappear, but now we have to sit and pay for a Greek guy. And for discrimination - long story, but to make it really short we get less money per cow than the French. That is discrimination, we do not have cheaper costs, Sweden is expensive. 

And, of course the south is not at all interested in changing.

&gt;(And why do you sound so angry? 44% of the EU budget only make less than 0.4% of total government spending in the EU. That really isn't worth being so angry. Sorry if I'm misinterpreting your tone…)

44 % of the EU's total budget is a lot. We are paying for being treated like shit, forced to be more non environmental and sponsoring wine and tobacco. I find that upsetting. 

And, it is also *how* they are doing it. If this is how the EU runs things, (and it is) then I want the EU to have less power, and be in charge of less things. 

For example, southern country and France are constantly voting against CAP change and reforms, and have for ages. Even though those reforms are necessary, and good. They are not interested in changing, the CAP debate clearly shows that, just interested in squeezing every cent that they can from the north. Otherwise, they would have initiated changes, not fought them. They would have changed, and thought it wise. 

I do not want to be in a union where we are outnumbered by people who think and vote like that. How can anything be build when people are like that? I am not surprised they are corrupt those countries, the people do not want change apparently. Had they wanted it, they would not have fought CAP change, that is easy to see. 

I mean, the EU is talking about taking over the energy policy. Something we are good at, and have low costs, comparatively. Of course that will not matter to the EU, our costs will rise while we sponsor fucking coal in Poland or something similar. 

I mean, if the EU want to reform, they would have done it. They are not interested. I do not want to be outnumbered and pay for people who behave like they do. ",0,1386631698,null,0,false,0,cdxs495,t3_1sgdtv,t1_cdxs495,t1_cdxrr37,null,1428308147,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;There is a limit over the pressure that you can put at the same time. A reform of the PAC is being negotiatied, but it's for 2015 at least. And it isn't probably what do you want.

Well, it might feel like it is coming all at the same time, just because Spain, and other countries resist sensible policies the whole time, just like the CAP or cutting down the fishing fleet. I mean, Spain have been hearing about that since the 90's at least. I guess you just don't want change. I do not want to be in a union with people who do not want to change, constantly vote against it, against sensible reforms, and outnumber us by far. The only thing they want is our money, not change.

The coal miners won a strike to the dictatorship in 1962 with riots way worse than those. [Link](http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/spanish-coal-miners-challenge-franco-dictatorship-1962). The coal miners also started a [rebellion/strike against the republic in 1934](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturian_miners%27_strike_of_1934) that ended with 2000 dead.

They have been extremely feared. They have access to explosives and they don't doubt about using them in their strikes.

The non-profitable mines were being closed slowly the last 30 years with reconversion plans and sending to retirement people. However the reconversion plans are bullshit the companies that opened in the mining areas closed the next day after the subsidies ended and moved to other places. 

Actually every form of energy is subsidized except hydroelectric power. And domestic solar energy that is losing all the subsidies and getting taxes. It's kinda funny they said that the privatization and liberalization would improve the situation, but before we had a simple and not very efficient system but it was cheaper and required less public money. 


&gt; Why? What is wrong with ship building? Is that also a subsidiesed industry?

Yes. And it's concentrated in Cadiz(that already has a 40% unemployment) and Galicia(kinda OK only 25%).  [It's from this July](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23344489). The EU responsable of competence(Joaquin Almunia) that decided the punishment is Spaniard. We are talking about paying back near 3 billions in subsidies, there is no way that they are going to be able to pay back. The government is trying to keep them alive until the EU parliament elections but I don't think that they are going to survive to this. Maybe some of them will be bought by some investors, but I doubt It. 


&gt; cutting down the fishing fleet. I mean, Spain have been hearing about that since the 90's at least.

Spain cut the fishing fleet. If makes you feel better the biggest company in the sector is  in bankruptcy because the managment ~~robbed the company~~ [committed some irregularities](http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/2013/4/15/pescanova_spanish_fishing_colossus_files_for.htm)

The reconversion has been done slowly because the lack of alternatives in the area. You can guess where are based the fishermen that are affected the pending reconversion, Cadiz and Galicia like the shipbuilding.
 
I think that you are missing the political factor. The fleet size has went down the last 18 years [from 18,478 ships to 10,116](http://www.farodevigo.es/mar/2013/11/12/flota-pesquera-espanola-redujo-mitad/912744.html). Recently have been anounced protest against the *reconversion,* and asking for rollback it and increasing the size of the fleet again to create jobs. I don't think that sending the people to unemployment more quickly would have been politically viable. ; And the current PM is from Galicia that's one of the strongholds of the conservatives.

The situation is getting weird. If you thouch the CAP what do you have to offer to the people that is living of the CAP.

Good then. We let our shipping industry die out in the 70's, why should we then sponsor yours? I am so bloody tired of sponsoring things in southern Europe that we ourselves have dealt with ages ago, or taken the rational deciscion to let it die out. Why can't southern Europe do that? Why is the EU forcing me to pay for your industry while we let outs die out ages ago, since it was too costly. Why can't southern Europe make rational deciscions like that themselves?

So, not my problem. The EU is not responsible for your unemployment, nor are the oceans. You are outfishing them, killing them, destrying the livelihood for Africans, fishing illegaly and generally just ruining everything. Why the hell should I sponsor that when we cut our own.

Bull. The situation is like that because *again*, just like with the CAP, Spain has refused to reform. You have been told since the 90's to cut down your fleet, and there was plenty of alternatives then. You just refused too, just like with the CAP.

And, then you keep voting for squeezing more money from Northern Europ, and when we finally say something, you then complain that it is so sudden/impossible/unemployment etc. Well, if you hadn't voted and worked agains the reforms, it wouldn't be like that. You fucking caused this, and a lot of other things, but we are suppose to pay for it.

Why would I want to be in a union with people like that? Don't you dare tell me you want change - why have you then voted *against* CAP reforms? 


&gt;We don't have the interests and concerns. And you are missing the political context. The current situation is already very difficult. Do you think that would be possible to put more pressure in the sector in Spain?

You are not concerned about the environment, working industry, cutting down on subsidies etc? I guess not, you only want money from us

And, frankly, don't give me that talk about the current situation in Spain. You have resisted and voted against all forms of reforms since forever. You could have ended a lot of the subsidies when Spain was going well, but it is to nice to get money from north, so why change? I mean, you have always voted against CAP reform, against fishing reform, against anything really, so don't you dare tell me it is because of the current situation. 

In fact, Spain has been on the receiving end of EU money since 1986. 27 years! Empires have been built and lost in shorter time than that. When will it stop? Are my grandchildren going to pay for people in Spain? 

I don't want to be in the EU because it is apparent to me that the south do not want change, and they vastly outnumber us. It is evident with the CAP- had the south wanted change they would have reformed, and voted for it. They haven't, ever.

true,JasonYamel,UKRA,Ukraine,"In 2004, Ukrainians came out to a similar protest and chanted the name of a leader - in effect they thought that placing all their hopes (and responsibility) on one person's shoulders will work. Here, we turned the tide for you and secured your victory against fraud, now our part is done, we're going home. Such an approach would likely fail even this politician (Yuschenko) was a more worthy leader and not a weak-willed mediocre man. The inevitable disillusionment came within one year and demoralized people who thought they sacrificed so much to bring him in.

This time around, people did not come out on the streets for a leader, they came out for their own dignity and future. I think this time it's clear to the vast majority of them that their task does not end if/when they succeed and force president Yanukovych to make major concessions or leave. They're in it for the long haul, both in terms of protests and what will go on afterwards. Even if the protest utterly fails from this point on and fizzles out, Ukraine is a much changed country now.

And when Ukraine makes progress towards Europe (either under current regime or the next one), it is Europe's choice whether to bog down such progress in its typical bureaucratic morass and have another Turkey at their borders, and thus give Russian strategists ample opportunity to pull Ukraine back into its neo-imperialist project, or to become a relevant force in the world, a force that stands for everything you mentioned, for modern western values without American hypocrisy and imperialism.",0,1386643560,null,0,1386643832,0,cdxxn7i,t3_1shm3g,t1_cdxxn7i,t1_cdxrkt3,null,1428305516,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

Les circonstances qui ont amené aux évènement de Mai sont clairement mentionnées dans """"Rêve général"". Notez bien que Mai 68, ça ne se limite pas à l'occupation de la Sorbonne : ce sont les grèves, les occupations d'usine spontanées qui surprennent jusqu'aux syndicats. C'est la société française dans son entier qui est en émoi.

Vous l'avez dit vous-même ce documentaire ne fait que relater les faits : il est très peu partial et donne voix tant aux garants de l'ordre établi qu'aux anciens leaders étudiants. Ce que ces étudiants essayaient de faire ? Réagir violemment contre une société socialement rigide, très catholique et paternaliste et où la sexualité est encore largement réprimée. Tout ça alors que les rapports de force démographiques ont changé et l'accès aux mass média devient un accélérateur de changement considérable en ouvrant la France au monde. Je n'invente rien, c'est dans le documentaire.

Les conséquences en revanche sont peu abordées car elles se produiront *à la suite* des évènements de mai, tout au cours des années 70 : essor d'un féminisme militant, droit à l'avortement, généralisation de la contraception, pédagogie scolaire, autogestion, écologie...

I've read a bit about Ukraine's situation in last couple weeks and from what i understand is your currency is devaluing, there are talks about limiting the amount of $$$ u can convert from local currency (caz of lack of reserves), in 2014 Ukraine has ~10 billion USD in maturing debt and u can't afford that, so the  talks with IMF is being held (which is always a bad sign). You add to that an overall external debt of ~130 billion and rising, decline in GDP, rise in bonds risks (some say ~50% chance of default as of now) and its not a pretty picture.


How in such economic conditions Ukraine can reform its industries in according to EU association agreement to just *keep* their economy alive (not even talking about a rise of exports or production), i have no fucking idea. 


In the end i'm afraid of one thing only: Ukraine joins EU association agreement -&gt; it economy gets fucked beyond recognition -&gt; Ukraine takes a shit ton of loans from Chinese, IMF, World banks and the like, which cannot be repaid -&gt; shit happens, situation gets worse and new ""leader"" rises, who seek help from East -&gt; now its a fucking Russian problem.


So far the story remains the same:

&gt; &gt; La création de richesse est une chose positive.

&gt; Preuve ?

""Pour la science économique actuelle, la richesse économique correspond à l'ensemble des biens dont l'usage ou la propriété correspond à la satisfaction de besoins."" (Wikipedia). La satisfaction d'un besoin est par définition positive.

&gt; &gt; C'est le but de tout travail.

&gt; Faux. Tu veux combien de contre exemples ?
&gt; Allez, par exemple les Kibboutz, dans lesquels il n'y a pas de salaire ni de propriété privée.

Ce n'est pas un contre exemple. Il y a bien eu travail pour créer de la richesse.

&gt; &gt; Sans richesse créée, il n'y a que de la misère matérielle.

&gt; Faux. De nombreuses sociétés fonctionnent sans objectif matériel. Tu peux par exemple prendre comme modèle ce que propose Pierre Rabhi, c'est à dire consommer le minimum pour avoir un impact minimum sur ton environnement.
&gt; Ou alors, fixer comme objectif un temps de travail minimum, comme dans les sociétés de chasseurs cueilleurs, où le temps de travail est de 4 à 5 heures par jour, et suffit amplement à nourrir toute la population.

On en revient à la définition de richesse. Il a bien fallu travailler pour produire ces richesses, même si la société leur accorde peu de valeur. Sans création de richesse, même les chasseurs-cueilleurs meurent de faim.

&gt; &gt; La richesse que je crée ne fait de mal à personne.

&gt; Dans le cas d'externalités négatives, par exemple la pollution, si.

Dans ce cas là, oui. Mais la famille qui achète son emballage plastique est quand même bien contente de pouvoir manger.

&gt; &gt; L'immense majorité des entreprises et des emplois ne sont pas lié à des actionnaires.

&gt; Source ?
