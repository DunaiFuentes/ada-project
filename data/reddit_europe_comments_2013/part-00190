true,callumgg,UKGB,Expat SPb,"&gt; Meanwhile Russia was always just hanging on the sidelines, intentionally staying out of European affairs and cultural advancements.

It wasn't really hanging on the sidelines, it was pushing further into Europe, violently at a lot of times. Europeanisation occurred heavily through the 1600s and 1700s with highlights being: introducing the Julian calendar, changing the alphabet, recruited top scientists and foreign workers, and of course, built Russia's new capital (St. Petersburg) deliberately close to (and modelled on) the Europe of the time. Additionally, territory acquired in modern day Estonia, Latvia, and Finland, brought Russia closer to the trade routes of central and Western Europe. 

After this, Russia was intricately linked with European affairs, far from shying away. Russia was a major player in the two world wars and the Napoleonic wars, as well as being the harbinger of communism (which took over half of Europe and created a divide to this day). 

Lastly, much of the traditional Rus empire and traditions are based on those handed down from Constantinople, and you can see them today mainly in religious iconography. Russia is *sometimes* described as the being the 'Third Rome', after Ivan III married his way into the Byzantine royals, and highlighted his country's faith to the Byzantine religion of Orthodoxy.",0,1378889831,null,0,false,0,cc62wbb,t3_1m3vic,t1_cc62wbb,t1_cc60xed,null,1429503213,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Marseille is older than Rome, it was a greek port a long time ago. Ever since it's been french, its identity has been forged in opposition to Paris. Marseille is, before anything, mediterranean.

true,Adventor,null,null,"I did network/system administration and consulting for a while, then switched to programming. From my own limited experience, admin jobs are lower paid and there are less of them than programming jobs. Also only big IT Companies will have really complex work for admins, the average smaller company tries to keep complexity (and wage) down by using system/network environments that are as simple as they can get away with. System/Network guys also seem to get treated less good. Seems like they have to deal with 24h-standby, evening and weekend work, etc way more often than programmers.

When I started with network/system administration (in a small company, big ones should be different) I had notions of analysing network dumps, optimizing stuff.. You can scrap all that in most companies. You will set up servers in a documented standard way. You will help setting up new clients, fix printer problems.. and if anything really difficult comes up, you will call for external help. Sure, you could solve that too, with time. But your time is expensive and its simply cheaper to get a external specialist who will know the solution in one glance than letting you build up knowledge about something that might never happen again.

Germany doesn't have all that many bigger IT companies. On the other side Germany DOES have really a lot of small programming companies consisting of 1-2 (lowpaid) admins and 20-200 programmers.

For me, finding a job in network/system administration was a bit of a challenge, there simply wasn't much on offer and I got best results by just sending out resumes without knowing of any job offering. Seems like a lot of companies are not actively searching for a systems guy, but will find work for one if a solid candidate shows up on its own.
For programming on the other side.. I looked for my favorite job offer, sent over my resume and got the job. I know of several others who had similar experiences. My (programmer) GF sent out resumes to 5 companies at once. She canceled her job interviews at company 4 and 5 after the first 3 companies offered her a contract right on the spot.

Closing note: These are my personal experiences as someone who studied CS and works in southern germany. If others experienced similar/different things I'd be interested in hearing them to get news from outside my personal filter bubble.

true,lliinnddsseeyy,null,null,"Hi there, fellow Michigander!

I don't know too much about engineering schools in Germany, but I will try my best to answer as many of your questions as I can. To start, life in Germany is very similar to life in the United States, with the exception that the German people are not so laid-back (although in Bavaria things are a little different). For example, when I was living in Bremen last year, I would be yelled at if I crossed the street before the light turned green, even if there were no cars coming. Yet when I would visit Munich, my friends and I would spend all day drinking in the English Gardens and all night in clubs, and no one cared because that's what everyone else did too. Germans can be very peculiar at times, especially depending on where you go. Americans are treated well, as long as you treat the country well in return. Europeans in general think it is very fun to talk about American politics- do not let this bother you. They will talk about things they do not understand as if they were born and raised in the states, they will make assumptions that are wildly untrue, and you will feel insulted at times. They also love to wear our flag, which is a never-ending source of amusement to me. But no, as an individual, you will be treated just like everybody else. It is also worth noting that there is a stereotype that Germans are very ""cold"" people.  This is not true! The correct word would be something closer to shy. Passing people on the street, it is like everyone has a goal that they are focused on and thus do not have time for you, but in the workplace/school/personal environments, Germans (for the most part) love to socialize, all you have to do is let them know you're interested. In terms of how fluent you should be...I would recommend at least taking a beginner's course either before you leave or as soon as you get there. All of the younger people in Germany speak at least some English, but you are going to look like a fool if you show up and expect everyone to be fluent in a language that is not their first. 

Companies I would look into if I were you: Airbus, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Siemens, and the Volkswagen Group.

Immigration for an American is not that difficult, all I had to do was make an appointment at the local immigration office, come in with a bank statement, proof of insurance, proof of a German bank account, my passport, and proof that I had registered with the city of Bremen, and they gave me my residence permit. That was as a student though, it may be a little more difficult to get a work permit as well. 

Re: Cost of living in Munich, if you are careful with your money, you will be fine. It is an expensive city, but you can overcome that pretty easily by keeping your priorities in order and not going out every night. I would definitely recommend looking into the program offered by your school, it would be a good ""test-drive"" of the country for you, I think. When going through a school there is also normally a lot more help and guidance than there would be otherwise, and you can never go wrong with a safety net :)

&gt; *Im Westen blieb die Wirtschaft noch bis Anfang 1950 instabil. Danach aber wurde klar, wie viele Menschen vom Kaliber der Schickedanz es gab. Herbert Quandt baute BMW auf, Reinhard Mohn schuf den Bertelsmann-Konzern, und Karl und Theo Albrecht machten Aldi groß. Sie alle stehen für das Wirtschaftswunder, das den politischen Neubeginn absicherte und die Bundesrepublik binnen zehn Jahren zur zweitgrößten Wirtschaftsmacht der Welt aufsteigen ließ.*

Kriegsverbrecher (Quandt) und Propaganda-Konzerne (Bertelsmann) als Fleißbeispiele loben, aber den wahren Grund für den Aufschwung, den Koreakrieg (Korea-Boom), schön verschweigen. Wäre ja blöd, sich mal den Fakten zu widmen und das schöne Märchen vom fleißigen ""Wirtschaftswunder""-schaffenden Arbeiter endlich ad acta zu legen.

&gt; *Zeitgleich begann die Karriere von Ludwig Erhard. Seit 20 Jahren schon hatte der Ökonom fleißig und unauffällig über Fragen der Marktordnung und der Preisbindung nachgedacht. [...] Am Tag der Währungsreform verkündete er ohne Absprache mit den Alliierten die Aufhebung jeglicher staatlicher Bewirtschaftung oder Preisbindung. Nicht zuletzt diese Courage, sich über die Oberbefehlshaber hinwegzusetzen, machte ihn für die Westdeutschen zu einer Vaterfigur. Weder die Verkündung des Grundgesetzes am 23. Mai 1949 noch die konstituierende Sitzung des Bundestages in Bonn haben sie so beeindruckt wie das neue Geld und die wieder gefüllten Auslagen der Geschäfte. Der 21. Juni 1948 wurde zum gefühlten Gründungstag der neuen Republik.*

So, [Le petit bordelais](http://www.le-petit-bordelais.fr/#), without any doubt. The chef was in a restaurant which had a Michelin star, and then created his own. This is truly amazing french cuisine, and it's not as expensive as the restaurants in the Michelin guide: the 70€ tasting menu (that I recommend) has five courses, four glasses of wine (which are chosen to go well with the courses), and everything is incredibly good. The chef is very nice (once, they had to cancel my reservation because of a computer-related problem - the next time, they offered us champagne) too.

If you care more about the experience than the food itself, I can also recommend the [Bel Canto](http://www.lebelcanto.com/accueil.php?langue=1) (they also have a restaurant at Londres if you're from here). The idea is that the waiters and waitresses are also opera singers, so they sing classic opera songs every 15 minutes (or so) during the evening (you still have time for chatting). I've already invited someone here without telling her anything, so we started ordering and chatting, and suddenly, a waitress with an amazing voice started to sing La Traviata. That's quite an awesome surprise ^^ The setting is truly beautiful, and the atmosphere is great.

You're not wrong to guess that Russia will push the buffer countries towards the West. However, I think, that there is an explanation *why* Russia is acting like this, and why it's not exactly right to call them stupid.

The thing is, that currently there is a huge geopolitical game going on between Russia and the EU. The prize of this game is expanding (or keeping) spheres of influence into several post-Soviet states, these being Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Armenia. Up until now these countries managed to manoeuvre between interests of Russia and Europe with greater or lesser success.

But situation like this cannot continue forever, as Russia is creating the Eurasian Union, which will have unified market, similar to the one in the EU. In the light of this development, EU decided that now is a good time to act by offering these unaffiliated post-Soviet states to sign association agreements in November. These agreements would allow the countries in question to start free trade with the EU and would also pave the way for future EU membership. A very important thing is that after signing this agreement further integration into the Russian zone would be impossible.

That's why Russia cannot do anything else, but to play all the cards they have. Trade sanctions and threats to limit gas supply are just means to try to scare the countries from signing the agreements in November. There are also other ways, as forcing their influence on the politicians, or using regional tensions. They have successfully done this in Armenia, as Armenians already announced that they are joining the Eurasian Union.

It's not that Russia doesn't understand that carrot is better than bat. They simply have run out of options in Moldova, and are trying to use trade sanctions as a mean of last resort, even while understanding that they don't hold much chance anymore.

La posizione dei due preti che hanno dato buca a Belen è, sostanzialmente, questa: siccome in questo matrimonio l'elemento extra-sacramentale incide più di quello sacramentale e siccome, libretto di istruzioni del cattolicesimo alla mano, per la Chiesa l'unica cosa che conta nel matrimonio è che gli sposi si accostino al sacramento, qui non se ne fa più niente. Posizione onesta (il sacramento è tuo e te lo regoli come ritieni), che però il problema degli altri matrimoni me lo configura. Perché lo sappiamo benissimo che la stragrande maggioranza dei matrimoni che ogni giorno vengono celebrati in chiesa sono i matrimoni di gente che lo fa essenzialmente per conformismo, che del sacramento gliene frega il giusto e grasso che cola se fanno battezzare i figli. Merluzzoni comuni che magari al contrario dei due merluzzoni famosi saranno stati ligi con le date e i formalismi, ma che quanto a effettivo interesse nel sacramento stanno più o meno lì. Tutto questo per tacere che a far saltare il matrimonio per una roba così io non mi ci vedo nemmeno un parroco vandeano e legittimista, figurarsi il prete giovane e fico noto in città come Don Spritz.

Il motivo per cui i preti danno buca è un altro. Ovvero che - chi l'avrebbe mai detto - il matrimonio in questione sarà tra due tamarri della tv, a loro volta circondati da altri tamarri della tv.

Eh. So how does that work. They borrow the money from the pensions but call it differently so that it doesn't get counted as debt? Either that, or they steal the money. That can work too you know. Stealing has proven to be highly profitable to some people.

A fun anecdote on telecoms complaining about regulation. Before 2007, Italian telecoms had a curious practice: whenever you topped up your traffic (prepaid was almost universal back then) you'd pay a ""top-up fee"" of about 1-3€. Top-up 10€? get 8€ in phone traffic, 2€ goes to the service fee. You can see how this was pure profit, considering the marginal cost of each top-up transaction is practically zero.

When the government moved to outlaw this outrageous and hugely unpopular practice, our telecoms went WILD. They cried and complained that it would destroy their profit margins, that they needed time to adjust, that this would kill the industry or set it back years. The government ignored them and went ahead.

Now, six years later, our telecoms are as healthy as ever; they've modernized services, are offering competitive plans and a wide variety of subsidized phones.

Shame on him, you, and those that voted for him.

That's not to say that the book shouldn't be read, but when you pick up the book of *the* generation's academic known Stalin apologist who justifies genocide, and says it would be justified again if if brought about the end of nation states, then you pick it up with gravitas.  When the author himself admits that he revised or knowingly doesn't mention large parts of controversial history then you don't say that it is a blueprint to your understanding of that history, rather an insight into the argument of the time.

This is the President of the Parliament who it looks like is going to be running for President of the Commission -  and a self admitted federalist - holding up a book that argues that it is justifiable to lie, misdirect, kill and overthrow to meet your political goals.  An author who claimed total commitment to an authoritarian cause, to the extent that it would have complete control and priority over personal life, even who he dated if the movement wished it.  Complete unswerving loyalty to the party,

Classy.

**Now watch what the President is aligning himself with, when we're talking about millions dying and the gulag classes being liquidated, and wait for the 'probably not' because it wasn't ultimately successful - and the 'sacrifices at the time' i.e. genocide, was only marginally worth while according to the author:**

So the two of you don't get along even for a single month after you moved in?

There is no way us folks on the internet could know if that's mostly your fault or his. I can somewhat sympathize with him: you moved in to the place where he had previously been living alone (or with a different roommate who was probably his buddy) and all of a sudden things just aren't the way he wants them to be anymore. That's not your fault, of course, but we certainly can't tell you if he is actually an asshole or if the two of you just weren't meant to be roommates. Don't look where to put the blame, simply move out.

The text g0dy suggested is good; although given the circumstances, I think you can be more personal, a little less formal.

Throw up the personal attack, then I'm going to make you think twice about exactly what side you're defending and why you should inform yourself first and comment second.

I could have easily set about the book binder from Aachen, his temper, what he's done and what he advocates - but this submission wasn't about that.  I could have taken the lead from the comment I responded to and argued at length about the connection they made, all backed up with sources and citations a plenty as I have done on many occasions before - but this submission wasn't about that either.

This submission was about the terrible effects of Stalinism, and to my mind the mission creep that lead there, a point raised by the comment I replied to.  How blinkered people can end up doing and supporting something so terrible.  I didn't want to say it.  I wanted people to see it. 

I threw a breadcrumb trail because until you see it for yourself you won't believe it.  The only difference is that I had to shock you that that you were about to paddle in the waters of ethnic cleansing before you opened up Wikipedia to check what was there.

This person doesn't give a damn about you, a damn about the rules, a damn about democracy or its directly  democratically elected representatives - he openly flaunts and derides them.  Like Hobsbawm he can, in his own mind, justify the costs and the harm in furthering the political agenda, and once committed it becomes too costly to step back.  Hobsbawm argued that the cost was only too high because the end result wasn't successful - so we have an insight into Schulz's mindset.  If the crisis gets worse, or however bad things get, he can always justify going that extra step further or squeezing that little bit harder if it means there's a political flower garden as he sees it as an end result.

Now look up the treatment of the Czech's Vaclav Klaus, and put that into context of the Irish referendum, or the appointment of Mario Monti in Italy, or how Lisbon was signed in, or the freezing of a common currency in Cyprus,..

Look them all up.

No, I have laid out scores of cited and sourced comments across Reddit's political treads and received virtually nil in comparison.  It's breadcrumbs first and smack second from now on until the quality improves or people start thinking for themselves.   If people don't think that's justified, or perhaps a little excessive condemnation, the President of the Parliament just had his photo taken reading a known apologist for Stalinism when we have post Soviet countries in the EU, they put the photo in the lobby of the parliament and none of the mainstream political classes or media said anything.  They didn't even make the link.  Think about it.   We're sleepwalking!

There are a number of allegations regarding Ryanair work practices, by some of the more salient do actually go in those direction.

For instance, whether she was paid below what the law allows depends on what is the relevant law: Ryanair (or rather, its subcontractors, because Ryanair hardly employs anybody directly) employ people on Irish work contracts, even when those people are actually based far from Ireland. So, for instance, when Ryanair was denounced for such practices in Marseilles, [it just left](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/09/ryanair-marseille-employment-row-contracts).

""Did Ryanair refuse to pay her?""

According to some sources, Ryanair only pays its cabin crew for the actual flying hours, not for the time the plane is on the ground, even if the crew is indeed working (for instance, boarding passengers). Also, apparently, Ryanair charges its staff steep fees for items such as training, or even the uniforms.

The main difference being that in a customs union all duties and tariffs are harmonized between all the members, so that they form one trade area. This is not the case in FTAs.

Once you are in a customs union, you cannot independently take part in FTAs, as this would mean that you could import goods into the customs union at a lower cost than other members of the union, thus giving you an unfair advantage. This is why the EU negotiates trade agreements on behalf of all its member states.

This difference between an FTA and a customs union is something that many people are unfortunately unaware of, which is why you'll often hear EU sceptics argue ""Why can't the EU just be about free trade agreements?"". This is not possible since a true inner market requires harmonized rules, laws and tariffs. This also in turn requires institutions to uphold these, which is why the EU has developed to be as extensive as it is today.

She answered by not answering. My chief got into her bureau and laughed her ass off and I was pretty lost because she didn't bother to give me an answer. Funny thing is that she used ""du"" for me and everyone else.

We were constantly understaffed becaused the head office's incentive programs meant managers got bonuses if they employed less people. I was paid £5 per hour despite minimum wage being about £6.30.

But back to the topic... what happened in 20th century was quite different in scale. Firstly, the ability of the society to cope with the influx was overwhelmed; secondly, the colonists were supported by a massive foreign state apparatus that literally gave them preferential treatment.; thirdly they were, technically, the majority in the USSR so the state was expecting everyone within it to become Russians instead. We'd had a case of erstwhile herrenvolk losing their position before — in the very beginning of 20th century when the Baltic Germans went through it.

&gt;[The elections of 1989](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_legislative_election,_1989) had been the first opportunity since 1939 for Poles to freely express their political beliefs by electing their officials. Poland was one of the first countries in the Eastern block where the political opposition had some sort of real power. In order to change Polish constitution, you had(and still have) to have 66% of votes in Sejm(the lower house). As the solidarity won every single one of electable seats(35%) in the lower house, they could block attempts of the government to disadvantage Solidarity and other political groups.


&gt;The outcome of these elections clearly showed what the people thought. Out of 161 electable seats in the lower house, 161 were won by the Solidarity. In senate, the upper house of the parliament, 99 out of 100 were won by Solidarity and the remaining one was won by an independent candidate. These elections were amongst the first steps in the Eastern block which led to the fall of the communism. On 27 October 1991, the first free elections since the mid-war period took place in Poland. Mind you that it was about two weeks before the Berlin Wall fell.

&gt;As you can see there are three flags in the poster. The first one is fully red, and has 0% written underneath it. It symbolises the communist Poland up until the elections, 0% of political freedom. The second flag slowly emerges from  the red - showing the start of changes. 35% refers to the electable seats in Sejm. The last flag is clearly the current Polish flag - it shows 100%, political freedom. Please note that this flag is not disconnected from the red rectangle - Poles can not forget the communism times, as it was part of our history. The red colour on our flag, as  might mean blood spilled by the communist governments, but also bravery and a will to put up a fight.

[At high noon on the 4th of June 1989](http://i.imgur.com/9ouRvRb.jpg) 

&gt;The note Gary Cooper is holding says ""elections"".
The inscription at the bottom says:

&gt;High noon (At the high noon)

&gt;4th June 1989 //elections date

&gt;The author wanted a contrast - good versus bad - Westerns from the 50s were keenly watched, because it was the time censorship was loosened. If you've seen the movie, you can clearly divide people in two groups - the good ones - including the Sheriff, and the bad ones - including bandits he fought. The man was easily recognizable, the title of the movie he starred in could be used in the given context - If you removed Solidarność and the date at the bottom as well as the piece of paper he's holding, you would get a movie poster. The author states that ""He [the sheriff] had to be a widely recognised person, able to handle the situation"".

&gt;The poster wasn't meant to be mass printed either - the artist made 4 copies on his own, and then he couldn't find anybody willing to print it, as the poster was deemed by various Solidarity members to be ""too aggressive"". By sheer luck one man accepted his poster, sent it to France, where it was copied, and the posters returned to Poland at the midnight of 3/4 June 1989.

More and more of them are better and better integrated every year, and we're trying to bring the last of the resisters out of their self-imposed ghettoes. Oh, and some lock themselves out from the wider society willfully, by refusing to learn the ""dog languague"" despite having lived here for generations.

Hell, nearly all Baltic Germans had a good command of Estonian languague even _before_ we first became independent in 1918. There are stories about Baltic German officers in Imperial Russian army (for example) using it between themselves to keep the content of their discussions secret;)

Thing is, Estonians are nationalists — but it's largely cultural nationalism, not ethnic nationalism (we're mongrels), or state nationalism (haven't had one for long), or whatever.

At the moment the plurality party is the EPP : the European People's Party. This is mainly Christian democrats and conservatives - for example Berlusconi, Merkel, Sarkozy and most of the leadership of the EU at present. The only notable exception is the UK Conservatives who left because they considered the group too Europhillic

S&amp;D are the social democrats and Labour parties, and the primary opposition to the EPP. They had a rotten last election and would love to recover and regain control of the EU's legislature.

ALDE are an alliance of liberals and centrists. It's kind of all over the place - some parties are right-wing ultra free-market and practically American libertarians. Others are more cuddly socially liberals. They include the Lib Dems, the Irish Fianna Fail, the German FDP and any party with the word ""centre"" in their name.

Greens/EFA are the fourth-largest party- mostly Green parties in a weird alliance with left-wing nationalists like the Scottish and Welsh Nationalists.

Pretty much the same size are the Conservatives and Reformists - who are more Eurosceptic than EPP and is pretty much dominated by David Cameron's Conservatives. They oppose federalism of the EU.

A bit smaller, the European United Left are socialists and commnists - Sinn Fein in Ireland, Die Linke in Germany, Syriza in Greece etc. These are opponents of neoliberals and Third Way politics in general and so are constantly are at loggerheads with S&amp;D who are seen as too moderate.

Finally we have the Europe of Freedom and Democracy which is constantly changing its name and status. This is populist right-wing stuff, lots of opposition to ""political correctness"" and to the EU itself. Led by Nigel Farage's UKIP, the Northen League of Italy and a bunch of smaller parties.

Oh yeah and the non-inscruits - which are mainly parties so far off to the right (normally) that even EFD won't take them in - the BNP, Golden Dawn, the French Front and Hungarian Jobbik.

In left-wing to right-wing:

EUL (commies) - Greens (environment) - S&amp;D (workers)- ALDE (liberty) - EPP (christian democracy) - ECR (conservatism) - EFD (national identity) - non-inscruits (insanity)

I find with me knowing German I can:
1. Live in Germany, travel and experience the culture and language that is often not as obvious to someone that is not that interested in German. Sometime just sitting on a bus and hearing how people make a sound or speak a word that I wouldn't use is just something that bring joy to my day.
2. Deutsch ist die Sprache der Dichter und Denker. Sure you can read Kant, Einstein, Kafka or Goethe in other languages but a 1-1 translation is never the same. Little things such as a rhyme, onomatopoeia or just the sound of a word may be lost in translation. I love reading, but if you don't it is still something to consider.

3. Certain TV shows I enjoy are only in German: Tatort, Genial daneben. I don't watch much German shows but I do even enjoy the German dubbed HIMYM, Big Bang Theory etc. There are other special shows like DSDS or Bauer sucht Frau if you like those things.

4. In learning a foreign language you also learn more about your own language, about words that are taken from that other language. German would make a great starting point for other Germanic languages.

**Verbindungen**

This is kind of a collective term. Kinda like frat. Although some Corps-Studenten might take affront, in general it's what is used to describe all forms together.

**Burschenschaften**

Founded in the early 19th century and the origin of many of the modern forms of Verbindungen. They were often poltical, taking a stand for a national German state when no such thing could exist. During the 19th century they were often seen as a hotbed of radical political action and as such often forbidden. After WWII they've kind of kept their nationalistic ideas and as such are often seen as more right-wing organizations. There have recently also been some scandals involving racism and nazi ideology in the DB-Dachverband, which is the largest organization for all the different chapters. Many individual Burschenschaften have left the DB because of this. That being said, and although they are generally probably more conservative than your average student, I have met many great Burschenschaftler that weren't Neo-Nazis or assholes of any other kind.

They also all wear *coleur* (that means those bands) and most of them also practice [Academic fencing].(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_fencing)

**Corps**
Came about when officers after the Napoleonic wars began to study and wanted a form of organization similar to in the military. Today they are, like most Verbindungen, similar in structure. They have a strict principle of political and religious neutrality. They fence and carry colors and are often some of the oldest fraternieties in the city.

Just from personal experience (and even though corps vary between different ones) they usually drink more, are stricter and have better manners. They do tend to carry a kind of elitist attitude towards most other Verbindungen and being in a Corps (excluding everyones favorite, the green ones) is usually significantly more expensive, since you need to own a couple of suits, a tux, have to pay for all kinds of expeditions etc.

**Landsmannschaften**

They are the product of the oldest form of organization of students. Back when it was difficult for students to travel across Germany and they were all from different states, people from the same state would band together in the towns and cities they were studying in. I can't really say that much about them today. They fence, drink a ton and there really are not that many left.

**The Others**

I am going to group the rest in here, because, although they usually make up the majority of frats in a given city, they are varied. There are the religious ones, split between KStV(Katholischer Studenten Verein or short KV), KDStV (Katholisch Deutscher Studenten Verein or short CV), and Wingolf. The first two are catholic, coming from a time when there was a widespread distrust against catholics (see Ultramontanismus and Bismarck), while the Wingolf is nondenominational. Almost all wear color and none of them fence. Drinking varies from frat to frat as does the attention to the religious aspect.

The VdST(Verein deutscher Studenten) ist probably the most colorless among them all. They have copied many of the traditions of other fraternities but have neither history, fencing or religion to unite them. Sadly, this seems to lead to excessive drinking (at least the ones I know). They were founded under a nationalistic goal around the turn of the century and morphed into the organization that the Nazi regime imposed on students. Today they have distanced themselves from their past and are politically neutral.

Saengerschaften and Turnerschaften are rare, but they exist. Most fraternities sing, the Saengerschaften just wanted a bigger focus on it. Some of them wear colour, some of the fence, its quite a hodgepodge. The term Saengerschaften really does not tell you too much about it, except that they sing.

Students were also caught up in the fitness craze of the 19th century, spawned by Turnvater Jahn. While many of the fraternities simply started doing sports together, some made that their unifying principle. Today they too vary greatly. Some still do a ton of sports. Some just drink to excess. Some fence, some don't etc. etc. Again, the name doesn't really denote that much.

I don't know what you mean with Gesellschaften, so I'm just gonna skip that one. If you have any other questions, feel free to fire away, I'll do my best to answer.

in the beginning up to the late 19th century it was very common that the students trained fighting skills especially fencing for various reasons. (Depending on the rules of the society you've joined). 
Between several societies there have been rivalvry so that students participated in (often illegal) duels or fighting events. (You know manly stuff like ""Who is the best?!"" ... ) This part of the historic student societies is very big so that it would require it's own thread to bring up every detail.

As far as the fencing goes, it needs to be understood in historical context. When this first started, in the middle ages, students were one of the very few people who were allowed to bear arm. If you needed to travel 500km on foot through thick german forests to another Uni because that one book you wanted to read was there and if you had all your money for 4 weeks in a little bag on your person, you're a great target for bandits. So the original Verbindungen trained their members in the use of said weapons. Over time, that fighting became highly ritualized and in a society where it was expected to fight to redeem your honor if you thought you had been slighted or disrepected, the students of course participated.

Most students that fence today justify it either straightways with some kind of shtick about manliness etc. while others simply say that it forges the Verbindung together and serves as a test of self for the individual.

As to whether it actually did - I don't recall any ""threats made to businesses"", the courts ruled that the various McKenna/Coughlan etc rules had been observed, and the only foreign group I recall actually getting involved was UKIP - on the No side, obviously, and they were probably one of the bigger positives for the Yes side. We still don't know where Declan Ganley's money came from in Lisbon 1, but that doesn't seem to be an issue for the No people.

And since the effect of the claims that such things were happening was to make people reluctant to change to a Yes, I have to say that if the No side *didn't* make up those claims then they were missing a huge opportunity. But since they didn't miss any other opportunities to make stuff up, that doesn't seem that likely.

Most famous poster here might be the one of [Merkel](https://sphotos-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/s403x403/1150307_10151678824005415_414141164_n.jpg). It says ""Collectively successful"" but can easily be turned into [""einsam reich""](http://i1.wp.com/www.testspiel.de/wp-content/uploads/einsam-reich.jpg?resize=319%2C425) (""lonely rich"") or ""gemein reich"" (""mean/vile rich""), ""mein Erfolg"" (""my success"") and of course the most classy [""mein Reich""](http://konsumpf.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Mein-Reich-Angela-Merkel.jpg). Basically you can chose between ""gemein/einsam/mein"" in the first row and ""erfolg/reich"" in the second row - but can create a lot more by simply adding or altering some letter(s).

One SPD poster usually looks like [this](http://www.pantomime-popkultur.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Wahlplakat-2013-Eva-H%C3%B6gel-SPD.jpg) (""The *we* decides"" - sorry that's stupid to translate because it doesn't even makes much sense in german. Supposed meaning is something like ""we decide together""),

posters from the greens look like [this](http://www.gruene.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Bilder/Wahlplakate2013/plakat-energieriese_540x370.jpg) (""I'm going to be a energy giant - and you?""),

posters by the FDP like [this](http://www.fdp.de/files/5030/130704_FDP_Kandidatenplakat_Br_derle.jpg) (""So that Germany stays strong""),

posters by the Left like [this](http://www.designtagebuch.de/wp-content/uploads/mediathek//2013/08/themenplakat-3-die-linke-bundestagswahl-2013.jpg) (""Enough jabbering: 10€ minimum wage now!""),

posters by the pirates like [this](https://piratenpartei-bayern.de/files/2013/06/LTW_Mein_Leben_Meine_Daten.jpg) (""My life - my data: ""Every human being has a private sphere that has to be free of surveillance.

Cela m'amuse souvent de voir le Français moyen s'exclamer ""Enfin une Eglise qui évolue et qui sort de ses préceptes rétrogrades!"" devant ce genre d'article, avec une pointe de condescendance. 

Or ce type de réaction ne fait que démontrer l'ignorance du citoyen lambda, car en effet, l'Eglise n'a jamais caché qu'elle pouvait revenir sur le célibat des prêtres, en estimant toutefois que ce célibat avait encore son utilité.

Le pape François améliore considérablement l'image et la communication du Vatican, mais qu'on arrête de présenter comme des nouveautés radicales ce qui fait partie de la doctrine ou des préceptes de l'Eglise depuis des lustres (le pire étant ""enfin un pape qui se soucie des pauvres !"", comme si Benoît XVI avait été le ""pape des riches""). 

Sur le même principe, il est écrit noir sur blanc dans le Catéchisme de l'Eglise catholique qu'il faut respecter et accueillir les personnes homosexuelles, or les déclarations récentes du pape sur le mode ""it's okay to be gay"" sont décrites dans les médias comme un changement de position du Saint-Siège...

L'Eglise doit sûrement améliorer sa com', mais il faudrait aussi que le Français moyen s'intéresse un minimum à ce que croit et proclame concrètement le Vatican !

If you want a view, don't waste time and money going to the top of the Eiffel tower (just go see the tower, maybe have a picnic in the lawn in front of it... maybe do that at sunset.  it sparkles every hour on the hour after sunset.  it's neat.).  Unless you are just obsessed with the idea of going to the top.  Do the top of the Arc de Triomphe instead.  Or Tour Montparnasse.  Sacre Coeur also has a pretty fantastic view.  Plus the church is beautiful and very different from Notre Dame or Sainte Chappelle (both gorgeous cathedrals).

I don't have much advice for non touristy stuff.  There is so much good touristy stuff to keep busy with, we didn't get a chance to do much else!  But I really really enjoyed just wandering around and getting lost.  What I did was pick something to do/see like Sacre Coeur.  Go there, see it, then just pick a direction and start walking.  If I got hungry, I would just walk into a place that had good smells coming from it or I would bounce around reading the menus posted outside until something sounded good to me.  I walked into any church that had it's doors unlocked.  Made some interesting discoveries.  A lot of times you can catch the organists or choirs practicing and the never seemed to mind if you just walked in and sat in the back to listen.  When I got tired, I would just duck down into the first metro station I came upon, check out the map, then I was on my way back to the hotel.

Don't make that the only place you go to.  (Definitely don't miss out on the absolutely fantastic French bakeries and pastry shops!)  You have to get out and try new, French things.  But it might help if you have a place you can go to for a taste of home if you're going to be in France for an extended period.  The place seems to attract a number of American ex-pats.

Speaking as a Spanish citizen who doesn't have a firm stance on the matter (other than they should decide by themselves), I can tell that the difference between now and any point in the past is that for the first time Catalans see independence as a real possibility that they may live to see with their own eyes, unlike before when it seemed like an unreachable utopia.

It also needs to be said that the only reason the situation has come to this point is because of the conflict-seeking attitude by the central power (maybe out of a misguided pride or sense of superiority, maybe out of the need for creating an artificial enemy for electoral purposes, probably a mix of both).

Unfortunately, it is left to the votes of politicians and the general public...many of who are not scientifically educated, are biased, or greatly misinformed about these field (not to mention the lobbyists and special interest groups spending millions to try and sway the general opinion in their favor for whatever reasons). These are not exactly the type of people qualified to make such decisions in my opinion. 

Here's a somewhat silly example of what I mean: after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and more recently the Fukishima disaster, many of the United States nuclear reactors lost funding and shut down. Nuclear scientists and engineers had an extremely hard time getting grants for research. They began calling themselves ""particle scientists"", ""subatomic scientists"", ""high energy scientists"" because of the stigma associated the word ""nuclear"". The American public is absolutely terrified of the word and will not vote for anything with ""nuclear"" in the title or description. This is actually why we have MRI machines and not NMRI machines. The correct term is ""Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging"", but they decided to drop the N term due to public fear of anything nuclear. This is only scratching the surface, but I hope you can begin to see the problem many US scientists are facing when seeking funding. Someone needs to slap some good old fashioned enlightenment into these people!",0,1378941805,null,0,1378943677,0,cc6i4xc,t3_1m547q,t1_cc6i4xc,t1_cc62u6b,null,1429496022,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Afirejar,GERM,Germany,"&gt; UN-members are under the jurisdiction of the ICJ in matters of human rights and international law

First of all that's wrong. Only some UN-members have declared that they would regard ICJ jurisdiction as compulsory. Those that did can just withdraw that declaration. Additionally, there is no way to enforce a ruling short of war, and no one is going to war with Spain over Catalonia.

Second, the ICJ is a court that arbitrates between states. The only way for Catalans to be able to sue in front of the ICJ on this matter is to get international recognition for their independent nation first, and then sue for not having been recognized when it actually mattered - i.e. only when it would be completely pointless.

Third, governments can't override their nation's constitution. That's kind of the point of having one. I doubt ""we can't do this, but we can empower someone else to empower us to do this"" is going to fly in the Tribunal Constitucional, or any other constitutional court.

For an example of the power of the ICJ see Nicaragua v. United States, where Nicaragua obtained a judgment against the US over the latter's support of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. The US ignored the court's decision, so the only thing that ever came of it was a UN resolution calling for compliance with the judgment, which the US then also ignored.

Edit: For completeness sake: They could theoretically sue at the European Court of Justice or the European Court of Human Rights, but it would be pointless because neither EU law nor the European Human Rights Convention recognize a right to secede and form an independent nation. If they did, those courts would have the same issues of enforcement and government-granted unconstitutional powers, but that's a moot point.",0,1378946722,null,0,1378947821,0,cc6jt2z,t3_1m6n1n,t1_cc6jt2z,t1_cc6h8st,null,1429495242,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,observer,EURO,European Union,"&gt; That's for a gross income of 100,000 dollars. Does Greece even have any wage earners that get wages that high? If you look at the tax revenue per GDP figure, you'll see a completely different picture.

Tax revenue per GDP is irrelevant. Says little about taxes and more about the effectiveness of your tax collection mechanism (which as we know is problematic, to put it extremely mildly). Provided of course that we aren't talking about a tax heaven which I don't imagine you can argue Greece is. As for effective tax rate yes it is for those who make a gross 5000€/month (if you divide by 14) and usually 'gross' means that after -compulsory- social security, solidarity tax etc your bank account ends up with a net sum of less than 3000€/month. So you are saying these (arguably middle-class and/or upper middle class) guys are taxed more than anywhere (bar Belgium) so the implication is that working class people and lower middle class should pay more taxes? I'd find it hard to believe that anyone would agree with you on this. Moreover, in order to undermine the utility of the chart, you seem to make the case that -unlike other countries shown in that chart- we tax the haves more than other countries and thus the chart is not indicative for taxation of the lower economic strata. In other words, yes we have high taxes but only for those in the middle class and above; a rather very progressive tax system. Let alone that I doubt that you can provide evidence that this is the case, would that be a bad thing for you? I'm imagining you are coming from a position that would cherish a progressive taxation system. All that said, the indicator that you brought up (tax revenue per GDP) that is relatively low for a developed country goes to show that a LOT needs to be done towards the direction of cracking down on tax evasion and I can only imagine that you'll agree. What I don't agree with is that those that pay the 100% of what they're supposed to pay in taxes (either willingly or because simply they cannot evade due to the nature of their incomes) should be taxed more. If anything, for growth's sake taxes should be drastically reduced (and for that matter get simplified too).

&gt; let me answer your question honestly: If Greece could somehow magically continue spending as it did in 2009, the crisis would be over way faster. But obviously this was not possible because of the euro (and if we did not have the euro, we'd have to pay with inflation but maybe that would have too been better than the current mess).

Well, agreed, if someone kept pumping artificially (since our economy doesn't 'produce' that extra money in any way) 20bn euros/year in the Greek economic system we'd probably have recovered by now. I appreciate your answer but I beg to differ on whether a recovery of nominal GDP or even recovery in unemployment figures should be a priority at all costs (devaluation, inflation which can only result in -among other things- leaving rotten/unproductive structures intact). Of course the issue is very complex so we'd have to settle for agreeing to disagree. 

&gt; But the state hasn't really protected public sector jobs, because the number of public servants has greatly decreased. And the wages decreased in the end. So, what does it matter to fire more people now?

Firing people and not renewing temp jobs (that clearly stated a specific employment period in their contracts) are two different things. By your standard all preceding govts have 'laid off' hundreds of thousands of public workers in the course of the last decades (and unfortunately replaced them with new ones). And the ones that will be fired in the end will be replaced on a one-for-one basis through ASEP procedures. If what you say happens we can always come back to this (and I'd be happy if it happens) :)

&gt; I do find it very ideological and I don't think it has enough evidence to support that compared to Greece Latvia did harsher austerity on the expenditure side and that is the reason for their rebound. You have like one sample and you cherry pick the indicators you think are important. That's not very scientific.

That is fair enough I guess. It's coming from a source that is clear about its political/economic allegiance however the numbers used are available from any source you may find legitimate and they all show one thing: austerity of this kind (big cuts in spending, reducing the state while not increasing taxes) works if done rightly. What counts as 'rightly' is of course up for debate but whatever. I'm assumming we'll have to agree that we disagree on this too since -no matter what a set of 6 or 56 indicators may say- no two countries are exactly comparable so as to arrive at what you called 'scientific' conclusions.",0,1378948481,null,0,false,0,cc6kezt,t3_1lwqcq,t1_cc6kezt,t1_cc5g42s,null,1429494958,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

And the only advance in self government of Euskadi (Basque Country) over Catalonia is that they control a fair amount of taxing. Catalonia has more control over other issues of government like the language used in schools. In Catalonia the language used in schools is primarily Catalan and in Euskadi is Spanish except in a special schools called Ikastolas.

The effect is that many more people use Catalan in their daily lives in Catalonia vs Euskara in Euskadi.

By the way, the Catalan school system has been recognized as a model of integration by many European institutions.

The propaganda of the New Europe was managed by [Walter Hallstein](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F004665-0003%2C_Walter_Hallstein.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F004665-0003%2C_Walter_Hallstein.jpg), a Nazi lawyer, who accompanied Hitler on his trip to Italy in 1938, where they met with Mussolini to discuss the details of this New Europe.

At the end of the war, Hallstein was captured by the Americans and sent to a prisoner camp in Mississipi. In 1948, he spent a year as visiting professor at the Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. [(does Operation Paperclip ring a bell ?)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip).

Hallstein [signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957](http://www.eu-facts.org/en/images/adenauer_hallstein.jpg), became the first President of the European Commission, and was awarded the Karlspreis. Other recipients of the prize include Monnet, Schuman, Spaak, Kissinger, Clinton ([the first three were financed by US spy chiefs and were considered as employees by the Americans)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1356047/Euro-federalists-financed-by-US-spy-chiefs.html)

Maybe one can now understand why De Gaulle didn't really like having an ex-Nazi and puppets telling him France must become part of a supranational Europe. 

He did predict, when there were only 6 states, that it wouldn't be possible, on important national matters, for a foreign minority to impose its will on a majority . Thus, since no policy could've been made, all the states would follow the policy of an outsider, who had a policy, but we wouldn't be talking about the European Union anymore, it would be something much larger and spread out.

Every country, even in Europe, has its own problems. Many European countries aren't exactly big on immigration.

The Irish can be kind of caustic to immigrants, Travellers, and outsiders (though usually it's more the knackers who act that way). Other European countries will have their own social issues (just like any other country), which a lot of Americans don't always realize. They think 'oh, it's Europe- they've got great health care and sane laws, they must be awesome' when the reality can leave a lot to be desired.

true,TarantusaurusRex,null,null,"Everyone has his/her own opinion about where to stay in Paris, where to live, or where to avoid. The best thing that you can do is research the neighborhoods and decide what sounds appealing or family-friendly. 

Montmarte is charming, but keep in mind that Pigalle is more or less in Montmartre, and west of the Pigalle metro station, Blvd. Clichy is lined with sex shops. I don't think it compares to, say, the red light district of Amsterdam, but when evening falls, the big neon signs advertising all things ""EROTIQUE"" will light up, and you will see some shady characters seep out of doorways and alleys (although it remains pretty touristy). If you have children and you don't want them to be exposed to that sort of ambiance, then don't stay there. Visit Montmartre and the Moulin Rouge during the day if that's on your list of sights to see. 

Montmartre is also very tourist-heavy, and, for me, it really took away from the magic of Paris. I loved to traverse the hill up to Sacré-Coeur and wander the little streets and shops in the off-season, but if you're planning your trip for the tourist season, Montmartre will be a hectic frenzy of slow tourists with cameras and accents and frustratingly impolite behavior. The people who own shops and restaurants in the area are fairly jaded due to all of the tourist activity. But hell, everyone in Paris is jaded. 

When I visited the first time, I stayed aaalll the way up in the 19th at metro télégraphe. It's quite a ways from the city center, but I still had a really great time and I was able to navigate the city by metro with ease. I am not necessarily telling you to stay up there, but keep in mind that you don't have to stay in the hot spots of Paris in order to have a good time and see everything that you want to see. Just make sure that the nearby metro line is convenient.

I'd recommend that you try to stay in arrondissements 1-11 which would optimize your ability to travel by foot and get to places in a timely fashion. But the 19th is fine, too, depending. There is Parc des Buttes Chaumont and great Chinese food at a good price because it's Belleville. I disagree with /u/TurboBlaze. Staying in the 19th or 20th around metro stations Belleville, Pyrénées, and Jourdain is perfectly acceptable. It's a lovely area (not picturesque like Montmartre or the Louvre, but Parisian all the same), it isn't heavy with foot traffic, and the metro is a straight shot to hubs like République or Nation. 

Areas that I would avoid: rue St. Denis near Chatelet, it's full of prostitutes and peep shows. Barbès-Rochechouart, unless you enjoy being harassed to buy cartons of cigarettes or boxes of cologne from annoying trench coat salesmen that hover around the metro station in swarms. Avoid staying near Champs-Elysées because it's insanely expensive, there is nothing to do for less than all the money in your wallet, and you'll have to swim through annoying tourists every day. I wouldn't stay all the way down in the 14th or 15th districts, either, because there's nothing to do and nothing to see.

**Edit**: don't worry about getting stabbed. Paris is a fairly safe city. Don't wander the streets using a smart phone at night, don't get totally drunk and wander into dark alleyways. Basic rules in any city. Staying in an area that others deem ""shady"" or ""seedy"" doesn't mean you're going to be stabbed. Sometimes ""shady"" or ""seedy"" just means that black people live there, and that's just good ol' charming Parisian racism.

3. In dem Alter beginnt man sich eine Meinung zu bilden und lässt dich dabei sehr von ihren Eltern/Lehrern/Betreuern beeinflussen, die dessen vielleicht noch nicht mal bewusst tun.

We've had a few that stood out over time, though:

There was 19-year old [Signe Friis](http://i2-images4.tv2net.dk/s/04/19670404-9bf72d7c6983a7df503d0a92186e895b.jpeg); the text translates to ""It's ONLY the politics that should be seen. See more on www.Signe-Friis.dk"" She got elected to city-council, with quite a handsome margin.

The rhyme translates to ""Holger *(chairman of SF)* and his wife says no to the union""; next year, they added [four exceptions to the Maastrict Treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Agreement_%281992%29), and both Holger and his wife said yes.

Unlike Basque nationalism, Catalan independentism/nationalism is pure Economic nationalism.

Ich denke, das wäre bei Wahlen genauso. Ich wünschte mir sogar, dass Kommunalwahlen ab 14 Jahren wären und Landtagswahlen ab 16.

Und je älter die Jugendlichen dann werden, desto mehr dürfen sie wählen gehen. Schritt für Schritt.

This is what I was talking about when I mentioned ""good ol' Parisian racism"". Not being able to see past a neighborhood's ethnic demographic.

I lived in both of these areas, I loved these areas, and I was never harassed by a single person while living there.  Whenever I told people that I lived at Chateau d'Eau or near Couronnes, everyone gave me a surprised look that said, ""but... BLACK/ARAB/[INSERT RACIAL MINORITY HERE] people live there!"" Places where I *was* harassed: Montmartre at Sacré-Coeur. Chatelet. Les Halles. Bastille. My friends were mugged at Saint Paul. Tourist-heavy areas. 

I'm surprised that /u/Luoluoluo is turned off by an area with Asian prostitutes, yet s/he lives at Clichy, which is famously known as the red light district where eroticism reigns after sundown.

Pigalles prostitutes are an ""official"" job and well hidden for the kid's eyes, classical peep-show. Bellevilles prostitutes are stuck in misery, working in the street. They try to survive by dealing 10€ fellation. A majority of them got a kids to feed. This is not ""neighborhood's ethnic demographic"", this is poverty you twat.

Why there's so much ""neighborhood's ethnic demographic"" ? Because my country fucked up with colonialism (and colonialisme is bad m'okaaaay) and when these population wanted a compensation for their duty ( WW1 / WW2 / National ressources rape everywhere colonialist were) government gave them a shithole to fill-in, cause they dont give a single fuck about them.

I wouldn't say that this is the case. U.S. can act the way it does because it is the most powerful state in the system. Russia, China, or anyone else, cannot act so blatantly outside of the international law unless they have the U.S. approval. So I don't think it's a threat that all of a sudden everyone will disregard the international law if the U.S. takes action in Syria. After all, similar things happened in Kosovo and Iraq, and, correct me if I'm wrong, we did not see much of a rise in violations of international law.

What Russia, and China, are trying to do is to constrain the actions of the U.S. through their UN veto powers. They cite international law, considerations of peace, etc. But in reality, it is their way of ensuring that the U.S. does not interfere in their interests.

So, a layman's estimate.

The ""winner"": ALDE. Centre Party has been doing well lately. They'll probably tie with the National Coalition (EPP), but the other party in ALDE from Finland, the Swedish People's Party, has very loyal voters. The other party in EPP, Christian Democrats, has been hurting and might drop out. (Unless they can run on a common list with other small parties and get lucky.)

True Finns (EFD) will be larger than SPD (S&amp;D) or Greens, but due to the granularity of the scale, I'd expect them to gain only one seat - especially if and when their chairman stays in the Finnish Eduskunta and does not run for the EP. So two seats for EFD, S&amp;D and Greens.

The rest probably won't be able to gain a seat. Unless they have a very popular candidate and run on a common list with another small party, in which case it'll probably come at the expense of the Greens or possibly the Swedes (ALDE).

Summary for Finland (personal expectations):

* ALDE 4
* EPP 3

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Walter Hallstein, a Nazi lawyer

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Hallstein#Early_life_and_pre-War_academic_career): *Hallstein was a member of several nominally Nazi professional organizations[i],[j][11] but, critically, he was not a member of the Nazi Party or the SA.[1] He is reputed to have rejected Nazi ideology[12][9] and kept his distance from the Nazis.[4]*

&gt; At the end of the war, Hallstein was captured by the Americans and sent to a prisoner camp in Mississipi. In 1948, he spent a year as visiting professor at the Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Hallstein#Soldier_and_prisoner_of_war_.281942.E2.80.931945.29) again: *In 1942 Hallstein was called up, and he served in an artillery regiment[9] in Northern France with the rank of first lieutenant (Oberleutnant).[10][k]. On 26 June 1944, during the Battle of Cherbourg, he was captured by the Americans[10] and sent to Camp Como, a prisoner-of-war camp in Mississippi.[14]*

As many veterans of the Bulge or the Battle of Berlin will tell you, the Battle of Cherbourg wasn't anywhere near ""the end of the war"". And Hallstein was a common PoW, a serving army officer captured in battle, much unlike those scientists flown to the US in Operation Paperclip.

&gt; Other recipients of the prize include Monnet, Schuman, Spaak, Kissinger, Clinton

And Vaclav Havel, Simone Veil, Gyula Horn, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands...what's your point there? You also forget to mention that Monnet, Schuman and Spaak were all three prominent figures of anti-Nazi resistance during WWII, definitely not the type to cooperate with a former Nazi. As for Evans-Pritchard's allegations against them, he's not an unimpeachable source [himself](http://ipezone.blogspot.fr/2009/08/ambrose-evans-pritchard-worst-financial.html).

true,cbfw86,UKGB,"Class clown, est. 1985","&gt; What I found interesting is the complete shift in tone the world has taken in terms of American aggression and fucking Russia being the voice of reason and peace

I find this unsettling rather than interesting. A month or so ago we had a public intellectual pan Russia on gay rights issues, and everyone was grabbing their pitchforks. Now everyone is siding with Putin and slamming Obama.

I won't lie, I enjoy seeing Obama face a real Presidential challenge that he can't fob off with a pretty speech, and I'm enjoying the backlash (the feeling of 'the harder they fall', etc.), but I'm unsettled by Russia's rise to the fore on this particular debate.

In my view, Russia and the US have been playing chess over Syria, and Putin is handing Obama's ass to him. There's no secret that the US want to destabilise the ME even more, and with 'the concern of a nuclear Iran' looming they will want to deal with as many of Iran's allies as possible. I'll accept that's highly debatable, but that's how I see it. (To be open, I oppose a nuclear Iran because it would mean a very localised not-so-Cold War between Israel and Iran (and her allies). I don't want to see that.) We also know that Russia has a key Naval Base in Syria, which they might lose if Syria becomes destabilised, and Russia no doubt understands that having local allies they can trade with will develop the region as a whole. So both countries have very heavily vested interests in the future of Syria.

This whole conflict has been pretty crucial to the strategic interests of both countries.

France's attitude was to use punitive strikes to pressure Assad to a table (in Geneva, according the general buzz in the media) where they could get him to sign up to the UN chemical weapons malarkey so as to ratify the 'red line' in international legislation. ([This article explains it better than me](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23895823).) That was the main argument coming from the UK Government as well.

Why is that important? Because Russia's invitation to Syria to give up it's chemical weapons and Syria's acceptance has basically called that meeting and found the solution the West was looking for. All in one go. No one else has died. No war was necessary. Putin has basically debagged the West and run off laughing. The diplomatic power of the West is now weakened, Putin looks like a beacon of human rights and diplomacy, and the now the Middle East has more reason to distrust Western powers. This whole thing is basically a nightmare.

It is so effective I am not sure if I believe the whole wasn't planned weeks in advance. Not the chemical attacks, but Russia knew what the West wanted but waited until Monday to make the announcement, giving ample time to let the Western press rip apart Obama's lack of evidence, effectively putting themselves in a position where they're ready to rally around the first political figurehead who will say what they want to be said. Then up steps Putin and steals the show. And now Putin - a shady-ass guy with a shady-ass history who likes to play musical chairs between the Russian Presidency and the Premiership - giving sermons in the New York Times on progressive, inclusive, big happy human family values? And everyone is lapping it up? This is the most significant geopolitical powerplay in recent years and Obama looks like a fucking shmuck.

The most effective propaganda is the stuff you don't immediately detect, and so far everyone's been using the word to describe Obama, not Putin. I still don't trust the guy, but I can't help but respect what Putin has achieved in recent days.",0,1378981113,null,0,false,0,cc6s9a8,t3_1m8isa,t1_cc6s9a8,t1_cc6ruxy,null,1429491227,22,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,22

true,Afirejar,GERM,Germany,"&gt; So the only way for Catalonia to exercise its right to self-determination is war? I might be naive, but isn't that quite sad in the 21st century?

Quite frankly, I'm bothered by that question. If you honestly thought that there is some sort of internationally recognized legal recourse for human rights violation, you need to get out and learn more about the world you live in, because ""the Western liberal democracy we live in isn't the Western liberal democracy we want to live in"" is exceedingly tame compared to other shit that's going on without anyone doing much about it.

&gt;Catalonia could declare independence unilaterally and then the UN would have to mediate, right?

The UN doesn't have to do shit. It could mediate if one of the members brought it up, but it's not like it has a mandate to involve itself without asking. More importantly, this is an internal Spanish matter and not an international matter. The Catalans want to be an independent state, but they in fact aren't an independent state, and for that reason alone almost all of international law doesn't apply. International law deals with matters between multiple states, and there's only one state here.

Also, look around in the world. The Catalans aren't unique. Chechnya, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, the list goes on. There were no international court decisions, no interventions. No one cares.

The law Russia passed (and it wasn't Putin that hates gays - there is deep seated homophobia culturally in Russia) are moderate in comparison. 

I think at the moment Russia has excelled at ""being on the lesser side of evil to the US"" purely because they are. 

They both have strategic interests in the ME - Europe will benefit greatly by the fall of Syria and placing a western puppet regime being put into place as we won't have to rely on russia anymore for energy, the US weaken an already dwindling Russia and another piece on the board turns colours to the stars and stripes. 

But the reason Russia is the voice of reason is because they're willing to keep the status quo to maintain a delecate balance of power. The west are willing to murder civilians and blow up a country to diminish Russia and Iran.

When Gotovina was freed Serbs started burning Croatian flags and protested that. From a Serbian point of view I get why. See Serbs think they got the short end of the stick and wonder why Gotovina is set free but Mladic and Karadzic have to remain in prison and face prosecution.

 A lot of Serbs cannot or will not understand that they did some horrible things during the Yugoslav wars and that the people in charge are getting punished for it. In my personal opinion the protesters would have never destroyed the signs if the Serbian people and leaders started to realize that they are to blame for the violent break-up of Yugoslavia where over 300 thousand people lost their lives.

I finally got a job offer (as a full-time employee doing IT support), and had to apply get my visa changed to allow nichtselbständiger Arbeit, which has been repeatedly denied. Look up ""Vorrangsprüfung"".
So, here you have someone who is fully integrated, speaks fluent German, and is currently not paying social or retirement taxes, looking for a visa that would permit him to work and pay taxes. You hear every day about the Fachkräftemangel and issues finding appropriately skilled workers. And the government says ""no, no visa for you"". I think what they're looking for is the piece of paper saying I've studied IT. Work experience appears to make little difference, at least for me.

At the end of my day, if they have any energy left I'll take them on my private tour of Montmartre. And then we'll go to the bars in Clichy.

It is unlikely you'll get stabbed but avoid the peripheral of the city. There isn't much out there for you anyway. Unless you are looking for a particular vice.

Montmartre is fine. Like everywhere in Paris the redlight districts blend in, until the night. Our friends' daughter's school is between 2 strip clubs; things like that. As like everywhere the pickpockets and cons go after overwhelmed tourist and it doesn't matter which neighborhood keep your money and phone in deep pockets, never leave it on the table.",0,1378986389,null,0,false,0,cc6szcw,t3_1m88cc,t1_cc6szcw,t3_1m88cc,null,1429490816,2,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,2

The trick is to close loopholes allowing companies to pay tax somewhere other than where they do their main business. It's not certain that this won't simply force them to actually do their main work in Ireland, though, which means the rest of the EU would lose out again.

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"I would say it is much more likely to happen now than it was some decades ago. I would say Catalonia is likely to make it first, as there is a bigger pression by the local population to make it (as seen yesterday).

The Basque project has slowed down (politically, socially it is still very active) a bit in the last couple of years (even though the pro-autonomy and pro-independence parties make a complete majority in the Basque Parliament), but should Catalonia be granted independence, the Basque Country will follow, I'm quite sure, because both movements have been very tied together since the end of the Francoist regime, and it is very unlikely that if one of them made it, the other one wouldn't actively fight for it too. 

**However**, nothing can be said with certainty because we lack of sufficient data. There is also the possibility (and I know it could be real) of us being here talking about seccesion and then getting a big ""No"" in the referendum. Anyway, should a possible referendum reflect the electoral results (at least in the Basque Country), the answer would very likely be yes, but we can't be sure. 

&gt;Navarre and the French Basque Country is going nowhere. 

Right now, no, they certainly aren't going anywhere. But please let's not forget that in northern Navarre (everything north of Pamplona, which we could consider the ""Basque Navarre"") the EH Bildu party (left-wing pro-independence and pro-Basque unification) is quite strong, and less so (but still) the Basque Nationalist Party. When I see the Basque independence, for now I only see the three provinces of the autonomous region making it, but somehow I feel/think that northern Navarre might follow in the no very distant future (maybe splitting Navarre in the Spanish Navarre, *Navarra*, and the Basque Navarre, *Nafarroa*, I don't know). About Iparralde (French Basque Country), well, the expectations should be set low. 

&gt;Also, how would independence affect traditional Catalan places like Valencia and the Balearic Islands? Could a Greater Catalonia ever happen?

Honestly, I don't think the possibilities of a Greater Catalonia (or Catalan Countries) are very high. If they are to include current Catalonia + Balearic Islands + Valencia + French Catalonia, then I guess they're as low as the possibilities for a Greater Basque Country. But, I wouldn't go as far as to say ""that would never happen"", we can't know. But if we talk about the non distant future, I believe there could be enough support in the Balearic Islands to join Catalonia, perhaps not in the beginning (just like northern Navarre in the Basque case), but maybe later. About Valencia... I truly don't think so. But maybe a Catalan or Valencian can give more info about this.

&gt;Also, what about other regions with independence movements, such as Galicia? Could Spain break up even more?

The Galician independentist movement is dying right now, and most of the supporters are autonomists (more autonomy inside Spain), but maybe it could regain some life if Catalonia and/or the Basque Country actually made it. I don't know much about it. Could Spain break up even more? Well, I don't think it is very likely, unless something very unexpected happens (like, complete economic ruin, and let's hope that doesn't get even close to happening).

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"Firstly, I must say that most Valencians and people in the Balearics would strongly object to their being described as ""traditional Catalan places"".

But that touches an important point. If there is a successful push for independence (and, with the proven inepcy of the current Spanish government, that may well happen), the main problem is that the eventual borders would be under dispute.

There are sympathisers of Catalan separatism in Valencia and the Balearics, but a majority of the population (a very large majority in Valencia) are hostile.

With respect to the Basque Country, the situation is even worse: not only is a large majority of the Navarrese very hostile to Basque separatism, but there are also similar sentiments (for similar historical reasons) in Alava, *within* the Basque Autonomous Region.

Personally, I think that secession of at least Catalonia is now possible, although I still give it less than even odds. It's frankly more unlikely in the Basque Country, never mind Galicia. What seems certain is that Spain (both the central government and the wannabe secessionists) now needs statesmen of great stature, and it's sadly lacking in that department.

Personally, it makes me sad that people strive for secession just when we would need more unity: we should be breaking old borders, not building new ones. And the fact that those new borders would immediately be under dispute also makes me fearful.

The article is quite interesting, but I'm afraid it's also pretty biased and fails to properly explain the view that some of us fake leftists (loved those quotes in your comment) have.

I've never disagreed with the fact that plenty of secessionists have leftist ideas and/or aspirations. Nobody does. What I've been trying to explain you is that the Catalonian left has put the flag before their ideals and by doing that, they're playing into the hands of the regional high bourgeoisie. Again, please compare the Mossos reaction to a 15M demonstration and their reaction to a nationalist one.

Notice as well how the article (while explaining some of these things) doesn't seem to address any of these points other than to comment how anyone who thinks this way is ""supposedly leftist"", not a sensible person (because those would obviously disagree with this view of the Catalonian nationalism), a Spanish nationalist and not a democrat.

I know it's completely pointless, but let me try again: I'm not a fascist, I'm not a right-winger in a leftist closet, I fully support the secession of Catalonia, the Basque Country, Galicia and any other Spanish region. Yet you're all puppets of the Catalonian elite and it saddens me that you refuse to see what's so clear for some of us.

Not at all. Unless people living there wants to also became independent. But even then, it will also depend on them if they want to associate/confederate with a future hypothetical Catalan Republic.

Yes. That's what happens when you don't built a country the right way and kill everyone who tries to fix it, or force them to exile.

- Current spanish law forbids unilateral proclamations of independence. If the independentists can convince most of the spanish population to change the constitution... that's hardly going to happen, and I don't think they're even trying to do that.

- There's the possibility that, if the economy keeps on going worse, the central government could not have enough resources to enforce its legality in all of Spain and the bigger social unrest could make people seek for alternatives (creating de facto new states? rebellion against the government but staying inside Spain?). I still see this highly unlikely, but who knows...

- I think foreign governments haven't showed support (yet) for any of the independentist movements (explicit or otherwise), which is the most important step for creating a new state.

- It's much more likely for Spain to become a federal state (a la Germany) in the coming years, which I think it's the best spot we can strive for, right now (also, fuck the king!).

Basque Country is the easy one. Thanks to their special fiscal status with regards to the central government, the economical crisis hasn't touched the Basque Country that badly, giving them an even more comfortable position inside Spain. They are still proudly nationalistic, but the ""disappearance"" of ETA and the return of Bildu (the leftist nationalist party) back to the town halls and regional governments has served to mellow the separatist movement out. Nobody expects a Basque secession. 

And now I realise /u/metroxed has pretty much said the same thing from a Basque nationalist perspective. Check his comment, yo!

Now, Catalonia. I'm going to say something terrible but it's the goddamn truth: public demonstrations mean nothing, so does our votes. That's something we Spaniards have learned the hard way in the past 5 years. We don't live in a democracy down here. Sucks, I know. The majority of Catalonians (or at least a very vocal half of them) want independence from Spain, currently the majority of the Catalonian parlament is composed by parties in favour of a independence referendum. If we were only to take these facts into account it's not hard to understand why for many people the Catalonian secession is just a matter of time.

Now I explain you why it won't happen: Catalonia is [the most indebted region of Spain](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/03/15/spain-public-debt-hits-84-percent-annual-gdp-catalonia-most-indebted-region/). Spanish regions can only sell debt to the Bank of Spain, therefore [the central government has been buying Catalonian debt for the past years at an interest](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19395266).

Catalonia has no power to negotiate their secession with the Spanish government since their are indebted to Madrid, and if they were to bypass the Spanish state and appeal to Europe to achieve their independence, all Spain would need to do is explain that they would be unable to repay their national debt to the German banks if Catalonia were to become its own country.

""Le 29 septembre 1988, un garagiste circulant sur l'autoroute Paris-Lille vit une énorme boule rouge traverser la chaussée à quelques dizaines de mètres de lui et rouler en contrebas. Lançant des reflets lumineux et enveloppée d'une fumée dense, la boule finit par s'arrêter dans un champ. Troublé par cette observation, le garagiste alla en rendre compte aux gendarmes de l'autoroute. La gendarmerie, sur ordre du préfet, neutralisa alors l'autoroute et une zone de plusieurs kilomètres autour de l'objet. Le témoin principal et sa famille furent conduits par précaution à l'hôpital où ils subirent une série d'examens. Des agents de la Sécurité civile et de la Sécurité militaire se rendirent sur le lieu de l'incident munis de compteurs Geiger. En effet, on attendait à cette période la chute du satellite soviétique Cosmos 1900, équipé d'un générateur électronucléaire, et des consignes précises avaient été données. Le CNES précisa assez rapidement qu'à la même heure Cosmos 1900 survolait l'océan Indien. Avançant avec précaution, les spécialistes de la sécurité s'approchèrent d'une sphère de 1,50 m de diamètre environ. Ils constatèrent qu'elle ne portait aucune trace des échauffements et des effets mécaniques considérables que produit une rentrée atmosphérique et qu'elle était recouverte de petits miroirs. On ne décela près d'elle ni fumée, ni radioactivité. On apprendra plus tard que cette sphère, destinée à servir d'accessoire à un concert de Jean-Michel Jarre, était tombée du camion qui l'emportait à Londres. Les petits miroirs collés sur son enveloppe en polystyrène étaient destinés à réfléchir les effets lumineux du spectacle.""",0,1378992675,null,0,1378992895,0,cc6uae3,t3_1m75zc,t1_cc6uae3,t3_1m75zc,null,1429490206,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

What's more when polled, people that express an opinion and when aware of what EFTA is are overwhelmingly in favour of it.  It's only the counter surface argument which is very quick to get around and very easy to understand.

The contributions the likes of Norway or Switzerland pay, as a scaled factor of GDP or GDP per person is much lower than the UK contribution.  The rebate argument is nonsense (and much of it has already been surrendered or timeframes agreed, and it shrinks every time a new member joins).   The UK would contribute a fraction of what it does now and as a net contributor it can easily pick and choose which EU projects in the UK it thinks worthy of continuation and still make significant savings.

They would have to abide with around 30% of regulations but they would have a veto which they do not have now, far greater scope to interpret these regulations, a UK judge in the EFTA court familiar with common law if any of these regulations are contested which is not the case with the ECJ, and contrary to popular belief Norway does have a consultation phase framing regulations arguably at the most influential stage.

It's not even seen as a biggy.  People understand that when you trade with the US you meet US regulations.  When you trade with China you meet Chinese regulations, and so on.  So they get that they'll be geared to working with EU regulations too.  They also get that they would be able to negotiate their own trade deals and drop EU tariffs that the EU has against ~150 countries.

What people do understand all too well is that the UK has terrible influence in the Parliament already.  They get that the UK outlook is atypical of the average EU perspective.  Of our top three European parties only one (Labour) is in a major EU voting bloc and they (New Labour) don't have a good record on Europe.  People know that they betrayed them.

Firstly, the rates are not the biggest problem, but how the taxes are applied. In the current situation, those countries that have been mentioned have opened loopholes that help large multinational companies avoid paying *any* taxes *anywhere*.

Secondly, the problem being adressed here by the Commission is an Irish policy of negotiating individual rates of taxation with large companies. This is an anticompetitive monstruosity, not only against the rest of Europe, but also against small Irish businesses: why would a small independent coffee shop in Ireland have to pay tax at several times the rate that has been negotiated for Starbucks?

This also comes to show that your ""sovereignity defence"" is a sham: these discriminatory tax policies are the blatant result of regulatory capture or even outright corruption, and are certainly not the result of an open democratic debate in Ireland or elsewhere.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt;It wasn't really hanging on the sidelines, it was pushing further into Europe, violently at a lot of times. 

In case you didn't notice, I'm a Finn. The local history is basically the list of Russian and Swedish border skirmishes. Never the less, Russia-the-culture was never really spread inside the borders of the Russian Empire before the caucus report around 1900, where it became apparent that Russians were actually minority in their own empire (which led to Russification through the realm and hastened the fall of the Romanov line). 

&gt;Europeanisation occurred heavily through the 1600s and 1700s with highlights being: introducing the Julian calendar, changing the alphabet, recruited top scientists and foreign workers, and of course, built Russia's new capital (St. Petersburg) deliberately close to (and modelled on) the Europe of the time. 

This was bringing Europe into Russia (which was rather unpopular move for Peter), but it wasn't about being involved with Europe -- that is, bringing Russian ideas to European culture of that time (whatever that would have meant).

&gt;Additionally, territory acquired in modern day Estonia, Latvia, and Finland, brought Russia closer to the trade routes of central and Western Europe.

Wasn't this characterised as ""sleeping bear awakening""? Anyway, this was all relatively recent, from 18th century forward and AFAIK it was seen in the traditional area of Europe ""diminishing"", not Russia entering it as a new player... but I might be wrong on this one. 

Meanwhile, arabs, and later the Ottoman Empire had pretty aggressively taken ideas from the continent, given it its own mix and then bringing it back. The fact that we even know about Greek classics today is largely because the arabs had saved them! So in that case, the relationship was clearly give-and-take and started almost immediately after West Rome fell. 

&gt;After this, Russia was intricately linked with European affairs, far from shying away. Russia was a major player in the two world wars and the Napoleonic wars, as well as being the harbinger of communism (which took over half of Europe and created a divide to this day).

True, but then, so was USA ;)

&gt;Russia is sometimes described as the being the 'Third Rome', after Ivan III married his way into the Byzantine royals, and highlighted his country's faith to the Byzantine religion of Orthodoxy.

And this preserving of the true faith was a large reason why the interaction with the heretical Catholic/Protestant faiths of Europe were so few. It was believed there was very little to learn from the unfaithful; due to which Peter's actions were so trastic.

The tax avoidance is not as a result of our tax code but as a result of using multiple tax codes of different countries together. Tax avoidance is not illegal just something to be annoyed about. So why don't the countries who are upset about it make it illegal so that it's tax evasion?

I suspect because that's not really what they're upset about, they're more upset that we're getting investment they aren't and are trying to make us raise our tax rate like they have been for years.

Good point haha. An argument could be made that the US is ethnically and culturally European, but a world away!

The Lithuanians were reluctant to join it, but did when offered Polish coat of arms (that meant their rights become equal to those of Polish nobility, szlachta). The Lithuanians kept their separate treasury and every institution and office was duplicated into Crown and Lithuanian types. I'm not familiar with any resentment directed at the Commonwealth from this period. 

What you need to know is that this enormous shape of Lithuania in middle ages does not reflect ethnic boundaries. A lot of Ruthenian principalities and cities were annexed into it out of fear of the Mongols (or what's left of them). The elites also were gradually polonized and ruthenized which meant that only a territory of about today Lithuania remained traditionally Lithuanian, as in, the people who actually started this whole country. 

That being said, the 'proper' Lithuanians had a national awakening in the 18-19th century and felt that under Commonwealth their culture was being eradicated. So some of them might not like it. Also, some of Belarussians feel that they are the only/main succesors of the Commonwealth (which is interesting if you compare PLC, Poland and Belarussian flag from between USSR and Lukashenka...), and not todays Lithuanians, as their culture wasn't that prominent back in the day.

So exploitatnion? Probably not. Identity shift? Sure (maybe more than once...).

""Ethnic"" Lithuanians weren't the biggest population group in Lithuania then anyway - Ruthenians were. Some even say Belarus has as much right to call itself Lithuania as Lithuania - most of the terrain of pre-1918 Lithuania is now in Belarus, and the culture was mix of Polish-Jewish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian cultures back then anyway.

During partitions Poles and Lithuanians had common interests - independence from Russia. And elites still considered themselves ""Polish"" as well as ""Lithuanian"" (for example Mickiewicz fought for restoration of Commonwealth, but called Lithuania his motherland, Józef Piłsudski was also Lithuanian, and he basically created inter-war Poland from scratch).

Modern nationalism was created in 19 century, and when Poland and Lithuania regained independence after WW1 Poles were surprised to find out that Lithuanians want their own country. Not all of course, but most of them. Poland attacked and conquered Vilnius. Now they doesn't like us.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Tax revenue per GDP is irrelevant. Says little about taxes and more about the effectiveness of your tax collection mechanism (which as we know is problematic, to put it extremely mildly).

Your whole point is that Greece was overtaxed and if it was not then the crisis would have been milder. To gauge that you need to look at the actual taxes paid, not the taxes requested by the state. It's the outcome that matters, not the claim. If the bureaucracy is ineffective and these people and corporation did not have to pay their taxes in full, that can only mean that the money was left for them to do as they please, which is what you wanted in the first place. 

&gt; So you are saying these (arguably middle-class and/or upper middle class) guys are taxed more than anywhere (bar Belgium) so the implication is that working class people and lower middle class should pay more taxes? 

No, the implication is that from this graph alone we can draw no conclusion about the taxation rate for the whole population because it's only a slice of the data. 

&gt; Moreover, in order to undermine the utility of the chart, you seem to make the case that -unlike other countries shown in that chart- we tax the haves more than other countries and thus the chart is not indicative for taxation of the lower economic strata. In other words, yes we have high taxes but only for those in the middle class and above; a rather very progressive tax system.

I'm not saying we tax ""the haves"", I'm saying we tax a very small group that does not really coincide with the rich. The chart you showed me only counts wage as an income. Rich people aren't paid money only from wages. A progressive tax system forces the rich to pay, not the pretty insignificant social class of high-earning wage labourers. 

&gt; What I don't agree with is that those that pay the 100% of what they're supposed to pay in taxes (either willingly or because simply they cannot evade due to the nature of their incomes) should be taxed more.

I did not say that. 

&gt; By your standard all preceding govts have 'laid off' hundreds of thousands of public workers in the course of the last decades (and unfortunately replaced them with new ones).

The point is that the last round of letting them go, they were not replaced at all. Is that not an effective reduction of the public servant numbers? 

&gt; I'm assumming we'll have to agree that we disagree on this too since -no matter what a set of 6 or 56 indicators may say- no two countries are exactly comparable so as to arrive at what you called 'scientific' conclusions.

Yes, it's a huge problem. I could pick a country too that did X policy that I like and then had some good thing Y happen to them and try to attribute Y to be a consequence of X. But I try not to.

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"&gt;With respect to the Basque Country, the situation is even worse: not only is a large majority of the Navarrese very hostile to Basque separatism, but there are also similar sentiments (for similar historical reasons) in Alava, within the Basque Autonomous Region.

I don't think this part is entirely accurate because it disregards certain aspects vital to understand the situation both in Navarre and Euskadi. Let's go by parts:

**Navarre** does not make a single, homogeneous social entity, unlike some other regions from northern Spain. Yes, they all feel Navarrese (to the core, just ask someone from Pamplona!), but there's an important division (not in the ""bad"" sense of division, but meaning more something like a ""difference"") between the northern and southern halves, something that dates from the times of the old Kingdom of Navarre. The Kingdom of Navarre put together two different ethnics; the Basque-speaking people at north and the Navarro-Argonese speaking at south. This last ones, were eventually absorbed by Castilians and Aragonese, as the Navarro-Aragonese language disapparead. This ""difference"" still stands today. If you have ever been in Navarre, you can tell; everything is different once you go north or south of Pamplona, everything. What's the point of all this? That of course the southern Navarrese oppose the Basque integration, it's only logical and I, for one, support their refusal to be part of something they feel (and with every right) don't belong to. However, the northern Navarrese **do** feel Basque, they speak Basque and share and live the Basque culture. I think that if the northerners feel like they want to become part of an hypothetical independent Basque Country, they should be allowed to.

About, **Álava**. Yes, if we had to make a ranking about the most and the least nationalist Basque provinces, Álava would probably be the least. But saying that they might even be ""hostile"" to the Basque nationalism or separatism, is not correct. Let's please not forget that in the last regional elections, the Basque Nationalist Party and EH Bildu got the majority of votes in Álava too. 

Don't forget either that the least nationalist or pro-independence regions of the Basque Country (city of Vitoria, Santurtzi, Sestao, etc.) are also the ones that received the most Spanish immigration in the 20th century, so that's something to keep in mind.",0,1378995534,null,0,false,0,cc6v1s3,t3_1m8ngv,t1_cc6v1s3,t1_cc6tiii,null,1429489851,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Just paying attention to your surroundings will make or break your experience no matter where you stay in the city. Also keep in mind that the 19th is the one of the largest if not the largest arrondissement of Paris and the most diverse. There are many different pockets of cultural communities, like Arab, Chinese, Jewish, and super yuppies.  

Sometimes people are struck by the lack of [Haussmann buildings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haussmann's_renovation_of_Paris) around the metro entrances in these arrondissements (because they were developed after the Haussmann era) and assume that they are neglected or unwelcoming parts of the city (not ""true"" Paris as it were). Rest assured that very few people who live or work in these arrondissements agree with this judgement. For me, there is 100x more charm and personality in the 18th or 19th or 20th than in the 5th, 6th or 7th, for example. But in the end, the city is so small that even a short trip doesn't have to be spent excluding any of these places -- so you feel free to move around and judge for yourself.

Widespread Polish language was not considered as a problem for Lithuania at the time. On the other hand, according to some evaluations, Polish dominance was not beneficial for development of a separate future Lithuania.

Poland-Lithuania eventually came to an end in 1795, when it was divided between Russian, Austrian and Prussian empires. In both countries there were significant national movements in the late 19th and early 20th century. Both Lithuania and Poland managed to become independent in 1918, that being a consequence of WW1. Idea of unification was simply out of question, as these were times of national states being born all over Europe. Spirit of national self-identification was in the air.

Relations between Poland and Lithuania became extremely hostile, as everyone was butthurt over language, culture, identity, and most importantly over who should rule city of Vilnius. Shitty stuff ensued, mutinies and occupations included. Then WW2 came and you know how it all ended. Only around 1988 we finally got a chance to put our relations back into order.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt; I did notice, for the record the Finnish wikipedia agrees with me about Russia in Europe

The picture is the same they have in every language-edition, I think. The text itself gives several separate definitions, all based on suspiciously convenient interpration of geography and not shared culture (which was my argument). The articles on Russia and Russian culture on wikipedia seem to highlight the differences to European norm. 

All this is irrelevant, of course, as wikipedia is not an authority! :)


&gt;Also, 'Russification' wasn't exclusive to the 1900s onwards, a crucial part of colonisation has always been to assimilate at least a part of the native population, even now there is hybridity in places like Belarus and Ukraine.

I think that in Russian mentality those areas were always Russian and they were just strengthening the local culture. Compare Russian administration of Siberia which relied upon local powers who simply swore to pay tithe and how Finnish and Polish nations were ran as autonomic entities under the Empire (at least before census reports). Baltic states didn't see much immigration before the census either, but I may be mistaken on that one.

&gt;Also, you said that Europe is a different culture from Russia, but when I mentioned the Europeanisation of Russia you say it doesn't count because the rest of Europe wasn't Russified??

I meant that it's a two-way street. For example, UK and Sweden (both ""island cultures"") imported ideas from the continent, developed them and then exported back. Students from all over Europe came to UK and Sweden and then returned; and students from UK and Sweden left their homelands to study and returned. There was a continual change of ideas and concepts. Meanwhile, Russia just imported ideas as one crash course. We could as well compare Peter's Europeanisation to Japan's Meiji Restoration, where the country imported European models by barrelful. But we didn't really see kimonos becoming fashionable in Europe, or philosophy texts or a lot of foreign students studying at Tokyo. 

As such, Russia might be located on the European ""continent"" (an idea which is mostly based on cultural concept and not tectonic plates), but it's not really part of the European ""cultural sphere"". After all, we don't define ""North America"" as involving Mexico (even as it does, with much better merits).

&gt;Is this taught in Finland? I'm just curious, as it's not in W. Europe.

Not in so many words, but the idea can be readily seen in Swedish texts of the time and later in those continental maps where Russia is drawn as a bear or octopus or something similar attacking humanised now-EU countries. But this is largely just my interpretation. I haven't seen a study of this to either way, though should probably look actively. If one can't be found, might be worth trying to write it myself.

&gt;Do you think this may have been two-way? Western Europe always saw Russia as a 'mystical' country because of its distance.

I'm fairly sure I've read that the political elite of Russia intentionally limited contact to now-EU (for lack of better term) for religious and nationalistic reasons.

EDIT: Also worth noting that Russia has a lot of waterways that make it relatively near even from Britain. You could basically sail from London to the site of St. Petersburg and swap to riverboat and continue all the way to Moscow.

That's a possiblity. But we cannot know until we have a region-wide referendum, even if it's only consultative and non-vinculant. 

&gt;Furthermore, Alava also has a problem within a problem, namely Treviño County. While it seems certain that a majority in that small enclave would like to join Alava within the Basque Autonomous Region, it seems also certain that an even bigger majority would never want to join an independent Basque Country...

Treviño County has been asking for annexation to Álava for a while now; both of the municipalities that comprise the county seem to be in favour. You say it seems certain they (I'm guessing the people from Treviño) would never want to join an independent Basque Country. I wouldn't say something in such a categorical fashion.

[Empanadas from Galicia](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-52kEVTvZg-8/TtzTyzQ1_aI/AAAAAAAAAfE/QbHExGQpHlI/s640/IMG_6202.jpg) - pasties stuffed with tuna or chorizo and an onion, garlic and tomato sauce.

**FOR MAINS:**

[Tolosa bean stew from Guipuzkoa](http://www.gastronomiaycia.com/wp-content/photos/alubias_tolosa_butifarra.jpg) - a bean stew made from the famed black beans of Tolosa, along with lots of morcilla (blood sausage), chorizo, onion and garlic.

[Pil-pil cod from Vizcaya](http://imagenes-recetas.cocina.es/original/bacalao-al-pil-pil.jpg) - just the best thing done with salt cod ever, even if we morally ought not eat it! Cod, slow cooked in olive oil, garlic and dried chilli peppers until it starts to dissolve into a sauce, then served.

(Begrudgingly) [Paella from Valencia](http://granjaescuelalailusion.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/paella-valenciana.jpg) because it's the thing everyone has heard of. That said, a true Valencian paella made with chicken, rabbit and snails is absolutely delicious.

**FOR DESSERT:**

[Crema catalana from Catalunia](http://www.laylita.com/recipes/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/crema-catalana-3.jpg) - Imagine a creme brulée but the custart is flavoured with orange zest and cinammon.

**AND TO DRINK:**

[Cider from Guipuzkoa](http://www.euskonews.com/0282zbk/argazkiak/gaia28205_05.jpg) - traditionally poured from about 1-2m into your glass, sometimes directly from the cask.
