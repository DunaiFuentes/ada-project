These are very agreeable positions to take. However, he ties the two points together by stating:

* Without privacy, there can be no freedom of expression or opinion

And I'm not sure if I completely follow that line of thinking. Will the lack of privacy on the internet make people any less outspoken than they were before the existence of the internet in the first place? And if governments are not acting on any opinions or expressions unless they are pertaining to wildly illegal acts, is the freedom of expression truly limited?

Che se necessario puó anche smettere di  esistere. *No, non sto scherzando, la penso davvero cosí.* NON possono esistere i ""favori"", se c'é il rischio di fare favori il rischio va eliminato.

Personalmente il concetto principale é che non dovrebbe esistere il concetto di ""faccio il favore ad un amico"" ma il concetto di ""ricevo una richiesta e la evado secondo le regole"".

Poi bho, io sono quello che non sorpassa se c'é la striscia continua anche se non arriva nessuno nella direzione opposta. E sono quello che se viene fermato dall'amico carabiniere dice ""buongiorno"" e non ""ciao"" (oppure, come ho detto tempo fa: ""se doventassi vigile urbano sarei moralmente costretto a multare l'auto di mia moglie"").",0,1383500104,null,0,false,0,cd5tzz6,t3_1pr0t4,t1_cd5tzz6,t1_cd554dd,null,1428876524,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Usually these people are already on watchlists. I would argue its not necessary to collect everyone's information. The 9/11 hijackers were on German and FBI watchlists, the Boston bombers were brought to the attention of the US by Russia.

Also, the UK is fairly well known as being the center for radicalization in Europe, specifically their universities. The Stockholm [bomber was radicalized there](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/8198043/Sweden-suicide-bomber-Taimur-Abdulwahab-al-Abdaly-was-living-in-Britain.html). At least in the early 2000s US, German, and French intelligence would refer to London as [Londonistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Londonistan_(term) for their acceptance of Islamist groups setting up shop there, as long as they didn't attack within the UK.

Even knowing all of this I would still argue it is not necessary for mass surveillance. It is fairly well known where problems exist. Conventional intelligence gathering has worked in the past, it was just not followed up with properly in cases like the 9/11 hijackers.

She didn't took it personal either because she has simply never learned, that this question can be very rude.

I think one reason for that is that we love to label things, part of the German obsession about order and efficiency. Usually we don't mean it bad, but since every label carries the risk of becoming a stigma, we should really rethink our attitude towards the globalized world we live in.

We have no borders in Europe and it is completely normal to be able to just drive down from Holland to Portugal.

Today France and Germany have common military units, common TV channels, a common currency and there is no sense of rivalry or hatred between them.

I think we've come a pretty long way. It's easy to imagine a Europe where there is no war but still extensive animosity. 

I mentioned France and Germany because those two countries are the key to understanding the whole thing. The tragedies of the 20th century were seen as common European tragedies after World War 2. A common fate that one must escape from. Britain of course wasn't defeated and hadn't been defeated. Britain was also not in that spiral of hatred between France and Germany that fuelled so much of what had happened.

This plus the geographical separation that shaped politics and culture over the centuries is probably why the UK is so ""euroskeptic"". For mainland Europe and the founding members of the EU (ECSC) the project was one of peace, cooperation and revolutionary reconciliation. For Britain it was an emerging trading bloc that should be joined for economic interest.

Also, use real numbers not tabloid style ones, since 80% of nothing is still nothing. So to help, the current cap is about 60 billion euro (with enviromental expenditure), the EU 2013 budget about 150 billion euro. The greek budget for example is 106 billion euro, finland's budget is 109 billion euro, the spanish one is 493 billion, and france is 1.15 trillion (2012 numbers). There, perspective.

Also to respond to the other message you posted. Yes, the CAP needs more reform, and it's constantly getting it. Personally i believe forestry is marginalized right now while luxury goods are given too high priority. But that discussion is different than saying we must scrap the CAP, it serves its purpose, and we can afford to buy a bit of resource security.

Petty rules! Are you saying that not wanting to give up sovereignity is *petty ruling*? 

Do you think *following and respecting treaties* is **petty ruling**. 

If that is *petty ruling*, why should we have any treaties? Shouldn't just Brussels tax us all? Or, shall we foollow any rules - at all. You apparently think it is  unimportant to follow treaties. 

Please, explain to me how you are going to build anything worthwhile while not even attempting to respect the law and treaties? Do you want anarchy or dictatorship - because what you ar suggesting is so much against democracy that it is not even funny.!

&gt;So democracy should not be proposed until there is a treaty change to get rid of the king/whatever, womans suffrage should not be proposed until they are given the right to vote and unions should not be proposed until they are made legal. Petty rules lawyering does not help anyone.

What? 44 % of the budget, don't you get that. And, are you defending the CAP in its current form. Good, I'll take you on. Whty do you support tobacco and wine subsidies? Why do you discriminate Swedes and Finns? Why have you refused, for decades to become more competitive. I would like answers, in detail please. 

&gt;Also to respond to the other message you posted. Yes, the CAP needs more reform, and it's constantly getting it. Personally i believe forestry is marginalized right now while luxury goods are given too high priority. But that discussion is different than saying we must scrap the CAP, it serves its purpose, and we can afford to buy a bit of resource security.

*I never said scrap it*. Where did I say that? I said the CAP in its current form is idiotic, plus that you want to use it, against the treaties, against democracy.

It is scary how little you respect democracy and treaties. Do you even care, remotely. If you want the rest of the EU to sponsor welfare in another country, we are talking about the end of the national state, and a federation on a whole different level. How can you refuse people to vote about that? How can you support that without going through the proper channels?

Devo dire però che essendo un ragazzo un po buffo e molto aperto, ho sentito abbastanza freddezza dalla gente. I finlandesi sono molto intelligenti, e certe volte sentivo un aria come se mi prendevano in giro o pensavano che ero stupido. Non ho detto niente perche non mi andava di litigare con la gente, ma comunque... Io volevo solo fare amici quando uscivo visto che visitavo la citta da solo e non conoscevo nessuno. Forse se avevo un amico con me la gente avrebbe trovato meno ""strano"" il fatto che mi piaceva chiacchierare con le persone che incontravo..... 

Penso che il fatto che ho un aspetto piu ""nordico"" che ""italiano"" cambiava un po le aspettative della gente. Forse non credevano nemmeno che ero Italiano....

true,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,"&gt; What do you expect coming from a guy that thinkg that immigrants that come to Europe have money, houses, benefits thrown at them, and most don't even bother to get a job.[1] 

Pardon me for questioning immigration policies. I just want Norway to remain a prosperous country well into the future.[ Each immigrant that come to Norway costs our society 4,1 million NOK](http://www.hegnar.no/okonomi/article725638.ece). Yes, immigrants gets housing for free when they come here. Money aswell. I think it is the right thing to do to avoid people ending up homeless. What i am worried about though is if the welfare benifits are to generous and makes immigrants not motivated to work.

[Take a look at these numbers](http://www.ssb.no/innvregsys/). Employment among the Norwegian population is around 70%. The same numbers from immigrants from Africa is 42,5% and 54,6% for Asian immigrants. The numbers for women are much lower. How can the welfare state remain sustainable if noone works to finance it?

I am far from the only one who say this. Many succesful immigrants say the same.

&gt; this marvel of a comment[2] where he says that 'Gypsies' are Norway's biggest problem, which even for those gypsy haters amongst you is a big of a stretch.

Norway's biggest problem may be a strech. The sustainability of our welfare state is the biggest problem, but that is another debate. The gypsy debate was very big in Norway the last two summers. We want to help them, but they don't want to cooperate. You can't just drive (yes, they drive cars) into a country with a tourist visa and demand to get a job and housing. Actually you aren't even allowed to enter Norway if you don't have the necessary funds to stay here. 

We have actually tried to help them some years ago. We gave them housing. Guess what happened, the entire place was ruined and everything was stolen. How can you possibly work with someone like that?

&gt; Fortunately, he's only 18 so maybe he'll grow out of his racist garbage.

And there was the racist card thrown out. Ill just leave this here from a earlier argument:

""I find it hard to have a factual argument with you when you just throw out the word racist for no reason. Honestly i have lot of very nice immigrant friends, and they hate immigrants who do stupid shit aswell. Just as i hate when some of my white friends do stupid things.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"You think that the problem with immigrant employment is because they don't want to find jobs? When people with [non scandinavian names apply for jobs](http://www.thelocal.se/20130405/47164) in Scandinavia, they are far more likely to get turned down than locals. This is a study done in Sweden, yes, but I'm more familiar with the case there and I'm pretty sure you can generalize the results to Norway as well. The problem isn't that immigrants 'don't want to find jobs', it's that the process for them to get jobs is a great deal more arduous and fraught with xenophobia. In a traditionally homogeneous society like Norway's this is understandable, though not condonable. Norway accepted these people into their country, made them citizens, guaranteed them a way of life there, but because Norwegian society is still closed to outsiders this life is increasingly difficult to live in, especially when you're a single immigrant or a small family that has no social networks to depend upon arrival in Norway. 

My mother was an immigrant to Australia. She was a highly educated doctor (head of a department at a hospital), but didn't speak any English upon arrival. If it weren't for her blue collar neighbours, Aussies whose families had been living there for at least three generations, inviting her over to events with them often, despite her absolutely atrocious english, teaching her the morals and values of Australian society, she would've probably ended up just hanging out with people who were from her country. These days, she sounds more Australian than I do and she loves the country and society. 

I think the problem with immigration in Scandinavia doesn't tend to be the immigrants. It's the closed off Scandinavian societies where, if you live in a big city where most immigrants go, don't speak to their neighbours, don't know their names, and assume that 'society' or 'the government' will integrate immigrants, as if it happens by osmosis. Your government, the people your society elected to run the country and represent them, chose to let immigrants in. You, as a society, now have a collective responsibility for the good of your own society to make their transition into mainstream Norwegian life as painless as possible. Just looking at it pragmatically, if you don't want a permanent ghettoized underclass of darker citizens living in your country for generations, Norwegians have to stop hiding behind their government and politicians and try to form some kind of mutual understanding themselves. After all, how many people do you know that befriended a 'fresh off the boat' immigrant and tried to introduce them to the ways of your society? How else are they going to learn?

But maybe it's too late. Maybe, thanks to more then a decade now of 'immigrants just don't integrate', xenophobia, populist politicians complaining about immigration and newspaper articles portraying immigrants as criminals, that all directly prey on and impact those darker skinned people that you have living in Norway, has made them feel like such outsiders and helped cement a culture of them being resentful to mainstream Norwegian culture, where older brother/sisters tell younger ones not to bother to get a job, or not to bother doing well at school - because the native born Norwegians are against you anyway and wouldn't want to give you a job either, that native Norwegians just don't want you there. After all, that's what they read in the paper, hear from their politicians, and see from untrusting eyes on the street.

This is why I'm not a fan of populist politicians and their xenophobic platforms, like SverigeDemokraterna, Dansk Folkeparti, or Fremskrittspartiet. Every time they rail against immigrants and immigration policy, what they're really doing is sending a big fuck you to all the people that emigrated to Norway and strengthening the differences between native and immigrant born Norwegians. No Western country likes to think of itself as racist, or having any of the values traditionally associated with those. But just as Australia has to admit it has a huge problem with how the public treats Indigenous Australians and try and come up with a way to reconcile the past and present, so too do Scandinavians need to realise that the way their society functions isn't fantastically conducive to immigrants, and the 'simple' options - 'exterminate the aborigines', or 'deport all the immigrants'

As for the 'gypsies', yes, there are criminal gangs that run around, commit crime, and try and abuse the fuck out of the system which comprise of 'gypsies'. But do you say 'fucking French' when you hear of a French person committing a crime in Norway, or try and abuse the Norwegian system, or do you put it down to just that individual?

That's a very interesting graph in the sense that there should be parity between Swedish and Norwegian prices, as they are part of the same electricity grid.

I'm not so concerned about governments spying on other governments, primarily because governments are powerful enough to protect themselves.  Secondarily, governments have spied on each other since ancient times, often for the purpose of verifying the truth of official statements issued by targeted governments.  Being traditional doesn't make it right, but the tradition is so well-established that governments are certainly forewarned and should take appropriate precautions, like not discussing important business on a cell phone.

Large-scale surveillance of people who are not suspected criminals is what bothers me.  Ordinary people have almost no defense against it, and in the hands of the wrong type of politician, it could be used for oppressive purposes.

Perhaps I was trying to show that ""quit if you're going to get kids"" isn't exactly the best solution to the problem.

&gt;We're talking about politicians here.

I thought so too, but as my point was that politicians should make the road for the rest of us, you were very much saying that this wasn't something that anybody should do.

&gt;Firstly, a child has two parents. Secondly, this isn't about having kids in general, it's about bringing them to work in order to care for them.

Firstly, not all kids have two parents. Those that do don't necessarily have two parents that are interested or able to take part in raising kids.

Second, I'd say that this is about how women should be able to fit working life and child-rising together. You obviously have a very traditional solution; I'd rather think that society should accommodate women with young kids better. 

&gt;How many companies in Europe find it acceptable to bring your child to work in order to care for it?

I thought we were talking about how the views might change in the future. That things are in certain way now doesn't mean they are so in the future; after all, it's a question of legistlation. Bringing that kid to the parliament was a pretty obvious way to show that things could be like this in general. 

&gt;You've just predicted a world ending scenario if women and men can't change their children's diapers at work. Maybe you're being just a little bit irrational?

Not a world-ending situation, but the truth is that if a woman has to decide between children and career, she may not always choose children. This might be great as far as world population goes, but not that good as far as developed country goes.

&gt;You're severely misinformed and I'd advise you not to speak on subjects [Japan] you know nothing about. It makes you look quite silly.

*""Tomita says a woman's chances of promotion in Japan stop dead as soon as she marries. ""The bosses assume you will get pregnant."" Once a woman does have a child, she adds, the long, inflexible hours become unmanageable. ""You have to resign. You end up being a housewife with no independent income. It's not an option for women like me.""* [Source](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex)

&gt;I'm not sure if you've ever had to take care of kids, or if you ever worked, but let me make it very clear: you cannot do both. Work and family life do not mix outside of some very specific professions.

I have taken care of kids and I have worked in an environment (office) where people brought their kids in if for one reason or another and they couldn't take them for kindergarten that day and couldn't stay home themselves.  It seemed to work alright. Of course, this is just an anecdote, but still.

&gt;How exactly will we be losing half the brightest minds in this country by maintaining the status quo?

Either we have politicians (or professors or specialists) who quit to stay at home and give birth or we have people who will never choose to have children. You don't really have to be top of your field to choose not to have kids.

&gt;And your solution to a lower class family's inability to financially care for their child is to force companies to turn their offices into nurseries?

Well, I'd start by giving paid parental leave to be shared between the parents, so neither parent would be away from work for long while waiting for the kid to be old enough that they can be away from the parents. A company might well have kindergarten nearby or even in the premises so you could start working shorter days sooner. Apparently they [do the latter in Czech Republic](http://www.kindergarten.cz/en/clanek/our-team). 

Obviously any solution must involve stay-at-home husbands, state helping companies with the issues of woman taking a leave due to child etc. as well as having state supported kindergartens near places where people work etc. ",0,1383512439,null,0,false,0,cd5yy1n,t3_1pomgc,t1_cd5yy1n,t1_cd5qp3o,null,1428873732,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,"&gt; You think that the problem with immigrant employment is because they don't want to find jobs? When people with non scandinavian names apply for jobs in Scandinavia, they are far more likely to get turned down than locals. This is a study done in Sweden, yes, but I'm more familiar with the case there and I'm pretty sure you can generalize the results to Norway as well. The problem isn't that immigrants 'don't want to find jobs', it's that the process for them to get jobs is a great deal more arduous and fraught with xenophobia. In a traditionally homogeneous society like Norway's this is understandable, though not condonable. Norway accepted these people into their country, made them citizens, guaranteed them a way of life there, but because Norwegian society is still closed to outsiders this life is increasingly difficult to live in, especially when you're a single immigrant or a small family that has no social networks to depend upon arrival in Norway.

No, I think the majority is interested in working here. The problems are related to integration. There is also a lot of problems with getting immigrant women to work. This is because their husbands live in the stone age. The most important thing is to work with cultural understanding. This means that immigrants must understand how our society works. 

A lot can be done if we reduce immigration. This will actually help those who already arrived here. I live in a small municipality with around 5000 inhabitants. The immigrants who live here is integrated to society. This is because the municipality is good at arranging activities so people can interact with them. Another factor is that they are pretty few, this means that they have to interact with natives. 

Another municipality experienced the same, the only difference is that they started to accept more people because of their experience. What happened? They got consentrated around one area and now they struggle to get them integrated. In Oslo this is very easy to see. How can you integrate people when 99% of the kids at school are immigrants?

&gt; My mother was an immigrant to Australia. She was a highly educated doctor (head of a department at a hospital)

People with higher education have no trouble finding a job here. I actually had an immigrant from Asia as a doctor for a few years, now it's a Swede. 

The problem is those who have no education.

&gt; I think the problem with immigration in Scandinavia doesn't tend to be the immigrants. It's the closed off Scandinavian societies where, if you live in a big city where most immigrants go, don't speak to their neighbours, don't know their names, and assume that 'society' or 'the government' will integrate immigrants, as if it happens by osmosis. Your government, the people your society elected to run the country and represent them, chose to let immigrants in. You, as a society, now have a collective responsibility for the good of your own society to make their transition into mainstream Norwegian life as painless as possible. Just looking at it pragmatically, if you don't want a permanent ghettoized underclass of darker citizens living in your country for generations, Norwegians have to stop hiding behind their government and politicians and try to form some kind of mutual understanding themselves.

This has always been the case in Scandinavia. What do you expect us to do? We are shy by nature. Also it's those who come here who should adapt to our culture, not the other way around.

&gt; But maybe it's too late. Maybe, thanks to more then a decade now of 'immigrants just don't integrate', xenophobia, populist politicians complaining about immigration and newspaper articles portraying immigrants as criminals, that all directly prey on and impact those darker skinned people that you have living in Norway, has made them feel like such outsiders and helped cement a culture of them being resentful to mainstream Norwegian culture, where older brother/sisters tell younger ones not to bother to get a job, or not to bother doing well at school - because the native born Norwegians are against you anyway and wouldn't want to give you a job either, that native Norwegians just don't want you there. After all, that's what they read in the paper, hear from their politicians, and see from untrusting eyes on the street.

This is simply not true. I dare you to look at Norwegian television. It shows lots of positive things about immigrants aswell. We love to see immigrants succeed.

If the immigrants have the attitude that they should just give up, then maybe they should look a little into themselves. They should group up and together show the will to work and integrate. If they just give up there is no suprise why the countries they come from look the way they are.


&gt; This is why I'm not a fan of populist politicians and their xenophobic platforms, like SverigeDemokraterna, Dansk Folkeparti, or Fremskrittspartiet. Every time they rail against immigrants and immigration policy, what they're really doing is sending a big fuck you to all the people that emigrated to Norway and strengthening the differences between native and immigrant born Norwegians.

I think Fremskrittspartiets[ Himanshu Gulati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himanshu_Gulati) would disagree. 

&gt; As for the 'gypsies', yes, there are criminal gangs that run around, commit crime, and try and abuse the fuck out of the system which comprise of 'gypsies'. But do you say 'fucking French' when you hear of a French person committing a crime in Norway, or try and abuse the Norwegian system, or do you put it down to just that individual?

No, because the French takes distance from these actions. For gypsies it's a way of life.

When Breivik commited the terror attack, Norwegians stood together to show that we didn't accept these actions. When jihadists blow themselves up in the Middle-East this doesn't happen.

&gt;Second, I'd say that this is about how women should be able to fit working life and child-rising together. You obviously have a very traditional solution; I'd rather think that society should accommodate women with young kids better. 

How is advocating that parents should focus entirely on the needs of the child as opposed to their own ""traditional""? 

&gt;I thought we were talking about how the views might change in the future. That things are in certain way now doesn't mean they are so in the future; after all, it's a question of legistlation. Bringing that kid to the parliament was a pretty obvious way to show that things could be like this in general. 

No, they could not. Taking care of a child whilst working at the same time would be an impossible task; one of them will be neglected, be it the child or the workload.

&gt;Not a world-ending situation, but the truth is that if a woman has to decide between children and career, she may not always choose children. This might be great as far as world population goes, but not that good as far as developed country goes.

So what? Should the low birthrates of developed nations be such a huge concern for us when there are other, more pressing issues at hand? 

&gt;""Tomita says a woman's chances of promotion in Japan stop dead as soon as she marries. ""The bosses assume you will get pregnant."" Once a woman does have a child, she adds, the long, inflexible hours become unmanageable. ""You have to resign. You end up being a housewife with no independent income. It's not an option for women like me."" Source

A Telegraph article is hardly evidence of anything. Japan's issues are complex and there isn't one single reason people can blame for them.

&gt;I have taken care of kids and I have worked in an environment (office) where people brought their kids in if for one reason or another and they couldn't take them for kindergarten that day and couldn't stay home themselves. It seemed to work alright. Of course, this is just an anecdote, but still.

If it worked well enough we'd have no need for kindergardens. But we do, because parents nowadays believe having a child is like having a pet. You feed it once or twice a day, groom it every week then go on with your life as before. This doesn't apply to children. They're human beings whose future depends entirely on you. 

&gt;Either we have politicians (or professors or specialists) who quit to stay at home and give birth or we have people who will never choose to have children. You don't really have to be top of your field to choose not to have kids.

So nothing would, in fact, change. 

&gt;Well, I'd start by giving paid parental leave to be shared between the parents, so neither parent would be away from work for long while waiting for the kid to be old enough that they can be away from the parents. 

That's a sensible enough policy. I agree with it in principle, though I still see parenting as something that needs to be done full time without work getting in the way. This applies whether or not the child is capable of staying home alone.

&gt;A company might well have kindergarten nearby or even in the premises so you could start working shorter days sooner. Apparently they do the latter in Czech Republic. 

That's different form what you were suggesting.

Groups that may be funded by the Commission itself.

Farage asked the written question in August to the Commission.  He didn't get an answer so he asked it again in September after the break.

&gt; In alcuni casi, però, la conoscenza delle norme morfologiche di formazione del plurale delle lingue straniere più note, come l’inglese, il francese, lo spagnolo e il tedesco, porta chi scrive – in determinati contesti – a formare il plurale dei forestierismi secondo quelle norme: sarà allora opportuno scrivere i plurali usando i caratteri corsivi (i *marines*, i *fuseaux*, le *telenovelas*, i *Lieder*, quest’ultimo con mantenimento della maiuscola iniziale propria dei nomi tedeschi).
&gt; Cionondimeno, vi sono forestierismi entrati nel lessico italiano direttamente nella forma plurale, come jeans (difettivo del singolare già in inglese, analogamente a pantaloni), tanto che i plurali sono talvolta usati impropriamente anche come singolari: un jeans, un fans, un silos, un murales, un vigilantes. Quanto ai ➔ latinismi, è buona norma formare i loro plurali secondo le norme morfologiche latine: curriculum → curricula, lectio magistralis → lectiones magistrales, a meno che non si tratti di latinismi moderni, che restano invariati: gli album, i referendum, gli sponsor.

In the post I linked, you *literally* said that 'most don't even bother to get a job'. 

&gt;The problem is those who have no education.

[page 31 of this OECD report shows that you're completely wrong about that.](http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/43247521.pdf) There's an, on average, 10 percentage point difference between the employment rate of lowly and highly educated immigrants *from non-OECD countries* and native born, and closer to 15% at a medium level of education. For a demographic that globally seeks jobs more desperately than natives, that's pretty telling.

&gt;This has always been the case in Scandinavia. What do you expect us to do? We are shy by nature. Also it's those who come here who should adapt to our culture, not the other way around.

true,ThePhlogist,ENGL,England,"Of course it can, this was never a question of can or can't. The UK would probably be more or less fine outside of the EU. But the benefit to ceding some sovereignty is that the EU uses that sovereignty which we all give to universalise much of the rules and regulations regarding what I'm free to do within the EU. I'm free to travel, live, work, retire, buy property, transfer capital and raise a family in another EU country and I will be treated as a native. I have the freedom (within reason) to enjoy other people's countries and they have the freedom (within reason) to enjoy ours. I value that not just higher than the 'cost' of losing sovereignty (which I don't estimate to be at all high in value BTW) but orders of magnitude more valuable. What we get out of the EU is, for me and in my experience, of much much greater value than what we put in in terms of membership costs and the loss of sovereignty. 

It should also be pointed out that the 'loss of sovereignty' is not total in most cases. In most cases directives are used not regulations. This means the EU sets out the aims of legislation to be passed and it is up to the member state to write the law how ever they want. It may go further or be worded totally differently but it must achieve the aims. This gives member states lots of freedom to decide the way the law is implemented and how wide it may go. The more sensitive the issue the more often directives are used. 

You may disagree but I would like to understand what value you put on keeping total sovereignty in areas of trade and industry and why you think it's more valuable than the ability to use the whole EU for work, life and, of course, play. 

Also, what is your view on the WTO, the UN, NATO or the Commonwealth of Nations. All these organisations necessarily involve some sort of sacrifice of sovereignty in that there are rules which constrain how we act or force obligations on us even if this is only to pay membership fees. Is all this loss of sovereignty bad or is some of it good? Is it merely the case that the EU takes too much sovereignty and if so how much is too much?

To be honest, it's not that I think direct democracy is a bad idea, it's that it relies on the ability to have good discourse between participants to create a workable plan as well as inform the public about its nature. In my view this means adding stronger representation to clarify views and issues while moving the actual decision making towards the public, thus not allowing for secretive horse trading and spurious blaming. 

I don't particularly care if this representation is done through a federative model, community leaders, diverse NGOs, even chambers of commerce. But this sort of discourse has to happen on more than just a ""the telly said"" basis, and it shouldn't over-represent some sections of society over others. (edit: for example high population dense places would have an advantage getting signatures in a limited time period)

 Everyone should have the ability,not just in theory, to gather and form citizen initiatives. Many places have nothing set up to allow for that, and it would be a shame if an attempt at introducing direct democracy should fall apart because of poor preparation.

 - The Swedish government doesn't have a majority. It doesn't want to rely on the Sweden Democrats so the opposition avoids voting against the government, only to keep the Sweden Democrats from power.

Which was wrong by me. I know that most of them want a job, but at the same time some of them don't.

&gt;page 31 of this OECD report shows that you're completely wrong about that. There's an, on average, 10 percentage point difference between the employment rate of lowly and highly educated immigrants from non-OECD countries and native born, and closer to 15% at a medium level of education. For a demographic that globally seeks jobs more desperately than natives, that's pretty telling.

Interesting. I know some immigrants have trouble getting their degrees transferred to be valid in Norway. That may be the reason.

&gt; How are they going to adapt to your culture if the overwhelming majority of Norwegians aren't willing to help them learn it?

We don't? We give them everything they need to learn it. We give them Norwegian classes, we offer their kids free school and we have lots of programs to help them integrate. Some of the work they have to do themselves.

&gt; You know what, I'm going to stop here. I can't be arsed, you completely ignored most of my points, particularly about Norwegian-immigrant culture and how xenophobic rhetoric is supposed to help them integrate better. If you're just going to pick and choose, and then point to one success story of an immigrant that's been coopted by a right wing xenophobic populist group, then I have no time for you. I hope you live out the rest of your life in peace, or something.

What i see is a total lack of understanding of how the Norwegian society and politics work. That you call the progress party a ""right wing xenophobic populist group"" just shows it. The best part is that you come from Australia, a country known for its very strict immigration policies. Compare the progress parties policies to Australian and Asian countries in general. They seem very liberal on the issue compared to them.

A case in point being the banker bonus rules legislation passed by the EU parliament but vehemently opposed by our current government. Putting aside that particular example, even the ability of the EU to pass such a law is something I question, why *does* the EU have the ability to interfere with bonuses in private companies in the UK? Presumably we gave them that power in a previous treaty, but I bet you 99% of the UK population doesn't even have a clue that the EU has that competency. And if they can do that, what else has been transferred to the EU which actually had we realised it was happening we'd have objected too?

I think our politicians like the business people in this article will do anything for a quiet, easy life. I think they'll happily parcel up and give away powers which should stay at Westminster (like bonus rules) in return for staying in the EU.

Well, I'm glad that you accept that.

&gt;Interesting. I know some immigrants have trouble getting their degrees transferred to be valid in Norway. That may be the reason.

It's possible. But put that into the light of the study I first linked to (CVs with Swedish names vs non-Swedish that showed that Swedes were twice as likely to get interviews) and I think there's a strong case for a good deal of that discrepancy down to implicit xenophobia. 

&gt;We don't? We give them everything they need to learn it. We give them Norwegian classes, we offer their kids free school and we have lots of programs to help them integrate. Some of the work they have to do themselves.

Yes, the Norwegian government does wonders for immigrants. I never denied that. My contention was that they can't just learn what it's like to be Norwegian just from government programs and pamphlets. But I don't see how a successful integration policy can work without native Norwegians helping the immigrants integrate, and that's what I was discussing. They do a shitload of the work. The overwhelming majority of them try and learn Norwegian, try and find a job, try and obey the laws, don't cause trouble. But when the host society demonizes them through populist politicians railing against immigrants, or in the media (which, admittedly, isn't as common in Norway with respect to the media), how can they not feel like outsiders?

&gt;The best part is that you come from Australia, a country known for its very strict immigration policies

First. this point isn't relevant, it's a distraction. Second, Australia takes the third or second highest rate per capita of refugees from UN camps in the world. As for 'strict immigration policies', about a quarter of Australian citizens weren't born in Australia, and in the city I'm from, Melbourne, that number is somewhere around 34%

There were no shootings in Linköping.

A 33 year old man for some reason broke in to the basement of a private home in Ljungsbro, a small community at the outskirts of Linköping, with two teenage kids (brothers), the couple living there noticed, called the police and managed to get the younger one of the boys free.

The man then ran away with the other kid and in the street a neighbour couple noticed something was wrong, went to help and it ended with the 33 year old killing both the woman and the boy and put the man in hospital. Some sources online says he beat them to death with an iron pipe but the police has yet to confirm this.

The man is previously known by the police and has a criminal record, and it's believed that he forced the boys down the basement.

Also worth mentioning is that in 2004 an 8 year old boy was stabbed to death on a street in Linköping, and when a 56 year old woman came to help him she was stabbed to death as well.

true,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,"&gt; The overwhelming majority of them try and learn Norwegian, try and find a job, try and obey the laws, don't cause trouble. But when the host society demonizes them through populist politicians railing against immigrants, or in the media (which, admittedly, isn't as common in Norway with respect to the media), how can they not feel like outsiders?

[The vast majority of Norwegians have nothing against immigrants.](http://www.ssb.no/innvhold/) The media has actually been very anti-frp ever since its beginning.

&gt; First. this point isn't relevant, it's a distraction. Second, Australia takes the third or second highest rate per capita of refugees from UN camps in the world. As for 'strict immigration policies', about a quarter of Australian citizens weren't born in Australia, and in the city I'm from, Melbourne, that number is somewhere around 34%

Why isn't it relevant? Now you have gotten a new government which is even more stricter on immigration. The liberal party got twice the amount of voters as progress in Norway. 

UN refugees will never be the same amount as asylum seekers. We accept our fair share and it's not UN refugees people complain about.

In Oslo almost 29% of the population is immigrants. The most popular baby name for males have been muhammed for three years in a row now. We have our fair share. In Australia most foreign born immigrants are from Europe, it really isn't comparable.

&gt; As to FrP, are you really trying to tell me it's not a right wing populist anti immigration party? Because I just checked wikipedia (to refresh my memory), and they claim it is, with multiple sources.

The left-right axis in Norwegian politics is very narrow. The right here is the same as many European labour parties. FrP was funded on a small state and lower taxes, so you can't compare it to Sverigedemokratarna for example.

They are the only party in Norway who wants to limit immigration. They don't even want to stop it.

true,ThePhlogist,ENGL,England,"I understand your concerns with the Euro however I fail to see a future where the UK outside of the Euro has it's economic policy dictated to it by eurozone countries. We have broadly remained out of contributing to bailouts of Eurozone countries. We did not need permission to do this nor will we need permission to opt out of federalising movements in the future. It's worth remembering the most Germans do not want a federal Europe and yet they are supporting the Euro with all their might. There not reason why there cannot be created a 2 tier Europe with Eurozone countries in the centre with integrated financial policies and everyone out side that with competency of their own. Nothing prevents this in theory and in fact I find a federal Eurozone unlikely too for the simple reason that it does not have political approval and world leaders are not so naive as to accidentally find themselves in a new federal nation - were they to realise that some would pull out immediately - I just can't see it happening. 

On the bankers bonuses I don't think it is entirely clear the EU does have competency over pay in private companies - in fact setting pay is specifically excluded from EU competence in the treaty. The EU's social policy states everyone should be treated fairly in terms of working conditions, chance of promotion etc but under s.153 it says:

&gt;'The provisions of this Article shall not apply to pay, the right of association, the right to strike or the right to impose lock-outs'. 

The UK is launching a legal challenge and I honestly think they might win and the ECJ will strike down the law. The justification is very sketchy but just because the parliament passed it does not mean they have competency - the ECJ may rule that they exceeded their powers. 

http://www.lewissilkin.com/en/Journal/2013/September/Lifting-the-lid-on-the-bonus-cap.aspx#.UnbX2_nwaSo

If the public wants to know what power the EU has they can read the [Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:en:PDF). It may be 150 boring pages but it includes every power the EU has. It's well defined, hotly debated and closely studied. I know the public does not know but nothing is being hidden; the public just simply does not care enough apparently. 

I can't see how this is chipping away at our democracy when the banker's bonus law (illegal as it may or may not be) was passed by MEPs voted for by people in the UK and the rest of the EU. What people sometimes mean when making similar arguments is that they don't like the idea that the UK may be legally bound by an obligation voted for by other nations but opposed by us. This objection is not to the EU necessarily but to international law in general. I find the benefits of intentional laws including EU law outweigh the negatives. Nor do I think that politicians and business leaders are keen to give away powers according to no logic. The EU has a specific purpose and an end goal - to create a single market where the rules in trade an industry are the same throughout Europe encouraging trade. That's what we signed up to and the EU requires a finite number of powers as are required to achieve this finite aim. It's not a case of trading rights of citizens to improve business - every competency the EU has is given to improve business by unifying regulations in one way or another. The idea that the EU will suddenly throw off it's shackles and start consuming powers it doesn't want, never asked for and won't use is mostly exaggeration. 

EDIT: Also worth mentioning that part of the EU's justification for the bonus cap was that it was not setting a pay level but merely setting a ration between salary and bonus. Salary can be whatever they like but bonuses awarded on the basis of risk taking make up a smaller part of that pay check encouraging more sensible behaviour.

If the UK leaves, the EU member states lose that. Of course the UK loses heavily too, though the removal of a deficit is much better than the removal of a surplus.

If the UK wants to leave but ends up having to stay because the Institutions play hard ball, then I expect the UK to block any and every future integration opportunity. Having a Member State that wants out but is being kept in (which right or wrong, will become the UK's position as it vilifies Brussels - something we already do) is greatly detrimental to further integration.

Because of this it means that people will vote to remain in the Union and then that will be seen as the end of that.

As for the EU losing the UK market, well that's such a small amount to them it's hardly worth considering. If you do want to consider it then you need only see that about half of British trade is with the EU and about half of most other European countries' trade is with the EU, however if the UK left it would make up a very small amount of the trade with its European neighbours so it's no huge loss to Europe, but it is still a loss, however it is an enormous loss to the UK.

I never said they hated immigrants. I was referring to the way in which Norwegian society handles 'outsiders'. The example I gave of my dear old mum was a society that is accepting and welcoming and friendly to outsiders. I asked you before, but you didn't answer.

How many people do you know that befriended a 'fresh off the boat' immigrant and tried to introduce them to the ways of your society? 

Because, aside from my mother, I can probably name six or seven of all different age ranges. 

&gt;Why isn't it relevant? Now you have gotten a new government which is even more stricter on immigration. The liberal party got twice the amount of voters as progress in Norway.

This is what I referred to before. You know diddly squat about the election in Australia and our immigration policy. The liberal party didn't win, the Labour party lost because they had two public leadership betrayals in the span of a few years, and because the Murdoch press, which owns around 50% of newspaper circulation in Australia, was heavily siding with the Liberals. Their main newspaper, The Australian, once claimed it's goal was to destroy the Australian Green Party, which was in coalition with the Labor party at the time. The liberals didn't win because of immigration policy, the Labor party lost.

Secondly, the 'immigration' debate in Australia doesn't have anything to do with traditional immigrants. It's rather centered around the fact that many refugees, that have already reached safe destinations, but continue on to Australia regardless, board shitty boats in Indonesia and try and land in Australia to claim asylum. Now, I personally have no problem with people coming and wanting to claim asylum, nor do the overwhelming majority of people.

So please, in future, if you're just basing your opinions off of half remembers newspaper articles and reality tv shows - don't.

&gt;They are the only party in Norway who wants to limit immigration. They don't even want to stop it. How about this then, 84% of the population voted for parties that wanted immigration at todays level or more.

I want to very strongly reiterate again: I don't think Norwegians are xenophobic or racist. That said, I do think that they aren't particularly open to foreigners as shown by the discrepancy in employment and problems with integration.

The liberal party didn't win, the Labour party lost because they had two public leadership betrayals in the span of a few years, and because the Murdoch press, which owns around 50% of newspaper circulation in Australia, was heavily siding with the Liberals. Their main newspaper, The Australian, once claimed it's goal was to destroy the Australian Green Party, which was in coalition with the Labor party at the time. The liberals didn't win because of immigration policy, the Labor party lost.

Really? It seems like a bad excuse to be honest. That's like saying Labour lost our election. Most people wanted Abbots policies, simple as that.

Interesting thing about the media.[ In Norway Labour owns most of the media.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amedia)

&gt; Secondly, the 'immigration' debate in Australia doesn't have anything to do with traditional immigrants. It's rather centered around the fact that many refugees, that have already reached safe destinations, but continue on to Australia regardless, board shitty boats in Indonesia and try and land in Australia to claim asylum. Now, I personally have no problem with people coming and wanting to claim asylum, nor do the overwhelming majority of people. What most Australian's do worry about is the frequent boats that sink on the way, including one that had around 30 children on it a month ago that all died. So please, in future, if you're just basing your opinions off of half remembers newspaper articles and reality tv shows - don't.

Sounds like something similar to the boats that sink with several hundreds outside Italy.

I never said Norway wasn't a welcoming country, I said that Norwegian society is closed off to outsiders. But lets continue this at the other place we're discussing this 

&gt;Is the treatment your mom got very normal in Australia?

Literally the next sentence after that is me saying that I know many people that gave that kind of treatment, including two of my friends from my bachelor. They're still friends to this day.

&gt;I should also mention that Norwegians are cold people in general. Most people doesn't even say hello to their neighbors. 

Yes, this is what I'm saying should change if you want to get rid of the majority of problems that immigrants cause in Norway. This has been my thesis the entire time. I haven't been saying Norway is racist, I haven't been saying Norway is telling immigrants to fuck off. I'm saying your closed society, that which I just quoted you saying, is not conduce to integrating immigrants because it doesn't help to instill the values of the host society. So if you have a closed off populace, that doesn't communicate with immigrants on a neighbourly/friendly basis, whilst also having populist anti-immigrant rhetoric being thrown around in public discourse, you're going to have a society which has a clearly demarcated 'native norwegian' vs 'immigrant norwegian' culture.


&gt;I would like to see similar employment statistics for Australia

[Compared to most other OECD countries, Australia has favourable overall outcomes 
for immigrants. Employment of immigrant men is high, and unemployment rates of 
immigrants are among the lowest in the OECD, both in absolute terms and relative to 
the native-born (page 48)](http://www.oecd.org/australia/38164878.pdf)

That one is for all of them (OECD and non-OECD), I couldn't find a direct correlation to the Norwegian case (that is, just non-OECD), but I did find this in the report as well: 

&gt;Unemployment of immigrants from non-OECD countries with 3-5, 6-10 and more than 10 years of 
residence stands at 11, 9 and 5%, respectively. In contrast, unemployment of immigrants from the OECD 
area remains at about 4% for all cohorts with more than two years of residence.

Not just in terms of perception, no they get completely absorbed by the local population. Within one generation they are not Roma anymore. 

And that's the thing, Roma even when homeless and traveling, begging for a living, etc, tend to be very similar to the population of the country they are from. 

Yes there is a Roma language and culture but they are already heavily mixed with national languages and cultures all over Europe. So it's a small step to become completely absorbed. 

And that's part of why people dislike Roma who beg for a living so much, because in a way they do choose that life. Yes discrimination is very real and makes their lives much harder, but still a choice is part of it. 

And on the other hand, if Europe ever does completely solve the Roma problem, Roma might cease to exist. It has happened to many other ethnicities before. Only the Jews were saved from complete absorption thanks to their religion. And non-practicing Jew disappear too. One of my colleagues' grandfather had been a secular Jew. Married a secular Christian. All grandchildren are secular Christians. In just two generations there is nothing uniquely Jewish about them.

Die 9/11-Terroristen planten ihre Anschläge von Deutschland aus, ohne dass die auf Linksterrorismus fixierten Geheimdienste etwas mitbekamen.  Der iranische Geheimdienst kann in Deutschland nahezu ungestört operieren und Regimegegner einschüchtern.  Zuverlässigkeit sieht anders aus.  Vor dem Hintergrund dieser Geschichte einem Verräter wie Snowden (und das ist er de lege nun einmal, auch wenn er aus Gewissensgründen handelte; ein politisch Verfolgter ist er nicht) Asyl zu gewähren, würde bedeuten, sämtliches Porzellan zu zerschlagen, noch die Scherben zu zermahlen und die Bespitzelung rückwirkend zu rechtfertigen, von der unerträglichen Heuchelei ganz zu schweigen: Deutschland hat sich schließlich massiv am Schnüffelsystem der Amerikaner beteiligt und diesem zugearbeitet.  Dass es dennoch einige Politiker fordern, weil sie sich von dieser Bedienung des latenten bzw. manifesten Antiamerikanismus die Sympathie der Wähler versprechen, obwohl sie um die Unmöglichkeit dieser Option wissen, zeigt, für wie strunzdumm sie die Mitglieder ihrer Wählerschaft halten; dass viele von diesen es für tatsächlich möglich halten, zeigt, dass sie tatsächlich so dumm sind.

Diese Fixierung auf die Person Snowden spricht Bände über den Zustand deutscher Politikunfähigkeit.  Snowden hat seinen Dienst geleistet und kann nichts mehr zur Verbesserung der Lage beitragen außer der ständigen Mahnung, die von ihm aufgezeigten Missstände nun endlich zu beheben.

* The medieval period was shaped by the *Reconquista* of northern kingdoms slowly expanding southwards at the expense of the Muslim kingdoms or *Taifas*. During this period what is now Spain was quite diverse religiously with large communities of Jews and Muslims.
* Quite diverse linguistically with four languages having co-official status in their respective *Comunidad Autónoma*: Basque, Catalan, Valencian and Galician. There are also separatist movements in each of these communities.
* 1492 - not only were the Americas discovered but the *Reconquista* ended with the fall of Granada and the conversion (or expulsion) of the Jews. This was followed by a period of consolidation around Catholicism and the Inquisition generally centred around [""New Christians.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converso)
* In the period after the discovery of the Americas Spain became the leading European power of the age. Great works of art and literature were produced. But there was also great wastage such as in [the wars in the Netherlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Years'_War) and enormous monuments like [El Escorial](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Vista_aerea_del_Monasterio_de_El_Escorial.jpg).
* A brutal civil war in the 1930s saw the victory of the Falangists (Nationalists) over the Republicans. As a result, the neo-Fascist dictator Franco would rule Spain from 1939 to 1975.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's a Royal Charter, rather than a law, sure. The same kind of document that founded UK universities and the BBC. So in that regard, they're not technically changing the law. This Royal Charter is pretty vague; it just details the setting up of a body to ensure a self-regulatory press commission does its job well - governing press accuracy, how journalists obtain information, and what information is actually in the public interest. 

All in all, on paper, it's hard to question this. In fact, it sounds like a perfectly reasonable idea. However, the problem is that at any time Parliament will be able to change the Royal Charter to make it more lax or more severe; with a two-thirds majority of MPs, they can alter press regulation. Think about all the Snowden leaks published in the Guardian. The head of MI5, Andrew Parker, accused the Guardian of endangering the UK with these revelations. What if MPs decide to insert a clause in the Royal Charter saying that papers must respect national security and public safety? Again, that doesn't sound so bad in principle, but what we're learning right now with all the stories about Western intelligence agencies is that they and national governments have a very different view about national security than their citizens have. More importantly, whatever these governments are doing, the people have a right to know about them, and want to know about what the NSA, GCHQ, and all other agencies are doing in their name. 

And you may argue that the regulatory body is voluntary, and that's true. But if a paper doesn't join this body then not only will it be easier for people to accuse them of libel (as the Royal Charter will make it easier for such claims to be made against all papers) but this newspaper will have to foot the cost of the entire court proceedings no matter the outcome, and if they lose will have to pay a fine of £1 million. This was actually enshrined in law - the Crime and Courts Act 2013, that said publishers should face punitive measures in libel cases if these publishers weren't part of a regulatory body. Private Eye will be crushed if this happens - they could never afford to pay those kinds of costs, and they won't join the regulatory body on principle. 

Is it likely that government would change the Royal Charter through the two-thirds majority to further restrict the press? I admit, it doesn't seem likely. But the problem is that it would be easier than many people would think. A new government could even change the law that says there would need to be a two-thirds majority to change the Charter. Our peculiar system, with the executive and legislative branches of government rolled into one, doesn't really have many legal restrictions on it. The press is one of the few independent things left to hold government to account, and I guess I'm just worried that phone hacking of the victims of tragedies, and of celebrities, has made people mad enough to restrict the abilities of all journalists to really do good in this country and hold power to account.

Facendo il gioco del risalire a monte del problema, credo che il peccato originale sia la mancanza di una fonte d'energia autoctona. Dover importare energia con le navi ci costa troppo, e non conviene iniziare attività d'impresa sull'isola soprattutto per quei costi.

L'Unione Europea sta cercando di venirci incontro col GALSI, il gasdotto dal Nordafrica, ma sarò onesta....l'ENI maneggia per mettere i bastoni fra le ruote, e finora c'è riuscita.

Poi ci sono altri problemi. Le baronie universitarie sono spesso tali da tagliare le gambe a molte facoltà. Sassari sta meglio della mia Cagliari, ma solo alcune facoltà.

La gente preparata continua a non avere lavoro, e quella meno preparata viene piazzata nello studio di babbo, o quello di zio, o quello del compare. Intanto i miei amici ingegneri trovano solo lavori part time pagati 500 euro l'uno,e combattono ogni giorno coi capi per non dover lavorare in nero. I miei amici di Giurisprudenza, alla terza collaborazione gratis con uno studio, sono tutti immigrati. Alcuni, laureati in ritardissimo ma attivi politicamente, lavorano già seriamente in uno studio. Ne conosco solo due però.

Gli economisti hanno tutti preso il largo. Altri aspettano concorsi della Regione. Gli unici a galla sono i medici, ma nel futuro vedono solo guardie e sostituzioni: mica son tanto sicuri di cosa li aspetta dopo la specializzazione.

Quelli che non hanno finito o cominciato l'università sono alla disperazione più nera. Non sanno le lingue, non sanno come metter su un cv, come cercare lavoro e dove. Fanno le segretarie, poi le cassiere, poi gli assistenti, e tutto dura 6-8 mesi. Sottopagato. Con vari tentativi di incularli.

Molti dicono: scommettete sul turismo. Quello che manca sono le reti. Mettere assieme i produttori delle nostre meravigliose specialità e creare percorsi, pacchetti ed eventi con alberghi, ristoranti e bed&amp;breakfast sembra impossibile. WHY?Ci detestiamo a vicenda e non ci fidiamo. Anni di povertà e di sopravvivenza ci hanno portato a non fidarci di nessuno, soprattutto dei nostri vicini. Di italiani e stranieri ci fidiamo fino a farci inculare, ma del vicino cresciuto assieme a noi, MAI! E' un atteggiamento inculcato da madri e padri:dove il resto dell'Italia ""si fa furbo"", per noi la furbizia è non dare fiducia e presumere che il nostro vicino voglia rubarci tutto.

Yes, venice is in peril of course, but don't think we aren't doing anything about it. Truckloads of money are invested continuously for repairing. indeed, you can always see banks being rebuilt, (public) buildings being repaired and the such. It continuous really, when they're done in a point they begin adjusting another.

Then there's the major investment of [MOSE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSE), a system which is supposed to limit/stop the ""[acqua alta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acqua_alta)"", tides that regularly flood the city and damage infrastructure.

I personally thing cruise docking is a false problem. It raised greatly in popularity lately after the Concordia disaster, as people possibly fear a ship could crash right into venice. But they've been here for a long time and contibute to tourism and associated money circulation that is the only thing keeping venice alive.

One of the problem is that all buildings are in terrible conditions. They're very old, slim, rotten from the water. Houses are impossible to keep warm in winter becouse of the completely absent thermal insulation. My dad once did some carpentry in venice and said he could hardly put a nail on a wall without opening a hole in it. Wooden doors costantly rot. Building modern, efficient building is nearly impossible.
Also, living in venice is very unconfortable for some things. Prices are crazy high, supermarket are rare and have little range of products. I recall a venice friend who once came to land for groceries, and he was shocked at the abundance of products in supermarkets :) Transportation is hard too, all goods are transported by foot or boat.

The real thing is that building a city over the water is not a smart idea :)

Foreign investments are surely welcome. But i'm not sure where to start to help the city. It lives on art, tourism etc. [University](http://unive.it) is also a big player there. There are some important faculties at Ca' Foscari, such as Architecture, and there are many students living in Venice attending the university and contributing to night life. Lately some faculties where moved to Mestre (where there's a detached venue) to overcome the inconveniences of venice. Museums and exhibitions are plentiful in all the city.
All your suggestion could help, i think. Housing is always a problem in venice, for high cost and low quality. There' are ""students houses"" which have lower costs and are assigned to students under certain rules, but i don't think there are many of them.
If you really want to commit time and money to help the city, you firstly should move there. Venice is quite open minded about strangers, you wont suffer racism, and maybe you'll be able to take part in politics at some level, join groups, activits etc. But take this suggestion with caution, i'm not really qualified in this kind of things :)",0,1383562488,null,0,false,0,cd6epbj,t3_1puuiv,t1_cd6epbj,t3_1puuiv,null,1428796988,2,false,Venezia,t5_2t1es,2

Incredibly what de Gaulle complained about was the ability of the US to just keep printing. That because everyone had to buy dollars anyway it gave the US room to just make free money.

With China buying up every Euro it can get its hands on we could have printed our way out of the Eurozone crisis already. All paid for by China's attempt to fiddle its own currency downwards. The only people who'd actually pay for this policy would be China. Who find themselves effectively giving Europe a lot of money while the exchange rate remains unmoved.

Credo che questa classificazione esista.

La musica è buona in funzione di una serie di fattori: la motivazione per cui la scrivi (dal puro atto creativo non retribuito, all'atto artistico retribuito ma che non ha la retribuzione come obiettivo principale), quanto è innovativa, quanto è virtuosa (in confronto a semplice / triviale), i contenuti che ha (testi), l'interpretazione del sentimento del proprio tempo e quindi la capacità di essere rilevante.

La musica merda è quella pensata e prodotta solo per vendere, che spesso non ha le caratteristiche di cui ai punti sopra. Purtroppo finiscono per ricadere in questa area anche pezzi che sono sovraesposti in maniera ingiustificata rispetto al loro valore.

I confini sono comunque labili e l'umiltà è sempre d'obbligo: credo che tutti si sia mangiata un bel po' di merda nel mentre che i nostri gusti musicali si andavano formando. Non tutti gli artisti hanno fatto sempre e solo musica e mai merda. Insomma, ci sono un sacco di condizioni al contorno, ma la suddivisione c'è.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I thought so too. It's used in Helsinki even for the old 19th century apartment buildings. Nobody burns coal or oil. But somehow they do in Poland, so I assumed that this idea never found fertile ground there.  

It's used in Helsinki because it makes economical sense there and Helsinki is a new city (in Krakow many buildings are even from XIII century). Water loses heat in even in best insulated pipes and it costs energy to pump it, so this system is used only when the generators are close enough and population density is enough.  
Isn't it obvious?  
You can even see a gas heater installation in breaking bad - do you think they didn't hear about cogeneration in USA?  

The alternative is local gas heating, not a city-wide network.  

Coal is and for the most of history was cheaper than gas, because Poland has and had enormous resources of it, so gas was never used until recently, same for oil. Pollution is the only reason to leave coal, but individual owners are obviously going to oppose spending more money. In really old historical buildings it's additionally a very complicated operation - every major change needs a special permit.  

Heat pumps (both from soil and sun) are completely uneconomical on their own, only for about two years or so they seldom are, due to funding from European Union. Basically the only people who are installing them are doing it in fear of future rise of prices, not because it makes sense now.  

&gt;Perhaps it's because in Finland it's possible for a company buy shares in a electricity plant and instead of money get the value of of the shares in electricity tax free, as it's ""inside the family"" so to speak?

The table is for price without tax.  
That's a very weird system you have though. So a large consumer can buy a shitload of shares, then ""sell"" them for current price, effectively getting electricity at company's cost?

Il pense pas que ce sont des esclaves car ils manifestent.

Et que donc en défendant ce genre de pratique qui font du quasi esclavage moderne déguisé ils défendent un esclavagiste. Et indirectement, en déclarant les défendre car ca ""crée des postes dont ils pourraient bénéficier"" ils signent leur propre quasi esclavage légal.

I'm saying that the change which has happened isn't part of a larger trend of moving towards an eglitarian society brought about by the ending of monarchy. People's lives always change over 100 years, especially in this age of rapid tecnological advancment.

I'm saying that, funamentally the new systems of government we have are not actively tryign to do away with economic disaprity, a political system that favours a certain class, the power of big business, fighting imperialist wars, etc.

Does the government now represent your interests any more than that of 100 years ago? Hell the Atlee government, in my opinion, better represents the needs of the average person than the  current government does. 

&gt;There's still poverty in 2013, but wealth has exploded for millions, certainly in western Europe on a huge scale. To say little has changed is to deny reality.

But ultimately the large part of the wealth and power still rests with a relatively small amount of the population. In a world of billions is matter little for the billions whether 1 or 100 or 5000 people hold the majority of the wealth and power.

And as I've argued elsewhere the end of monarchy was the avent of the boruegious. Some, such as small shopkeepers got left behind but the clerks, beurecrats, lawyers, business men, factory owners, etc have merely taken the power and money from the nobility and kept it for themselves instead of redistributing it. 

Also technology and economic realities mean there is more to go around now, so of course people are better off. But look at the fundameantals; don't look at the quality of life, look at the differences in qualitys of life between classes, think about the type of work many people are forced to work in, think about the uncertain future you and everyone else has, think about who still makes the largest profit of the sweat and toil of others.

Non car ils font office de figure. Mais leurs petits soldats, les skinhead, en ont très souvent.

&gt; Quelle est la définition de fascisme ? 

Ma définition de fascisme designe un système d'idéologie ou un groupe monte au pouvoir et :

- Reigne en accusant un autre groupe (de nos jours les immigrés/maghrébins/musulmants/pauvres/étrangers); les accusent de tous les problèmes de société (et si ils sont pas assez crédible pour tout braquent les autres pays autour. CF la politique lourdement anti européenne et isolationiste du FN même publiquement) 

- Maintiennent cette haine ou méfiance hostile contre ces groupes et tout le monde autour plutôt que chercher à fixer les dits problèmes de société (probablement car ils en sont incapable et que la violence et se priver de 20% de la population pour s'en servir comme souffre douleur c'est pas idéal pour ca; de même que rejetter toute l'europe); 

- commence à avoir des stormtroopers dans la rue mènent une série d'actions de plus en plus publique pour les réprimer en contant sur le ""feels good"" de leurs electeurs pour que personne ne bouge (comme les flics tabassant les noirs en grèce et s'en tirant sans rien car tlm regarde dans l'autre sens). Comme les skinhead ou ""identitaires"" (chemises brunes francaises) tabassant les immigrés/homos/blacks/... en France.

- Isolent totalement le pays (""quitons l'europe ! retournons au franc ! Fin des accords de libre échange ! non à l'immigration !"") de tout le reste du monde

- Maintiennent que c'est une compétition violente pour des ressources limités (""c'est eux ou nous !"" ""ils nous volent nos jobs !""); facile à déformer en tenant compte du contexte socio économique et s'en servent comme raison pour justifier leur ultra violence permanente.

- Profitent généralement du militarisme rampant pour tenter d'envahir autour ou menacer, posturer pour obtenir ce qu'ils veulent. Je n'accuse absolument pas le gouvernement actuel de le faire mais le FN lorgne clairement sur l'armée fr en afrique; cf la campagne du mali.

- Détournent le gros des ressources vers l'état et leurs groupes de soutient pour consolider leur pouvoir à tout prix. Et si on critique, la réaction varie entre la censure, l'envoi de stormtroopers identitaires pour intimider l'opposition ou l'accusation de soutenir ""ces fuckin immigrés qui volent tout"" (durant la WWII toute personne critiquant les nazis finissait souvent arrêtée par la gestapo et envoyée dans un camp avec les juifs).

- Ne soutiennent la démocratie que jusqu'à avoir été élu à la tête du pays (bha non une fois qu'ils sont élu le pouvoir ils le gardent). C'est entre autre pour ca qu'ils arrivent autant à faire du pied aux royalistes j'imagine.

- Intimidation systématique de l'opposition (là encore , skinheads, identitaires, ...).

- Le racisme ambiant. Je passerait de commentaires sur les sympathisant qui parlent de taubira comme un singe parce que ce genre de mentalités m'énerve en france au XXI siecle. On est plus en 1500  ou c'était acceptable de cracher sur les gens car ils sont pas nés là ou tu voulait ou avec la couleur de peau que tu voulait bande de pauvres cons. -_- . Entendre parler de ""supériorité raciale"" me donne envie de cogner.

- Ont souvent des nostalgies de régimes impéralistes passés surtout connus pour avoir conduit des actions inhumaines; qu'ils soutiennent implicitement. CF Les skinheads avec les croix gammeés tattouées sur le front ou empilant les artefacts SS/Nazi comme des drapaux, uniformes, ...

- Ultra nationalisme ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultranationalism#Ultranationalism ) qui est un gros redflag indiquant qu'il faut s'enfuir en courant quand les gens commencent à prêcher ce genre d'idées 

- Etc etc.

Loro sono onesti,e non hanno alcun controllo su coloro che si comportano male.

true,eleytheria,null,null,"&gt; da circa un anno e mezzo, il saldo delle partite correnti della Germania continua a crescere mentre il disavanzo dei maggiori paesi dell'area euro (fatta eccezione per la Francia) si è invertito. Ne ho dedotto che non c'è relazione di necessità tra gli avanzi commerciali della Germania da un lato e il saldo commerciale del sud Europa dall'altro. In questo post porto altri dati in risposta alle critiche ricevute.

&gt;Le critiche si riassumono, essenzialmente, così: quella figura non dimostra che sia in atto un ribilanciamento all'interno dell'area euro, perché il saldo totale della Germania potrebbe essere in gran parte ancora dovuto a un saldo positivo verso gli altri paesi dell'area euro, i quali a loro volta potrebbero aver compensato il disavanzo coi tedeschi con un avanzo verso il resto il mondo.

&gt;Le due figure sotto offrono indizi contro questa possibilità. La prima figura mostra che durante gli ultimi 4 anni l'avanzo commerciale tedesco verso i paesi extra-area euro è cresciuto di circa 20 miliardi, mentre nello stesso periodo si è ridotto di circa 20 miliardi quello verso i paesi dell'area euro. La seconda figura mostra che, di conseguenza, l'incidenza dell'avanzo tedesco verso i paesi dell'area euro sul totale dell'avanzo tedesco e' drasticamente diminuito: questa ha oscillato attorno al 60% fino al 2010. Oggi e' al 20%. Gli squilibri commerciali all'interno dell'area euro (nel senso dei flussi, naturalmente) sono quindi in forte ridimensionamento, e il saldo positivo della Germania, da un anno e mezzo, e' sia in aumento come mostrato nel precedente post sia dovuto in modo preponderante a un avanzo verso paesi extra-europei.

Premesso che la musica nasce come atto culturale ancor prima che come atto artistico, partire dall'idea che buona musica equivalga a determinati autori significa chiudersi ad altri generi ed autori soltanto in quanto non appartenenti a una cerchia riconosciuta come tale.

Il presupposto basilare di molti è che la buona musica si ritrovi soltanto in un determinato tipo di rock: questa è una menzogna imbarazzante. Io ascolto prettamente elettronica, e rispondo a chi dice che la buona musica non è elettronica invitando ad ascoltare ""Nova"" o ""Illusion"" dei VNV Nation, o ""Southern Sun"" di Paul Oakenfold. E anche nel Pop più commerciale si può trovare dell'ottima musica, vedi ""The power of love"" dei Frankie goes to Hollywood.

Inoltre, io ascolto moltissimo anche Wagner e Shostakovic (si, nel mio lettore mp3 c'è davvero di tutto...): cosa dovrei rispondere a uno che mi etichetta soltanto Led Zeppelin e Pink Floyd come ""buona musica""? Che se quella è buona, quella di Wagner e Shostakovic è suprema?

L'idea di partenza, per quel che mi riguarda, è che alla musica ciascuno è libero di chiedere quel che vuole, senza sciocchi paletti. Io posso chiedere alla musica di rendermi spensierato, e per questo ascoltarmi ""Sarà perchè ti amo"" dei Ricchi e poveri in repeat, e in tal caso quella per me sarebbe buona musica. 
Se invece vogliamo focalizzarci sull'aspetto artistico più che culturale, dovremmo essere abbastanza aperti da non fermarci a 5-6 gruppi universalmente ritenuti ""buoni"", e cercare la bontà anche altrove. Altrimenti ci sarà sempre qualcuno che al nostro ""i Led Zeppelin sono il top"", ti risponderà ridendo ""vai a cagare tu e queste canzoncine: io ascolto solo Verdi, Beethoven e Chopin.""",0,1383566166,null,0,false,0,cd6f6zk,t3_1pv7nv,t1_cd6f6zk,t1_cd6euf6,null,1428796759,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

Poi, se vuoi, parliamo della teoria dei cluster d'innovazione.

Che per inciso, è un po' più complessa di quel che si crede. Leggi: in Finlandia fanno nanotecnologia dove prima pascolavano solo le renne. Non si fa innovazione solo in centro a Milano. Basta voler creare i presupposti e si fa. Per esempio, su un'Isola circondata dal mare e facoltà non malvagie di biologia, chimica, etc, si può fare ricerca sull'uso delle alghe come filtro per scorie o come biodiesel. Non è impossibile, sarebbe fattibile. Se non si fa è per vari motivi. Uno fra tutti, come ho detto l'energia.

Senza andare sulla ricerca però, si potrebbe migliorare quello che abbiamo già, come agroalimentare e turismo. E anche li ho spiegato come e perchè.

Scholarships Erasmus increasingly restrictive

The government quietly changed the criteria for receiving financial aid should be awarded a scholarship Erasmus. The amendment, published in the Official Gazette of October 29, includes as a prerequisite that the student benefiting from a general grant for the grant of the Ministry of Education.
José Ignacio Wert, minister of education

The Ministry of Education has changed the law with respect to Erasmus. If you had told melty.es and that the scholarships to study abroad with this program could become extinct , is now that we know that the Government has approved a new cut of the same. In the Official Gazette dated October 29 has been quietly published a change in the rules regarding the financing of the same. And it is now a requirement to have been the beneficiary of a general scholarship for financial support provided by the Ministry of Education ""grant recipients are students selected for participation in the Erasmus program during 2013 - 2014 [...] and that in turn have been recipients of a grant from the so-called general granted by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports for the 2012/2013. ""

More news on Scraps 2013 Scraps 2013: Erasmus endangered

If the reform of the Education Act (LOMCE) known as 'Wert Act' had already caused a stir among parents, teachers and students , the Ministry of Education is back in the spotlight with this new regulation. The news fell like a cold water for students who are already enjoying their stay abroad and had the help of the Ministry in order to sustain itself. As is the case with Andrea, a student at Valencia's 22 years in telecommunications engineering which was awarded an Erasmus scholarship to study in Brno, Czech Republic, during the current academic year: ""I would not say it looks normal now, we all knew he was going to cut but not taking anything I think the last straw. "" She does not meet the requirements for eligibility for general scholarship, so you will not get the help the Ministry offered to students. ""Moreover, the Czech Republic provides scholarships if you live in residence, you get about 75 euros every three months. I get more help the Czech Republic that my own country, ""he says indignantly.

Erasmus Scraps 2013 Seneca

**With the new rules, only those who received a general scholarship aid may receive the Erasmus program intended MEC**

So far, monthly aid offered to students participating in the European mobility program Erasmus was about 115 euros by the European Union over the amount that your university in Spanish territory destined to the mobility of students. The Ministry of Education could provide assistance ranging from 100 to 300 euros a month at best, depending on family income, ""Basically through the scholarship could pay my accommodation, so that my expenses were reduced to the same as if they continued living in Madrid ""confesses Alberto, a journalism student and Audiovisual Communication 22:"" Without the scholarship families must make a great effort. "" He enjoyed an Erasmus stay during 2011-2012 in Toulouse, France.

The truth is that to meet the payment of support themselves when outside the family home is no easy task for a student.

true,ThePhlogist,ENGL,England,"Yeah, perhaps. The government has been elected though; in the UK system it seems to generally accepted that the government is free to govern without much interference. The House of Lords is realistically no obstacle to laws passing so as long as your party has a majority in the House of Commons you can pass any law. With 30-40% you can get most things passed without too much trouble provided it's not totally abhorrent to the other party. If we have problems with the system they often arise from the government being too free to do things we don't like than the government being unable to do anything at all (like the US congress for instance). 

Besides it doesn't happen a whole lot. It will only occur when the bill aims to removes some of the these royal powers that the government can now use. If it doesn't concern one of those powers they can't use the veto. They can't veto a law about political rights or education or healthcare or defence or any of that stuff because none of it affects those royal powers. 

EDIT: OK here's a very limited and vague list of prerogative powers. It's very difficult to define the scope if these powers because they are merely defined as the powers that haven't been taken the monarch already from the days when monarchs were absolute:

&gt;the issuing and withdrawal of passports
&gt;
&gt;the appointment and dismissal of government ministers
&gt;
&gt;the appointment of Queen's Counsel (very senior lawyers)
&gt;
&gt;the granting of honours

&gt;the appointment and regulation of the civil service

&gt;the commissioning of officers in the armed forces

&gt;the dissolution of Parliament

&gt;the calling of elections

&gt;the declaration of war and deployment of troops abroad

&gt;the making of treaties

&gt;the recognition of foreign states

&gt;the accreditation of diplomats

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"&gt; Der Supreme Court hat 2006/07 Whistleblowing für vertretbar mit dem Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung erklärt

Ich hab noch mal nachgeschlagen, und die Anklage gegen Snowden lautet auf Diebstahl von Regierungseigentum, unbefugte Weitergabe die Landesverteidigung betreffender Informationen und vorsätzliche Weitergabe geheimer, die Fernmeldeaufklärung betreffender Informationen an Unbefugte.  Da er für die Geheimdienste tätig war, wird er die üblichen Verschwiegenheitsvereinbarungen unterschrieben haben.  Der Supreme Court hat in *Snepp v. United States* entschieden, dass solche, das Recht auf freie Rede einschränkende Vereinbarungen keine Verletzung der Verfassung darstellen.  Snowden hat also gegen das Gesetz verstoßen, und amerikanische Whistleblower-Schutzgesetze garantieren lediglich, dass man für das Verpfeifen von Vorgesetzten und das Aufdecken von Missständen keine beruflichen Nachteile wie Kündigung, Versetzung usf. zu erleiden hat.  Sie gewähren keine Immunität für mit dem Akt des Whistleblowings verbundene Gesetzesverstöße.

Militärangehörigen und -dienstleistern ist es erlaubt, sich bei Fehlverhalten von Vorgesetzten, Missständen etc. an Kongressmitglieder (und auch nur die) zu wenden.  Ein ähnlicher Mechanismus für Geheimdienstmitarbeiter wäre nötig gewesen, aber den gab es nicht, weswegen Snowden in der Bredouille saß.

&gt; wenn Snowden jetzt in den USA vor Gericht gestellt werden soll (und daran besteht nach Aussage diverser Regierungs- und Verwaltungsmitglieder kein Zweifel), kann man das nur als politisch motiviert bezeichnen

Vor ein Gericht gestellt zu werden, heißt erst einmal noch gar nichts.  Politisch motiviert wäre es, wenn der Prozess nicht ergebnisoffen geführt würde, und die Richter nicht unabhängig wären.

&gt; zu glauben, Snowden würde bei einem solchen Prozess nicht bis an sein Lebensende eingesperrt, halte ich für naiv.

Angesichts der reichlichen Presseberichterstattung und den vielen Äußerungen, die er getätigt hat, wird an seiner Schuld auch kaum ein Zweifel bestehen.  Überdies beträgt die ihm drohende maximale Strafe 30 Jahre Gefängnis, wenn nicht weitere Anklagen hinzukommen.  Ein Urteil würde wohl darunter liegen, weil seine Motive ehrenwerter Natur waren.  Die effektive Haftdauer wäre noch kürzer.

&gt; Aber hier ist imho die Aufklärung der Weltbevölkerung über (ebenfalls weitgehend illegale oder zumindest rechtlich arg fragwürdige) Praktiken eines Staates (die haben die UN ausspioniert!) das erheblich höhere Gut, das wir als Gesellschaft schützen sollten.

Für die US-Justiz ist das nicht von Belang.  Ihre Aufgabe ist die Wahrung der Gesetze der USA.  Die Rechtmäßigkeit der Bespitzelung ausländischer Staatsbürger ist ebenso unerheblich für die Frage, ob Snowden Recht gebrochen hat oder nicht.  Und die Aufklärung der Weltbevölkerung besorgt Glenn Greenwald, dafür bedarf es keines Asyls für Snowden.

Penso che la cosa vada contestualizzata. ""Segui l'istinto/il cuore"" secondo me è la cosa giusta da fare se tutto ciò che ti dice ""il cervello"" è solo per paura di fare cambiamenti, in assenza di rischi reali. In quel caso ""seguire l'istinto"" vuol dire semplicemente ""buttarsi senza farsi troppe paranoie"".

Di solito quando si usa questa frase è in contesti del tipo: ""vorrei tanto fare questa cosa che sarei felicissimo di fare, ma non lo faccio per non fare brutta figura/deludere i miei/fare un cambiamento nella mia vita"" oppure ""mi piace questa persona ma ho paura che se mi faccio avanti mi rifiuterà"", ecc.

Secondo me in questi casi ci sta tutto, e può portare solo cose buone.

Portare la frase fuori dal contesto e usarla per farsi belli o per esaltare l'irrazionalità o per giustificare qualsiasi str...anezza o che so io è un'altra faccenda, e non ha niente a che vedere col significato originale, che certamente non è ""non devi usare la testa"".

And it's a quite big bucket too.

This depends on what you mean by ""bureaucracy.""

He can and does destroy the public sector. I am politically against that. So are most Greeks. I do not have the time to look up any data for it, so take it as you will but you will not find many Greeks that are for privatizing the health, education, mass transit etc. sectors. The government's argument is that ""public sector equals bad"" and that by cutting it or eliminating it the healthy private sector will take over and everything will be better. I think that their ""small government"" argument is just a cover for all the actions that have been made towards meeting the troika quotas. I.e. ""we are getting fucked but it is good for us.""

If by ""bureaucracy"" you mean that he will eliminate the (very real) bureaucracy and corruption in the public and private sector then, no. The bureaucracy and corruption are both very much here. From the small things like small scale bribery, uninsured and black market labour, and small scale tax evasion to big things like Big Corp briberies to high government officials, huge subsidies and tax cuts to friendly entrepreneurs and mass hirings of people who are ""friendly dispositions towards the leading parties.""

Edit: a quick glimpse (from wikipedia):

In 1940, during the early days of World War II, Pujol decided that he must make a contribution ""for the good of humanity""[3] (and to oppose the Franco regime) by helping Britain – which, with its Empire, was Germany's only adversary at the time.[17][23]

He initially approached the British three different times,[3] including through his wife (though Pujol edited her participation out of his memoirs),[17] but they showed no interest in employing him as a spy. Therefore, he resolved to establish himself as a German agent before approaching the British again to offer his services as a double-agent.[17]

Pujol created an identity as a fanatically pro-Nazi Spanish government official who could travel to London on official business;[3] he also had created for himself a fake Spanish diplomatic passport via fooling a printer into thinking Pujol worked for the Spanish embassy in Lisbon.[26] He contacted Friedrich Knappe-Ratey, a German Intelligence agent in Madrid codenamed ""Frederico"",[27] and German Intelligence accepted him and gave him a crash course in espionage, including secret writing, a bottle of invisible ink, a codebook and 600 pounds for expenses. His instructions were to recruit a network of British agents.[3]

He moved instead to Lisbon, and – using a tourist's guide to England, reference books and magazines from the Lisbon public library and newsreel reports he saw in cinemas – created seemingly credible reports that appeared to come from London.[3] He claimed to be travelling around Britain and submitted his travel expenses based on fares listed in a British railway guide. A slight difficulty was that he did not understand the pre-decimal system of currency used in Britain,[28] expressed in pounds, shillings and pence, and was unable to total his expenses. Instead, he simply itemised them, and said he would send the total later.[29]

In case you believe in the first theory, you are ready to say that even something like pollution can be fixed by the market. Thus, you would believe that citizens would be so concerned that they would inform themselves and not buy polluting devices, forcing the producers to only produce ""clean"" devices. To this day, I believe such case has never happened.

In the second theory, the market can actually fail. One would believe that since the only aim of firms is to achieve profit, and consumers are too lazy/badly informed/not caring about the environment, something like pollution is unavoidable. However, pollution is a price which falls completely on the citizens' shoulder. They die because of it, and they have to pay higher taxes to make sure that the health system will at least try to save their lives. Since this is considered too costly for the citizens, those who believe this theory consider appropriate that the government may curb this tendency, taxing firms which pollute, or banning polluting items.

Now, it is not about being stupid. These are too different views of the world. Generally, traditional economists tend to see a person, or an economic actor, as a rational thinker, who tries to maximize their benefit. Other, more recent theories, say that we are not talking aout Homo Erectus, but....Homer Simpson. People are lazy, and to be lazy, sometimes, they act against their own interest.

It was 'sex liberation' that destroyed the 60s movements as it promoted reckless behaviour and was anti family. Manson, for instance, had a harem of women.  Look at what promotion of sex and alcohol is bringing to us.  
The abandonment, and sheer evil that is being done to children these days due to unfit and absentee parents.  Criminal. **Life** is being **cheapened**. 

Associated problems with these things will *compound* in the coming generations. Multiculturalism and Race mixing are only big concerns if the principals and way of life here is bad and with our attitude to alcohol, sex and setting a shit example for the diverse, uneducated, and disadvantaged foreigners etc, there is a serious long-term problem. We must get the alcohol and the bullshit out now, and make life meaningful and people principled. Only a fool would really think a society that sells tesco value vodka is condusive to a complex multiculturalism. **And the idiots that keep alcohol legal are fewer in number than you might think. )They currently control social centerpoints (pubs, bars, nightclubs)** Alcohol is illegal until 18, so people know there is something wrong. The people in the alcohol trade and scene give you the impression that they are big critical businessmen, politicians, from well established family business traditions, etc and they want you to think that the alcohols legality **can't be changed** but its all lies.   

This is an extremely critical time for Irish society that will determine what life here is like in 15/30 years time. Some of the sort that are on **reddit** are cleverly guiding us to further chaos. They are TRAITORS to children. Others are still childishly selfish/stupid and go along with it just to be trendy and get pseudofriends (eg reddit meetups, prochoice rallys). They have no right right to disempower us.  They want you afraid of voicing *your own* opinion. Accept destructive deviance occuring throughout Ireland. Work hard for crumbs and expensive rented accomodation and Insurance while your taxes you pay work against you. Dumb down, enjoy your alcohol and be just like the other glib trendy with no spine in your college. I couldnt give a damn if they know who I am or not, because fuck them, its our country and we have already proven that one poster on reddit ireland is not Irish but an Argentinian who essentially told irish lgbt, without mentioning the sleeping around aspects, to be 'natural allies' with pro abortion on demand(DIRTY TACTIC) Perfect example of our direction being hijacked through this **pornsite**.
At the moment now we have people from around the world having children here so they can be given citizenship, many of the ones I met are behaving very wantonly and destroying our society by sleeping around.  Many foreigners are manipulating and even raping women here, especially foreign women and Irish with broken families because they know you will do jack shit about it and don't know them. And this out of sight, out of mind attitude is related to the same goodwill, trusting shit that let them into the country, improperly screened, in the first place, for the working class to suffer and deal with.  The *atmosphere* in a lot of modern day Ireland is really uncomfortable due to the level of  distrust, and bad behaviour caused by the reckless promotion of sex and destructive drinking culture. So what do the we currently have to offer the foreigners and our shared next generation.   
Natives and non natives are pointing at the failings of the other but it is **INDIVIDUAL INDULGENCE** (alcohol and sleeping around) that is destroying all and our childrens future. There are NO REPERCUSSIONS when there really needs to be. Currently **our laws actually protect their behaviour**. If you want to be a macho, criminally reckless cunt having kids to 4 different mothers YOU CAN. APPARENTLY THATS YOUR RIGHT! But if you criticise these freedoms and refuse to be a trendy, you are outcasted on reddit, because your job was to talk about celebrities, football, and trivial bullshit. ( The trendies actually do believe in the karma voting system. And look how so many of their posts have a political slant. 
They are shit scared of my points and have been deleting my posts for over a year. The sad truth is they are further destroying life here for children by **normalising bad behaviour**)

Furthermore, we are *paying* the wrong people having kids. The women have no reason to go for nice guy betas when the betas and the women who don't behave like dogs will pay for the alpha-studs often badly raised, often sociopathic kids and for the welfare of the slut/stud parents. The alpha gives the woman that primitive protected feeling of a father who they likely havent seen much of these days. Also they know the next generation of reckless zombie sluts are going to want alphas also, such is the trend. That prevalent absentee father shite needs to be stopped. As does the suicides of betas. Dont support single mothers  shit behaviour by entering into relationships with them.
  
Ask yourself how much do the *prochoice* care for kids after they're born.  
**Also, Myself and others are working on a social revolution, bordering on vigilantism.
Politics cant touch the  problems this society has but something has to be done about these estates and apartment towers full of single mothers, badly raised kids and this joyless pro-alcohol environment. Shut down the pubs and the nightclubs through any means possible. It will get a lot of the drinking, the idiocy and the unfit parents finished in one blow. Enough is enough.

Das sind nicht Leute deren Meinungen und Ansichten diffarmiert werden (Die ""Meinungen"" sind all over the Internetz und du plapperst es grad nach ohne, dass dich jemand dran hindert). 

Das sind Leute die sich selbst diffarmieren. Schau doch einfach mal deine Beiträge hier an. Du hast dich in Grund und Boden blamiert. Wahrscheinlich ist das gleiche mit deinen vorhergehenden Accounts passiert (Ich tippe stark auf einen der AfD-Clone die plötzlich wieder weg waren). 

Eine weitere Sache die mir aufgefallen ist, ist die selbst herbeigeführte Illusion von einer wachsenden Menge von Supportern. Diese Illusion/Verblendung ist so stark, dass trotz mind. 3 gescheiterter Parteien und sinkenden Besucherzahlen (Spendenbettlerei, gefälschte Statistiken, etc.) die Leute noch immer denken es würden immer mehr deren Ideen folgen. Paradox ist es vor allem weil das worauf diese Beobachtung gestützt wird meist Onlineumfragen sind die von Beteiligten teilweise selbst frisiert werden. 

Woher kommt den deine Idee davon es würde immer mehr geben? Von den immer neuen Accounts die du erstellst?

&gt; Wäre in Deutschland eine Diskussion über solche Themen ohne ideologische Verblendung möglich, würden wir nicht in einer alternativlosen Sackgasse stecken, in der Menschen wie du immer noch propagieren alles sei schön und toll und alle profitieren. 

Sagmal, ist das irgendwie eine Art von Textgenerator? Wie kommst du dazu sowas zu schreiben nachdem ich dich oben dermassen zerlegt hab, dass dir nichts anderes übrig blieb als einem gestörten Kind zuzustimmen? Du hast es nicht einmal geschafft einen Absatz zu schreiben ohne wieder fäkal zu werden :-D

Du bist kein Massstab. Ausser vielleicht für den niedrigen Bildungsstand in diesem Land und ich bezweifle auch stark, dass du überhaupt einen Hauch von Ahnung davon hast was ""ideologische Verblendung"" überhaupt ist. 

Mal abgesehen davon...wo hab ich irgendwas von schön und toll propagiert? Du hast doch gar nicht verstanden wo das Problem beim Thema ist. Deswegen bist du ja auch schon davon abgerückt. Das was du hier hintextest ist das übliche haltlose Verschwörungsgeblubber, dass man heute überall von euch lesen kann. Hat wahrscheinlich kewil irgendwann vordefiniert seitdem wird das nachgeplappert.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; This Royal Charter is pretty vague; it just details the setting up of a body to ensure a self-regulatory press commission does its job well

And that body has no power over the press. All it can do is ""recognise"" or ""not recognise"" a regulator. The press can simply ignore it and not create a regulator, or create one that doesn't seek recognition.

If the Royal Charter *did* seek to give power to a body over the press there is a good chance it would be thrown out by the courts (as being outside the powers of the Royal Prerogative).

&gt;  at any time Parliament will be able to change the Royal Charter to make it more lax or more severe; with a two-thirds majority of MPs, they can alter press regulation.

At any time Parliament can do that with a simple majority. That's the principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty. It is (in theory, in practice probably not) *harder* for Parliament to regulate the press through this Royal Charter than on their own (hence the reason it is being done by Royal Charter). Additionally, if Parliament does pass a press regulation law, which it is free to do so at any time, it would be much harder for the Courts to object.

&gt; And you may argue that the regulatory body is voluntary, and that's true. But if a paper doesn't join this body then not only will it be easier for people to accuse them of libel (as the Royal Charter will make it easier for such claims to be made against all papers) but this newspaper will have to foot the cost of the entire court proceedings no matter the outcome, and if they lose will have to pay a fine of £1 million. This was actually enshrined in law - the Crime and Courts Act 2013, that said publishers should face punitive measures in libel cases if these publishers weren't part of a regulatory body.

That isn't quite what the law does or how it works.

The [relevant parts](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/22/part/2/crossheading/publishers-of-newsrelated-material-damages-and-costs) of the Crime and Courts Act (which aren't in force) do the various things. What they don't do is:

* make claims against publishers easier to make (directly),
* make Publishers foot the cost of entire court proceedings no matter the outcome,
* give courts the power to impose fines on publishers.

What it does do is;

* put on a statutory basis the rules for exemplary damages, giving publishers immunity from them if they were covered by an approved regulator and the regulator either imposed a reasonable sanction itself, or reasonably decided not to. Exemplary damages are already a thing, and can already be used against newspapers. They are really rare, and we won't know until this law happens (if it ever does) whether that will change. So on this count, at least in theory, the new law is better for publishers.

* put the system of aggravated damages on a statutory basis (for publisher-related cases). Again, these are already available (but rare). It's unclear if this new law actually changes the position, or simply restates it. It may or may not make them more common. Whether a publisher is signed up to an approved regulator doesn't matter.

* changes the default position for costs.

Costs awards are already fairly flexible. The default position is that the loser pays (the majority of) the winner's costs after a trial. But the Courts have discretion to change this as the interests of justice required.

The new law changes the default position so that;

* if a publisher *is* part of an approved regulator, couldn't be signed up to one, or it would be unreasonable of them to sign up, they won't pay costs *even if they lose*,

* if a publisher *isn't* part of an approved regulator, could be, and it would have been reasonable for them to be, they will pay costs even if they win.

But that's the default position. As before, the Court can (and has to) award costs differently if it is just and equitable to do so.

Again, it is hard to know whether or not this actually changes the law. The Court still has discretion and still has to award whatever costs are just and equitable. The existence of this provision may not change what is just and equitable.

What this section does, though, is encourage the formation of regulators, and encourage publishers to sign up. And it makes it a bit harder for (poorer) people to sue publishers who do sign up, and a bit easier for them to sue those that don't - although in reality it probably won't be that big a change; the main focus is on getting people to go through the regulator's arbitration service.

On how it affects Private Eye, the question becomes whether its refusal to sign up on principle is reasonable. If it is, Private Eye will be better off under the scheme.

If it isn't reasonable for Private Eye to refuse to sign up, I don't have a huge amount of sympathy for them.

&gt; Our peculiar system, with the executive and legislative branches of government rolled into one, doesn't really have many legal restrictions on it. The press is one of the few independent things left to hold government to account

I agree with he first part, disagree with the second. Over the last decade (on issues that I've been following) the press (which is hardly independent from the Government given their close ties) has, for the most part, supported the Government - it has been the judiciary remaining independent, holding the executive in check. I have more faith in them to uphold an appropriate degree of press freedom than I do the press itself.

She was eventually replaced by a new monarch of Italian origin, who ruled 1870–73, but he had little power base in Spain, and was forced to abdicate in 1873.

Following elections the following year in which anti-monarchist forces won a decisive majority, the King fled the country (presumably worried about reprisals for his role in the dictatorship), and a Republic was proclaimed.

The prime minister can be anyone, the king is by blood. This is - to put it mildly - discriminating, and must have no place in modern societies.

&gt; Every state official does not have to be elected in a democracy, as long as the people have control over how that position is appointed.

Again, judges are not elected, but they are appointed because of their credentials (they studied) and merit (they passed an examination or something). That's not the case for a king. He's a king because of an unfair privilege (or maybe you think that ""chosen by god"" is a good credential :P ).

&gt; Most people in current monarchies don't want the head of state to be politically appointed.

What the people want is not democracy. Democracy is a set of rules, and one of them is: everybody is born equal. Modern monarchies are seen as an exception to this rule, because of tradition, but for me this exception is wrong.

&gt; Monarchies aren't around because people are brainwashed traditionalists

Io in realtà ho invece visto subito la stella a fianco al fascio,e la prima cosa che mi è saltata all'occhio è stata la contraddizione. Frankenstein+Stella di David+Fascio= Contraddizione.

Questo io ho visto.

Il nasone....beh, senza offesa, ma l'ho trovato somigliante,così come la fronte alta e i capelli ricci. La caricatura tipica antisemita dà più rilevanza al naso adunco e alle mani che si sfregano come a rallegrarsi di una disgrazia altrui, dal quale la figura dell ""ebreo errante"" profitta. 

Ora mi chiedo: la stella di David può essere considerata un modo di ""deumanizzare"" la giornalista in base alla sua religione o deriva invece dal fatto che il 95% del lavoro della sig.ra riguarda Israele e il rapporto di questo paese con altri nell'ambito delle relazioni internazionali?

Nel senso.....se il suo lavoro è sempre stato concentrato su quella tematica, in una vignetta è lecito renderla riconoscibile con un simbolo legato a tale opera?La stella di David è in questo caso irrisoria o neutralmente indentificativa?

In caso contrario, bastavano i ricci biondi, gli occhi chiari e i tratti marcati per renderla identificabile nella vignetta?

I (24, student, for whatever that's worth) would happen to be one of those Germans considering third-generation Turkish-Germans to be just that, hyphenated Germans. But I do realize that it is quite common to consider them Turks (most notably among Turkish-Germans themselves), and I think there is something other than *ius sanguinis* at work here, and that is the matter of actually wanting to be German.

I'm not saying that it's entirely the Turk/ish-German/s' own fault — it is quite understandable, after all, that after being rhetorically denied Germanhood by the culture around you, the nationality is seen as sour grapes and not worth striving for anyways. Combine that with the fact that most Turkish immigrants have been coming not from urban regions, but poorer rural regions of Anatolia, people especially susceptible to Turkish nationalism and of general conservative sentiment, and you have a dream recipe for preserved foreignness.

For a long time it was a joint venture of idiocy by German-Germans and immigrants alike to consider the latter temporary guests in Germany, with Turks continuing to feel like Turks and Germans continuing to see them as foreigners. It required the least amount of effort from both sides. Which is why you will be hard pressed, according to my doubtlessly subjective experience, to find a Turkish-German today actually insisting on being considered German. The majority, I would claim, has a predominantly Turkish identity, still a consequence of the abovementioned non-policies. This is also iconically represented by the total logical trainwreck of the word ""Deutschtürke"", which would actually be a Turk of German heritage, but is used for Turkish-Germans.

So, to come to any kind of conclusion: in my opinion it is the absence of the symbolic will to identify with Germanhood that is the greatest obstacle to being seen as German.

As a native, I don't feel like ""participating"" in anything. I also hate beer, I don't eat meat, I find the German tv programme a huge steaming pile of shit; did I fail at absorbing my own culture?

Yes, in a way that is the point. The crisis was caused by a global downturn. Some countries have more robust economies, others have less robust economies. Greece's economy was so rotten that only cheap Euros could keep it afloat even during good times. It is not the fault of Germany or any other country that investors did not want to lend money to Greece anymore. It was only the fault of Greece. 

To use your example, a heroin addict is more likely to die of a cold than an athlete.

When the USSR was a super power it had incredible trade firepower, a conventional military of eye boggling firepower and a huge nuclear arsenal. All it really has left is the last bit.

A lot of this talk of out-manoeuvring is a manufactured story. Obama was derailed by the vote in the British parliament. Simply put if even we think intervention is a bad idea there must be something wrong. That is the political argument Obama would have to face. Really Russia just offered Obama an easy way to do what he wanted to do at that point. Crucially without the US losing face. It was masterful but it doesn't really say anything about Russian power.

If our parliament had voted for intervention then right now we'd be talking about the aftermath of Syria. Likely what to do with Assad being unseated as our intervention tipped the balance.

The talk of continuity is also absurd. Russia didn't seamlessly move from the USSR to Russia. It went to near collapse in the middle. For over a decade we didn't know what was going to come out of the east.

The current debate about Russian influence being pushed back to its border is telling. Russia is on the brink of losing Ukraine.

Eine Auswahl:

**Verhinderung echter Zukunftstechnologien**

Die Grünen, als überzeugte Atomkraftgegner, sind heute der Grund warum wir uns mit Entsorgungstechnologien wie dem Dual Fluid Reactor nicht beschäftigen, sprich forschen dürfen. Um ganz sicher zu gehen, dass dies so bleibt, schrieb man das sogar in das Gesetz. Damit sind die Deutschen gezwungen für Milliarden ein Endlager zu suchen und zu bauen, um dann den radioaktiven Müll auf ewig irgendwo zu versenken. 

Ein Dual Fluid Reactor würde bis zur Fertigstellung wohl nur einen Bruchteil, wir reden hier immer noch von 20 Milliarden, kosten und unsere Energie- sowie Entsorgungsprobleme für alle Zeiten kosten. Von den Vorteilen der Technologieführerschaft mal abgesehen ist dies die wesentlich bessere Alternative zur Endlagerung. Dank grüner Ideologie leider nicht in Deutschland verfügbar.

Zitat:


&gt;Es besteht dringender Handlungsbedarf; die Bundesregierung muss die Energieforschungspolitik in Deutschland neu justieren. Die vom Deutschen Bundestag fraktionsübergreifend beschlossene Abkehr von der RisikotechnologieAtomkraft erfordert auch den **Atomausstieg in der Energieforschung.**

*Hans-Josef Fell, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen*

**Nahrungsmittel zu Sprit**

Die Grünen leisteten extreme Lobbyarbeit um E10 zwangsweise einzuführen. Damit wurden ganze Ernten zur Sprit- statt zur Nahrungsmittelerzeugung genutzt, da dies dank Abnahmezwang und grüner Subventionen profitabler war. Damit stiegen natürlich die Nahrungsmittelpreise und es verhungerten daran tausende Menschen. 

Hier in Deutschland sollte natürlich der Landwirt zum neuen Ölscheich werden und baute ebenfalls fleißig an, die Preise stiegen auch hier. Zu guter Letzt fielen und fallen in Zukunft wohl tausende Tonnen Extramüll an, da E10 leider die Motoren der meisten Fahrzeuge vorzeitig zermürbt. Dank der Grünen wird der CO2 Ausstoß so sicher gesenkt.

**Energiesparlampen**

Die Grünen zwangen gemeinsam mit der Lobbyorganisation der Leuchtmittelhersteller einen Kontinent per Richtlinie auf seine Umweltschonenden Lichtgeber zu verzichten und stattdessen den absoluten Umweltkiller, quecksilberhaltige Energiesparlampen einzusetzen. Die Folge ist eine massive, nicht abschätzbare Verschmutzung der Umwelt in einem Ausmaß, welches jeglichen Rahmen sprengt. Es gab in der Menschheitsgeschichte nie einen größeren Einsatz von Quecksilber. Wer diesen hochgiftigen Stoff richtig entsorgt war den Grünen dann doch egal. Das geschieht ja in Indien. 
Dazu empfehle ich den Film Bulb Fiction. Danach mag man die Grünen gleich noch mehr.

**Sexarbeit**

Da die Grünen alles und jeden sexuell befreien müssen, schufen sie zusammen mit der SPD ein Gesetz, dass für tausende junge Osteuropäerinnen der Weg in die sexuelle Ausbeutung war und den Menschenhandel zum Zwecke dieser legalisierte. Deutschland wurde zur Drehscheibe des Sextourismus in Europa, durch die ständig fallenden Preise aufgrund des ganzen ""Frischfleischs"" wurden die Frauen zu immer mehr Freiern genötigt, die Dienste wurden durch protektionsfreien Geschlechtsverkehr verteuert, etc. Der größte Witz dieser Legalisierung ist sowieso, dass die Sexarbeiter völlig entrechtet wurden. Sie sollen zwar Steuern für ihre Ausbeutung zahlen, profitieren aber nicht von dem Schutz des Staates. Das statistische Bundesamt gab die Anzahl der sozialversicherungspflichtigen Sexarbeiter mit 44 an; darunter 4 Männer. Was mit den anderen ist? Fragen Sie das die Grünen. 

**Lobbyismus**

Die Grünen sind ein Lobbyverband, insbesondere der Energiewirtschaft:

Christine Scheel - Aufsichtsrat der HEAG Südhessische Energie AG

Marianne Tritz - Geschäftsführerin des Deutschen Zigarettenverbandes

Joschka Fischer - RWE

Margareta Wolf, Matthias Berninger, Norbert Schellberg, ... die Liste ist endlos. Und das waren nur die deutschen Abgeordneten. Wie das auf Europaeebene aussieht kann sich ja jeder selbst denken.

**Migration**

Die Grünen sperrten sich mit Händen und Füßen gegen kontrollierte Zuwanderung unter Rot-Grün. Während Vorschläge von Zuwanderungsgesetzen in der Art von Kanada oder Australien auf dem Tisch lagen, setzten sich die Grünen mit unkontrollierter Massenzuwanderung durch. In diesem Zusammenhang sei auch auf die Visa-Affäre Joschka Fischers verwiesen.

Dank der Blockadehaltung der Grünen gibt es in diesem Bereich auch keinerlei Fortschritt. Deutschland verschaffte Asylbetrügern wie Leistungserschleichern gleichermaßen ungehinderten Zugang zu den deutschen Sozialsystemen. Dass die Kommunen damit völlig überfordert sind, interessiert die Grünen nur am Rande. One World, One People und so. 
Die ausufernde Kriminalität durch Zugewanderte wird durch die Grünen vor allem mit dem Einsatz der Rassismuskeule gegen Benenner der Zustände bekämpft. Stadteile in Berlin und Bonn wurden faktisch von der Polizei aufgegeben. Dank an die Toleranzoffensive der Grünen

**Kriegspartei**

Zu den Grundsätzen der Grünen gehörte neben der sexuellen Befreiung von Kindern auch die absolute Ablehnung von Kriegseinsätzen. Das interessierte nach der Machtergreifung außer Ströbele niemanden mehr und man führte die Deutschen in den ersten völkerrechtlich völlig illegalen Angriffskrieg der Nachkriegsgeschichte und ebnete damit den Weg zu der Doktrin, Deutschland überall in der Welt verteidigen zu können. Seitdem stimmen die Grünen gegen den Willen der überwältigenden Mehrheit des Volkes jedes Jahr für eine Verlängerung der Kriegseinsätze weltweit. Auch im Syrienkonflikt forderte der bekennende Päderast Daniel Cohn-Bendit Bomben auf Damaskus.

**Überwachung und Abschaffung der Bürgerrechte**

Bei dem ganzen NSA Skandal stellt sich oft die Frage nach dem Geheimverträgen, die das ja angeblich alles ermöglichen sollen. Mitgetragen haben diese neben der Verräterpartei eben die Grünen, welche die Ottokataloge durchwinkten, den Biometrischen Pass einführten, Swift unterstüzten etc. Es ist einfach so lächerlich auf einer Freiheit statt Angst Demo auf Grüne zu treffen.

Von deren desaströsen Entscheidungen in der Eurokrise, Pädophilieskandal, Parteiskandalen, Hartz4[...] fang ich gar nicht erst an. Die Grünen sind die furchtbarste Partei nach der NSDAP, die je in Deutschland in Regierungsverantwortung saß. Die machen in Sachen Lobbyismus der FDP einen vor. Wenn die wenigstens wie die CDU offen zugeben würden gegen den Bürger zu agieren, könnte man denen ja noch nur den selben Hass entgegen bringen, wie jeder anderen Partei auch, aber wenn man sich selbst zum Heiligen, moralisch Überlegenen erklärt, dann fällt man eben besonders tief. Genau diese Heuchelei ist es, die bei mir auf so viel Ablehnung stößt. ",0,1383583746,null,0,false,0,cd6k2im,t3_1pvhaw,t1_cd6k2im,t1_cd6imgc,null,1428794426,-5,false,de,t5_22i0,-5

Of course, your own opinion is completely unbiased but the product of objective reality, right? Give me a break. I could say the same thing. This adds nothing to the discussion.

&gt; Yes, in a way that is the point. The crisis was caused by a global downturn. Some countries have more robust economies, others have less robust economies. Greece's economy was so rotten that only cheap Euros could keep it afloat even during good times. It is not the fault of Germany or any other country that investors did not want to lend money to Greece anymore. It was only the fault of Greece. 

Greece's economy was weak, there is no doubt about that, and the euro made it even weaker. That does not justify the punishing austerity measures nor does it mean the current situation is Greece's fault. You are pretending that the ""global downturn"", the construction of the eurozone etc were all like natural phenomena. The only case in which you assign agency to any entity in the whole system is Greece to blame it for its weak economy. Why?

&gt; You still did not offer an alternative. What is it? Germany's fault? USA's fault? Whos fault is it if not Greece's? 

An alternative explanation of the crisis is not simply a blame game. It doens't end by saying ""it's X's fault"". Look through my submission history if you want to read about alternative explanations, but it will take a long time. 

&gt; The point is your view is incredibly biased and one sided, to the point that it is clear that you are from Greece. 

It's funny you should say that. Most Greek redditors vehemently disagree with me. For the general population in Greece, the explanations are extremely simplistic: either ""woe is us, we are corrupt and inefficient and now we have to suffer"" or ""those blasted foreigners are taking over our country"". As for me, personally, I used to be on the ""pro-bailout"" camp only 2 years ago. 

&gt; Try to understand the other side. We try to understand you, but you have to accept your own problems, or you will never be able to make difficult changes. 

You are not trying to understand ""us"" at all. Your whole narrative with ""the difficult changes"" and so on is just paternalistic bullshit without any evidence to back it up.

2. gas can: If propery installed, they are safe. Of course not as safe as electrical, but excluding induction stoves. They have a kick ass kw/~~peseta~~ Euro relationship. With the eventual widespread of induction stoves, they should be phased out.

3. Washing Machine in the Kitchen: If you take the average square feet of an apartment in Europe vs on in the US you will see that space is at a prime, and therefore luxuries as washing rooms are unthinkable in less than 70 m^2.

6. External Lock: This is weird... how do you stop a thief from disassembling the door lock?

7. Bucket of lighters: See point 2. Wherever you are staying, the kitchen is probably dated. Most modern gas stoves have spark generators to get around this requirement.

9. Clothes Line: Dryers will drain energy like there is no tomorrow. In the US energy is quite cheap, in the rest of world this is simply not the case. The downside to being cheap... or at least cost conscious is that you have to expose your shorts to your neighbors. Besides the operational costs, dryers are very rough on clothing.

So how far exactly from Krakow do you produce your electricity at?

&gt;Heat pumps (both from soil and sun) are completely uneconomical on their own, only for about two years or so they seldom are, due to funding from European Union. 

Apparently they are already cheaper in Finland that any other method. Might have something to do with the weather, though.

&gt;The table is for price without tax.

In that case we should have the same prices as Norway and Sweden. Weird table. 

&gt;So a large consumer can buy a shitload of shares, then ""sell"" them for current price, effectively getting electricity at company's cost?

Pretty much, yeah. It has been suggested this is against EU-directives, but as it profits big corporations and the government's have been rather right wing, it hasn't been inspected even though Green politicians try to keep it on the table.

&gt;Are you sure it works that way?

Well, according to wikipedia; Mankala-principle of operation is when smaller electricity users set up jointly a non-profit limited liability company for power plant construction and operation purposes. Partners fund the construction and maintenance and they can buy electricity from the plant without profit margin.

This practice is legal because the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC) approved two rulings in 1963 and 1968. One of the rulings concerning the Mankala Oy Ab, and due to this approach came to be called Mankala principle.

I don't think cuts has much to do with it: even post-Agenda-2010 Germany has a larger and more generous welfare system than Greece has.

Greece has lots of problems, but I don't think the welfare state is part of them, and I don't see a need for some kind of ridiculous Thatcherism as a solution.

WTF?

You try to validate your arguments with Marxist ideology. From then on any discussion about economic strategies is pointless.

The views I expressed are not just my views, or the views of the author of the article, it is the view of the rest of Europe and the World. Greece failed because of Greece and not the Euro, not because of the international community forcing strict reforms.

We can see that these reforms were hard, but they were long over due. That is where I try to see your point of view. Now try to see my point of view: these same reforms have saved the UK economy in the same crisis, and the Spanish, and Irish, and Portuguese. We could have let you do it slower, but why? German pensioners cant afford heating but we should pay for your retirement at 50?

You offer better explanation or solution. If you have a point to make make it here. You never clarified or expanded your original statements that the article is wrong because it attaches blame to Greece. All of Europe believes today it was wrong to let you join.

You have not offered shadow of an argument to show that it was ""mostly"" not the fault of Greece.  

Global slow downs ARE natural phenomenons, and countries should expect them. The Euro made Greece more prosperus than  
it has been for the last 2000 years, and you blame the Euro for your problems. And then expect other countries to pay for your marxist policies.

Mais c'est déjà le cas. Les skins ne montent plus dans les cars du FN. Et on peut citer de nombreux cas où le service d'ordre du FN a du se battre contre des skins qui tentaient d'infiltrer le cortège (de mémoire en 1990 et 1993). La branche catho a toujours considéré ces mecs comme des marginaux attardés, et la plupart des skins (à part ceux de Ayoub) a été largement hostile à Marine Le Pen.

&gt;Et quand JM LePen reviendra sur ses propos négationistes.

L'affaire du détail est expliquée [ici](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgzYb8Avohk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=7m15s). D'autre part, pour Le Pen père, la France n'est pas concernée par les chambres à gaz. 24 000 Français juifs y sont morts (dont 7000 enfants d'étrangers). Il appelle donc, de manière provocante, les chambres à gaz un détail de l'histoire. Je ne pense pas que ça changera.

&gt;Le FN au mieux garde le flou pour garder les votes.

Pour moi c'est très clair au contraire. Pas de skins au FN, pas d'identitaires sur les listes.

&gt;Déclarez morte la ligne ""anti Islam"" comme tu l'appelle. Ne soutenez plus leur membres.

Ça, ce sont des luttes internes. Marine Le Pen a encore moins de convictions politiques que son père, c'est dire. Elle ira où les votes et les caméras seront. 

Si on se tape à nouveau un Merah, c'est sûr que la ligne anti-Islam reprendra. Si la ""droite forte"" est de nouveau médiatisée, c'est sûr que cette ligne reprendra. Si les médias arrêtent de parler du FN, c'est sûr qu'on aura une provocation pour refaire la une comme à chaque fois.

Soyons directs, sans voiture ce n'est même pas la peine d'y penser. Trop long, trop cher, trop épuisant pour pouvoir profiter du ski. 
La seule solution : trouver d'autres gus toujours motivés pour partir (genre moi :D) dans une voiture, le plus nombreux possible (3/4 minimum). A 4 et avec un conducteur qui connaît la route pour pas trop cher le voyage est clairement rentable. 

Ensuite le mieux c'est de filer vers le Grand Bornand, station la plus proche de Paris, 5h30 de route et pas les 7/8h habituelles pour aller en station avec l'avantage de pas être trop chère à la journée, avec des réducs étudiantes. 
Enfin pour le logement, repérer avant une auberge de jeunesse (c'est pas ce qui manque dans le coin) afin de pouvoir transiter vite et sans se ruiner, voire se renseigner pour des logements chez l'habitant (beaucoup moins cher que les auberges). 

Si tu veux plus de détails on est un groupe de 3 gus supermotivés pour skier tout le temps et il reste une place dans notre voiture pour les voyages, alors si ça te dit envoie moi un MP et je te donnerai les détails de comment on fait et tu verras si tu trouves ça intéressant/abordable au niveau du prix. 

(je n'ai pas abordé le point matos mais il est clair qu'il vaut mieux avoir le sien pour réduire les frais)

Enfin pour finir, le meilleur site pour programmer ça reste de loin : skipass.com, section forums et ensuite dans le BlaBla ou les annonces de covoit' il y a beaucoup de parisiens qui partent skier tout le temps et avec qui on peut se joindre. 

En tous cas, c'est vraiiiiiment pas tant la mort que ça de partir skier !

Spanish people have the ""why is there no fiesta(literally have heard that question)"" attitude.

Being friendly and family matters. Spanish people just seem so much more friendly and care so much more about their family. Maybe your girlfriend had an exceptional family which I'm happy to hear but most families these days are so split and always in conflict. Also Italians seem to have more of an ""mind your own business attitude"". You have no idea how long it's been since I last had a big family get together.

The people kind of look different. I don't mean physically but more of what everyone looks concerned with.

The fact that languages are close goes without saying, but the way I see it there are more different things than alike. Same goes for Greek people who have tried to convince me that we are basically the same people.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; You try to validate your arguments with Marxist ideology.

First of all, nothing I presented above is Marxist ideology. Second, even if it was, what would the problem be? 

&gt; The views I expressed are not just my views, or the views of the author of the article, it is the view of the rest of Europe and the World.

While it is true that neoliberalism has become extremely mainstream in the past few decades, that does not make it the objective truth by a long shot. Argumentum ad populum and so on.

&gt; Greece failed because of Greece and not the Euro, not because of the international community forcing strict reforms.

Greece failed because of a multitude of factors, both endemic and external to Greece. You keep trying to assign blame as if Greece is a person, which is pretty annoying and ridiculous. 

&gt; We can see that these reforms were hard, but they were long over due. That is where I try to see your point of view.

Your effort to understand my point of view is repeating your own point of view? Okay then...

&gt;  these same reforms have saved the UK economy in the same crisis, and the Spanish, and Irish, and Portuguese. 

You know the UK did some mild austerity and a lot of money printing, right? You also know that the Spanish, Irish and Portuguese economies are in terrible condition, right? While you are correct that they are not as bad as Greece, that does not mean that they are recovering. Especially the Spanish and the Portuguese. 

&gt; German pensioners cant afford heating but we should pay for your retirement at 50?

False dilemma. The money doesn't need to come from German pensioners. If anything, the Germans should rise against their government and stop their tax money being used to save bankrupted banks and their wages getting lowered for the sake of profitability. Also, I would appreciate it if you stopped repeating the old myth of Greeks retiring at 50. 

&gt; You offer better explanation or solution. If you have a point to make make it here. You never clarified or expanded your original statements that the article is wrong because it attaches blame to Greece. 

I told you it's a complicated situation and you can look through my submission history if you're interested. But since you're so eager and insist so much, here's some articles and lectures you might find interesting:

&gt; You have not offered shadow of an argument to show that it was ""mostly"" not the fault of Greece. 

It was not my intention to prove that in the first place. I felt the article was one-sided because it only presented reasons internal to Greece as factors contributing to the crisis. Having observed that, I made a note of it. 

If I absolutely had to play this ridiculous blame game you keep insisting on, I would assign 30% of the blame to Greece's political elite (for entering the Eurozone even though Greece's economy would not be able to compete), 30% to the people who designed the Eurozone (for thinking it possible to create a monetary union without any fiscal transfers) and 40% to the highly financialised version of the capitalist system (which contributed to the current global crisis). But this is all grossly oversimplified: You can't really understand a financial crisis by producing a mixture of blame portions for each relevant institution.

&gt; All of Europe believes today it was wrong to let you join.

If one assumes that the countries comprising the Eurozone should be equally competitive, then of course it was wrong to let Greece in. But the same is true (to a lesser degree) about almost every other country in the Eurozone, with the exception of Germany, Finland and maybe the Netherlands and France. 

&gt; Global slow downs ARE natural phenomenons

What's so natural about it? The world economy has the same productive capacity as it did a few years ago, but somehow we managed to get a lot of people to lower their standard of living. 

&gt; The Euro made Greece more prosperus than it has been for the last 2000 years, and you blame the Euro for your problems.

By turning it into a financial bubble? Thanks, I guess. 

&gt; And then expect other countries to pay for your marxist policies.

Haha. Okay now, don't be ridiculous. 

&gt; WHY IS IT NOT GREECE'S FAULT THAN THEY RUN OUT OF MONEY?

If each country has its own currency, then none of them can really run out of money. The exchange rates reflect the strength of their economies. Without exchange rates, the difference in competitiveness becomes a budget deficit and without fiscal transfers or its own currency, the weakest links run into debt problems.
