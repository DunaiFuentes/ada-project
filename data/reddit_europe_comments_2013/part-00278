D'ailleurs, interdire la critique d'une société extérieure à la sienne présuppose qu'elle est un organisme fermé dans le temps et dans l'espace.

&gt; Donne moi un seul exemple de relativiste qui n'a pas fait d'autocritique.

Pour la n-ième fois, le relativisme est philosophiquement faux parce qu'il interdit l'autocritique alors que les relativistes la pratiquent. Je te demandais un contre-exemple où un système générant lui-même sa morale et sa loi ne s'imposte pas un conformisme absolu et l'interdiction de l'autocritique. Le contrat social de Rousseau a demandé à celui-ci qu'il fasse un raisonnement cartésien en dehors de sa propre civilisation. Le relativisme culturel est incompatible avec le raisonnement cartésien en ce qu'il fonde tout raisonnement dans la culture, et non dans la nature.

I think you also have less freedom to decide what you want to do, but I'm not sure about this.

Because let's face it, it's the media that shape public opinion and when all the media like to report on is ""lol we saw a horse on a road in X country in east europe. Who uses horses today lololol!"" and so on, this image issue will never go away.

Yes, countries in EE are poorer, and poorer people leads to higher crime and corruption rates (everywhere in the world), but the people as a whole aren't ""lesser"" in any way, and understandably many are quite upset to see their countries and cultures effectively pissed on by western media again and again, mocked and accused of every bad and questionable thing under the sun.",0,1387687716,null,0,false,0,ce7irpg,t3_1tfhnl,t1_ce7irpg,t3_1tfhnl,null,1428033471,27,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,27

Don't get a boner! ;)

Follow your friends lead, but here is what it is like:

Bring a robe, a (long!) towel to sit on in the sauna, a towel to dry after showering, shower gel and shampoo.

You disrobe, put your stuff into a locker, put on your robe and take the two towels and the gel / shampoo with you. You go to the shower area, and clean yourself. You leave your gel/shampoo there. Get dry and hang up your drying towel to dry. You enter the sauna dry.

Hang your robe on a hook near the sauna door and get inside. Do not leave the door open. You sit/lay down on your second towel, not on the wooden benches. The higher the bench, the hotter the air, so try the lowest first. Laying down flat is best because your head and feet and in the same temperature zone. Relax, breath, talking is frowned upon, except a greeting when you enter. When more people enter and space get scarce, switch to seating if you were laying down.

Once a hour, there is a ""Aufguss"". The sauna master will pour scented water over the hot stones, creating steam and he will distribute it with a towel. If these swats of hot air are too much for you, just signal with your hand and he will omit you. 

One round is about 10-15 minutes (there are hourglasses), but do not overextend yourself, do not feel the need to proof yourself. If feel too uncomfortable, it is time to leave. If you were laying down, do not jump up, it may crash your blood pressure. Slowly sit up first, stay that way for a minute, then stand up and exit.

Outside, breath a bit of fresh air if possible, take a minute, then go to the showers. There is a cold water hose. Use it to cool down, going from the outside (feet then legs then hands then arms) to the core (and thous the heart). Then you can do a bit of hot shower / cold shower cycles, ending with hot. If they have a small cold water bath, you can try it. Just get inside, immerge yourself shortly, get out, hot shower.
 
Dry yourself, put on your robe and lay out your towels to dry. If you want and they offer it, you can take a hot foot bath now. There is usually some kind of tea room where you can can have a tea and chat with your friends. There might also be a quiet room, where you can lay back and relax for a bit. No talking obviously.

Now, about an hour has passed since you started, and it is time for the next cycle. No showering, just get into the sauna again. This repeats for 3-4 times.

Before you leave, you shower again and wash with gel/shampoo, collect your stuff and get to the lockers to dress.

Most Germans I've met here (tourist-wise, obviously not the immigrants) seem to know us apart from Americans very well which makes me happy. One German I chatted with a year or so ago told me that if I approached him asking for directions and said ""I'm American"" he would've given me directions and had no interest in conversing. He said if I said ""I'm Canadian"" he would've wanted to go get a beer. This was very welcoming and heartwarming to hear. :)


Yes, there's many here with German family and ancestry (self included as mentioned).  I've also read many times about the Aussie/DE connections. One time my friends uncle was refused service in Florida in a restaurant because he was asked where he was from and when he answered Germany they told him that they refused to serve his ""kind.""

La dice lunga su una ricchezza sociale che anche in tempi come questi continua ad esistere ma si concentra nelle mani di pochi. Insomma, non siamo tutti sulla stessa barca.
Oggi a Firenze migliaia di persone non riescono ad arrivare alla fine del mese. Circa 100 sfratti con la forza pubblica sono previsti ogni mese. Con il ricatto della disoccupazione le condizioni di lavoro peggiorano ovunque verso forme più pesanti di sfruttamento e precarietà. Dai prezzi nei supermercati ai canoni di affitto passando per le bollette, il costo della vita si fa sempre più insostenibile. Questa è la Firenze che viviamo tutti i giorni. Esiste un altra Firenze, invece, fatta boutique di lusso e ristoranti di classe.
E' la città-vetrina del centro storico, la cui bellezza è stata da tempo espropriata ai propri abitanti per venderla a turisti e businessman locali che l'hanno trasformata nel loro salotto esclusivo. E' la città in cui si comprano e vendono capi di abbigliamento dal valore superiore ad uno stipendio comune. Qui la crisi non esiste, se non come opportunità di nuove speculazioni e nuovi profitti. Con l'avvicinarsi del Natale la Firenze del lusso si prepara a vivere i suoi giorni migliori di shopping e turismo (e quindi di guadagni).
Per quei giorni, precisamente per sabato 21 dicembre, vogliamo costruire una mobilitazione generale che riporti in piazza la rabbia di tutti quelli che oggi subiscono la crisi e le politiche di austerità: la rabbia di chi subisce uno sfratto, la rabbia dei lavoratori che subiscono le ristrutturazioni aziendali, la rabbia dei precari che passano da un lavoro di m**** a un altro, la rabbia di chi vede una parte importante del proprio salario rapinato dalle aziende di trasporto (... e per un servizio scadente), la rabbia dei migranti stanchi di vivere con il ricatto del rinnovo dei documenti, la rabbia dei rifugiati trattati come cani dalle istituzioni.

Das ist Putin mit einer korrupten Elite, die sich mächtig bedient am Reichtum. Und Chodorkowski war Teil dieser Elite. Er ist deshalb ins Gefängnis gekommen, weil er, im Gegensatz zum Rest dieses neuen Geldadels, aufbegehrt hat. Also nicht nach Putins Pfeife getanzt ist. Er hat alles riskiert und alles verloren. Im Zweifel für Russland. Denn wenn er stillgehalten hätte, wie die anderen Oligarchen, dann hätte er alle behalten können.

Agreed.

The crucial feature of indirect democracy is the perception of representation, the collective trust in shared aims and expectations that allows the people to put their destiny in the hands of another, safe in the knowledge that even if ‘their’ man doesn’t get the job then the other guy will still be looking after their best interests.

The manner in which this trust is built is the knowledge that you and ‘he’ have a history of cooperation, and that your respective families likewise have a shared social and cultural history of cooperation, all of which allows you to trust that when adversity strikes ‘he’ will act in a predictable and acceptable way.

Le mot discrimination est souvent utilisé pour les discriminations raciales, mais il est important de souligner et de dénoncer toutes les discriminations et pas seulement les discriminations raciales. Quand je disais qu'elle supporte un mode de vie et des principes discriminatoires, je parle effectivement du voile, qui montre qu'elle applique une tradition religieuse discriminant les femmes mais aussi de son projet de gym qui discrimine aussi les femmes.  
On entend jamais les choses dans ce sens là, parce que dire à quelqu'un de confession musulmane qu'il soutient des discriminations parce qu'il soutient ces principes de séparations hommes/femmes, c'est juste pas politiquement correct alors que c'est la définition même de discrimination. Y a beaucoup de gens qui aiment utiliser le mot discrimination mais seulement quand ça les arrangent, c'est très dommage.


Prends ces deux phrases:


une religion qui incite le port du voile pour les femmes mais pas pour les hommes.  
une personne qui ouvre une piscine interdite aux hommes et réservée aux femmes.


et tu remplaces la séparation homme/femme par blanc/noir, juif/non-juif, nain/personne de taille normale... tout de suite les gens vont crier à la discrimination. Mais là non alors que c'est la même chose. Il y a discrimination dès qu'il y a séparation par définition, ça fait grincer des dents mais y a pas de débat.

Et un petit extrait de la [page wikipedia sur l'affaire du voile islamique en France](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaires_du_voile_islamique_en_France#Recommandation_des_commissions_ad_hoc) :

&gt;Dans sa résolution 1743 (2010)21 point 14, le Conseil de l'Europe relève : « Rappelant sa Résolution 1464 (2005) sur les femmes et la religion en Europe, l’Assemblée invite l’ensemble des communautés musulmanes à abandonner toute interprétation traditionnelle de l’islam qui nie l’égalité entre hommes et femmes, et restreint les droits des femmes, à la fois au sein de la famille et dans la vie publique. Cette interprétation n’est pas compatible avec la dignité humaine et les normes démocratiques; les femmes sont égales en tout aux hommes et doivent être traitées en conséquence, sans exception. **La discrimination envers les femmes, qu’elle soit fondée sur des traditions religieuses ou non, est contraire aux articles 8, 9 et 14 de la Convention, à l’article 5 de son Protocole nº 7, ainsi qu’à son Protocole nº 12. Aucun relativisme religieux ou culturel ne saurait être invoqué pour justifier des violations de la personne humaine.** »  



edit :  
Je tiens juste à rajouter qu'étant moi même victime de discrimination régulièrement, je prends ça très très au sérieux. Les valeurs d'égalité entre les personnes doivent être respectées et toutes les personnes qui soutiennent des discriminations doivent être combattues systématiquement, beaucoup de gens se sont battus avant nous pour que ces valeurs soient reconnues et respectées par des lois. Et il n'y a rien de pire que des gens comme cette femme qui utilisent la carte discrimination dès qu'on leur interdit quelque chose, alors que ce qu'on lui interdit ici c'est justement de discriminer! C'est de l'hypocrisie totale, elle est en pleine contradiction avec elle-même et elle ne s'en rend même pas compte.  
Bref, **si vous downvotez, merci au moins de vous expliquer**. Je comprends que pour beaucoup, l'idée qu'une musulmane qui porte plainte pour discrimination serait en fait la personne qui discrimine ça provoque un ""divide by zero"" mais c'est pourtant ce qui ce passe par définition même, ça arrive très souvent et notamment lors des affaires de port de voile, où énormément de personnes musulmanes s'expriment et crient à la discrimination car on leur interdit le port d'un objet issue d'une tradition discriminatoire. Et personne dans les médias ne relève cette contradiction, car ce n'est juste pas politiquement correct de critiquer une religion. Je n'ai rien contre la religion musulmane particulièrement, la religion musulmane n'est pas discriminatoire en soit, certaines traditions archaïques de la religion musulmane le sont et elles n'ont pas lieu d'être dans une société moderne égalitaire.

La West Coast è come una chimera, puoi andarci perchè per anni ti sei bevuto che HOllywood è il paradiso in terra, che Los Angeles è la terra dei sogni; eventualmente è solo specchietti per allodole. Molte persone che conosco hanno trovato San Franciso molto superiore alla California del sud.
Dipende dalle aspettative che uno ha. Se preferisci assaporare l'America vera, allora la trovi tra Boston e Philadelphia; se invece vuoi andare ad ovest bisogna aspettarsi un ambiente molto meno culturale e storico; se poi la destinazione è un università o college in California e ci si accontenta delle spiagge, allora va più che bene.

Il Canada, invece, è un paese molto progressivo e moderno; l'inglese parlato è leggermente diverso da quello americano dal punto di vista della pronuncia, e ci sono destinazioni più ""europee"" come Montreal oppure Quebec City.

Dal mio punto di vista se si vuole imparare l'inglese non c'è bisogno di andare in nord America; basta andare in Inghilterra o Irlanda ed assimili una pronuncia più corretta con la fonetica giusta. Stando nel regno unito o Irlanda si è nella comunità europea e dal punto di vista burocratico le cose sono molto più facili.

Firstly, bureaucracy. Make sure you register your status as a Freiberufler with the Finanzamt in the city you live in. This means that you are essentially self employed and are therefore responsible for paying your own taxes and healthcare, and other social insurance costs. 

Secondly, get a tax consultant and save every single receipt you can. They'll usually cost around €1000 but it is so worth it for the money you can save, and also  relieves you of the stress and hassle of the German tax system.

Thirdly, healthcare. Since 2009 everyone living in Germany MUST have health insurance. Most Germans are covered through their work, in which both they and their employers pay into the state insurance scheme. This is not an option for you as a freelancer, you MUST insure yourself privately and this can be very, very expensive. For example,  I'm 25, asthmatic and somewhat on the larger side, this lead to me getting quotes of between €500 and €3000 per month. Luckily I've been able to get insurance with a British company registered in Germany and only pay €130 a month. Some of my colleagues pay only €70.

Fourthly, wages and work patterns. The going hourly rate in Germany is around €20 - €25 per hour (usually 45 mins) This may sound a lot but you need to remember this covers preparation, materials, travel and teaching time. Once your tax, healthcare and other social security bills have been deducted you really wont be earning a great deal, unless you have a shit ton of hours lined up. Of course the hours you can can be extremely fickle, one month you could be working your tits off and then spend the next two months rummaging through bins looking for bottles to pay your rent with.  

It is of course an extremely rewarding job, and you'll meet lots of really interesting people on a daily basis. Also if you're not too worried about things such as taxes and healthcare you can always do what a lot of freelancers do and take the risk and not pay ...

Oh boy, did we go full retard this week...

* The Supreme Court has ruled that foreign currency loans, in which the loanee receives the loan in Forints, but make the payment in the selected foreign currency, are legal and [the contracts are binding and valid](http://www.politics.hu/20131216/top-court-rules-fx-lending-not-against-law/) and they did not nullify them. Since hundreds of thousands of ~~idiots~~ *victims* are now paying nearly double payments on their CHF loans and some are losing/already lost their homes, naturally the Supreme Court was called a bunch of nation-hating traitors for daring to acknowledge that the contracts were in accordance with the law, which is their one and only role. About 4-5 years ago many people opted for CHF-based loans, when the exchange rate was around 145-160HUF/CHF, now it is 235, down from the record 260 region. More bitching by various actors: [1](http://www.politics.hu/20131220/parliamentary-speaker-calls-kuria-ruling-on-forex-loans-cowardly/), [2](http://www.politics.hu/20131221/protesters-against-kuria-fx-loan-ruling-submit-petitions/), [3](http://www.politics.hu/20131220/orban-says-top-court-sides-with-banks/)

* The decision was unexpectedly straightforward and surprised the politicians. Both Orbán and formed Finance Minister, now-President of the National Bank Matolcsy expressed their dissatisfaction with the decision, because it's ""hurting the people"" and so did every other [major right-wing player](http://www.politics.hu/20131217/jobbik-calls-kuria-fx-loans-decision-shame-of-govt/). I guess compared to the discounted holidays to Spain and huge LCD TVs purchased by the then very cheap loans it is hurting, but people gambled and then lost. Being an idiot is no excuse for that.

* Matolcsy, already famed for his stupidity lauded the government efforts to heavily tax foreign banks and he says that maybe 4 of the 8 big international banks might leave Hungary in the coming years. And that's apparently a great thing. Because Hungarian banks will be formed to fill their place. Right now we have a few minor Hungarian banks with minuscule clientele aside the largest player on the market, OTP. The second largest Hungarian bank, owned by the richest guy in the country is gathering clients by their super low fees: achieved by not having branches and operating predominantly online and via call centres. Yeah, those kind of guys will surely found 4 new banks, [Gyuri](http://static.168ora.hu/db/0A/F1/matolcsy-700-d0001BAF186193198ac16.jpg). 

* The nation truly shattered when the Christmas lineup of the big TV-channels were released. We won't get to see basic staples like Home Alone, Sas-cabaret (by a very untalented, Benny Hill meets Jon Stewart kind of humorist, named József Sas) or, the biggest catastrophe: Bud Spencer movies! Watching these movies on Christmas while being nearly comatose from all the food has been a tradition for many for the past 15 years. By the way, others please do tell: is the Bud Spencer movie marathon on and around Christmas a thing for you as well or we're the only weirdos like that?

* Orbán is practicing to be the lovechild of Lukashenko and Kim Jong-Un and the goverment announced plans for state monopoly in the following fields: [textbooks](http://www.politics.hu/20131217/state-to-be-sole-supplier-of-school-textbooks-from-january/) (printing, writing, etc.), all engineering projects involving state or EU funds (aka. every single project in the past 5 years), private language education, including one-on-one tutors and the [""nationalization"" of the City Park](http://www.politics.hu/20131217/fidesz-nationalizes-city-park-in-budapest/) of Budapest. All caused a huge uproar, but hopefully they'll be toned down in time, for now they are mostly just plans.

* A non-profit NGO's director was caught on film using their ambulance to get to work regularly during peak hours. Later financial discrepancies were uncovered about the organization, who already had a pretty shady reputation to anyone who paid attention, but nevertheless collected large amounts of direct and tax-deduct donations due to their aggressive marketing campaigns and their focus, child cancer. 

* Orbán visited Turkey and somehow managed to get done something that is actually good for us: [visa-free travel](http://www.politics.hu/20131219/turkey-scraps-visa-requirement-for-hungary/). Until now we were ones of the very few EU-countries that needed to pay for the visa to Turkey, along with countries like the Dominican Republic, Kazakhstan and such.

* New coach for the national football team. After vowing and failing to sign a big (and later small) international name, they settled for a Hungarian guy who've failed before. But we are crossing our fingers that we'll qualify for the next Euro Champs to France as now 24 instead of 16 teams will be there and we are still in denial that we can be so bad that we won't even reach that. 

* The VAT scandal whistleblower now has more suits going on against him than dealing with the scandal itself. [They searched his home](http://www.politics.hu/20131219/police-search-former-tax-office-staffers-home-take-records/), confiscated evidence he collected while he was working for the tax authority. Even if anything will happen about the scandal itself, the government is ridiculously buying time with this charade so the affected companies can clean up their messes.

* Good old Slovak-bashing happened as well, as Hedvig Malina, an ethnic Hungarian from Southern Slovakia moved to Hungary claiming harrassment from Slovak police after her 2006 case, in which she claimed [she was beaten by two skinheads for being Hungarian](http://www.politics.hu/20131220/ethnic-hungarian-in-slovakia-granted-asylum-says-deputy-pm/). The case was never really settled, evidence points to all directions, she may have bended the truth but police negligence and harassment are also evidence.

1. Non è vero che il nuovo meccanismo è a rischio di effetto domino, è vero il contrario. Con il sistema precedente, il peso del fallimento di una banca veniva sostenuto dal solo stato dove quella banca risiedeva; per gli stati più piccoli o più in difficoltà, questo significava spesso uno sforzo superiore alle proprie possibilità finanziarie; lo stato stesso rischiava il fallimento e doveva essere aiutato, con ripercussioni su tutto il continente. Il nuovo meccanismo, invece, tampona il fallimento di una qualsiasi banca europea grazie a un fondo pan-europeo, di modo che il colpo sia distribuito e non localizzato.

2. E' assolutamente falso che il nuovo accordo elimini la garanzia statale sui depositi bancari. La garanzia rimane esattamente quella di prima: sono coperti i depositi fino a 100.000€ per correntista per istituto.

3. Non è affatto vero che il nuovo meccanismo renda artificialmente meno sicure le banche più piccole, è vero il contrario, proprio per le ragioni spiegate al punto 1.

4. Infine, è ridicolo affermare che questo sia un accordo disegnato con l'intento occulto di favorire le banche tedesche.

You might feel you can justify it, you might even argue that it is a necessity that justifies itself as Eric Hobsbawm might have argued (who President Martin Schulz identifies as his influence and inspiration), you might even rationalise it as not being as extreme as it could be, but let's get something straight:

You are the authoritarian here.      
You are the one backing authoritarianism, here and elsewhere.    

If that's how you feel, then fine.  But that up there in the post before is most definitely examples of EU authoritarianism.

The guy who is in line to be the next president of the commission, the current president of the parliament, is eulogising a Stalin apologist widely recognised as providing revisionist history (something he himself touched on).  A man who argued that the ends justify the means when it comes to political projects.   Sound familiar?  

      
       ""Eric Hobsbawm was a man of extraordinary qualities. 
        His books have greatly inspired and influenced my 
        political and historical thoughts.""


That's the insidious nature of the organisation you plumped down on 5 years ago and decided was your flavour.  The double standard here is that if he were reading an apologist for Mein Kampf with a goofy grin there'd be hell to pay - and rightly so.  The leader of the S&amp;D is Hobsbawm fueled.

It's not a *'peculiarity of idealistic perception'*, as you put it, the EU project is clearly authoritarian in nature, and if you've not looked in a mirror recently do so, because it is turning you into one too!!!

true,Britzer,null,null,"The nuances of statistics is lost on many people. When a man comes up to me and I treat him different (in a personal setting) than the woman that came before him, that is straight sexism. 

If an insurance corporation has a million customers and sets up risk groups, that is not directly racist. But then they have personal customer interaction. Where a person makes an individual contract with the company and gets discriminated against on an individual basis. That is straight discrimination. If you walk into an insurance brokers office, don't you think it is unfair if they would turn you down, because of your skin color or sex? If they were to refuse business?

Same with the police force. If they find statistical advantages in large numbers, that is one thing. If they then turn around and check upon you, because of your skin color in a personal interaction with a police officer. That is racist.

But there is more. Since the significance of large numbers and how statistics works is lost on most people, they stop caring about suspicious behaviour and start only checking blacks. Or only discriminating agaist certain groups. And not take other factors into consideration.

Also the disadvantages of racist attitudes carry a lot longer tail than simple statistics. It is about minorities and their standing. And mobs going around. And feeling safe in certain places. Let me put it this way: If a black guy in Germany doesn't feel safe in white neighborhoods, because of racism, where can he go? If a white guy feels unsafe in black neighborhoods, where can he go? Racism and sexism and other forms of xenophobia are ubiquitous, but the effects are very different based on situation. If you are a men working in a male work environment with a single woman, and she hits you on the butt, it might be very sexist, but if the majority of men are sexist towards the single female it is a different issue.

Die derzeitige dauer, dass 1 inverstierter Euro wieder in die Kassen der Telekom fließt, liegt bei 11 jahren für normale ADSL/VDSL anschlüsse, 9 Jahre bei Vectoring DSL.

Das ist das Hauptproblem. Investition ist nicht lukrativ. Lukrativ ist, Inhalte dazu zu geben, zu dem was man schon hat (Entertain/Cloud Services/HD abbos....).

Kläglich aufbauend auf Hanna Arendts lesenswerter Theorie des Totalitarismus ist der heutige Extremismusdiskurs sehr verkürzt und sachlich falsch. Es werden hier Äpfel mit Birnen verglichen. Man kann mit guten Argumenten begründen, dass man den NS und die DDR beide gleichermaßen ablehnt, aber das macht sie nicht vergleichbar. Strukturell und ideologisch haben sie keine Gemeinsamkeiten, ausser dass sie von der Mehrheit der Bevölkerung als ""undemokratisch"" empfunden werden - wobei häufig eine Definition des jeweiligen Demokratieverständnisses fehlt.


Faschismus - der sich einer abschließenden Definition verschließt - kann nicht links sein. Er ist genuin reaktionär, da er hinter die Werte der französischen Revolution zurückfällt. Man kann ins Feld führen, dass es Leute gibt, die sich als ""links"" bezeichnen und zu entprechenden Events Randale machen. Das macht sie aber nicht zu Faschisten.


Solange jedoch alles und alle die von der politischen Kultur zu sehr abweichen als ""faschistisch"" bezeichnet werden, wird der Begriff inflationär verwendet und letztendlich als verwässerter Hülsenbegriff verkommen. Angesichts der beispiellosen Opferzahlen und der Grausamkeit des Faschismus sollte dies jedoch nicht passieren dürfen!

Alors là c'est formidable. L'analogie des trains illustre exactement ce que j'ai dit : chaque civilisation est un train fermé, et la pensée de Lévi-Strauss empêche de sauter du train ni même en sortir sa tête et de le contempler avec du recul. D'où l'impossibilité de l'autocritique selon sa logique (encore une fois, SELON sa logique, mais il se contredit et se permet l'autocritique). De ce point de vue, Lévi-Strauss n'est pas loin de la psychorigidité de Gobineau (EVIDEMMENT ses idées sont diamétralement opposées, mais le schéma de pensée est tout aussi réducteur – peut être pas tout aussi, Lévi-Strauss étant un humaniste remarquable, mais pas loin). 

Peut-être as-tu déjà lu Todorov ? Sinon, ça pourrait t'aider à avoir un regard un peu plus critique sur Lévi-Strauss.

&gt; le relativisme n'interdit pas l'autocritique *puisque* les relativistes la pratiquent.

Excuse-moi, mais si tu permets, c'est encore un faux raisonnement. Tu es entrain de dire qu'une idée émane des actions (ou d'un discours) de son penseur. Non seulement c'est en général dans le sens inverse puisque les actions et les discours émanent d'une idée, mais en plus, si l'on veut être rigoureux, ils sont complètement séparés, et s'ils s'influencent, ne sont pas strictement liés par des relations de cause à effet. 

Tu réfutes la possibilité d'une certaine contradiction dans la pensée de Lévi-Strauss en niant que l'ethnologue puisse avoir des pensées contradictoires, alors que je te demande me prouver que les dites pensées ne sont pas contradictoires. C'est comme si quelqu'un disait quelque chose, que moi j'entendais ""je n'aime pas le chocolat"", que toi tu entendais ""j'aime le chocolat"",  puis cette personne mange du chocolat, et quand je te demande comment peux-tu être sûr qu'il a dit ""j'aime le chocolat"", tu me réponds ""parce qu'il dit toujours la vérité"".

&gt; Tous les systèmes génèrent eux-mêmes leur morale et leur loi, et aucun ne s'impose une interdiction de l'autocritique. Toute société est un contre-exemple.

Faux, faux et archi-faux. Si les organisations humaines généraient exclusivement eux-même leur loi, alors la démocratie serait impossible, puisqu'elle ne va pas de soi. Elle nécessite de de se mettre en dehors d'une société non-démocratique. Si une société génère ses lois et sa morale, alors ces dernières la définissent, et l'autocritique nécessite de s'attaquer à cette définition, ce qui serait impossible si on ne sortait pas de cette définition.

The prime minister has stepped down after the tragedy last month at the Zolitude Maxima supermarket, where 54 people died. However, he is still technically the prime minister, so it makes for a funny situation, where one news article refers to him as the ""recently stepped-down prime minister"" and another says ""the official consulted prime minister Dombrovskis""...

In more depressing news, a bunch of oligarchs from the ""old guard"" have used this opportunity to lean both on the President, who is a bumbling geriatric homos sovieticus, and the weak, anemic head of the anti-corruption bureau. The President has so far been making all sorts of silly proclamations about his favorites for the office of Prime Minister (because it is the President who ""puts forward"" the candidate, officially, for consideration by Parliament, and can therefore veto any candidates the parties put forward), and just yesterday the head of the anti-corruption bureau let go a long-time corruption fighter, who had been doing good work going after corrupt big fish for 10 years. Shithead.

So a lot of commentators are calling this the revanche of the oligarchs, because they were thrown out of power after the last president initiated a referendum on whether to dissolve the last parliament(and the people voted yes). 

Parliamentary elections next October.

I can't speak much on the economics, but from January 1st we're going to have the euro. No big surprise, then, that after the heavy lifting has been done by the Dombrovskis government(s) over the last 4 years, the budget cuts and austerity measures and social balancing act, that some corrupt old schemers will jump at the chance to get in power.

If they succeed in outmaneuvering the reformists and transparent government/rule of law crowd, expect 4-5 years of economic stagnation, corruption, weak state institutions, etc.

Near Hamm you have the Rhine-Ruhr area, one of the most densely populated regions in Europe. In the past the region was pretty focused on heavy industry, mining and coal and nowadays it's in a transition phase to a modern metropolitan area. Pretty interesting place with a nice unique German culture. Cologne with the Kölner Dom is a safe bet for visiting tourists, also the Zollverein Coal Industrial Complex is nowadays a culture centre and UN World Heritage Site, if you want to learn more about the history of the region. 

If you can get to the North Bremen and especially Hamburg are very cool cities and give you a snapshot of the German coastal culture. Hamburg, Berlin and Munich are probably the most interesting and trendy cities in Germany right now. Berlin is of course always worth a visit.

Just use you common sense, people here are used to Americans and quite honestly we have a rather good opinion of the American people as individuals. You may get some flak about politics though, especially from idiots who are looking for a fight and want to be superior so try to avoid that minefield. ;)

First of, you shouldn't be too concerned about the language, everybody between 14 and 60 speaks english to a degree. Also, you can reach almost anything pretty easily by train. Look up everything [here](http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de). Depending on how long you're going to stay, you should visit some cities in the region:

* Cologne (nice cathedral, museums)
* Dortmund (Westenhellweg\*, Thier gallery*)
* Münster (beautiful Altstadt)
* Oberhausen (CentrO*)
* Bonn (old government district, museums)

*shopping centres

And if you have a whole day or even a weekend to spare you should definitely visit Berlin. There is an ICE-train going directly from Hamm to Berlin-Ostbahnhof, so you're there in less than three hours.

Culture-wise, your hosts will surely take care so that you don't look like the ""stupid fat american"", but some general things:

* When eating out, you tip when you enjoyed the service, not because the waiter/waitress has to live off of it. We have a minimum wage for everyone here, and although its still expected to tip, most germans ""round up"".
* Most germans don't enjoy smalltalk with strangers. When traveling alone for instance, you'll see that it's (most of the time) dead silent in trains or buses. 
* Don't be loud and obnoxiuos. The number one stereotype for american tourists is, that they're loud and obnoxious.

and who associate said connotations??

So?? How it is acceptable to associate lets say Chechs with commies, uneducated and uncivilized subhumans when it is not acceptable to call Germans killers, monsters and stain on human history which associates with Nazis? 

Eastern Europe is a political term to describe states under Russian occupation (or communism if you prefer) during cold war (1947-1991) and anyone using this term today is uneducated himself.

true,anunknownanon,ANAR,Anarchy,"Well in fact it is already like that. In most countries you don't pay as high of a tax for owning a car but you pay fees for using the highways.

In Germany you don't need to pay fees but you pay it with your taxes.

If you don't have your car registered in Germany (e.g. if you live elsewhere) and come here, you essentially use the roads without paying for them. This is what many regard as unfair.

Personally I think it is okay to have some people (the number is by no means significant as trucks already have to pay fees anyways) use the roads for free. Also introducing a fee system for such a little amount of money is quite uneffective. A more debatable view of mine is that I would find it good to be nice to people visiting Germany and don't make them pay.

Maybe the best solution (also to fight the envy of Germans who were forced to pay fees when driving through a neighbouring country) would be to get some bilateral treaties going so that you don't need to pay fees in other countries with a German number plate just like people from there don't need to pay anything here.

Je peux pas être plus clair. Avant d'affirmer avec tant d'assurance que j'ai pas lu quelque chose, commence un minimum par réfléchir à ce que j'écris avant de répondre. Je lis ce que tu écris, et j'essaie de le comprendre, montre un minimum de respect en faisant de même.

&gt; La démocratie est impossible. Il n'existe aucun système démocratique.

Encore une fois, je n'insulte pas ton intelligence, n'insulte pas la mienne. Un peu de bonne foi, on parle d'idées, donc de principe de la démocratie. Si on devait par exemple amener le relativisme sur la réalité des choses, il se heurterait immédiatement à des obstacles insurmontables.

Par le passé tu n'as jamais manqué de me signaler les aspects pas toujours glorieux de la politique eh bien cette séquence en est une, il s'agit d'une bête pêche au voix communautaire. Comme le prouve l'attaque envers Sarkozy, Valls essaie de récupérer les voix de la communauté juive, il n'y a rien de choquant pour un observateur de la vie politique de ce pays. Ceci dit, je suis certain que ceux qui martèlent la séquence du ""quand même"" oublieront de rappeler le contexte à savoir que Manuel Valls était le directeur de la communication du candidat Hollande et que son parti, comme les autres a voulu ""draguer"" les voix de toutes les communautés, cultes, associations, régions, syndicats, groupes de pression, corporations, etc, influents de ce pays, en leur promettant à chaque fois que son candidat était évidemment le mieux placé pour défendre leurs intérêts.

Finalement à l'image de la séquence du ""quand même"", on isole un passage, on le passe en boucle pour lui donner un sens qu'il n'a pas quand on le regarde dans son contexte. Yann Barthès (que tu aimes autant que moi) n'aurait pas renié cette méthode.

Crois moi, je n'aime pas plus que toi cet aspect communautaire de notre vie politique, mais utiliser cette séquence du ""quand même"" ne fait pas grand chose à mon humble avis si ce n'est décrédibiliser ceux et celles qui l'emploient. Maintenant faites ce que vous voulez braves gens.

A recovery in domestic consumption is therefore not sustainable, but dependent on the use of savings. The savings will somewhen be completeley spent and will not recover, if the households will not have an income, that allows them to save money.

For the argument of S&amp;P's rating depicting something else than the economic situation of a country, I would also point out to Sweden, Austria and Belgium. Sweden has been rated at AAA and should therefore be an example of the level and development, that would be expected for such a rating. Austria and Belgium have, like France, been downgraded to AA. The development of the GNI per capita shows, that Sweden, Austria and Belgium show a higher GNI per capita. While the GNI p.c. rose for Sweden, it stayed about the same in Austria and Belgium. Given the fact, that the GNI p.c. and other indicators show a significant decline in the UK, the AAA-rating is questionable and indicates, that the rating agencies rate something else than macroeconomic indicators.

In fact, these 'concentration' camps - there term had no pejorative implication until the Nazi era - were set up for the Boers' protection off the veldt, and were run as efficiently and humanely as possible, given the Boer commandos' own constant disruption of rail-borne supplies into them. A civilian surgeon Dr Alec Kay, writing in 1901, gave a further reason why the death rates were so high: 

&gt;&gt;The Boers in the caps often depended on home remedies, with deplorable results. Inflammation of the lungs and enteric fever are frequently treated by the stomach of a sheep or goat, which has been killed at the bedside of the patient, being placed hoat and bloody over the chest or abdomen; cow dung poultices are a favourite remedy for many skin diseases; lice are given for jaundice and crushed bugs for convulsions in children.

In all, 1,090 terrorists were hanged and at times as many as 71,000 were held in detention. On occasion the pro-British black Kenyan loyalists committed serious abuses against the mainly Kikuyu tribe Mau Mau terrorist. In 1959, the revelation that twelve terrorists had been beaten to death in the Hola Camp provoked an outcry in the House of Commons, and within four years Kenya was granted her independence. In all, between 12,000 and 20,000 Mau Mau were killed furing the fourteen years of troubles, or below the average of post war conflicts. Even if the figure was as high as 20,000 - as one recent study by historian David Anderson suggests- it was certainly nothing like the 300,000 recently claimed in a book entitled *Britain's Gulag*, or the 450,000 claimed by an egregious BBC TV documentary equally provatively entitled *Kenay: White Terror*. Such figures are truly absurd.

As for Amritsar all that can really be said is 
&gt;""The biographies of Dyer [The officer in command] show that he was clearly mentally abnormal, and there was no way he should have been in charge of troops.""

Besides, sorry to be so cold, but 379 people is not a genocide. But their are bad individuals in every country. 

When Settlers in Australia did go out and to kill Aboriginals it was often in retribution for Aboriginals killing a settler or cattle rustling or crop burning. Again there was never an organised program of genocide.

Regardless,

&gt;A characteristic of of the English-speaking peoples displayed both in South Africa and in the Philippines at the dawn of the twentieth century, and then fairly regularly ever since, was their tendency towards ruthlessness in warfare. For all that they are slow to anger, they have historically been very hard-nosed once the fighting was actually taking place, although this has often been tempered by a tendency to treat defeated enemies generously. Plenty of what in the luxury of peacetime have been called 'war crimes' have been laid at their door since 1901. In the Boer War, there was a scandal that centered on two Australian officers, Lieutenants HH 'Breaker' Morant and PJ Handcock, who were executed for fighting a dirty war in th Zoutpansberg and Spelonken areas of the northern Transvaal in 1901, which involved the murder of eight Boer prisoners of war. Even so, as with the prisoner abuse scandal over Abu Ghraib prison in Iraw in 2004, once the relevant authorities were apprised of the facts of the case they acted decisively, through courts-martial.
&gt;
&gt;No-one in history has done more for the concept of human beings having certain inalienable rights than the English-speaking peoples, and it is often solely because of their belief in the rule of law that abuses ever come to light and are punished. Every war has thrown up its dirty secret, such as Britain's Hola Camp in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion, or America's My Lai massacre in Viernam, or at Abu Ghraib in the Iraq War. To expect anything different is to misunderstand the way humans behave in wartime, from whichever colour, creed or class they hail. What is needed is a legal device to correct abuses, and that is something that the English speaking world has generally had in place, but which the Germans in 1900s' Angola, the Japanese in 1930s' China, the French in 1950s' Algeria and the Russians in 1980s' Afghanistan had not. The difference is not that the English speaking peoples never commit crimes in wartime, but rather that their open societies and free press ten to ensure that these are punished, while many other societies' crimes rarely are, or are even acknowledged.

Not requiring people (either through stigma or rules) to translate things, however small, allows for greater amounts of content to be posted here which is undoubtedly good and also allows for a more genuine view into various European cultures by seeing primary sources and secondary sources rather than just secondary and tertiary sources.

The fact that there exists, say, de.reddit.com for a German-language interface (and similarly for various other languages), suggests that Reddit as a whole officially sanctions content in languages other than English.  I wonder if anyone uses it, though.

There is only that one track leading through Odense, so re-routing is impossible. Additionally, the police was a bit slow with providing a time estimate, so for hours no busses were called in as an alternative.

- The danish women's handball team won Bronze at the WC in Serbia.

- The danish Tax office has just opened a new 'Visitation and Control' unit, which is to investigate tax fraud, based on the ever increasing amount of anomymous tips they get each year (around 10.000).

No, it banned the selling of slaves. Slave owning itself was still legal for another 30 odd years. And ships carrying slaves were still free to dock there.

I just checked out the reference. There are only 9 references to ships landing there in that whole period carrying slaves. But the salient part of the wikipedia article is this:

&gt;Exactly how many slaves were brought to the New World on Swedish ships is yet impossible to know, since most of the archives documents have not been investigated seriously in that respect, and many of them are by now not accessible because of their bad preservation and non microfilming.[14] Nevertheless some data, mostly concerning the former Swedish island Saint-Barthélemy, is now available online.[15]

It's likely that there were considerably more than just those 1283, especially given that there were economic incentives put in place for Swedish slave ships.

But this gun/libertarian horse shit is not one of those good ideas. Though it may gain popularity, it will not make the world a better place. Because it is the *antithesis* of civilisation. It is the *antithesis* of society. It will make the world more lonely, more nasty, more hostile, more unequal, and will tear shreds through the *trust* that we rely on as a society.

Hah, they've been the subject of books for ages. People on the left have been desperate to pin extensive slavery-participation on us to justify mass-immigration in the same way they tried to pretend the Sami had some kind of native american treatment.

I understand that some countries have two separate subreddits, one in the English name of the country and one in the native name (assuming there is only one native language), e.g., /r/germany versus /r/deutschland, so content of various languages can be separated.  On the other hand, there's only one /r/france for both ""anything related to France (in English or French)"" and ""anything in French (concerning any topic whatsoever)"", I've given up on bitching about how utterly stupid this is (because the set of people interested in the one and the other are very much disjoint).

I think it's a bit sad that Reddit, and /r/europe in particular, basically has no truly multilingual communication.

true,mantasm_lt,null,null,"It depends on what is Polish culture. Lithuanian nobles were slowly polonized. By the end of Poland-Lithuanian republic virtually all of the nobbles were speaking Polish, most of them didn't speak Lithuanian too. But there was a lot of separation in place. For example, Lithuanian Grand Duchy law was valid till mid 19th century. By the way, it included a line saying that Poles can't move to Lithuanian territory except due to marriage. I wouldn't call a center of Polish culture :) According to Russian government, there was &gt; 50% of Lithuanians in Vilnius region at the end of 19th century. Vilnius city itself was mostly Jews though.

Other thing is church in Lithuania was ruled by priests from Poland. Since the baptisation in 14th century, church was trying to enforce Polish language. Church-issued papers were in Polish and people's names were translated. Thus people who called themselves Lithuanians and spoke Lithuanian at home had Polish-sounding names. In addition to that, church said that ""Lithuanian language is poor man's language and god doesn't speak Lithuanian, he speaks Polish"" and tried to enforce that as much as possible. Thanks to that, some local people despised their lineage and tried to become as Polish as possible.

After the annexation, Poles were actively colonising the region. Lithuanian schools were limited and they were closed. Most Lithuanians moved out to Lithuania republic soon after annexation. Some stayed behind. It wasn't uncommon for Poles militia to raid a village and check everyone's passports. Non-poles were shot and/or their houses burned. Poland brought in farmers from other parts of Poland as well.

Fun fact, people who currently call themselves Poles in Lithuania don't speak Polish. Their mother tongue is a mix of Russian and Lithuanian. They don't understand proper Polish at all. Big part of them are soviet times immigrants from Belarus and other Russian-speaking regions.

&gt;Haha. Hun var komisk ja! 

These are from a total of 95 comments on the match. For the non-Scandinavians, these are all incredibly rude comments on the weight of Angola's goalkeeper. Apparently, this is common in Norway - mocking the opponents' weight. 

I can do the Serbia match, too, if you'd like? There are even worse comments ... about how fat and unfit Serbia's pivot was. The very same pivot who just received a silver medal (something you didn't manage) and was pronounced the best pivot of the entire tournament after the final.

I have watched all of Denmark's matches. We played Serbia, too. There was a total of zero comments on how fat or unattractive our opponents were.

 Yes, maybe we're not massively different, but in many ways having a common language can make your differences *even more* apparent. Since we can communicate with each other without language barriers (maybe dialect ones, but still) it only serves to highlight how we have different origins, cultures, attitudes and national identities. 

 The cultures of Europe aren't really massively different in the end of the day. I can certainly speak for Western Europe since I've been to almost every country in it.

In questo momento ho 21 anni e da quando appresi il concetto di anarchia (a 14), mi ritengo un forte simpatizzante dell'anarchia.
Dai 14 ai 16 anni ero letteralmente fissato, quello che stava alla base della mia fissa adolescenziale era la forte componente di ribellione verso le ""ingiustizie"" contenuta nell'anarchia. Probabilmente è una delle ideologie più ""buone d'animo"" che ci siano.
Nel trend più generale l'essere anarchico significa essere contro le istituzioni politiche, sono veramente pochi i gruppi anarchici con ideologie davvero interessanti e non formati da ragazzini superbi e arrabbiati. Io ero uno di loro.
In questo preciso momento sono stanco e non riesco neanche a ragionare ed esprimermi al meglio, quello che ci tengo a trasmettere è il mio attuale concetto di anarchia.
Su ispirazione di uno di questi famosi pensatori anarchici io sono per la ribellione non per la rivoluzione. Deve partire tutto dal singolo individuo, la società è un riflesso. La politica sei tu, la guerra nel mondo sei tu, la fame nel mondo sei tu.
Attivando in se stessi un atteggiamento positivo si scatenano reazioni positive a catena. Be the change you wanna see in the world. Io non voglio un mondo alla centro sociale e nemmeno un mondo di intellettualoidi hipster che il massimo di anarchico che fanno sono i flash-mob e aprire radio. Il mondo, è questo il concetto fondamentale oscuro a praticamente tutte le ideologie e le politiche, è perfetto così com'è. Dietro ogni azione di una persona c'è una ragione. E' una cosa di una complessità stupenda su cui sto aprendo gli occhi da poco rispetto al semplicistico pensiero estremista che avevo.
Sono anarco individualista? Non lo so. Mi piacerebbe altrettanto organizzarmi con altre persone e fondare un villaggio, in cui si vive come si vive al di fuori, sì la famiglia, sì chi vuole può anche avere una tv, ma dove si vive meglio perchè si mangia di quel che si coltiva, dove i soldi non sono necessari, perchè **ai bisogni primari di tutti ci contribuiamo tutti e tutti insieme** non tutti da soli come accade nel lavoro classico. Dai, è paradossale come funziona il lavoro, come funziona il denaro. La maggior parte di noi lavora alla fine per quelli che sono i bisogni primari (casa, cibo, salute) e null'altro. Se una manciata di persone non ricavasse immenso profitto dai bisogni primari staremmo tutti meglio.

From a macroeconomic perspective, if each country tries to maximise its exports and minimise its imports (mercantilism) then the whole house of cards falls apart pretty quickly. Therefore, if the rich countries help the poor a bit, they can minimise the chances that the economic system will fall apart. 

The US did something like that after WW2 until the end of the [Bretton Woods system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system).

Way back when, country people moved to Dublin to find work, and that bred disdain in many of the locals. The word culchie comes from ""cúl an tí"" meaning ""back of the house"" in Irish, due to the tendency of people in rural Ireland to informally enter each others' houses through a back or side door.

Anyway, after independence, most public service workers (Police, teachers, civil servants and whatnot) were country people because fluency in the Irish language was a prerequisite for these jobs. Irish fluency wasn't common among native Dubliners, so this perceived favouritism did have a negative effect on the ability of Dubliners and people of other counties to relate to each other, especially among the older generations. 

I don't know why I would be downvoted for trying to explain in an unbiased way why there is a difference, I have no motive for saying that Dubliners are worse or ""less Irish"" than people from other counties.

Initially the government wanted all teachers in this situation to take the exam but after many protests, the government decided to compromise with the unions. It was the modified so that only teachers with less than five years teaching experience had to take it. 

The exam was this wednesday but there was a massive boycott and only about 40% of those who were supposed to take the exam did it. Still, the government already announced a new date for it.

In my opinion, this whole thing makes very little sense. These teachers already have a university degree - which in itself means they were evaluated and certified.

Only that's not just against the rules of Lisbon, it's also against the rules of the WTO, which the EU is party to.

So no, that isn't an assumption.

&gt;You're assuming you won't increase the Scottish and Irish desire for independence and reunification respectively.

And?

They're not going anywhere and we'll still trade with them.  As it is Scottish independence is looking increasingly unlikely regardless (and Scotland isn't nearly as Europhile as people make out, it's only marginally less Eurosceptic than the UK), and Northern Ireland is a net recipient of the rUK, and the polls there are even less likely to support independence, but they have been promised a referendum in the Downing Street Declaration if they should ask (for 20 years now).

No real assumption there either.

&gt;And you seem to be okay with Norwegian fax democracy; yeah, you're not in the EU, but you get to do what Brussels says anyway.

Nope, that's the EEA not EFTA or AA (which the Spinelli Federalists have pledged), and besides Norway gets a veto (which they recently used).  No veto on regulation in the EU.  If it passes it passes and not just on business that trades with the EU (~92% of UK GDP is not connected to Europe)- regulations and directives passed whilst in the EU apply to 100% of business regardless.

So no assumption there either.

&gt;Or they could treaty change without a British veto. 

They can't whilst the UK is part of the EU.  If the UK is party to existing treaties, which they currently are, then they need the UK to support it.  Same goes for the other 27.

&gt; I'm not familiar with how the WTO would get involved, but couldn't the EU just... not have a free trade agreement with the UK anymore if it so desired?

The WTO principle at a basic level is simple really.  You can't discriminate between signatories so if the UK signs a deal with the EU (which is all but guaranteed under Lisbon, and has been offered by the Federalists already as an Associate Agreement), then individual member states of the EU don't get to pull rank.

As for could the EU just not have a trade agreement - they already have a trade agreement outside the EU with the UK.  The UK signed the European Free Trade Agreement twice, as both a member of the EU and as an individual state.  Everybody did that was a member around the time Maastricht was passed.  Apart from that it's one of those win-win scenarios.  It's not in anyone's interest to stop trading if political union ceases to be viable.  The EU trades with lots of countries, and has lots of agreements, without requiring political union.

- English people are bit more reserved in their interactions (when not drinking)

- In England, if you say something and someone doesn't believe you they will immediately and bluntly call you out on it. In Ireland, for the sake of banter we will (tend to) go along with what you say, but if you're wrong our opinion of you will suffer dramatically.

- English people (tend to, not all obviously) tend to speak their mind directly, in many ways an admirable trait in the same vein as other Germanic cultures. In Ireland, feel free to say what you want but you have to be more careful about how you say it. 

- We're a bit mad in the head back home I'd say, but England has an eccentricity and desire for innovation that by and large we just don't have, which I admire very much about them.

- English people are more formal and hierarchical than us. As a result, our class system is not as well defined.

Nor have the regions changed which you very well know. You are claiming that a country who elected and reelected Berlusconi after decades in the EU was not corrupt? Why are they still corrupt then. 

I didn't say they weren't corrupt; I said the EU's mechanism to deal with corruption didn't even exist back then.

&gt; You are making the claim- you prove that the EU makes the countries less corrupt. 

You want me to get you the charts of the countries that signed Agreements and how their HDI went up and corruption went down? I want to make sure I have this straight.

&gt; Prove that the EU is less corrupt than Sweden.

How would one even do that?

&gt; And, how can you claim that adding corrupt countries makes the EU less corrupt? That does not add up with the facts, and you know it. Why do you lie?

That's not what I said. And by my count, you've used the words corrupt or some variation of it 15 times, and have personally accused me of being a liar. Maybe calm down a bit.

&gt; You are just making stuff up 

Please specifically point out which part of my posts is made up. With quotes; none of this fallacy business.

&gt; Also, how are you going to fight corruption? In my country we are extremely good at paying taxes. Isn't it unfair that others cheat? For starters, hue are you going to fix taxes in Greece? How are you going to fix corruption in Bulgaria? In detail, please. 

You seriously want me to fix every single problem in the world for you in this post? Why would I do that? This was my point; peace in Europe is more important than concerns about a few Bulgarians moving up north.

That's because everyone used to have his army weapon at home during the cold war. Since the cold war ended the number of weapons is steadily going down.

&gt; The last conflict they were in was 200 years ago. 

That would be Napoleon invading us in 1798. He united Switzerland and in the Congress of Vienna we got our souvereignty back 1815. After that there was a lot of turmoil ending with the [Sonderbundskrieg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderbund_War) 1847. 

&gt; Yet they have remained neutral ever since. But guess what, almost every bunker is rigged with explosives.

Armed neutrality, we wont meddle, but if you attack us we will go down with a boom. And we started to sell those bunkers. One guy is useing them to make Bitcoins. Others make archives with art or plant seeds. And three years ago, they found 400 'Schützenpanzer' staying around somewhere.

&gt; They have a navy despite being a landlocked country.

A merchant navy. The military has a few patrollboats to controll our borderlakes.

&gt; They are probably the Americans of Europe.

We are not. Our mentality with guns is very European. All these guns are locked away and without ammo.

&gt; They don't have a standing infantry army, instead the vast majority of Swiss men are conscripted into the militia to undergo basic military training, including weapons training. 

Yeah that's cold war. Currently 150k 'serve', wich is a lot, but not a vast majority. (Germanies army has 180k soldiers) And our army is mostly obsolete and useless anyway. We regularly invade Lichtenstein and they sometimes lose tanks or forget where they buried arsenals.

&gt; After that each soldier is required to keep their military weapon in case of an invasion. 

Not anymore. Cold War stuff.

I'm confused. The point of the EFTA now is being in the EEA with the EU without actually being a member of the Union. If you're not going to be part of the EEA as an EFTA member, then you just entered a free trade agreement with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Yay?

The pace in Macedonia is waaaay slower than in Denmark, people actually spend hours on-end sitting at cafes and just casually relaxing, whereas the cafe-culture in Denmark is sort of not so relaxed, easily shown by me finishing off my drinks, and meals etc before everybody else at the table, like not even just a little before, but a lot before.  


This will probably be for the entire balkan region: the nonstop folk-music and folk-dancing everywhere and at all times, and between all age-groups. I was asked if we had anything similar to this kind of folk-music-tradition in Denmark, and i could not think of anything of that magnitude, at all.


Also people living with their parents until they get married, which is also usually at somewhat old age (around 30 from what i've observed), and the family-bond also seem to be tighter than in Denmark in general. This is also probably more just a general southern-european thing aswell, more than specific to Macedonia.


Also religion seems to be a bigger part of life, and most people are more spiritual than is the case in Denmark. Taxi-drivers doing the sign of the cross when driving past graveyards always struck me as odd.

Everything being super cheap. People not caring much about people smoking, or kids/young people drinking alcohol (well not getting drunk obviously).

Crazy traffic, people driving like madmen even in curvy mountain-roads. Coming from a very flat country with people driving somewhat more reasonable i feel very fragile in most foreign countries traffic.. :P

The Crowns which both animals wear (on the lions head and the unicorn's neck) represent the presence of the monarchy. The phrase at the bottom ""dieu et mon droite"" is French, despite the de facto official language being English, it's an interesting nod to the history of French in England and the UK.

I think Sweden/Finland can be rather hard, since we basically swap places around top five/top ten, and have for ages,  but there should be huge differences from the Eastern European countries  that has been for a whole, like Poland, Hungary and the Baltics. And, of course, Southern Europe. There are a lot of data of corruption and its development so it should be plenty that proves how the corruption has gone down in Greece Spain and Portugal. Not to mention southern Italy, they have really harsh corruption laws in the whole world. and have been so long in the EU that they must be innocent as newborn babies by now. Obviously no risk at all that Italy is corrupt. I mean, they have the laws that the EU wants.......I mean, if laws is all you need as you say EU want, then Italy is one if the least corrupt countries in the world. Certainly a lot better than Scandinavia. 

But we both know that is not the case. If the laws was all that we need (and is all the EU demands-) what is wrong with Italy. That means that the EU isn't even demanding the right thing. Because again- Italy gas really tough anti corruption laws. 

Above all- this is of course something the EU should be able not just to prove, but easily provide of course. I mean, of the anti corruption measurements works one should see it. And concerned citizens should really have thus proven to them. 
 

So, please provide me with the fact that the EU lessens the corruption in a country. I'd like to see evidence from Eastern and Southern Europe. 10 countries will do. Oh, and can you also provide me with the proof that harsher laws even work (since you claim this is what the EU is using as working against corruption). Italy seem to be a prof that it doesn't you see, so I am questioning if it works at all. 

Is that clear now?

Y'up, unless someone is offering you AA status with the EU.  Which they are.

&gt;Provided France doesn't veto. Or anyone.

Then look who already has AA status, and look what the alternative to them is.  We already have a guarantee of EFTA with the recognised right to negotiate 'without prejudice'.

&gt; If you're not going to be part of the EEA as an EFTA member, then you just entered a free trade agreement with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Yay?

Nay.

EFTA is with all 28 member states.

&gt;And an EFTA afforded by the Lisbon Treaty?

No.  EFTA afforded by a signature already outside the EU.  Lisbon affords the right for an exiting member to negotiate trade without prejudice, backed up by the WTO.

&gt;Goods, capital, services and people; that's what the single market is. That's how it's defined. To change it, all 28 member states have to agree to a treaty change.

But we're talking about an agreement outside the 28, like what Mexico has, for example.

The EU already has free trade agreements around goods, capital, and service, without forcing freedom of movement of people.  This isn't an aberration to the norm, and the UK market is a much more powerful draw than Mexico, even if one ignores the preexisting agreements.

This really isn't a problem.  Most of the major global economies that trade with the EU (and the UK is still a major global economy in its own right) haven't yet established free trade agreements yet still trade.  The UK is already guaranteed one, however it may be negotiated, but it is essentially around a shrinking 8% of GDP.

I'm not intimidated by it.  As someone outside the UK if you want to disagree with the prognosis, then fine, but I'm okay with either EFTA, negotiated EFTA, or AA, as a preference over continued ever closer political union and the ESM.   More importantly the polls reflect that too.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association

&gt; The European Free Trade Association (EFTA, in French 'Association européenne de libre-échange' : AELE) is a free trade organisation between four European countries that operates in parallel with – and is linked to – the European Union (EU). The EFTA was established on 3 May 1960 as a trade bloc-alternative for European states who were either unable or unwilling to join the then-European Economic Community (EEC) which has now become the EU. The Stockholm Convention, establishing the EFTA, was signed on 4 January 1960 in the Swedish capital by seven countries (known as the ""outer seven"").

&gt; Today's EFTA members are Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway and Switzerland, of which the latter two were founding members. The initial Stockholm Convention was superseded by the Vaduz Convention, which enabled greater liberalisation of trade among the member states.

If you become an EFTA member (again), then you can freely trade with the rest of the EFTA, which is those 4 countries. You only be part of the single market as an EFTA state if you join the EEA, which all EFTA states except for Switzerland have done.

You're either in the EEA (which is the single market) or you're not. If you want the UK to leave the single market, but still trade with the EU, that's another thing entirely.

But my original comments stands. You can't have your cake (free movement of goods, capital and services) and eat it too (no free capital of labour).

Well, I'm not sure if the client can accurately determine the conditions under which a woman sells her body. I imagine people who are forced to be sex slaves don't reveal that fact to any client, as it would be quite a turnoff.

I'm not sure I can relate to that at all, because I feel that Sweden, Norway and Iceland are modern countries with a strong rule of law.

Vampire lounge is a great place for drinks, especially milk shake drinks. They have awesome decorations, especially in the toilets. Not much of a dance floor so mostly for socializing.

Under Bron (Under the bridge) is a place with all kinds of people, but mostly hipsters. In the summer they have ping pong tables out doors. It's open until 5 and they have good burgers for reasonable prices.

Sturecompagniet is a good place at Stureplan, a dressy place, expensive alcohol, big dance floor and beautiful people. Enjoyable in the right company, probably not otherwise.

Best are the out door forest raves, not exactly legal but seems to be tolerated. Awesome atmosphere and if you want to dance and meet nice people, I recommend it!

I was talking about shootings. But I guess we do have problems with those, in Marseilles notably. Can't see how giving firearms to law-abiding citizens will solve this though.

Wow... Once again, I'll explain slowly : America experiences much more violent crimes than we do in (western) Europe. And they're pretty much powerless against those in power, as countless exemples in the 20th century have shown. So what's the use of their beloved firearms, apart from ensuring that burglars will be equally armed, and that their kids will shoot themselves in the face when they don't lock it up properly ?

Hm. This... is not true. I don't think you fully understand the EEA and the EFTA mean. The EFTA is just the free trade agreement between Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Iceland.

Now. The EU allows these states into the single market within the EEA (read: single market). So every EFTA state has the right to be part of the market. Of the four, only Switzerland has declined to join, and they have bilateral treaties with the EU.

There is no ""opposed"" to the EEA in EFTA. The EEA is where most EU states (except Croatia) and most EFTA states (except Switzerland) meet.

You'r right in that it's equal, but it's equal in this as well: *there is freedom of movement of labour within the EEA*. The UK simply cannot have access to the single market and restrict freedom of labour at the same time. It can only pick one of these. I don't know why you're ignoring this, since this is the most important point I'm making; the Four Freedoms are what you have to accept if you want the single market, whether you're in the EU or not. The WTO isn't involved in this at all.

&gt;But I guess we do have problems with those, in Marseilles notably.

Yes we do, indeed, I'm glad your reckon that. Even in our beloved ""gun-free"" France, shootings happen all the time. Because guess ? Criminals are armed, since they couldn't care less about the law.

&gt;Can't see how giving firearms to law-abiding citizens will solve this though.

Can't you see how, if law-abiding citizens are armed, criminals will be much more reluctant to attack ? Can't you see that, by raising dramatically the potential cost of an agression, you make that agression much less likely to happen ? It's the same principle that applies to nuclear dissuasion, which results in peace.
Can't you see that armed police cannot be everywhere at the same time ? Can't you that law-abiding citizens, on the other hand, are everywhere ? If a shooting happens, what would be better ? That people called the police and wait 10min before they come ? During those 10min, the shooter can kill anybody he pleases. Or would you rather have a law-abiding citizens, carrying a weapon and stopping that mass shooting ? In the US : **""The average number of people killed in mass shootings when stopped by police is 14.29. The average number of people killed in a mass shooting when stopped by a civilian is 2.33""** ([source](http://dailyanarchist.com/2012/07/31/auditing-shooting-rampage-statistics/))

Je suis parti du principe que tu avais tort, sans penser à me remettre en question, et j'ai calé ça dans une phrase, l'air de rien. Ben toi, c'est pareil. Au lieu d'expliquer en quoi le port d'arme est ""légitime et important"", tu as dit ""il faut que les gens comprennent en quoi c'est légitime et important"". Aucune remise en question, paf, tu considères cette conclusion comme acquise et affirmes que c'est juste une question de la faire comprendre aux gens, qui sont cons (forcément, puisque s'ils étaient pas cons ils seraient d'accord avec toi).

&gt;America experiences much more violent crimes than we do in (western) Europe

Correlation is not causation. Crime has a loooot of variables in place, your view ""americans have guns and therefore a high violent crime rate"" is way too simplistic.
If more guns mean less crime, [please explain this to me](http://i.imgur.com/4JlVVwP.jpg). (sources are on the lower left corner)

&gt;And they're pretty much powerless against those in power

Huuu with nearly 300 million firearms in civilian hands, you must have a weird definition of ""powerless"". If they are indeed powerless, I wonder what that makes of us.. slaves ?

&gt;as countless exemples in the 20th century have shown

Do tell. I have plenty of exemples of genocides in the 20th century where those in power first disarmed the people. Not a single genocide occured on an armed people.

&gt;So what's the use of their beloved firearms

Self defense.

&gt;apart from ensuring that burglars will be equally armed

Agressing an armed victime is veeeery dangerous, even if you have yourself a firearm. The risks are great, most street thugs won't take it.

&gt;their kids will shoot themselves in the face when they don't lock it up properly ?

It is indeed tragic when this happens. But you have to put this into perspective : in the US every year there are about 300 such deaths. Although every single death is tragic, it's waaaaayyyy less that other causes of death for children, like drowning, falling, etc.. And nobody wants to ban swimming pool.

I hear you already :

*""But swimming pools have a legitimate purpose, having fun !""*

So do firearms. They have a legitimate purpose, beyond hunting and sports : self-defense. Each year in the US 2.5 millions times a gun is used in self-defense, that's 4 times the rate of agression with guns. 80% of the time not a single shot is fired. Only 8% of the time the agressor is wounded, something like 3% of the cases he dies.",0,1387771425,null,0,false,0,ce88h3m,t3_1tgamk,t1_ce88h3m,t1_ce87586,null,1428020508,0,false,france,t5_2qhjz,0

true,KatsumotoKurier,null,null,"That judgment about Canada is very correct. Many people live that lifestyle, and many do both and have cottages. My grandparents live life on a decently secluded lake in Northern Ontario, near Georgian Bay. It's very beautiful there and I suggest you look it up on google images for the scenery. There's much wildlife and absolute beauty. 

As far as I'm aware, as densely populated Germany is, I thought that there's a lot of open land too. Pictures I've seen of the areas in Bavaria, the Black Forest, or Neuschwanstein seem to have much open land. Germany is geographically very beautiful, as is Canada.

Anekdote: Abends, kaum Menschen unterwegs. Rollifahrer im U-Bahnhof. Fahrstuhl ausser Betrieb. Er steht am Fuss der endlosen Treppe und grübelt. 

Ich warte auf die Bahn und frage ""Brauchen Sie Hilfe?"" 

Er brüllt sofort los: ""SEH ICK SO AUS, ALS OB ICK HILFE BRAUCHE, DU PENNER?"" 

Gefühlte fünf Minuten später. Mit leiser Stimme meint er, ich kann ihm schon helfen, zumindest mit dem Rollstuhl. Ihm selber aber auf keinen Fall, det geht nich. 

Ich trage den Rollstuhl, er zieht sich endlos langsam Stufe für Stufe die Treppe hoch. ",0,1387775545,null,0,false,0,ce8a0vx,t3_1thkt2,t1_ce8a0vx,t3_1thkt2,null,1428019785,5,false,de,t5_22i0,5
