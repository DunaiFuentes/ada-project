shared apt = 300-450 euros/month

studio/1 bdroom apt = about 600-1k euros/month, depending on the area

groceries maybe another 100, i never counted

not sure where you're coming from, but compared to 'merica I found clothing and manufactured goods (electronics, etc) to be at least 30% to 50% more expensive, so definitely stock up on any of that before you go. 

things that are MUCH cheaper:

basically anything fresh or spanish:  red wine, beer, tomatoes, potatoes, fresh veggies, olive oil, onions, pork, sunshine

&gt;Also - ""Charity"" I don't think you understand the social critique of this system, it dosn't serve the population thats my critique.

Not everything needs to ""serve"" the population to the exact extent you demand in order to justify its existence. You're complaining that a business is not making decisions the benefit your particular perception of society, but a business cannot and should not be concerned with such things. Such perversion of its purpose makes it less efficient, harms the economy overall, and eventually reduces the tax revenue it provides the government, which in contrast does have a responsibility to social welfare.

&gt;Anyway and you support this!?

&gt;It's a fucking madness how a economic system can get so tyranical.

You don't appear to be aware of the definition of tyranny.

Contracts have defined terms. Show me a copy of this social contract. What, it doesn't actually exist? It's just an endless set of demands?

Of course there's democratic influence. If the company in question is publicly traded, any person can buy shares of it and vote on the issues. What socialists seem to have missed out on is that corporate ownership has become very decentralized. Companies are no longer owned by one or two people, but by a large segment of the population. Do you really think you're going to have success vilifying corporate shareholders when so many people are in that group, and where any punishment of that group would be exacted on their retirement accounts?

Actually not.  Just as I don't support National ""Socialism"" or any other bullshit which decides to employ the term for entirely instrumental and/or populist ends.  In this case, for the same reasons - because they killed and drove into exile those with my ideological perspective, but also more generally because they objectively didn't implement socialism, indeed, Lenin knew from the outset that they couldn't. The Soviet Union was, at best and most charitably, a holding action.

&gt;you seem to think every person is a ""worker"" in some industrial factory.

A worker is someone who works.  It's quite a technical definition to grasp, I know.

&gt;I'll believe in this centuries-long collaboration whenever I see actual evidence of it.

To take one modern example, what the hell do you think [ALEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council) is?

&gt;Is no land available for anyone that wants it?

Land is artificially scarce because of it.  In the days of the commons during early industrialisation, political commentators and legislators bemoaned the fact that there was no one willing to work their land nor fill their factories for salaries.  Views abound from this time period which make the case for enclosure:

""loyterers who will not usually be got to work unless they may
have such excessive wages as they themselves desire.""

""possessed of more land than his family can cultivate in the evenings (means that) the farmer can no longer depend on him for constant
work.""

""the use of common land by labourers operates upon the mind as a sort of independence.""

""among the greatest of evils to agriculture would be to place the labourer in a state of independence.""

""Farmers, like manufacturers, require constant labourers--men who have no other means of support than their daily labour, men whom they can depend on.""

""[E]very one but an idiot knows that the lower classes must be kept poor, or they will never be industrious.""

""to lay them under the necessity of labouring all the time they can spare from rest and sleep, in order to procure the common necessities of life.""

""That mankind in general, are naturally inclined to ease and indolence, we fatally experience to be true, from the conduct of our manufacturing populace, who do not labour, upon an average, above four days in a week, unless provisions happen to be very dear.... I hope I have said enough to make it appear that the moderate labour of six days in a week is no slavery.... But our populace have adopted a notion, that as Englishmen they enjoy a birthright privilege of being more free and independent than in any country in Europe. Now this idea, as far as it may affect the bravery of our troops, may be of some use; but the less the manufacturing poor have of it, certainly the better for themselves and for the State. The labouring people should never think themselves independent of their superiors.... It is extremely dangerous to encourage mobs in a commercial state like ours, where, perhaps, seven parts out of eight of the whole, are people with little or no property. The cure will not be perfect, till our manufacturing poor are contented to labour six days for the same sum which they now earn in four days.""

Eliminating the commons would create ""a body of men who earn their subsistence by working for others"" and there would, ""perhaps, be more labour, because there will be more compulsion to it.""

The Board of Agriculture gleefully noted enclosure of commons would force labourers ""to work every day in the year."" Children ""[would] be put out to labour early."" and the ""subordination of the lower ranks of society...would be thereby considerably secured.""

""Legal constraint to labour is attended with too much trouble, violence, and noise, creates ill will etc., whereas hunger is not only a peaceable, silent, unremitted pressure, but, as the most natural motive to industry and labour, it calls forth the most powerful exertions....


It seems to be a law of nature that the poor should be to a certain degree improvident, that there may be always some to fulfill the most servile, the most sordid, and the most ignoble offices in the community. The stock of human happiness is thereby much increased. The more delicate ones are thereby freed from drudgery, and can pursue higher callings etc. undisturbed.""

The problem is there are no direct flights from St Pierre et Miquelon to France. But as I understand it, when you're in France, you're in France...and the same goes for the EU or Schengen area.

So it seems to me that if I were legally admitted into St Pierre et Miquelon (which is a low threshold compared to entering continental Europe), if I chartered a plane or a boat directly to France, I would not have to clear or even report to customs and immigration.

Just as if I were in Quebec and set sail to PEI or Newfoundland, I might detour through international waters, but I wouldn't have to report to customs and immigration. So I suppose that technically by law I could sail directly from St Pierre et Miquelon directly to France, dock my boat and just go ashore. Or if I flew, I'd have a domestic flight plan. But if I originated from a few kms north (in Canada), that wouldn't be the case.

As a side note, I used to see a GMC full-size truck around Montreal that had EU/France plates on it. I know that when people bring in cars, they bring them in through a Canadian ports and then transport them to St Pierre et Miquelon. I was surprised France would plate a vehicle that isn't even for sale there. But it seems that technically to me you could even get a car that there's a ""special exception"" for in Canada, plated with France plates and then backdoor it to France.

He also said: ""I have never lived among german people.""
There are also no evidence that he identified himself with Austria.

I really like how you're trying to deflect blame for the failures of socialism by labeling them ""capitalist"". It's childish and vaguely insulting. Nope, the USSR was a very solid attempt at implementing your utopia. And all other attempts have followed the same trajectory.

&gt;The Soviet Union was, at best and most charitably, a holding action.

No, the Soviet Union was an honest attempt at socialism. Unfortunately, until Star Trek-esque replicators are invented and scarcity eliminated all attempts and creating a socialist society will end just as China, the USSR, Albania, Cambodia, North Korea, Yugoslavia, and Cuba have, and you'll drag hundreds of people to premature deaths in your quest. 

It's not a coincidence that all attempts at socialism have resulted in the same outcome. Honestly, from the sheer amount of class jealousy in your rhetoric you seem like a classic collectivist agitator. I'm sure that you'd love an opportunity to hang some kulaks. 

&gt;A worker is someone who works. It's quite a technical definition to grasp, I know.

""Worker"" is a generic term that ignores the very real differences between different sorts of employees. We don't all work in textile mills and coal mines nowadays. The term artificially lumps unskilled manual laborers with skilled labor and white collar employees. 

Unfortunately for you and your cause, skilled and white collar employees don't have the same goals and aspirations as laborers and the middle class they create will forever prevent your ideas from taking hold with them: they have too much to lose.

&gt;To take one modern example, what the hell do you think ALEC is?

Are you seriously blaming Enclosure on an American lobbying group formed in 1975? Or are you complaining that a political lobbying group for a certain political outlook is allowed to exist? This is more nonsense you can't substantiate, much like your abuse of the words ""coercion"", ""duress"", and ""slavery"". 

Why do collectivists need to lie so often to sell their case? I'm a misanthrope so I'm surprised you can't sell it to the masses on envy and jealous alone. My guess is that most people are sensible, and it's hard to convince someone to submit to slavery without lying excessively. 

&gt;Land is artificially scarce because of it. 

Land is cheap as hell. People could easily live off the grid. They just choose not to. The best part of it is that I know this irks socialists mightily. People don't want to live in a mud hut and wipe their asses with tree bark. They want to live in a city. They want television. The want their iPhones. And so they voluntarily opt in to capitalism. The alternative exists, no matter how you may wish to deny it. It is just vastly inferior to the fruits of capitalism.

&gt;In the days of the commons during early industrialisation, political commentators and legislators bemoaned the fact that there was no one willing to work their land nor fill their factories for salaries.

A group of random unattributed quotes does not a case make. Your conspiracy theory remains unproven.

&gt;The Board of Agriculture gleefully noted enclosure of commons would force labourers ""to work every day in the year."" Children ""[would] be put out to labour early."" and the ""subordination of the lower ranks of society...would be thereby considerably secured.""

And? Is it still legal to employ children or to mandate that employees work seven days a week? At the time of Enclosure, slavery was still legal in the US. Serfdom in Germany had recently ended. Serfdom in Russia wouldn't end for another half century, but it was rapidly reintroduced by the Soviets and continued until the late 1980s.

The UK was the most wealthy nation in the history of the planet at the time. Other non-rich people everywhere else on the planet have  suffered from equal or greater abuse, and have managed to move on without it creating a crippling, apparently-hereditary scar. Enclosure is an issue in the very distant past. Many, many events that topped it terms of trauma have transpired since. To claim that it has any significant effect today is absurd.

And here we get to the part where you blame the actions of imperialist monarchies on capitalism:

&gt;No, but it did have the Atlantic slave trade

Imperialist monarchies.

&gt;the Native American genocide

Legitimately ""our bad"", but not really done in the pursuit of capitalism. 

&gt;multitudinous wars - several on an industrial scale involving deaths in the millions, even tens of millions (in the case of WWII)

If you get to blame WWII on capitalists I get to blame it on socialists and the deaths cancel out.

&gt;100 million deaths in India (just from the post independence period)

Blaming them on capitalism is absurd. 

&gt;Leopold's private fiefdom in the Congo, apartheid

Another imperial monarchy.

&gt;the potato famine in Ireland

So you're blaming plagues on capitalism now? I didn't know bacteria had economic views.

&gt;several hundred thousand and possibly in excess of a million from the Iraq sanctions (many of whom were children)

Authorized by a great number of nations, many of which are not capitalist. 

&gt;endless anti-communist ""actions"" and the correspondingly brutal actions of the ugly dictators propped up or installed in pursuit of this policy

This is legitimate. However, each of those deaths probably prevented a hundred deaths that would have happened had a socialist government taken over.

Also, if you're going in the winter, I'd suggest getting a starter of Sopa Castellana. It's a huge bowl of chicken/meat broth with bacon, bread, onion, garlic and a raw egg they throw in there right before serving so that it cooks it while you're eating. To die for. Seriously. I've been in Spain for over 20 years now and that is the only place I'll order any of those dishes.

- Hugo Claus: Should have won the Nobel Prize by many accounts, although I can understand his books aren't always accessible to anyone outside of Belgium or Flanders (especially his seminal work The Sorrow Of Belgium (Het Verdriet Van België) which is a bildungsnovel of the artist and talks, among other things, about how the Flemish movement was co-opted by the Nazis. His poetry is why I love him, mostly. The Poems From Oostakker (Oostakkerse gedichten) are to my mind, a high point in late-modern poetry. His plays are also great (Bruid In De Morgen, Suiker, ...)

- Other great poets that need a text of the length above are Leonard Nolens and Herman De Coninck. Nolens is pretty heavy shit. His last book, Zeg aan de kinderen dat we niet deugen (Please tell the children we're flawed) is completely amazing. Herman De Coninck is lighter and more tender but similarly beautiful. Earlier we have Paul Van Ostaijen and Guido Gezelle, Karel Van De Woestijne

-  Tom Lanoye is pretty popular: His novels (or the ones I've read) talk about the multicultural city and homosexuality. They're funny and beautiful. His plays are beyond reproach. I'm not a big fan of his poetry, but his essays are great.

Other Names with their most known books are: Willem Elsschot (Kaas, Lijmen/Het Been, Het Dwaallicht), Hubert Lampo (De komst van Joachim Stiller), Johan Daisne (Trap van Steen en Wolken, Trein der traagheid)

Firstly, you need to listen to [this (reasonably short) clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQsceZ9skQI) - and feel free to fast forward past the questioner's whiny rant at the beginning (to about a minute or so in). That addresses Lenninism and Trotskyism as opposed to libertarian socialism/communism and the unholy alliance of Eastern and Western propaganda machines on pretending the USSR was socialist.  Then, rather than post it all again, [here's a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1628qm/we_have_become_slaves_to_our_economic_system_and/c7sjfy5) to a post where I made about how much ""socialism"" there actually was in the Soviet Union.

&gt;Unfortunately, until Star Trek-esque replicators are invented and scarcity eliminated all attempts and creating a socialist society will end just as China, the USSR, Albania, Cambodia, North Korea, Yugoslavia, and Cuba have, and you'll drag hundreds of people to premature deaths in your quest. 

Well, to an extent I agree, in that I'm not a communist, and I think communism may be desirable and well-intentioned, but will remain beyond reach until we arrive at some post-scarcity future (though I prefer Iain Banks' Culture to Star-Trek).  Having said that, I note both that you're focusing on authoritarian ""socialist"" States rather than considering those few and fairly short libertarian experiments that there have been - anarchist Catalonia, free Ukraine, and that you seem to forget that the definition of communism is a classless, moneyless, **Stateless** society.

&gt;We don't all work in textile mills and coal mines nowadays. The term artificially lumps unskilled manual laborers with skilled labor and white collar employees. 

Why is it artificial?  If you work, you're a worker.  Of course, people can act as both capitalist and worker in the same role or across time, and there's plenty of work which is not productive.

&gt;Are you seriously blaming Enclosure on an American lobbying group formed in 1975? Or are you complaining that a political lobbying group for a certain political outlook is allowed to exist? This is more nonsense you can't substantiate, much like your abuse of the words ""coercion"", ""duress"", and ""slavery"". 

WTF?!  I suspect you're just being disingenuous now.  The Enclosure Acts were an important component of primitive accumulation, just as the homesteading provisions in the US were; ALEC is evidence that the ""conspiracy"" as you've chosen to label it between corporations/capitalists/the ruling elite (choose your own terminology) and government to create a legal, political and social framework where workers are coerced into unfavourable employment conditions is an ongoing project.  It was just an obvious and current one I thought you might be familiar with.

&gt;Why do collectivists need to lie so often to sell their case?

I really can't be arsed to take this any further with you because you're clearly just into throwing around insults because you can't debate your corner.

&gt;Land is cheap as hell. People could easily live off the grid.

Dunno about where you live, but land with planning permission (another example of artificial scarcity to keep workers in line) is outrageous in the UK.  The cost of construction/the building(s) is less significant in comparison.  So, GBP4-10k per acre versus GBP200k per acre.

&gt;The best part of it is that I know this irks socialists mightily. People don't want to live in a mud hut and wipe their asses with tree bark. They want to live in a city. They want television. The want their iPhones.

None of it irks me particularly, since I'm not a primitivist, on the contrary, I'm more of a transhumanist/futurist, but I do think it should be an option people can have a reasonable opportunity to select from, and I think it's pretty inevitable it'll have to become much much more common in the future given some of the issues we face ecologically and in terms of global energy/resources.

&gt;here we get to the part where you blame the actions of imperialist monarchies on capitalism

Can't imperialist monarchies _be_ capitalist?  Most were, Britain still is (though more neo-imperialist these days and does its dirty work as the US's baby sidekick).

&gt;If you get to blame WWII on capitalists I get to blame it on socialists and the deaths cancel out.

Not by any stretch.

&gt;Blaming them on capitalism is absurd. 

It's pretty clear to me.  You're just acting like the Stalin deniers did in the last century.  When it's all over, people will look back at people like you, apologists for the horrors of capitalism, aghast.

&gt;So you're blaming plagues on capitalism now? I didn't know bacteria had economic views.

The blight was nature, the famine was policy.

true,pamporidis,CYPR,Cyprus,"As a cypriot i would like to describe the situation in the island (Sorry for the wall of text):
According to our goverment, we have enough money to cover salaries and pensions until March. Due to the country's ratings we are excluded from borrowing money from the markets, and our banks are already in need of repacitalisation (not sure if this is the correct word, i translated it from Greek) so they cannot lend the state. If the Cyprus bailout is not agreed until Mid-February (taking into consideration that the approval from member states takes approximately 6 weeks) then Cyprus will go into bankruptcy. 
As you can understand this delay (talks with imf-ecb-eu have began from last June) is greatly undermining the economy in the island, as the uncertainty is forcing businesses to withdraw from any activities involving even the slightest amount of economic risk. Moreover, banks are almost unable to provide any loans and even if they could the interest rate providede would be unbearable for the loan taker.

As prollyjustsomeweirdo has stated, a bank reform is necessary and has already been agreed in the momerandum agreed by the goverment in order to reduce the size of the banking sector. Moreover actions have been taken and will be taken (once again based on the memorandumg agreed between Cyprus and the Troika) in order to ensure that money laundering does not take place on the island. As far as tax laws, the only tax   that hasnt been increased is the company tax, which is quite low but is used to attract foreign investments from other countries (have to admit mainly Russia). If this tax is raised then companies storing their assets in Cyprus will have them moved to other countries (Estonia, Malta) thus creating bigger problems for the Banks and therefore for our deficit. If the company tax MUST be raised, then the raise should be in stages and not too big.

The economic problem that Cyprus faces at the moment has been mainly caused but the heavy exposure of Cypriot Banks to the Greek economy along with the recent 75% haircut of private-held Greek debt  which has accumulated 10 billion euro damages to the Cypriot banks, which must now be saved by the state. Take in mind that the bailout is 17billion, so you can understand that 10 of these will go directly to the banks. The other 7 are to cover the state needs up to 2016.

Overall, we are in a very very bad situation. We cannot borrow money from anyone, we have already borrowed money internally and there just arent any more left atm. I know we are not too big to fail but i want to believe, i really do, that the politics will understand that there are European Citizens struggling to survive and that they will not see just some numbers when they take a look at Cyprus, but some fellow Europeans.

&gt; So? Does that mean we should accept the bad from immigrants?

Absolutely not. But a lot of it is good culture or different culture. Much of the ""bad culture"" is against the law (underage weddings, hate speech, multiple marriages, forced or set up marriages). Culture can be so many things like different holidays, different traditions, different foods and different habits which not necessarily is good or bad.

&gt; Learning the indigenous language is a part of assimilation and the fact it is important does not make it any less so.

It's part of living in a different country. So yes it's part of both integration and assimilation. It's not very relevant to this topic. Understanding the language is important to be able to function in society.

&gt; The complete lack of proper assimilation has only made the ghetto problem grow. The moment you create a ghetto you also have to spend resources to mend it.

I see poverty as a big part of the problem in ghettos. It's not necessarily only bad integration policies. I know that many immigrants live normal lives in good areas.

&gt; Because citizenship is important and thinking that it is not in a discussion of immigration is frankly silly.

Why? Is it wrong to not want to be a citizen? As long as the person lives a normal and healthy live and contributing to society I see nothing wrong with it.

&gt; The reason I don't bring up data is because the information you request is trivial and only requires some searching. If you are uninformed, with the Internet, it is only your own fault. Yes poverty is a part of it, yes unemployment is partly the cause of that, and guess what is the cause of unemployment? Guess what cause people to band together in ghettoes? Use that brain evolution gave you.

It's very cheap living in ghettos. That's one reason many immigrants live there. If they could afford living in a nice area then they would. Many of them come here with nothing. Possibly an education which is not valid in Sweden or Denmark. Do you think they enjoy being surrounded by crime and poverty? Would you want to live in a Danish area filled with poverty or crime or live in a different area which has little to no crime? Use your brain.

&gt; You're just repeating what you already said. As I said: That is not a quality worthy of praise. That is simple duty. A quality worthy of scorn would be the opposite of what you wrote and a quality worthy of praise is assimilation. In other words what you wrote is not really a quality, it is the standard. What you are expected to do.

Of course this is what is expected. I don't really expect anything more. I frankly don't care if they do more. They can help our society by replacing the people who are leaving Denmark and Sweden. Especially if they are young.

&gt; No. It is conforming to a new culture. It does not necessitate a complete destruction of identity as you profess.

We disagree on this. Assimilation in my opinion is when you drop at least a big portion of your own culture. I think everybody can agree with that immigrants (or anyone else for that matter) should follow the law, not commit crimes and pay tax. Living a normal life.

&gt; I'm not scared, I am sensible. There is a difference. Someday you might figure that out. And, I might add, our constitution is not a holy book. It never has been. It is dictated by the people. We have changed it several times already. We also have different laws than freedom of religion and freedom of speech (in case you did not know).

No. You are in denial. You are scared of parallel societies. You are scared of different cultures because you think they might cause national instability. Sweden has had religious freedom since 1952. I consider it a part of Swedish culture. I have a hard time believing that religious freedom is a new concept in Denmark.

&gt; So, let me reiterate... We got a British guy from the UK who spend most of his time in Sudan and magically you think I wish to revoke his UK citizenship because he spends a lot of time in Sudan? What?

You said a person has to be culturally Danish to be have (or acquire) Danish citizenship. He is not culturally English and I don't think he will ever consider himself English, yet he still holds a UK citizenship. There are many people who think that children of immigrants or visitors should not have a citizenship because the child was born in that country.

&gt; Then Scandinavia might not be the place for you to live. Our government is everywhere. It's one of the reasons why it is the best place on Earth to live.

Sweden is the right place for me to live. Maybe not Denmark. Stockholm is one of the most liberal cities in Scandinavia and I am not alone here (neither in Stockholm, Sweden or Scandinavia) who has this political opinion. However I know that places like the rural areas in Småland is no place for me. Too conservative and too racist.

&gt; What I am talking about however is not telling you what religion to believe in. You can have choices. Only the state will control these religions and what they preach. You can be a Muslim, but the Islam you will follow is a heavily modified one - one that suits our society. It would give all the good things religion can give, while probably avoiding most of the bad.

You can't tell by law what people should believe in. They are allowed to believe in the craziest things but if they ever break the law they will be punished. Every person interprets his or her own religion their own way. Most things people believe are compatible with a free society. This includes Christians, Jews and Muslims. It's all about how conservative the person is. People try to justify their bad actions using their religion. We can agree that this is wrong.

The state should never tell what a person should or should not believe, this is regarding both people or politics. It's not the role of the state to decide that, at least not in a free society. I won't let my government spoon feed me about what is right or wrong. It's the people who should tell the government what is right or wrong. It's called democracy. We vote for our government. Anything else would be fascist, theocratical or communist. Education kills almost all extremism which you seem to be very afraid of.

&gt; Religion is a part of society, wish it or not. Why should the state no organize religion in a way that is benign to the rest of society? Take down all of the extremist churches and mosques and replace them with supervised moderate churches and mosques with a heavy humanist and philosophic influence. That would be preferable to letting madness run amok in society.

In Sweden state and church is split. That is a reason to why the state shouldn't interfere with the church. Religion in Sweden is a very small part of society. The church has little to no power. Education will prevent extremism. A good way of avoiding the start of extremism is to supply society with normal churches and normal mosques. We don't want Saudi oil barons to fund Wahhabi and Salafist mosques because there aren't any mosques in the first place. When extremism is started it is not a simple task to eradicate it. Pushing mosques underground makes it more vulnerable to extremism.

&gt; Just because it is a law, then it does not make it a value. Stop being an idiot, please.

In Sweden it a Swedish value and tradition. It has been law for a very long time. Tolerance is a Swedish value. Saying anything else as a Swede is unswedish. As I don't think it is very different in Denmark.

&gt; Generally the Nazis are not the ones causing any violence at all in Denmark. Their peaceful protests are often attacked and opposed by anarchists however, so they get violent as a result.
And must I absolutely stress that I do not by default find Muslims violent? Where do you get this absurd idea from? Seriously half your perceptions about me seems to be magically spun from the air to suit your - wrong by the way - narrative of me as some sort of racist bigot.
Now, the extremely obvious point that was made is that a believer is easier for an extremist to turn into another extremist. Get it? Faith is a gateway to madness.
And please, don't bring up Christianity. There is 500 years of moderation between that and Islam, and even then Christianity is obviously still harmful. Just not as much. Islam is in its 'Witch Hunt' stage. Remember those lovely religious wars all across Europe when the Catholic Church splintered? The Crusades? Yeah, many segments of Islam still think we are back there. Some Christian segments certainly do too.

The fact that you demand assimilation makes you seem racist because you don't seem to be able to tolerate any other culture than your own in Denmark. You somehow think that different cultures are a threat to the stability of Denmark. You never mention the good in foreign cultures in Denmark. You have hardly said anything good about immigrants.

Breivik was an atheist (even if he sees himself as a ""cultural Christian"") yet he committed that atrocity. There have been so many mad people which have no relation to religion like Stalin and Mao. Any person who sympathies with the left are susceptible to communism which can lead to violent communism. Any nationalist is susceptible to extremist and hate towards minorities which can lead to violence (especially in situations where separatism is very strong). Many times these people are atheists, especially the former. The fact that you say that faith (especially Islam I suspect) is a gateway to madness is not very relevant considering there are so many other ways a person can be an extremist.

The Middle East is not in some type of crusade era. They haven't declared war on us. They don't care about land in Europe. Many of them see Israel as a holy land however this is a completely different question and the situation is extremely complicated. The majority has many times been involved in ""witch hunts"". It still happens today where many innocent Christians are killed in Muslim countries (a big reason we should accept refugees). Extremism and hate leads to these types of ""witch hunts"". In my opinion the most important message in religion is love. These people use religion as a tool to justify the killing of minorities.

Religious wars in Europe were also political wars. You can't deny that religion and politics in the past have gone hand in hand. The catholic church did not want to lose influence over northern Europe which become protestant. This is what many (but not all) religious wars are about.

&gt; Is that a reason to invite in more, or at least not try to combat extremism?

People are dying and getting tortured. You can have immigration and combat extremism. They are not mutually exclusive as nationalists like to think. As I said earlier education and tolerance is the key.

&gt; In the end cultural differences really do matter. It takes a lot longer for assimilation to happen if the parents cannot help, and it certainly does not help if the family has been forced into a ghetto due to a lack of assimilation of the parents in the first place. By simply churning people through an integration without bothering to have them assimilate into society you are setting them up to fail. You are not actually giving them a chance in hell to make a better life for themselves. Because culture does matter and it will always matter. That's reality.

Poverty forces immigrants to the ghettos. With better integration, not assimilation politics we can combat this. The children go to Danish schools, they learn Danish, they meet Danish people. The children many times have little to no connection to the country of their parents are from. They are automatically assimilated. The older they get and the better educated they get the faster they can leave the ghetto, like moving to student housing. As long as university is free poor people can attend and possibly improve their lives long term. The key is to combat poverty. I have no doubts that poor Danes who live in poor areas are more likely to commit crimes than the middle or high class even if they are from the same culture.

&gt; And how are they supposed to live normally like everybody else without any kind of assimilation into society? You're just setting them up to fail.

You expect assimilation. It's the Danish way or the highway. If they are integrated they function like everybody else. Maybe they don't celebrate Christmas and maybe they celebrate Ramadan instead, but that is not a problem and it is their business. As I said earlier their children will assimilate because they will see themselves as Danish or part Danish. Also it is not unlikely that assimilation will happen partially on its own because they are exposed to new culture. This is assuming they have been integrated.

&gt; And..? You seem to be missing a point there.

You don't understand my point. Many countries are indebted to help people from ex-colonies. There is a chance that they could have lead a normal life if there never was any Western interference. Maybe Sweden and Denmark not so much but the fact that Europe in whole got wealthier wasn't a disadvantage to us regarding trade.

&gt; So they are seeking asylum, and otherwise being too cowardly to resist.

If you were face torture or death then it is not cowardly to run away. You can't resist something like this on your own.

&gt; And I have no sympathy for these people. Look they're allowed to be here if they play by our rules and conform. I don't let strangers into my home without expecting them to obey my rules and conform to the household either. Denmark - as a nation - is not a charity, and think that is something you forget. It is a household.

Assimilation shouldn't be a requirement. Integration and functioning in society must happen. The analogy of letting strangers in your home is bad. You can't say you own an entire country like you own your house. Rich countries should help people who flee for their lives. I could never look into the eye of a person telling them they have to go home to their country to be tortured. In Sweden a requirement of not being rejected is that the person can't be sent back to a country where they will be tortured or killed.

Enormous.

I've read an interesting, well-documented literary project a few years ago. It's the ""Story of Seven Myths"" by Giorgos Katsimpardis (published in [2008](http://www.gbip.gr/book/132699)-[2009](http://www.gbip.gr/book/146719), not available in English yet). It seems that there is a pattern: most ancient Greek creators used 7 [archetypal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetypal_literary_criticism) myths in their works. Katsimpardis proves that 59 of the Classics fit this pattern.

Moving forward in time, the generations of Greeks that followed, and other people writing in Greek, expanded on this basis. People immersed in Greek culture can easily spot the parallels in modern works.

Since you mention the Odyssey, [there's a ""sequel""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey:_A_Modern_Sequel) by [Kazantzakis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Kazantzakis), one of the modern Greats.

Du kannst auch einfach sagen: Ich würde gern deutsch mit dir sprechen, damit ich es lerne. Jeder wird das verstehen und das dann auch machen. Wenn du etwas nicht verstehst, frag nach. Erst wenn du jemanden gar nicht verstehst, solltest du englisch mit ihm sprechen. Du musst am Anfang nicht so viel Rücksicht auf die Leute nehmen, weil es wichtig ist, dass du die Sprache lernst.

Zur Kultur: In Bayern gibt es sehr starke Traditionen, vielen Menschen ist ihre Heimat und Kultur sehr wichtig. Lies ein wenig über die Geschichte von Bayern (zum Beispiel auf Wikipedia). Besuch einen Biergarten und versuch mit den Menschen zu sprechen (hier ist deutsch sehr wichtig). Geh in Museen und zu Konzerten. Besuch Bars, Clubs und Kneipen. Rede mit so vielen Menschen wie möglich. Du hast einen großen Vorteil, weil du aus den USA kommst. Die meisten jungen Menschen werden dich allein deswegen interessant finden und gerne mit dir sprechen. Am besten kannst du die Kultur kennen lernen, wenn du sie lebst.

A sinistra è diverso: l'opzione listone al Senato era stata considerata ma, esattamente come avvenne con l'Unione nel 2006, alla fine si è deciso di andare in coalizione anche lì. Il motivo è, in sostanza, che a Vendola così conviene di più: il 20% necessario alla coalizione per entrare in Senato non è in discussione, e a quel punto tanto vale provare a fare l'8% in un numero di regioni bastanti a dare un totale di venti senatori. Quota venti è vitale perché tanti sono i senatori necessari a farsi il gruppo parlamentare autonomo (con i benefici materiali e non che ne conseguono).

Exports to Euro-zone are easier (our main exporting market, or should we say the Euro-zone is a domestic market?), work mobility within the zone is easier, but the best and most important thing is, we HAVE to have a working economy! We all can agree, I think, that the implementation of the Euro was poorly done. But I don't believe anyone who at least is macro-economical educated (is this even a thing?) will say that it didn't good for the countries (low interest rates on loans). Again, the situation the whole zone is in at the moment was made possible by how it was implemented. What I mean by this is lack of fiscal union. But now, with the steps being made by the European Commission and the European Council towards said union I don't see something like this happening again (to elaborate, I think it wont happen again because I truly believe this is the first steps to a full pledge federalization of the EU).

Just taking on this.

Churchill: 
&gt;We must build a kind of United States of Europe. In this way only will hundreds of millions of toilers be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make life worth living.

And him again:

&gt;We see nothing but good and hope in a richer, freer, more contented European commonality. But we have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it. We are linked but not compromised. We are interested and associated but not absorbed.

He was in favour of a Federal Europe, just thought the UK had no place in it. But this proves nothing so, I give you...

*The Solemn Declaration on European Union* signed in 1985, the UK entered the EEC in 1973:

&gt;The Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the European Communities meeting within the European Council resolved to continue the work begun on the basis of the Treaties of Paris and Rome and to create a united Europe, which is more than ever necessary in order to meet the dangers of the world situation, capable of assuming the responsibilities incumbent on it by virtue of its political role, its economic potential and its manifold links with other peoples, [...]
The Heads of State or Government, on the basis of an awareness of a common destiny and the wish to affirm the European identity, confirm their commitment to progress towards an ever closer union among the peoples and Member States of the European Community.

The Treaty of the European Union AKA the Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992. This is plenty of time to opt-out. But maybe the UK was forced to get on board with this since it was already in before there was even a hint of federalization. But now I'll give you...

Jean Monnet on the European Coal and Steel Community (pre EEC):

&gt;Through the consolidation of basic production and the institution of a new High Authority, whose decisions will bind France, Germany and the other countries that join, this proposal represents the first concrete step towards a European federation, imperative for the preservation of peace.

And yet again, but this time still during the war:

&gt;There will be no peace in Europe, if the states are reconstituted on the basis of national sovereignty... The countries of Europe are too small to guarantee their peoples the necessary prosperity and social development. The European states must constitute themselves into a federation...

This is where I'll take the time to remember you that Monnet was behind the creation of the ECSC and EEC. To the point that the EEC wasn't the only community that was going to be created, there was also a political and a defence community, but then the defence one failed to pass on the French parliament he resigned from the High Authority and focused on the economic one.

What I mean by this is, claiming ignorance of what this was from the start either means that your politicians lied to you, or that your politicians were incredibly incompetent. In either case this means they should have never been your leaders. On the other hand, they might have never lied to you and knew all along what this was, but they just wanted to get the max out of it while it was possible. If this is the case, kudos, but now might be the time to leave. We all got a lot from it, no hard feelings. Just don't say that the UK didn't knew what this was from the start.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;You're happy with the fact that the European Court of Auditors – the EU’s auditors – refused to sign off on how Brussels’ budget was spent for 17 years in a row?

I don't know what you're talking about.

&gt;You say you don't blindly accept but the fact remains that we all have whilst the EU budget gets higher and higher - even in times of austerity.

I agree with you, we shouldn't be increasing spending now.

&gt;just remember that when the UK joined it wasn't the EU, just the EEC, which was basically a customs union

Yes.

&gt;No one knew what direction it was going to take

What? The British people joined the EEC in 1973 and two years later even decided with a clear majority on referendum to remain in it.

The EEC itself was established with the Treaty of Rome, the direction the EEC was going to take couldn't be clearer, it's in the very first line, ""[an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe](http://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Feconomy_finance%2Femu_history%2Fdocuments%2Ftreaties%2Frometreaty2.pdf&amp;ei=vs7uUL_9B9SAhQeypYH4Bw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFl3tEWSEsI32VJcyE7u31btqT7pA&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.ZG4)"".

&gt;it's not just the UK who gets exemptions and doesn't want the Euro

Sure, you're absolutely right. It's the same with every governing body, though, just like there are countries which don't agree with what's decided in Brussels, there are regions in the UK that don't agree to what's decided in Westminster.

I personally don't think this is reason enough for the UK to leave the EU or for some part of the UK to leave the Union as in both cases, there's still democratic representation, but then again, it's not up to me to decide anything, if the UK does decide to leave the EU or if some part of the UK decides to secede, that's up to them, I guess.

&gt;There's no simple list which shows what countries are exempt from the various rules and regulations that the EU passes, but suffice to say that if there was such a list there it wouldn't be just the UK on it.

Again, you're absolutely right, but the point I'm trying to make is that the EU's interests are the interests of all of us - the UK is also part of the EU, the UK also benefits from the EU.",0,1357828710,null,0,false,0,c7ufmps,t3_1680ev,t1_c7ufmps,t1_c7uew1p,null,1430915884,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Vor 30 Jahren gab es auch schon solche Poster, Videos und Infoveranstaltungen. Seit über 10 Jahren gibt es den Girlsday bei der Bundeswehr. Ich war 4 Jahre Zeitsoldat und unser Batallion hat jedes Jahr im Sommer einen Tag der offenen Tür veranstaltet. Da konnten Kinder mit im Panzer fahren, in LKWs rumklettern und Waffen anschauen. 

Ist es jetzt verwerflich, dass die Bundeswehr mit der Zeit geht und das Internet verwendet? Der Artikel klingt so als wolle die Bundeswehr Kindersoldaten wie in Afrika anwerben. Die Kampagnen sind aber eher auf 16-18jährige ausgelegt und die sollten schon wissen was ein Soldat ist. Und wenn nicht sollten die Eltern ihren Kindern das erklären. 

&gt;""Man gewinnt auf der Seite leicht den Eindruck, das soldatische Leben sei vor allem geprägt von sportlichen Übungen, Gemeinschaftsleben, dem Bedienen und Reparieren von nichtalltäglichen Maschinen und - zugespitzt formuliert - der Realisierung der eigenen militärischen Karriere"", resümiert Vogel.

Und als ehemaliger Zeitsoldat kann ich mit Fug und Recht behaupten, dass dieses Bild der Realität entspricht.
99% der Truppe wird niemals mit Bomben, Kampf und Tod in Kontakt kommen. Und selbst im Einsatz ist das sehr selten der Fall. Ich war selber 2002 als Gebirgsjäger in Afghanistan und habe weder Tod noch Kampf erlebt. Ich war die meiste Zeit im Camp, durfte nur selten nach Kabul in die Stadt und hab mich 90% der Zeit gelangweilt. Soll die Bundeswehr dafür Werbung machen? ""Langweile dich im Camp Warehouse mit 2000 anderen Soldaten aus aller Welt!""

Die Bundeswehr ist entgegen der öffentlichen Meinung in unseren Medien kein Offensivheer. Klar gab es schon Tote in Kampfhandlungen, aber jedes Jahr sterben mehr Soldaten im Dienst in Dtl. durch Unfälle als in Afghanistan. Außerdem ist es nicht so, dass die Soldaten zum Einsatz gezwungen werden. Jeder Soldat sucht sich seine Truppengattung und Verwendung selber raus. Wer zum KSK oder den Fallschirmjägern geht, muss damit rechnen, dass er in den Kampfeinsatz kommt. Es gibt genug andere Verwendungen bei denen man niemals in Kampfhandlungen verwickelt wird.

No. The issue is the quality of the immigrants. Its FAR harder to immigrate to America than to immigrate into Sweden from Somalia (both distance and more strict immigration regulations are the cause), and this acts as a filter so the quality of Somali immigrants is simply not comparable. In addition, America has far less generous welfare system so the incentive to work instead of staying on welfare is greater (but this is not the way Sweden wants to go).

Its pretty naive to think that you can cut unemployment by tens of % by estabshing some ""African development center"" (another government expense by the way).

true,NuclearWookie,null,null,"&gt;That addresses Lenninism and Trotskyism as opposed to libertarian socialism/communism and the unholy alliance of Eastern and Western propaganda machines on pretending the USSR was socialist.

Despite Chomsky's excuses and your No True Scotsman, the USSR was a valid attempt at socialism. That other attempts have gone down exactly the same way only further substantiates the conclusion that all real-world attempts at socialism will proceed exactly as those in the past have.

&gt;Then, rather than post it all again, here's a link to a post where I made about how much ""socialism"" there actually was in the Soviet Union.

Linking to a statement by yourself is poor form. Your attempts to conflate the USSR with capitalism have already been noted and dismissed, why would you think another dose of the same nonsense might go down more easily?

&gt;Having said that, I note both that you're focusing on authoritarian ""socialist"" States rather than considering those few and fairly short libertarian experiments that there have been - anarchist Catalonia, free Ukraine, and that you seem to forget that the definition of communism is a classless, moneyless, Stateless society.

That society can never be achieved, as all past experiments with socialism have demonstrated. A government is necessary to forbid people from acting as they would naturally: to better themselves and the lot of their progeny. Any form of anarchic socialism would immediately be ruined by assholes like me. 

You've created a society without government and without class? Have you made all resources on the globe infinite yet? Nope? I guess I will be hoarding and selling caviar. Without a government to stop me there's no way to prevent the system from being wrecked. A government is necessary, even if you don't want to admit it. And that government will necessarily be totalitarian. 

&gt;Why is it artificial? If you work, you're a worker.

But my interests aren't in line with, say, those of a janitor or garbageman. You've grouped me and all other people into this one category and are pretending we'll all benefit from the changes that would come in a revolution. While we all work, we have very little in common beyond that. 

&gt;The Enclosure Acts were an important component of primitive accumulation, just as the homesteading provisions in the US were; ALEC is evidence that the ""conspiracy"" as you've chosen to label it between corporations/capitalists/the ruling elite (choose your own terminology) and government to create a legal, political and social framework where workers are coerced into unfavourable employment conditions is an ongoing project.

You're think I'm being disingenuous while claiming that a group of Americans in 1975 got into a time machine and lobbied Parliament to pass the Enclosure Acts? I'm sorry, but the existence of that organization does nothing to back up your conspiracy theory.

&gt; It was just an obvious and current one I thought you might be familiar with.

And, due to the nature of causality, it is completely irrelevant to the claim you were attempting to substantiate. 

&gt;I really can't be arsed to take this any further with you because you're clearly just into throwing around insults because you can't debate your corner.

Calling you on your lies is not an insult. You've repeatedly misused words with very clear definitions in an attempt to sell your ideology. When asked to substantiate your rhetoric, you've backpedaled and handwaved in an attempt to change the subject. You've completely failed to demonstrate any form of coercion or slavery in the current economic system of Europe. In other words, you're lying pretty much constantly.

&gt;Dunno about where you live, but land with planning permission (another example of artificial scarcity to keep workers in line) is outrageous in the UK. The cost of construction/the building(s) is less significant in comparison. So, GBP4-10k per acre versus GBP200k per acre.

It is much cheaper where I live. Your logic assumes that the person wishing to escape society is trapped in his come country and unable to leave. This isn't the case. UK citizens can easily move to Canada, Australia, or any other sparsely-populated Commonwealth nation where land is cheap. The option exists.

&gt;Can't imperialist monarchies be capitalist?

Capitalism involves the a voluntary exchange. A king coming in with an army and slaughtering natives is not a voluntary exchange.

&gt;Not by any stretch.

Why not? Most of the deaths resulted from the participation of a socialist nation which had just finished gang-banging Poland with the help of another socialist nation. Hell, the vast majority of deaths of combat troops were the direct result of the callous disregard for life employed by the USSR.

&gt;It's pretty clear to me. You're just acting like the Stalin deniers did in the last century. When it's all over, people will look back at people like you, apologists for the horrors of capitalism, aghast.

Some how I doubt that. Capitalism has raised the standard of living of people to levels that would be godlike in other societies. Capitalism put men on the moon, decoded the human genome, and split the atom while nations under the yoke of socialism wallowed, stagnated, and starved.

That's because worker control is an idiotic idea. To the credit of the slavers in charge, this was realized in short order and fixed.

Adăugăm la asta faptul că [DEX '98, NODEX și mai ales DER](http://dexonline.ro/definitie/baros) dau ca etimologie limba țigănească și cuvântul țigănesc „baro” (mare) - iar barosul e „un ciocan mare”, e foarte probabil ca aia să fie etimologia.

To make this clear, I was talking about French law (because /u/Haaveilla has a French flag as flair so I assumed by ""here"" he meant ""France""), so, yes, civil law, and only one very particular instance of civil law.  Also, I did not say the reason one can't refuse the high-denomination bills is simply because they're legal tender.  (Perhaps the legal reasoning would be something more complicated like this: I demand to buy some service or good, the merchant can't refuse to give it to me because it was publicly advertised, and now I have a debt so to settle and now they can't refuse my money because it's legal tender.)

Some sources on my claim: [here](http://www.banque-france.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/banque_de_france/billets_et_pieces/note138.pdf) is a brochure by the Banque de France where the before-last question on page 8 clearly states that, no, one can't put up a sign saying that bills of 100€ or more are not accepted; they quote [article R642-3](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000022375969&amp;idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006165439&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20130110) of the French penal code which makes it a contravention to ""refuse to receive"" coins or bills having legal tender (it does not specifically say, to settle a debt).  And [here](http://www.senat.fr/questions/base/2000/qSEQ00050820S.html) is a question asked to a government official by a French senator precisely about shopkeepers who refuse high-denomination bills: both the senator and the minister agree that this is illegal (because of the above-quoted article).",0,1357838147,null,0,false,0,c7uic3z,t3_16b4d8,t1_c7uic3z,t1_c7uhov3,null,1430917352,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Living is rather expensive, but if you can get a room from the Studentenwerk, you should be fine. It's also fairly common to room together, you might wanna look out for temporary living arrangements on sites like [these:] (http://www.wg-gesucht.de/) It's rather hard to find an affordable appartment for just yourself, especially when you're not staying that long... Lots of students look for one- or two-room-apartments and there are just very, very few to be found.

Regarding food, eating out in Bonn is probably on the same level as a regular Western German city. You can get a small beer from 1-3 €, depending on the place. There quite a few cheap and good places to grab food, my favorite Asian restaurant had a complete and yummy meal for only 4,20 €.

Bonn's nickname is ""Bundesstadt Ohne Nennenswertes Nachtleben"", jokingly stating that the clubbing scene is rather... simple. However, there are a few cozy bars and especially the Altstadt district attracts students that can't spend too much money on a beer. Luckily, Colonge is nearby and you can get there on your student ticket easily.

Since Bonn ist very popular for international students, I imagine that the experience they already have will come in handy for you. I didn't study in Bonn myself, but my husband did.

Mostly I buy noodles, rice, potatoes and cook something with it. Also, you will have the possibility to go to the ""Mensa"" (Cafeteria) at Uni Bonn. There you can eat usually between 2,20 - 4€ (depends if you buy something to drink)

Bonn is compared to Köln a rather small city but has a good student live. There are lots of German breweries and pubs and you can drink the typical Kölsch (1,20-1,50€ per glas). If you into real electronic music and a good nightligfe, Colgone is only a 30 minutes train ride away. Moreover, you don't have to pay for the ticket since you will get a ""Semesterticket"" which allows you to take all trains and public transport over North Rhine Westphalia (the state were Bonn is in).

In short: I live in Cologne. Pay 320€ rent and need for living (food, partying, clothes etc.) between 500-600€. Also, Bonn is a good place for Erasmus.",0,1357840611,null,0,false,0,c7uj6jb,t3_16bnk8,t1_c7uj6jb,t3_16bnk8,null,1430917773,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

I see this point raised a lot on reddit, and I don't think its very valid. For one thing, only a small minority of the anti-Soviet Mujahideen went on to become the Taliban or al-Qaeda. The officer corps of the modern Afghan National Army, for example, is largely made up of men who fought the Soviets. 

&gt;It does not matter how good the intentions are. Such blunders always create problems in the long run. International relations are not a chess game. There are always complications that we overlook.

I agree that international relations are complicated and that states sometimes hurt themselves with foolish attempts at intrigue. However this is quite a straightforward situation, the government of Mali isn't some sketchy armed militia. It's your average (i.e. fairly dysfunctional) central African government, and its territory is being usurped by hyper-extremist militants. From purely a human rights standpoint European nations providing training and assistance is justified due to the atrocities which the rebels are perpetrating in the areas they've conquered.

Mostly old ladies do.

The thing is, for some reason, French banks aren't allowed to take a fee on checks (it's strange because they seem to be able to put one on every single other means of payment), so they try to discourage their use but of course it doesn't work very well.

I still use them very rarely.  Basically the only checks I write are when I see my doctors (some doctors take the credit card\[#\] but not all do) and when I receive a parcel delivered at home by UPS and have to pay custom duties.

Traditionally they represent a smaller fraction of German population (average below 10%, mostly rich and/or businessmen ). They have a long tradition of being part of a government (entirely since 1949: except 66-69, and 98-09) and formed coalitions with both, conservative and labour (mostly conservative though)

About 10 y ago they gained extreme popularity outside their prime clientele, with a campaign based on tax-reduction and amusement. They also tried some [xenophobic and antisemitic flyers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jürgen_Möllemann) to reach new voters. Eventually they narrowed their campaign to a simply *all taxes down* message, which brought them 14% support in the last election 2009 - It was the best result in history and they entered the government with quite some self-esteem. 

Since then they constantly disappoint traditional and new voters:

 * The taxes couldn't be reduced for all, due to the economic situation (which they could have known beforehand). In the views of their voters, they broke a promise.
 * So they reduced the taxed for their prime clientele (hotel owners) only, This was disproved by the majority of Germans. Most observers saw another broken promise, as the FDP originally wanted an easier and fair balanced system. 
 * The responsible politicians acted unprofessional on many occasions (e.g. the [foreign minister during the Libya crisis two years ago](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/19/libya-germany-westerwelle-idAFLDE72I0AE20110319) , ... ). Rivalries within the party destroy further credibility. 
 * Neo-liberal thinking was not en-vogue any longer. Merkel took the chance to raise her own popularity. In many fields her politics are against FDP principals (e.g. government support for renewable energy). This make the FDP politicians look even less assertive and more power-addicted.

Err, you do realize that the USA didn't start the war right? Trust me when I say that US funds are definitely not needed for a country to be awash with small arms. This has nothing to do with western involvement.

&gt;So if France builds up something similar in Mali, and the Jihadis win 20 years from now, what will happen? Taliban does not exist in a vaccum. They buy weapons from the same place where mujahiddin bought it, and they use the same vehicles that were shipped in for them. Look up Stinger missiles in hands of these Jihadis for an even more egregious mistake of USA.

Well for one thing Stingers won't work 20 years later, or even 5. All heat seeking MANPADS have batteries in the seeker heads which wear out after a few years. And I think its silly to claim that the USA is responsible for the weapons in Afghanistan, the Soviets shipped in millions of weapons and tens of millions of rounds of ammunition, much of which was lost, stolen or sold on the black market. 

&gt;In other words I am asking what happens if France establishes a weapon supply chain, and then 10-20 years down the line the Jihadis win. That is what happened in Afghanistan. Without the weapons industry the taliban would have very little power.

This argument makes no sense whatsoever. The militants in Mali clearly have an adequate supply of weaponry already, since they've taken over much of the country. And the Malian government doesn't need weapons, they have plenty of those. What they need from France is help in training and organizing their forces in order to deploy the weapons they already have effectively. 

&gt;The Belgian withdrew, but If something similar were done to French soldiers, then you will suddenly find the peaceful mission turning into another just combat mission. History is testament to it.

Its highly unlikely that this would happen to French soldiers, especially after the lessons learned from the disastrous ambush in Afghanistan. Furthermore the mission would involve training, as I've said repeatedly, not peace enforcement, so French troops likely wouldn't find themselves in any danger, apart from possible suicide attacks on the Malian bases where they'll be staying. But they certainly won't be at risk of capture.

&gt;Perhaps you are talking about what happens when things go according to plan, and I am talking about what happens when shit hits the fan.

That's a dumb way of looking at it. The right approach to tackling a problem is to do everything in your power to make sure that everything goes well, rather than automatically assuming that everything will go to shit at the first chance.

true,Silly_Crotch,FRAN,LA FRAAAAAAANCE,"Nothing for France ? I guess I have to do it then. Obviously it's entirely subjective and does not even begin to cover everything. I start at the enlightenment because if I don't it will never end.

* [Candide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide), by Voltaire (1759). I guess you could pick any philosophical novel, but this is probably the funniest and the most famous. It's a great example of Enlightenment philosophy too.

* [Les Liaisons Dangereuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Liaisons_dangereuses), by Choderlos de Laclos (1782) certainly is one of the first modern novels and an excellent illustration of libertine thinking.

* [Le Rouge et le Noir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Rouge_et_le_Noir), by Stendhal (1830). Stendhal is certainly one of the first who really developed his characters' psychology. Also pokes great fun at the Bourbon monarchy. 

* [Les Misérables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables) by Victor Hugo (1862). Obviously incredibly important in French literature and society. A book about the lower classes for the lower classes. The recent movie is an utter disgrace though.

* [Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea) by Jules Verne (1870) is one of the first popular science fiction books. Verne wrote a ton of books but this is my favorite. It's often framed as children literature, but I'd argue it's actually really well written with a meaningful subtext.

During the 20th century, I'd say 

* [In Search of Lost Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time) by Proust (1912 - 27). It took me years to read it, honestly, but what a shock when you manage to do so. I think we're still underestimating Proust's impact on world literature. 

* [Journey to the End of Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_End_of_the_Night) by Céline (1932) is an incredible reading experience. Also a great portrayal of post-war colonial France. Really makes you want to puke at times, it stays with you for a long time.

* [Nausea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea_(novel\)) by Jean-Paul Sartre (1938) tells you everything you want to know about existentialism in one novel. For more fun, read Sartre's autobiography and reflexions on literature, [The Words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Words_(book\)) (1963).

* [The Stranger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_(novel\)) by Albert Camus (1942). If you haven't read it, do so. Only takes a few hours, changes your world.

* [Froth on the Daydream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froth_on_the_Daydream) by Boris Vian (1947) is a great love story, very sad (it's French...) but also surrealist and very fun.

It's certainly harder to compile something for recent years... This is where it becomes very subjective. I'd say Marguerite Yourcenar, Eugène Ionesco, Julien Gracq, Saint-John Perse and François Mauriac are really important.

In living authors, Marie NDiaye certainly has something. Le Clézio got the Nobel but I don't really like him that much. Michel Houellebecq is hit or miss, and for me it's always been miss. I like Jonathan Littell, who is French-American and writes in French. Amin Maalouf too. Yasmina Khadra certainly wrote some good stuff. It's really too much, sorry!

Oh, and I only mentioned fiction. here are three nonfiction books that changed a ton of things, check them out:

* Pascal's [Pensées](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pens%C3%A9es) (1669). Bim bam philosophy.

* [The Social Contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Social Contract) by Rousseau (1762). There is a before and an after The Social Contract. Really changed the way we think about society, politics, etc.

* [The Code Civil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Civil) (1804). And Napoléon gave us the law. Huge influence all over Europe (except in Britain, but you know how they are..)

Und wenn die Sonne mal in ganz Deutschland scheint, dann gibt es nicht genügend Verbraucher und wir müssen unsere Energie ins Ausland abschieben, dass unser Netz nicht überlastet. Dies führt dann halt schon dazu, dass Ausländische Netzbetreiber das verhindern wollen, da sie auch zu diesem Zeitpunkt wenig mit der Energie anfangen können (z.B. ist die Spizenlast im Verbrauch ja morgens, während noch kaum Sonne scheint, während Mittags eher weniger Strom verbraucht wird, obwohl nun die Sonne perfekt für die Energiegewinnung steht). Da Kohle-/Kernkraftwerke auch nicht so schnell mal einfach abgeschaltet werden können, sondern dafür mehrere Stunden brauchen (Deswegen werden sie auch zur Grundlastversorgung eingesetzt), ist es auch schwer, plötzliche Energiespitzen aus den erneuerbaren Energien auszugleichen.

This siege actually happened and many of the characters are historical figures.
* [Molnár Ferenc - A Pál utcai fiúk (The Paul Street Boys)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paul_Street_Boys), pretty interesting book about kids fighting wars between each other
* Arany János - Toldi, it's a rather long poem (something like 50 pages long?) about a hero named Toldi and his adventures, set in the XIV century

There are other books which I like but they're not really recognized as being ""among the best"". One is ""[The invisible man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_of_the_Huns)"" by Gárdonyi Géza, it's about a Greek/Roman slave that goes to live with the Huns during Attila's reign, how he falls in love with a girl and then the Hunnic lifestyle etc. Something like Dances with wolves except this was written a 100 years before the movie.

The weirdest short stories I've ever read in any language were by [Csáth Géza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9za_Cs%C3%A1th), he was a morphium addict, shot his wife, then tried to run away but eventually died. Reading his stories is like watching Eraserhead, enough said.

* Mihail Neamțu (founding member of the FCD) was a neonazi in his young days, he claims now that he was just young and foolish, but he occasionally does touch his old ideas; last thing was a couple of months when he caused quite a fuss from the Jewish organizations after quoting a fascist poet; Neamțu was also active countering what he calls the ""gay agenda"" (a term probably borrowed from the US) and he often repeated how disgusted he is when he sees gays kissing on the street in Germany or the gay pride parade in Bucharest.

Die können sich zurücklehnen und abwarten. Entweder gibt die GEMA kleinbei, oder der Volkszorn fegt sie hinweg. Wäre einerseits nett. 

Wenn sich dann andererseits Hinterhoflabel Bielefeld GmbH mit Google anlegen soll, bekommen die, die die Musik machen, mit Sicherheit keinen Pfennig mehr.

&gt; PSY ... der wird nicht einmal wissen, dass es so einen Verein namens Gema in Deutschland gibt

Genausowenig wie er weiß, wie genau sein Einkommen aus Aserbaidschan zustande kommt. Natürlich ist es lächerlich, daß er in Deutschalnd auf youtube nicht offiziell zu sehen ist. 

---

&gt; Finde den Fehler.  

Bloß weil die GEMA den Kopf noch im Arsch vom letzten Jahrhundert hat, ist ""Abschaffen und Google mal machen lassen"" auch nicht die beste Lösung.

I definitely think it's great to have denominations like that, but like you, I am filled with immense dread at the idea of carrying around a note that'll feel like a metric ton in your pocket.

Another thing. The advantage of this denomination is also that you don't really rely on fractional currencies like pennies, because the minted metal will be worth more than its denominational value.

The only Danish fractional denomination is a 50-ører coin (~£0.075). And you'll rarely get to see it. I love that prices are always integers, wherever I shop.

The euro sucks in this regard, because of how you need coins with values that are ridiculously low (1c, £0.008, 0.075 DKK!), because it covers countries with incredibly different economies.

I think *pence* make your money seem less desirable. ;)

&gt; The country was relatively prosperous and its leaders believed the gypsy problem is merely social. They did believe that if they provide them with jobs and their children will have to attend schools everything will eventually turn to better.

Recognizing a social problem, and then failing to solve it (a chronic issue in socialist states — the primary reason they failed, in fact), does not mean it isn't a social issue. It just means they failed to solve it. :)

&gt; the parents didn't value education at all

If you'll allow it, I want to focus on this particular point. I want to argue that we see the same behavioral patterns among any group of people that doesn't have an appreciation for education, be it religious, cultural, or ethnic group.

There are tons of poor white people, and I grew up around some of them. My parents aren't well educated, but they always valued education and taught me the value of it, and while I was being read nighttime stories from a book, other kids barely even saw a book before coming to school. And the parents never took any interest in their child's education.

Today these people are on government welfare or working low-paying jobs. Gypsy or no gypsy, lack of interest in education is a social problem that must be solved — and I really don't know how. Economic incentives don't seem to work (they're already in place — higher education generally gives high-paying jobs).

Now, among gypsies, it wouldn't surprise me if there are multiple factors at play — one is a widespread disregard for education, another is general distrust of mainstream society, and yet another is utter poverty.

A bit further down the same article:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language#French_and_Italian_words

&gt;Since the 19th century, many modern words were borrowed from the other Romance languages, especially from French and Italian (for example: birou ""desk, office"", avion ""airplane"", exploata ""exploit""). It was estimated that about 38% of the number of words in Romanian are of French and/or Italian origin (in many cases both languages); and adding this to the words that were inherited from Latin, about 75%-85% of Romanian words can be traced to Latin. The use of these Romanianized French and Italian loanwords has tended to increase at the expense of Slavic loanwords, many of which have become rare or fallen out of use. 

&gt;In fact if I remember well, Romanian is the closest Romance language to vulgar Latin.

Well, Romanian is conservative in some aspects, but the most conservative afaik is [Sardinian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_language). [Again](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language#Historical_grammar):

&gt;Romanian has preserved a part of the Latin declension, but whereas Latin had six cases, from a morphological viewpoint Romanian has only three: the nominative-accusative, the genitive-dative, and marginally the vocative. Romanian nouns also preserve the neuter gender, although instead of functioning as a separate gender with its own forms in adjectives, the Romanian neuter became a mixture of masculine and feminine.

Germany's desire for austerity in Greece has strength. Whilst its being recommended, it isn't being implemented very strongly, which has unfortunately led to more criticism of the policy in general. Take a comparison against Latvia, who implemented austerity in the state sector to cut spending thus allowing them to dramatically reduce their budget deficit. They are recovering very well. Greece on the other hand has laboured towards austerity amidst often violent protests against it.

Curbing tax evasion, reducing corruption as much as possible and reducing state expenditure (especially in a country that has been repeatedly bailed out in the past) would significantly help Greece's recovery and prevent this happening again.

I don't really know.  It's pretty stupid.

(I never even really understood why certain doctors are allowed to charge more.)  There are also rules on how you get your appointment: to be fully reimbursed if you see a specialist you have to first consult another doctor (typically a GP, although it can be another specialist or even the same specialist on a previous visit) and be ""referred"" to the specialist.  So I guess all this extra complication means there are a lot of rules to be checked, but now that it's all computerized there's no reason it couldn't be done on the spot.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; 51% of EU citizens can converse in English, and that number is rising rapidly.

I'd say that's a surprisingly low number, actually. And it says nothing of non-EU European countries, which I suspect wouldn't really pull the statistic up.

&gt; Over 90% of people can speak fluent English in 4 countries outside of Ireland and the UK already, and as I say, that's rapidly rising.

Where are you getting that statistic? Some of the best non-native English-speaking countries in EU are Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark, and for all of those, the English conversational capability percentage is in the 70s or 80s. And that's nowhere near *fluent*, I might add. Fluency is always difficult to define, but I'll tell you this: Young people in Denmark can definitely converse in English, and you'll have no trouble interacting with them socially, but they *will* have frequent pauses, awkward sentence structures and unexpected word choices when they're venturing into more complex language use. I don't even care about things like accent, as long as it isn't too strong to be intelligible, but it's still not what I would call ""fluent"".

And yes, this is even among the academic class. I've had classes taught to me in various subject (Computer Science and Liberal Arts, respectively) by Danish people in English, and the experience varies from mediocre over laughable to downright cringing. And I've heard people complain that all of our texts were in English, because it took them longer to read them, and there were many words and idioms they didn't understand without looking them up.

This is the level exhibited by non-native English-speakers who were brought up with the *closest possible* (with the exception of Finland, which indeed has a lower percentage) native languages to English there are: the North Germanic family of languages, and from relatively small countries that have historically been very influenced by anglophone media (primarily American as a result of the Marshall Plan). 

All in all, be careful not to overplay the prevalence of English in Europe. It is significantly harder for people from different linguistic backgrounds to learn than the ones you pose as examples, and it would be extremely foolish of the British to think that learning English is ""enough"" if they want to speak with anyone else.

If you're a tourist and you speak english you're set, if you're a business man and you speak english you're set, the internet is in english, what else can one say?


There was a thread posted here some weeks ago about almost 80 percent of the european languages slowly disappearing on the internet and that will remain true as more people start to migrate to bigger international websites, even if they do use it localised, this is making small country specific websites slowly disappear. At least from europe, obviously this won't affect places like China with their RenRen instead of FB and etc, etc. But how big can an online business get if it offers only one language that is spoken by a country or two?

English is not the future, in my opinion now people start looking at learning Chinese, that seems like the future. If you ask businessmen and with the not so new influx of chinese tourists who spend a lot of money in europe people who speak chinese are highly sought after by businesses. English should be already a standard. This is just a pointless argument, whoever says otherwise is behind.

He was very moderate. I do think he would be a good symbol of Europe. The only problem is that he's French, so his image naturally excludes everyone who isn't French, and while he's famous outside France, he's still an obscure figure for most non-French Europeans who may just have heard his name here and there.

She had actually sued her father for libel because in his ""autobiography"" he had hinted at incest, but it didn't become more than a rumour because the whole book is apparently full of deliberately outrageous tall (sex) tales.

As quoted [here](http://www.avmaniacs.com/forums/showthread.php?t=46258&amp;page=1):

&gt;  This rumor [that Klaus abused his daughter Nastassja] started from an on set quote spoken to William Malone while working on the movie CREATURE aka TITAN FIND. Malone tells the story in the book GODS IN SPANDEX and has told it in plenty of other interviews. He said on the very first day on set Kinski walked up to him, put his arm around him and and said to him quietly ""You should know I fucked my Nastassja when she was twelve"" in an attempt to get a reaction from him. Malone said after the second day of shooting with him the only way he could direct the man was to scream at him. 

Also from the same thread:

&gt;  If you read Werner Herzog's Conquest of the Useless (AMAZING book by the way) chronicling the making of Fitzcaraldo via Herzog's journal during the shoot. Herzog does confirm the story of Klaus fucking Nastassja and his other daughter Pola with much remorse in his tone. He also mentions Kinski beating his first wife at the hotel he stayed in during the shooting of Aguirre.

true,bonzinip,lombardia,,"Provo io. La legge elettorale funziona così: ci sono un certo numero di liste che presentano un programma e propongono un nome per il presidente del Consiglio. Per cominciare, bisogna notare che il nome del presidente del Consiglio è puramente indicativo; alla fine è il presidente della Repubblica a sceglierlo dopo aver consultato i partiti.

Le liste possono essere di due tipi: organizzate in una coalizione (ovvero due liste presentano lo stesso programma e propongono lo stesso presidente), o ""non collegate"". Non c'è nessun collegamento tra Camera e Senato. È possibile (e anche normale) che qualcuno si presenti solo in uno dei due rami, o che più liste si presentino come coalizione alla Camera e come un unica lista non collegata al Senato (anche il contrario, ma sarebbe quasi suicida per via degli sbarramenti: ora ci arrivo).

Il sistema prevede che la Val d'Aosta abbia elezioni sostanzialmente separate (è troppo piccola e con il sistema proporzionale non avrebbe in sostanza nessuna rappresentanza), e c'è qualche complicazione anche in Trentino Alto-Adige per il Senato. Per le altre regioni è proporzionale sia alla Camera che al Senato, e molto simile per le due camere con una importante differenza. È questa differenza, di cui parlerò dopo a rendere i risultati della Camera una ""porcata"", e quelli del Senato un gran casino.

Parto dalla Camera. Una volta arrivato il numero dei voti, prima di tutto viene calcolato lo sbarramento. Se una lista non collegata non arriva al 4%, i suoi voti è come se non esistessero.  Idem per una lista che è parte di una coalizione, se questa coalizione non arriva al 10%. Se ci arriva, per salvarsi basta arrivare al 2% o essere la ""migliore perdente"" della coalizione. C'è un'altra clausola per salvare liste che si siano presentate solo in Trentino Alto-Adige e Friuli, non entro nei dettagli.

Per calcolare chi prende i seggi, prima di tutto questi vengono ripartiti considerando le coalizioni come un'entità unica. Ad esempio se si prende il 40%, avrai 617*40% = 246 deputati (617 = 630 deputati - 1 per la Val d'Aosta - 12 per l'estero). Siccome ho scartato 0,8 deputati, non riuscirò ad assegnare tutti e 630 i seggi, quindi riprendo l'elenco delle liste e assegno quelli che mancano a chi aveva la parte decimale più alta.

Poi assegno il premio di maggioranza a chi ha preso più voti: questo si becca sempre almeno 340 deputati. Se ne aveva di meno, gliene do 340 e ricalcolo i 617-340=277 seggi di tutte le altre liste/coalizioni nello stesso modo.

A questo punto calcolo i seggi che vanno alle liste che fanno parte di una coalizione, con un ""proporzionale nel proporzionale"". Solito metodo: se ho preso il 40% dei voti di lista, e mi sono stati assegnati 200 deputati, io ne prendo 80.

Ora bisogna decidere chi viene eletto, e ammetto che non ho idea di come funzioni. Il territorio nazionale è diviso in 27 circoscrizioni, e in ciascuna viene presentato un elenco di candidati. Se un eletto è presente in più circoscrizioni, può scegliere da quale far venire il suo seggio. La cosa importante è che le liste sono ""bloccate"": decidono i partiti chi sarà al primo posto, chi al secondo, ecc. Ci sono vantaggi e svantaggi in questo. Il principale svantaggio è che i candidati sono di fatto nominati, non hanno nessun motivo per rappresentare gli interessi del territorio che li ha eletti ma solo il capo del loro partito. Il principale vantaggi è che se le preferenze vengono assegnate ai singoli candidati dagli elettori, i candidati si scannano anche con i loro colleghi di partito, spendono un sacco di soldi per la campagna elettorale, e sostanzialmente finiscono per comprarsi i voti promettendo favori una volta eletti.

Ora arriviamo al Senato. È sostanzialmente la stessa cosa. Non ci sono le circoscrizioni elettorali, sostituite semplicemente dalle 20 regioni. Gli sbarramenti sono diversi (20%, 8%, 3% al posto di 10/4/2). Non c'è la regola che salva la migliore lista sotto lo sbarramento. Ma la differenza importante è che i senatori sono calcolati separatamente per ogni regione. Il risultato complessivo è la somma dei risultati di 20 ""proporzionalini""; il totale dei voti non conta, perché i voti della Lombardia non vengono mai sommati (per fare un esempio) con quelli del Lazio o del Friuli. Anche il calcolo di sbarramenti e premio di maggioranza viene effettuato separatamente in ogni regione.

Prendi la Lombardia. Prima fai i tuoi calcoli su 49 senatori. Poi controlli se la prima formazione (coalizione o lista non collegata) ne ha 27, se non li ha glieli assegni e ricalcoli i 22 seggi che spettano agli altri. Poi dividi i seggi tra le liste che appartengono alla stessa coalizione.

I risultati sono due:

* lo sbarramento in pratica è molto più alto dell'8%/3%. Diverse piccole regioni assegnano 7 senatori ciascuna, di cui 4 alla maggioranza e 3 alle minoranze. Una lista non collegata che prende il 20% difficilmente avrà anche un solo senatore. E anche in una coalizione, in queste regioni senza il 4-6% te ne stai a casa.

* mentre alla Camera chi vince ha una larga (_enorme_) maggioranza, al Senato non è detto. Questo perché il centrosinistra di solito vince in molte regioni, ma piccole. Il centrodestra in poche, ma grandi e con un cospicuo premio di maggioranza: vincere in Lombardia, Veneto, Sicilia, Lazio dà già 71 senatori (più del 20%). Aggiungi Piemonte e Campania e arrivi quasi a 100.

Nel complesso non è una porcata enorme come viene descritta. Il fatto di avere maggioranze diverse in Camera e Senato può capitare con qualunque sistema elettorale, e diventa un problema solo perché la nostra costituzione assegna gli stessi compiti alle due camere. Se così non fosse, sicuramente la ""coabitazione"" tra due maggioranze diverse sarebbe difficile, ma non impossibile.

La possibilità di candidarsi in più collegi è effettivamente assurda. Berlusconi o chi per esso viene messo in cima alla lista in tutta Italia, per attrarre voti, ma gli elettori alla fine si ritrovano in parlamento un ignoto secondo classificato. Peggio: il capolista, scegliendo da quale circoscrizione far venire il suo seggio, ""premia"" il primo dei non eletti in tutti gli altri seggi con un posto in Parlamento.  L'onorevole, diventato tale grazie alla ""benevolenza"" del capolista, ne diventa ancora più suddito. Ma anche questo non è un disastro.

L'altro grossissimo problema della legge Calderoli invece veramente condiziona il funzionamento delle istituzioni. È il premio di maggioranza alla Camera, che limita fortemente i margini di manovra del presidente della Repubblica. È a lui che spetta risolvere i casini del parlamento, ed è molto difficile che dopo le elezioni questi riesca a formare una ""grande coalizione"" se ad esempio le maggioranze sono diverse alla Camera e al Senato. Il governo deve ottenere la fiducia sia alla Camera sia al Senato, e il vincitore alla Camera di fatto può porre il veto su un candidato a lui non grato. Deve succedere veramente un cataclisma, come è stato nel PDL, per annullare questo vantaggio.

Bei hoher Lebenserwartung (und damit steigenden Krankenkosten etc.) und gleichzeitig immer weniger Berufstätigen insgesamt kann das System ja garnicht mehr funktionieren ohne massiv bezuschusst zu werden oder die Leistungen massiv einzuschränken. Hinzu kommt, dass immer mehr Leute in prekären Arbeitsverhältnissen (freelancer usw.) beschäftigt sind und garkeine Beiträge in die GKK zahlen.

Will sagen: der Weg der bisher in den USA gewählt wurde ist eigentlich eine annehmbare Option. Wer eine Krankenversicherung wichtig findet und dafür Geld ausgeben möchte hat eine, wer das Risiko keine zu haben tragen will, trägt es.

The police are the biggest gang, or, second to the state's military gang. They exert a territorial monopoly on force. They have no legal requirement to enforce any specific laws; it's up to the commander's wills and the individual mercenary's desire to keep his salary intact. In each region these gangs usually have the most organization, expertise, experience, weapons, ammo, armor, vehicles, communication systems, snatch squads, detention facilities, interrogation manuals, sense of righteousness, formal training in strategy and tactics, group solidarity, desire to cover up for their comrades, sense of legitimacy, propensity to stabilize power differentials, and established monopoly.

When a man spends more than half of the waking hours of his everyday life, five days a week, acting as an agent of repression toward deviancy and dissent, when he spends his time patrolling and profiling and interrogating, beating and snatching and caging, everyone outside of his organization's subculture starts to look like a hostile foreigner, every other domestic population an internal colony. Where once he might have had companionship, community and creativity, now he has only coercion, command and conformity. His world becomes one of paranoid policing and perceived persecution, rationalized repression and uniformed vengeance. And surely his heart becomes callous and dead. Now, a cop might have a charming personality outside of his role, but in his role he acts primarily as a force of repression.

The countries don't have the same profile, we don't export the same kind of things. Heck, we don't even consider ourselves a mostly-industrial country anymore. As far as exporting countries go, Germany is a powerhouse. It's #2 in the world, in front of the US, and manages to export in value 3/4 of what China does. France should more be compared to its other neighbors: Spain, Italy, UK. And then it gets a bit more favorable. 

My personal opinion is that there's also probably some cyclical or conjectural things going on. The heavy industry in France (Planes, power-plants, that kind of things) probably suffer more of the crisis than luxury German cars do. But that's of course not all that Germany produces.

Now, having said that, the competitiveness issue has long been identified, and it is one of the main challenges considered by this government. 

Alas, as Boromir's meme would say, one does not simply switch social policies financing into VAT overnight. The way we finance our social security, our families policies, even our retirement pensions is to do it with taxes that apply on salaries, instead of applying them as VAT or as income tax. As long as we export as much as we import, there's no big final difference between doing one or the other on a macro level, as French workers are French consumers and vice-versa. But of course, with a negative trade balance, the French worker ends up costing more than the foreign one, and the foreign products end up costing less. Alas, switching from one system of financing to the other though is tricky, because when removing the taxes on salaries, the employers might not give back the difference in wage to their employees. And on the other hand, the shops would still all get their prices going up. As the article says, performing this kind of change probably requires a growing economy, and now is apparently not the right moment.

Finally, we are a socialist country. Deal with it. We do have a high birth-rate because we do have lavish family policies. We do have the #1 healthcare system in the world because we do spend a lot of money on it (I mean, the first thing that came to my mind when I broke my leg was: thanks god I've broke it in France). And we only work 35hours a week, because work is strenuous, you know. Though apparently some say that we compensate that by a high productivity and not spending too much time on reddit during working hours. They're wrong apparently. Should we be the ones to spend less on our social policies, or should it be instead the rest-of-the-world that should start spending a bit more ? I let you decide. In any case, it's pointless to compare the amount of government spending with other countries: we are not another country, we are La République Française, une et indivisible.

It might seem unusual to you, because that's not how we do things. But others do.

The prestige dialect in the Arab World is Modern Standard Arabic, which is updated Quranic Arabic. The vernaculars spoken by the people (Egyptian Arabic, Morrocan Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, etc) are all quite different from the official dialect (MSA) pretty much enough so that they are two different languages.

By analogy, imagine that France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Romania, instead of having their respective standard languages, would all use a kind of updated Classical Latin. We find it unusual, because that's not how we roll.

([Something similar was tried in Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharevousa), but, unlike with Arabic, it was not succesful)

But we're diverging a bit from the original discussion.

You stress adaptability. Up until the 19th century afaik, the working language of the Hungarian kingdom (and succesive polities) was Medieval Latin. Hungarian was a vernacular dialect that had few words for complex philosophical  notions and new technological things. Then came nationalism, with its stress on the ""National Language"". Problem was, Hungarian was ill adapted as a language of the elites. So a group of writers [updated the language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language#Modern_Hungarian). The same was true with a lot of other languages. Languages have a way of adapting, but it depends many times on the preceived prestige of the language. Languages erode not because they cannot adapt (they are very adaptable), but because they are perceived as useless, or at least way less useful.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_death

&gt;The most common process leading to language death is one in which a community of speakers of one language becomes bilingual in another language, and gradually shifts allegiance to the second language until they cease to use their original (or heritage) language. This is a process of assimilation which may be voluntary or may be forced upon a population. Speakers of some languages, particularly regional or minority languages, may decide to abandon them based on economic or utilitarian grounds, in favour of languages regarded as having greater utility or prestige. This process is gradual and can occur from either bottom-to-top or top-to-bottom.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels#Languages

&gt;A still more important cause for the Frenchification [of Brussels] was the language change over several generations from Dutch to French that was performed in Brussels by the Flemish people themselves. The main reason for this was the political, administrative and social pressure, partly based on the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time; this made French the only language of administration, law, politics and education in Belgium and thus necessary for social mobility. From 1880 on, faced with the necessity of using French in dealing with such institutions, more and more Dutch-speakers became bilingual, and a rise in the number of monolingual French-speakers was seen after 1910. Halfway through the 20th century the number of monolingual French-speakers surpassed the number of mostly bilingual Flemish inhabitants.",0,1357901938,null,0,1357902128,0,c7v01w7,t3_16biug,t1_c7v01w7,t1_c7uzv4y,null,1430925723,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

It's not necessarily a 'natural' evolution of the language as in many cases the purpose behind extreme slang is to create a dialect that won't be understood by the 'normal' people - that's why you see these really extreme slang dialects develop in prisons or ghettos, but also in marketplaces - for example Cockney ryhyming slang originally developed so market traders could converse without patrons understanding what they were on about.

&gt; Should we be the ones to spend less on our social policies, or should it be instead the rest-of-the-world that should start spending a bit more ? I let you decide.

Well, you know there is a negative feedback cycle. As social democracy _over a certain level_ reduces productivity, which both reduces the tax income to spend and increases the need to spend it. The tricky part is, nobody knows where this level is. In fact, some amount of social democracy may even increase productivity: getting sick workers faster back to work, increasing demand and so on. But there is a level where it begins to reduce it, and reduce it two ways at the same time and nobody really knows where it is.

In fact, it says a lot about Reddit that I see almost everybody talking about such laws (workweek, holidays, maternity leaves) as if they were real.

Because you will never ever ever find any ambitious lawyer or mid-manager or project manager take full holidays, work as much as the official workweek, or even take their full maternity/paternity leave, no matter in how social a country you live in.

Aren't you getting a significant number of people out? There's plenty of people like Depardieu leaving France, I don't even now if your tax revenues will actually decrease as opposed to increasing, but whatever, you're free to ignore [basic economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve) and tax at whatever rate you want.

&gt;There is a difference between firing someone and having a flexible (but secured) workforce.

And there's also populist politicians that want to pander to the workers by making the whole economy more uncompetitive, I'm sure it's fine, you'll continue to be able to tax more and more to make up for the difference and if factories start closing shop and moving elsewhere, you can continue to spend taxpayers money to keep them afloat, no?

&gt;Well, yeah. The fact that you cut spendings does not mean that you have to cut them everywhere. There is such a thing as a necessary investment.

Sure, there is. Though I wonder if you can afford these ""necessary"" investments when your economy is failing and you're just piling on the debt and leaving it for future generations.

I don't understand your question.

No, the state interfering with the labour market isn't good for the workers on the long run, it might reassure those who do have a job that they're safe but it makes unemployed people that much harder to employ and can be a burden on the whole economy, making it more uncompetitive which can have really averse effects on the long run.

Per cominciare, bisogna notare che il nome del presidente del Consiglio è puramente indicativo; alla fine è il presidente della Repubblica a sceglierlo dopo aver consultato i partiti.

Seppur cosa tecnicamente possibile, nella prassi il presidente della Repubblica non può nominare a suo piacimento l'individuo incaricato di formare il nuovo governo, deve assolutamente tener conto delle consultazioni presidenziali che si svolgono con i gruppi parlamentari, i presidenti delle 2 camere e gli ex presidenti della Repubblica.
Nel caso queste consultazioni non diano i propri frutti è sì possibile che il presidente decida di sua spontanea volontà, ma sempre tenendo conto delle preferenze espresse dalle varie forze politiche, e sarebbe comunque più probabile a quel punto uno sciglimento delle camere.
Se anche il presidente della Repubblica nominasse un individuo a suo piacimento, troverebbe comunque lo sbarramento del Parlamento al momento della mozione di fiducia, fiducia senza la quale il governo non può chiaramente entrare in funzione.

true,Lams,FRAN,France,"&gt;Sub-replacement birth rates are not really high (currently 2, 2.1 would be replacement). Also I think it would be high time to measure the quality of births. Is it the middle-class family having 2 kids, or they have 0 and it is the toilet cleaner family having 4?

It's a good remark. And actually, this is one place where France gets it right. Instead of paying people to stay at home with their kids, we encourage them in all kind of manner to get back to work. One of them is by having a very comprehensive set of daycare solutions for the kids. Almost all 3 year-olds go to school (ok, just 93% of them actually). And in most cities, they can be dropped as early as 7am and picked back at 7pm. This is the key to encourage not just the lower-income people to have kidsm, but the middle-class too. I couldn't find stats for the whole of France, but partial ones for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais (please don't laugh fellow frenchmen) don't show a massive difference in the family sizes between low-income (26% have 3 kids or more) and high-income families (18% of them).



&gt; Don't be ridiculous, I get emails from our Paris subsidiary written 22:00 Saturday. Workweek laws may have an effect on blue-collar people, but I've yet to see any ambitious white-collar person with an aim to get into management give any fuck about workweek laws in any country. If there is a clock, they clock out, and go right back.

Well, first, let's ignore the Millenials generation and their different outlook on that. You're right, the white collar people have mostly a different scheme: they work long hours, don't clock actually, but get back days off in-lieu. We call them the ""RTT"". In most companies, that's about 10-15 days a year. You thus end up with 35-40 days of holidays in total. And almost everyone takes them all. Just like by law, you're not supposed to have less than a 45 minutes lunch break, and it's very rare to see people not taking an hour for lunch. Again, your Paris Office manager is an exception here. 
 
I think you get France wrong. Lawyers, Surgeons, Nurses, Senior Managers, they work long hours. The rest of the country, a bit less so. Like most managers, your workaholic Paris office manager is not representative of the millions of teachers, cashiers, builders, paper pushers, etc. And as I said, the newer generation - in France just like elsewhere - is a bit less prone in spending its life at the office than the previous one.

La justification sur les 1000 heures n'est pas bonne, je prends la phrase la plus neutre dans le [rapport source](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1950_1959/fulltext/003c09.pdf) :

&gt;One of the first actions of the Phoebus organisation when it was
created in 1925 was to lay down a standard life of 1,000 hours—then
already in common use in the United Kingdom and elsewhere—for general
service filament lamps; it was provided that no mention of "" long life""
should be made in any advertisement for lamps. A scheme for penalising
excessive life or short life was worked out and after 1929 there were fines
for a life in excess of 1,500 hours and fines on a lower scale for a life
shorter than 800 hours unless the manufacturer had given notice that he had
economic justification for making the life shorter. The Phoebus organisation
did not at that time prescribe any minimum (or maximum) luminous
efficiency, but if all manufacturers employed the best techniques of design
and manufacture known at the time this system would indirectly ensure
lamps of reasonable luminous efficiency, and we have obtained no evidence
that it injured consumers. No doubt the prescription of a maximum life
without a minimum luminous efficiency had potential dangers.

Si tu lis le rapport, tu vois évidemment qu'il y a une entente à tous les niveaux pour maintenir les prix les plus hauts possibles, tout en éliminant les concurrents qui feraient de meilleurs produits moins chers.

La doctrine ""le sens de l'évolution"", ""les meilleurs produits gagnent"" n'est donc pas vérifiée.

Ensuite, pour être précis :

&gt;la durée de vie de 1000 heures est un compromis technique entre diverses qualités, et pas une tentative pour escroquer les consommateurs.

Le rapport montre qu'il n'y a pas de preuves que l'industrie a porté volontairement préjudice au consommateur (à part bien sûr en maintenant des prix élevés et en éliminant la concurrence). Il montre aussi que le fait de diminuer la durée de vie maximum élimine des ampoules à faible luminosité, mais à longue durée de vie. Si on défend la liberté de choix des consommateurs, on n'a pas à lui interdire cela.

Imagine that 5 french franc(ff) is the equivalent of 1 german mark(gm).

Now imagine that by 'printing more money' all of a sudden ff become worth less e.g. 5 ff are worth only 0.5 gm or 1 gm is worth 10ff.

By doing this, to produce the product in france still costs 10ff but in gm that product is only worth 1gm (due to the fact that 1ff now suddenly is worth 1gm).  this effectivly means that labor costs on the product are half that in France than in Germany, making it for a company more sane to produce in France then in Germany.

Of course this can only gives a temporary advantage since your employees only get half of the value they used to get. The income in ff stays the same, but when looking at it in gm the only earn half what they used to make. During that time, french citizend will have to buy cheaper French products instead of more expensive (due to labor costs) German products.

if the yearly worth (gdp) of a country of france is 100 gm of 500ff (and there are to make this simple only 500ff in circulation). Now if france prints an extra 500ff. There are now 1000ff for a country that has a worth in GM of only 100gm.

probably too simple of an explanation to really matter but it gives you an idee :)

And by that I mean that you *have to pay* for it, it's not optional - I'm pretty sure that's true for Erasmus students as well. (Edit: the 240€ is the sum of all the University fees you have to pay. The ticket is the most expensive part of it at ~150€.)

The main advantage is that this student card is a ticket for all busses in Bonn and for all ""regional"" trains in NRW. [Travel all the way to Mönchengladbach, Paderborn and Osnabrück for free.](http://www.studenten-nrw-ticket.de/images/nrw-bereich.jpg)

You will have to suffer some jokes about Poles being all thieves.

Why would I, personally, care about that? I live in Barcelona and don't a fuck in what country it is located in or what it's called. If independent Catalonia sucks I'll simply move to Madrid. 

Also, unlike countries such as the UK and France, Spain has since given up most links to the old empire; we're the nation equivalent of retired parents that have sent their children off to university to fend for themselves while we dedicate our time to raising goats.

There's that short while when you're a kid and everything's great and after that you've just spent too many years in the dark winters or whatever and you start complaining about everything, it's like second nature.

I once remarked to a friend of mine that if you had a scale of 
'what is school (replace with any other noun) like' with the options;

a) Okay, I guess

b) Kind of shit

c) Shit

d) Fucking shit

you might get a better gage of what kids think. I mean even if you say 'yea this is kind of shitty' it doesn't mean you dislike the place. You just don't say things like 'yea it's great' in Finnish, there's always *something* you can complain about. And what we end up with, is that school might be really nice and all, but no one picks the highest options on questionnaires just because of the mentality. And I don't think our schools are in any way specifically behind kids turning out this way, it's a societal and cultural thing; and we might just be measuring it's effects instead of actual failings of the school system.
