Natürlich war die Art und Weise wie sich Brüderle rausgewunden hat ebenfalls unprofessionel aber so schliesst sich der Kreis. Jedoch:
&gt;
&gt;Hätte Brüderle die einzig angemessene Antwort gegeben, dass er nämlich keine Lust habe, zu dieser unernsten Zeit eine ernste Frage zu beantworten, hätte er ja den Befund der Journalistin, der sich nur als Frage tarnt, bestätigt: armer, alter Mann, zu schwach, mit einer jungen Frau auch nach Mitternacht noch zu diskutieren.

Statt dessen hat die Frau nun dafür gesorgt, dass sich Politiker noch mehr absetzen werden und wer kann es ihnen verdenken? Es ist sogar schlimmer: 

Die Zeitung wollte angeblich mit diesem Showartikel eine Diskussion anstossen. Moral und Anstand und so.

Jedoch so dumm kann kein Journalist sein, dass er glauben würde, der Beitrag würde irgendwie gut ankommen bei den betroffenen Männern. Sie lachen darüber. Ich bin schon gespannt was die Heute Show draus macht. Die weiblichen Journalistinen werden mit dem Kopf schütteln und die männlichen sich freuen, dass sie mal wieder beliebter geworden sind.

Danke. Good Job.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The UK contributed €7 billion to the €85 billion bailout of Ireland in 2010, which is being paid back to the UK gov. with interest. To put this in perspective, €17.5 billion was taken from the Irish Pension Reserve Fund out of a total of €35 billion which was used to prop up the Irish banking system in this ""bailout"". 

Specifically who benefits from this €35 billion bailout of Irish banks? Since the Irish state refuses to burn bondholders, (some of whom are UK financial corporations and some who are UK based financial corporations) the contributing nations to the bailout make about 3% interest on the bailout loan, as well as the tax take from the private financial institutions who aren't writing off losses in these other states because the Irish state hasn't burned bondholders. 

The last time the bondholder payment list was leaked the majority of the bondholders were German but there were a few UK based companies on that list too, more so a lot of the bondholders traded out of the UK.

Long story short, the war chest for bailouts, (fuck knows what they are calling it now) came to €750 billion. (€440 from the EZ, €250 from the IMF and the other €90 from the rest of the EU not in the EZ, including the UK) So the war chest stumped up €22.5 billion, (primarily bankrolled by Germany but it's a pot so we'll give the UK credit here) IMF put in the same amount to the bailout too, out of a total of €65 billion. Ireland put in €17.5 of it's own money and Sweden and Denmark made up the chump change, which was nice of them.

It was in the UK/Germany's interest to bankroll us as our bondholders were mostly German but the financial hit the UK would take from us going under would have been catastrophic. Being one our biggest trading partners, or the contagion to the City of London (as a world financial hub and tax cash cow for the UK), or even just the amounts which normally go to the UK tax coffers that would be written off at the end of the year by these UK based holders of Irish bonds would be multiples of the €7 billion loaned to Ireland. Fun Fact: British banks' lending to Ireland during the crisis was €149bn, the highest in the EU. Think they'd risk that over lending us an extra €7 billion?

Long story short, it bought German and UK based financial institutions time to boost reserves to safeguard against exposure to Irish based institutions. Anyone who tells you it was out of neighbourly solidarity is trying to sell you something. (We'll see the UK give again when bailout two happens for the same reason, although it won't be phrased that way) They weren't legally obliged but when they did they maths they had no other choice out of self-interest. Worst case scenario the UK looses less than they would have, best case they get it all back with interest. 

No one who bailed Ireland out deserves a pat on the back for being genuinely good, such is life, but if you're looking to give credit just by amounts given to the bailout, Germany is #1, UK is a distant #2, although they have the most to loss should we go tits up as the most exposed, so make of that what you will.",0,1359445258,null,0,1359446411,0,c85irml,t3_17da2k,t1_c85irml,t1_c84i7r8,null,1431116240,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I disagree with this and I think the prominence spelling bees in English-speaking countries attests to the fact that spelling is difficult. I could imagine a Spanish spelling bee making test cricket look exciting. I've found a [paper](http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/35562310.pdf) which explains.

&gt; A comparative study by Seymour et al., undertaken in 2003 (see figures 1 &amp; 2), shows that after one year of instruction, **English children show the lowest percentage of correct word reading on a scale in comparison to other European countries**, with only 30-40% correct words compared to German, Greek and Finnish, with close to 100%.

The authors go on to explain further:

&gt; Written Finnish stands in stark contrast to written English, which in every classification appears as the most inconsistent “deep” orthography in the world. In English the reader has first to be able to make orthographic segmentation of multi-letter and often inconsistent graphemes (thief - /th/ /ie/ /f/), where the knowledge of basic letter sounds does not suffice for being able to use the grapheme/phoneme (letter/sound) correspondences. 
In English, the reader also has to take contextual influences into consideration, and some irregular words completely elude phonemic assembly, e.g. “yacht”. 
In successful reading, the brain must first make a correct connection between the orthographic character of the word (i.e. visual appearance) and its sound. In some orthographies, a phoneme can have multiple spellings (English, French, Hebrew), whereas in others it is always spelled the same way. For example, the words cow and bough rhyme in English, as do true and through, though you would not expect it by appearances. On the other hand, some spellings can be pronounced differently, such as “ough” in English, which is sounded differently in bough; through; though and enough.

Allora reddit era appena nato e noi di Digg lo prendavamo in giro soprattutto per la GUI che ti ""spaccava gli occhi"" (ancora non si potevano mettere i commenti, c'era solo la frontpage). Ma dopo qualche mese reddit aveva fatto passi da gigante con le subreddit e i commenti.

Quando successe il casino con MrBabyMan ci rendemmo conto di cosa era diventato Digg e molti come me cominciarono ad usare reddit. Su Digg ci sono gli ""shout"" (credo ci siano ancora), quando un utente posta qualcosa, tutti i suoi ""amici o follower"" ricevono una notifica. Quindi era facile creare una massa di tirapiedi che portavano le tue sottomissioni in front page. Si creo' un vero e proprio commercio, Digg allora era l'unica Front Page di internet.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I'm not sure what you're referring to here?

Sorry, it is in the stability pact, but it is referred to in the Lisbon treaty, if I am not incorrect. 

Anyway,  lot of things, but let us take article 125 for example, the ""no bailout clause"", that explicity *forbids* that any other country should  pay for another countries debt, or article 123, that forbids ECB to directly buy securities (värdepapper) from countries .

However, as we all know, that is not happening. In fact, every single minute that is being ignored and broken. 

I can understand *why* one ignored it, at the beginning. *But*, what I can not understand, or even stand, is that you *do not re-negotiate and let people vote about it*. Instead, what they are doing is slowly pushing people towards a federal union, and a transfer union at that (which is explicitly forbidden btw). 

If that is what people want - I am OK with that. But *we need to vote about it*. 

Besides, one can't just go around breaking laws all the time. Then you re-write them. Imagine how that would look at a national level, in Danmark for example. Helle Thorning Schmidt just decided to ignore international treaties and the constituion for a while, and then refuse to let people vote about it. Everyone would be outraged. 

&gt;Obviously, a fair and non-negotiable basic system for EU contributions must be set in place,

Well, that is not happening any time soon, due to several reasons. The French for one, are refusing to abandon their CAP, who is 44% of the budget. The CAP is anything *but* fair and balanced. 


Second, the Eurozone countries have demonstrated, with chilling contempt  how little they care about law, rules and regulations. The stability pact, anyone? The rules of the ECB anyone? They are breaking them right now. As we speak. 


So, we *should* have fair rules that everyone should follow, sure. We should also live in peace, no discriminate, save the planet etc, but none of it is very likely to happen.

I'm talking about contributions, not subsidies — i.e. how each country's membership fee is calculated should be according to a fair system that treats everyone equally, not based on whatever current PM's diplomatic prowess (Thatcher) or that country's specific economic structure.

The CAP is controversial for a reason — it's a really complicated system designed to regulate an extremely complicated market. I'm not against getting rid of it, but most of the time people don't actually realise what that means — are Europeans ready to occasionally pay significantly more for basic foodstuffs? Are we ready to see small niche products leave the market, when the reality of necessary scale to be sustainable, not to mention profitable, hits farmers across Europe? I don't think so. Every industrialised nation or supranational entity on the planet subsidises its agricultural sector (US, Japan, EU), and that subsidy is part of what creates the relative economic stability in those places. When people talk about getting rid of the CAP, they really need to start proposing alternatives that solve the same problem.

I think we can both agree to this. I think most people in this forum, in Europe, or in the world, agree that it is a problem :-).

However - what is being done? Nothing. 

The EU has absolutely no credibility whatsoever until they start dealing with that. 


&gt;I'm talking about contributions, not subsidies — i.e. how each country's membership fee is calculated should be according to a fair system that treats everyone equally, not based on whatever current PM's diplomatic prowess (Thatcher) or that country's specific economic structure.

Yes, you have a very good point there, however, they aren't even following the current rules and regulations, so I don't think they are about to calculate a new system. 

&gt;The CAP is controversial for a reason — it's a really complicated system designed to regulate an extremely complicated market. I'm not against getting rid of it, but most of the time people don't actually realise what that means — are Europeans ready to occasionally pay significantly more for basic foodstuffs?

I have read a lot about the CAP and I do not agree with you there. It is mainly beneficial to France, Spain, Italy etc, not to the rest of Europe. 

While I agree that we need a system for subsidising the agricultural industy, I think it can be done a lot better for example if Sweden did it on their own. As it is now, half of the money we pay to the EU goes to subsidise farmers in other countries, while, explicity, treating our own unfairly. I don't mind paying extra for other countries, but then it needs to be a fair system. It isn't, it is a horrible system that isn't even sustainable. 

It is the same for a lot of other countries, as well, Denmark too, I am sure. 

And again - where are the reforms?  They promise reforms, but it never happens (or at least not to a significant degree). So, something needs to happen. My suggestion is that we remove the CAP completely, and pay on our own - or, we reform it completely. Neither is very likely to happen, the EU is just going to continue to discriminate Sweden (together with most of Eastern Europe for example) and take our money. 

Why should we continue with a crap system when we can reform? Well, because the French want to. Apparently that is enough. To me it isn't, and it is just another prime example of EU's failures.

The democratic deficit is growing every day, and nobody is doing anything.

The debate currently going on is about what should be included when calculating the central government deficit. I don't have all the data and I can't be 100% sure about what really went on, we'll know more when the investigation is over. The accusers claim that EUROSTAT's manual allowed for some public interest (but not wholly public-owned) corporations to remain outside of the calculations, which is the norm in other EU countries too. It seems that there are different approaches to methodology and interpretation. The head of ELSTAT might claim that EUROSTAT's manual allows for what he did, and he might be right, but the other approach might be correct too. Despite that, there are loads of other issues (hacking claims, legality of decisions during meetings where members were absent, forgery, inclusion of defense expenditure when ordering or when equipment is delivered, and others).

Instead of speculating and building in the private sector, banks are paying off debts, reducing exposure and de-leveraging.

* la religion est un truc que l'on t'inculque quand tu es petit. Famille catho ? Tu es catho. Famille musulmane ? Tu es musulman, etc. Ce n'est pas un choix volontaire, ni une obligation naturelle. Si on ne te parle jamais de Dieu, tu n'y penseras jamais tout seul...
* il y a une ""doctrine officielle"". Ce qui veut donc dire détermination d'une vérité officielle, rejet des autres choix, promulgation de règles à respecter... C'est marrant cette manie de Dieu de ne pas être très causant, alors que son clergé lui fait dire beaucoup de choses.
* on peut étudier les religions comme n'importe quel autre champ historique : elles apparaissent, évoluent, disparaissent... Les anciens égyptiens *aussi* avaient un mythe de la création du monde, une vie après la mort et une punition pour les pêcheurs... Et ils étaient persuadés que tout cela était vrai... Ce qui ne nous empêche pas de considérer ceci comme de la *mythologie*. Les croyants d'aujourd'hui ne voient pas leurs religions comme la mythologie de demain. Elles (je parle de toutes les religions) ne sont pourtant pas moins ""merveilleuses"", c'st à dire relevant du domaine du merveilleux. 
* les postulats des religions sont tous mis en défaut par les progrès de la science. On sait que nous ne descendons pas tous d'Adam et Eve, on sait expliquer certains évènements présentés comme des miracles, on sait que la terre tourne autour du soleil et non l'inverse, on sait que la matière est constituée d'atomes, n'en déplaise à l'Eglise, etc. Du coup, les croyants ""modernes"" se dépêtrent comme ils peuvent entre les articles de foi, leurs convictions personnelles et le rationalisme moderne. Un peu comme toi m'expliquant que le pape n'est pas créationniste. Lorsque Darwin a énoncé sa théorie, c'était lui qui était vu comme farfelu... J'aime beaucoup [ce billet de Tristan Nitot](http://standblog.org/blog/post/2013/01/13/Mon-coming-out), qui traduit son désarroi de catho : *Avoir des aspirations spirituelles est passablement mal vu en ce début de 21° siècle. En effet, on a tendance à mélanger religion, Église, dogmes et foi et par là même, à jeter le bébé avec l'eau du bain. Alors on apprend à courber l'échine face à l'animosité ambiante contre tout ce qui est religion et spirituel.* C'est pourtant bien là que le bas blesse : si l'on est vraiment dans sa religion, *on ne peut pas* séparer ""religion, Église, dogmes et foi"", il faut tout prendre. Mais les cathos modernes, mal dans leurs baskets, font leur petite liste de courses et prennent ce qui les arrange... au lieu de tout rejeter en reconnaissant s'être fourvoyés.
* Pourquoi est-ce que les hommes croient ? Parce qu'ils savent qu'ils vont mourir. C'est le principal enjeu d'une religion : expliquer à l'homme angoissé que sa vie n'est pas dénuée de sens, et qu'il y a quelque chose après. Peut-être plus généralement existe t-il un besoin de spiritualité inhérent à l'homme, qui entre en concurrence avec son besoin d'expliquer le monde.

Mon but n'est pas de provoquer, je respecte les croyances des autres, mais la notion de ""croyance"" au sens religieux du terme est quelque chose qui choque mon entendement. J'ai bien conscience de faire partie de l'infime minorité des terriens qui ne croient en rien, et je me demande parfois si je ne suis pas atteint d'une tare mentale quelconque m'empêchant d'accéder à ce statut... et je finis par me dire que non : j'ai cru, relativement longtemps, et j'ai fini par me poser des questions, pour en tirer mes propres conclusions.

Dann erzähl mir doch mal, wie man Israels Außenpolitik und Militäreinsätze gegen Zivilisten betrachten kann, ohne einen Hass auf die Verantwortlichen zu bekommen? Anfangs neutrale Betrachtung führt in diesem Fall zwingend zu einer massiven Abneigung. Zu einem neutralen Endergebnis kann man nur kommen, wenn man bei einer massiv positiven Position beginnt oder wenn man sich ständig selber an die ""Schuld der Deutschen"" erinnert.

Aber nicht mit mir. Ja, was Juden während des Holocausts passiert ist war schrecklich und ja das deutsche Volk hat zu dieser Zeit große Schuld auf sich geladen aber nein, ich war nicht beteiligt und für mich ist die Situation ganz simpel: Bei jedem anderen Land würde man Diskriminierung, Kriegsverbrechen und Terrorherrschaft reden und wahrscheinlich würde man sogar internationale Sanktionen verhängen und der einzige Grund warum dies nicht passiert, ist das jeder der Israel kritisiert sich sofort mit dem Vorwurf des Antisemitismus konfrontiert sieht, wie bspw Günther Grass.

Und diese Rhetorik ist ein weiterer Grund, warum das Verhalten Israels zu verachten ist. Jede Kritik wird abgelenk und stattdessen wird der Kritisierend als Nazi-Sympathisant bezeichnet. Als würde man jemanden darauf hinweisen, dass sein Kind dabei ist Sand zu essen und als Antwort zu hören bekommt ""HÖR AUF MEIN KIND ANZUSTARREN DU WIDERLICHER PÄDOPHILER"".

Und um direkt an die nächste Frage anzuknüpfen: Diese Rhetorik ist zumindest bei Deutschen Juden (vertreten durch den Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland) auch sehr üblich. Verbot von Beschneidung zum Schutze des Kindeswohls? Anti-Semitismus! Jemand sagt ""Kamingespräch""? [Anti-Semitismus](http://www.derwesten.de/sport/fussball/em/zentralrat-der-juden-uebt-scharfe-kritik-an-bierhoff-und-dem-dfb-id6727315.html)!

Also ja, jeder der die Außenpolitik Israels unterstützt oder sich dieser Art von Rhetorik bedient, verdient es, nicht gemocht zu werden.

Israel und seine Unterstützer sind wie das Kind was gemobbt wurde und aufwächst und andere mobbt.

The US army is a brutally effective machine. There's no denying that. However just because a conflict isn't done in a way that mirrors the American led conflicts, doesn't mean it is being done wrong.

That i'm not agreeing with, but that's not the point.

My point is, after driving for almost 10 years in and outside Paris (and i'm not talking about getting the car out once a year to go on holidays, i mean driving at least once a week, and everywhere inside Paris) that there are rules to the chaos of the city's driving. There are patterns associated with the type of vehicles you drive along in the streets, and what is and is not acceptable to do on the road. Which is the opposite of what the article said.

It didn't say it wasn't pleasant to drive in Paris, it said :

&gt; Only in one field of local endeavor **do no rules apply**: driving.

I was merely pointing a fact.

&gt; Many people in the comments are denying that service workers in Paris are rude

I'm not saying there are no rude people in the service industry. I was pointing the fact that people, as a general rule, are really dismissive and rude to the service people. If in a small city it can be okay, in a metropolis like Paris, where people are rude to you in a whole lot of different languages, you get tired of the stupid questions people ask because they wouldn't make the tiniest effort. And of the people believing that because you are in the service industry you should speak their language, whereas they did not bother learning yours, or even English.

Also i have to say, in 10 years, i haven't had that much people, in the service industry or in the streets, be that rude to me.

But it's a known fact that people will take one bad experience (for example, rain on a few Sundays every year) and extrapolate it into a general rule (it always rains on Sundays, while it never rains during the work week). Add to that the self-realizing prophecy effect (*i.e.* i'm believing that service people will be rude to me, therefore everything they do i'll see in a bad light) and you got that image that can't be shaken.",0,1359471430,null,0,false,0,c85mjwc,t3_17gumt,t1_c85mjwc,t1_c85lmxm,null,1431118141,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

On the other hand up here we often gently shake our heads when we hear about some stuff in southern cultures, like for instance that apparently many children (and especially men) don’t move out of their parents home until they’re way into adulthood (40 even) as signs of something gone very wrong. It’s the same with US “helicopter parents,” which are also generally looked upon as borderline insane, since they rob the children of the opportunity to learn how to fend for themselves. Fifteen years ago a Danish mother on vacation in New York was arrested for child neglect for letting her kid sleep alone in the baby carriage while she was inside a café or a shop. Which is common practice in Denmark, also through -10 degree winter snow. This incident is still often brought up in Denmark of how crazy Americans are.

An anecdote. One of my brothers went on a year study abroad to the USA when he was 15. I distinctly remember my mother saying that the fact that he didn’t look back when he walked down the corridor to the plane as proof that she had done some things right. I’d agree with that.

Il senso del derivato sta nel fatto che io e te abbiamo aspettative diverse sul valore del quadro: io penso che non valga nulla, e mi intasco 50 euro senza fatica; tu invece pensi che possa valere più di 1.000 euro.

Per fare un esempio reale, oggi comprare opzioni call su Apple, scadenza 16 febbraio, prezzo di esercizio 410 dollari, costa $46,20. Oggi un'azione Apple vale 455 dollari. Se tu pensi che il prezzo di Apple da qui al 16 febbraio sarà più alto di 410 (anzi, di 410 + 46,20, il prezzo dell'opzione), allora riterrai conveniente comprare quest'opzione. Infatti, se alla scadenza il prezzo di Apple è salito a 500 dollari, tu le compri a 410, le rivendi a 500 e ci guadagni 90 dollari meno il costo dell'opzione (46,20). Se il prezzo delle azioni Apple invece scende, tu non eserciti l'opzione (chi te lo fa fare di comprare a 410 qualcosa che puoi comprare direttamente sul mercato a un prezzo più basso) e ci rimetti 46,20 euro. Chi ti vende l'opzione fa il ragionamento opposto e spera che il prezzo scenda, così si tiene i 46,20 euro. Con un'opzione call hai perdite limitate (46,20 euro al massimo) e guadagni potenzialmente illimitati. Chi te la vende ha un profitto limitato (46,20) e perdite potenzialmente illimitate.
Nota che oggi puoi comprare anche un'opzione che ti consente di comprare un'azione Apple a 500 dollari il 16 febbraio: costa solo 95 centesimi. Il differenziale di prezzo rispetto all'altra opzione è spiegato dal fatto che è molto meno probabile che il prezzo di Apple salga sopra i 500 dollari entro il 16 febbraio. Ma se ne vuoi una che scade il 20 aprile, sempre con un prezzo di esercizio di $500, il valore sale a $7,50, perché in questo caso c'è molto più tempo a disposizione affinché il prezzo di Apple superi i $500.",0,1359473178,null,0,false,0,c85n06s,t3_17g88m,t1_c85n06s,t1_c85mce7,null,1431118364,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

true,Pfeffersack,GERM,Norddeutschland,"Natürlich besteht zweifelsfrei die Möglichkeit, nach Lehre der Katholischen Kirche bei Suizid in die Hölle zu kommen. Es ist jedoch nicht (!) sicher, und Sätze wie „dafür kommt ein Katholik in die Hölle“, sind umso beleidigender, wenn sie nicht mal die Wahrheit widerspiegeln.

Eine Todsünde führt tatsächlich dazu, die Chancen für einen ""Höllenritt"" immens zu steigern. Nun ist es aber so, dass die Todsünde Voraussetzungen hat, ohne die sie keine Todsünde ist. Beispiel: Person A ermordet seinen Nachbar. Die wahnhaft Kranke Person B ermordet seinen Nachbar. Während Person A in aller Regel (ohne die Einzelheiten zu kennen) eine Todsünde begangen hat, hat Person B in aller Regel (ohne die Einzelheiten zu kennen) keine Todsünde begangen.

* Der Sünder muss sich der Falschheit seines Handels vollkommen bewusst sein. Schuldhafte Blindheit für die Tatsachen (ignorantia facti) befreit davon jedoch nicht.

* Die Sünde muss mit voller Absicht geschehen und bewusst, wobei der Sünder sich dabei im Klaren sein muss, dass er der Versuchung auch widerstehen könnte.

* Die Sünde muss schwer sein: Es handelt sich um ein schwere Übertretung der göttlichen Ordnung.

Interessant ist auch Nr. 2282 des Katechismus der Katholischen Kirche:

&gt;2282 Wenn der Selbstmord in der Absicht begangen wird, als Beispiel -vor allem für junge Menschen - zu dienen, bildet er zudem ein schweres Ärgernis. Freiwillige Beihilfe zum Selbstmord verstößt gegen das sittliche Gesetz.

&gt;*Schwere psychische Störungen, Angst oder schwere Furcht vor einem Schicksalsschlag, vor Qual oder Folterung können die Verantwortlichkeit des Selbstmörders vermindern.*

http://www.vatican.va/archive/DEU0035/_P86.HTM (Kursivformatierung von mir hinzugefügt)

Momentan wird regelmäßig argumentiert, dass Selbstmord eine schwere psychische Störungen voraussetzt und deswegen es nicht zu erwarten sei, dass er eine Todsünde darstellt.

Vergleicht man nun die bekannt gewordenen Angriffsdetails mit einer Spähattacke, die am 25. August 2007 auf Server der Bundesregierung stattgefunden hat, ergeben sich verblüffende Parallelen. Die Kaspersky-Experten haben diesen Vorfall nicht untersucht. „Wir haben mit unseren Analysen erst im Oktober 2012 begonnen“, berichtet Magnus Kalkuhl vom Kaspersky-Labor und führt aus: „Was 2007 wo passiert ist, lässt sich leider nicht mehr nachvollziehen.“ Immerhin aber deuten die gefundenen Zeitstempel darauf hin, dass die Spionagenetze von „Roter Oktober“ bereits im Jahr 2007 aktiv waren.

Die deutschen Sicherheitsbehörden geben sich hier weitgehend ahnungslos, und auch der Bundesnachrichtendienst will die Spähattacke von 2007 nicht noch einmal im Licht der jetzt bekannt gewordenen Spionagedetails bewerten. Damals hatten Vertreter der Sicherheitsbehörden Hacker der chinesischen Volksbefreiungsarmee für die Spähattacke verantwortlich gemacht und für sich reklamiert, den Diebstahl von weiteren 160 Gigabyte vertraulichen Regierungsdaten verhindert zu haben.

Die Art des Transfers von großen Datenmengen, die Verwendung der Sicherheitslücken in den Programmen Excel und Word, die Methode, Kommunikation zwischen dem damaligen Kommandoserver und den im Regierungseigentum befindlichen Zielrechnern zu verschlüsseln, das alles weist in einigen Details eine verblüffende Übereinstimmung auf.

* Young man (23ish) broke both his legs, had to go stay longer in the hospital because he lived alone and none could help him at home -stuff like buying groceries, showering, getting up and down the stairs (his parents lived in the same city, visited him around twice during his stay).

* A father with young kids had appendicitis, and had to have an emergency surgery. His wife stayed with him at the hospital. His mother charged him double for taking care of her grandchildren on an extra, unplanned day (I'm not against them paying the grandmother for babysitting if she does it in a regular basis, but come on!).

* Guy was operated. Parents live in the same city. All he got was a ""gute Besserung"" by text message (even he was shocked, that's why he told me).

Then there's this culture of the ""stay at home mom"" when the children are small, which surprised me because it's not common in Spain at all. They sacrifice career opportunities because they enjoy being with their children, and want to give them the best possible care, and yet something ""breaks"" when the kids get bigger and they don't manage to bond with them.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; If the rest of the nations would abrogate their defense budgets to the EU, the CAP budget would probably be less than 1%

First, what does the defence has to do with the CAP? A common defence would indicate one state, and we are not there yet.



Second, if the CAP was fair and balanced, I wouldn't mind, but it isn't. France get more than their fair, share, it is biased against Eastern Europe, Sweden and Finland, and Spain, Portugal France get more than they should. It is not focusing on environmental sustainable procedures. What more, it is absolutely no connection about the wealth of the country and how much it receives, (example, French farmers receives more than Lithuanian).

The CAP is *less* stupid and damaging than it used to be, but it doesn't mean that it is not damaging or stupid. 

For example, can you explain why Sweden, in a lot of cases get less money per exactly the same cow, fed and brought up in the exact same way than the French counterpart? We have been arguing about that since we joined in 1995, don't tell me the French haven't noticed, they just do not care. 

&gt;Secondly, what democratic deficit?

I see it as a democratic deficit, that every day they are disobeying the rules, laws and regulations of the Lisbon treaty, the statue of the ECB, the stability pact and basically anything else you can think of.

Don't you think it is? 

If the chef of the Swedish Central Bank blatantly disobeyed the rules, he would be fired- immediately. If Reinfeldt ignored the constitution, he would be too actually. Why doesn't that happen in Europe? Should people be able to ignore laws and get away with it - is that your opinion? 

Can you tell me why nothing has happend to those who ignore rule 123 and 125 of the ECB for example. Those rules who clearly state that each and every country is responsible for their own debt, and no other countries tax payers should share the burden. What is more, the ECB is forbidden to buy individual securities from individual countries (like the bonds they are buying each and every day from southern Europe). 

When they are disobeying, they should be punished, or let go, shouldn't they? Instead, nothing happens to people who break the law. That is certainly a democratic deficiency, the EU do not care about following the rules and regulations they set up. Or are you saying it is OK not to obey? 

Oh, and why haven't any of the countries that should have been punished for not following the stability pact been punished? 

A country/union/whatever, who doesn't manage to make people or regions follow the rules are in deep shit, and that is extremely troubling. Can't you see that? 


Also, since the Eurozone, slowly (and completely against the rules) is pushing the EU towards a federal union, shouldn't we be allowed to vote about it? Or, do you think EU should go completely federal without people voting?

It has a formula that's used to determine how much each agricultural entity deserves based on things such as size of land, average yearly income in the country it's being applied to, and so forth.

Of course it isn't. I was talking about ""skogsbete"". That is how the cows go outside to eat, in the summer/spring (when the weather allows it), in Sweden. 

You get grants based on the size of the land, and the ""condition"", for lack of a better English word. The condition, is among other things, based on the number of trees/ha (hectar?). 


So, the farmer gets grants  for the pasture where the cows goes to feed based on the size and the conditions- are you with me so far. To get more grant, for free feeding cows, there needs to be less tree than 50 /unit (I believe that is the measurement, it might be 40 or 60, I can look it up if you want to). 

The problem is, that in Sweden (and Finland, Poland, Lithuania etc) we might not have that many pastures/free grassland to let our cows roam free on. Those we have, are mostly used for crops, actually. Instead, what is most common is ""skogsbete"", which can be translated to ""forest pasturage"". You basically let the cows feed in the forest (although I'd say it is rarerly a dense forest). It might look like [this](http://www.upplandsstiftelsen.se/Temp/9aa7f0930b8558914f2411510b74c995_2a1178e37a789c3795e4ea9c04429201.jpg).

However, since the Swedish farmer is doing that and do not have access to the same open meadows, he gets less per cow *even if* his cows are just as well fed, have been outside just as much or more, even if it is the same sort of cow even, weighing just as much. The problem is, there are to many trees, so the Swedish farmers grant is cut. 

This is due to France writing the rules, of course. Also, they are aware of it, but are (of course) refusing to change it.


See, I did know what I was talking about - and you are an arrogant prick!!!

I'd like for you to explain why Swedish farmers should get less for the land? What is wrong with skogsbete?

We have. Since 1995, when we joined. France always objects. And they are the ones mostly objecting to changing to the CAP, and who has the most weight, so even if its is not them, it *is* them. 

And of course it is minor, but it is a big issue for Swedish farmers (and Finnish//Lithuanian etc). The problem is, there are a lot of rules like this, and all point to the favour of the French. If this is was the only problem with the CAP, I would be happy, but it isn't.  


&gt;what is wrong with skogsbete?

The problem is, they do not have the right to decide that. The EU is not subject to a German court, nor should it be. If the rules are being changed, (which I can understand might happen), then they should be re-written and voted about, just like any other law change. Why can't we do that then?

Besides, I don't see why the hate towards the English papers. I might point out that a lot of Swedish write the same, and a lot of Swedis academics too.

Further - where are the fines that all countries that has broken the stability pact should pay?

Because the other countries all recognized its legality. It was only the German constitutional court that was concerned it was illegal, and after studying it found out it complied with German and EU law. They can't allow a law they know is illegal to be made valid. They determined that it was not in conflict with the Lisbon Treaty, and that's why it was allowed to go into force.

&gt;Further - where are the fines that all countries that has broken the stability pact should pay?

From my understanding, there is no punitive mechanism for such things. It's assumed that such anything that could be illegal would be struck down in a domestic court challenge if brought up. Regardless, what part of the stability pact do you see to be broken?

During the Lisbon negotiations, Sweden could have (as well) been obstructionist until they ironed out the flaws. They didn't because they (presumably), in concert and coalition with other countries, received other benefits as a result. Either that, or they saw no reason to bother with it.

Per esempio una parte può pagare variabile e incassare fisso, ossia pagare un tasso di mercato (tipo Euribor) aumentato di uno spread e incassare, per esempio, il 4%. Gli IRS possono dare luogo a incassi o pagamenti netti, a seconda dell'andamento dei tassi di interesse. Se il tasso variabile sale sopra il 4%, nell'esempio di cui sopra, l'IRS genera esborsi di denaro, se rimane al di sotto del 4% invece si generano incassi. In pratica, da quello che ho capito, i comuni hanno scommesso che i tassi sarebbero rimasti invariati, o che sarebbero scesi, ma hanno perso e sono stati costretti a pagare.

Really? Where? Anyway, then perhaps you know that the Swedish agricultural market was much more deregulated before we joined the EU. Just google ""kritik mot EUs jordbrukspolitik"" at a university library or something, and you will find a lot of things that are wrong with the CAP. 

&gt;Because the other countries all recognized its legality.

They haven't asked all the other countries. There are 25 countries, in theory, set to join the Euro. We haven't been asked, Poland hasn't etc. We agreed to the rules 123 and 125 - not to anything else. Riksdagen has not voted about it. 



&gt;During the Lisbon negotiations, Sweden could have (as well) been obstructionist until they ironed out the flaws. They didn't because they (presumably), in concert and coalition with other countries, received other benefits as a result. Either that, or they saw no reason to bother with it. But it is as much the Swedes fault that such a situation occurs as the French, because they, in the end, agreed to the Lisbon Treaty.

Of course we can't. We are 9 million people, and we would never be allowed to stall the whole thing. I mean, for God's sake, we are being haunted and bad mouthed (I have already been called a free loader) for not joining the FTT and the banking union - could you imagine what would have happened if we have stopped the whole Lisbon treaty? We haven't even stopped the FTT, not just joined in. 




&gt;From my understanding, there is no punitive mechanism for such things. It's assumed that such anything that could be illegal would be struck down in a domestic court challenge if brought up. Regardless, what part of the stability pact do you see to be broken?

You do know that one is not suppose to have a debt of over 60 % of the GDP, a deficit more than 3 % etc?  Greece has broken it since forever, just like Belgium and Italy. Germanyhas broken it since 2003. If you do, you are to pay a fine. Where are the fines? 

They are not being paid because the countries just ignored it, and didn't give a shit. There is no mechanism to force them - what are we supposed to do, invade France? It says however, everything how the countries regards law, rules and regulations- they don't give a shit, at all.

These numbers tell us that, whatever else is wrong with Greece, it is not the laziness of their people.

It only really tells us that workers logged more hours.  That doesn't tell us a lot about how productive people are while on the job, nor does it tell us how many people don't work at all.

Now, as I say, I generally agree with the points being made, and I doubt that the Greeks really are lazy (or at least anywhere near lazy *enough* to be the cause of the country's problems), but the author presents the figures as if they are indisputable proof of this, when the reality is that they are not.",0,1359488697,null,0,false,0,c85s8fs,t3_17i8pa,t1_c85s8fs,t3_17i8pa,null,1431120852,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

I'm pretty sure that if consensus amongst the eurozone countries is that it's legal, then it is legal. Under what sort of consideration could Sweden (or Poland or Lithuania or whoever) contest its legality? And even if they did, they'd be one voice against the rest of the Eurozone. Simply put, it's legal, and that is objective fact at this stage.

true,OldTimeGentleman,null,null,"Ce commentaire (assez large, c'est vrai) relate les arguments les plus standards des athées. Je vais y répondre 1 à 1, car ils valent tous la peine d'être entendu, et leur réponse aussi.

&gt; Famille catho ? Tu es catho. Famille musulmane ? Tu es musulman

Voilà qui est facilement réfutable. Je viens d'une famille Musulmane, élevé athée, mais me voilà Catho. Il est vrai qu'il te faut une connection avec une religion pour te convertir, de la même façon qu'il faut apprendre une leçon avant de la connaître. Mais cela ne veut en aucun ca dire que la religion avec laquelle tu as grandi sera tienne automatiquement.

&gt; Si on ne te parle jamais de Dieu, tu n'y penseras jamais tout seul... 

Non seulement est-ce faux, mais même si c'était vrai, cela n'aurait rien changé. La religion est une révélation de Dieu aux hommes. Si elle n'est pas révélée, on ne peut pas l'inventer -- normal. De la même façon que la science nous révèle que le soleil est une étoile, alors que notre esprit sans éducation nous dirait autre chose. 

Mais pourtant, la grande majorité des peuples du monde ont ou ont eu une religion. Lorsque les Européens ont voyagé en Amérique, ils y ont trouvé des autochtones qui avaient leur propre religion. Pourquoi ? Car nous sommes fait par Dieu, et nous avons cette envie de le chercher. Donne à une civilisation le temps de cogiter, et oui, elle te trouvera une religion.

&gt; C'est marrant cette manie de Dieu de ne pas être très causant, alors que son clergé lui fait dire beaucoup de choses.

Non. Dieu dit très clairement dans la Bible que son esprit fait et fera parler beaucoup de gens, et que les moments où Dieu parle directement sont *extrèmement* rares.

&gt; Les croyants d'aujourd'hui ne voient pas leurs religions comme la mythologie de demain. 

Les religions d'aujourd'hui ne sont pas si récentes. Regarde le Judaisme, qui a au moins 4000 ans. 

&gt; les postulats des religions sont tous mis en défaut par les progrès de la science.

Encore une fois, non. Tu dis cela en partant du principe que la religion est fausse, donc 'remise en cause'. En vérité, la religion et la science se complètent. La science peut reprendre l'Eglise à des moments où elle a tort - sur des doctrines comme l'ethnocentrie, qui ne sont pas infaillibles (en opposition aux doctrines ex Cathedra qui le sont). Mais le plus souvent, elle la complète. Plusieurs théologiens Catholiques avaient dit que l'histoire d'Adam et Eve pouvait être vue comme métaphorique avant l'arrivée de Darwin (Thomas d'Aquin, par exemple). L'Eglise n'est pas en contradiction avec la science (elle accepte l'évolution, par exemple)

&gt; par opposition à une foi qui demande de croire sans poser de questions.

Il n'y a rien de mal à poser des questions et à être ouvert aux réponses. La religion ne t'enchaîne pas, elle te laisse chercher ailleurs. Mais, de la même façon que tu es libre d'explorer les raisons pour lesquelles un chien est un chat, tu es aussi libre d'explorer les raisons pour lesquelles Dieu n'existe pas : comme c'est faux, tu n'as pas de raison de changer de religion pour autant.",0,1359489986,null,0,false,0,c85sp5b,t3_17907i,t1_c85sp5b,t1_c85ll4v,null,1431121086,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

true,kwood09,null,null,"If you do not have an EU passport, there are basically two ways to get into Germany. You can come on a student visa, and after graduation you have a year to find gainful employment. Or you can be hired if you're a specialist/expert. And that means that you have to apply for and be accepted for a position at a German company, and that company has to prove that they couldn't find any workers in the EU willing and able to fill the position. Basically, degrees that are in demand—IT, engineering, etc.,—are required. You can't just show up with a psychology degree and expect a residence permit. (You can also enter Germany to start up a business, but you must invest €500,000 and create at least 5 jobs with your business.) 

Now, if you are an EU citizen, you simply have to apply for a few permits and you're set. Relevant information from Düsseldorf's city government can be found [here.](http://www.duesseldorf.de/auslaenderamt/einreise/index.shtml)

The short answer is that, quite frankly, you can't simply decide to move to a new country and then go do it. You need to have a longterm plan for getting into the country. That usually includes both learning the language and gaining education/skills (if you don't already have them) that will qualify you for an in-demand job that cannot be filled by workers already in the country.

As the storage capacity and speed of our computers grow, so will our need to transfer more data over the internet. 

&gt;You do understand that if there are no patents or copyrights that will only mean that any intellectual property will be so locked down that it will be virtually impossible to distribute it without vendor allowing it?

wtf? Without patents or copyright there would not *be* any intellectual property. Without them, people can do whatever they want with the information in their possession.

**Leibniz-cookie in exchange for a donation: Police is investigating black mailing**

A strange claim of responsibility has appeared in the case of the stolen Leibniz-cookie. A ransom note arrived in the HAZ news room (TN: the newspaper which wrote this article) Tuesday morning, a picture was attached. In that a person in a Cookie Monster costume was holding up the golden cookie. This cookie has been stolen from the head office of Bahlsen in Hannover. (TN: Probably the biggest German cookie producer).  
[Picture](http://imgur.com/AGf8Qp9)

**Hannover**. The HAZ news team gave the anonymous letter to the police. ""Our experts will investigate into the authenticity and plausibility of the letter"", says police spokeswomen Jacobe Heers. The investigators will also determine if this is a case of extortion . It's not yet possible to say when the first results will come in. The police won't speculate about authorship or seriousness of the letter in the moment. But the police takes the case serious. 

The Cookie Monster costume on the picture is sold in carneval shops and online.

The claims of the extortionist are quite reasonable: If Bahlsen wants their famous golden cookie back, they have to deliver free  Leibniz-cookies to all floors of the children hospital Bult (Hannover). The whole milk variation is preferred. Bahlsen should also donate the 1000 Euro reward for the thiefs to the animal shelter in Langenhagen.

The threat in the letter: If Bahlson doesn't comply with these terms, the cookie will end up with ""Oscar in the can"". Oscar is another character from the kids show Sesame Street. The one-paged letter, made with cutten-out letters from newspapers, was signed with Cookie Monster. 

Another letter with the same claims arrived also at Bahlsen today. The legal department of the company is investigating the letter. The Bahlsen spokeswoman says she didn't know if the letter is legitimate: ""That's not a marketing ploy from our company, never ever!"".",0,1359497941,null,0,false,0,c85vlna,t3_17it4n,t1_c85vlna,t3_17it4n,null,1431122441,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

These numbers for the Netherlands and Greece can only be correct if only takes people with an actual job into account.

The lower number can be an indicator of a *good* thing, because regulations here make it rewarding to work part-time and there is a maximum you are allowed to work per week, meaning that more people need to be employed and that wealth gets distributed more evenly, which could in turn results in a stronger economy if there low and middle class have more to spend.

The fastest growing European economy in 2012, so far as I could determine (I may well be wrong, since the statistics are quite hard to find for some reason), was Germany, which has notably not adopted a significant programme of austerity domestically despite pushing for it in other countries. The UK, which did adopt such a policy, has been essentially stagnant, with declining real wages and now an ostensible triple-dip recession. Other countries that have had to adopt austerity policies, as Foxkilt points out, have not fared particularly well either.

But it's an academic point, since growth has nothing directly to do with austerity; austerity is not supposed to make economies grow, it is supposed to stabilise them. The economic problems in Europe are related, I believe, to fiscal policies as such and not simply cutting or increasing spending.

I like a quiet place where the waiter will not pretend to be my friend for a bit of money, where he is efficient and discrete, perhaps a recommendation if asked and eventually strike a bit of a conversation if I'm not coming for the first time and/or their not too much client. he will act as a professional and not as a slave, and at the end I will perhaps give him a tip if I feel he made a special effort to accommodate me, not out of obligation.

[Abstract:](http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/5/539.abstract)

&gt; The paper criticises the currently dominant neo‐liberal discourse on the role of the state and proposes an alternative approach that will allow us to overcome its shortcomings, especially its inadequate analyses of the role of institutions and politics. It argues that the central problem with the neo‐liberal framework lies not in its excessively anti‐interventionist policy conclusions, as some of its critics believe, but in the very ways it envisages the modus operandi of the market, the state, institutions and their interrelationships. The paper then discusses how we may construct the alternative approach of ‘institutionalist political economy’.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"There are some very significant problems with ""pure"" capitalism:

1. Social instability: It is well-known that social inequality breeds more social inequality as well as crime. Capitalism fails to solve this problem.

2. Democratic accountability: Money is power in a capitalist state, yet if money is accumulated in an unregulated manner, power is accumulated by individuals, and those individuals may have interests that conflict with those of the citizens of whatever country.

3. Environment: Capitalism assumes undepletable natural resources (mostly because it was invented at a time when humanity was not even near the limit of the planet's resources). Theoretically, it accommodates the scarcity of, say, oil through the market price, but the market price does not reflect secondary effects of burning oil. And that's just one example — capitalism generally does not take effects into account that aren't directly present in the relationship between buyer and seller, with potentially catastrophic consequences.

As such, capitalism *by itself* is not a suitable structure for human civilisation in the long run, particularly not in the face of globalisation. Nobody is suggesting socialism as known in the 20th century — that would be madness, obviously — but what most Western democracies implement today is not capitalism, but a hybrid: Maintaining the incentive structures of capitalism, while regulating some of the problematic aspects outlined above.

Scandinavia is particularly strong on points 1 and 3, but not nearly enough on point 2, and it's kind of pointless to try point 3 without *everyone* on board — this is why we need supranational organisations such as the EU and even the UN.

Some are naturally stronger, faster, more gifted at mathematics, better looking, etc etc. They would naturally do better than average in the areas that they have advantage in. Likewise some are naturally slow, ugly, may suffer from disabilities or other problems which leave them at a disadvantage compared to the societal average.

Society can (and in most Western countries does) help compensate those who are actively disadvantaged from birth such as the disabled, by using social spending to help compensate for their disadvantages. 

The part a lot of people struggle with, and Western society perhaps hasn't worked out how to deal with, is whether and how we level the playing field for those naturally better off. It wouldn't be practical to raise everyone up to the highest possible standard in every respect, so do we drag those who are naturally gifted down to the lowest common denominator, or do we accept that inequality is part of nature and some will always be better off than others? 

You can throw inherited wealth into the equation if you like, but unless you impose a 100% death tax and tell parents that the can't leave anything for their children, some people will always inherit more financially than others, the same as some will inherit better genes than others. Again, how do we solve this? Should the state give everyone a £100k lump sum on birth to raise the average up to the highest possible standard? It could be argued that providing a baseline state education and welfare spending to minimise child poverty, this is already done to an extent, though it certainly doesn't level the playing field completely. So should we seek to drag down those who are advantaged by the fact that they have wealthy parents by having the state remove all their parents wealth and prevent it being passed on?

That's very nice. Improve to what?

I mean, seriously, what exact measures do we need to take? How can you possibly improve the system?

&gt;Another point is that we don't need someone to control us.

We don't, capitalism proved that and even more, that not only we don't need control but also that the best system is this one where people are free to pursue their own interests and not the goals given to them by those in charge.

&gt;You replace slave masters with feudal lords. Then you replace feudal lords with capitalists.

The comparison is just ludicrous. Feudal lords and slave masters treated their serfs as property, they were like the oxen and the machines, not like fellow human beings.

This in comparison with capitalism where you only work for whom you want to work and where you can just as well be the employer as opposed to the employee, I really don't know why you think people are being exploited like that, after all, in a capitalistic system, only if both parties agree to it that there's a transaction. Our ancestors which were serfs and slaves would roll in their graves if they heard us cry about oppression when we're in a system in which we're all free to do what we want.

&gt;But you don't replace capitalists with angels. You replace capitalists with people governing themselves. Which they will be quite capable of, given the right tools (the internet.)

Every non-capitalist country in history *has become capitalist*. There's no real way to determine the comparative virtues of ""capitalism"" -- it's a self-reproducing system that has never been successfully abolished in any of the places it's taken root. Even the Soviet Union didn't successfully abolish the accumulation of capital for its own sake, which is the essential aspect of capitalism. This is why it's appropriate to talk of ""state capitalism"" there. 

But as for ""free markets""? Well, I can think of an immediate counterexample, and it's a field in which Ha-Joon Chang has worked, like I mention elsewhere here. South Korea. The developmental state in South Korea in the 1960s and 70s was about as far away from a classical ""free market"" as you can get. It was managed by state planning agencies and the ruthless enforcement of discipline on businesses that refused to cooperate with state demands. (One early example: during the junta period of 1961-3, Ku Inhoe, the founder of Lucky-Goldstar, wanted to set up a textile factory. The junta wanted him to set up a cable factory. Solution? Ku was disciplined and he damn well built the cable factory -- which would become Lucky-Goldstar's base for its evolution as a conglomerate.)

For all the political oppression of this period -- and I argue this oppression was actually a central aspect of the development policy, because it was based on transforming Korean society through harsh discipline -- the net result for the economy was undoubtedly positive: vast economic growth, social development, etc. In fact, it was only after the developmental state was dismantled by American demand, beginning straight after Park Chung-hee's death in 1979, that crisis set in and the ""miracle"" ended.

Who knows... Maybe it doesn't have a name yet. My bet is on anarchy though. 

&gt;what exact measures do we need to take? How can you possibly improve the system?

It's basically just decentralisation. Where you once had a few very rich, very powerful people in charge of everything (capitalists), you now distribute that power to many different people, removing the possibility of abuse of power. 

Instead of Facebook, Twitter and Google being in charge of social media, you have lots of regular people running Diaspora pods, MediaGoblin and so on.

Instead of Microsoft and Apple being in charge of operating systems, all the developers work on creating free and libre open source software, where no central institution is in control. 

Instead of banks we use Bitcoins. 

Instead of big news companies we have bloggers and the like, being paid directly by readers and listeners. 

Instead of the postal services we have e-mail. 

Instead of Hollywood and big publishers controlling entertainment, we have individual artists and creators being paid directly by consumers. 

General formula: Take something which has a lot of power concentrated in a small place, take that power and hand it out to everyone. 

That means every CEO, every boss, every king, every president, every minister and every publicly elected politician. It also means priests and bishops and his holiness the pope. 

Is there a company which has power to control the infrastructure in an area? Give that power to the people living there. 

Is some guy owning a factory, controlling it, and taking all the profits for himself? Give that factory and the control over it to the people working in it.

This is how we improve it.

&gt;that not only we don't need control but also that the best system is this one where people are free to pursue their own interests and not the goals given to them by those in charge.

A capitalist who owns the means of production is in charge. He controls things. Him alone. That is not a good thing.

&gt;The comparison is just ludicrous. Feudal lords and slave masters treated their serfs as property, they were like the oxen and the machines, not like fellow human beings.

&gt;This in comparison with capitalism where you only work for whom you want to work and where you can just as well be the employer as opposed to the employee, I really don't know why you think people are being exploited like that, after all, in a capitalistic system, only if both parties agree to it that there's a transaction. Our ancestors which were serfs and slaves would roll in their graves if they heard us cry about oppression when we're in a system in which we're all free to do what we want.

[Could you do me a favour and read this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/historicalrage/comments/15gyhf/greece_in_ww2/c7mdoxw)

&gt;So you'll replace capitalism with capitalism?

&gt;What exactly is people governing themselves if not capitalism

Instead of capitalists (rich, powerful people in charge of companies and such) being in control of everything, you give control of everything to the workers. The workers could use democracy to agree on how they want to run things. 

People governing themselves, without a king, slave master or boss, is called anarchy.

I'm also a supporter of democracy but it's not my business to have a say in other people's lives. When it regards society like our foreign policy, our justice system and so on, sure, we should all have a vote. When it's about the business Mr. Smith started up, I have no business whatsoever in having a say on what he does as long as it doesn't harm anybody else. If he's free to do as he pleases and he can only survive if he provides a service other people are willing to pay for, then that's the only way to assure the whole society can benefit.

&gt;Is there a company which has power to control the infrastructure in an area? Give that power to the people living there. 

If they paid for it, let them. Or would you like me to move into your house and claim it as my own?

&gt;Is some guy owning a factory, controlling it, and taking all the profits for himself? Give that factory and the control over it to the people working in it.

If he or his parents were the ones who built it, why should the workers have it? They already have their wages, if they are displeased with the situation then they can all find employment elsewhere or start they their own company. What you're suggesting would in reality lead people to only hire relatives, that's hardly promoting anything good.

&gt;A capitalist who owns the means of production is in charge. He controls things. Him alone. That is not a good thing.

What's so wrong about it? If you don't like him, then you don't do business with him, you build better means of production.

&gt;Could you do me a favour and read this?

I'm familiar with Marxism, thank you very much.

You watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWsx1X8PV_A), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmqoCHR14n8) and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5Gppi-O3a8).

&gt;Instead of capitalists (rich, powerful people in charge of companies and such) being in control of everything, you give control of everything to the workers.

You're talking as if people were born capitalists or they were born workers and there is no way to climb or fall down the social ladder.

Regardless, no, you don't give away other people's property. That has been done time and time again in other countries and it's no accident that these countries are the countries which have gone through the most poverty and the most inequality.

&gt;The workers could use democracy to agree on how they want to run things. 

Everybody already used democracy to agree on how to run things. Even better, with a free market, you and your brother want bacon and I want ham, I can buy ham and you can buy bacon whereas in a system which you're proposing, I wouldn't satisfy my needs. Democracy shouldn't be about the dictatorship of the majority, it should be about the power of the people to choose as they see fit is best for themselves and for society, not how they see fit to choose for their neighbours.

&gt;People governing themselves, without a king, slave master or boss, is called anarchy. 

I have no king, no slave master and no boss and yet I'm not in an anarchy.

&gt;Capitalism is the opposite of people governing themselves. Capitalism means that it's the capitalists who are in charge. 

The thing is that everybody is a capitalist. Do you happen to have capital? If so, then you're a capitalist yourself, you're in charge, you do as you see fit with your own money.

If you use it to buy things for yourself, if you use it to loan out to other people, if you use it to build a factory and invest it, it doesn't matter, it is your own choice and you bear the cost and you'll have the benefits. That's how it should be, that's capitalism.",0,1359508288,null,0,false,0,c85yuwh,t3_17i8pa,t1_c85yuwh,t1_c85yftg,null,1431123984,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I also don't think this makes him a ""Marxist"" as he doesn't call for removing all inequality (see 2nd quote below) of income per se and doesn't use any of the typical Marxist patterns of argument.

And there's no way you can convince me that he means the ""natural"" type of inequality (i.e. individual abilities that differ from person to person). Otherwise, these sentences: 

- ""by reducing everything down to individuals, it draws people's attention *away* from the structural causes of poverty and inequality."" (... and thereby *towards* the alleged cause: unequal distribution of talents, character etc.)

and

- ""All of this is not to say that individual talents and efforts should not be rewarded."" (which clearly implies he accepts the notion of there being different talents, abilities etc. as a natural given)

would simply make no sense. The point of the article is that economic inequality is *not* created by certain natural traits/abilities of individual people (i.e. some don't have the ability to work hard, are lazy) but by societal structures.

What else could it be? Divine intervention? Of course gender, race etc. are also ""natural"", but what they lead to is determined by social circumstances. They don't matter to inequality in their *natural* form, only if they become *social*, that is if a society makes them matter - for example to income if women systematically get less money for the same work.

The argument that the poor people are repsonsible for their poverty is old and tired. Yes some may be lazy/dumb etc. (then again, what is ""dumb"", isn't this caused in large party by social circumstances as well? by poor families not able to affort good education?). But would we have an (almost) equal society if everybody was exactly the same, with the same motivations, intelligence, ability etc.? No, because in a capitalist society some people *need* to be less wealthy, simply because the economy is organized in a way that some people own the modes of production and ""exploit"" (I use this term without any negative or positive connotation) the workers to some degree to make profit (that simply means that there will be a margin between the value of the product sold and the amount paid to the workers, i.e. profit), which is an imperative caused by competition. And depending on how the economic system is organized in detail (i.e. welfare measures, worker's rights, taxes) the income gap will be bigger or smaller, e.g. full on, unregulated capitalism will most likely lead to circumstances like during the industrial revolution/pauperism etc. Just as an example. However, a society organized in a completely different way that would *not* lead to instituionalized income inequality (or only really small inequality) is definitely imaginable. It's just that capitalism has the tendency to present its mechanisms as laws of nature, when in reality they're as historical and contingent as everything else created by man.

The term ""intellectual property"" is stupid. Lumping various ideas into one broad term just confuses things. Using that term means that one sets up a conceptual space where one can't see the serious problems - and benefits - of each of the things that are called ""intellectual property"".

A trade secret and a patent are pretty much polar opposites, and yet are both lumped under the same term. What does a database right and a personality right actually have in common? And what do either of them have in common with plant breeder's rights?

That doesn't mean that Greeks are lazy (more on that later) but in Greece (in the public sector) it wouldn't be uncommon for someone to go at work at 10 am and 5 hours later find some excuse to leave and do the grocery shopping or ""drink a coffee"", yet still when the questionaire comes you just tick the 8 hours a day box and that's it you are the most hardworking in the planet. Or how about those employee review papers that are being handed out, on a scale of 1 to 10 the chances of not being rated a 10 are ZERO. If a public sector employee gets something other than a 10 on these everyone we'll be like ""what was he, a pedophille?"".

All the middle school teachers that by an amount of 95+% never work more than 22 hours a week? On paper they just work for 40.  It's  why Greeks have long had a phrase to describe how certain things worked, ""oti dilosis ise"" which translates to ""You are whatever you officialy declare you are"". 

Off course the problem is not the ""laziness"" but the corruption. They just hire more people than needed and often create work out of nothing to justify their presence. There are probably around 1000 cops in Greece who's job is to spend days preparing and sending mails to each other for some useless beaurocratic procedure that could have been finished in an hour using some kind of website. Or say the municipal office decides to let people rent a dozen bikes at some park, they really need 1 person to do this, well since it is a good sounding excuse they'll just hire 20 (their most zealous voters of course) let them work an average of 2 hours a week and pay them a full wage.

And a second problem is the lack of competition/ organization/ long term planning / willingness to go the extra mile etc. The top 10% and bottom 50% of the greek university students are in the same level as in the rest of Europe. The problem is the middle 40% didn't give a shit and expected to call up their aunt who knows politician X and get some job in the public sector and never have to deal with competition or doing anything too involved for their entire lives.

true,gezar,null,null,"Io però due paroline sul programma e democrazia interne vorrei dirle. Il programma M5S è ingenuo e soprattutto incompleto. Non spiegano come concretamente attuare tutte quelle belle cose che dicono di voler fare. Sulla democrazia interna meglio non indagare troppo, ma un partito più personalistico di quello di Grillo è difficile trovarne (forse dietro solo al PDL).
Il tuo post prescinde da questi elementi, che invece io considero fondamentali. Quindi mi sembra giusto rimarcarli.

Entrando nel merito. Dici che finalmente verrà introdotta in Parlamento molta gente che non fa il politico di mestiere. Ok, il ricambio ci vuole, soprattutto quando l'età media in parlamento è molto alta, e alcuni personaggi sembrano essere incrostati ai loro scranni. Bene, ma siamo sicuri che mandarci ""gente della strada"", gente come me, te, mia madre, il mio vicino di casa, sia cosa buona e giusta? Non credo. In parlamento vorrei vedere persone preparate, gente che sa cosa va a votare, gente che ha familiarità con l'economia (sì, di questi tempi bisogna averci a che fare), che sappia cosa succede nel mondo, in Europa, sappia qualche lingua (giusto l'inglese,dai), che sia degna e mantenga l'onore del compito che gli viene affidato etc etc. Insomma fare il parlamentare lo vedo come un lavoro molto qualificato, al quale ci si arriva di solito dopo aver almeno una laurea in tasca. Poi questo non misura l'onestà, e non è tutto. Verissimo, però sarebbe un buon punto di partenza. Non è un discorso classista il mio, ma visto che la politica influisce sulla mia vita, e visto che ne ho una e pure corta di vita, voglio gente preparata che ci metta le mani. 

Credo sia questa la critica più importante da fare al M5S. Eleggere i nostri stessi simili, non ci tirerà fuori dai guai, anzi... D'altra parte non è quello che è successo negli ultimi 20 anni? Ancora si insegue il mito della società civile, linda, pulita, ONESTA e incorruttibile? Ah, la società civile sì che è meglio della politica... Dispiace constatarlo ma la politica è diretta espressione della società civile.
 
Inoltre dici: «*è da pochissimo che, grazie alle nuove tecnologie della comunicazione, siamo nel primo periodo storico in cui probabilmente una democrazia assai più vicina al suo significato etimologico sarebbe possibile*» Democrazia diretta? E come? Con l'internet? Se trovi un modo fammi un fischio eh... Senza entrare troppo nel dettaglio, la democrazia diretta è un abbaglio, sia tecnicamente, sia umanamente in una società di milioni e milioni di persone ognuno con la propria testa. Sai, non tutti poi hanno voglia di occuparsi di politica ogni giorno. C'è anche chi vive la propria vita, e preferisce delegare le decisioni sulla regolamentazione del vivere comune proprio alla politica che serve a questo appunto.

«*gente che è gente e non classe politica*» Qui manca la logica però. Appena gli eletti del M5S siederanno in parlamento magicamente diventeranno la famosa ""classe politica"". Guarda un po'. 

No, il M5S non ci salverà dal pantano in cui siamo, anzi...non farà che peggiorare le cose. Come tutti i partiti nati sull'onda della protesta, del noi-non-siamo-come-voi, la-gente-è-stufa.

Don't bother coming after 8pm, the place will be packed wall to wall. Nice place to start an evening, though.

- Another nice place for good cocktails is the *Bar des Pirates*. It's the original hole in the wall (there are exactly two tables), but the staff is cool, the drinks are great and the regular crowd is fun.

- If you want to hear live music, head up Oberkampf and check out the *International*. Big place, bands/DJs most nights. Drinks are cheapish but not very good.

- Next door to the *International* is the *Cantada*. This one is for discerning customers; it's sort of a Goth bar/restaurant. The main attraction, though, is their absinthe...they've got a big selection and knowledgeable staff. Spending the evening there feels like your tongue just took a carpet bombing...be warned, though, so will your wallet.

This has been going on for a while. The problem is that these arguably trivial cases are picked up by the media more than the bigger issues we have with sexism. The article mentions women getting paid 22% less for the same work on average, but that's all it has to say about that. The fact is brought up regularly, but people who are actually working to fix it don't get the same kind of publicity as someone who gets complimented on her figure. As a man I've been asked to get something for someone ""because I look like a strong man"" often enough, I would never dream of complaining about that (especially since I am in fact not particularly strong, so this is clearly people trying to be nice and polite). It's not 100% the same thing, but if we keep adding relatively harmless issues to our definition of sexism, we're both trivializing the actual problem, and distracting from it.

&gt; Je viens d'une famille Musulmane, élevé athée, mais me voilà Catho.

Élevé laïque je dirais, mais je joue sur les mots. Sans être indiscret, quelles sont les raisons qui font que l'on change une religion pour une autre ? 

&gt; Mais cela ne veut en aucun ca dire que la religion avec laquelle tu as grandi sera tienne automatiquement.

Là, c'est toi qui joue sur les mots, tu sais bien que ton cas est une exception. La plupart des musulmans sont nés de parents musulmans, les cathos sont nés de parents cathos... Ce n'est pas une critique, c'est un constat ; les religions sont partie prenante des civilisations qui les ont vu naître, et elles font partie de ce que les parents transmettent à leurs enfants. Libre à eux d'accepter cet héritage ou pas (accepter la religion, la rejeter, en prendre une autre)

&gt; Lorsque les Européens ont voyagé en Amérique, ils y ont trouvé des autochtones qui avaient leur propre religion. Pourquoi ? Car nous sommes fait par Dieu, et nous avons cette envie de le chercher. Donne à une civilisation le temps de cogiter, et oui, elle te trouvera une religion.

Non, c'est parce que nous sommes nus et faibles face à la mort, que l'on sait très tôt que l'on va mourir -la seule incertitude est ""quand ?""- et que la religion est une béquille ontologique. Oui, le sentiment religieux est indissociable de l'humain ; j'aimerais croire qu'il appartient au passé et que nous n'avons plus besoin, c'est ce qui fait la différence de nos façons de voir le monde. 

Pour ce qui est des autochtones, nous nous sommes empressés de faire rentrer dans le crâne des survivants qu'ils avaient grand tort de ne pas embrasser la religion que leurs exterminateurs leur apportaient...

&gt; Non. Dieu dit très clairement dans la Bible[...]

La Bible (mais aussi la Torah, le Coran, les haddiths, les actes des apôtres...) a été écrite par des *hommes*. Pas par Dieu. Ça fait partie des choses qui me hérissent (désolé) dans les discussions avec des croyants : ""oui, mais c'est écrit dans la Bible""... Ah, et alors ? Si tu ""oublies"" une seconde ta foi, tu es bien obligé d'admettre que ce qui écrit -où que ce soit- n'est pas forcément vrai. Ce qui est dans le journal, tu es capable de le remettre en cause. Mais la Bible, ou le Coran, tu ne le remets pas en cause. Pourquoi ? Cf. le point précédent : parce qu'on t'a dit tout petit que c'était la *vérité révélée* et que le remettre en cause fout par terre toutes tes certitudes et tes confortables assurances vis à vis de la mort.

&gt; Les religions d'aujourd'hui ne sont pas si récentes. Regarde le Judaisme, qui a au moins 4000 ans. 

Joliment botté en touche. ;)  Ceci dit, les juifs se sont servis de leur religion pour survivre en tant que peuple, que culture etc. car c'est tout ce qu'ils avaient ; cela renvoie a posteriori l'image d'une ""doctrine"" unifiée alors qu'il n'en est rien ; ou du moins qu'il n'en était rien il y a 2000 ans. C'est au début de la diaspora qu'ils ont été obligés d'unifier leurs références pour ne pas disparaitre.

&gt; Mais le plus souvent, elle la complète. Plusieurs théologiens Catholiques avaient dit que l'histoire d'Adam et Eve pouvait être vue comme métaphorique avant l'arrivée de Darwin (Thomas d'Aquin, par exemple). L'Eglise n'est pas en contradiction avec la science (elle accepte l'évolution, par exemple)

Chapeau. C'est en lisant ça que je me dis que tu n'es pas aussi ""extrêmiste"" que tu voudrais le faire croire. Mais pour autant, il y a une contradiction dans cette attitude : la démarche scientifique, c'est tout soumettre à la preuve, tout (re)mettre en question ; il n'y a pas de ""vérités scientifiques"" comme il y a des ""vérités d'évangile"" : il n'y a que des hypothèses infirmées ou confirmées. Et je ne comprends pas comment l'on peut ainsi séparer son esprit en deux moitiés fonctionnant différemment : une moitié ""scientifique"", doutant du monde et cherchant des explications rationnelles à ce qu'il ne sait pas expliquer ; une moitié ""religieuse"" acceptant des dogmes impossibles à soumettre à la démarche scientifique, invérifiables, non reproductibles et souvent en contradiction complète avec les connaissances acquises par la première moitié... Je ne vais pas me lancer dans une longe suite d'exemples, mais tu vois ce que je veux dire. L'immaculée conception ? Absurde à tous les points de vue. Le chrétien l'accepte, l'obstétricien se marre. 

Comment pouvez-vous ne pas avoir ""peur"" de voir votre foi peu à peu grignotée par la science ? La position de l'Église a longtemps été la fermeture la plus totale - et la plus abjecte : Inquisition, torture, bûchers de livres et de gens... Je ne suis pas d'accord (heureusement !) mais je trouve cette démarche logique : je lutte contre tout ce qui serait susceptible de remettre en cause mes fondements, et donc mon existence. 

Mais l'attitude des ""progressistes"" m'étonne : remettre en cause la Bible sur certains points, n'est ce pas mettre le doigt dans l'engrenage ? Comment pouvez-vous faire des choix et dire : ""ok, Adam et Eve c'est du symbole, le déluge aussi, les 7 plaies d'Egypte il y a des explications rationnelles, le vin changé en eau, on est pas trop sûrs, mais la vierge Marie et la résurrection, c'est sûr-sûr-sûr"" ? Il n'y a pas tellement de logique là dedans... Et pour revenir à Adam et Eve, c'est un conte étiologique, mais le pêché originel à l'intérieur de ce conte demeure réel ? Comment le fondement de toute une philosophie peut-il se placer à l'intérieur de quelque chose par ailleurs reconnu comme faux ?

On en revient encore une fois à ce que j'ai déjà dit à plusieurs reprises : les croyants pratiquent une lecture sélective. Les modérés ou les progressistes pour justifier la coexistence de la science et de la religion, ou de leur religion avec celle des autres ; les intégristes (mot intéressant d'ailleurs : ils veulent rester ""intègres""...) pour justifier de convertir ou tuer les infidèles ou pour trouver des réponses différentes, et donc meilleures, que celles apportées par la science.

&gt; La religion ne t'enchaîne pas, elle te laisse chercher ailleurs. [...] tu es aussi libre d'explorer les raisons pour lesquelles Dieu n'existe pas : comme c'est faux [...]

This is not to say that there can not be a correlation between personal attributes and success. But it is not as simple as: Work two times harder and you earn two times more.

Since we have a society with private ownership over limited resources, there is an inherent hierarchy in our social structure: Those with access to the limited resources are better off than those who are not. An intelligent businessperson might be able to get into the group of owners. Most people are instead forced to work for the owners instead, because of how limited resources are distributed. Without control over resources like land, factories, technology you are not as much in charge of your ""destiny"", it is rather self-evident.

So what we have is a hierarchy where whoever is at the top has the power to extract more money from the system than people at the bottom. Whether you end up at the top or bottom depends to some degree on your personal 'productivity'. But the levels of rewards at the various levels are not based on how important or productive you are. They are simply various degrees of power, and which ""row"" you end up in is determined by how many people you successfully compete against. These people will end up below you.

A clearer comparison I often use: Imagine a kingdom, with a king. The king has a billion times more wealth than anyone else, most other people are farmers. But this is a ""meritocratic"" kingdom, where the most productive farmer becomes king, and can then rule over all others. Is the system fair simply because the autocratic king actually *was* more productive than everyone else?

Now, if we include things like inheritance into the equation... Or systemic poverty because you are born in an area/family with lack of resources and social issues that hinder your personal development... Is it not clear what the cause of poverty is?

To spell it out: Power. Our societal structure is hierarchical and demands that most people have no control over limited resources, so that they instead work for someone else. In this powerless situation, they have little control over their personal fortune.

Unless they unite, try to change politics and struggle against the system through unions etc. But these struggles have faded, partly because of a neo-liberal ideological wind, that has convinced people that the free market is best if left alone.",0,1359538069,null,0,false,0,c866kuo,t3_17i8pa,t1_c866kuo,t1_c85s4pt,null,1431127774,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,SimonGray,DENK,Nørrebro,"&gt;I admit I'm not familiar with the South Korean case. It sounds interesting, I must read up on it. However, I doubt it would be enough to really validate central planning as a long-term system, as the evidence to the contrary is vast and undisputed in modern economics.

This is exactly why you must read up on it. The evidence is actually _not_ to the contrary. Usually Japan and the Asian tigers like Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong will be the held up as the evidence that opening up markets is the way to develop an economy. But this view is misguided, perhaps with the exception of Hong Kong which is a special case due to its past colonial ownership.

Korea, Japan, and Singapore are actually the best examples of countries with _deliberately_ closed markets that have or had comprehensive state development plans and high tariffs on all the important goods and example after example of the government picking winners. And they are the biggest economic growth stories in history, but of course are being superceded now by China which is also a developmental state and largely state-owned economy with limited market access.

This is not saying that open markets are bad, but the narrative that state absence is the recipe for succes is one of the biggest untruths in economic advocacy. I actually took a couple of Economics classes in Yonsei University in Seoul about economic history and developmental economics and while I already had studied the subject before that, it basically solidified my views. Development is a different stage from developed and the Washington Consensus can honestly be thrown out of the window while a country is still in that process.

Originally terms like ""racism"" , ""sexism"" mean a personal negative emotion / opinion about a group.  Now some people are trying to redefine it like ""anything that happens to disadvantage a group"", but IMHO this redefinition is wrong because:

1) the original meaning usually also includes irrational, unsupported opinion, while the new meaning not necessarily, exactly in this case it is ""rational self-interest"", kind of

2) instead of a personal, individual moral decision, a vice, the new definition is a more vague social thing. This makes the moral ascept of it all confused: i.e. I certainly will not see whether an opinion is moral or immoral based on how it will affect a group generally in society, because I don't expect people to always have some kind of ""social consciousness"". Instead I will see whether an opinion is moral based on how individual directly deal with each other. 

The worst part is that it misdirects social action. Calling it sexist sounds like ""someone needs to learn not hate women"". But it is totally not the case. The employer in question does not hate women: he hates spending money in general. So for example a ""do not hate women training course"" would be entirely useless. So it is an entirely different thing that needs different action.

Finally, it is not even a protection issue. When one gender gets a special privilege by law, it is entirely logical and expectable that general greed or self-interest will have a backlash on it.

Logically enough, the way to achieve equality is, like, literally equal treatment: for example if maternity and paternity leaves would be entirely the same, then the problem would go away by itself and there would be no need for special protection and the general identity group dynamics. 

I find it confusing how it is not obvious. It is basically identity group politics generating the backlash and the need for itself. One gender gets a special privilege. Naturally there is a backlash. If your solution is another kind of special privilege, it generates only more backlash. Then another special thing, another backlask. The solution is not to heap one special privilege upon the other.

Do you think that had something to do with the entire third world being locked out of the European market, due to price controls, tariffs and subsidies to European farmers, so they're unable to develop their own agricultural sector, improve their efficiency via modern farming techniques and so forth, hence when there's a shortage of cereal crops in one location worldwide prices are seriously affected as supply is unduly constrained due to production being concentrated in certain locations because of market distortions caused by fundamentalist statists like you?

Of course not.  That has absolutely nothing to do with it, right?

Let's not even get on to your absurdly narrow definition of ""food security"".  It's entirely reasonable that agriculture in Europe could be hit by some form of disease or blight, severely hampering out ability to produce food.  We are a small continent after all, and we're living right in the midst of a botanical disease sweeping Europe, with ash dieback.  And then what?  Well thanks to the actions of protectionist retards like you, worldwide supply lines aren't designed to ramp up supply to Europe quickly enough, nor are vast stretches of fertile farmland in the third world properly developed in order to take over from their more efficient European counterparts.

Watching the crisis in Europe I cannot help but recall the drama that unfolded in Asia in 1997 and 1998. Fear of insolvency seized Bangkok and spread to Jakarta, Seoul and Kuala Lumpur, triggering fiery protests and chasing off investors. The total value of the Thai stock market fell to $30bn – less than Chrysler’s market capitalisation.
Today, in equity market terms at least, peripheral Europe is suffering a similar fate. At $42bn, the aggregate capitalisation of the Greek stock market is less than Costco, the US warehouse discount store. The same basic arithmetic applies to Ireland, Spain, Portugal and even Italy, where the stock market now has a total value about the same as Apple’s.

The point is not to disparage troubled Europe, quite the opposite. There is value in many of these markets. Since hitting their bottom in 1998 east Asian markets have surged tenfold in dollar terms, marking that year as a huge buying opportunity. The question is whether peripheral Europe is at a similar inflection point.
In statistical terms, peripheral European markets have surpassed the lows typical of regional crises since Latin America’s in the 1990s. On average, the maximum decline in the stock market has been 85 per cent in the country where the crisis began and 65 per cent across the region as a whole. Greece’s market, where the eurozone crisis started, had fallen 90 per cent at its lowest point, while the average decline for peripheral Europe was 70 per cent.
But the Asian crisis has more than just statistical echoes in today’s eurozone. In order to appear safer places to lend and invest, both regions had fixed exchange rates – Asia in the form of currencies pegged to the dollar and peripheral Europe through the euro. The plan worked almost too well. As interest rates fell locals borrowed to shop, build houses and erect factories. The debt binge drove current accounts – the broadest measure of trade – into deficit, stirring fears about whether these countries could pay their debts. When doubts peaked in one country – Thailand in Asia, Greece in Europe – contagion spread.
Compared with the trend in gross domestic product growth in the decade preceding the crisis, Greek GDP is now 28 per cent lower than expected, similar to Thailand which at its low was 30 per cent below trend; Ireland is as hard hit as Indonesia, while Spain, 16 per cent off trend, is 3 percentage points worse off than Malaysia.
The big difference is the speed of recovery: Asia had surpassed its pre-crisis output within four years, but Europe has not. Why? Because Asia simply abandoned the dollar peg, and as the region’s currencies crashed, Asian exports became more competitive, sparking a recovery. Asia also had the advantage of recovering in a period of strong global growth. Peripheral Europe does not have any such global tailwinds and cannot just abandon the euro. The region can regain competitiveness only by tolerating a collapse in wages and employment. This process is slow and difficult.
The Asian experience shows that one of the strongest signals of recovery in crisis-torn countries is the return of the current account to surplus. That is the point when the economy is generating the income to pay down foreign debts. By early 1998 – when pundits were casting east Asia’s troubles as a threat to the global economy – the end was in sight because current account balances were back in surplus.
Peripheral Europe is approaching the same point. Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy are on track to shift into current account surplus next year. Europe is also making the necessary, painful adjustment in labour costs. Measured from recent peaks, unit labour costs have fallen roughly 7 per cent in Spain, Portugal and Greece. The star, however, is Ireland where a 17-percentage-point swing has created the first current account surplus in peripheral Europe at 9 per cent of GDP. Unit labour costs, meanwhile, are down 18 per cent from their peak.
In Asia the toughest reformers, namely Indonesia and South Korea, enjoyed the strongest recoveries; there are signs the same will be true in Europe, with Ireland the only peripheral economy on track to post positive GDP growth this year.
The recovery in Europe will come. Today, the average ratio of stock market value to GDP worldwide is about 80 per cent; in peripheral Europe, this ratio ranges from 23 per cent in Greece to 38 per cent in Portugal, close to where their Asian counterparts were in 1998. One way to think about the future of Europe is to ponder this question: can Italy be worth no more than Apple?

There would be an enormous difference in one and five year survival rates, even though nothing has actually changed. Clearly early diagnosis is important, but the measure they use is an imprecise measure of outcomes.

No, the issue is wholly different, all the unemployed in Spain don't have work because the government intervention has restricted the market and driven away those who otherwise would invest in Spain.

Maternity and paternity leave being the same is a way that society can prevent women from being discriminated by employers. In this we are protecting women, but the companies are not going to like it, because that makes every potential candidate, men or women, less profitable than before this law passed. The companies might start preferring to hire homosexuals, then, because they have a much higher chance of not getting pregnant. Then it will become a discrimination against heterosexuals...

It is not easy to achieve equality because there is no real equality in the world. The companies will always find a way to go around the law for maximum profit.

What? How could they possibly do that? How would more taxes and so on benefit them?

I have a bunch of heterodox guys on my to-do list. They don't have definitive answers, but they're less opinionated and their models are more dynamic.

http://heterodoxnews.com/hed/intro/#13_HETERODOX_CRITIQUE_OF_MAINSTREAM_ECONOMICS

&gt; Mainstream economics is a clearly defined theoretical story about how the economy works; but this story is theoretically incoherent. That is, **mainstream theory is comprised of a core set of propositions such as scarcity, equilibrium, rationality, preferences, and methodological individualism and derivative beliefs, vocabulary, symbols and parables, while there is a range of heterogeneous theoretical developments beyond the core that do not call into question the core itself in totality**. As a result, critiques of the theory vary in that they can deal with the internal coherence and/or empirical grounding of the theory, can be directed at the theory at a particular point in time or at specific components of theory (such as methodology, concepts qua vocabulary, parables qua stories, and symbols), and can be initiated from a particular heterodox approach. What emerges is a varied but concatenate of particular and extensive critiques that generate an emergent encompassing rejection of mainstream theory, although any one particular critique may not go that far.

&gt; Although the internal and story qua model critiques show that the theory is incoherent, *they do not by themselves differentiate mainstream from heterodox theory*. This, however, can be dealt with in terms of specific critiques of the core propositions. That is, each of the heterodox approaches has produced critiques of particular core propositions of the theory, while each core proposition has been subject to more than one critique; in addition, the multiple heterodox critiques of a single proposition overlap in argumentation.",0,1359548374,null,0,false,0,c867plg,t3_17i8pa,t1_c867plg,t1_c86745i,null,1431128296,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Spain is not a federal state where it's clear what is the responsibility of the central government and what's for each state/lander. Instead, the central government can give any ""competence"" (social security, education, etc.) to an autonomous community, but it keeps the power to legislate how it has to be done and also determines how much money it wants to give to implement it. Also, the central gov. collects all taxes.

So where did it go wrong? Well, let's say education in a region costs the central gov. 100M€. The central gov can go to that region and say ""Hey, from now on you take care of education, we'll give you 70M€ to do it. Oh, and you also have to pay for the central Education Ministry, as it's the one telling you how to do it."" This transfers a lot of debt to the autonomous community, and there's nothing they can do about it.

The exceptions are the Basque Country and Navarre, as they have a special deal where they collect all taxes and then pay Spain for ""services rendered"": The military, foreign affairs, etc.

tl;dr: Spain's decentralization was shoddy at best and a con job at worst. It transferred debt to the autonomous communities in a way they couldn't control.

This doesn't seem to have happened too much in the past but in theory this could bring the exact opposite of your problem ""why would anyone want to reduce the state spending?"" why would the politicians want to raise taxes? Even if it's beneficial to the population in the long run. (Better funded education/scientific research and such for example) The public more often then not seems to be blind to this fact. (""I have to pay more/for other people. This sucks hurr durr"") Hell it's the same reason why the USA still doesn't have comparable public healthcare yet.

Either way I still think it's the best option and it also  seems to counter the problems you bring up so...

edit: forgot to answer the bit about the VB debacle. Hmm I'm not against the constitutional changes that happened there. If they happened to condemn VB is up for speculation but it's definitely not something that could i think be done more to shut down other political parties unless quite extremist.

This is very much BS btw. The Trias politica(separation of powers) is applied quite strictly here in Belgium. If not and arrangements were indeed made then that would've been completely illegal and not relevant to this discussion.

Again, not true, if there isn't the freedom to pursue one's own achievements, you are not in a capitalist society. Slaves and serfs were treated like cattle and not like people in their own rights, these were feudal societies and not capitalist societies.

&gt;Given that ownership rights are central in capitalism, arguably free enterprise is antithetic to it.

Capital can be privately owned, people can't be owned at all.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;True that. Though people ought to look at other societies where capitalism isn't present.

Capitalism is not a one-country affair. Right now, all countries are part of the capitalist world economy. Just a few isolated tribes in the Amazon and Indonesia are not, and their lives are not brutish, nasty and short.

&gt;Yes, the lessons we learned is that the state needs to keep a balanced budget, that it can't run these constant deficits, to get these massive levels of debt and to constantly delay its obligations.

State debt isn't half as damaging to an economy as private debt. Excessive private debt has caused more turmoil then excessive state debt.

&gt; This is hardly a lesson at all

The Roman Empire still had a millenium to go at that point. Carry on, I'd say.

&gt;Why do some people think this is a failure of capitalism when, on the contrary, it's yet again another failure of government. 

You can't take credit for the good and shove off the blame for the bad.

But as I said...there was no problem. If there was then see my previous statement below.

Lets approach it from the same perspective but whilst looking at your way of doing things.

&gt;I think limiting the amount an entity/individual can donate would fix that.

A company or whoever donates more in secret. This is illegal but lets say it happened.

Is your whole system faulty now? No it might work perfectly but there was not enough control by other entities on how it was applied. (My arguments against it aside)

This goes for both the Vlaams Belang argument and mine.

true,TheMemo,null,null,"&gt; A third feared wasting a doctor's time.

This isn't anything to do with a 'stiff upper lip,' but rather the quality of care given by doctors in the NHS these days.

When you go to the doctor, you are treated as a nuisance. Their primary goal is to get you out of there as quickly as possible. If there is something they cannot diagnose, they dissuade you from seeing a specialist.

A friend of mine woke up one day unable to feel one side of her body. She was a nurse and, so, was reasonably certain that this was a severe problem. We took her to ER and they refused to believe her, accusing her of lying and wasting everyone's time. 

She went to her local GP who was similarly useless and seemed to exist purely to provide sick notes to people. He also did not believe her.

Eventually she had to use her contacts within the hospital where she worked (the same hospital, incidentally, where the ER had dismissed her) to force through MRI scans and other tests.

The result? She had suffered a stroke and had a blood clot mixed in with her spinal fluid.

If she had been tested &amp; treated immediately when she arrived at the ER, much could have been done. However, as she was not, she may never fully regain sensation.


Another friend has suffered from crippling back and neck pain for most of her life, but was told by doctors that she was either lying or imagining it because they could not diagnose it.

Last year she finally had enough money to see a private specialist who diagnosed a brain-chemical imbalance and put her on - if I remember correctly - some sort of serotonin(?) pills. She is now free of pain.


My mother is one of those who doesn't like to go to the doctor for fear of ""wasting his time."" And who can blame her? She appears to have age-related macular degeneration but her doctor's attitude is that he won't even diagnose it and that she should just deal with it. He has told her not to bother going to another doctor or specialist about it. He will not refer her anywhere.


As much as I am a fan of the NHS (having witnessed the American system first-hand from both sides, and it is much worse) our Doctors really suck - they are prideful, will not admit when they don't know something and will actively try and stop you seeing a specialist. I'm sure they do see a lot of time-wasters but, their attitude as 'guardians of the health service' has caused irreparable harm to many people I know.",0,1359555091,null,0,false,0,c868sba,t3_17jvns,t1_c868sba,t3_17jvns,null,1431128813,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Not the market but people. Necessities are limitless.

&gt;But the demand is ultimately limited to how many products people can find use for in their limited time. The more automation there is around, the less total amount of person - work hours is needed to satisfy all the demand. So naturally either all people reduce the amount of work they do, or some people remain completely out-of-work.

Und im Tode,

als die letzten wenigen Leichen verrottend auf der schlammigen Durchgangsstraße lagen,

hoben sich die Fensterläden um ein Handbreit am Temperance Gebäude,

hoch auf dem Poacher’s Hügel/Hill.

Und rote, mutierte Augen starrten hinab auf Hunger City.

Keine hohen Tiere mehr.

Flöhe so groß wie Ratten saugten an Ratten so groß wie Katzen,

und zehntausende Peoploids teilten sich in kleine Stämme auf,

die höchsten der sterilen Wolkenkratzer begehrend,

wie Hundemeuten die Glasfronten der Love-Me Avenue erstürmend.

Nerze und glänzende Silberfüchse zerreißend und umpackend, nun Stulpen.

Familienwappen aus Saphir und rissigem Smaragd.

An irgendeinem Tag jetzt, (or: Jederzeit nun,)

das Jahr der Diamond Dogs.

„Das ist kein Rock’n’Roll, das ist Völkermord.“

Right. I tend to have tunnel vision in reddit threads and sometimes just comment on stuff without always checking the parent comments :) so sorry if I misrepresented your views.

The references I gave are not all completely pertaining to East Asian-style capitalism, but basically some of the stuff that I think provides serious challenges to neoliberal dogma in all spheres.

Japan, South Korea and Singapore all differ in the way they implemented a developmental state, but they all violate the neoliberal dogmas so significantly that they completely destroy the ""free market is always best"" argument (which I thought you were championing). Ha-Joon Chang is interesting because he actually dares to say that protectionism and state involvement might have helped some of these countries. This is a huge ""no-no"" in economics, but he gets away with it because so much evidence is quite clearly on his side and is ignored by mainstream economists in the US (but not in Asia or within Asian regional studies, which is my expertise).",0,1359558200,null,0,false,0,c869i81,t3_17i8pa,t1_c869i81,t1_c869bkz,null,1435636187,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
