true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I'm not going to rehash every argument but put quite simply, many EU countries already do not honour their commitments to NATO which means the UK and France take the large bulk of responsibility for the defence of the EU by default.

And they don't honor those commitments because they know the U.K., America and France will pick up the slack. But America is changing direction, and the U.K. and France can't do it themselves. The entirety of Europe's military needs is placed on their shoulders, this is unfair as hell. And besides being unfair, it's unwise in the long-term to concentrate the full military power of the entire E.U. into the hands of only two states. 

Those other E.U. countries SHOULD honor their commitments. They should be burdened with the military responsibility, and the associated military spending, just as much as the U.K. or France. 

&gt;That's without even going into the myriad of administrative and bureaucratic minefields.

All of which can be overcome. The E.U. did it politically, NATO did it militarily. You have two systems staring you in the face that say this is possible, and not only possible, but effective. 

&gt;A unified EU military is a ""nice idea"" of enhanced integration in arguably the most important sphere of national/international duty but the reality is that all of that can be achieved, with potentially better results with none of the risk via defence co-operation such as the deals the UK has with France and full on defensive pacts like NATO.

It's not risk in my mind, it's a step in the right direction. NATO doesn't cater to Europe's interests and needs. Mali and Libya are examples of this, with my country being less and less supportive of those types of operations. Plus a common European military means a more integrated Europe and a more integrated Europe means a stronger Europe and a stronger ally of my country. 

&gt;As for your suggestion of the abolishment of NATO; I have to be clear here and say that I think this is madness - I consider NATO to be the single most critical factor behind both winning the Cold War and preventing internal conflict since the end of WW2 (with nuclear weapons being a close second). It's such a fantastic organisation and any fantasising you may have done about an EU military having any less issues or being any more efficient is just that; a fantasy.

But the Cold War is over. And I'm not calling for the abolishment of the Mutual Defense Pact, I'm only calling for the abolishment of the bureaucracy. As long as NATO in it's present form is around, a European military is not needed, which in my opinion hinders European integration and prevents a strong Europe from taking it's place on the global stage. 

Utilizing the standardization employed by NATO makes a common European military that much easier to form. And in my mind, a EU-US taskforce working together would be a lot more effective than a NATO Taskforce working together. 

&gt;Having been party to some joint training exercises, the idea that that could be all we have in the face of the world's many threats is bloody terrifying.

But can't you see you'd be way more capable of effectively facing those threats with a European military? Especially in cases like Libya and Mali? My country is moving away from it's Europe-based Cold War strategy where NATO was the foremost organization in it's mind. All of that's in the past and the remnants of it have it's days numbered. 

The day will come where there is no U.S. support for those operations. And what then? ",0,1375143137,null,0,false,0,cbcy1d6,t3_1javu0,t1_cbcy1d6,t1_cbcx78t,null,1430119229,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

When you estabilish voting system you need to formulate purpose of it. Different countries have different issues and goals, for example Lebanon is multi-religious, US is big, very diverse and a federation, Nigeria has 2 major religions fighting with each other, Spain has internal issues with autonomus regions, Italy is made of 2 very different macro-regions and so on. System which is good in one country can ruin another and it has to be tailor-made.

In Poland, and you will agree with me, issues are:

* a very large part of society which isn't voting on major parties, about 2x% of active voters, doesn't have representation in both houses, despite lower house having 460 members (which is way too much for our system),

* constitutional 'political responsibility' for (lawful) wrongdoing is non-existent,

* locomotive- candidate phenomena stated above- some people who are members of parilament don't have mandate from society, 

* inability to point out who is responsible for acting for your region (btw this is an issue in all proportional systems),

* lack of fresh blood/ ideas in political scene, which is monopolised by the same people since 24 years,

* lack of pluralism in parties (don't even start with theatre made by PO)- it's more of what leader said, not what person who is representing society or given region thinks (compare this to british or american model, even coalitions in Italy if you are interested in, where in one party there are many ideas and people act to make them real)

The best way to fix these issues are JOW. Of course this system has some issues, but it would work better in Poland. It doesn't have to be pure 'majority system, it can be tweaked in many, many ways. By the way we already have majority system in upper house (since last election), but debate (supported by this jow organisation) about abolishing senate or changing it into representation of local goverments/ intelectuals/ former presidents is a total misunderstanding of the issue. As I stated above, different countries need different 'tools' and there is no doubt that young democracy, which tend to listen to populists promises, with lack of political elites need 'house of consideration', where massive legislation fixes occurs and people are more cultural and sophisticated.

Again, given the information available at the time, the complex financial instruments were extremely safe. They had proven mathematical models that demonstrated they were safe. Real proofs with real mathematics. So, if you want to go down that route, there is no evident difference why one is reckless and the other is prudent investment. 

&gt; I presented two points, the first of which was purely pragmatic and it's a shame you didn't comment on it much.

My paragraph above should cover that. The problem was not the correctness of the models but the simplifying assumptions that were used to describe the economy that were necessary in order to make the model solvable. You want to make a point that financiers should had questioned the underlying assumptions of economics, be my guest, I'd love that. 

&gt; Let's rewind a bit. You prompted me to explain in depth why I think there is a fundamental distinction between banks' investments in Greek bonds and their engagement in new, complex instruments. I presented two points, the first of which was purely pragmatic and it's a shame you didn't comment on it much. The second point was a predominantly moral one, true, but I raised it only because the entire concept of ""recklessness"" is moral in nature.

I prompted you to explain in depth why there is a distinction between the two types of investment because your argument that ""investing in Greek bonds was not reckless"" could be equally applied to these financial instruments. But the whole point of the conversation was whether ""investing in Greek bonds is reckless or not"". And when I said ""reckless"" in the beginning, I meant from your usual capitalist perspective, in that it was a risky investment that had a high probability of not paying off for the individual economic actor making that decisions. So, there's no moral judgement here. I'm merely judging the banks as a selfish economic actor that is trying to maximise its individual profit. And failing in that task. 

To sum up, on one hand you tried to make a case why a priori Greek bonds ""seemed like a good idea at the time"". I presented another investment that had the exact same characteristic and demonstrated why it too a priori was a good investment but nevertheless the people who made that investment are now judged extremely negatively by virtually everyone. On the other hand, you made an argument about private investors having a moral responsibility to help states out by buying their bonds to help the system keep going but I assume you are taking it back since you said ""I don't believe investment decisions should be made based on moral grounds"". 

---

&gt; My point is more subtle. Capitalism evolves around the idea that people acting in their rational self-interest benefits the society as a whole in the long run. Altruism is desirable in individual cases but any system that relies on altruism to work is doomed to failure. At its best, capitalism harnesses people's natural tendency to act on self-interest and makes it benefit society as a whole.

This is a different discussion, as far as I can tell.  

I've never seen a reputable argument why ""acting on self-interest"" is the default modus operandi of the human soul. In fact, I find it quite arrogant that people are going around giving this ""obvious"" answer to a philosophical question about human nature that has been with us since forever. Second, I've seen no conclusive evidence or proof that ""any system that relies on altruism to work is doomed to failure"". Also, your assertion that ""altruism is desirable in individual cases"" is undermined by the fact that capitalism is a system that relies on individualism and is therefore bound to curtail altruistic behaviour in general.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; This map also provides some perspective. Imagine if that was the country of your people that you could only helplessly watch being consumed like that.

That map is **total and complete bullshit**. Let me count the ways:

1. The four maps are not comparing like to like. The latter three maps show sovereign territory (or at least administrative control), while the first map shows private land ownership. So the comparison is faulty, from the get-go.

2. The labels are wrong. In map #1, white is labeled ""Jewish land,"" and green is labeled ""Palestinian land."" While ""Jewish land"" is reasonably okay--""Jewish-owned land"" would be more accurate--""Palestinian land"" is both anachronistic and wrong. Firstly, mostly of the land area in British Palestine was not privately-owned, but owned by the state (Britain). This area is labeled as ""Palestinian land,"" despite the ridiculousness of the idea that the entire Negev desert was privately owned by Arabs. Meanwhile, the map of 1967 is just completely wrong. It shows the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as ""Palestine."" In 1967, the West Bank was an annexed part of the Kingdom of Jordan, and the Gaza Strip was administered by an Egyptian military authority. There was no self-governance for Palestinians in any part of that territory, or any real differentiation from the occupying Arab countries, so how could these territories possibly be listed as ""Palestinian?""

3. The context is missing. In the first map, it looks like the Palestinians owned the vast majority of the land and consequently constituted the overwhelming majority of the population. In fact, Jews made up 30-40% of the population, so it really was not unreasonable to offer them more territory than what was privately owned by Jews. The second map is missing the context that this compromise was rejected absolutely by *every Arab state*. The partition plan was a dead letter from the get-go because the Arabs said they'd never consider it, and now you want us to believe that the ""Arab state"" in the partition plan constitutes a legitimate land claim for Palestinians now? The third map is, again, missing the context that there was no sovereign ""Palestine"" in 1967. Gaza was Egyptian-occupied and the West Bank was fully incorporated into Jordan. The fourth map is missing the context that those small islands of Palestinian autonomy are the first example *in history* of Palestinian self-governance, and that was achieved by negotiations with Israel. Really, the Palestinians were *given* what autonomy they have by Israel.

There are claims to be made about Israel encroaching on ""Palestinian land,"" but these maps are flat-out *lies*. Please don't use them again.",0,1375148614,null,0,false,0,cbczzbl,t3_1j9ntt,t1_cbczzbl,t1_cbcstbh,null,1430064702,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; It's never bothered them before and I see no way of changing that without literally pulling back on our own defence considerably and forcing them to pick up the slack, neither the UK or France is going to do that and for good reason.

It hasn't bothered them before because they had the U.S. to back them up in almost every instance. With the pivot to the Pacific and the U.S.'s changing geo-political strategy, this is factor to change. 

Both the U.K. and France lack the level of power projection they had twenty years ago, and to top it off, now the U.S. is leaving the picture so they can't even rely on that either. Hell, even in the face of this, the British are making huge military spending cuts and the French were only *just* capable of carrying out Mali independently, despite it only being a case of regional power projection. 

&gt;That may be true but their actions clearly indicate that they're happy with that, they get to spend that money elsewhere whilst still being protected - something they don't have to admit because we don't have an imminent threat on our doorstep.

You have two completely unstable regions bordering you, a hornets nest of ethnic tension in the Balkans and a ever-present Russia who thinks some of the E.U.'s newer Eastern European members still belong in their sphere of influence. Not to mention those two unstable regions I mentioned before, well, France gets more it's uranium from Northern Africa *(nuclear power powering most their country)* and Europe still depends on most it's oil to come from the Middle East. It's a issue of energy security as well. 

And I wouldn't say France is completely happy with the status quo given [this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10205537/France-and-Germany-call-for-closer-EU-military-cooperation.html).

&gt; don't agree at all, France received the external support it required in Mali and you're ignoring the fact that it was a very French problem. Would they have preferred that the entire of NATO descended on the country? Maybe - but you could make that argument for anything.
Libya was fine, you seem to be equating NATO caring about the EU's interests with the US taking the lead and being primary on everything, I don't see it that way.

It received that support only after the United States' refused a good couple times and they had to beg. I recall the French President being shocked that the United States actually charged them for using it's planes. 

They did it to make a point. The point I've been trying to get across. America isn't going to be there for these type of operations, and Obama and the recent Secretaries of Defense have made this EXPLICITLY CLEAR, repeatedly asking Europe to get it's house in order and to keep watch over their own neighborhood. 

And Libya wasn't fine. If you recall, America DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THE LEAD, it was supposed to merely act in support to the mainly French-British *(but also Italian)* operation. It was supposed to be independent of my country. YET, this proved impossible and America was forced to supply not only the majority of logistical and intelligence needs, but also take over command and control. 

At present, Pan-European taskforces and operations have been proven ineffective, and at worse, disastrous without United States support. 

&gt;That may be in your interests but it's not necessarily in ours, we're nowhere near federalisation and we'd lose countries if we ever got there. It's not the logical conclusion or guaranteed eventuality you think it is; we care a lot more about individual national sovereignty than the outside world may believe.

And you're nowhere closer if you refuse a step like this. You'd only be taking a step back. We are marching into a new multi-polar world, not one that's dominated by a American Hegemony, in which America is the only super power. 

It's not only in our interests, it's in yours as well. A divided Europe is a manipulated Europe. Russia, China, and even my country, if Europe doesn't get it's shit together it'll only be that much easier for it's smaller nations to be taken advantage of my the bigger countries. If to stop this you lose a few members, than so be it. 

&gt;That's a good thing not a bad thing.

Maybe in your opinion, but not mine. It's let directly to Europe mooching off not only my country, but France and the United Kingdom. And from the looks of it, it's nowhere near sustainable, especially with my country's pivot towards the pacific. 

&gt;First of all the EU is on the world stage in a big way, it just takes a different approach to it than the US, besides, I don't think we're capable of it and even if we were I don't think we want it, an EU military doesn't negate either of those things in the slightest.

The reason the E.U. is how it is on the world stage isn't because of choice, it's out necessity. It completely lacks in hard power, and soft power only goes so far. You need a combination to be actually effective and influential in today's world. Like I said before, Europe can keep the status quo, but a divided, less unified Europe means that it's individual member states are that much more open to manipulation and being taken advantage of by not only my country, but of China and Russia as well. 

If that's what Europeans want, than so be it. But don't cry in twenty years when your asking why the U.S. is so influential in your country and why your local governments constantly gets bullied by Russia and China *(effectively)*. 

&gt;Based on what? You're conflating an EU military with a federal EU, individual member states will still have authority over raising its own troops, it will still require consensus between 28 different countries to decide on foreign policy even if you got everything you wanted. NATO is a freeing institution, not a constraining one.

A E.U. Military doesn't need a Federal E.U., although I admit, it'd be must effective if it did. And while you're right, on the surface, NATO isn't a constraining organization. 

But under the surface, it is. It allows the smaller states to underspend and neglect their obligations. It's the sole reason why Europe is so reliant on my country and probably why my country has so much influence over yours. And it's why France and the United Kingdom are stuck doing everybody's elses job, and as Mali and Libya show, their only able to do it just barely. 

Can you at least admit that while you wouldn't agree with a unified European military, that *at least* the other E.U. members should have some sort of proportional military spending...if not all of them...some of them...to take some of the burden and responsibilities off the U.K. and France's shoulders? 

&gt;That's something we all have to deal with, the West is in decline, I think you're underestimating the EU and more importantly underestimating our ability to co-operate whilst remaining independently minded - it's gotten us this far at least.

And with a integrated, unified military you'd be THAT MUCH MORE INDEPENDENT and free form my own country's influence. And I don't think the West is in decline, but I think we are in *danger of it*. A unified European military that's actually capable of regional power projection and coordination, in addition to the US-EU Free Trade Deal, could possibly reverse that. 

You admit yourself that the West is in decline, but don't you realize that the looser the Confederation is, the more dependent the E.U. as a whole is on only TWO countries for it's entire defense, the weaker you'll be in the long run? I'm not advocating complete federalization and integration, but I am advocating a compromise in between. 

As I said before, it's a issue of soft power and hard power. You need both if Europe is too prosper in the coming century .",0,1375148667,null,0,false,0,cbd0008,t3_1javu0,t1_cbd0008,t1_cbcz48a,null,1430064693,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Even so, Scandinavians seem to have simply referred to the united counties as Holland.

I do not know why Scandinavians referred to the country as Holland though, but I assume  Holland was simply the most dominant/wealthy/powerful county in the entire country.

true,WY_in_France,YSavoie,Savoie,"Well, since I've left the US the big banks have taken over and pretty much shut down all of the smaller state-level banks, so I'm not sure if it's still any better over there.

Anyhow, I work in IT for the finance industry, primarily in Switzerland, so I've got a few inside tracks on the banking thing.

First, Seraphinou made a comment about the ""big bad greedy American banks"". I like that statement, mostly because it's totally correct, but also because it forces me to clarify. I am talking about *consumer-level* banking services, not the big investment banks or the investment branches of banks like BNP or Credit Agricole... 

Before I answer your question directly, one more observation: The efficiency and effectiveness (or total lack thereof) of the banks in any given country stems directly from their country's regulatory structures. From that standpoint the banks at the consumer level in France (and the EU in general) are pretty much fucked from the start, since they are basically founded on an administrative nightmare. Interestingly, the positive side effect of that is that it makes France's investment bankers a whole lot less dangerous and therefore slightly less evil.

Generally speaking, I have yet to find many worthwhile or compelling services provided by any bank in France that I couldn't get from an online bank. The only good reason to have an account is because we are basically forced to in order to operate in the society, but there's no real benefit for the end consumer. 

So, some differences between French and American consumer banking:

* If I want to open an account in the US: I walk into any branch *without* an appointment, show any one of the tellers a photo ID (driver's license), sign the signature card, and leave. Total time: 5 minutes.
* I can use my money without having to carefully navigate a maze of fees and rules. In France it takes at best a three-fold, double sided booklet of fine print to detail all the different ways they are going to fleece me for using my money.
* Consumer protection. Suppose I make an online purchase and the merchant screws me around. I don't care. I call my bank and they *reverse the charges*, credit my account, and debit the merchant's account.
* American banks actually deal with money. If I want $3000 in cash I go to the bank and ask for it. No giving one-week of notice, no fucking around, I just walk in and ask for it.
* Ditto for cash and change. If you want to break a $100 bill into quarters or dimes, you walk into any bank and ask. You don't even need an account with them.
* Same story to cash a check. Just walk in, endorse the check, and presto: cash. Suppose someone in France writes you a check and you don't have a bank account somewhere in France to deposit it. What do you do with it? PQ?

I could go on and on... It's like walking into a used car dealership most of the time.

Anyhow, I have met a good many talented and professional French bankers, but they are all working in Switzerland. :)",0,1375163237,null,0,1375163529,0,cbd4wsj,t3_1j9prw,t1_cbd4wsj,t1_cbcp33y,null,1430043995,7,false,france,t5_2qhjz,7

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think, nor do I support, Europe getting involved in this whole *""pivot to asian &amp; the pacific""* strategy my country is pursuing. It is not Europe's issue and I don't think we want to force an ally into a position like that. One of the main reasons for the pivot and our issues with China is the territorial claims China is putting out *(the widespread nationalist support for these claims by it's citizens doesn't really help much either)*, which infringes on the territory of not only Japan, but of South Korea and the Phillipines as well *(all major U.S. allies)*.

We have mutual defense pacts with both Japan and South Korea *(we might have one with the Philippines as well)*, we're required to defend them. China keeps provoking them and poking them with a stick, so we have to prepared to fullfill our commitments, for better or for worse. We can't just abandon them. Half the time I think they do it to gauge our reaction and see if we're really willing to defend them, and I think the pivot makes it pretty clear we are for the foreseeable future. I mean hell, for example, Vietnam is one of the most Pro-U.S. countries in the world right now. **Vietnam**. Specifically because of China's territorial claims which infringe on their border *(well...that and Vietnam has always been the smart one and played the big people off against each other to preserve their independence)*.

Europe on the other hand, IS NOT in this position. They don't have the same responsibilities as us, nor should they be forced too. 

&gt;I'm guessing the USA has all confidence in it being able to do both tasks on the same time, while never letting go of the control it has achieved over Europe, all it needs for this is even more military (is this the direction they're heading at the moment?)

This actually isn't the case. Quite frankly, it's the exact opposite. We're moving 60% of both our Navy and Airforce into the Pacific region. We can't afford to support and play safety for European operations like Mali, Libya or Kosovo/The Balkans. 

Our President and past couple Secretaries of Defense &amp; State have been calling on Europe to get it's house together and to patrol it's own neighborhood. We're moving away from the days where America could always play world police and was the world's only super power, and we're moving into a period which is best summarized as a Multi-Polar world. 

I mean, Europe will always be our ally *(hopefully)*, but we can't afford to keep leading these small European operations, when they should be just that, *European* operations. Libya, Mali, my country has had to provide extensive logistical, intelligence, command and combat support when the European Union should be fully capable of doing it themselves. Yes, I mean, surely we'll always back Europe in a fight, but at the same time we need to maintain global power projection and deter BOTH China and Russia. The President and U.S. government however, would like to see Europe pick up the slack and at least a accomplish a regional-level of power projection, and just enough to deter Russia so the American military isn't stuck doing all of Europe's security needs.  

With a common European military, in my opinion, not only would that be solved and allow Europe to assert more of it's own influence while freeing it from my country's own influence, but it also frees up the global responsibility on America so they can focus more on this newly-announced pivot, and yes, containment of China. 

This, in my opinion, would also lead to a much stronger *""Western Bloc""*. A common European Union military, along with the US-EU FTA is  critical in preserving Western influence, standards and power in the coming *""Asian Century""*. Otherwise, if that doesn't happen, I can easily see Europe dividing itself even further, at which point the smaller European states would be at much more risk of being taking advantage of and manipulated by not only my country, but Russia and China as well. And while this may increase my country's influence in the short-term, a weaker Europe means it's going to be much worse for my own country's prospects in the long-term.

I read a novel once that had this as a plot element (""The Collini case"", ""Der Fall Collini"", recommended btw). The way it's described there, there are cases under which retaliatory executions of civilians were allowed under international law of the time: You could not treat the people to be executed cruelly, you had to inform the civilian population afterwards (in order to have the desired effect) and you could not kill excessively many civilians. Yes, I know a novel is not the best source, but given the quality and the person of the author (Ferdinand von Schirach), I would assume it to be actually well researched. Don't have the time to fact-check now, so please call me out if wrong.

It is, of course, clear that under modern conventions such executions are seen as absolutely not allowed and that modern moral conventions see participation in such executions as war crimes. Clearly, and witnessed by rulings on these cases, many of the mass executions done by the nazis violate some, if not all of the conditions outlined above, and people *have* been sentenced for them. Only not enough, and many too mildly. 
It is also clear that Priebke *was* sentenced for his crimes, the scandal being his mild treatment and the fact that he actually has some following in Italy (tagesschau reports that his last big birthday party was some sort of semi-official function headed by the last major of the town in question).",0,1375167720,null,0,false,0,cbd5zfk,t3_1ja41z,t1_cbd5zfk,t1_cbcsmjm,null,1430043494,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

wiki copypasta: 
On December 25, 1990, Michael I, accompanied by several members of the royal family, landed at Otopeni airport and entered the country using a Danish diplomatic passport, obtaining a 24-hour visa. He intended to reach Curtea de Argeș Cathedral, pray at the tombs of his royal ancestors and attend the Christmas religious service. However, on their way to Curtea de Argeș, the King and his companions were stopped by a police filter, taken to the airport and forced to leave the country.[70]

In 1992, three years after the revolution which overthrew the Communist dictatorship, the Romanian government allowed Michael to return to his country for Easter celebrations, where he drew large crowds. In Bucharest over a million people turned out to see him.[71] Michael's popularity alarmed the government of President Ion Iliescu, so Michael was forbidden to visit Romania again for five years.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"I remember when I was in exchange few years back at Scotland. At the beginning, I spent a lot of time with Swedish exchange students because common cultural values etc. 

When we were going to the Student Union to have lunch for the very first time, we started talking about the pricing practices. For example, at Finland the university food is heavily subsided (whole healthy meal, as much as you can eat with milk/juice and bread for €2,35), and apparently the situation was similar in Sweden. 

Not so in Scotland. Wanted (a very small amount of) chips on your plate? That's £1, please. (Small) sausage next to the potatoes? £1,50, please. Portion of veggies? Another pound. Piece of bread?  £.50. Glass of milk or can of coke? £1. And so on. This is a line (with three or four people on the other side of the table portioning the right number of chips per plate etc.), and as the nature of the system fully clears to us only after we felt we had commited, we felt that we have to go through with this. 

Finally we get to the till and every one of us has more than four pounds worth of consumables on the tray, some almost worth six because the portions were very small and the sausages were very expensice (and the plate is still almost empty). The Swedish guy in front of me takes a small bag of ketchup (similar to the ones they give in McDonalds for takeaway) from next to the cash register. The person manning the register tells this is 50p per bag (a final insult for the long line of exchange students!). 

Behind us, another exchange student (probably Spanish) hears all this and shouts very loudly how this is outrageous, highway robbery etc. The cashier stays silent, extending her hand for the extra 50p due to the Swede having the ketchup in his hand. The Swede shrugs, pays the 50p and says ""Yes, but I like it"". 

Once we're on the table, the Swedish guy confides that he agreed with the Spanish guy but couldn't make himself to create a scene or lose face by complaining or by dropping the ketchup back to the wicker tray on which it lay. The only thing he could do was agree, which he felt was incredibly stupid and sheepish, but he couldn't find any other way out of the situation.

And that was my first insight to the Swedish nature.

BONUS FACT; Next to the student union there were several private food enterprises. My favourite was the grill which had a meal of very large hamburger, big plate of chips and a can of soda (there was a very wide selection) for £2 as a whole. The student union was usually empty during lunch time.

At that time, one pound was about one and half euros.",0,1375170421,null,0,1375170672,0,cbd6icl,t3_1j7vuj,t1_cbd6icl,t1_cbc4j6o,null,1430043249,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,drakeisatool,DENK,Denmark,"Our shameful moments are pretty subjective. We've lost plenty of large battles in the past, but we don't look back to them as shameful per se.

Denmark lost an important battle against Germany in 1864, and from then on there has been a belief in Denmark that we can't really defend ourselves. We're not ashamed over it though.

Then there was the occupation in 1940. The Danish army was overrun in a matter of hours. Six Danish soldiers were killed and our airfelds were bombed by the Luftwaffe. No losses on the German side. Still, we don't look back at it with much shame.

During the occupation, the Danish government figured it faced the choice between cooperation and dissolution. It chose cooperation, and it's still being debated whether the Danish government (and Danish factories) were more cooperative than strictly necessary. They probably were - and some profiteering must have gone on too. So, slightly shameful there, but at least we helped a lot of Jews with escaping to Sweden, so there is that.

In more recent years there have been several cases with fugitives and stateless immigrants being denied a right to stay in Denmark despite the law clearly saying that they did have that right. We've had an entire government step down because of one of these cases, and the last government dismissed its minister of integration in a case with some similar overtones. I'm sure many Danes feel those cases are pretty shameful, and on a whole immigration policy is a sore point for the country.

Then there are the wars. In the war in Iraq and Afghanistan it's like we've been copying Britain, especially with the politics and justification for the wars. It hasn't been pretty. We also bombed the hell out of Libya, but people haven't said much about it.

If you were to ask my opinion, I would say yes, there is some passive hate going on in this thread. Maybe not hate, but irrational distrust and animosity.

What was meant to be a good natured show of solidarity between Israelis and Europeans became very far from that. Really any other similar gesture between other cultures on this sub usually just continue into what it was meant to.

Israel is not perfect, but the willingness to hold against Israel anything that can be held against them is very reminiscent of antisemitism as I've seen it.

The modern academic way of examining cultures is to look at it through it's own context and not judge or compare it through another culture's values. There is some willingness to hold Israel as an exception and judgments it through European values instead of it's own.

Il concetto di fondo è che spesso il volontariato è espressione di una società che non funziona. In una società che funziona il volontariato sarebbe molto ""poco"" e non per mancanza di altruismo ma perché non necessario, perché tutti quanti (con le tasse per essere terra terra) contribuirebbero a far si che persone competenti facciano il *volontariato della società*.

Dato che questo tipo di società è utopica (anche se le varie democrazie del nord europa ci si avvicinano tantissimo) le persone altruiste si organizzano per fare del volontariato.

Questo però, se stiamo appunto parlando di società che sono ben lungi dall'essere utopiche, legittima le mancanze della Società che quindi, nel tempo, riterrà *normale* non doversi occupare di chi sta messo peggio perchè *""tanto ci pensano i servizi di volontariato""*.

Questo parlandone ad un livello ampio.

Ad un livello personale, purtroppo ho avuto modo di essere parte di associazioni di volontariato sia di piccoli paesi (dove sono nato e cresciuto) che di grandi città (dove vivo adesso) e purtroppo ovunque vedo che ci sono molte, molte persone che sono in un associazione di volontariato solo per altri interessi o vantaggi. Da qui la mia disillusione su chi fa volontariato.

Che alla fine si ottenga comunque il risultato dell'avere del volontariato a mio avviso non giustifica la bassezza delle ragioni che muovono molte persone che fanno volontariato.

Il problema non è poi soltanto questo. E' che quelle persone che sono nell'associazione per tutt'altro motivo, in realtà poi fanno *""male""* il loro volontariato e partecipano, nella *meno peggiore* delle prospettive, a peggiorare la fama di un'associazione oppure nella peggiore delle prospettive, a offrire un servizio di volontariato pessimo, rischiando di essere dannosi per chi ha bisogno.",0,1375174284,null,0,false,0,cbd767t,t3_1j9oh7,t1_cbd767t,t1_cbd6k4x,null,1430042940,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

&gt;**SPIEGEL:** Why shouldn't the EU be able to be a champion of soft power?

&gt;**Laqueur:** Freedom, human rights, social justice are all wonderful, and I don't want to minimize the achievements of European societies. But a role model? Europe is much too weak to play a civilizing or moral role in world politics. Nice speeches and well-intentioned admonitions carry little weight when made from a position of weakness. In fact, all they do is aggravate China and Russia. Such reproofs are presumptuous, insincere and, unfortunately, often ridiculous. Under the current circumstances, Europe would be well advised to keep a lower profile.

That's from a acclaimed 92-year old European historian and political commentator. He's probably has more experience than both of our lifetimes combined. So like I said, this isn't a American perspective, and it's both ignorant and presumptuous to assume such.

The document was written by George Morgan, who was the director of the [Psychological Strategy Board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Strategy_Board), which was created in response to the growth of the Office of Policy Coordination covert activities during the Korean War.

The [Office of Policy Coordination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Policy_Coordination) was a US covert psychological operations and paramilitary action organization, merged with the CIA in 1951. George Kennan (father of the ""*containment* theory) was a key figure behind the OPC's creation, and its executive officer was Frank Wisner, a former OSS figure.

Here's an exerpt of this document, page 36, chapter VIII Part A *""France and the European Integration""* :

*""The idea [of European integration] would not have survived without U.S. support[...]It was necessary to obtain from the partners of the Schuman Plan countries in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the permission to remove tarrifs among the six participants.
All these steps involved complex negotiations in which the U.S. had to play a part in order to maintain the original momentum of the idea, and in order to prevent deviations.
Recognition of the Community by the U.S. led to its acceptance by the Europeans. Sometimes the action of the United States can be most effective when it supports discreetly and firmly specific policies proposed by the people directly interested.""*

*""The Schuman Plan was the first step toward economic union, itself a step toward political union(...)The Community will either be paralyzed by [political issues] or will have to take the leadership toward radical changes in the structure of European sovereignties.
An attempt is being made now in the latter direction. Subcommittees of the Schuman Plan Assembly have prepared a draft of a European constitution.
This appears to be the most effective step already taken for solving political issues inherent in the Schuman Plan, for acheiveing the military goals of Europe and for overcoming France's and West Germany's hesitation to ratify the European Army Treaty"".*
 
*""In Europe and overseas, the main problem for France is to renounce an extreme nationalistic and protectionist attitude. Since the National State on the French scale, jealous to preserve all the features of its sovereignty, cannot cope with the modern world,  one solution is to integrate France into a supra-national organization of Europe(...)
The strength of national feelings cannot be reduced by force, or made to disappear by formal arrangements. It can be dealt with only by the mellowing of the feeling itself under the influence of deep and long-term economic and cultural trends.""*

true,Latvis,LATV,Latvia,"Some ancient history, in 1236 a combined force of pagan Žemaiši/Samogitians (Lithuanians) and Zemgaļi/Semigallians (Latvians) destroyed a 3000-strong force of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword(German crusaders, basically). Thirty years worth of their conquests on the south bank of the Daugava river were lost(ha, take that!) and the battle inspired rebellions among other pagan tribes. Although, Latvia and Lithuania didn't exist as states at that time, but nevertheless, it's a little point of pride for many people. Especially since the Germans took the upper hand later, anyway.

I'd say that for Latvians, November of 1919 is a proud time - our soldiers kicked Bermondt (a German-Russian military ""adventurer) and his forces out of Riga, and for the next two years fought off the Reds to establish an independent Latvia. Estonia and Lithuania helped, so thanks, guys, for that!

The Baltic Way, when something like ~~200,000~~ **2 million** people joined hands all across the Baltics in a show of solidarity and demanding freedom from the USSR. August 23rd, 1989.

The time of the barricades, in January of 1991, is also a pretty proud moment for us. After seeing what happened in Vilnius, where Russian OMON special forces attacked and shot up a whole bunch of people, 500,000 people gathered in Riga to show support for our *braliukas* and then get to work to make sure that it wouldn't turn out like that in Latvia.  Tractors, logs, all sorts of building materials were used to block access to strategic locations of our renewed state.

OMON still attacked, though, and killed 8 people. But the barricades and the opposition made their position unsustainable, so they fell back. And here we are, 22 years later, with the only extremists being some right-wingers and a few Russians who want Latgale to secede from Latvia.

Finally, in more general terms, we've done quite well for ourselves after independence. Haven't gone down to the dark side, as the Central Asian states did, and we're not as corrupt as, using a relevant example, Bulgaria is. And the ethnic relations here aren't terrible, even though they're not great. Not ethnic street battles or anything like that. :) ",0,1375176837,null,0,1375179416,0,cbd7jwd,t3_1jc5me,t1_cbd7jwd,t3_1jc5me,null,1430042762,32,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,32

http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ITA0044/_PO.HTM

Giusto per completezza, proprio qualche giorno fa ho letto un saggio secondo cui, almeno nel Medioevo e molto probabilmente anche prima, il leone era simbolo di un regnante, e l'asino di un potenziale usurpatore, o comunque di un plebeo/servo della gleba, ecc.

L'autore sostiene che, oltre ad essere simboli generici di regalità e stupidità, le storie in realtà tramandavano fatti realmente accaduti, ""animalizzandone"" i protagonisti per passare la censura.

Quindi leone ed asino, non come simboli di concetti astratti, ma come allegorie di persone ben precise, e le storie non come pura invenzione, ma come narrazione di un evento reale.

Citava ad esempio proprio una storia mesopotamica che aveva come protagonisti un asino ed un leone, giunta peraltro in Italia tramite un testo ebraico del secolo XI.

True but that would defeat the goal of weakening Hungary.

The Israelis assume all of the land actually belongs to them, when it does not (according to international consensus). So they treat the Palestinians on that land as though they are a ""problem"" that needs to be constrained. Some extremists may go so far as to say ""eliminated"".

A simple example: The water supply to Palestinian cities is only switched on by the Israelis twice per week. The Palestinians have big water tanks above their buildings which they desperately fill using pumps whenever the water comes back on.

This does not create an environment of stability and happiness. It does not create the conditions of peace. And it's directly the fault of the Israelis.

If the borders are reinstated, and everyone keeps to their side of the border, the Israelis only lose land they alone think they're entitled to. And the Palestinians gain the ability to grow and prosper in their own right. Both would gain from peace.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"Hands downs the [Portuguese succession crisis of 1580](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_succession_crisis_of_1580). It was downhill ever since.

To sum it up a bit: A young, inbred, sexually molested as a child by a priest, and overall extremely pious king, decides to invade Alcácer-Quibir, in what is modern day Morocco, to further Catholic Faith. That stunt created a succession void that allowed Spain to legally unite with Portugal and with it squander nearly all of Portugal's conquests. 

Fuck everything about our rulers and our noblemen. Throughout history, we had but a small hand full of good leaders and the rest were fucking retards being puppeteered by foreign interests. It still is today. They just don't match the many qualities and cohesion our people have.

The pre and post revolution period of 74 was also disastrous. Disastrous for the people overseas, who were left without any support and many were slaughtered. Also, for the peoples of East Timor it spelled Indonesian annexation and a 30 year violent and bloody occupation. Cape Verde and St. Tomé &amp; Principe perhaps should have been kept.

The political mess that followed April's revolution led our country to being robbed from it's major riches and assets, accumulated over decades of frugality and lack of social investment. An entire political culture arose from that 74 brew that had neither quality nor the interest of the people at heart. Also led to successive IMF interventions. Guess what, we're still  at it.

The politicians responsible are still around, and all of them are rich beyond reasonable. 

But still, I hold [Marcelo Caetano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Caetano) accountable, for not allowing a peaceful transition to democracy and decolonization, failing to seize the self-presented opportunity following [Salazar's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_de_Oliveira_Salazar) death.

Some dark moments in Portugal's History are: 

The [1755 Earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1755_Lisbon_earthquake), as a serious blow to the people and the [Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire) and removed Lisbon from it's European relevance; 

The [Royal family escape to Brazil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_the_Portuguese_Court_to_Brazil), during the [Peninsular Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_War) and [Napoleonic Invasions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars). When we returned the favor and took Madrid, perhaps we should have razed it.

Spain's backstabbing has been a constant and is greatly imbued in popular culture. We like the Spanish people very much, we just don't trust their leaders intentions. I don't think we trust ours as well...

aware that their demands contradicted the 
ethnic principle; they relied on the Entente's 
wish to weaken Hungary. President Thomas 
G. Masaryk already warned against the creation of a sizable Hungarian minority within 
the Czecho-Slovak borders.6
He would have 
preferred a border reflecting ethnic realities, 
one that would have left a smaller number of 
Hungarians on the Czechoslovak side. In

the new state

This is a very selective reading of Hungarian history (which is understandable, as Romanian historiography tends to emphasize the moments of Hungarian strength). 

From the early 16th to the late 18th they did not run or co-run anything and were dominated culturally by Turks (quite directly in what is now Hungary) and Austrians.

So I admire a lot of people and a lot of groups for a lot of different reasons. Some of them include people living in the same countries as I and my predecessors. Most, however, probably live far away. 

I can't really answer a question like that in any real measure since I don't agree with the premise that I have the right to be proud of anyone but myself or someone who's good virtues or actions are a consequence of my involvement.

Having said that. My country didn't really exist until 22 years ago and in light of all the recent revelations and the neo-liberal connections of our ""liberators"" I can hardly say I admire them. 

I do admire my grandfather for having fought, against all odds, the nazis because he believed in his cause even after being shot.

I admire many people that did the same. Many people in our country(or any other), however, did not. I can understand their hesitation in the time of crisis but their decision was still the wrong one and they were still a part of the same group.

* Erasmus' The Praise of Folly is seen as catalyst to the Protestant Reformation. In this book, he criticised the corrupt decadent church through satire.

* In 1581 we fired our king, paving the way for the end of ""divine rule"". 

* We allowed Jews to practice openly in the early 17th century.

* Rationalism, the precursor to the Enlightenment can be traced back to the De La Court brothers and Baruch Spinoza. The Courts were radical supporters of democracy, opposing Hobbes' and others pro-authoritarian writings. Spinoza was a Sephardic Jew who was kicked out of the Amsterdam Jewish community because he was so progressive.

* After the Franco-Anglo-German invasion of 1672, Willem III made it his life's work to oppose Louis XIV. He conquered England in 1688 and used it as a tool against the Sun King. The alliances he forged eventually helped prevent France from uniting with Spain at the start of the 18th century.

* We supported the colonial rebels in the New World several years before they started their Independence War. This war finally broke the power of the Republic, but weakened the British Empire too.

* The progressive faction joined in on the French Revolution in 1795, leading to a more democratic government and religious freedom.

* Napoleon was finally defeated in the Netherlands in 1815, and with that starts the ""Dark Age"" of monarchic rule (to misuse the term). It mostly involves misrule, alienation of the southern Netherlands, and the exploitation and devastation of Indonesia. Oh yeah, we also imprisoned/castrated gays between 1945 and **1971**.

* Over 150 years later, we start coming out of the ""Dark Age"". In the 1970s, the tolerance of soft drug use starts.

* In 1994 we have our first government (since universal suffrage) without the Christian-Democrats. This government legalises prostitution and limited euthanasia (still quite rare in the world), and is the first in the world to allow country-wide same-sex marriage (2001).

* Despite some minor improvements (trans rights), we're currently regressing back into retardation. :/",0,1375178472,null,0,false,0,cbd7rzt,t3_1jc5me,t1_cbd7rzt,t3_1jc5me,null,1430042657,29,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,29

true,[deleted],null,null,"You're unfamiliar with history. A little something called the Cold War happened, and this caused my country to commit to Europe's defense for close to half-a-century. This has basically blanketed Europe in a American security blanket for the past few decades, a security blanket also held up by France and the United Kingdom. 

This has led to chronic underspending by E.U. countries when it comes to the military, specifically because of that ""one thing called NATO"" which ensured they would be protected by the largest military power in the world. Because of this, only 5 out 28 members *(the U.K., France, Greece, Albania, and the U.S.)* of NATO actually meet the 2% of their GDP requirement for military funding.

Yeah, sure, Portugal participated in Afghanistan and Kosovo. But who supplied them? Who provided intelligence to them? Who contributed the most forces? Who put them on the ground? Who commanded the overall operation? Libya is testament to this.  If you recall, America DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THE LEAD, it was supposed to merely act in support to the mainly French-British (but also Italian) operation. It was supposed to be independent of my country. YET, this proved impossible and America was forced to supply not only the majority of logistical and intelligence needs, but also take over command and control.

Mali was supposed to be a completely French operation. But it wasn't. Turns out the French needed help there as well. It received that support only after the United States' refused a good couple times and they had to beg. I recall the French President being shocked that the United States actually charged them for using it's planes. 

My country charged them to make a point. The point I've been trying to get across. America isn't going to be there for these type of operations, and Obama and the recent Secretaries of Defense have made this EXPLICITLY CLEAR, repeatedly asking Europe to get it's house in order and to keep watch over their own neighborhood.

You see, we're shifting away from that Cold War-era strategy I mentioned before. Europe is no longer the focal point of America's global strategy, hence the *""Pivot to the Pacific""* that my country is undertaking.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Gender equality is the goal

It's an ideological goal, based in wishful thinking, not reality. Like all the other kinds of equality. However it is not even diametrically opposed to traditional masculinity. It is somewhat opposed, but not a 100% head on collision. For example you would have a more masculine society by allowing dueling, even though it would not affect women.

&gt; Your personal concept of masculinity has nothing to do with the biology of XY chromosomes.

Not personal, but historical and prehistorical. Don't assume I am just projecting preferences into it, it insulting my sincerity. I am putting efforts into _learning_ it and it is hard and bitter because I am by nature a very ""beta"" bookworm. It's not my preference at all, it is the reality I am learning about.

&gt; If that were the case tradition would change on its own, but it doesn't. 

Of course it does! It changes all the time.

&gt;Your idea of what masculinity is is not rooted in fact AT ALL.

You can keep repeating it, but you have not made any effort to prove that. Remember: my idea is simply the common subset of 1) history 2) prehistory 3) animal behavior. This is a HUGE material and you can't just go on ignoring it.

&gt;There have been many societies in the past where feminity among men wasn't considered unnatural or something similar.

There was not an agricultural or historical society where dominant behaviors were not expected of men. Be that self dominance (self control, courage), object dominance (e.g. technological skill), dominating other men (e.g. social classes, military) or dominating women (patriarchy). 

&gt;Many animals exhibit homosexuality, are you going to claim that's unnatural? Because I am quite sure you'd call homosexuality a plot of leftists to 'suppress masculinity'.

Homosexuality is a modern social construct in this form. Look a bit around in history and generally you find an entirely different pattern: top and bottom parts of it are entirely separated. An Ancient Greek finds nothing wrong with being a top, but finds it wrong that a freeborn mature man be a bottom, because the top is dominant and the bottom is submissive, he delegates the bottom role to youth or slaves. Similarly, homosexual acts amongst animals are the expression of dominance, it is always the dominant male who penetrates, often it is an act to get a submissive male back into line. 

This narrative is exactly the same in Ancient Greece, Rome, modern Russian prisons, medieval Islamic kingdoms, Afghanistan etc., and many kinds of animals, mostly focusing on mammals of course: it is OK for a masculine man to penetrate, both women and men, but it is degrading for a man to take the penetrated, submissive position.

The leftist plot is the part that the dominating and the submissive aspects of sexuality can be washed together into one label ""homosexuality"" and basically accepted together. 

Of course it is not so. It is not ""gays"" natural masculintiy abhors, it is specifically _voluntary bottoms, voluntary male submissives_.

&gt; You aren't aware of this, but the whole concept of sin in sexuality is based in medieval christianity, not in nature.

Thanks for assuming I am ignorant. Anyone who is not a leftie must be an unread brute right? It is actually much more complicated than you think. It all goes back to Paul's attempts to put a stop to the Romano-Greek rape industry. Then Aristotelean natural law theory focused on reproduction in the Middle Ages, with the assumption that that follows nature, and so on, it is complex. One thing is sure, the evolutionary purpose of sex is obviously reproduction, that cannot really be denied. What else it gets used for is a different matter. This not the problem.

The problem is that modernity somehow manages to separate sexual intercourse from the broader range of sexual - gender expression. Putting it simply, modern people don't get that for example war or to say something more humane: competitive sports, and sexual intercourse are rooted in the same thing. We tend to overvalue and glorify intercourse while forgetting other aspects of living our gender. Medievals could afford to repress intercourse more, because when a man felt manly i.e. dominant he did not necessarily have to seduce some gal into bed, he could go to war and express it on the battlefield. Then again, it is not necessarily a good thing. It's complex. Most things are, just moderns, leftists like to oversimplify everything into opression = baaaaad simplistic thinking.

We had, but we were out of Africa before the Scramble. Slave trade was banned pretty early in Denmark, so we had no use for the colony in Africa in the entire 19th century.

It was the colonies in the Caribbean that sucked, because slavery didn't end, just because the trade did. Of course ending the slave trade was of a way to outphase it. But there were slaves working on sugarcane plantations on Skt. Thomas, Skt. Jan and Skt. Croix until 1848.

I've been looking for how we did it for years, but nothing really pops up, like it does with Iceland.

true,calw,UKGB,United Kingdom,"All of these places do well because they are still able to negotiate trade deals with the EU, there is no guarantee that the UK will be able to do the same. Also the argument that some places are good and they're not in the EU so therefore we should leave seems a bit simplistic and may lead to false conclusions. Furthermore examining these three countries even for a few seconds shows that they're bad examples: Norway has so much oil and as we can never be like them, Iceland has a population of around 320,000 so modelling are decisions on there example would also be troublesome, and due to the common currency Switzerland has had huge troubles from not being in the EU. 

The arguments for the EU aren't 'hot air', conversely, they're measured in cold economic reality. It is estimated the amount of money we get back from the EU due to the increase in trade and the rebate is about 1.4 times more than we put in. What's more doubtful is the arguments against the EU as far as I can work out there are about four. 

1. You feel that democracy is not direct enough and you want to repatriate power to Westminster. This one is quite compelling until you actually look at what the EU laws are, they're things like fundamental, unarguable human rights and boring employment and economic laws which most people wouldn't care about.
2. You're worried about the future of the EU and how it might reshuffle in the favour of those with the Euro and to the detriment of us. However if you believe this will happen why leave now? Wait until it actually happens, don't agree to any changes and then leave the EU then. At least wait until discussions have developed a lot more than they have now.  
3. You're a racist. Most people who support this line of argument usually back it up with quasi-economic arguments that aren't backed in fact but rather rely on fear mongering. Most economists believe that immigration is good for the host country unless it becomes too rapid, and it's unlikely that is has reached that rate yet in the UK particularly as we are trying to encourage immigration from other parts of the world. 
4. Money. The UK is a net-contributour to the EU so if you're blind to all the other benefits it brings then it follows that if the UK leaves the government will have more money to spend itself. 

Not one of these four arguments seems more convincing than the actual, provable, economic benefit that being in the EU brings. 

Furthermore whether we should be in the EU or not shouldn't be down to a referendum. In theory the EU is still here to prevent a third world war, in practice it's become an economic entity.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Well, let me put it like this...

Huge war in middle-east is eventuality. Iran and Saudis will collide sooner or later with each others. Israel and Arabs will collide too, may take 20 years or 50, it will happen eventually. Eventually there will be a disruption thus the thing that we have to calculate how much is that going to cost for us.

One could say that...

* Trying to push start of conflict as future as possible will cost us less, because we have better technology then and we may have advanced our energy independence by then. However by pushing the conflict to future we risk having the conflict parties having better equipment and more parties having nuclear weapons. Each year Israel adds new nuclear weapons to its arsenal, and they have more or less published that if ever the Jewish state would be in danger to cease to exist, they would turn their weapons against those who didn't help them, the so called [Samson option](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option). This is a major risk to Europe and a future federated EU could and very well should make in case of emergency a first strike against Israel to annihilate its nuclear and air forces.
* Not doing anything and having the conflict and disruption as soon as possible could cost more as Europe is not energy independent, but then again, there are lesser risks on the conflict spilling to Europe, and the upshot is that any energy crisis would allow opportunity for European politicians and corporations to make push towards moving into Nuclear-Hydrogen economy that would create a huge European wide investment program that would fuel the economy and make Europe energy and fossil fuel independent.

Another thing to note is that by allowing a conflict in middle-east to blow up, it would bring down religious regimes in Saudi-Arabia and Gulf states, which by the way are huge financiers of international terrorism and religious radicalization. 

If I allow myself a little opportunistic thinking... A small or even bigger scale nuclear conflict in middle east would hurt most US that with the fall of Saudis would loose dollar status as reserve currency, it would also badly hurt China and the current communist party regime would probably fall if the Chinese economy would hit the wall. Europe would of course also be hurt, but because it is already more energy efficient than the US, and more prosperous and developed than China, it would more easily re-bounce and take over as leading power block.",0,1375182249,null,0,false,0,cbd8auz,t3_1j9ntt,t1_cbd8auz,t1_cbd12m2,null,1430042413,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

&gt; on a une immigration de plus en plus éduquée[5] et qui est donc de moins en moins en concurrence avec les ouvriers

Ton même lien montre que **75% des immigrés n'ont pas de diplôme du supérieur**. C'est mieux qu'avant, mais parler de tendance en omettant les données à jour est trompeur : l'écrasante majorité des immigrés sont non qualifiés et donc en concurrence avec les ouvriers.

&gt;Le fait de tirer les salaires à la baisse est plus ou moins un fantasme étant donné l'existence du SMIG puis du SMIC depuis les années 50

Encore une fois c'est imprécis : les études s’accordent généralement pour constater que l’immigration empêche les hausses de salaires au delà du salaire minimum pour les emplois non qualifiés. Ton lien sur le SMIG n'a rien de probant. Dans tous les cas, l'impact de l'immigration sur l'économie est faible et ne constitue pas un argument. C'est au peuple de décider s'il accueille de nouvelles personnes sur son territoire. Qu'on le laisse choisir s'il veut ouvrir les frontières, combien de gens veut-il accueillir et dans quelles conditions.

Pour les sources, tu peux regarder le [rapport du conseil d'analyse économique](http://www.cae.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/084.pdf), qui souligne la faiblesse de l'argument économique quand il s'agit de l'immigration, et montre que l'immigration favorise les patrons :

*Le fait que certains natifs rejettent certains types d’emplois peut simplement signifier que les travailleurs ont de meilleures opportunités que d’occuper ces emplois, et donc que les salaires correspondants devraient augmenter pour qu’ils soient pourvus.* [...] *Dans le cas du marché du travail, cela signifie qu’à la place de l’immigration des années soixante on aurait pu envisager une hausse du salaire des moins qualifiés.*

&gt;Plusieurs études démontrent que les immigrés apportent des points de croissance à l'Europe

Une simple courbe croissance / immigration montre que l'immigration n'apporte pas de croissance. Il y a également [cette étude de l'OCDE](http://www.oecd-berlin.de/charts/migration/fiscal.php?cr=oecd&amp;lg=fr) : l'immigration coûte 0.52% de PIB à la France en termes de recettes fiscales. Confirmé [dans cette étude de l'institut géopolitique des populations](http://www.institut-geopolitique-populations.fr/conferences_synthese.php), et dans ce

Dans tous les cas, il existe aussi de nombreuses études qui montrent qu'en période de récession et de chômage, l'immigration n'est pas utile et a d'autres motifs que les motifs économiques : 80% des immigrés viennent pour des raisons de regroupement familial et ne viennent pas pour travailler.

La vérité, c'est que l'immigration n'a qu'un impact limité sur l'économie (positif [ou négatif suivant ce que l'on regarde](http://www.le-cout-de-la-politique-migratoire.fr/)), que les immigrés sont [plus souvent au chômage](http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/2012-077.pdf), plus souvent délinquants, plus souvent sans diplômes, et que c'est au peuple de décider s'il veut les accueillir ou non.",0,1375182432,null,0,false,0,cbd8btv,t3_1j7rm6,t1_cbd8btv,t1_cbc5yls,null,1430042400,5,false,france,t5_2qhjz,5

true,Panto81,GERM,Germany,"So, I will try my hands at a post on germany. Many here seem to think being german means you don't have to be proud of much compared to others. I think that's wrong.
Throughout (european) history there have been many moments where germans shone or achieved things europe, or the world, profited from.
I won't go back to mediaval times as it is complicated to call the people from back then germans, french, polish or any other nationality we label ourselves to be today. 
For me I would start with Gutenberg's 'invention' of the printing-press in 1453 which allowed europeans quickly to share their thoughts thus leading to an age of discussion and reformation. And when it comes to reformation there is Martin Luther. Not only was he the first to translate the bible to german, but he also challenged the catholic church. Without Luther there wouldn't have been any Henry VIII. for example. German achievements didn't stop with Luther, but for more than onehundred years germans and other europeans fought each other over these new ideas on the what would later be german territories. when it all stopped in 1648 the germans had lost almost 30% of their people and many cities had been razed. Yet the germans recovered. Although they lacked behind in the creation of a national state compared to their neighbours it took them only 100 years to become one of the leading european nations in philosophy, music and the arts. Names like Beethoven, Bach, Kant and Schopenhauer are still well known today.
During the 19th century germany grew ever stronger. People started to demand civil rights. During the french occupation they had learned to enjoy the french laws and the Code Napoleon. The first german attempt to establish a democracy in 1848 failed. Many democrats were killed, others fled to the americas. Here they were staunch opponents to the practice of slavery which the german people in their majority always had despised. They knew how it felt not to be free.
In 1871 the german people finally got the national state they had long for. But it came at the price of making france an enemy for decades and giving up the idea of a democracy. 
Nevertheless the Reich prospered, conquered some colonies and for many german people a golden era followed. But europe is only so small. Soon people throughout europe were advocating a war to once and for all decide which nation should be the strongest (the own one, of course). Germans finally wanted to be acknowledged as an equal power by the french and british while these wanted germany to stay a 2nd grade power. we all knew how the war ended, how all the blame was put on the german people and how their hatred grew. The second attempt at establishing a democracy failed under such conditions. The NSDAP came to power, although with only 34% of the votes. What followed were germany's darkest years. Millions of people were murdered and war was waged against almost all nations surrounding germany. Up to this day it is a big question amongst germans how it could have come to this. 
Due to this past most germans have a different view on history. Most of us no longer see their nation's biggest achievements in wars won or lost long ago. Nor do we see glory in building empires or conquering other people. Wars and empires are always built upon the blood of innocent people. There's nothing to be proud of. The one thing most german people today can be proud of is to be able to see this fact. But maybe you first have to lose as a people to finally win the ability to see things as they are. A nation's true greatness is earned in times of peace due to the work of the common people.

* France has received (not always well!) many immigrants from Poland, Italy, Spain, Portugal up to the 70's.
* Gays have been treated relatively well in the past (there is no Alan Turing affair in France as far as I know)
* The head of the French Senate was black in the 60's.
* Also in 1806, the father of Alexandre Dumas became général and was half black.
* Being a jazz fan, I read that France is the second homeland of jazz, partly because many US black jazz musicians came to France to be treated as human beings and not as blacks.

Sure, there are racism problems in France, but IN THE PAST, France was pretty much better in this respect than any other country.

It was France's declaration of war against Austria that started the Revolutionary Wars (using the Declaration of Pillnitz as justification), which resulted in Prussia and the smaller German powers declaring on France in retaliation (they were allied with Austria). France's execution of Louis XVI resulted in Spain and Portugal declaring war on France. In 1793 France then declared war on the Netherlands and Britain.

English, German and maybe French as languages ( Nordic countries may have a different language). The military's of Germany, Austria and the Benelux in Center. France, Spain, Italy and Greece in South etc.

In terms of equipment, some things need to be slowly removed, like the Ariete and the Abrams. Slowly replace them with a more common tank like the Leopard. For an APC/IFV take something like the Swedish CV90 or the German Boxer.

Air force is a bit more tricky. The most simple thing would be for all nations to adopt the Eurofighter, but i don't see the French and the Swedish giving up on Dassault and Saab. This might actually be a good thing. The US Air Force also employs a wide range of planes for different roles. Let Saab, Dassault and EADS cooperate and provide Europa with a sufficient air force.

The combined European Navy would be the biggest navy in the world, with 66 Guided Missle Ships, 58 Submarines and 4 Aircraft Carriers it is a force to be reckoned with. I don't think there has to be much change in this area, European navies already cooperate much, so further integration should be a little bit easier then with the other branches.

In terms of size it should probably number a good 700k men and woman. Its main role should be to protect Europe while still being able to maintain the peace around the globe if needed. 

Nuclear weapons is more of a personal opinion. They are a useful deterrence but not really needed.

Please note that the above is a personal ''analyse'' of an armchair general and it would probably only work in an European Federation of some sort.

This wouldn't work in the current Union because the member states have different interests. If a military coup occurs in Suriname, do you really think that Danish marines would be willing to go in because the Netherlands want to?

Sorry for the wall of texts and the mediocre English.

Tl;DR = A real EU army would only be possible in a unified Europe.

&gt;the preservation of the language, both for them and for us, **happened on its own up until the 19th century**

How is language preservation happen on its own? Language is a living thing, sure, but its life comes from its users. It's not like Latin, a language that died and got preserved in a bottle. Romanian, Basque, Hungarian, French they evolved, changed with the times... Now, French went far away from Latin while Romanian stayed close to it. I'm no expert in finno-ugric languages, but it's not like Hungarians can just walk into a bakery in Tallinn and ask for a loaf of bread in Hungarian and expect to get it. Those cultural influences actually count... 

So, what's I'm talking about is an achievement by the Romanian people, done over centuries, passively or at least without a leader taking a decision to do this. It was thing by the people, for the people and at the end it's one of the best arguments that... we're a people. I like that...

true,calw,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Okay, I put my hands up, accusing people of being racist was a bad argument, but whether you're racist or not the anti-immigrant argument usually isn't based in fact but rather to do with scape-goating in tough times. 

To be honest, I think we will get a favourable deal with the EU but there's no guarantee that it will be as good as it is at the moment. As elasticity for EU imports to the UK is generally higher than it UK exports then our bargaining position is poor, and any trade restrictions will be to our detriment not theirs. Furthermore for us to have the full benefits of trade with the EU it would be best to have a free trade in goods, services and the factors of production as we have at the moment and this means that we're going to be linked with the EU anyway so why not at least stay in the EU so that we can attempt to have some say in what goes on within our closest trading partner? 

The reason that Iceland's size matters is that it means that they don't have such a diverse economy as ours. This means that they are extremely reliant on fishing and therefore the restrictions on fishing are more detrimental than the gain in trade. In fact if these restrictions on fishing were lifted Iceland would join the EU, as they have been trying to do. Not for a sustained period but I have been Norway for about a week and I've been to Switzerland twice for a bit more than a week each time. It's not really relevant though is it? My argument isn't that life as we know it would cease to exist, I don't think that those outside of the EU29 are living some subhuman, primordial life. Any improvements, or indeed problems, that I saw with these countries compared to EU ones may not be necessarily to do with whether or not they were in the EU. Canada and Japan both have their own trade agreements within their own neighbours, but as they're in different geographical and political climates a different type of union is more beneficial. 

Declining by what measure? In terms of economic growth that is only a recent problem and there's no evidence to say that it will become the trend. The US are currently interested in starting a trade agreement with the EU, and in turn joining the EU with Mexico and Canada, and has explicitly mentioned in both private and public that it would like the UK to stay within the EU for the purpose of trade. Even if what you say is true, which I don't think it is, we can't change the past and at this point the best position to encourage trade with anyone is through the EU as it means that the UK can encourage FDI from businesses who want to trade within the EU. It is better for these businesses to be in a big market such as the EU as there is room to expand rather than a small one like an independent UK. 

I wasn't using the human rights argument, because I think it's absurd as well, I was just giving an example of the kind of laws that the EU pass. 

I'm not 'plotting to basically overthrow' my own government because I want the power whether to leave or not to be with our government and, furthermore, the EU is hardly overthrowing the UK government and nor will it ever be. Democracy only works if the people are educated and enthusiastic enough about the particular issue and unless you think the majority of this country understands the implications of the CAP I don't see how they could vote on the EU.",0,1375187093,null,0,false,0,cbd9480,t3_1jc5me,t1_cbd9480,t1_cbd8ke5,null,1430042032,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"OK I will make one attempt. Not sure it will help because your type is generally unconvincable towards every idea that is outside the leftist norm (I know because I was - I was very, very afraid of affirming ideas that would make me look like a then-loathed reactionary conservative bigot), but there could be other reading it.

I have not used the term ""immoral"". First at least get right what you are arguing with.

The natural occurence is a tougher nut to crack, and it is not something that can be put in black/white binary terms. Generally speaking what is NEVER superior is pure wishful thinking, subjective choice or desire, in other words a religious respect for autonomy and equality, that is generally inferior to anything else.

Compared to this and  this only, naturalness has the advantage of being evolved for a function. Except that organisms are complex, and functions cannot always be fully separated, so the safest bet is always to go for the whole package deal. Generally speaking to keep an organism healthy and happy, you have to get close to its natural environment.

For example, when we keep animals in a zoo, we generally try to emulate their natural environment as best as we can. We don't really try to separate functions, for example we don't do stuff like figuring out that the reason hippos need swimming is both exercise and getting their skin wet, so we can replace that with a treadmill in the shower maybe? We don't, we just build a fucking swimming pool for them and expect them to function OK in it. As in being healthy and naturally happy as best as they can.

Not everything that occurs in nature is automatically a good idea, we don't make the the crocodiles try to hunt the hippo babies in the zoo, we actually have to use judgement here. I know lefties loath that, the idea of actually using judgement and case by case decisions, because it enables arbitrariness and there is nothing lefties fear more than arbitrary decisions, but not everything can be codified into a clear rule.

Similarly, human well-being cannot entirely be based on purely ideological ideas like maximal equality and maximal autonomy which is based on Age of Enlightenment ideals that are rooted in nothing but speculative philosophy. It was precisely the Enlightenment era when psychology and suchlike were at their minimum i.e. even worse than in the Middle Ages when there was at least a good common sense psychology provided by the scholastics.

Again the important aspect here is not that what is natural is always superior, but that the natural is at least rooted in actualy biological function, while the ""church of autonomy"", shit like ""what is freely chosen is always good"" is not rooted in anything.

Although obviously it can be improved on, the general ""zoo"" idea that human well-being is improved by simulating a natural, ""caveman"" environment is a good start. Paleo diet works for example. 

Now with interpersonal behavior, the good part is that we had the ""caveman"" environment basically up to modern times, throughout history. We don't even have to go back to the paleolithic to find ideas. Paleolithic man and the man of 1900 were very similar, in this aspect, understanding masculinity as essentially dominance. 

This makes a very strong argument that it may be actually good for us.

Most of this is common sense, history and basic logic. There is a growing science of it, but it is not yet a science based thing, most of it can be figured out without science, the same way people could do agriculture before biology as a science was invented. But for example we see [experiments](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6461.html) suggesting that dominant behaviors increase testosterone levels, and studies suggesting that [male depression may be caused by low testosterone levels](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12523867). This is slowly growing. But we can still use common sense as well.

Ultimately we have two choices. One is the Age of Enlightenment focus on autonomy and equality, this is basically like a religion, it says they are good for us but never makes a good case why. It is rooted in a pseudo-religious idea that the subjective equals the good.

If we consider it insane - it is - and want to undo the damage caused by the last 300 years of pseudointellectual bullshit, we have to adopt the assumption that there is probably such a thing as objective well-being, that it is at least theoretically possible to figure out what is actually good for us instead of this blind reverence for choice.

And if we do that, like in the zoo, the first place we look for clues for what could be actually good for us is of course nature.

To use your example (BTW I don't understand why is everybody so interested in gays on Reddit? I would much rather focus on how hetero dynamics work, fixing those relationships bring more utility in the short run.):

Pre-Modern, Pre-Enlightenment: ""Homosex is immoral.""

Modern, Post-Modern, Enlightenment: ""Any consensual sexual intercourse between adults is OK."" (i.e. free choice = good)

Post-Post-Modern, Neoreaction, Enlightenment 2.0 or The Dark Enlightenment: ""Actually social acceptance of male-submissive sexual behaviors and with that low-testosterone behaviors may have a total negative effect on well-being.""

With that the gay topic is closed on my part, I don't understand why do we have to talk so much about a 3-5% weirdos who make less than 1% of the parents. I care about the future, that means kids, that means parents, that means predominantly straight people, so I don't want to waste so much time on discussing gays.

(I think the reason the gay topic is so popular today is that in every age and period leftist intellectuals need a way to stigmatize their opponents,   in the past it was for example the aristocrat or later the capitalist, later the war-monger, today the gay-hater is the stigma of the heretic.)",0,1375187268,null,0,false,0,cbd95hs,t3_1iy1wa,t1_cbd95hs,t1_cbd8k09,null,1430042016,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Romans were, in fact, the first who unified Italy, and give it the name of ""Italia"".

So, Romans created Italy. After the disgregation of the Empire, all our production has been influenced by the Latin culture, slighty strongly than other Europe.

So now we're not Latin either because we're watching Hollywood movies and we're using a keyboard to write instead of a rock and chisel like the good Romans? 

If you're going to spill out other people's ideas, at least understand them first. Are you saying that at one point Petru Maior said: ""we're going to be Latin"", and the people that used to talk Greek but write with cyrilic letters formed a language that we now call Romanian? And do we really get our latin character from the French? And what about those that went to school in Austria (or its equivalent)? How come they ""came back"" with the same kind of ideas: that we're Latin? I think the book you read forgot to mention that at that time there was something going on in Europe: nationalism.

Today it's you who is disgusted by the fact that you can't just deal with the criminal ""in the good old way"", tomorrow you are the person who is wrongly accused but spared from the pitchforks.

It is also very important to note that a society that insists on the rule of law does not do it because it is condoning criminal action, or is lenient towards it - quite to the contrary. It is showing that its principles are independent from any individual person (preserving the neutrality of our laws), and upholding the most difficult aspects of our legal systems (innocent until proven guilty, no mistreatment in prison).

It does so *because it is difficult*, not because it is easy. 

Only through this can a society retain its ability to be orderly through ideological means, and not through excessive force. Take this to reflect for a moment how easily it is to commit crimes in our society. 

So what stops you? An ethical belief in it being wrong, or a belief in the effectiveness of the judicial system?

For both, we need this public assurance that *it works*, for everyone equally, no matter the severity of the crimes. If you make too many exceptions, the magic is lost. The story is over. Rule of law becomes a joke, and not the threatening and sheltering entity that makes you feel safe in your own home.

Modern society rests on a ton of useful lies. Justice is one of them, and we need this modern-day ritual, even though we all know how it will end.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;And what on Earth do you mean by

&gt;&gt;the preservation of the language, both for them and for us, happened on its own up until the 19th century

That there was no conscious effort to preserve the language. It just got preserved. Sure, mothers teach their children their language, but there was no pan-Romanian movement to not speak something else. It was simply what mother so. They do it anywhere else.

&gt;So, what's I'm talking about is an achievement by the Romanian people, done over centuries, passively or at least without a leader taking a decision to do this.

Exactly. There is no ""achievement"" when there is no intent. It's like being proud that you managed to grow tall.

&gt;Now, French went far away from Latin while Romanian stayed close to it. 

It stayed close in some aspects, and ""went away"" in others.

&gt;I'm no expert in finno-ugric languages, but it's not like Hungarians can just walk into a bakery in Tallinn and ask for a loaf of bread in Hungarian and expect to get it. Those cultural influences actually count... 

This is totally irrelevant to the point. Also, FYI, Hungarian and Estonian are from separate branches of the Finno-Ugric family. Talking Hungarian in Estonia is like talking Romanian in Iran.

Also, do you think the Lithuanians should be proud of the fact that the Lithuanian language stayed close to its Proto-Indo-European roots?

&gt; So, why is Northern Europe, i.e. the Eurozone’s surplus nations, so steadfast in its determination to maintain an architecture that was designed for a time when the United States played a role it can no longer fulfil? I fear that there are two powerful, intertwined, yet utterly irrational, reasons. The first one was conveyed to me by one of the German Chancellor’s close economic advisers. His simple point was that instituting a proper intra-European surplus recycling mechanism (like our Modest Proposal2) would mean that Germany would never be able to leave the Eurozone in the future. It would, effectively, be giving up the Get-Out-Of-Here card that only surplus nations truly possess currently (since deficit nations know that an exit from the common currency area would mean a massive capital outflow and a subsequent collapse of their banking sector). “It is not, of course, that the German Chancellor wants to use this card in order to exit the Eurozone”, my interlocutor continued. “No, she just loves having it because the fact that the French President is lacking one, as are the Italian and Spanish Prime Ministers, grants her an exorbitant degree of bargaining power within the European Council, the Eurogroup etc.”

Mind you, some people have expressed their reservations on whether these stories this guy tells are genuine encounters with Merkel's advisers, but I personally have no reason to distrust him.

But here's my definiton of 'nonsense' in this context: a mode of argumentation that is its own counter mode of argument.

Quite simple, in mathematics it's an inverse.

Why do I think it's stupid? Because if the above holds, I can use it to counter-counter it again, and then use it to counter-counter-counter it again, etc. 

In essence, an infinite regress. And that's quite inconventient in an argument where you want to come to a conclusion in finite time (because you won't, because you can do it for an infinite amount of time and never get to a resolution).

So maybe my objection is based on computational theory. But it is clear that this cannot lead to the solution of an argument, and I want that solution.

Of course, if you just want to argue for the sake of arguing, then be my guest. But I think I leave that for people who like to hear themselves talk more than finding reasonable common-ground.

E' come imparare 3 lingue insieme perchè è una lingua senza tempi verbali nè flessione morfemica. Ogni parola è una sillaba, che si scrive con dei caratteri che sono assolutamente necessari per diventare un parlante decente. In più, c'è un'omofonia diffusa in questa lingua: ogni sillaba può avere dai 30 ai 40 significati diversi. A complicare ancora le cose, ci sono i toni: 4 toni più uno neutro. Ogni tono dà alla sillaba un significato diverso, senza del quale nessuno capirà mai quello che dici nè tu capirai mai quello che dicono loro. Ricordo di aver studiato duramente per 2 anni prima di venire qui a studiare in Cina, e ricordo benissimo la frustrazione di non capire niente e non essere capito nonostante svariate ore di studio. Fidati di me: ti serve un insegnante madrelingua.

In poche parole, quando impari una parola nuova, devi studiare: pronuncia fonetica, tono, carattere, uso. E quando ascolti una parola nuova da qualcuno, a meno che tu non abbia almeno 8 anni di studi alle spalle, non saprai mai come si scrive e come si pronuncia a meno che non te lo insegnano pazientemente.

EDIT: a complicare ancora le cose, è una lingua che non si impara seguendo delle regole. Il più delle volte, quando chiedi al professore ""perchè si dice così? che regola c'è dietro"" ti risponde ""perchè sì"".

EDIT 2: se ti dico ""shishi"", per esempio. Senza toni non sarebbe possibile comprendere niente. A seconda dei toni può significare: ""rendere effettivo"", ""epico"", ""prestare giuramento"", ""inaccurato"", ""perdere l'occasione"", ""spesso"", ""fatto storico"", ""pietre e lance"", ""fatto/questione"", ""momento appropriato"", ""storia della poesia"", ""trattare qualcuno con il rispetto che si deve a un insegnante"", ""incidente"", ""perdere potere"", ""perdere la propria madre"", ""agente"", ""epoca"", ""affari attuali"", ""ultima moda"", ""cose pratiche"", ""tutto"", ""entrare in carica"", ""morire"", ""in realtà"".

Posso farti un altro esempio con la sillaba ""ma"": 

妈 *ma* (primo tono) significa ""mamma""

麻 *ma* (secondo tono) significa ""lino, tessuto""

马 *ma* (terzo tono) significa ""cavallo""

骂 *ma* (quarto tono) significa ""bestemmiare, insultare""

吗 *ma* (tono neutro) è una particella che significa ""?"" (punto interrogativo). 

E non ho neanche esaurito tutti i ""ma"" della lingua cinese.

EDIT 3: Ricordo un giorno che stavo bevendo un caffè, ho chiesto lo zucchero (*tang*, secondo tono), ma ho sbagliato il tono e mi hanno portato una zuppa (*tang* primo tono).

I don't even think you can do offers via Idealista, can you? All you can do is call a seller or landlord and talk with them, or send them an email. Sites like Trulia let you do that, but also actively bid for the apartment, see if you're ahead in the bidding, etc.",0,1375191128,null,0,1375191471,0,cbda240,t3_1jak14,t1_cbda240,t1_cbd9waz,null,1430041593,0,false,Madrid,t5_2si9y,0

Richtig.

&gt;Es gibt jetzt ne Nische für kleine Cafés, die dort jetzt eröffnen können und Umsatz machen werden, da die Leute nichtmehr zum Starbucks laufen können.

Du allerdings auch nicht.

&gt;Kleine Cafés sind sowieso viel gemütlicher und persönlicher als ein Starbucks.

Das muss nicht unbedingt ein Vorteil sei, mit Blick auf das unterschiedliche Publikum. Omi-Cafés sind offenbar keine Lösung, siehe den bereits zitierten Abschnitt:

&gt;Standke, 39, findet, *dass es kaum Cafés in der Gegend gibt, in denen sich Jüngere treffen können oder wo auch junge Familien gerne hingehen.* 

&gt;Ihr sei es egal, ob es sich bei Starbucks um einen Großkonzern handele, ""ich würde gerne auch in ein anderes Café, wenn es nicht so wäre, *dass man ständig in Sorge sein muss, dass die Kinder zu laut sein könnten"".*

Ich kann den Gedanken nicht loswerden, daß wegen der Abneigung gegen einen US-Großkonzern das eigentliche Problem - kein geeigneter Treffpunkt für junge Menschen und Familien in Zehlendorf - unbeachtet bleibt.

Combattre le FN, c'est favoriser les deux grands. La priorité, c'est de remettre en question l'UMPS, donc mécaniquement d'aller vers le 3ème parti. Si Mélenchon était 3ème (s'il était soutenu par les prolétaires), bien que FrancMac et trotskiste, je voterai pour lui.

What people always forget is that tradition can be a highly positive influence as well - civic activism is also gained by having a strong sense of duty gained through a feeling of historical continuity. And such activism is essential for a modern democracy.

Next to the negative militaristic and oppresive current in Germany (or European) history, I think  there exists another (again, in all of Europe): liberal, empathic, rationalist.

For all our wars - I'm talking European scale now - we have also struggled to be more free, less cruel to the weakest members of our society, less frightened by the world that surrounds us and set to take control of our own destiny.

It is the one that gave us our philosophers, scienists, engineers, and our liberal/socialist revolutionaries.

what conversation takes place in your head?

&gt;rock and chisel like the good Romans

It is obvious that history is a foreign subject to you.

&gt;If you're going to spill out other people's ideas, at least understand them first. 

I do understand them, but take your own advice before debating an idea try to understand it.

&gt;Are you saying that at one point Petru Maior said: ""we're going to be Latin""

Now he simply observed, that the colloquial language was based on latin, like the Italian language, and less on slaves like Serbian. He used this to promote a nationalist idea of a nation that (despite the nationalistic fairytales) was unexistent at that time among the 3 nations.
This was a counterpoint to Hungarian nationalism that was raging at that time and aligned itself with the hunger for autonomy in Valachia and Moldavia. 

Nobody decided to be ""latin"", the notion simply became a tool to create a national identity common to the 3 principalities.

&gt;at that time there was something going on in Europe: nationalism

Maybe someday I will argue why nationalism is an illusion and one of the most horrible and necessary concepts that plagued the human mind. But today I'll only say that nationalism is a propagandistic tool to counter imperialist cultural dominance, it is built, by the cultural environment of a nation. 

In the sixteenth century the cultural environment of the small Romanian cities was speaking Hebrew, Bulgarian, Greek and Turkish, most of the sons of Traian where still living in the countryside in the dark ages. 

Our monasteries where built by greeks, our cities by french architects. Even our glorious birocracy was imposed by the Phanariots that modernised the country to such a level that our national bourgeoisie was able to develop and establish a national identity. You have to understant that before the nineteen century there where no nations there where kingdoms, all the ancestry bullshit is written in after the fact to make people feel like they have a heritage(it's the pragmatics religion).

 The next time a detail misses from the official history book/turist guide, look it up and I guarantee your find a foreign name, for everything before 1850.

mmm, yes and no. 

Rome has been a city-state, but after the Republican period, Rome became the capital city of a Empire. In this Empire, Italy was the ""main province"", the territory directly controlled by Rome. In 200 AC, moreover, there were 2 Italia: Italia suburbicaria and Italia annonaria, with capital Mediolanum. Italia suburbicaria was the one controlled by Rome. 

There were OTHER cities-state*, or city with a sort of indipendence, heritage of the ancient peoples (sunniti, liguri, greeks) before the Romans, but the large mayority of Italian penisnula was under the control of Rome.

The phrase ""Italy ruled Europe"", was obviously a sort of joke. Italy was the name of the territory in control of Rome, which was quite exactly the modern Italy, and Rome ruled Europe. And a piece of Africa.

Yes.

&gt;Wouldn't it, in that context, also be the best for the society at whole, to letting the dynamic of some individuals being more dominant, and others being more submissive sort itself out? Basically, the more dominant males will strive towards dominance either way, and there will always be less dominant individuals.

Yes of course. Why do yo think I am very much focused on restriction? I don't have the ridiculous aversion to it, but it does not mean I would use it as a magic cure-it-all. There are 100 ways the world could be made more masculine with more libertarianism, not less. Legalizing duels, firearms, cutting taxes and having the welfare system focus on the truly  helpless and so on. 

Having said that, it is precisely the propensity to violence that creates the need for more rigid hierarchies, so that there are legal, civilized ways of determining rank and making decisions in a team. 

If your goal is to reduce violence, especially deadly violence, basically if I got right prevent a potential WW3, there are actually traditional forms of it in the sense that old ideas that were tested and usually worked:

- Accept and sometimes even encourage more controlled forms of violence. Encourage every young boy to learn martial arts or boxing, as they teach just as much if not more self control than aggression. Do not encourage, but accept dueling, self defense firearms (registration, psychological check ups, safety courses and all that are OK), and so on.

- Accept more rigid hierarchies.

- Encourage traditional formal politeness, as they are meant precisely for preventing violence. It was always the most aggressive, say, Castilian nobility, who had very rigid etiquette because this very regulated behavior was meant to prevent not offending and not killing each other.

- Push honor-based, pride-based ethics as an alternative to compassion based ethics. You can't really tell a violent person to not hurt someone weak out of compassion, that never works. But in a honor or pride based ethical system, you can say don't hurt the weak person because it does not prove your strength, in fact it may show that you are insecure.",0,1375192582,null,0,false,0,cbdagyv,t3_1iy1wa,t1_cbdagyv,t1_cbd9m3h,null,1430008574,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

After 1953 we built the huge structures called [Deltawerken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Works), which would protect certain vulnerable parts of the Netherlands from floods. 
* We funded the city which can now be considered one of the greatest cities ever: New York (or New Amsterdam as it was called back then). And we found the Cape Colony, which eventually became South Africa. Afrikaans is still a language derived from Dutch and the *Boer people* are farmers of Dutch ancestry. We also discovered Australia and called it New Holland, until the English came and claimed it.

Bonus points for:

* Conquering England during the Glorious Revolution.
* Capturing a Spannish treasure fleet. [Piet Hein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_in_the_Bay_of_Matanzas) is considered a national hero (overrated, but anyway cool) for capturing the fleet, the treasure's worth is probably around 11 milion Guilders.

Also, I can't see a great difference between 16th century Romanian burgs and the dark ages in the burgs of western Europe. So, if you're trying to divide the country between urban and rural, you're in the wrong ages... Also, in those times nobody wanted to stay in towns, except for traders (which were usually foreign). So yeah, they were speaking their own language. And... ? The ""Romanian"" nobility lived in the countryside where they could exploit the land and the people better.

&gt;Nobody decided to be ""latin"", the notion simply became a tool to create a national identity common to the 3 principalities.

So you're fighting the ghost of some guy using the Latin character of our language to unite the Romanian provinces. First off, that guy doesn't exist and the provinces are already united... Then, I'm not saying anything more about this whole thing except: we're latin, good thing we're latin (I got to learn French pretty fast and I understand Italian without learning it)...

I was tough in a school that our Commonwealth was the golden age for both: Polish and Lithuanian people, something BOTH of our nations should be PROUD of as back in the day we made the largest country in Europe, and certainly one of most powerful.

I know that Polish minority in Lithuania sometimes seems to be slightly aggressive, but TBH: I can't blame them when I hear that Lithuanians force Poles to abandon their names and use Lithuanian spelling for them (which is ridiculous - now when I live as an immigrant in UK noone even considered anything like that and they approach topic with respect, probably more of it than I have).

Still though I think this whole conflict between Polish and Lithuanian people is a huge bubble that grew up from some negative propaganda of the governments. I really hope that next generation of people will learn to enjoy bright sides of our join venture in Commonwealth era trying to build a friendly relations in modern world, cause after all - that's what matters now.

* [Andrzej-Frycz Modrzewski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Frycz_Modrzewski) philosopher and political theorist, considered the ""Father of Polish Democracy""
* As for getting rid of the Communist Regime it may have been without bloodshed, but the sheer amount of corruption, chains of blackmailing, and networking (between the members of the regime and the new opposition) is something that is astounding. Arguably, the lack of lustration and the exact path of the transition in Poland greatly affects the present day situation in the country. Not only were the nitty gritty details extremely corrupt and the subsequent privatisation efforts of the 1990s were nothing more than relocating state enterprises or the profits of them into the hands of a few ""elite"" group of people, but the symbolic nature of the transition was also something were we failed. The whole lack of lustration that I mentioned earlier mixed in with the ""Thick Line"" mantra and other policies meant that Poland was never able to deal with Communism and the Communist Legacy. The precedent was set in the late 80s and early 90s that essentially granted legal immunity to the old regime and has adversely affected the development political memory in Poland - and in turn contemporary politics. So many of the problems that we see in Poland are very much so extensions of unresolved problems and issues of the 80s and the transition. 

If you are interested more in the concept of political memory and lustration and the impact and relationship it had during and after the transition I highly recommend the following article (Leszek Koczanowicz - The Memory of Politics and the Politics of Memory: Reflections on the Construction of the Past in Post-Totalitarian Poland):

true,WhosYourPapa,GREE,Greece,"Really cannot believe that 6 hours later there isn't a single post about our little country. There's so much to be proud of (also quite a bit to be a bit embarrassed of). 

First, there's the whole democracy thing and the development of one of the strongest Ancient Empires. We were so good that the Romans basically took everything we did and gave it different names and claimed it for themselves (only partly kidding). 

It's always complicated looking at the Byzantine Empire, because I think it's a stretch to try and attribute it to any one country today, however the Greek influence there is very strong. The academic and theological advancements in that time period were mostly developed by Greek scholars in the Byzantine Empire. That's something to be proud of I think.

Our fight for independence against the Ottomans is one of the most important national moments in our history. After being oppressed for 400 years, rising up for our religious and political freedom is something to be very proud of, even if it was with considerable help from Western Europe. This I think leads conveniently to my next point.

It has been theorized (correctly or not, you choose) that Greece was one of the main saviors for the Allies in WWII. Essentially, the Italians, without telling the Third Reich, decided to invade Greece after Metaxa refused an Italian Ultimatum. The Greeks counterattacked and moved into Albania forcing the Italians to retreat. It was the first Allied victory on the Continent. The Germans had to come to the Italians aid in order to put down the Greek resistance, which forced them to postpone their invasion of Soviet Russia, pushing it later into the year and closer to the Winter.... and we all know what happened to Germany in the Russian winter.

Obviously today we have less to be proud of with the current economic crisis and what we may or may not have done to bring it about. I have my own views on the matter, but that isn't what this thread is about. As a Greek, a proud Greek at that, I am ashamed of the Golden Dawn movement and what it stands for. However, contrary to what people who have no understanding of the situation believe, they are *FAR* from the majority. We have a saying in Greece, ""the dumbest voice is usually the loudest."" I think that's suitable here. I will say that I am proud of how our society has not unraveled yet, even in the face of economic destruction.

true,elphieLil84,sardegna,,"Verissimo. La mentalità del ""fatti furbo e incula gli altri"" é ben radicata da secoli. Abbiamo avuto però un periodo, dai tempi di DeAmicis dell'alba della borghesia italiana fino al '68, dove almeno in pubblico e nei media, c'era un'idea di decenza e di giusto e sbagliato ben diversa.

Soprattutto nell' Italia post guerra l'immagine del lavoro duro e onesto, della frugalità e della semplicità familiare erano la narrativa corrente. Il 68 ha portato riforme e diritti fondamentali, ma anche gli orribili concetti di politicamente corretto, borghesia e buonismo considerati in senso negativo.

 Tutto ciò che era semplice, parco, severo, diventa oscurantista. Mentre gli altri diventavano più liberi come individui, noi ci sentivamo più liberi di dar sfogo ai nostri peggiori istinti sociali.

Libertà diventa libertà di barare, di essere volgari, di irridere la cultura, di ignorare le regole. Ci passò anche il '68, reo di non essere abbastanza ""vero"" (leggi:troppo acculturato, troppo mentale).

Il bagaglino, i filmetti soft anni 70, tonnellate di sottocultura e poca conoscenza delle lingue contribuirono a tenerci sempre più lontani dal resto d'Europa e del mondo. Non ricevendo i loro media, o ricevendoli mediati da doppiaggio o censura, siamo rimasti pacificamente isolati da tante cose.

Il familismo latente e chiuso a riccio si é accentuato. La meritocrazia é diventata irrealistica, il bene comune come bussola di comportamento individuale pure. Ridicolo enunciare questi concetti come auspicare la pace nel mondo in pubblico, a meno che non sia il Papa. Lo snobismo verso la cultura si è tradotto in case senza libri, libri sempre più costosi e analfabetismo di ritorno rampante. Poco inglese, l'ossessione per le materie umanistiche e l'eloquenza superficiale e il disprezzo latente per la scienza ci hanno tenuti lontani dai computer. E anche coi computer, il poco inglese ci ha tenuti lontani dal vero Internet, impedendo alle masse di confrontarsi davvero con altre culture.

Berlusconi ha preso al volo le peggiori tendenze post sessantottine. Ha portato le tette perché liberazione sessuale per gli italiani era libertà di veder donne nude, non di rendere il sesso una cosa sana, normale e bella, ma soprattutto paritaria. One night stands e sex talk fanno ancora arrossire e ridacchiare la gente, con tutti i culi e le tette che vediamo in tv.

Berlusconi ha anche portato in auge il talkshow. Date al popolo la possibilità di parlare!! Ma anziché creare un setting civile con domande serie (tipo un Question Time), vai di Maurizio Costanzo show, un mix di liti e gentaglia alla Jerry Springer, tv del dolore e sfogo ai peggiori istinti. Perché la voluttà delle lacrime e del dolore viscerale é il porno autorizzato della casalinga, il suo solo brivido.

Per evitare il paternalismo si é creata una narrativa per la quale se poni limiti agli istinti più bassi ""non sei vero"", e se ti indigni sei ipocrita, ""che tanto le fai anche tu 'ste cose"".

Berlusconi, da bravo venditore, ha captato una domanda latente. Avevamo queste tendenze da tenere a bada, con scuola, politica, cultura e media. Tutte queste istituzioni hanno fallito. Inibito da accuse di paternalismo ed oscurantismo, ci hanno dato quello che volevamo, e questi sono i risultati. 

Poche famiglie hanno mantenuto i vecchi ideali di lavoro duro,  cultura e decenza. Hanno creato alieni in patria, che oggi, pian piano, non potendo più vivere nell' antitesi di tutto quello per cui sono stati cresciuti, stanno scappando.

Per questo ci vorrà più di un lavoro per farli tornare. Ci vuole qualcosa che li convinca che non sia una pazzia crescere i loro figli in questo Paese.",0,1375197912,null,0,false,0,cbdcaxi,t3_1jc4dh,t1_cbdcaxi,t1_cbd7z42,null,1430007719,11,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,11

L'argument est faible. Ce n'est pas parce que c'est une construction intellectuelle que c'est voué à disparaître. La Chine n'est pas vouée à disparaître, les États-Unis ne sont pas voués à disparaître, ainsi que la Russie et beaucoup d'autres.

La nation, c'est le plus grand dénominateur commun d'un peuple permettant d'assurer sa souveraineté et son indépendance.

D'ailleurs on voit bien que le principal ennemi des oligarques, c'est la nation. Ainsi, les puissants essaient d'asseoir leur domination en détruisant les nations pour mieux asservir les peuples.

Humainement, je ne vois pas non plus en quoi l'Europe est une réussite : taux de chômage le plus élevé du monde, [abstention en hausse continue](http://www.lemonde.fr/elections-europeennes/article/2009/06/07/abstention-record-en-europe_1203645_1168667.html), rejet des référendums, [montée des extrêmes](http://elections.lefigaro.fr/presidentielle-2012/2012/04/26/01039-20120426ARTFIG00521-montee-de-l-extreme-droite-en-europe-des-origines-diverses.php) (et je ne parle évidemment pas du FN, mais bien de néonazis).

Pour finir, avec [un taux de fécondité de 1,57](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9mographie_de_l'Union_europ%C3%A9enne#Statistiques_diverses), l'Europe est un continent vieillissant et déprimé qui ne saurait être porteur d'avenir.

3.

However, a couple of things: how's your German? I know a lot of engineering and physical science programs are taught in English these days, but medicine I'm not so sure.

true,shackleton1,EURO,European Union,"Australia, with Ireland and the Suez Crisis runners up.

British foreign policy, while horrific to us, is largely of its time. The Atlantic slave trade was a pretty small fraction of slavery going on in the world at the time. While the Empire was oppressive, it's not like the local dictatorships it overtook were bastions of enlightenment. Furthermore, British foreign policy was rarely genocidal. War in medieval times was brutal. The Opium Wars were a dick move but pretty conventional.

Ireland is the closest Britain comes to genocide *edit: or maybe Australia, see below*. In fact, I think you could comfortably call earlier (pre 19thc) foreign policy with regard to Ireland as ethnic cleansing; and perhaps post as well. The consensus of historians is that the Great Famine wasn't a genocide, but for the impact it had it might as well have been.

The Suez crisis might seem like a strange runner up, given that only a few thousand died. But it was a war of agression that took place in 1956. 1956! Unlike most of the bad stuff Britain has done, the Suez crisis was *not* of its time. It was a 19th century imperial war launched in the 20th century, post WW2 when it was pretty well established that wars of agression were bad. In 1956 there is simply no excuse to launch such a war.

*Edit* I forgot about Australia.

true,maripool,null,null,"Ah, erste Bundestagswahl. Ich find's toll, dass Du Dich gleich engagierst! Und die Erfahrung einer möglichen tiefen Enttäuschung muss jeder für sich selbst machen. ;-)

Für mich haben die Grünen (ich war immer Grünenwähler) nach 1998 ihre Ideale verraten, gerade bei den Bürgerrechten. Und wie das so ist mit enttäuschter Liebe, sind sie mir bis heute deshalb unsympathischer als die anderen. Die Grünen betrieben ja selbst an der Regierung ihr perfektioniertes Doppelspiel: Wem die Entscheidungen nicht gefielen, konnte sich mit den innerparteilichen Alibi-Moralisten Ströbele und Roth trösten, die fleissig dagegen zeterten. Neee, danke. Für mich zählt seither einzig Abstimmungsverhalten, wenn jemand in der Regierung ist (Die CDU versucht wenigstens gar nicht erst, einen auf moralisch zu machen).

Rot/Grüns Leistung war auch für mich der Atomausstieg, aber schon die Irakverweigerung empfand ich mehr als Populismus, der auf die herrschende Bush-Ablehnung aufbaute und nicht auf tiefer Überzeugung.

Am Ende muss halt jeder schauen, wo seine Prioritäten liegen. Mit 20 war es für mich auch mehr im Sozialen, aber desto älter ich werde, desto wichtiger finde ich Bürgerrechte, etc. als Basis-Fundament eines Staates. Dafür standen halt FDP und Grüne. Die FPD enttäuschte mich mit dem Grossen Lauschangriff (1996?) und die Grünen dann eben später. 

Für die Piraten sind Bürgerrechte die innerste Kernkompetenz. Hier ""Verrat"" zu begehen wäre wie für die Grünen ein neues AKW zu bauen. Deshalb werde ich vermutlich dabei bleiben. Und vielleicht auch wieder Wahlkampf machen, wenn mein Frust über PRISM noch wächst (übrigens kein Wunder, dass die SPD bei dem Thema relativ low profile fährt - weil sie nix ändern werden!).

Zum Topic: Bei meinem Wahlengagement damals überraschte mich die Solidarität unter den Parteien. Egal ob CDU, SPD, Grüne, Linke. Das war ein fairer Wettstreit und alle begegneten sich sehr freundschaftlich (die Wahlstände lagen wie fast überall nahe beieinander - intern ""Parteienstrich"" genannt ;-).

I don't think this position is defensible for Germany. That widow with five children who claims she has to feed her children on 2.5 Euro a month? In my state, a person in her situation would get around 2000 Euro per month in unemployment money, plus rent, so keep that in mind when you watch a video where they just before that part said that millions of Germans make less than 400 Euro a month. Yeah, there are Germans who make this little money *from their job*, but if we're talking about total income it's simply not possible because the minimum unemployment money for one adult is just short of 400 Euro plus rent. If you make less than you'd get in unemployment money, you can apply for it - you don't actually need to be unemployed. There are other programs too if you need help with paying rent, of course there's child support too, and so on.

No amount of money will put a single mother of five in a good position. Even if she did find employment, how is that supposed to work with five children? Her children, however, do have a perspective. They have health insurance, they're going to school, the state will support them if they qualify for university. This is not the kind of perspective they'd have in a state that actually didn't try to enable its poor to build a better life.

true,myekename,null,null,"I lived in Jaen doing just that (albeit teaching at a different school).  This post just made me so excited!  I will give you all the information I can here, or feel free to message me with any questions!

&gt;I know relatively little about Jaén and would love to get some more insight about the area.

Jaen is definitely one of the lesser known, lesser visited areas of the highly popular Andalucia area.  You are correct in thinking that it does have loads of olive trees.  It is in fact the biggest producer of olive trees per capita in the entire world.  Because of this, you will find that almost all of the terrain looks [like this](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR385giKNXuSxzfig-5rnle0d3ybqGSA4yyc1fM20iCFW_hGQl0).  It also has a huge impact on their local economy.  When it's not olive harvest season, the area has an unemployment rate of around 60%, which hits especially hard in the little towns  outside of Jaen.  You will probably find that most of your students will be in daycare during their entire winter break because it's the time of the year when their parents will definitely have work (unemployment sinks to ~5% around then).  

That aside, the region really is beautiful.  If you're into nature and hiking, there are two absolutely gorgeous parks to check out.  The first is the [Parque Natural Sierra Mágina](
http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_natural_de_Sierra_M%C3%A1gina), near Bedmar.  Absolutely grogeous park in the mountains with waterfalls, streams, amazing views of the region and more.  The second is the [city of Cazorla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cazorla) which is known for its hiking trails and places to stay out in the forests, among waterfalls.

Jaen itself is a pretty cool city as well.  I don't know if you've ever been to Spain or Europe before, but much like anywhere else in Europe, everything is very close together.  You will be able to get your groceries by walking to the market, and anything else you need shouldn't require a vehicle.  I only ever took the bus when I needed to go to Carrefour (Spain's Walmart) or the movie theater, which are both out of town.  There are lots of places to go out for tapas and beer though.  The city center is usually where all the younger people will go out on weekends.  

&gt;My questions so far - Living situation - I have not found a place to live yet and plan on finding somewhere when I arrive. 

Don't.  DO NOT.  DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT.  Even if you don't get something locked down, start putting the feelers out now.  I highly recommend starting up a profile at the Erasmus sight, and getting your name and some emails out online. Contact your program and ask for other people going to Jaen.  Even if you don't find something, line up people to talk to and places to go see a few weeks out.  

I was you.  My program told me that it was easy enough to just drop off in town and find a place.  I spent the first few days in Jaen, wandering the streets trying not to cry while living out of a hotel.  I called every posting on the street and was hung up on about 30 times because my accent indicated I was a foreigner.  It was really really hard and frustrating.  I do not recommend it.

&gt;I have been advised to look into living in La Carolina and Linares but am interested in trying to live in Jaén capital. Does anyone have personal experience trying this commute? I would ideally like to carpool with another teacher but am trying to get as much info as possible. 

I didn't do that commute exactly...but my commute was the same distance.  Almost all the people I knew living in Jaen had commutes that were at least 20 minutes in the bus.  Talk to your teachers about it though.  The biggest factor is going to be if they're okay with you getting there late.  We got in 15-20 minutes late everyday which our director was cool with (actually he insisted that we spent the first hour drinking coffee), but see how lenient your school will be with the transportation schedule.  Most are pretty laid back because you know, it's Spain.

[Here's the bus schedule for that route](http://www.avanzabus.com/web/archivos/base/File/rutacontenido/Madrid-Jaen.pdf).  Looks like a bus leaves from Jaen at 5am getting into La Carolina at 5:55am (probably way too early), or leaving at 8am and getting in at 9:15am, which is what you would want.  Most schools in Spain start at 9, so definitely check.  That time table is EXACTLY what I had though.

EXPECT THAT COMMUTE TO COST 3-4 euros a trip.  It's doable but a chunk of income you will need to plan for.  You can buy a prepaid card at the beginning of each month to budget, which is what I did.  Of course, if you can carpool with a teacher that's great too.  

&gt;I am also wondering about different neighborhoods in Jaén, like where cool local bars/restaurants and shopping areas are.

I have used my epic google map skills to modify this map of Jaen for you.

[map](http://i.imgur.com/tEnyjiS.jpg)

**Red**:  The red in the south is the main city center area.  It's near the cathedral and center plaza.  It's where you'll find most of the bars and tapas places in the city.  Especially those frequented by younger people.  It's also where you'll find quite a bit of shopping.  The red in the south also is a neat area with lots of bars, tapas and shopping.  It's a little bit quieter, bordering a park.  But a good place to go on a night out where you don't want to get quite so crazy.  
**Green**:  Alright areas to live from my experience.  Obviously go check them out, because there are spots here and there that might be a little sketchy.  But generally they are safe and close enough to things you might want.  
**Yellow**:  Places to be cautious when considering apartments.  I lived in la valle (on the right), and while it wasn't terrible, I'm definitely happy that my apartment had locked gates outside of it.  A lot of gitanos in the area, and weird people hanging out in the parking lot.  The one to the left is an absolute NO.  Housing projects, half built housing projects that are now just abandoned buildings......I walked through the area frequently to go to my bank and it's not Detroit or anything....but you do not want to live there under any circumstance.  
**Purple**:  Bus Station.  You probably want to be somewhat close to this, especially if you end up taking the bus in to work.  Be warned that it is on a massive fuck-off hill.  If you live to the north of the station, you will be going up hill every morning (which I did, and lost 10 lb, but still).

&gt;My last question (for now) is whether or not Jaén is a bicycle friendly city, or if depending upon where I live I will even need a bicycle.

Sadly not really.  If you refer to the map, the two main streets in Jaen (Paseo de la estacion and Av de Madrid) are HUGE HILLS.  The city is literally built on a hill, so much so that there are escalators in some places so that people can get around the city.  You will be climbing.  A lot.  Everything is hill.  It's really hard to bike in most directions because of this.  I wouldn't bother with one.  

Drove me nuts at first, but you get in great shape and get used to it.

&gt;I would appreciate any advice or information anyone has about Jaén capital, La Carolina or the province of Jaén in general!

I would pick Jaen as your first choice to live if you can swing the work/commute thing.  La Carolina is really neat too, as is the surrounding area (old mining towns in the mountains).  I wouldn't live in puta Linares (as it's called by the locals :P).  It's pretty average.

Hope this helps, like I said, hit me up with anything.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt;Even more important, at least symbolically, is promoting the ideological concept of the Russkiy Mir, or Russian World, which places Moscow at the center of the Orthodox civilisation of largely Russian-speaking nations. At its core are the three eastern Slavic states, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, which Kirill I, the movement’s unofficial leader, believes must maintain spiritual and cultural unity under the Russian Orthodox Church.

&gt;This construct fulfills both domestic and international goals. On the home front, it moves beyond the broken promise of law and order that brought Mr Putin to power after the chaotic 1990s, focusing on conservative values instead. Internationally, it places Russia at the centre of a major world civilisation, cementing its role as a global power.

&gt;Home to the world’s second biggest Orthodox population and the mythological birthplace of the Russian nation, Ukraine is critical to the project’s success. The very name of Russia comes from Kyivan Rus, appropriated by the Duchy of Muscovy in the 16th century along with the spiritual heritage. “Ukraine is most important, it is the centerpiece,” says Mr Moshes.

So is this simply a shameless attempt to assert Russian dominance over Ukraine and BelaRus? Any idea why Russia would try to wrap itself in a cloak of religion and try to create a common identity via the Orthodox Church after decades of attempting to forge a common identity via an athiest government? That kind of seems odd. Does this have any traction amongst Ukranians?

&gt;Just how successful Russia’s arguments will be is another question. Many Ukrainians see this as yet another Muscovite attempt to steal parts of their culture and stamp out the rest.

How common is this view? Any Russkies or Ukranians care to comment on how this is seen from your perspective?",0,1375205325,null,0,false,0,cbdfdgs,t3_1jczj5,t1_cbdfdgs,t3_1jczj5,null,1430006286,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Of course, xenophobia is not exclusive to the Right and simply looking at the votes the Right receives (without taking into consideration the differences among these parties, for starters) can only lead to a limited vision of the current situation, but I believe it can still be a starting point.

Do I have to study pre-medicine or do I go straight to university? And how long will it take?
Medicine usually takes six years which equals twelve semester to complete including one year of practical training (semesters 11 and 12). No pre-medical study is necessary.

Laqueur: Certainly, but the European crisis is not primarily just a debt crisis. The real question is: **Does Europe, in its apathy, even want to play a role in global politics? Arthur Schopenhauer, the great philosopher of pessimism, said that it's easy to want, but that ""wanting to want"" is virtually impossible. No matter how often European values are invoked and praised, a weak will, inertia, fatigue, self-doubt and lack of self-confidence all amount to the psychological diagnosis of a weak ego.**

SPIEGEL: After the horrors of the 20th century and Germany's two attempts to secure global power, both of which failed miserably, is depression a part of the European state of mind?

Laqueur: Pharmacologists have yet to develop a drug to treat the collective depression of entire nations and generations. **Keeping a low profile is easier for most Europeans than coming up with the political will to become a major political power once again.**

SPIEGEL: It's also not as risky.

Second step, don't sign their Unterlassungserklärung. It's the document that says that you promise to stop sharing the movie/mp3 and never will do it again. Instead, write a modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung. Theirs is very broad, saying you'll never again share anything that might touch their copyright claims over any medium at any time forever.

Don't promise that. Instead, just promise to never share the files in mention over the medium (edonkey, bittorrent, ftp) they mention. This takes care of their Unterlassungsanspruch. Should you break your promise, you'll have to pay a high sum to them. Fax your modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung and send it per Einschreiben mit Rückschein (ask at the Postoffice).

But they want you to pay for the letter they sent you just now, too. Don't.

Don't answer anything, don't call them, don't react to anything, don't haggle. If they mean business, they'll start a Mahnverfahren. If they send you a Mahnverfahren, you dispute their claim. Now they have to prove beyond doubt to a judge that you did what they claim and lost X amount of money because of it. Which they most likely will not, because it costs money. If they do, you pay, and only then!

You cannot make a claim about all stop and searches, and then only use the 30% of the data which supports your argument.

Section 60 is a law used overwhelmingly by the Metropolitan police to combat knife and gun crime, which tends to occur in areas of social deprivation, where a lot of immigrants live. It may well be that that idea of saturation policing is fundamentally flawed, as we saw by the reaction in Tottenham, but it is inevitable that there will be different tactics in poor inner-city areas than there will in the rest of the country, and you will always be able to pick out statistics that illustrate that difference. These figures will vary hugely according to what population unit you use to make the comparisons- Section 60 stop and search likelihood relative to the demographics of: i) the whole country, ii) London, iii) inner-city London, iv) the actual areas where the powers are used.

Germany does not have nukes, biological or chemical weapons and is either not allowed to or has voluntarily vowed not to have those (I think it's the latter). We do participate in the US nuclear sharing agreement (German jets train to deliver US nukes, and those nukes are still in Germany, supposedly), and the French have repeatedly offered joint control over French force de frappe. Germany has politely declined. It's not very hard for an industrialized nation to obtain nukes though.

There are restrictions on former Eastern Germany. I think it's a nuke-free zone and IIRC there may be restrictions on NATO troop deployments there (a moot point with Poland's accession to NATO). 

Also Germany is, together with Japan, still subject to the U.N. enemy state clause, but that does not carry real significance. The German constitution prohibits offensive wars and, in fact, makes preparation of this a criminal offense (people have sued Schröder and Fischer over Kosovo, but to no success).

Yes, I do have something in common. Just like you - heritage.

So, no. I might not want that I'm just pointing on double standards when you define Roman heritage.

Believe me someone can dig up claims of some parts of Italy belong to Croatia in some books. However this proves that you are biased nationalist.

I went to Italy with a vegetarian and I don't remember her having too many problems. Yes, a lot of Italian pasta dishes are served with meat but you'll probably be fine. Especially in Rome where they tend to cater more to tourists, they should have vegetarian options. 

I would also consider staying at a B&amp;B instead of a nice hotel. It's just as safe, you get to meet the owners who are usually very nice, and breakfast is usually included in the price of the room. So you get a nice start to the day!

From Florence you have several options of day trips or stop-overs (Pisa, Siena, Assissi, Cortona). In Florence, Rome, Cinque Terre, and most other cities you are going to find youth hostels that fit well within your budget. Unless you are really wanting to go to Naples, I wouldn't. Florence is a beautiful alternative.

Personally, I wouldn't rent a car. The added expense of renting it plus the stress of finding a place to park it in the city (especially if you stay at youth hostels) isn't worth it. Trains are much easier to navigate with and are very inexpensive in getting you one place to another.

As for food, I never had an issue being a vegetarian in Italy. I lived there for almost a year and it was extremely easy to shop vegetarian, and probably easier at restaurants to order vegetarian than it can be in the states. At restaurants, I usually picked something from the pasta section since usually they are meat-free dishes, but my favorite cheap meal while traveling was going to the market or grocery and getting bread, cheese, olives, some fruit, and whatever else looked good and making a good meal (or two) out of that.

However places like Ireland and Switzerland have to deal with the shame of standing by and watching whilst Nazi Germany committed atrocities. France and Poland have to deal with the shame of standing up to the Nazis and being defeated horribly. And then there's the Italians, Germans and Austrians who have the most to be shameful for.

Ok, before someone replies to this comment, we all know what you're going to say: the safety issue. You see, dear merlinspants, whenever someone brings up a topic about safety in Italy (and, more specifically, in Naples) this subreddit splits into two very different factions: those (like me) who say that you shouldn't be much worried about the city as long as you are aware of where all your things are (basically the same level of awareness you should adopt in every other big city or maybe *a little* higher) and those who say that you're going to have a bad time (people that, in my opinion, are a little too paranoic). The truth is that none of us can really answer to the question about safety in Naples because none of us has visited the city as a tourist. I assure you that, on the other hand, our city has great culture and history, breathtaking views and very passionate inhabitants to offer. Oh, and, of course nobody here can deny that Napoli can give you the best pizza you'll ever eat (yes, I'm playing THAT card!) and maybe the best food in general.

By the way, wherever you decide to go, it will helps us a lot if you come back here after your trip and tell us how your trip did go :D

Really? Hands down?! A molested kid who died in battle?!
Fuck the slave trade and dooming the whole african continent to misery up to this day, right? 
That's nothing compared to a succession crisis, I see.

&gt;Some dark moments in Portugal's History are:
The 1755 Earthquake, as a serious blow to the people and the Empire and removed Lisbon from it's European relevance;

How is a natural disaster something to be ashamed of? Did we handle it badly like hurricane Katrina? 

&gt;Spain's backstabbing has been a constant and is greatly imbued in popular culture. We like the Spanish people very much, we just don't trust their leaders intentions. I don't think we trust ours as well...
""De Espanha, nem bons ventos nem bons casamentos""
which translates as
""From Spain comes neither good winds/omens nor good unions""

That's WAY beyond the point of discussion.
Besides, do you want to know who started the whole backstabbing? 

To those interested, starting transglobal slave trade is HANDS DOWN the most shameful moment in Portugal's history followed by the colonial war, a repercussion of the first event.
Portugal's glory was accomplished thanks to 4 centuries of an estimated 12 million slaves taken from Africa and brought to Europe and the Americas.

This whole succession episode related by u/khthon is laughable compared to the real damage done by the slave trade carried out by my country in the past. Such episode resulted in 40 years of spanish rule; the slave trade's consequences are still visible everyday.

[Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne](http://www.univ-paris1.fr/) has all the programs . 

[Paris IV Sorbonne](http://www.english.paris-sorbonne.fr/) : more history, sociology and philosophy oriented.

They're all very good. They are the most well known universities in Paris.

Also Ivy league schools like [Science Po](http://www.sciencespo.fr/en) have a lot of exchange program with the US, like Columbia etc.

Otherwise, business schools, but I'm not sure that's what you want. 

You should consider apply to an international Masters program I think.

- shitloads of ancient egyptian artifacts in the second most important collection in the world after the one in Cairo - Turin

- the coexistence of a medieval fortified city (città alta) and a modern one (città bassa) - Bergamo

- italian painting and sculpture - Milan, Turin, Rome, Florence (but avoid Florence if you can, they use their poorly maintained collections only to attract and milk unsuspecting tourists)

Frankly, when you read about it, it doesn't have the same mystical or enigmatic qualities as Constantine's conversion to Christianity. Vladimir seems to have been interested in many foreign religions and even went out of his way to invite emissaries from neighboring countries to learn more. The marriage between Vladimir, and Basil's sister Anna and his eventual baptism into Orthodox Christianity grew out of Vladimir's desire for highly sought after trading rights with Constantinople. Basil II was preoccupied by military rebellions in Anatolia during the early part of his reign, so it was easy for Vladimir to extract a favorable political marriage and trading concessions from the emperor in exchange for an alliance and military assistance.

For the Byzantine's, this alliance meant an end to Kievan attacks against the Crimean settlements and raids along the Thracian coastline. He also gave Basil thousands of soldiers which would eventually form the Varangian Guard. Vladimir's conversion to Orthodox Christianity, whether sincere or calculated, was an obviously good way for him to strengthen ties with Basil.

I don't think many people supported the Nazi regime. Denmark had been staunchly anti-German since 1848, and certainly very anti-Nazi. The Danish Nazis never got any substantial amount of votes, not even at [the election during the occupation in 1943](http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folketingsvalget_1943) where they only got 2.1 % of the votes.

Should the policy of cooperation be something to be ashamed of? I don't necessarily think so. It is very easy to judge when you have the benefit of hindsight. In 1940 it seemed obvious that the Germans would win the war, so our politicians did what they could to preserve Danish institutions, culture and government, so that we would not suffer the same fate as other occupied territories.

true,TheMarvelousDream,LITH,Lithuania,"I don't think Soviet Union could've acted the same way China did. You see, the government in China killed its own people, and Soviet Union invaded and killed people in independent countries. Granted, still not recognised as sovereign independent states, but we were no longer part of the Soviet Union.  
The acts of the Red Army were immediately followed by other countries condemning Soviet Union for their actions. And I don't think they wanted an even bigger backlash. With so little people dead, Gorbachev can to this day pretend that he did not know about the RA invading the Baltics and killing civilians (and keep his Nobel peace prize award). If he acted more agressive, he risked quite a lot, since other European countries already knew what happens when one country with a big army starts occupying other countries and moving over the map in their general direction. I honestly think, that people behind January events thought we would surrender peacefully.  
I don't know how about you, but I'm not too keen on violence. If, say, Lithuanians attacked Soviet troops, and killed them, it would've been an armed conflict with a much darker outcome. In the following days, USSR officials tried the good ol' ""but they started it"" campaign, but do you think anyone believed them? If Lithuanians really attacked them, there would have been far more than only 14 people dead. Common people did not have guns, and they all knew that they risked their lives going to the television tower and other places that were attacked.  They could've stayed at home at ignored everything, acting cowardly. But they did not. How could you not admire people like that? People who stood hand in hand singing songs, who faced the whole glory of the Red Army and did not run? The TV tower was taken, and so was Radio and Television Committee building. But did people run after this? No, they gathered around the Supreme Council buiding, they built barricades, and they were still singing. My father was there. He left his pregnant wife with a 3 year old daughter at home and no one knew if he'd come back alive. My mother almost miscarried that night.

Le truc, c'est que c'est pas toi qui décides, ni les antifas. Ensuite, un mec qui représente un trouble à l'ordre public, t'appelles les flics. Faire la justice soi-même, ça amène à des trucs supers comme l'épuration... On ne peut pas défendre des gens qui agressent d'autres personnes. Je ne comprends même pas que ça vous vienne à l'esprit. Agression préméditée = mal.

&gt;Tu ne crois pas que les noirs et les maghrébins ne se sentent pas agressés par la simple présence de skinheads ?

Non. La présence de quelqu'un n'est pas une agression. Jamais. 

On n'agresse pas les clodos qui insultent tout le monde et qui chient dans le métro, on n'agresse pas (encore) les gitans qui s'installent n'importe où et utilisent l'eau et l'électricité publics... plus tout le reste. 

Et on n'agresse pas non plus les skins bac-4 avec un QI d’huître qui vont acheter des fringues. 

Les mecs ne savent même pas qui est Hitler, que veux-tu qu'ils comprennent au fascisme ? Morillo a arrêté les cours au collège, probablement sans avoir rien retenu. Et tu crois qu'il comprend quelque chose à l'idéologie nazie ou néonazie ?

Otherwise you are generating avoidable costs. This is why it is generally advisable for the respondent to at least try to engage the claimant, instead of allowing an in absentia verdict to be issued.

That is certainly true, but you shouldn't downplay the effect that the German defeat at Stalingrad had and the potential of a German defeat. 

&gt; Nazism didn't excist as a term or philosophy (I realize Nietzsche was around before that but he wasn't a nazi!!) until 1934 - Hard to be anti-nazi before it excisted.

Perhaps I could have phrased that better, but obviously I did not intend it to mean being anti-Nazi from 1848. And I have to correct you on the start of the Nazi party. The Nazi party was founded in 1920 and came to power in 1933.

While sympathy for Fascist ideologies in the 30s during the depression certainly was real, as expressed by [Kaj Munk](http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaj_Munk) for example, or in the Conservative Youth Party, these did not have an actual effect on Danish domestic politics where the voters consistently voted for democratic parties. As such the Danish Nazi party only got 16.000 votes in 1935, which wasn't enough to be represented in the Folketing. And in 1939 they got a mere 1.8 % of the votes. http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSAP

It should also be noted that the Conservative Youth Party quickly ended its flirt with Fascism. It's pro-fascist leader [Jack Westergaard](http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_G._Westergaard) was replaced by [Aksel Møller](http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksel_M%C3%B8ller), with support from [John Christmas Møller](http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Christmas_M%C3%B8ller), and the Conservative Youth Party  returned to being a strong supporter of democracy.

&gt; but anyone who says that our hands weren't dirty as fuck collectively as a country, is suffering severely from the post-rationalization effects that was formed in the following decades.

The question is: What was the alternative to getting our hands dirty?

But I certainly agree that we have tended to paint our history in WW2 in a much too rosey way.

Other cities in Veneto worth visiting are Verona and Vicenza (and the latter, together with Venice, is a must for Palladian architecture enthusiasts). An off-the-beaten-path place in Veneto I'm *really* fond of is Cittadella, a small yet exquisite medieval town - for ~5 € you can walk on its recently-restored walls for their entire length (do it by night if it's possible).

I also would drop by the wonderful Dolomites for a couple of days, but it's probably too much of a hassle for first-time Italy visitors - keep them in mind for your next holiday in Italy, maybe, if you'll like it enough to return a second time! ;)

There was certainly a strong negative opinion of many directed at the British Army, the RUC and various other agents of the British government. But I don't think it really translated into widespread support of the actions of the IRA &amp; Co.

Cette interview est une sublime campagne marketting mais qui oublie allègrement le passé xénophobe et violent de Batskin, surnom hérité dois-je le rappeler de son maniement de la batte de baseball. Alors il lui faudra beaucoup plus d'efforts et peut-être changer de pseudo pour se faire passer pour une version athlétique de Gandhi. 

&gt;Le truc, c'est que c'est pas toi qui décides, ni les antifas

L'apologie du nazisme, la haine raciale c'est interdit par la loi et ca ne vient ni de moi ni des antifas.

&gt;Ensuite, un mec qui représente un trouble à l'ordre public, t'appelles les flics. Faire la justice soi-même, ça amène à des trucs supers comme l'épuration...

D'accord sur cette partie, c'est assez rare pour être signalé

&gt;Je ne comprends même pas que ça vous vienne à l'esprit. Agression préméditée = mal.

Je le dis, c'est pas bien mais je me trouve tout aussi déstabilisé quand je me vois obligé de devoir rappeler l'équation nazi=méchant

&gt;Non. La présence de quelqu'un n'est pas une agression. Jamais. 

C'est que tu as la chance de ne pas t'être retrouvé dans cette situation. Pour avoir par exemple partagé la tribune Boulogne avec des potes noirs, je peux te dire que c'est possible. 
Se promener avec la panoplie du skinhead, c'est une agression, pas par délit d'opinion, mais parce qu'on affiche clairement un potentiel de violence et pour des raisons xénophobes. Même si la comparaison n'est pas totalement similaire, elle peut être instructive: porte un T-shirt Milosevic en Croatie, un badge Ben Laden à New-York, ou un ou une pancarte de l'IRA dans un quartier protestant à Belfast et explique aux personnes autour de toi que ce n'est pas une agression. Ensuite on en reparle.

&gt;Les mecs ne savent même pas qui est Hitler, que veux-tu qu'ils comprennent au fascisme ? Morillo a arrêté les cours au collège, probablement sans avoir rien retenu. Et tu crois qu'il comprend quelque chose à l'idéologie nazie ou néonazie ? Bah non, le mec n'a que son corps et rien d'autre, il est à la fois immigré et dans un groupe qui est opposé à l'immigration, il est agent de sécurité de temps en temps, et c'est tout ce qu'il sera, toute sa vie de merde.

Ben j'en sais rien mais toi non plus malgré tes analyses sociologiques que je trouve basées sur de pures hypothèses, et que je désapprouve évidemment. Ce qui est clair, c'est qu'Esteban Morillo s'est reconnu dans l'idéologie nazie et je ne vois pas vraiment ce qu'une connaissance superficielle (antisémitisme, race supérieure, violence) aurait de moins accablant pour lui.

&gt;Moi, j'ai 15 ans de banlieue derrière moi, des torgnoles j'en ai pris et pour rien, même pas mes fringues, même pas une clope, même pas un regard. Est-ce que je devrais agresser des gens, aller traquer des racailles car elles représentent une menace ?

Je suis sincèrement désolé que tu te soit fait embrouiller mais ces deux situations ne sont pas comparables. Les skinheads se retrouvent autour d'une idéologie, pas ceux que tu appelles les racailles. Ce qui ne signifie pas que je cautionne leurs actions, je te signifie juste que tu mets dans un même groupe des personnes qui sont idéologiquement bien moins homogènes que les skins.

&gt;une analyse sociologique te montre en 2 secondes que c'est une victime du système et pas l'autre fils de profs d'université.

Je n'appelle pas ""analyse sociologique"" la qualification hâtive de bourgeois privilégié d'un coté et de brave prolétaire de l'autre. Clément Meric aurait été prolétaire et Esteban Morillo plus privilégié, une situation qui est d'ailleurs loin d'être farfelue, j'ai d'ailleurs croisé dans ma vie des miltants gauchistes plutôt prolos et des fafs plutôt de bonne famille, mais peu importe, je ne vois pas ce que ça aurait changé, si ce n'est ton discours.

However, in order to proper learn the language, one needs to learn the rules that are used to construct sentences. In this case, [strong inflection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_adjectives#Strong_inflection) is used to provide the ""-er"" termination to ""groß"", because Tisch is a masculine noun(der Tisch).

This is a strawman. Support for Irish re-unification does not equate to support for the incidents that were taking place at that time. We can tell from voting records and opinion polls during the troubles and the way in which they started that support for Irish re-unification was higher than 1.1%.

Our first king wasn't Spanish, in the sense that Spain as a country or kingdom, or as a union of various kingdoms, didn't exist back then! You should know that the Kingdom of Portugal precedes the Kingdom of Spain. Spain derives from Hispania, which is a Roman term for the Iberian Peninsula. It was later used by the other Kingdoms. To me it gives no legitimacy to any claim Spaniards may place on Portugal. History  proves we don't want it. Too bad if some chauvinistic leader see us as a geographical error from across the border. That actually delights me. And he can spend his time drawing up maps on how to invade and subdue us in under 24 hours and recruit gullible fools to his quixotic quest.

Portugal was founded a long time before Spain and has kept it's borders, culture and language intact. Spain would probably disaggregate long before Portugal would.

I refuse being called Spanish and think the whole idea of uniting with the rest of the Peninsula is a dumb and ruinous one. History proves it. You appear to have no historic sense/memory nor a feeling of identity towards the many idiosyncrasies of our unique culture.  I also don't call myself a Sueve or a Visigoth. 

Slavery was in practice long before Portugal even existed. In the North of Europe and well in the heart of Europe. But those seem to be untouchable and beyond critique to you, perhaps because you see them as better and prefer to remain blinded by hatred towards your own. Grow out of it and change your bedroom posters. Greeks, Carthage, Romans, Gauls, Germans, etc. in the old world all practiced slavery. Celts, Vikings, Muslims also did later on. Portugal, Spain, Holland, Britain, Flanders, Berbers, Mongols, Turks, Egyptians, etc. All took part in the slave trade, which we happened to kick start. They would have done it all the same. To claim we're guiltier is ridiculous. It's not like we had better choice back then. Should we as country also stop using products of child and other kinds of abusive labor done in Asian countries? We should but good old hypocritical EU turns the blind eye. Why? Because it's pretty much an economical imperative. I can only hope it will be this subreddit's subject a few centuries from now.

I merely pointed that the Portuguese had little choice but to accept slaves as payments for dealings with African Kingdoms. Slavery was already a big problem there long before European came. Still, nothing to be proud of but also note the other nations silence towards it. But it's beyond shameful, yes. Agreed. To try and put it in today's perspective is dishonest.

true,supterfuge,IDF,Ile-de-France,"&gt;D'accord avec toi sur notre système électoral complètement décadent et antidémocratique. Par contre, Rousseau met en avant l'unité du peuple et lutte contre l'individualisme, alors que l'Europe met en avant les divisions (multiculturalisme) et favorise l'individualisme en faisant de nous des consommateurs en lieu et place de citoyens.

Je n'ai pas dit l'inverse. En l'occurrence, je dis juste que Rousseau a raison quand il dit que le modèle de système démocratique mis en place suite à la révolution française (même s'il n'évoque pas celui-ci précisemment mais celui qui est esquissé à l'époque) amène non pas à l'élection de représentants, mais à la nomination de dirigeants qui auront, de toute façon, l'occasion d'utiliser les moyens de l'État et de ses institutions pour se renforcer eux-même et se créer une légitimité (rhétorique, pas seulement matériel, quand les élus sortant vantent leur expérience comme légitimisante).

&gt;L'argument est faible. Ce n'est pas parce que c'est une construction intellectuelle que c'est voué à disparaître. La Chine n'est pas vouée à disparaître, les États-Unis ne sont pas voués à disparaître, ainsi que la Russie et beaucoup d'autres.

Le fait est que lors de la création des États (début du premier millénaire), faisant suite aux Empires précurseurs / tribus alternatives, on est dans un contexte géopolitique particulier. Les distances sont longues à parcourir, il y a peu de contacts entre les langues, peu d'échanges, et peu de personnes cultivées. Aujourd'hui, ces barrières culturelles disparaissent. Et je ne dis pas là que la seule alternative est la société culturelle américaine, évidemment. Mais qu'on arrivera, avec un bon melting polt, à une supression des différences culturelles géographiquement formées.

&gt;D'ailleurs on voit bien que le principal ennemi des oligarques, c'est la nation. Ainsi, les puissants essaient d'asseoir leur domination en détruisant les nations pour mieux asservir les peuples.

Par ce que c'était une institution déjà en place. Mais ce n'est pas du progrès ; c'est une récession intellectuelle, de retourner vers des schémas très limités.

&gt;Peux-tu détailler stp ?

Erasmus (mélange des cultures), ouverture des musées aux jeunes, aux chômeurs et aux étudiants (ouverture de la culture et du développement de l'esprit critique aux masses), subventions pour les endroits les plus pauvres pour développer l'éducation, le transport etc (ouverture des campagnes et endroits pauvres à l'extérieur), etc etc. Il n'y a pas que la société économique à prendre en compte.

&gt;Pour finir, avec un taux de fécondité de 1,57, l'Europe est un continent vieillissant et déprimé qui ne saurait être porteur d'avenir.

C'est aussi un tout petit continent. Il y a un moment où il faut arrêter de vouloir dominer la scène politique internationale, et d'y être influent, alors que l'on représente une portion **particulièrement** minoritaire de la planète. C'est la fin du rayonnement des empires coloniaux, et dans une société (planétaire) plus humaine, plus ouverte, ça ne présente pas de problème.

&gt;On ne détruit pas une nation pour construire l'Europe, on a détruit les nations pour soumettre l'Europe. D'ailleurs, le poids politique de l'Europe dans le monde est ridicule. Tout le monde se moque de nous, on n'est pas foutus de mettre en place des sanctions contre des pays qui ne respectent pas leurs engagements.

Ca, c'est lié à ce que je disais sur les systèmes démocratiques, ce n'est pas lié intrinséquement à l'Union Européenne en tant qu'alliance des États, mais pour la supression à terme de ceux-ci.

Bah non, ce n'est pas clair du tout. Il a été adhérent de 3ème voie pendant six mois.

While in Monterosso, we explored the town and went to Vernazza. Gorgeous places!

Then train to Florence. We mostly wandered around town, ate awesome food, and visited the main museums. One day we took a bike trip in the countryside. It started out at an old castle winery where we did some wine and olive oil tastings, then a couple hours of biking, then lunch, then a few more hours of biking back to the castle. So much fun!

Train to Rome. I had planned on taking a day trip to Naples to visit Pompeii, but there's just too much to see and do in Rome, so we'll do that next time. We saw the usual sites: Vatican, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Forum, Colosseum, Appian Way, Pantheon, etc.

Nachdem es mit der Show nun nicht so wirklich geklappt hatte in der Politik, sind sie nun auf die Anti-Euro und ""Wahlalternative""-Schiene gewechselt. Mit ganz neuen Anti-Demokratischen Tendenzen (siehe oben). Daher auch meine Meinung zu den Mitgliedern.

Das Programm sowie die Auftritte die die Verkündung der Partei begleitet haben sind natürlich grösstenteils mainstreamfähig. Genauso wie die geäusserten Ideen. Das was drunter steckt sieht man wenn einer der Mitglieder zu viel sagt oder wenn man sich eben anschaut mit welchen Vereinen die Leute zusammenhängen. Diese Lobbyorganisationen sind schon lange da. Wie erfolgreich sie sind ist schwer zu sagen. Immerhin haben wir eine durch neoliberale Politik verursachte Krise hinter uns und dennoch wird die Idee nicht wirklich in Frage gestellt.

Well, Iraq was an unjustified war and basically a catastrophe, so if you want to share in the guilt feel free. But Afghanistan is a different story in my opinion. The war was legal, it was justified as a response to the Talibans support for Al Qaeda, and as an aside it also had a humanitarian justification.

true,Thyrotoxic,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Really /r/Europe. I'm no fan of gypsies but walling them off and forgetting about them is not a good idea and I'm appalled it's being condoned. It wasn't long ago that another minority were walled off in a city because they weren't particularly popular (hint it was the Jews). 

Edit:Well this is interesting. As well as widespread persecution by the police and government we have segregated education.

&gt;The practice of placing Romani students in segregated schools or classes remains widespread in countries across Central and Eastern Europe. In Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, many Romani children have been channeled into all-Romani schools that offer inferior quality education and are sometimes in poor physical condition, or into segregated all-Romani or predominantly Romani classes within mixed schools. In Hungary, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, many Romani children are sent to classes for pupils with learning disabilities, regardless of whether such classes are appropriate for the children in question or not. In Bulgaria, they are also sent to so-called ""delinquent schools"", where a variety of human rights abuses take place.
