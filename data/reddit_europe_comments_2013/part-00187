Never did that myself so can't say whether that's true, but if it is, that's sad.

That's not, in a sense, anything to do with democracy, although it's a question that only makes sense in a democratic context.

As to what constitutes a demos - a demos is self-selecting, by people who feel they have sufficient in common. Where there are two or more demos in a single territory there is the possibility of separation. Where one demos is strong enough to keep the other against its wishes, you get the various separatist movements, and the means by which the stronger keep the weaker within the demos tends to reflect and be reflected by the tactics adopted by the separatists.

As to whether a smaller demos can be allowed to remove itself from partnership with the larger, the question is very similar to whether a divorce should be granted, but without the convenience of an established legal process. If the larger demos does not mind - as in Czechoslovakia - then an amicable separation is possible. Where the smaller demos can show 'unreasonable behaviour' on the part of the larger, it may win sufficient international support for separation, although it may simply win pressure on the larger demos to be nicer - buy the other demos flowers on its birthday, celebrate *its* national day etc.

I'm not saying you CAN'T secede from Spain ever, I'm saying you can't do it by using the tools the Spanish state has given you, namely the constitution or even an election process. Using those tools (referendums, plebiscits, ""official polls"", whatever...) is self-defeating because ultimately the central government has a veto on what's proper and what's not. And they won't recognise the result of that referendum, and you Catalonian separatists will get angry, and you'll cry about the unjustice of it all, and you'll take the streets with esteladas and hippie mimes and... nothing will happen at all.

Because you're old enough to know we don't live in a democracy and the Catalonian high bourgeoisie (your future masters) has no power at all to negotiate in equal terms with the Spanish government. Before you start talking about economic power, please remember that that one CIS doc that justifies the cries of ""Madrid ens roba"" is from 2005, three years before the crisis. Things have cprobably hanged a lot since then, I'm afraid.

What's going to happen is this: CiU+ERC try to do the referendum in 2014, PP plays its role and attacks it declaring it unconstitutional, the Constitutional Court agrees, ERC tries to keep forward but CiU backs down saying they need more power (mean votes) to fight back against the evil Spaniards, so Mas shows up again in a few Diadas and waves the Senyera in front of your nose (just like it happened two years ago, and the PP does in the rest of the country) and they get enough votes to keep in power for another 4 years more.

I'm not gonna get too much into it, but this stereotypical Eurotrash attitude can be hilarious at times. I was friends with this girl from Spain at one time, and although 99% of the time she was cool as hell, sometimes this attitude would pop up, and it was rather entertaining when it did because it came across as really forced and awkward. I remember one time she tried to describe the differences between Spaniards and Americans, this is what she came up with:

""You Americans are so barbaric. You see, you guys would be so quick to kill for your country in a war, but us Spaniards would never kill for Spain. However, we would proudly *die* for our country!""

Really? What the fuck? That's not even remotely true, and if it was, Spain has a terrible strategy for war. It was the epitome of a facepalm comment, where someone was willing to say anything to establish the moral high ground between America and a European country.

Anyways, most people that have that Eurotrash attitude are just being silly. They can say stupid stuff, but it is basically equivalent to anyone from X country willing to say anything about Y country to come across as superior. These people exist in every country.

Da gehen bei manchen die Alarmglocken an, in der Assoziationen wie ""Gleichmacherei"", ""Zwangsbeglückung"" und ""Stasi"" fallen. Natürlich hat die Linkspartei Altkader aus der DDR mit an Bord, aber diese gibt es ausnahmslos in allen anderen bundesweit organisierten Parteien ebenso (die Kanzlerin war ja selbst mit dabei, wenn auch nicht in leitender Position).

Diesen Umstand vor Augen erscheint die Linkspartei einigen Menschen unwählbar.

&gt;Ihr Anspruch ist ein höherer als der der anderen Parteien, nämlich ein wissenschaftlicher. Marx trat ja dafür ein, seine Lehren, auf die Die Linke sich letztlich beruft, als »wissenschaftlichen Sozialismus« zu bezeichnen.

Die Linkspartei erhebt diesen Anspruch nicht. Die Lehre von der Wissenschaftlichkeit des Marxismus wird überwiegend in der MLPD gepredigt, von der sich die Linkspartei (und umgekehrt) stark abgrenzt. Marx kommt im aktuellen Parteiprogramm der Linkspartei gar nicht mehr zu Wort.

Die Linkspartei ist keine sozialistische Partei im marxschen Sinne. Also es ist nix mit Revolution und Diktatur des Proletariats. Sie vertritt inhaltlich und strategisch eine linke Sozialdemokratie, was bedeutet: Parlamentarismus, Marktwirtschaft und soziale Reformen.

Warum also die Linkspartei nicht wählen? Ich denke, dass sie durchaus klar geht, aber sobald sie an der Regierung ist, auch nichts groß anders machen wird oder machen wird können.

There are several reason for this. First of all the sitting coalition has not actually talked about their own politics in their election campaign. They have only talked about what things will go wrong if they are not in power. Now this card has been used for so long and still hasn't worked. They seem desperate to not loose power. They also come across as arrogant, something we Norwegians hate. 

Another thing is that they seem to have some political paralysis. One year after the crushing report after 22. July the police say that nothing has changed. They even admit that if it would have happened again they would not be better prepared.

Also people see how the quality of public services doesn't reflect a rich country that Norway is. The roads are bad, the hospitals aren't as good as they should be and the schools are old and worn down just to name a few things.

I am going to vote conservative myself this election just like a lot of people i know. Things may not change, but it's worth a try.

&gt; Sentiments about Germany 200 years ago have no relevance today

I very much tried, and spend for far much time doing that, to rationally argue and not just state sentiments. That you see it as such shows how much *you* are biased. Also, I tried to show it is influencing Germany today. The concept of longue duree, just as an example, known by history, is a concept that generally shows how *much* history is influenced by structures for which 200 years are no time. That may seem like a lot, but to only treat something that happened that long ago as such, is a prejudice. A very clear example: Most of the German law (I mean the BGB) is still rooted in the law found in the first instance of the German nation. And the word *German* in the sense used now to describe a modern nation, stems from around 1812. These are at least the roots (even though the modern concept of the German nation is in a lot of aspects quite different) of the concept of a German nation, we have now. To further use my metaphor: What happens to a tree without roots? Don't the roots influence the grow of the tree and condition of it's leaves?

&gt; More violence against foreigners during a World Championship is easily explained by more opportunities and hooliganism

It's not. How should it be? Are more foreigners (which means ""more opportunities?"", I suppose?) necessary for more attacks? No as there are a lot of foreigners you find in your everyday life. Do you mean more (well, mostly:) men are gathered? I don't think attacking someone marked as an foreigner, is something which just happens naturally when some Germans are together (even though that would nicely prove my theory ;)). Hooliginasim isn't something that is necessarily connected to attacking Not-Germans neither. You see, you need a reason why there were more attacks on foreigners. Neither of your arguments explain that, in fact they depend on the assumption that attacking foreigners is somewhat a normal behaviour, something to be expected. That is an even stronger version of my theory. 

&gt; biased studies by far-left sociologists

I didn't know that any political association changes the value of an argument. Heitmeyer surely is neither far-left nor biased, his study ""Deutsche Zustände"" was appreciated by most of the intellectual (for the lack of a better word, I mean the very postive in more important magizines and newspapers) German public. It is very interesting that you see Heitmeyer as a far-left sociologists, while his concept of Gruppenbezogene Menschenfeindlichkeit, one of his main interests, is challenged by exactly those (see for example: [Gerhard Henschel: Ein Rassist bleibt ein Rassist!](http://www.freitag.de/autoren/der-freitag/ein-rassist-bleibt-ein-rassist)). Just for your information, a lot of the most important sociologists like Foucault or even Habermas were at least rooted in what whould be considerd now as ""far-left"". Even in Hegel, one of the grandfathers of sociology, you find a deep affection for the French Revolution, if you will a precursor of what is nowadays called ""far-left"". That doesn't devalue their statements.

Well, I don't suppose my arguments convince you. This is a heavily charged discussion, but I would like it still if one would try to argue rationally. ",0,1378568428,null,0,1378569051,0,cc3kywt,t3_1ln0y1,t1_cc3kywt,t1_cc3i457,null,1429558743,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

What's the real reason behind such numbers ? Flemish doesn't lead you very far, sadly. No offence, mate, it's just that it's not even exactly the same as Dutch and even if you take Flemish and Dutchy Dutch together it's not the same weight as French in the world, not even as it is in Europe.

I'm not saying French is the most important language in the world, but I guess that a Belgian French speaker will be more eager to learn English than Dutch.

You failed to do that.

Completely irrelevant for the question in this thread. While most law naturally will remain expedient, social attitudes can change completely in a much shorter time (see e.g. the question of gay marriage in the USA). And in Germany they have completely changed since WWII.

&gt; Are more foreigners (which means ""more opportunities?"", I suppose?) necessary for more attacks?

No, but it is extremely likely that more foreign short term visitors will have that effect.

Both arguments explain it. And yes, in a football setting violence against the other group, whoever they are, is normal and expected. That's the reason why there are so many cops in football stadiums and the fans are divided into seperated blocks.

All Flemish grandparents were denied to speak their language in school. After Belgium became an independent country (1830) a small French speaking elite took power and made French the only official language throughout the country.  
It wasn't until the 1960s that the Flemish populace (still a majority of the Belgium population) could reclaim their language.

The damage however has been done, a large part of Flanders now speaks French. I'm guessing you're from that part of Flanders that was annexed by France after WWI, do you speak Dutch?

The majority in Flanders would want this aswell, and thus learn both languages. The reason why this isn't enforced is because, as we see at the higher ranks of the Army for example*, demanding bilinguality for government employees gives a distinct disadvantage for French-speakers.

 * For the uninitiated: Senior French-speaking military officers complained that the highest ranks of the army were rapidly becoming a Flemish stronghold. After some investigation it turned out that the appointment for these ranks required proficiency exams for Dutch and French, and that the success rate was alot higher for Flemish than for French-speakers. This resulted in the fact that the majority (and more than proportionate) of people who qualified for being appointed were Flemish.

&gt;    ""This issue regarding economies is devoted to the demand for knowledge of languages in Belgium and in its three regions (Brussels, Flanders, Wallonia). The surveys show that Flanders is clearly more multilingual, which is without doubt a well known fact, but the difference is considerable : whereas 59% and 53% of the Flemings know French or English respectively, only 19% and 17% of the Walloons know Dutch or English. ...

&gt;Within the report, professors in economics Ginsburgh and Weber further show that of the Brussels' residents, 95% declared they can speak French, 59% Dutch, and 41% know the non-local English. Of those under the age of forty, 59% in Flanders declared that they could speak all three, along with 10% in Wallonia and 28% in Brussels. In each region, Belgium's third official language, German, is notably less known than those.

I'd probably understand it if the situation were similar to Germany. Basically, there are 2 German languages. One is High German and one is Low German. After language standardisation was a thing, the dialect Martin Luther translated the bible to was used as the Standard German in Germany. It was a High German dialect, though, so Low German pretty much felt out of use and only people in the North (and I mean close to the coast. Not just the northern half of Germany) actually speak it fluently (more and more young people learn it, though, which is kind of great). 

So it's even worse than Welsh or other old minority languages and only High German is the official language of Germany but Low German has official status in some northern states and they also offer everything the government publishes (state government, obviously) in Low German and are bound by law to respond to Low German requests in Low German.

But it would be useless to implement that on a national level because in other states, they're maybe 5 1/2 people that actually speak Low German. Even in states that were Low German before.

But if there are such big groups as in Canada or Belgium, there has to be some balance.

That led to the creation of the ugliest city ever built, thanks.

And also, don't tell me that riotting against people and asking them to get the fuck out is really nice.

&gt; Now that Flanders is the big moneymaker there is less of initiative of the French part to come and work in Flanders. 

Why would anyone go into a region where everybody hates him to live a life of insults and denigration ?

&gt; And against you, you are the reason why the Flanders part doesn't like French people

Oh, you're true here, it's not limited to Walloons, French people are also really hated in Flanders, see the next part.

&gt; When I travel to a French city, I try my best to speak French. When someone from Wallonia comes to a Dutch city, they demand to be treated in French

I often go to Flanders, because as I said it earlier, I really love the region and architecture. I also learnt a few Dutch words (Netherlands Dutch, sorry) and I try to use them as much as I can. And I'm French, remember, I'm not Belgian, I didn't have Dutch lesson in school and didn't have any other reason than the interest for the language to learn it.

It's worthless. You sip a word of French and the behaviour towards you changes completely. No matter you're a feggin' tourist who comes to spend his French money or an established Walloon or Brusseler ennemy. 

Now, an example, that happened to me, in Mechelen. This is a very beautiful town but after a walk with some friends, I have a little hunger and see a bakery. I go in, say a perfect ""Goeden dag !"" and the woman is all smiles until I stupidly ask her ""Spreekt U Frans ?"". Her face changed completely and I really had a hard time ordering something she wasn't really eager to serve me. I mean, is it even forbidden to ask ? is it so hard to keep smiling and politely say ""Nee, sorry, meneer"" ? Do I need to get a flag which says ""I'm not an unemployed Walloon, I'm French"" to get a slight amount of respect ?

I have many stories like that because despite this kind of encountered people, I can't count how many times I went there and I still continue and will still go even if you finally get your independance. (Well, if you build a wall from Dunkerque to Maastricht, I might reconsider (No, I know it could happen, many other limits have been exceeded already)).

Taking issue with Habermas’ interpretation of the philosopher Immanuel Kant, he argues that the creation of a supranational democracy is not only unlikely, but conceptually flawed. Rather than viewing a voluntary association of independent states as being fundamentally weak or incomplete without further integration, we should recognise that it offers the best of all worlds: preserving European diversity, while also increasing tolerance and safeguarding against war.*

It's known with certainty that for years Berlusconi hosted Vittorio Mangano, a mafia boss, in his personal villa, under the guise of a stable master, most likely so that Mangano would provide protection to Berlusconi and his family.

What this trial does is establish once and for all that Dell'Utri did indeed deal with the mafia *on behalf of Berlusconi* (a detail which hadn't been proven before).

Italians have known the facts above for close to two decades know. They've voted for him regardless, because he owns the media, buys out opponents and has faced some of the weakest, most disorganized political opposition in the history of the country. 

Some people buy into his narrative that all accusations against him are false, slander crafted by leftist judges to stop the liberal revolution he's supposed to be bringing. Others are not as naive, but see their interests align with business-friendly Berlusconi more than anyone else.

I notice nobody has answered you in two hours, so I'd like to help if you want.

From the Wikipedia page (http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcidosso) I gather it's a small village in the Apennine mountains near Grosseto, so to address some of your questions: you should pack heavy clothes, and expect some snow during your stay, too.

I would not expect to find too much action/social places to go to, it being a small village of about 4000 people.

I don't think you'll face any of the dangers typical to bigger urban areas or metropolis, I expect you'll be the object of some mostly harmless and genuine curiosity, though :-)

Google maps could help you plan the trip from Pisa to Grosseto and then to Arcidosso but be prepared to change from train to bus, and it'll take you a good chunk of a day to get there.

Das DDR-Schreckgespenst ist für mich allerdings sehr real. Stell dir vor, du würdest 1959 eine rechtsradikale Partei haben, die über ein paar Ecken zu kleinen Teilen aus der NSDAP hervorgegangen ist. Die ist nicht wählbar. Ich will jetzt gar nicht abstreiten, dass die Nazis schlimmer waren als die DDR, aber die DDR war eine Diktatur, in der Oppositionelle in gruseligen Folterknästen eingesperrt wurden oder wo zB nur Parteimitglieder eine Möglichkeit zur höheren Bildung hatten. Ein ""Wir sind die guten Sozialisten, Ehrenwort!"" reicht nicht, da muss echte Vergangenheitsbewältigung passieren. Überhaupt wurde der Sozialismus ja weltweit unendlich oft von Diktatoren gebraucht (missbraucht) - die Frage, ob da nicht solche Probleme systemimmanent sind, scheint mir zumindest ganz interessant.

true,wbxs,null,null,"&gt;Solange man in der Opposition ist kann man halt ordentlich auf die Pauke hauen - und das war im Parlamentarismus schon immer so.

Genau. Koalieren hingegen heißt auch, verlässlich Kompromisse eingehen zu können, was in der Regel bei den Mitgliedern (und auch Wählern) der Koalitionspartner nicht gut ankommt. In der Opposition lässt es sich befreiter auf die Pauke hauen, es ist ja auch weniger Verantwortung damit verbunden. Koalitionen bestehen oft aus den Parteien mit der größten 'Schnittmenge' an Themen und Überzeugungen, was sich bei der Linken am ehesten mit Rot-Grün deckt, doch auch hier wären Kompromisse notwendig. Und wenn mann bedenkt, dass Linken &lt;- SPD/Grüne &lt;- CDU/FDP in politischer Richtung sind, und die Linke wohl kleinster Koalitionspartner wäre, müsste die Partei viele Kompromisse machen.

Meiner Meinung nach hat Steinbrück dies im TV-Duell schön zusammengefasst: Bei der Linken gibt es die ostdeutschen Linken, die auch auf Landesebene schon Regierungsverantwortung übernommen haben; die westdeutschen Linken (viele aus der WASG), die hauptsächlich Oppositionsarbeit machen und ideologisch sehr stark sind; und die kommunistische Plattform. Kompromisse nur schwer verkraften würden davon die kommunistische Plattform (was ist sonst ihr Ziel?) und die ideologisch starke Seite (da die Unterschiede z.B. zur SPD hauptsächlich in der Größe der Änderungen wie Mindestlohn oder Mindestrente liegen.)

In diesem Sinne wäre es schwer für die Linke, ihre Ziele bei Koalitionspartnern, sowie Kompromisse bei den eigenen Mitgliedern, durchzusetzen. Es kann gar nicht im Interesse der Linken liegen, in einer Koalition große Kompromisse zu machen, sonst würden sich ihre Wähler neue Lager suchen, dafür sind die Unterschiede zu anderen Parteien zu gering.

Wenn die Unterschiede so gering sind, warum dann keine Rot-Rot-Grüne Koalition auf Bundesebene? Rot-Grün will keinen Partner, der evtl keine interne Mehrheit für unbequeme Entscheidungen hat und dadurch die Handlungsfähigkeit der Koalition gefährdet - dafür ist die Linke intern zu sehr gespalten. Die Linke hingegen fürchtet, als Juniorpartner in einer Koalition zu viele Kompromisse zu machen (müssen) und dadurch viele ihrer Wähler zu verlieren.

Damit eine Stimme für die Linke nicht eine verschenkte Stimme für einen Regierungs-/Politikwechsel ist, müsste die Linke massiv an Stimmen dazugewinnen (~20% Wahlergegnis), damit sie entweder als starke Opposition eine gewählte Regierung in die Schranken weisen kann und so zu einer besseren Politik bewegt (funktioniert selten), oder damit sie sich in einer Koalition auch wirklich durchsetzen kann. Oder sie müsste sich intern einigen und kompromissbereit werden um zu großem Teil ein Programm einer anderen Partei zu unterstützen.

There you have coaches (the bus company is called Rama)

Here is a timetable: http://www.ramamobilita.it/~linee_orari/orari/pdf/Q_8.pdf

It's rather hilly (670 meters) and surrouned by mounts so it'll be cold while the winter approaches.

I don't know where you are coming from, but yes, expect it to be quite remote.

It's near Monte Amiata ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Amiata ).

Arcidosso was in XIX century home of Davide Lazzaretti, a prophet claiming to be a ""second christ"" and fighting for a social and religious reform. 

His religious hymns, with phrases like ""Repubblica e Libertà"", were not exactly welcome in the new-born Kingdom of Italy, who had just finished conquering the Pontiff States, and feared BOTH a revolution backed by religious motives and a revolution of social(ist) nature.

During a procession  in 1878, he was killed by the Carabinieri (Police).

There's very little about him in english, see for example: http://web.archive.org/web/20120106220605/http://www.italiannotebook.com/local-interest/lazzaretti-outlaw-prophet/

The remains of is church on Monte Labbro are still extant, and there is a small and quite elusive group of people still believing in him or anyway revering him, mainly in Arcidosso and Santa Fiora.

And the area must indeed be rather inspiring for the religious: in Arcidosso you can find the Dzogchen Center of Merigar, the largest center of Tibetan Buddhism in Italy ( http://www.dzogchen.it/ )

So, do not expect your stay in Arcidosso to be very full of events, but if you are the kind of person that likes to ""feel"" the spirit of a place it might definitely get interesting.

Those are the numbers for Brussels and this is the reason the Flemish people often don't want it because they know slowly but surely French will take over and there's still a strong residue left from the old movement that was indeed anti French. Guess why? Because the entire countries elite at the time was French. If you joined the army your orders would be given to you in French and French only which lead to the known phrase of the Flemish movement after the world war ""Here our blood, when our right?"". People had to get certain educations in French because they couldn't get them in Dutch in Flemish universities which (among other reasons) lead to things like ""Leuven Vlaams"".

French always was a bigger language then Dutch and as such there was/is less reason for the French side to adapt and learn Dutch which doesn't go the same for the Dutch side which shows clearly as 59% of the Flemings know French, but only 19% of Francophones know Dutch.

It is also used on the coat of arms of Spain, the coat of arms of Pyrénées-Orientales and of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, the flag of Roussillon, Capcir, Vallespir and Provence in France, one quarter of the coat of arms of Andorra, and on the local flags of many municipalities belonging to these territories.

I once was with a Friend in ~~Anvers~~ Antwerpen and after a nice walk in this beautiful city (and I mean it, as I said, it's my effing pleasure to look at Flemish architecture) we decide to have a Belgian delicacy in a bar, aka, a beer.

We're obviously talking French to each others, my friend not speaking a single word of Dutch (once again, remember we're French, nothing would lead us to speak Dutch). The waiter comes and talk to us in Dutch, weirdly, I answer him in English because I sadly didn't understand what he said (accent, fast speaking, noise in the bar) and he tells me he doesn't speak English. So I try to order in Dutch, as good as I can and I think I did pretty well, I even show him the menu so he can see precisely what we want.

Yeah, you see it coming. He served us totally different beers, in 25cl instead of 50 as ordered and when I tried to tell him there was a mistake I was quickly short out of vocabular to make myself clear. I dunno if his mistake was on purpose or if it wasn't, but the guy didn't even try.

Just to clarify, This kind of story happens only once every three trips I have there and I'll just give 5 stars to Leuven (my personnal favorite building being there) for never having met an ass in this town (despite the lil tensions there used to be there).

&gt; there is this sentiment in Flanders of the French speaking community slipping further and further into Flanders.

I really wonder where this sentiment does come from, the language wall seems to have been steady for a while now, and the kind of measures taken isn't preventing any move, it just pisses off lotsa people who've been  there for years and surely consider themselves as Flemish and will have to move in another region or country because they're not well considered by their own brothers.

Languages are there to facilitate communication and it is bizarre that the government would actually restrict people from communicating in a certain way, no matter where or how. I know understand that Menen is completely in the *legally* to do this, and that they are even morally in the right to not be obligated to speak to people in French, but actually going full circle and banning communication in French?

CDU: is the party of the standstill. We had 16 years of standstill under Kohl and now Merkel is trying to beat his record.
 They are conservativ and you would expect them to be able to make social reforms and to sort out subsidies but in the end they tend to do nothing. The problem is that many CDU voters are retirees and elder people who have conservative values but are left leaning when it comes to social politics This leads to the strangest ideas(like the Betreuungsgeld)


SPD: is the party of the pragmatists. They are traditionally on the left wing but they are not afraid to make hard decisions and for that they are wiling to leave their principles behind. They introduced the Agenda 2010 despite losing many of their loyal voters  and splitting the party in half. However this reforms left them weakened and now they are lacking a clear directions. They are still trying to find themselves and do not seem to be that interested in leading right now. Right now they are ven struggling to build up an opposition against the CDU.

FDP: is the party of the opportunists. A FDP politician will sell you and his ideals out for his own personal gain (yes I know so does every politician but the FDP has brought this concept to the extreme). However there are few exceptions ( mainly Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger). 

Greens: Greens are left wing. However Green party voters have the highest average income of all voters. So the green party is pretty much the party of wealthy people with a bad conscience. They like to pretend to be left wing because it makes them feel better but in the end they are out of touch with the problems the lower classes.

To the question: ""why do Chris and Aline disappear?"" he answers that *the film tells the story of a young man growing up.

But his project, what really drives him, remains music. And it's with Miao-Lin that he really accomplishes himself, natural since she's a musician woman.*

You call their business practice illegal when it isn't, it may not be according to your moral standards but why would they adhere to them?

Think about business practice once more, dude.

Now Jewish people who have been hated because they have killed Jesus (despite him being a Jew himself). The Catholic church has some major league relevance here, and you should know how they exerted power to ban Jews from regular jobs. They forced them into fields like money lenders which was seen as un-Christian. Economy and Trade is a centuries-old practice Jewish people have developed in order to survive. They stuck to themselves because they couldn't expect protection from the ""Christian"" nobility under Papal influence, even left icon Karl Marx, being Jewish on his own, only condemned their role in economy and negleting all reasons. This culminated in those disastrous events we all know about, and where every major power had their hands dirty.

Premetto che mi faccio 100 Km al giorno, a tutte le ore del giorno e della notte...
Io faccio i 120 fissi, anche perche' di piu' con la mia carretta sarebbe impossibile, ma mi e' capitato piu' di una volta di essere praticamente con il muso poco piu' avanti del ""sedere"" di un camion (o del secondo rimorchio), e questo a piantato la freccia e si e' messo a sorpassare.

Lo specchietto ce l'ha, lo sa che sono li, e' che evidentemente non gli interessa.

E se non lo schivi al volo, cambiando corsia, ti suona. Non e' cosi' pericoloso ma quantomeno rompe i maroni.

&gt; Quando c'è una salita, i camion scarichi e/o potenti vanno molto più forte di quelli carichi e/o poco potenti. Chi è più veloce ha voglia, e tutto il diritto, di passare chi gli sta davanti. In piano, il discorso è simile: chi va un po' piano del limite, anche di 1-2km/h, viene passato da tutti quelli ne vanno alla velocità ""giusta"". Il camionista scorretto, per così dire, è quello che va piano ma non abbastanza da farsi passare agevolmente, non quello che lo passa.

Grazie!

Da automobilista, i punti sono due:

* 15-20 minuti a viaggio fanno 40 minuti totali al giorno. Per un viaggio diciamo di 1 ora o 1 ora e 15. 40 minuti regalati all'azienda e rubati alla mia vita, fondamentalmente. Moltiplicali per 5 o 6 giorni a settimana per quanto, 5 o 10 anni, e fanno parecchio la differenza

* Io devo timbrare il cartellino. Parto sempre con un certo anticipo ma a volte, perche' magari ero in palestra, magari ero dal dentista, magari ero a fare la spesa, parto al pelo. Credo sia normale. E comunque preferisco passare piu' tempo in ufficio che piu' tempo per strada, quindi cerco di accorciare il viaggio il piu' possibile.

* Se non mi cambiassero niente 40 minuti in piu' al giorno, a questo punto farei la strada normale e risparmierei quei 100-150 euro di pedaggio al mese.

* In prima corsia dietro ai camion non ci puoi stare, perche' poi ti trovi schiacciato tra 2 camion e non e' il massimo. In terza non ci sto quasi mai, perche' se sto ai 140 mi sembra di decollare, pero' poi la seconda me la bloccano ogni 2 minuti.

Loro di lavoro guidano. Non e' ""tempo rubato"", e' il loro lavoro. E' una po' una merda ma ce ne sono di peggiori.

Volevo capire dal punto di vista lavorativo quanto guadagnavano a sorpassarsi di continuo.

I'm curious---how do they do it in Switzerland? It seemed to me when I was there that in some regions they only speak German, in others French. They seem to have the same type of problem as Belgium..I mean, I think in one part of the country they speak French, in another German. I wonder how the cantons there handle it when a french speaking person from Geneva, for example, moves to Zurich?

Anyway, here is maybe a solution...tax people higher when buying property if they don't speak the language of that region.

So if the normal tax is 10% when you buy a property, if you don't speak the language of the region where that property is, then have those people pay a higher tax, of maybe 25%. I think this might work as a better incentive to get people to know the language of the other region. Well, that's my opinion at least. Also, since you paid that higher tax, now the people in the commune (is that what is called?) can speak to you in your native language since you paid the price for moving there. 

Also, kids learn languages much easier---I don't understand why in Belgium they don't just simply teach both languages in 1st, 2nd, 3rd grade when it is easier for humans to learn languages. Also, at that age, kids basically learn a language through playing and as long as they are playing, they don't care what language they speak. In other words, make it fun for the kids to learn the language, and not just another grade based class.

I know because my nephews speak 3 languages and they are 9 years old and they learned their other languages while in 1st grade, 2nd and third grade. Yes, they are not going to go out and give a speech in those other languages, but if somebody spoke to them in spanish, french or english (native language), they sound like natives in the other 2.

So as they get older, if they want to pursue those languages at a deeper level, it will be easy for them, but they have the base and they have the pronunciation right and the structure right.

But yea, if you give them the choice at a much later age, not as easy and kids then are not as interested. 

So maybe the other approach is to simply just immerse the Belgian kids in both languages at an earlier age at school. Or even better, maybe give tax incentives to parents who have their kids learn the other language proficiently.

Also, when visiting Europe, I think in Belgium, there are many subsidized language schools for adults. I know my friend there was learning chinese (of all languages) and it was cheap. Maybe 100 euros for a lesson of 8-9 weeks, and unlike in the USA, they were real language courses where you got to speak. Not just grammar shit as you have in the USA. 

So in a way, I agree with you...you live in Belgium and you don't speak the other language, then shame on you. Is not like you have to pay thousands of euros to learn the other one. But indeed, at the same time, the government needs to find a better solution to instill the languages cause is a shame. Dutch gives you the ability to learn german, english, while french opens you to italian, spanish, portuguese, romanian, etc. Yet Belgians, are not really seizing this opportunity which to me is just crazy. :D

The UK is definitely not Germany, I know, but my comments were based on my experiences here. I strongly believe that if a government is going to decide that you don't work ""enough"" it's their responsibility to give you the chance to do so, first and foremost.

&gt; Nothing is too hard for people who do not have to do it.

I'm not sure what you're saying here. It's not too hard for people to find a job when the government allows them to live on welfare indefinitely? The categorisation wouldn't be too hard if it didn't have to happen?

&gt; Well, I think you're wrong[...]

And that's why I think that these policies have to be implemented well, which is what I have been saying all along. It is society's duty to support those of us who can't make it. But is it also our duty to support those who can and choose not to, because they know we will support them? I would not agree with this. Instead, it is our responsibility to give tools to make it on their own to those who aren't, regardless of whether it's a choice or not. If they don't choose to use those tools, I don't see a problem with also not supporting them.

You see, the philosophy of welfare here, which I think is a great one, is that it's a trade between society and citizen. Society has a duty to support the citizen, and in return the citizen has a duty to offer themselves to the work market or in some way work for the common good of society in whatever ways they can. In the case being discussed here, assuming correct categorisation, which should be perfectly doable, the trade is not being fulfilled. Remember, there are six other categories, and we don't know what all of them are.

And, in the end, perhaps you are right that in practise this would never work in the UK. Why that would be, I have no idea; I'm not an experienced citizen of that nation.

E' dura rispondere senza poter guardare nella testa dei genitori che hanno ritirato i bambini dalla classe. Voler giudicare a distanza le motivazioni altrui e' voler proiettare su altri i propri pregiudizi - e non e' tanto distante dal 'bigottismo' di cui vengono accusati i genitori.

Pero', io posso parlare per me stesso; non avrei problemi a mandare i figli in una classe mista e multiculturale (Americani, Scandinavi, Nordafricani, Centro-africani, asiatici), e penso anzi che questa sarebbe per loro un'occasione di crescita (e di fatto finira' cosi' visto che cambio paese ogni pochi anni).

Avrei di sicuro grosse perplessita' invece se il 70% della classe appartenesse in blocco ad un'unica etnia (o cultura) con gravi problemi di integrazione; e l'errore sarebbe secondo me quello fatto dalle autorita' scolastiche, che dovrebbero cercare di 'distribuire' queste concentrazioni per evitare che una singola classe o una singola scuola siano troppo sbilanciate.

Ich vermute, für die AfD ist es mittlerweie auch schon zu spät.

A week of notable business aquisitions.

* Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft. Thousands of Nokia employees in Finland have been worried over the future of their jobs. Steve Ballmer and Stephen Elop have reassured that Finland will be ""the centre of all phone development at Microsoft"" and that there are no plans to move units from Finland.  

 Former Nokia CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo commented on the deal yesterday in a pretty open interview: [Ex-Nokia boss: Company became ""complacent""](http://yle.fi/uutiset/ex-nokia_boss_company_became_complacent/6819661)  

 Even former Nokia CEO Jorma Ollila has so far declined to comment saying it'll have to wait until his book is published next month.  

 Meanwhile Nokia's share value rose from the earlier rock bottom, and company's credit rating improved from the earlier trash.

* Finnish design icon Artek (e.g. Alvar Aalto furniture) was [bought by a Swiss furniture company Vitra](http://yle.fi/uutiset/swiss_design_firm_snaps_up_artek/6818192). Artek was previously owned by a Swedish investement company Proventus. Family-owned Vitra is known for its design furniture worldwide so the deal is likely good news for Artek.

* Also mobile broadband (4G LTE) company Renesas Mobile will change ownership. American Broadcom will buy it from Japanese Renesas Electronics, which had earlier bought it from Nokia. The employees worked very hard to get the deal as the operations were facing a shutdown: [Renesas Mobile saved from shutdown as US giant snaps it up](http://yle.fi/uutiset/renesas_mobile_saved_from_shutdown_as_us_giant_snaps_it_up/6815057)

Also a week of nuclear news.

* Finland's 6th nuclear power plant which will be built by Finnish energy consortium Fennovoima will likely have a Russian AES-2006 pressurised water reactor from the Russian state nuclear company Rosatom: [Fennovoima taps Russian supplier for nuke project](http://yle.fi/uutiset/fennovoima_taps_russian_supplier_for_nuke_project/6812319)

* In other news Finland's largest energy company Fortum has made a partnership deal with British Rolls-Royce and Rosatom to develop nuclear power technology, and to study the suitability of Rosatom's PWR in the UK: [Fortum inks nuclear, wind power deals with UK firms](http://yle.fi/uutiset/fortum_inks_nuclear_wind_power_deals_with_uk_firms/6817040)

* Finland's first nuclear reactor will be decommissioned in the near future. The research reactor in Otaniemi polytechnic was first started in 1962 and has been used for research, training, isotope production and advanced cancer treatments but there's no funding to continue its operation. Spent fuel will likely be shipped back to the US where the reactor originates.

Oh yeah, the economy.

* The economy is growing but slowly at 0.2% compared to first quarter: [Statistics: Finland slow to return to growth](http://yle.fi/uutiset/statistics_finland_slow_to_return_to_growth/6815650)

* The government sold some of its shares of telecom TeliaSonera and bagged about €360 million which will be spent on investments in infrastucture and ""skills development projects"". 

* Economists estimate that the very moderate pay rise deal reached last week will give some extra boost to growth, and would create even up to 20000 jobs in Finland within the next two years. But as always not everybody is as optimistic and estimates are all over the place between 5000 and 24,000: [Zero level pay rises could spur employment](http://yle.fi/uutiset/zero_level_pay_rises_could_spur_employment/6819136)

* The World Economic Forum ranked Finland #3 in the world in its competitiveness ranking: [Finland still riding high in competitiveness ranking](http://yle.fi/uutiset/finland_still_riding_high_in_competitiveness_ranking/6813426)

And other news.

* There has been a long controversy over the procedures when the PM commissioned a €700,000 report about Finland's long term future from philosopher Pekka Himanen without having a public tender. [Was not good governance](http://yle.fi/uutiset/chancellor_of_justice_govts_700000-euro_order_not_good_governance/6817503) said the Chancellor of Justice on friday.

* Ruins of the first known church in Finland likely from the 12th century were found near the former capital Turku: [Finland’s oldest church discovered near Turku](http://yle.fi/uutiset/finlands_oldest_church_discovered_near_turku/6813503)

* Finnish football fans had a rare treat as the world's best football team Spain paid a visit to our football periferia. In a good spirited game Spain won 2-0 but Huuhkajat had their moments.

* Finland has done surprisingly well in the Eurobasket 2013 in Slovenia. Finland's Susijengi won the games against Turkey (de-fence!) and Sweden, but yesterday lost to Italia. Will be interesting game today against the erratic Russia.

* Hunting season has begun, so far 21 bears down from a quota of 132.

* Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute opened a new web-service where the public can track the positions of wolves equipped with radio-collars: http://pantaseuranta.rktl.fi/

In the NW the environment is a lot more ""central european"" than in the south, where the lifestyle is dramatically different and a lot more mediterranean. People are generally less sociable but the population density is through the roof so it balances out. The climate is pretty cold and wet and everyone is always busy.

In the south, people are chill. Shops and restaurants open and close very late and everyone strives to enjoy life more than getting busy. It can get very hot in the summer, and everything seems to move slower.

Thing is, most of the beautiful places in the North (Lago di Garda, Lago Maggiore, Dolomiti, mountains in general) are scarcely populated. The places where you can find the most people - Milan and Turin - are incredibly beautiful cities but lifestyle there can get very dull and depressing fast, depending on your attitude.

Probabilmente mi darebbe un po' fastidio - ma solo un poco, perche' i tre paesi che hai citato non sono veramente molto omogenei (soprattutto la Finlandia, che peraltro e' spettacolare).

Ma a leggere la tua domanda mi chiedo se hai letto l'articolo:

&gt; Vedi che anche tu dai per scontato che questi ragazzini facciano tutti uniformemente parte di una cultura problematica e vengano da famiglie con problemi di integrazione, solo perché sono africani?

Secondo l'articolo in maggioranza sono immigrati marocchini. Se veramente fossero il 70% della classe, devo dire che qualche problemino me lo porrei; perche' di fatto sappiamo entrambi che in classe i bambini finirebbero a parlare fra loro solo l'arabo, e invece di una classe multiculturale finiremmo con una divisione netta fra marocchini e italiani.

Un'altra cosa: strano ma vero, ho vissuto un bel po' in Africa. Non e' tanto il continente che mi preoccupa, quanto le difficolta' di integrazione che (come ho potuto toccare con mano) affliggono piu' di altre le comunita' di immigrati dal Marocco. Difficolta' che non ho visto con altre comunita', come (per dire) quelle Senegalesi, Sud-Africane o Ghanesi - e perfino Tunisine, regione molto vicina al marocco ma dal carattere molto diverso. 

In sostanza, non so esattamente (come non lo sai tu) quale sia la situazione a Bolzano, ma non mi sento proprio di mettermi a strillare 'al razzista' a priori - anche se fa molto *politicamete corretto*. 

Se ci sono problemi, dovrebbero forse essere affrontati, invece di far finta che non esistano.

I get that fossil energy sources are dangerous too. We should get away from both. 

The thing is that power plants are run by private companies for a profit. It is in their interest to maximize that profit, and they do that by keeping the running cost low. I don't trust these companies to keep the security measures the should. We had countless incidents in Germany where the big operators of nuclear power plants violated regulations. The oil spill in the gulf of mexico is just another example that these companies can not be trusted to do everything they can to prevent dramatic failures.

But there are no working commercial thorium reactors, so for now nuclear = uranium.

&gt;The Fukushima disaster happened because the plant was struck by both a tsunami and an earthquake while safety problems were ignored(which I think was also the problem with Chernobyl).

You can't take out the human factor of plant management. There will always be humans involved, and it will always be cheaper to cut corners on safety, and it will never appear to be a problem until it's too late.

&gt;Aside from all that, nuclear energy generates a ridiculously large amount of energy compared to coal, oil, solar, and wind.

I think in Germany there are special reasons for why people feel more strongly about privacy than elsewhere. First of all there was the 3rd reich, where you'd get gassed if the state found out you were someone they didn't like. Then came the Stasi, which would put you in jail / torture you if it found out that you were bad-mouthing the government (or ""worse""). Or if someone working for the Stasi decided to make up some evidence against you.

Of course, ignoring that last part, it was okay as long as you didn't have anything to hide, right? If you were a die-hard communist convinced that the party's always right - you didn't have to hide that from anyone. If you were sufficiently ""aryan"", didn't have any jewish / left-leaning / intellectual friends or family, you didn't have anything to hide either under the Nazi rule.

I think this is tough to explain to someone who's simply comfortable with how things are for them right now, but I think the ""complicated"" answer is that you never know when you'll suddenly find yourself having something to hide.

true,[deleted],null,null,"""What about the nuclear power plant 70 kilometers away from Munich?""

Actually the Chernobil zone is only a 30 km radius around the reactor. If the most devastating event ever to happen to a reactor occours, it will be still 40 km away from Munich. And this is a worst-case scenario, which has only happened twice in ~50 years by operating countless reactors worldwide. 

""We don't have 2600 square kilometers to spare in Germany.""

Actually you have three times as much natural reserves in Germany, increasing the area of Naturschutzgebiete by 37% does not sound so severe to me.

""People are living here and have been for centuries.""

Actually people have been living in Syria just as long, however climate change are forcing them to leave that country, or kill enough of them to reduce population to adequate levels for the new rain-free climate of the country. And this will be more severe and will affect many more countries.  I fail to see, how reactor accidents, which are only a rare event and can be avoided by following safety protocols, and if they happen only affect a few thousand people are more horrible than climate change, affecting literally billions, destroying their sole income. So to make the question interesting, which one do you think is more dangerous, a few thousand germans living in a 0,0001% chance of slightly elevated risk of cancer, or a few billion third world inhabitants starwing to death with 100% chance?

""I am not willing to take any chances with that, however small they might be.""

Yet you walk on the streets, drive your car, fly a plane, despite the many-many deaths due to traffic accidents each year. Simply leaving your house is more dangerous than operating a nuclear reactor, however you are not afraid to cross the street. Why is that? Small chances do not bother you?

""I get that fossil energy sources are dangerous too. We should get away from both. ""

And generate electricity using what? In Europe we burn coal to substitute nuclear power, actually, coal consumpsion is on the rise. There are no signs of alternative power plants on the continents, only fossil fuels.

Is die partij consequent links en heeft ze een socialistische/marxistische ideologische grondslag? Absoluut.

Dan heb ik het over partijen zoals de sp.a en Groen.
De enige absolute definitie van extreemlinks die ik ooit heb kunnen vinden spreekt van de maatschappij te willen veranderen met niet democratische middelen. Bij de PVDA is dat allerminst het geval. Het tegendeel is zelfs waar daar de partij vaak van gebrek aan democratie een strijdpunt maakt.

Als de stemtest zegt dat je mening vaak overeenkomt met die partij zou ik ze zeker eens nader bekijken.

Send them your application even if you don't find a job offer on their website. You will still have the AA as a fallback later.

Those of the Basque Country and Navarre are granted by the constitution, the details where written mainly by the congress of those regions and then passed by the central congress.

&gt; aren't regions(wealthy ones) self sustained fiscally?

Not exactly, the current system is a mess, taxes may go directly to a certain administration (city hall, province, autonomous region or central government), however many times the central government does transfer (you pay to the central government, and they transfer the money to the autonomous region/province or whatever) certain taxes to the other administrations as well as direct transfers of money. Other administrations may do similar things (for example, the autonomous regions usually give money to the city halls).

The problem arises because this is done differently for each region: every region gets different taxes and transfers. The situation is even worse as not every administration has the same responsibilities (for example, the organisation responsible of the security of nuclear power plants is independent in Catalonia).  

&gt;don't local governments(poor regions) have the authority(and responsibility) to take economic measures?

To a limited extent, yes, they can, but only about those things that the central government allowed them, the main ones, such as VAT or income tax are set by the central government.  The details again depend on the region.

On top of that, the chemical attack was a preparation for a ground assault by regime troops(who obviously wore gas masks). It makes no sense for rebels to soften up their own lines for a regime ground assault. 

I study Middle East Studies and read a lot of experts; everyone who actually studies the area agrees that the Syrian government is simply the only one that could have executed this attack: to repeat myself, they are the only one with this capability.

Of course we don't know whether Assad himself ordered this attack or some field commander got desperate, as this article states. Still, there is no reason to say the rebels could be behind it, which is what you say when you say there is doubt. This is impossible, because it would mean a very sudden increase in rebel capacity that we didn't see before.

I can understand if you are against Western air strikes in this scenario, but I can't understand why anyone would think the rebels had the military capability to actually execute a chemical attack, let alone one of the scale we witnessed at Ghuta.

He delivered a strange speech in which he called the founding of his party ""the most important event in history"". He continued to -some people say buy- backrow MPs from other parties and by doing so gained club-status for his now 5-MP-party without having been elected. In his first interview in the 10pm-news, he puzzled the audiance and the anchorman by his characteristical attitude to derail any intervies ([See /u/unseen_redditors transcript](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1d9n54/whats_going_on_in_your_region_of_europe_28413/c9og9ix). His political points have been compared to the tea party by the economist Ötsch. He calls for a radical Thatcherism, a night-guard-state and low taxes. His politics in one sentence would be: ""We are the one percent"". I am under the impression that Stronach does not really know what he is talking about. In his recent TV debate with the prime minister, the following dialogue took place (I may have overheared some words):

*Stronach*: We need a tax on officials, thats where the dog lies burried. They never created a workplace and are alway blocking things

*Prime Minister Faymann*: Who are those officials? I don't know whom you have in mind.

*Stronach*: Just like thos privilege-holders at the National Bank, just like Ewald Novotny.

*Faymann*: Novotny is not an official but the GOverneur of the national bank.

*Stronach*: Thats no difference. They are all SPÖ-officials, thats nepotism. 

All of Stronachs public appearances work like this. He has his often incosistent argument, which he continues to repeat for the next hour. Despite his lack of arguments, he is expected to get 8-9% in the elections. Many of his supporters come from the far right. Despite having the first place on his parties list, which would very likely bring him into pariament, he is expected to resign from politics after this election.

And they keep on inviting their mates over who we find in our bedroom playing with our toys without ever asking us. Mum theoretically gets a voice, but in reality she just does whatever he tells her, and he really doesn't care about us so he runs the place for his kids. This isn't our family and he isn't our real Dad, and we don't like the way he treats mum. I suppose the kids are nice enough, but we'd rather we were still neighbours, who just trade toys, rather than family.
