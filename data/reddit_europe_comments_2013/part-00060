true,Quazz,BELG,Belgium,"&gt;Refused bank loans, looking after a baby was just one more concern as Desart confronted the problems of red tape and rising costs that entrepreneurs say are making her homeland at the heart of the euro zone a bad place for business.

Rising costs? Odd, considering the only thing they've changed lately was actually freeing the pay of everyone, thus, accounting for inflation, **lowering** their costs. Besides, costs are always rising. It's called inflation.

&gt;Trying to emerge from three years of crisis, the European Union has mandated deep reforms to help revive the continent's weakened economy, but Belgium, home to the EU's headquarters, has enacted very few of those changes.

And of course the possibility that most of those reforms aren't necessary for Belgium isn't even considered here. 

&gt;Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have been struggling with stagnation since 2011 and are neither keeping up with Germany nor reforming like southern Europe.

*struggling*, lol, for real? 

Considering nearly every country is pretty much in crisis, stagnation is a good result. There is, in fact, still growth, so not stagnation. Stagnation is prognosed.  Again with misleading information. 

&gt;Its backers hoped the luxury mall and offices would open last year, having secured the site in 2007. But a long list of permits - including one needing the approval of 14 government agencies - has meant it will now not open until 2016.

And the alternative is? Letting everyone do whatever they want? Permits exist for a reason. Maybe that process could be optimized, but the portray it as if it's only something that exists to try and sabotage the economy is incredibly dishonest.

&gt;In Brussels, telephone company Belgacom has been blocked from installing a new, high-speed ""4G"" mobile network already used in Germany and the United States because of the city's strict radiation regulations.

No, they haven't. Again misinformation. What the hell is up with this article?

They've been blocked from placing the masts that Belgacom specifically wants to place, not from placing masts in general. They can still place 4G masts as long as they follow regulations. Other companies need to do this too, not just Belgacom. But only Belgacom is bitching about  it.

&gt;Bureaucracy is swollen by Belgium's division into three regions and three partially overlapping linguistic communities, plus cities and local councils. In total, the country of 11 million people has six parliaments.

Which was a great help when the federal government got into a pickle and basically didn't exist for over a year. Again, maybe this could be optimized, but currently it is a great balance of power, no one group has too much or too little. 

&gt;Such obstacles might be overlooked in boom times, but the economies of Belgium and the Netherlands will shrink for the second straight year in 2013, after a recession in 2009, while Germany is likely to see its output rise slightly.

Wow. Again disinformation. The economy of Belgium is predicted to go flat, not shrink. Don't know about the Netherlands.

&gt;With their trade-friendly location between Germany's industrial belt and the North Sea, Belgium and the Netherlands traditionally tracked or outperformed their biggest trading partner. But since 2010, Germany has been pulling ahead.

Duh. Germany is more of a production country, whereas Belgium and the Netherlands are more trade countries. 

If the trade market gets harder, AKA WHAT HAPPENS IN A CRISIS, then of course they won't do as well. Seriously.

&gt;Belgium is the worst performer. Compared to regional peers, salary costs are more than 10 percent higher than the average in Germany, France and the Netherlands. What is more, the gap is widening, according to the Federal Planning Bureau, the agency on whose data the government bases its budgets.

Because Belgium has also one of the highest taxes in the *world*. High wages are there to compensate. You can't lower one without lowering the other and doing both would harm the economy. They've already frozen current paychecks to try and close the gap a bit, too. I agree that automated indexing may need to be removed, though.

No, no e ancora no. I Rhapsody sono stati l'inizio della fine del power metal. All'inizio come effetto novità erano pure simpatici (e siccome li avevo conosciuti tramite questo tizio delle parti loro che faceva le superiori con me e mi aveva passato l'advance tape confesso pure di avergli fatto una propaganda bestiale) però alla lunga hanno fatto i danni.

* Danni ai miei coglioni: perché questo cazzo di Hollywood metal è come lo ska: prima canzone divertentissima, seconda canzone simpatica, terza canzone meh, quarta canzone piuttosto che un'altra meglio un turno in miniera. Sul serio, al quarto disco di canzoni tutte uguali che vertono sull'importanza di avere una spada da paura questa roba diventa troppo pure per un pischello.

* Danni all'intero sottogenere: perché questa roba ha fatto successo, e come tutto quello che fa successo ha innescato l'effetto emulazione. Il cui risultato pratico è stato un decennio caratterizzato da una pochezza devastante: una marea di gruppi indistinguibili tra di loro tutti velocissimi, tutti iperprodotti, tutti high-pitched tutti coi testi fatti mischiando venti parole al massimo con the fire and the steel. Una roba rispetto a cui Platinette è un modello di virilità e che ha fatto danno in due direzioni: a) piallando lo standard dei gruppio nuovi; b) contagiando anche i gruppi esistenti e spingendoli a fare delle cose orrende (ce l'ho con voi, Blind Guardian)

Con questo non voglio dire che negli ultimi quindici anni quanto a power non sia uscito niente di interessante (provate i [Falconer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ59lALKTCg) per esempio)

EDIT:
Since my comment got a little bigger than I anticipated, I will add a few words. I personally enjoy drinking every now and then but I've never felt compelled to go to Oktoberfest, so I might be the wrong person to give the best advice but, based on what my friends told me and what type of stories I've heard it's not worth the hassle.

First off, that place is crowded, packed with tourists, drunks and passed out people. Not quite the fun atmosphere nor does it feel authentic.

Second, to get to the inside of a tent you need to be there early in the morning - 9ish - And then you have to start drinking because otherwise you can't stay the shitty music played in said tents (really shitty party music played from the hick club scene of Germany)

Third, it's expensive (for German measure), beer will be around 10 Euro / Mass and then you have to eat and all. Same applies for hotels, hostels and shit. Munich is wicked expensive.

If these three things don't bother you, then go. I grew up in Germany and in no point of my life I thought I've been missing out by not going. I'd rather save that money and spend it elsewhere.

Again, this is my opinion. Sorry if I didn't help but OP asked for advice, and my advice is he/she shouldn't go.

Note that the details of regulations can be a bit of a mess. If you are in a situation where you're not obliged to use the public health scheme, you can choose between private health insurance and voluntary public insurance. 

The cost for private health insurance will strongly depend on your age and health status. Depending on your health, costs can vary heavily (anything between 100 and more than a 1000 Euro per month). It can also be declined (which is perhaps more likely than being offered an extremly expensive contract). Be prepared to show all of your medical records from the last ten years. Take into account that there may be a waiting period. 

Voluntary participation in the publich health insurance scheme may be the better option. You can't be declined and there will be a definite cost cap, and it covers everything you need. The problem here is that the usual way to determine how much you pay is as a percentage of the income from a regular employment. If you're basically self-employed, things get a bit difficult; they might use a fictitious income as the basis, and that would get you a bad deal.

true,FrenchyDude,null,null,"&gt;Gérard Villette a réagit au dépôt des statuts du ""Cannabis Social Club"" à la Préfecture de la Vendée                   
                 
Tiens, je me demande ce qu'il peux avoir à nous dire ce Gérard Vilette..                  
                
&gt;Toutes les études montrent la dangerosité de ce produit. Les risques sur la santé psychique et physique des consommateurs sont jugés importants par tous les scientifiques                     
                  
Zavez entendu les jeunes ? TOUTES les études, par TOUS les scientifiques.. Peu importe le sujet, c'est jamais le cas, il est exceptionnellement rare que toute la communauté scientifique soit d'accord, mais j'aimerais bien la trouver l'étude qui prouve qu'il y a des risques importants sur la santé physique.. Ou bien es-ce qu'il se base sur la communauté scientifique, qui est forcée par la loi à ne pas mettre le cannabis ""sous un jour positif"" ?..                   
                 

&gt; En 2011 par exemple, 13% de la mortalité routière était liée à des accidents impliquant au moins un conducteur sous l’emprise de cannabis.                
                
Celui la est un petit peu plus subtil.. Bien sure, si quelqu'un fume et va prendre la route, c'est un danger dans le sens ou il n'est pas dans son état normal, mais ce qu'il faut savoir, c'est que quand on parle des 200 morts sur les routes à cause du cannabis, cela inclut les personnes ayant consommés 45 jours avant, et jusqu'a 90 jours avant pour les plus gros fumeurs. Il s'agit de traces dans le sang, et, bien que les effets soient depuis longtemps nuls, c'est compté comme accident causé par le cannabis.                  
Ca va plus loin : ""impliquant au moins un conducteur sous l'emprise"" peux vouloir dire qu'ayant consommé deux semaine avant, vous vous arrêtez au feu rouge, et une fois le vert passé un scooter vous rentre dedans car il a grillé le feu : Vous avez donc, sous l'influence du cannabis, tué quelqu'un. Direction la prison, et un mort de plus pour le cannabis sur les routes..                  
                    
&gt;Par ailleurs, il est prouvé que tous les consommateurs de drogue dure ont commencé par fumer du cannabis. 

""Gateway drug"", ou comment utiliser un argument qui a été prouvé comme faux à de nombreuses reprises par les americains                 
                 
&gt;la consommation et la promotion de cette drogue est interdite par la loi française. Ce genre de revendications publiques en dit long sur le respect de notre Etat de droit et sur la crise d’autorité qui règne dans notre pays.              
                
C'est son premier argument.. C'est pas bien, parce que c'est interdit ? Ca ne devrait pas plutot être l'inverse ? Et je ne vois pas en quoi c'est un manque de respect, certains préfèrent un joint au verre de vin, ils ne poussent pas les gens à consommer, mais en ont marre de l'interdit et veulent un débat. Depuis quand vouloir un débat est un manque de respect ? Je ne sais plus trop, je vis dans un état dictatorial ou une démocratie ?                  
&gt;C’est une véritable insulte à toutes les associations et à toutes les familles qui luttent chaque jour pour ne pas laisser sombrer nos jeunes dans la toxicomanie.                    
                
       
Dernière chose, la seule ou je sois en partie d'accord. Comme de nombreuses choses (fast food, alcool, jeux en ligne, jeux d'argents,...) l'excès n'est jamais bon. Étant ex-consommateur, je sais qu'il y a une période ou j'ai abusé du cannabis, j'étais en dépression, pensés noirs, et un peu ""jeune et con"", et en découvrant que la plante me redonnait le sourire, j'ai sur-compensé. Vu que l'addiction physique est quasi-inexistante, il suffit d'arrêter, et on n'en parle plus. La cigarette, j’essai d’arrêter depuis bien longtemps, et ce n'est pas la même histoire.              
La partie qui m'énerve la dedans, c'est d'encore une fois utiliser l'argument ""mais pensez donc aux enfants !"" alors que les CSC ont bien précisés qu'un mineur ne peux être membre, alors qu'un dealer donnera volontiers ce qu'il veux a un enfant de dix ans tant qu'il a l'argent (et pas que du cannabis..). Je ne comprends pas comment il peux prendre cela comme une insulte, quand il s'agit de personnes qui fumeraient dans tout les cas, sont tous volontaires, et le font pour éviter de financer le marché noir..                
Bref, je serais probablement le seul a avoir lu ce que j'écris la, mais je pensais qu'à notre époque, on avait passé l'age de la propagande. Je ne cite pas d'étude pour prouver ce que j'avance, mais vous avez tous internet, sauf peut-être ce chère Gérard Vilette, qui n'est pas joignable par email, mais seulement par bon vieux courrier. Il est donc sans doute vrai qu'il faut attendre que sa génération sorte du monde politique avant qu'il y ait du changement, et peut-être par la suite de la politique fondée sur de réelles études, et non cette bonne vieille propagande..

true,finisterra,PORT,Portugal,"Germany has an overall good image and most people admire what is called ""German efficiency"". Since we have no specific historical hostility with Germany itself there is little to affect the view of the germans themselves, most people think of them as slightly cold and detached but methodical.

Above all people certainly have respect for what they perceive (right or wrongly, and here you must understand that Portuguese are probably the most depressive people in Southern Europe) as the way Germans were able to be reborn from the ashes and also how they seem to be able to have better politicians all around. Some say that the ""reborn from ashes"" is exactly why this is possible.

So, the opinion on the people itself is rather good I think. Ad for Germany itself it is nowadays seen a bit as ""the EU"", and I think most of the hostility comes from there. People around here are well aware that sacrifices have to be made and also more than aware that asking for others to pay for ""our"" mistakes is wrong (this is the universal opinion tbh); having said that there is also the sentiment that a lot of what is being done is mostly to protect a certain development model that overwhelmingly benefits Germany and that ultimately everything being done is part of that. *A lot* of people are starting to think about the benefits of simply saying ""fuck it dude, let's go bowling"", with the idea that it would likely seriously affect most others and actually be better in the medium term. Merkel is seen by many as the culprit of the situation not because local government isn't at fault, but mostly because Merker == Germany == EU, and the way bailouts have austerity measures have been made are seen as a way to protect German banking and economy while at the same time appearing as a favour.

The ""Merkel is Hitler"" and ""Germans are Nazis"" is used by a small minority and would be used regardless of the situations since that is what most people think of when trying to be insulting towards Germans. It means little tbh.

One think that I have personalty been finding depressing (and also affects the attitude on the street) is that the news about how this situation is portrayed by the media in Germany and other Northern European countries is much more ""let's play the victim and blame others"" than the one in Portugal. This in turn increases the sense of ""Oh yeah? Well, fuck you to, time stop caring about EU stability and just get out and see the circus burn"".

About the education: The club will take care of everything. Home, education, school, integration, learning German. It's a holistic education that goes far beyond football.

true,Mareeena,SHOL,Schleswig-Holstein,"Jeez, well I have been to Oktoberfest 4 times, unlike a lot of the people who have commented to stay home or go somewhere else. It is a lot different than what most people think it is. For instance: 
#1. ""You need to arrive at 9am to get a seat!"" You don't actually need to get there early, this is only if you want a seat. Do you need a seat? No. There is plenty of table that you can stand at and a lot to do outside of the tents anyways.
#2. ""It's too crowded which makes it no fun."" Wrong. It is all part of the atmosphere. Sure there are thousands and thousands of people, but that is what makes it the Oktoberfest in Munich.
#3. ""The beer is overpriced!"" Ya sure it is, but have you never been to a concert or sporting event? The beer and other alcoholic beverages are overpriced there too. Plus, you can drink in advance/ pregame, so if you really wanted, you don't even have to drink anything there at all. Or maybe just try one Mass of beer.
#4. ""Food is equally expensive!"" You don't have to eat at the Theresienwiese, there is literally a McDonald's about 2 minutes away by foot (at the Goetheplatz) not to mention tons of other restaurants and food kiosks where you can get cheap food.
#5. ""There are too many foreigners!"" Sure there are tons of foreigners that go to the festival, but from my personal experience this has never taken away from the festival's ""feeling"". And to be honest, every time I have gone I have just made friends with other Germans or Austrians, I think the only non-German speaking person I met was a guy from the Netherlands. But honestly most of the people there are just wanting to have a good time, meet new people, and enjoy themselves, and it shouldn't matter where someone else is from for you to have a good time too.
Anyway, here are my tips:
-I recommend going during the week, the crowd will be a little tamer (unless the opposite is what you are wanting to experience). 
-Eat before hand. Grab a Döner or a sandwich to take with you as well.
-As for accommodation, book as early in advance as you can. Like start looking now. I have done the camping thing one year, a hostel another year, and stayed with friends the last two years.

true,finisterra,PORT,Portugal,"Not sure really, it's part of the national character. ""Depressive"" is not entirely accurate, it's more of a fatalist demeanour, a certain longing... a ""nostalgia for when things were bad"", in a way, since we seem to always admire the most tragic episodes.

I have no specific reason really, partially I think it is natural that different countries have a different demeanour; while ethnically and culturally the Iberian Peninsula has more a continuum than anything else Portugal has almost a millennia so it developed some particular characteristics that are generally not considered to fit the ""always happy, loud and filled with bravato"" Southern European stereotype (although we fit others, of course). Unamuno (a Spanish author, which I like very much) has an entire book about it, although at the time he could also be reflecting the XIX century Zeitgeist that was still being somewhat felt (""Cause of the Decadence of the Peninsular Peoples"" and the like, basically an introspection into the causes of the shift of power from South to North).

This demeanour is the basis of some of the best and worst episodes, it's almost as an hyper-valuing of the medieval chivalry ideals of suffering (and indeed this sort of novels were always extremely influential) and I think it is at least partially based on the notion of being a small country, surrounded by the Atlantic and Spain, that tries to aim farther. Note however that this fatalism isn't necessarily ""sadness"".

An example: in [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alc%C3%A1cer_Quibir) battle we lost a lot... that being said, the supposed words of the King are still treasured as if they meant a victory. As the legend goes, when everything was clearly lost, and after refusing any idea of surrender, King Sebastian said ""My lords, my royal liberty will only be lost with my life"". The nobility accepted their fate, start advancing towards the enemy, and the King says **""To die... yes, to die... but slowly"".**

Note that I'm not sharing this as some sort of ""look how great it was!""; I am well aware that episodes like those are plenty in just about every country, or even more heroic ones. What I find it interesting is the final sentence, since it conveys the soul-braking fatalism that affects us to this day.

There would be some struggle against such a unification of course, but in time the progress of racial science would help the people of Europe recognize their shared genetic heritage and take pride in the natural superiority of the European master race. To promote further integration the European government would be well served by funding research in this area, leading to Europe becoming the world leader in race studies and eugenics research.

My recommendation is to get there before lunch, grab lunch (it’s expensive but surprisingly not of bad quality) and maybe a beer in the tent and just walk around the rest of the time.

I've been to the Oktoberfest ~15 times over the last 3 years, on weekends and weekdays, to reserved tables, unreserved tables, large groups, small groups so I think I know what I'm talking about.

&gt;First off, that place is crowded, packed with tourists, drunks and passed out people. Not quite the fun atmosphere nor does it feel authentic.

Well, no. Yes, it's packed, there are loads of tourists (what else would you expect?), and obviously lots of drunks (that's kind of the point). Passed outs are concentrated behind the tents, not an area you have to go to. It's obvious you've never been to the Wiesn, because the atmosphere in the tents is absolutely amazing! It's not authentic, but who goes to the Oktoberfest to experience an authentic German beer festival?! It's a giant party and a very good one at that.

&gt;Second, to get to the inside of a tent you need to be there early in the morning - 9ish - And then you have to start drinking because otherwise you can't stay the shitty music played in said tents (really shitty party music played from the hick club scene of Germany)

On weekends, don't come later than 7pm. On weekdays, you can easily waltz into a tent at any time in the day. There won't necessarily be free tables, but I've always managed to squeeze in somewhere. And then the fun begins. The music is no avantgarde techno, it's party music, plain and simple. People are dancing on the benches, singing and in general having a great time. You don't go to Oktoberfest for the music, you go there for a party. And that's exactly what it is.

&gt; Third, it's expensive (for German measure), beer will be around 10 Euro / Mass and then you have to eat and all. Same applies for hotels, hostels and shit. Munich is wicked expensive.

Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth it. I usually drink 3 litres of beer, that's 30€ for a whole day of massive fun. I spend more in 3 hours at a club. It's a vacation, you can spend some money.


So from someone who has actually been there: Definitely go. It's an absolutely amazing experience, you will have loads of fun. I've never met an exchange student who didn't love the Oktoberfest and I've been with a few. You shouldn't miss out on that. All the people don't go there because they want to have a shitty time.

No, it isn't, at least for people who want to download 8GB games. There isn't the spectrum available to provide enough data channels for everyone to do so. 

&gt; Kinda the point.

Your voice can be easily compressed with better and better algorithms to reduce the bandwidth requirements needed, therefore more calls can be accomodated in the same amount of spectrum. Most people are not on the phone for several hours at a time. It is technically possible to build a network that can cope with the way people use their phones for voice. It isn't technically possible to build a network to handle lots of people consuming data like you do - at least not for a reasonable cost and not without a ton of radio spectrum (which isn't limitless)

&gt; Only because your providers were greedy and did not invest; like they tried killing DSL and provide only analogic 56K RTC lines ""because it costs too much"". We start having the whole country provided with full speed 3G net for about 6 months (or a year ?) and it just keeps running.

The company I have the 3GB plan from is probably the most technically advanced in the country (except for the one LTE operator). There is no way they could cope with tons of data usage from all of their customers at once. They do offer unlimited plans, but not for laptops (and they don't always permit tethering) AND if you're really taking the piss they will traffic shape you.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""because your providers were greedy and did not invest"". All of our mobile networks in the UK, if they have any interest in DSL services, are small players in that market. Our major telephone company doesn't own a mobile network, so there's no interest in killing DSL for mobile services.

&gt; Saying there's not enough bandwidth is the same as saying there's not enough water for everyone to wash. That's insane, you just fuckin invest in the infrastructure in a modern country.

You seem to be of the idea that it's just a case of putting some more cell towers up and there's unlimited bandwidth. It just isn't the case. 

It's similar to thinking that having more wireless access points in your home would mean more people could transfer stuff faster. That's true up to a point, but eventually you run out of interference-free channels (or you didn't have any to begin with if you're in a city) and adding more access points will either make no difference or make things worse.

You could instead just use an ethernet switch and give everyone a cabled connection to it, and suddenly it's not a problem any more. Same argument for 3G vs ADSL/fibre/cable/whatever.

&gt; Which would sometimes requires me a 500km and 4h train trip at about 150€. Something i won't waste just because i want to download a fucking big file once in a while.

Actually there is because 3G is just running in france. And it has yet to collapse (ok keeping finger crossed, but still).

&gt; Your voice can be easily compressed with better and better algorithms to reduce the bandwidth requirements needed, therefore more calls can be accomodated in the same amount of spectrum

You are completely confusing 2G (Edge) and 3G. 2G is designed for voice . 3G for Data. Voice call on 3G are just shitty 2kbyte/sec VOIP on a up-to-42Mb/sec IP line.

&gt; Most people are not on the phone for several hours at a time

Erh most french are. Wouldn't be surprised if most french citizens spent 30-70 daily min on the phone on average.

&gt;  It isn't technically possible to build a network to handle lots of people consuming data like you do - at least not for a reasonable cost and not without a ton of radio spectrum (which isn't limitless)

Which is probably why offers like http://mobile.free.fr/ or http://www.sosh.fr/ definitely does not exist. Erhhh wait.

&gt; They do offer unlimited plans, but not for laptops (and they don't always permit tethering) AND if you're really taking the piss they will traffic shape you.

French providers offer data plans for phones, laptop and tablets; and don't cap in reality. And don't shape. And don't give a fuck anymore of your bandwidth use.

&gt; You seem to be of the idea that it's just a case of putting some more cell towers up and there's unlimited bandwidth. It just isn't the case. 

So freemobile adding about 3000 towers/year for several billions/years is definitely wasting money for nothing because all their network engineers are crass ret... erh wait. Wasn't free the one provider which about invented consumer low cost DSL lines in france ? Maybe they're actually doing something right ? :&lt;

&gt; You could instead just use an ethernet switch and give everyone a cabled connection to it, and suddenly it's not a problem any more.

We're laying 1GB/sec fibers in every new building now, along with phone and power and water, as an utility. Guess what, it works too. The main difference with 3G is that mobile network offer an average of 20mb against 1GB on the phone lines (yes i know we can't offer 1Gb mobile with our current tech, but our current 3G network is up and running, no matter how much ""impossible"" you might claim it is.).

&gt; With all due respect, you are a very special case. Most people do not use cellular data to download massive games from Steam - web browsing, email, possibly streaming music and audio are what people do, any heavy lifting is done by WiFi or home internet.

I was quoting Steam as an example of everyday use, but at work i FREQUENTLY move big databases or several gigs drivers disks for hardware (just wait 'till you have to download a Win 2003 R2 master... and your 3Gb are gonna look like a joke); like twice or thrice a day. it would be outright impossible without our current 3G network.

Not only for that. Closer towers means you can use the same frequency in a smaller area, and use it again on another tower a littler closer. Therefore increasing gsm bandwith in the same area. As for the line behind the towers it's optical dark fiber (technology which can handle *hundred of gigs* per seconds. I don't worry too much about that one).

&gt; I didn't say it was ""impossible"" to offer 20Mbit speeds. What I said was that it is impossible to provide high speeds to lots of people - the technology is just not there. 

Yet they do.

&gt;  If you're in the middle of Paris I'd be surprised if you can get 20Mbit over a long period of time.

I'm spent like half my time there and was there like 4 day ago. did not stop me for a second.

&gt; When I do need to download MS ISOs I use my home connection, I won't even try to download it over 3G

Here's the part you don't seem to get : I use only 3G Net. Like wifi except i don't get the shitty 20 meters range. While i technically have a home connexion i about never use it, i just use 3G Only. And never have to worry about an ethernet cable or my adsl line getting slammed. And it works.

&gt;  I'm fortunate that I have a home connection and an employer with a fast connection of their own, like most people in the world.

That's ridiculous, i don't want to be dependent on my boss' charity to have a basic utility like net access or power.",0,1364588307,null,0,false,0,c94thh2,t3_1b86oi,t1_c94thh2,t1_c94tb9f,null,1431737040,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

1. Riding in the city might be harder than what you're used to, people tend to drive differently in different countries.

3. You'd be sightseeing and walking around a lot, sometimes in places not even a scooter can enter. You'd end up pretty far from where you left the scooter, would you really want to walk back? or jump in the metro and get back to your hotel straight away? 
4. Most of the touristy areas are better navigated on foot.

With that said, there are some wonderful rides outside the city, if doing a day trip I  would also advice hitting the Pyrenees up to Andora and back. Or go cruising along the coast, really there's tons of options. Look at http://www.rentatiger.es and contact Anton.

Imo, this comes from the so called safe haven effect. Because Germany stands strong during the crisis it can sell bonds at much smaller interest rates to get investors to buy them. Germany saves a lot of money on paying back those interests in the next couple of years. Right now it is easy for Germany to get cheap money and invest it.
Nations that are hit harder by the crisis have to give out higher interest rates for bonds to attract investors. They are not as stable as the German bonds, the risk is higher, so they need to give out higher rewards for investments.

2) Excess Winter Mortality is calculated by taking the deaths in the winter period and taking away the number of deaths that would be expected in a normal period (by comparing to the periods before and after). 

So, if influenza (or any other illness) is more common in the Winter and results in more deaths it will included in these figures.

3) Using this method the UK is not the highest, in fact Portugal is


""RESULTS
Excess winter mortality in EU-14
The results show that, between 1988 and 1997, Portugal has
the highest seasonal variation in mortality in Europe, with a
winter increase of some 28% above the average mortality
rate; this amounts to some 8800 premature winter deaths
each year. Ireland also fares particularly poorly with an
increase of some 21% (or 2000 excess winter deaths
annually). Spain also exhibits the same coefficient (21%,
19 000 deaths). England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and
Scotland—both collectively (as the UK) and separately—all
share very high seasonality coefficients. The highest level is
found in England (19%, 31 000 excess deaths), followed by
Wales (17%, 1800 deaths), Northern Ireland (also 17%, 800
deaths), and Scotland (16%, 3100 deaths). Overall, the UK
exhibits an average seasonality rate of 18%, which represents
about 37 000 annual excess winter deaths. Greece exhibits
similarly high rates of relative excess winter mortality (18%),
representing 5700 premature winter deaths annually.
Furthermore, Italy demonstrates a level of 16%, which
accounts for some 27 000 excess deaths. Conversely,
Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands appear to suffer far
less from excess winter mortality. ""

Around noon and in the early afternoon it's more of a family thing. Families with kids having some food and enjoying the rides and attractions. Some people just go there for lunch break. You'll see the occasional drunk teen, but it's (usually) all good fun. On weekdays you will usually find a place somewhere to sit for up to 3-4 people. Maybe not in the first tent, but maybe in the second or third. If the weather is nice you can even sit outside. However, some of the more popular tents might be full around noon already.

The later it gets, the harder it will be to find a place in a tent. Impossible for bigger groups without reservation. Getting a reservation is also impossible unless you have connections or work at a company that has reserved a box or tables.

So if you want the whole dancing-on-the-table experience you gotta come early, like noon, search for a place and stay there until the end. The drunker you get, the more fun it becomes. You'll easily connect with people on your table or elsewhere. If you don't want to end up puking in some gutter after a couple of hours you should pace yourself. The beer is a bit stronger, it's liter glasses and it's always prost this and prost that and another round for all, so it's really easy to get drunk fast. Even if you consider yourself a professional, experienced drinker or something along those lines, pace yourself. If you walk around the Wiesn sober at night, it's kind of a horror show. If you are drunk just the right amount, it's amazing and the fun of a lifetime.

As others stated, it's expensive, so expect to spend upwards of 50€ at least. However, it's also totally worth it. There's tons of great food, great rides and the like. Personally, I had the most fun going there in the afternoon with some friends, drink 1,2,3 mass beer and then take some rides, wander around and call it a day.

If you don't fall in the get-as-drunk-as-possible category and prefer to have a more original, cultural experience you might want to check out the ""Oide Wiesn"". It's a seperate part of the Wiesn that charges an entrance fee and it is meant to be oldschool Bavarian. And it is.

Protips:
If you plan to get drunk, make sure you know how to get home or write it down and place the adress in your pocket. Just take the money you need with you, not because something (wallet, camera, jacket) might get stolen, but much more likely because you might just leave it behind or lose it somewhere.
If you are in a group, chances are, one or all of you will get lost from the group as time progresses. Forget meeting points or set times, that never ever works. Transportation is really good in Munich, no problems there even late at night, just don't fall asleep in the S-Bahn or U-Bahn or you might end up somewhere far out with the next train not coming for hours (happend to me more than once..).

true,arrrg,null,null,"The book you are quoting this from is about witch hunts. The two paragraphs you are quoting from are about two unrelated court cases in [Reutlingen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reutlingen). The chapter this is from tries to paint a picture of how widespread belief in magic was among the people in and around Reutlingen and how the authorities dealt with that belief before the first witch trials in 1565 there. To that end the book mostly quotes court cases.

The first paragraph is about a court case that was tried on the 25th of April 1551. The accused was Mathis Dillinger, a [linen weaver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving#Medieval_Europe) from [Augsburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg). He cut two fingers off a hanged thief and “did magic” with them while playing cards. There is no information on his punishment.

You didn’t quite quote everything relevant for the second paragraph, so I will just add that to my translation. The accused in this court case, tried on the 20th of March in 1551, was Ulrich Russ, a Tucher (those clean and remove clumps from raw wool, mostly by beating it), originally from [Ehingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehingen). He started an argument in front of the house of Jörg Stechenfinger with Stechenfinger’s farmhand. As Stechenfinger’s wife interfered he called her a “witch” twice and threw in a window. His punishment for this was to pay 10 Pfund Heller (I really couldn’t tell you whether that’s a lot or not very much) and he had to swear that he wouldn’t do again what he did in the future (basically a kind of probation).

The author notes that this case is remarkable since it hints at how apparently common and unspectacular the use of “witch” as an insult was back then and that, given the spontaneous context in which it was used here, it was apparently used (much like today) as a mere insult, i.e. the accused seemingly didn’t really believe that Mrs. Stechenfinger was a witch.

What I really want to know is who of those people you think you are related to!

Yes, but after that **they still have a lot more money than poor/middle class people**. They pay more because it's a percentage, which is fairer than a flat rate. So acting as if they'll somehow be rendered worse off than poor/middle-class people is disingenuous at best. 

&gt;And you're not here to judge whose money are made by skill, if he follows the law it's none of your bussiness.

You claimed that the sole reason rich people are so is because they are somehow more 'skilled' at the game of life. I pointed out that that is incorrect.

Even if we ignore the fact that 'skill' is such a subjective word as to be meaningless, if it were true people like plumbers would earn more money than, say, Snooki. Besides that, a lot of rich people inherited their wealth. Hell, the wealthiest woman in Australia (forget her name, she owns a bunch of gold mines) inherited all her wealth. 

&gt;Calling it a ""social contract"" is like some stupid phrase out of a shitty left-wing propaganda.

So what do you fucking call it, then? You put money into society via taxes, and that pays for roads, emergency services, national defence, education, laws, social safety net, and so on. You obey the laws society sets, and you reap the benefit (in theory). If that's not a social contract then what the fuck is it?

In the area you can easily visit Aachen – an hour away by train– , the former center of Europe. It is a small town, with lots of historic architecture, beautiful to the border of picturesque. The cathedral there is also worth a sight, it used to be the crowning town of the german Kings. The Aachen city hall is a very nice piece of gothic architecture. 

Bonn is half an hour from Cologne, as you probably know it is the former capital of Germany, today it might be interesting because of its rich choice of museums.

Take a look here: http://cinemaxx.de/Programm/AktuellesProgramm?switchCinemaId=12

Only TV Shows that are successfull are imported.(e.g. Lost, Fringe, Friends, How I Met Your Mother, Big Bang Theory, Scrubs, Greys Atanomy, House and many more...) The most shows that are imported are sitcoms.
Here: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_von_Sitcom-Serien
Many cartoons are as well imported.


Regarding Radio I don't think what you could mean here with importing media content. We listen to music from all over the globe like in any other country.

The only magazines I know of are Playboy and FHM.

For american internet sites that are also popular in germany just take a look here: http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/DE

true,FrenchyDude,null,null,"&gt;pas besoin d'être un scientifique pour savoir que le cannabis n'est pas bon pour la santé, globalement.              
             
C'est pas vraiment ce que je critique, même si c'est surtout la combustion qui cause des problèmes, et les problèmes physiques ne sont pas prouvés pour la vaporisation ou l'utilisation en cuisine. Ce qui me fait rager, comme j'ai tenté d'expliquer, c'est qu'il dise que toutes les études et tous scientifiques sont d'accord pour dire que c'est nocif, quand c'est plutôt l'inverse et il faut chercher loin pour trouver une étude qui trouve un risque pour la santé physique qui ne soit pas en lien avec la combustion et l'inhalation d'une matière végétale (contrée par les autres modes de consommation).                 
&gt;conduire en étant défoncé n'est pas une très bonne idée               
            
Bien d'accord avec toi, mais c'est pas non plus ce que je critique, et je condamne d'ailleurs les gens prenant le volant dans un état qui n'est pas normal. Mais retirer un permis et mettre des morts sur le dos des gens parce qu’ils ont fumé un joint il y a 3 semaines, c'est plus de la chasse aux sorcières qu'un problème de sécurité. Et quand ils s’appuient sur ces chiffres bidons pour prouver que le cannabis tue, ça me révolte (même s'il y aura toujours des cons pour conduire défoncé, je ne pense pas que la substance change l'individu, et que quelqu'un de responsable aura la jugeote de pas fumer s'il doit conduire.)              
                 
&gt;Je connais peu de consommateur de cocaïne ou md qui n'ont jamais touché un pétard                
           
Également d'accord avec toi, mais le problème de cet argument (et de la théorie) est que ces gens auront probablement fumé des clopes ou bu de l'alcool avant tout ça. Donc le problème vient de la cigarette ? Ou peut-être es-ce à cause du lait qu'ils ont tous consommés avant également ?! Plus sérieusement, tout ça pour dire qu'on ne peux pas déduire que le cannabis pousse vers d'autres substances, a part peut-être quand un dealer propose/pousse vers d'autres choses..              
              
&gt;Le problème c'est surtout que le csc fasse la promotion d'une drogue
              
La par contre, je vois pas trop.. Ils n'ont pas vraiment dit ""fumez tous, c'est super"", ni d'autres choses dans le genre. Ils ont tous eu des problèmes en justice pour quelque-chose qui ne faisait de mal à personne d'autre, et en ont marre. Mais je vois pas tellement en quoi c'est mettre le canna sous un jour positif..                  
            
&gt;le problème serait qu'il le fasse via un site internet qui me semble officiel                     
                 
Ah, le conseil général, ce n'est pas officiel comme site ? ;)                 
                
&gt;c'est un peu trop facile de qualifié de propagande les idées contraire aux tiennes  [...] on s'en fout, le cannabis reste une drogue, ca ne rend pas intelligent et ca donne un donne un regard de foetus avorté.                 
               

C'est la ou nos avis divergent le plus. Je dis pas que le cannabis rends intelligent (bien qu'en musique, il y a un lien étrange..), mais simplement qu'à cause de la mentalité ""on s'en fout, c'est une drogue"" on se retrouve avec des gens qui voient leur vies gâchés, et des problèmes de plus en plus présents dans la société. Les cités sont maintenant des no-man's land, la police ne rentre même plus dans ces cités, et les dealers ont de plus en plus de fric, de plus en plus d'hommes, et de plus en plus de pouvoir. Les problèmes s'enchainent, pour tout le monde et pas seulement les fumeurs, et c'est à cause de textes comme dans mon lien que la situation ne bouge pas.

true,Poebbel,BAVA,Bayern,"So now that you've decided to go, here are some tips for making the experience good:

* The Oktoberfest is actually in September. Look up the dates, you won't be the first person to get to Munich in October for Oktoberfest and just miss the whole thing. 

* Go in a small group (4 people tops). It really increases the chances of squeezing in at tables, especially if you bring girls.

* Bring girls.

* Pace yourself. The beer is good and strong, the atmosphere is great, but get a water from time to time. You are not prepared for what you are about to experience. For me, it's 3 litres/day. I have a nice buzz going, but am not going to pass out somewhere or forget the whole thing.

* Don't bring anything you can't afford to lose. Don't wear anything you can't afford to ruin. There will be stains.

* Write down the address of your hotel somewhere. It's a lifesaver.

* Get there early, the reserved sections are fully booked. Not later than 7pm. Bring some breakfast and a newspaper to pass the time. Please don't be that guy/girl and pregame. You'll get drunk soon enough. Tents open at 9, first beer is served at 10.

* Try to get a table in the unreserved section (the tables around the bandstand), otherwise you are going to get kicked of your table at 4pm. If you don't manage to do that, no problem. Get a reserved table and from time to time look around the unreserved section if you can squeeze in somewhere. Then take over the table by gradually bringing all your friends.

* Despite all the ads, you don't need to dress up in lederhosen and dirndl. Wear whatever you want to, no one is going to judge.

* Tents to go to: Hofbräu (touristy as fuck, but also touristy as fuck), Hacker (great party), Schützen (dito), Schottenhamel (Munich crowd, my favorite)

* Eat something. The food is actually really good, the traditional dish would be a Hendl (half a chicken). Get a pretzel from time to time to fill up.

* Tip your waitress. She decides when you get your next round of beer, so treat her well. Go over board for the first beer (I usually give 15€), then give at least 10€, maybe 11 or 12.

* Don't stand on the tables. Benches are okay, tables are a big nono.

* Be nice to the people around you, get to know them.

* Don't puke, don't pass out. If you have to puke, try to get to the toilet or do it under the table. Otherwise, you will get kicked out.

* If you can, find some locals to party with. Maybe ask in /r/Munich if someone wants to go with you. Otherwise, just ask the people around you. Germans love to practice their English and feel good about their language skills.

For English speakers, it's about [Matica srpska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matica_srpska) publishing a series of books *10 centuries of Serbian literature* which includes multiple Croatian authors from the 16./17. century.

So acting as if they'll somehow be rendered worse off than poor/middle-class people is disingenuous at best.

Yes, because they are rich so it's okay to take lots of money from them. I'm not going to fight this mentality here.

- You claimed that the sole reason rich people are so is because they are somehow more 'skilled' at the game of life. I pointed out that that is incorrect.
Even if we ignore the fact that 'skill' is such a subjective word as to be meaningless, if it were true people like plumbers would earn more money than, say, Snooki. Besides that, a lot of rich people inherited their wealth. Hell, the wealthiest woman in Australia (forget her name, she owns a bunch of gold mines) inherited all her wealth.

Why the fuck are you talking about Snooki? She was popular in her show and earned her money through her popularity. Just because you feel superior over her doesn't mean she didn't earn her money as any other actor. But since she's kind of ugly and does things in which you're not interested it's seems completely okay to say that she is undeserving of her money.


So what? It were their ancestors who were successful and they freely decided to give their money to her.


- So what do you fucking call it, then? You put money into society via taxes, and that pays for roads, emergency services, national defence, education, laws, social safety net, and so on. You obey the laws society sets, and you reap the benefit (in theory). If that's not a social contract then what the fuck is it?

So basically going to Gulag in Russia would also be a part of social contract. As long as the laws are fair, which technically they aren't because no matter what happens richer and more successful will always pay more than poor and unsuccessful but even so it is tolerable. High tax is a punishment.

- Logical fallacies and left-wing Godwins ahoy!

Well, it's your logic, you set your rules, you want to decide who is just rich and who's successful.

- So much for 'I don't feel like arguing', eh?

In any case, save your loonies enough to buffer yourself for several months, especially if you plan to live somewhere expensive (i.e. Munich rents are comparable to Vancouver = ridiculous).

Here is a forum for English-speaking expats living in Germany, maybe you could even find a nanny position...  http://www.toytowngermany.com/
WRT health insurance, it isn't that complicated. I came here from Canada, also at age 28 with no regular income, no fluency in the language, and lived off a scholarship for 7 years. Health insurance was easy, my income was my scholarship. In any case, the best bet is always the public health insurance companies (there are several, I am with Techniker Krankenkasse). I didn't fall into any 'category' and it was still easy, they just considered me 'voluntarily insured' of some sort. They do have a theoretical minimum income which they will sort of 'assign' to you if you are at or below that income level. In any case, I had Eur 1200 per month income and paid around Eur 200 for the insurance. According to the website krankenkassen.de the 'minimum income' that you are assigned as a voluntarily insured person is Eur 898 per month, which leads to a monthly premium of about Eur 130. You will not fall into one of the normal categories either. 'Selbstständig' or self-employed refers more to people who are essentially their own business, like carpenters, financial planners, etc. 'Mini-jobs' are also an official type of regular employment. Your best bet is really to contact one of the public insurance companies and enquire, based on some realistic estimate of what you might earn. Many people here speak fluent English, so it is worth it to just call and ask.
Frankly, dealing with the health insurance company and other authorities and stuff is relatively simple (though it helps to have a bit of German). In contrast to Canada, you can actually talk to real people on the phone without being on hold for 2 hours, or go to an office and get help.",0,1364650306,null,0,false,0,c956itg,t3_1b7mi2,t1_c956itg,t3_1b7mi2,null,1431730825,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

""Les sciences humaines et sociales sont un ensemble de disciplines qui se donnent pour objet d'étude, divers aspects de la réalité humaine. **On les met en contraste avec les sciences naturelles, et souvent aussi avec les sciences dites « exactes », en raison de leur statut épistémologique spécifique** (bien que nulle science ne soit exempte de scepticisme et véritablement « exacte » au sens de la seule réalité, et bien que les sciences qui ne sont liées qu'à l'immatérialité dont la linguistique et la philosophie du langage aient pu faire l'objet de tentatives formalistes).""

With point 1 and 2, it really depends. Normally you should be accepted in Studentenwerk without bigger problems, but you should give your application in as soon as possible. There is no ""Zulassungsbeschränkung"" for Physics (http://www.zv.uni-leipzig.de/studium/angebot/studienangebot/studiendetail.html?ifab_id=224) in Uni Leipzig, so unless you fail to deliver the obligatory papers (check if you need a language certificate!), you will accepted. When in doubt, contact the university, they will surely help you with information.

When it comes to living costs, it depends on your living style. 18k for 5 years would be rather tough, because that would be like 300 Euros per month, which is too little to live even in Leipzig. A room in Studentenwohnheim will cost about 200 Euros. I think you rather need to plan 450 Euros per month (not including insurance).

There should be enough lab jobs in research institutes. I believe the standard pay in whole Sachsen is about 8,5 Euro/h for university assistents.

&gt;Then again, you will have a lot difficulties finding left-wing CEO of big companies given the fact that they all want their company to be competitive at an international level, which is harmed by the left-wing.

Yes, because they only see their company and not society as a whole. The right wing achieves good thing for society by making it good for the companies; the left wing achieves good things for the companies by making it good for society first.

I'd argue that all the safety net, health care, schooling and other public services we have are very beneficial for companies in the long term.

true,plonspfetew,null,null,"I can't answer everything, here's just a bit of information:

1.) Depends on the housing situation and the policy of the Studentenwerk. Foreign students might get preferential treatments because it's difficult to find a flat from abroad. I don't think you can apply before you're accepted as a student, but I can't be sure. Have you checked out this website? http://www.studentenwerk-leipzig.de/en/housing/new-applicants

2.) Might depend on whether you apply for a bachelor or a master programme, and it may depend on the department (faculty). For some programmes, it's just a formality that doesn't take long, but it may be different for foreigners.

3.) Life in the easten part is usually cheap. The mensa offers decent meals for 2 Euro. Grocery prices in Germany are low relative to GDP.

Don't forget minor fees which usually include a ticket for public transport (which is mandatory). There's no tuition for EU citizens, but possibly for non EU citizens. You should check that. 

4.) As long as you're younger than 30, you get a student health insurance, which costs a bit less than 80 Euro a month. If you find different information, that is probably because many people forget that long-term care insurance is also mandatory and has to be paid with the health insurance (it's about 65 + 15 = 80 Euro). It covers practically everything (with the exception of dentures and spectacles) and you don't need to worry about anything.

5.) I can't be sure, as you're not a EU citizen. But I think it is possible. Six or seven Euro is realistic.

6.) Shouldn't be a problem in Leipzig. There are some deprived areas in eastern Germany which you may want to avoid (I sometimes didn't feel safe, and I look pretty German). But there shouldn't be a need to worry in Leipzig or Berlin or Dresden.

7.) That's about my height. Above average, but nothing freakish. And you will get fat one day, don't you worry.

In general there is a lot of affordable accomodation in Leipzig, for 200 Euro/month (including water, electricity, heating), you can already get a decent place. For 150, you can get a shitty place.

2) I would say it takes about a month after the deadline? But that is just a guess. Why don't you ask them?

3) :D That's a pretty reduced diet. 
Here is the deal:  A student in Leipzig can live with about  600 - 700 Euro a month, including rent, transportation etc. That means you will pay about 200 for food a month if you are frugal. (Again, that's a guess!)

If you want to survive with 18k over three years, you end up at a little bit more thatn 300/month, which in my opinion means you'll definitely have to look for other sources of income. Are you egligible for Bafög?

4) What insurance?

5) In Dresden, yes, definitely possible, but only if you also come once or twice a week during the Semester. Doing a research job for just 2 months means that they might spend more time training you than it would take them to do the job themselves. Pay is about 10 Euro.
I would guess the situation in Leipzig will be similar. So, good news.

Anyway, best would be to spend the first semester studying if you aren't an absolute genius. 

6) There are some assholes in Leipzig, maybe at a higher relative rate than in Berlin. I don't think it is unsafe, though. (What do you consider unsafe?) And at the University,  I would be surprised if you ever get to hear something. In Dresden, wich is a comparable city, we have a lot of international students and I think they feel safe.

I've been reading the comments, and apart from a) Questioning the graph because it doesn't appear to suit some notions of who should be on top and that it must be due to corruption and b) Questioning the hygiene of northern europeans... I think it should be interesting to consider the economic incentive behind having good beaches... I am quite sure that in Portugal beaches would be worse (and IMO they are quite good, with a lot of investiment made in terms of both water quality and also sand quality, with squads of teenage volunteers roaming around picking up garbage, cigarrete buts, etc) if they weren't seen as an economic advantage... and I don't think that beaches in, say, Belgium are exactly a tourist hotspot, mainly due to the weather. Things like keeping a ""Blue Flag"" are considered investments and come with mandatory regular measurements, etc.

Beaches that are not used by people generally accumulate garbage and suffer in terms of water quality, and this is true even in countries with great weather, let alone in countries which do not view bathing sites as specifically worth the attention. Lakes OTOH likely have different measurements that make them naturally look worse than oceanic beaches.

BTW:

* Almeida: surname derived from the town of the same name, and adopted as surname by those who conquered it form the Moors during the Reconquest. The word itself means ""plain land"" in Arabic

* Silva: from the Latin ""wood, forest"", also adopted by a specific Visigothic lineage in Iberia. Also applicable to several locations that have it in the name.

* Gonçalves: Patronymic of Gonçalo (High German in origin, Visigothic Gundisalv)

* Fernandes: Patronymic of Fernando and Fernão (English Ferdinand, Visogothic Frithunanths)

* Pereira: ""pear tree"" in Portuguese, but it is a surname derived from the estate with the same name in the XI century, home to one of the oldest nobility lineages

* Rodrigues: Patronymic of Rodrigo (High German in originic, Visigothic Roderic)

* Sousa: location-based in origin, from a Visigothic family apparently (at least in theory)

* Martins: Patronymic of Martim (English Martin, from the Latin Martinus).

I've read a lot about patronymics and matronymics and how they are common in some place today; note that at least in Portugal and Spain a lot of the existing surnames have that origin and until relatively recently (say, two centuries) it was not at all uncommon.

EDIT:

* Santos: ""Saints"", a religious name, not specifically tied to a family but often given to those born on All Saints, and from then on became a very popular surname.

3) Leipzig has always been a very cheap city to live.  That's slowly changing as the place is gentrifying, but in general, it's one of the cheaper cities in Germany.

5) Again, pm me if you want to be put in touch with people who can answer this more specifically.

6) In general, Leipzig is so safe it's almost ridiculous.  It's safe even for Germany, which in turn is safe for Europe.  Which in turn is probably safer than (say) the US, on average.

As someone who grew up in a racially diverse country, I find the brand of racism one encounters in Germany to be different.  It's not the sort of racism that stems from constant contact with people who are different from yourself, but rather that of hardly ever seeing anyone who does not look exactly like you.  I don't know whether that makes it worse or better.

I have many colleagues who are obviously non-European, and in eight years I've only ever heard two reports of shouted insults on the street… and nothing more serious.

Yes, the city apparently has a skinhead contingent, and there are places which the locals regard as unsafe.  But, speaking as someone who hails from a developing country, I find their idea of ""unsafe"" quite… precious.

Poi un giorno ho ascoltato Ankle Injuries (Fujiya &amp; Myiagi), che è recente -e non è un capolavoro- ma si ispira al Krautrock. E' stata l'apertura di un nuovo mondo (Neu!, Cluster, Amon Duul, Faust) che poi s'è allargato al Freak (Zappa, Red Crayola, Cpt Beefheart), PostPunk (TheVelvetUnderground), NewWave (Pere Ubu) per poi tornare agli anni novanta con il PostRock (Mogwai, Slint).

Inutile dire che mi trovo d'accordo con la maggior parte delle recensioni positive di Scaruffi (scoperto relativamente tardi, e comunque dopo questo percorso musicale), mentre su quelle negative non mi esprimo perché conosco poco. Però la parte alta della classifica personale è simile alla sua.

Di italiano ascolto poco, pressoché solo cantautoriale/teatrocanzone. E tanto Jazz. Ovviamente pure musica classica (poco di operistica, a parte Rossini che è stupendo)

Everyone in society contributes to keep it running and help others be successful. 

&gt; Everyone in society contributes to keep it running and help others be successful. 

Precisely, these selfish scum need to understand that no man is an island and there are no self-made men. A man may get lucky and become wealthy, but he didn't do it on his own efforts. His success is born through the efforts of millions of others, who have built the society he lives in that allowed him to prosper. He is no more self-made than we are self-born. People are social creatures and that's the the foundation of our entire existence. You cannot avoid the fact that we very profoundly affect the lives of others who we share our lives. We are made and unmade by one another as social beings and thus society has the right to regulate its members. The community provides for you and you have the obligation to provide your community back.

It's absurd on face to even consider the self to be sovereign, let alone to put it first. Even liberal philosophers like John Rawls, in spite of their methodological individualism, recognize this as contradictory. We're not born fully grown and cognizant; everyone of us is ripped screaming into the world, poor and helpless. And everyone, without exception, owes their very existence to the millions who came before them, and built the civilization we live in. And from womb to tomb, we are manufactured to be the image of the society we live in. To call the individual sovereign is as absurd as calling the cells which make the organism sovereign. We can accept this basic fact, and come to terms with it, and in doing so realize what is needed for us to live as members of society or we can continue tilting at the windmills. It will not change reality. The reality is that we don't have a choice in this matter. We're a part of this collectivist society and we cannot divorce ourself from it. We owe our very existence to this society, which has done the brute work to make our very life possible, and not nasty, brutish and short. We were ripped screaming into this world in a hospital likely supported by public funds, attended to by doctors and nurses who went to public schools and universities. And when our mothers drove us home, she took us home on a public road. When she weaned us off her teat, she gave us milk that was certified to be free of pathogens and contaminants by government inspectors. We grew up watching Sesame Street just like the rest of the kids of our generation, and learned our ABCs and 123s with the help of publicly funded television. And all along the way, the kindness and generosity of many people who didn't even know our name and who we don't even remember blessed our path, from every nurse who gave us a sucker after a shot at the doctor's office, to the people who volunteered their time to make our underfunded school work.

Do these vermin honestly think that they owe nothing back? That we'll just let them go about leeching from society's existence? If we want to ledger up life, you owe a whole hell of a lot of people to not be a selfish, self-congratulatory prick. Either they will understand that or a fast moving piece of lead will cure them of their greed!

Let's take [Bernard Arnault](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Arnault), richest French man and business genius. He is the son of an industrial magnate, who got the best education and went to the best schools. He certainly is a smart man who works hard, and he is well rewarded by being the 4th richest man alive.

Now let's compare him to another hard worker, my friend's dad, who works in a potato chips factory. He is the son of immigrants who had no formal education, he himself got a professional high school degree and started working as soon as he graduated. He makes a little more than minimum wage because he does a lot of overtime (his company would rather make their employees work more than hire new ones). He works hard and is well rewarded by getting a little more than minimum wage.

Now these two people work about as hard, except Mr. Arnault's job is more fulfilling. The only difference is that Mr Arnault has marketable skills in a capitalist environment. He also has cultural and economic capital that was handed down to him.

Being a white man from a well-off family matters more than your revolutionary ideas and intelligence. These are important, but secondary.

You can only control an economic empire through soft power, and even then your control is limited since all of the countries within your 'empire' are autonomous. Whereas with traditional empires control is achieved through total domination and control, just look at the British empire for example, it was *built* on free trade, but was *achieved* through force and the countries that fell under Britain's empire were almost entirely controlled by London.

I get the comparison between spreading democracy and spreading civilisation, but that's as far as modern empire building goes, if you could even call it that, because once a country is democratic and has adopted free trade then they fall under the umbrella of the West's economic empire, since because their economy is now tied to that of the West the powerful countries can exert influence through economic means.

Although all of that is besides the point, the UK and France will likely never achieve superpower status again, I'm sure they'll remain great world powers for a long time to come but definitely not superpowers. I think the closest thing to what you're suggesting would be Brazil, which is on course to become the first superpower via economic means only, although many argue that the very idea of a superpower requires the ability to act with force unilaterally in multiple theatres around the world.

I'm not an expert on how riksdagen works but is it wrong to assume that members of parliament can propose new laws or motions?

A) that would not change the situation for the interpretors, at all. A new law doesn't change the situation for people who ""sentence""/decision etc, has already been decided. As in, if I get sentenced to 4 year, and they later on pass a new law that my crime would actually be 14 year, it does not change the fact for me. Only ""new"" criminals (in my example) would receive 14 year. The law is not retroactive.

B) Passing a law **only** for Afghanistani interpretors would be very close to ""ministerstyre anyway. Or, do you have a lot of other examples of interpretors that are seeking asylum? 

C) You would have to motivate why interpretors deserve protection much more than any other profession, for example doctors, females in any profession in some areas, environmentalists, journalists etc

D) It would have to be something that could be applied to the whole world - otherwise it would be very, very close to making a law just for these people, which would be unfair, and ministerstyre.

E)Of all the departments/avdelningarna in Sweden, why should we take particular care of the ones who work with the military? I'd like for you to give me citations and explain, why the military is unique, in comparison to other departements, like SIDA for example. Or, do you mean that anyone who has also worked with SIDA and migh, according to their own word, be in trouble afterwards, should automatically receive asylum? Should anyone, abroad, who has worked with anyone from the Swedish states, automatically receive asylum. Why are these people so special? Why are not other peopel special? I'd like explanaition and links please. 

&gt;I didn't say that the minister him or herself should hand-pick the interpreters who get asylum. And of course nobody should follow the law; fuck the system. /s

As in, if I get sentenced to 4 year, and they later on pass a new law that my crime would actually be 14 year, it does not change the fact for me. Only ""new"" criminals (in my example) would receive 14 year. The law is not retroactive.

Have all interpreters already applied?

&gt; B) Passing a law only for Afghanistani interpretors would be very close to ""ministerstyre anyway. Or, do you have a lot of other examples of interpretors that are seeking asylum? I know what the word retroactive means.

Do I need other examples? These people are at huge risk and a big part of that is because they are helping us. We owe it to them. ""Very close"" doesn't cut it. A miljöpartist can put a motion about it and they are in opposition.

&gt; C) You would have to motivate why interpretors deserve protection much more than any other profession, for example doctors, females in any profession in some areas, environmentalists, journalists etc

Because many of these interpreters are minorities and because they helped us. These people are now at greater risk because of us. I really don't see why there is a problem at helping people whom have helped us. Or do you want to discuss immigration policy in general because I'm not interested in that discussion?

&gt; E)Of all the departments/avdelningarna in Sweden, why should we take particular care of the ones who work with the military? I'd like for you to give me citations and explain, why the military is unique, in comparison to other departements, like SIDA for example. Or, do you mean that anyone who has also worked with SIDA and migh, according to their own word, be in trouble afterwards, should automatically receive asylum? Should anyone, abroad, who has worked with anyone from the Swedish states, automatically receive asylum. Why are these people so special? Why are not other peopel special? I'd like explanaition and links please.

It doesn't take a lot of critical thinking to understand that minorities in Afghanistan who are cooperating with Swedish or any other foreign military is at grave risk. If we (or any other western country) were never in Afghanistan then this person could have been at less risk or at no risk at all. If he dies or gets tortured because he was helping us then it's our fault if we have not offered him (or rejected) asylum. Sweden is indebted to people who risk their lives to help us. This is why they are special.

&gt; You specifically, in your first answer, referred to the minister. As in ""There are some politicians in Sweden who don't want to give permanent residence to our translators.""

The government still have the power to propose new laws. We even have a minister who is responsible for immigration policy. If they want this to happen then it will happen.

&gt; Well, that says more about you, than anything.

So, apply then like everyone else, but Swedish law do not recognise anything ""special"" about them ""helping"" us. We do not have that. If you want the judges in Migrationsdomstolen to ignore the law, you must be OK with judges everywhere to ignore the law. So, do you think judges should follow the law or not? 




&gt;Because many of these interpreters are minorities and because they helped us. These people are now at greater risk because of us. I really don't see why there is a problem at helping people whom have helped us. Or do you want to discuss immigration policy in general because I'm not interested in that discussion?

But that is the mistake you make. The law is made to be applied ""in general"" and then you *have* to be able to motivate why these people are in more danger than for example the farmers who helped the SIDA personal in Congo, or the doctor who aided SIDA in Sudan. Just because you do not want to discuss it -well, it again says a lot of how you think you the law should be applied. Apperently, you do not understand basic law. So, again, with links and good explanations, why are these people so special compared to the farmer in Albania, etc.  


&gt;It doesn't take a lot of critical thinking to understand that minorities in Afghanistan who are cooperating with Swedish or any other foreign military is at grave risk. If we (or any other western country) were never in Afghanistan then this person could have been at less risk or at no risk at all. If he dies or gets tortured because he was helping us then it's our fault if we have not offered him (or rejected) asylum. Sweden is indebted to people who risk their lives to help us. This is why they are special.

I think SIDA is in around 60 countries, and Swedish, as a country is active in even more. Should everyone, in those countries be eligeble for asylum that cooperates with us? Why is the military special, why Afghanistan? More peopel die in Congo, for example. 


&gt;The government still have the power to propose new laws. We even have a minister who is responsible for immigration policy. If they want this to happen then it will happen.

The minority government. And, your quote ""if they want this to happen then it will happen"" sounds like your really, really like ministerstyre. Is that what you want? Should government base their whole policy, and should Swedish law that affects millions be based on this?

If you want the judges in Migrationsdomstolen to ignore the law, you must be OK with judges everywhere to ignore the law. So, do you think judges should follow the law or not?

You add new laws or alter old ones. One could maybe set up a special program for these types of people?

&gt; But that is the mistake you make. The law is made to be applied ""in general"" and then you have to be able to motivate why these people are in more danger than for example the farmers who helped the SIDA personal in Congo, or the doctor who aided SIDA in Sudan. Just because you do not want to discuss it -well, it again says a lot of how you think you the law should be applied. Apperently, you do not understand basic law. So, again, with links and good explanations, why are these people so special compared to the farmer in Albania, etc.

Is it a problem to make specific laws which are applied to asylum seekers who have worked for Sweden in the past? If any of these people are in danger because they have helped us then it is our moral responsibility to give them protection. Afghanistan is special because we are ""peacekeeping"" there. The farmer in Albania is not going to be tortured by terrorists because he is Albanian and supposedly working for foreign military. This discussion is not about ""immigration policy in general""; It's about helping people who have helped us.

&gt; I think SIDA is in around 60 countries, and Swedish, as a country is active in even more. Should everyone, in those countries be eligeble for asylum that cooperates with us? Why is the military special, why Afghanistan? More peopel die in Congo, for example.

Anyone who is endangered because they cooperate with us should be eligible for asylum. I don't see why it should be such a big deal to offer these people asylum; Especially Afghanis whom have helped us a lot. Do you not want them here?

Yes, 1826-1835. 41000 families, not farmers. I'd like a source for names being russified/germanized _en masse_ though, because I've literally not seen any traces of it. If your landlord was Russian, chances were you got stuck with a Russian name right away, or maybe you'd been given one in the army.

No, one do not make special laws for a few people. That is not following the law, the rules, and it is actually the opposite of working within the law. It is like I would like to make a special law, just to help Nordea, or why not a special law for IKEA: 


&gt;Is it a problem to make specific laws which are applied to asylum seekers who have worked for Sweden in the past?

This discussion is not about ""immigration policy in general""; It's about helping people who have helped us.

Yes, it is. That is *not* how asylum process works. You are also saying Afghanistan is special because it was peacekeeping. So, explain why peackeeping in Afghanistan is more special than HIV prevention in Malawi, environmental protection in South America, or aid in Congo? What makes Afghanistan so special. Why is the military a ""better"" department than SIDA? Don't you think people can get in trouble for helping them? 


&gt;Is it a problem to make specific laws which are applied to asylum seekers who have worked for Sweden in the past? If any of these people are in danger because they have helped us then it is our moral responsibility to give them protection. Afghanistan is special because we are ""peacekeeping"" there. The farmer in Albania is not going to be tortured by terrorists because he is Albanian and supposedly working for foreign military. This discussion is not about ""immigration policy in general""; It's about helping people who have helped us.

Yes, he might, although it might not be terrorist (besides, what is a terririst?). The Albania mafia is superstrong, and he might just disappear. Just as the Brazilian journalist that tried to protect the rainforest with the Swedish Environmental Agency, or why not any Chinese, ever, who might end up in ""camp"" for talking to a Swede. Basically, Sweden is active in over 100 countries. Most of those countries are very bad, and do not respect human rights. What you are saying that everyone, ever, who has in any way connected with a official Swede in all these countries, should stay in Sweden  - despite the law being different. Apart from that you honestly seem extremely naive to the ways of the world, democracy, I can't even begin to understand how you would not only write that law, but also get it through Riksdagen. That attitude is so naive so no one but mp and v would vote for it.

&gt;This discussion is not about ""immigration policy in general""; It's about helping people who have helped us.

You honestly do not seem to understand, and I do not know if you are young  or you are refusing to understand. 

The laws that we make with regards to asylum policy *are* general. All the laws that we make *are*  general. That is even one of the basic rules of the legal system - all are the same in front of the law. Otherwise we would make one law for me, one law for you, and a third law for person X. That would not work. 

You do not seem to get that. The same goes for every asylum seeker. We do *not* make exceptions for people who has worked for Sweden, just as we do make other exceptions in the law. We do not say ""Oh, you worked for the government? Well, then it is OK to beat up your wife"" - we do not say that, because that would be sick and a travesty of justice. You however want us to say - ""Oh, you helped the Swedish government, well, then you get a special law"". We paid these people - that does not entitle them to live in Sweden forever. You honestly think the law does not apply to government employees, it is so weird.

Honestly, you are very frustrating. 

&gt;It's not ministerstyre, the parliament can reject such a bill. However, the only party whom I believe would reject such a bill are the Sweden Democrats. I just can't see V, S, and MP rejecting such a bill.

If the **only** persons who could use that law were Afghani interpretors, it **is** ministerstyre. Don'y you see that? Honestly, is that so hard to understand. The bill that would have to be made, would be a much, much wider one. One, that says for example, that 

* anyone who has cooperated with any Swedish governmental agency and as a consequence of that might be in trouble, is eligeble for asylum. 

That would mean for example that anyone in contact with SIDA, who *might* according to themselves, be in trouble for that afterwards, can stay. Do you know how many thousands that would be? Houndred of thousands perhaps? Do you think that would work

Otherwise, can you explain why the interpretors in Afghanistan are more in danger than the journalist in Brazil (who cooperated with our environmental agency) or the doctor in Congo (who worked with SIDA)? I would like you to answer that. 

Second - I would also like you to answer why the military is more important? Do you have any legal precedence why it is so? Otherwise, someone who has worked with any official Swede, abroad, might be eligable for asylum. That means that people from + 100 countries are eligeble for asylum in Sweden. Is that what you mean? Or, explain again, why they interpretors are more special, you have not sufficiently done so. 

So, for the last time - if the law can only be used by interpretors it is not a law that we should have. It is a stupid law. And, again  -it would be ministerstyre and bad governing. 

So, what you essentially are saying is that anyone, anywhere, who has worked with official Swedes, should be eligelbel for asylum - that is the law you want? 

And please, at least try to understand how the law work and that you can not write special laws for Afghani interpretors.

If you didn't [have/work at] a farm, the other part was then either the founding father of line or description where the house could be found. 

In East Finland people didn't really have surnames, they were just someone's sons. There were some East Finnish surnames, but their origins are clouded. 

Surnames became mandatory only at the start of 20th century (to help categorise people). Of course, this didn't really work, so later we got social security numbers. Anyway, many people chose their surnames from published lists or just came up with something with personal meaning or something that had character. 

I've sometimes entertained myself by asking people I've met how they ended up with the surnames they had.

People could choose whichever surname they liked and that's why the most popular Turkish surnames are such grandiose names as Özturk, Yılmaz, Erdoğan, Demir, etc. Totally different from e.g. German surnames which nearly all have to do with the occupation of some long-ago ancestor.

It's interesting that given a free choice, the majority wants to change that though (some didn't, a lot of ""-oğlu"" with names and occupations still around). The choice of names probably has a lot to do with the fact that the country was only 11 years out of a war of independence with rampant nationalism. My own last name is disturbingly and aggressively nationalistic as well.

I'm actually not sure how surnames used to work in Europe. From my limited knowledge in history, for the Ottomans, the patronymic references were not set in stone like you would expect a last name to be. Nicknames were prevalent as well to tell people apart, but I'm not sure whether any of that was official. People were usually referred to by their names plus their title like Bey (Mr.), Hanım (Ms.), Paşa (General), Doktor etc.

edit: I'm going to add that the name has always been more important than the last name, in modern Turkey as well as the Ottomans. It becomes more obvious if you're familiar with soccer. The most common way to refer to the players is by their first name, with perhaps an additional nickname or last name if there are two players by the same name on the team or field.

Ho dato vari esami di economia:micro,macro, dello sviluppo(micro e macro),europea, internazionale e pubblica. I concetti economici sulla base dei quali ho fatto le affermazioni che ho fatto sono semplicissimi ed evidenti,non credo onestamente che sia necessaria una laurea in economia per comprenderli. Sono comunque molto lunghi da spiegare, mi perdonerai se non faccio un sunto di quello che ho imparato in 7 esami in un post qui :)

So peró che Bagnai rappresenta un'esigua minoranza fra gli studiosi. Molti miei professori, giovani molto in gamba e in ascesa nel mondo accademico (non di certo baroni,troppo giovani :D ), ci hanno ben spiegato come non ci siano abbastanza studi quantitativi che supportino le teorie di Bagnai, molto piú basate su considerazioni storiche e politiche che economiche. 

Ho passato molti anni a studiare PRECISAMENTE il fenomeno euro, negli ultimi anni soprattutto in relazione alla crisi. La maggior parte dei miei prof, britannici di formazione euroscettica, avevano tutti un'interpretazione molto simile. L'euro é stata una scelta soprattutto politica, con basi economiche non perfette ma plausibili al momento in cui furono fatte, con lo scopo di rafforzare il piú possibile il coordinamento economico fra i paesi membri, per armonizzarne le economie, rafforzando le piú deboli soprattutto. Strumento inadeguato, ma piú wishful thinking che masterplan di non si sa chi, questo per loro era abbastanza ovvio. Era anche loro opinione comune che i guai del sud Europa fossero piú endogeni che esogeni. Chiunque abbia studiato 5 minuti della storia della gestione economica ed amministrativa degli ultimi 50 anni avrebbe pochi dubbi sull'argomento.

Bagnai l'abbiamo ben analizzato, ma onestamente c'era piú ciccia (in termini di dati e test ripetibili) in certi articoli di 35 pagine che in tutto il suo lavoro di anni. Mia umile opinione poi, ricorda. L'economia non e pura matematica, rimane assai opinabile e soggetta a correnti di pensiero e spirito dei tempi, non é scritta nella pietra. Per ora, peró, il fatto che Bagnai sia in vera esigua compagnia, é soprattutto perché la bontá quantitativa dei suoi studi é in forte dubbio per tutti gli altri. E non perché gli altri siano schiavi del sistema. La missione di ogni dottorando é quella di trovare roba innovativa che ""funziona"", spesso prendendo spunto da altri innovatori.

But don't/can't you have different views of the Euro and in the EU? In Sweden you can hardly find anyone defending the Euro, but roughly half the population want the EU, still. What I mean, can't they argue for more independence by quitting the Euro, not the EU. 

&gt;If we need to pay a fine (after investing heavily in the bailout, relative to our GDP), the EU could be seen in a more negative daylight by the general population.

Honestly, I can't see how they can skip the fine - again. It was one of the many things that started this negative spiral, that no one adhered to the rules, and they have really promised that this time round....

&gt;Furthermore, if Cyprus is given a way out of the Euro, there'll be protests in Holland demanding the same. There are still a lot of people nostalgic to the guilder.

Have you seen any studies done when you have compared economy of the Netherlands to the Danes/Swedes/Brits, or anyone outside of the Euro? 

I mean, I remember being told that before the Finns benefitted some from it (they compared themselves to Sweden) but now they don't. And, since the negative spiral doesn't really seem to end, the Finns are not to happy.  It would be interesting to see if you are still benefitting from the Euro, that is what I mean.

True. But also, change has to be done gradually, or else you get the Greek situation with mass strikes and general popular revolt against the government, which'll result in even more debt due to the economy coming to a halt. It can't be too slow, as your debt will rise, but it also can't be too fast. You'll have to find the right pace to cut in public spending. In order to compensate for a fine, they'll have to overcut the spending which'll result in chaos.

No. I mean there've been some choices made in the past that prove impractical now. Trying to change that, you'd have to go back to the state in where the EU was pre 1990 and rebuild it with the knowledge you've gained.

true,Neitsyt_Marian,NKOR,North Korea,"Well I follow politics kinda closely, so.. tl;dr; the general consensus on the internet is skepticism over the fact that the DPRK will actually do anything. Proof of this is pointed to the fact that they've done this routine before, and towards the end of his rule Kim Jong Il made threats of his own towards SK. 

However, this feels different. The threats from NK have increased in fervor and frequency. It's well-known that the internal power structure isn't as monolithic [not that it was an entirely pure dictatorship since the 80s] as it was during Kim Jong Il's time, and that Kim Jong Un probably has less direct power over military-related affars [which means, indirectly, everything in the government]. That has gone over to several crusty, highest-ranking military generals. The power play between the heads of the military is complex and I will not clam to know any of it

With that in mind, the situation, I think, becomes a bit more serious. I am of the camp that believes that, while direct war isn't **likely** imminent, the South Korean population is unfortunately in some kind of danger.. I do worry about their safety, and of course I would prefer if no conflict happened. This would be unfortunate for SK but also for the population in NK, where every healthy walking adult is automatically in the military. If they go to war, then they'll go total war [this is said directly by them and I don't know too many people who doubt they'd do this]; since the technology level between the opposing states is completely mismatched, they'll try to bridge this by throwing more manpower at the opposing side, which just means the loss of more hapless North Koreans who have already lived a shitty life and now have to die in battle.

That was totally not tl;dr.

France did not do this so far, but they do have a minimum wage for all jobs (or will soon?). Spain and parts of Italy did a very good job but the building business drank too much of the low interest loans.. they have a bubble now. 
I really think that the ability or motivation to work is almost equal in the bigger European countries (East Europe needs more time). The real problem is our interest system, and  no one sees it. So we are not at all treating the couse but the symptoms.
