Dennoch verkauft man die Wasserwerke an [private gewinnorientierte Unternehmen](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veolia_Environnement#Wasser-_und_Abwasserversorgung_in_Deutschland) und schafft statt **staatlicher nicht gewinnorientierter** Monopole, welche legitim sein können um Zugang zu einer Lebenswichtigen Resource wie dem Wasser zu garantieren, **private gewinnorientierte** Monopole.

&gt;Die Unterstellung bloßen Selbstinteresses ignoriert, dass ein Unternehmen den Kunden zufriedenstellen muss.

Ein zufriedener Kunde ist eine Vorbedingung in einem funktionierenden Markt, um das originäre Ziel, einen Gewinn erwirtschaften zu können, zu erreichen. Bei Monopolen und bei Randbedingungen wie sie dieses Lex Veolia schafft trifft das aber nicht mehr zu. Man muss davon ausgehen das bei einer Privatisierung von Infrastruktur IMMER versucht wird Kosten zu sparen, in den meisten Fällen durch Stellenabbau, was sich wiederum in einer Reduzierung der Qualität niederschlägt. Am deutlichsten wird dies in der Telekommunikationsbranche. Hier wurde nur bis zur Privatisierung in neue Technologien investiert. In den neuen Ländern wurde bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt in Glasfaseranschlüsse investiert (Stichwort: OPAL), danach wurde nur noch das was größtenteils schon im Boden lag, zum überwiegenden Teil halt Kupferleitungen, bis zur Schmerzgrenze ausgereizt. Das hat allgemein bekannte Konsequenzen: Versorgungslöcher in ländlichen Gegenden, hauptsächlich bis zu 16Mbit in erschlossenen Gebieten, meist aber deutlich weniger, und nur in ganz wenigen Fällen kann man mal Glück haben und in der Nähe eines Verteilerkastens wohnen und VDSL bekommen, wenn der nicht schon voll belegt ist. Bei der Anzahl der Glasfaseranschlüsse tauchen wir im [europäischen Vergleich](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Glasfaseranschluesse-in-Europa-Deutschland-unter-ferner-liefen-1807096.html) nicht mehr auf. Da sind unsere Nachbarn schon deutlich weiter (Zitat aus folgendem [Artikel](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasfasernetz) zu den Niederlanden):

&gt;In den Niederlanden ist der Netzausbau mit FTTH (Anmerkung: Fiber To The Home = Glasfaser bis ins Haus) bereits weit fortgeschritten. In vielen größeren Gemeinden sind alle Haushalte mit eigenen Glasfaseranschlüssen ausgestattet. Weitere Glasfasernetze befinden sich im Aufbau bzw. in der Planungsphase. Als größter Netzbetreiber ist die Firma Reggefiber zu nennen, die derzeit 144 Gemeinden erschlossen hat und sich in 31 Gemeinden in der Planungs- bzw. Genehmigungsphase befindet (Stand November 2011). Reggefiber ist ein Joint Venture der Investierungsgesellschaft Reggeborgh und der KPN. Das erklärte Ziel ist es, den Netzausbau stetig voran zu treiben und bis 2015 90 % der Haushalte mit FTTH auszustatten. Die Glasfasernetze sind generell offen für verschiedene Anbieter, die Netzbetreiber treten normalerweise nicht gleichzeitig als Provider auf. Als Provider hat die KPN die höchste Marktdurchdringung.

Der entscheidende Satz scheint mir hier der vorletzte zu sein. Als Preisbeispiel haben sie dort auch ein Tripple play Angebot, es hat also den Umfang wie die Entertain Packete der Telekom, allerdings mit einem **symetrischen** 100Mbit Anschluß, für den gleichen Preis den man in Deutschland zahlen muss aufgeführt.

Both were delayed for years, and with OTE it was because certain people in OTE and companies related to OTE (and Siemens) were trying to stay as much as they could to make a quick buck from certain contracts etc. After they did so and OTE's stock got high or something they sold it for even more. Meanwhile greek consumers were getting ripped off in prices. I am telling you stuff like that is happening with a few other companies that currently resist privatization.

&gt;I said the top 5-10%, not the top 0.000001%.

That doesn't change my statement. Most well-earning positions are some kind of representative or decision making position, and by definition only a small percentage of an organisation can be a decision maker. You can't inherently blame people for not increasing the pie in a zero-sum game.

&gt;A top scientist is wasted mopping floors, and a greasy spoon frier cook is not going to be as good at running a 40,000 person organisation as a top manager is.

They might very well have the capabilities required, but didn't have the connections that allowed them to get the opportunities to develop those.

&gt;Being held back by gender also affects the positions you get before you make CEO, preventing people from gaining the necessary experience and domain knowledge that male competitors have had.

true,chemcat392,null,null,"True, some companies say that they would leave if Catalonia became independent, but many others say that they would come here or they would stay. Some even support our ""cause"". It's also true that a big market is Spain itself  but there's a huge market out there also. Spain would try to boycott our products, it's not like it would be the first time anyway, they have done it more than once (sort of unsuccessfully since they ended up ""having"" to go back buying our goods). We are kinda used to it. 

I probably didn't express myself properly. It was surely not a war between Spain and Catalonia but once it was over, we were attacked in a different way. Franco banned the use of Catalan everywhere, our holidays, our anthem; our whole culture was banned. Catalan was still taught in some schools *illegally* so some people could learn it. For example, my grandma can't write in catalan (she was born shortly before the Civil War), my parents can write in it but they don't really know the ortographic rules (why you use that thing here but not there, when this word has an accent (è,é,à,...) or when it doesn't,...) and people schooled by the end of the dictatorship can write in Catalan perfectly (and in Spanish as well). 


There are different flags around Spain, each Comunidad has one; but I've never heard of anyone burning up an andalusian flag or an extremaduran flag (two different Comunidades in Spain). However several senyeres and [ikurriñas](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikurri%C3%B1a) have been burned up, and nothing happened, while you **can't** burn a spanish flag ( I'm not saying that it should be allowed to burn spanish flags, but it's unfair that our flags can be burned with no punishment but not ""theirs""). In the meantime, Franco's flag has been seen in demonstrations and nothing happened either (and they are illegal).


For example, Spain's symbol is a bull, which is in someway related to partying, while Catalonia's symbol is a donkey, a hard-working animal. Catalonia disapproves bullfighting, we managed to ban it in Catalonia a couple years ago, but in the rest of Spain (except for Canary Islands, they also banned it in 1991) is a cultural thing. Actually, they want to make it official that it is a cultural thing now, which would repeal our laws against it. I must say that some catalan festivities involve torturing animals, and has been tried to ban them as well. These do not hurt the animal like in bullfights but it is still unnecessary stress for the animal (in my opinion)


It's true that some feel both catalan and spanish, in fact the other day I came across this man praising Franco's dictatorship in Barcelona; saying that during Franco's dictatorship there were less unemployment and less problems than now, but of course, you could complain if you were on his side, but if you weren't... Complaining was certainly was not an option. 

I'm not against people feeling both catalan and spanish, but the feeling of our need to become independent from Spain has increased a lot in the last 5 months. Especially when our president Mas (and the rest of catalan society) is compared with Hitler and Mussolini. Good job! (Ironic mode on). But, of course, we are not supoosed to be offended. 



Last opinion: I don't see why we would want to be part of a country where we are not welcome, where we have been insulted for being born in Catalonia, speaking in Catalan and being proud of it. 

If they don't want us, and ""we"" don't want to either, why does it have to be such big of a deal to let us go? Money is the issue, as usual

Nello stesso modo in cui Berlusconi non è di sinistra, Bersani non è fascista, eccetera. Per il M5S rappresentare i cittadini è altro, lo sta dimostrando nei comuni e nelle regioni e spero anche in parlamento. 

&gt; e che quindi i voti degli altri non sono buoni quanto i tuoi. Per carità, anche io non capisco chi vota Berlusconi, ma non è che non riconosco valido il suo voto.  

Avere una idea diversa non significa delegittimare quelle altrui e tantomeno i voti diretti a forze che sostengono idee diverse. Essere però convinti di una idea significa che si pensa che possa andare bene per tutti (se si è intellettualmente onesti).  

&gt; Per altro in che modo è più rappresentante dei cittadini il tizio dei microchip che magari ha preso 104 voti alle 'parlamentarie' rispetto a chiunque altro? Non è paracadutato dall'alto come uno Scilipoti qualsiasi?

A parte il fatto che ovunque altrove è pieno di eletti che non hanno preso voti a primarie/parlamentarie perlappunto perchè paracadutati (your point is moot), per le altre forze politiche il concetto di rappresentazione si ferma alle elezioni, per il M5S invece comincia all'elezione del singolo, che si impegna a portare le istanze dei cittadini in maniera continua e non ad agire come crede con delega in bianco.

&gt; E in che modo è portavoce dei cittadini se non appena contraddice Grillo viene espulso? In che modo sono rappresentanti se gli è proibito parlare coi giornalisti o avere opinioni difformi?

Non si vieve espulsi per aver contraddetto Grillo, se no non ci sarebbe più nessuno. Semplicemente ci sono degli impegni etici e diventare una personalità della politica come stava cercando di fare Favia (fail) o Tavolazzi non è quello che dovrebbe fare un aderente al M5S. Sull'avere opinioni difformi, anche lì il punto è irrilevante: gli eletti del M5S non riconoscono a se stessi la libertà di mandato, le loro dichiarazioni dovrebbero essere sintesi del volere dei cittadini, non opinioni personali.

&gt; Io non ho votato M5S, ma le mie tasse pagano lo stesso gli stipendi dei loro deputati, quindi loro rispondono anche a ME. 

E infatti sei incoraggiato dal M5S stesso a comunicare le tue necessità e i tuoi desiderata. A livello locale funziona esattamente così: semplici cittadini, a prescindere da come si riconoscono politicamente, presentano istanze e il M5S le porta nelle istituzioni.

&gt;  E non si possono permettere di pensare che loro sono migliori di tutti gli altri per definizione e per tanto esentati dal rispondere di quello che fanno se non a Grillo.  

Ma basta con sta storia, ripeterlo non lo renderà vero.

&gt; Come mi irrita profondamente l'atteggiamento arrogante di un D'Alema lo fa anche quello di supponenza dei vari deputati M5S che si ritengono i depositari dell'unica verità.  

Pure a me e infatti dovrebbero stare zitti invece di spandere le *loro* verità, come ho già scritto altrove.

&gt; Infine posso capire che sia necessario rinnovare la classe politica, ma l'assunto che chi sta lì da più di tot anni sia necessariamente marcio può anche essere vero nel 95% dei casi, ma è sbagliato per principio.  

Però se stai lì per max 10 anni è difficile che diventi marcio marcio. Del resto se siamo d'accordo che è vero nella stragrande maggioranza dei casi questo on giustifica una cura? Non prendi antibiotici quando sei malato perchè essi uccidono anche batteri non patogeni?

&gt; Finché le cose continuano così potranno anche arrivare al 99.9999% dei voti, ma non avranno il mio perché non rappresentano tutti i cittadini, e soprattutto non me.

The way some Austrians have reacted to them is enraging.  The jobsworth bastards in burocratic institutions, zero attempts at explaining what is needed or wanted from them and then screaming at them when some form hasn't been completed in exactly the right way. My girlfriend is from Bucharest, and every door magically opens quicker when I go anywhere with her.  We even had someone backdate a document by a few days! Amazing! The thing is, I can't always be there to chaperone her around, she's not a child.  She speaks German fluently, even has a job that she hasn't ""stolen"" from an Austrian (seriously if you need a job in Vienna just learn German and become a receptionist, there seems to be a gap in the workforce. The unemployment office never sent anyone remotely able to do the work for months).  

One thing I will say: Romanians seem a little closed off when they get into groups of their own.  Maybe they're scared of what Austrians might say, or the Viennese are too cold and unapproachable, there is definitely some truth to that.  But they all want jobs, they all want a good life like anyone else, and they're certainly not interested in living on €700/month, which is frankly a stupidly low amount to mooch for.  Yes, there are exceptions, yes, most Augustin-sellers (equivalent of the Big Issue in Austria) are of Roma descent now, and yes there are a few girls who sing in the underground begging for money.  Yes, there are some who, like some Austrians, Germans, Serbs, Poles, Italians, Spaniards and even Brits, cheat the welfare system somehow, but that's outweighed by those paying into it.

Get real: as Austrians, we have benefitted from Romania joining hugely as well, and I don't just mean our gigantic construction corporations getting the deals for building motorways in Romania and stuff like that. I mean the increased percentage of pretty girls in the street, I mean the friendly neighbours you can count on to help you out when you move in somewhere, I mean fun parties, very close friends from nothing and an awesome new country to explore. I even mean the busloads of Romanian tourists who can easily travel to Vienna and invade the Christmas market to buy overpriced shit, I mean the new programmer at work who seems to be a total whizkid at maths, I mean the dudes who add to the fun at mountainbiking events, I mean the added drama, becauses Jesus Christ Romanian chicks are good at being dramaqueens.

Totalmente d'accordo.

&gt;Spain would try to boycott our products, it's not like it would be the first time anyway, they have done it more than once.

Yes, campaigns started by right-wing newspapers like Intereconomia or LaRazón?, followed by the usual morons, but you say Spain like 3 or 4 times, blaming the whole country for the behaviour of a few.

About the Civil-War, everyone knows that the Basque Country, Catalonia and a few other regions suffered more and the dictatorship was a shameful part of spanish history. I am sure that if it wasnt for Franco there wouldnt be so many ""conflicts"" in the current Spain.

You have never heard of anyone burning an andalusian or an extremaduran flag because they are two regions that almost no-one gives a fuck, seriously, do you ever see Extramdura on the news?, because if you open a newspaper or watch the news, its all about things happening in Madrid or Catalunya. I have seen many images of people burning the spanish flag without punishment. This thing about the flag sounds like if it was a common thing in Spain to burn catalonian flags :O .

&gt;For example, Spain's symbol is a bull, which is in someway related to partying, while Catalonia's symbol is a donkey, a hard-working animal.

Its the first time in my life that I read that the bull is related to partying, what??! . And the guará (catalan donkey) is a symbol of catalunya because only lives in Catalonia and its in danger of extinction, not because its a hardworking animal (implying that the catalans are hard-workings and the spanish arent). 
I find it funny because the catalans like to party the same as the rest of the spanish, but you twist every simbol and everything regarding Spain vs Catalonia.

About the bullfighting, I dont like it also, and I was happy when Catalonia banned it, because it could represent the first step for the rest of Spain. Have you been in a bullfighting ring recently?, because only some spanish people over 60 and tourists go there.

&gt;It's true that some feel both catalan and spanish, in fact the other day I came across this man praising Franco's dictatorship in Barcelona; saying that during Franco's dictatorship there were less unemployment and less problems than now

So, I say that also many people feel spanish and catalans at the same time, and your answer is to say that you came across a man praising Franco??, are you implying some relationship there?, everyone who feels catalan/spanish is a fascist to you?.
Becase I could also say that I have heard catalans saying that the [Gasol brothers] (http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau_Gasol) were retarded because they have said in several interviews that they dont have any problem being catalan and spanish.
I also know people who said that Xavi and Puyol (famous soccer players) were fascists because they played for Spain, and celebrated with the rest of the spanish players when the World Cup was won, and they waved la senyera(oficial Catalan flag) instead of la estelada (independent Catalonia flag). Apart from catalans calling Xavi and some of my friends ""charnegos"" (peyorative term for spanish people who inmigrated to Catalunya ). But I dont go around the internet or my life generalizing or blaming all the catalans because of a few morons.

&gt;Especially when our president Mas (and the rest of catalan society) is compared with Hitler and Mussolini. Good job!

Again, who did that?, the extreme-right?, Jimenez Losantos?, because any common spanish citizen would never say that seriously, you blame the whole society for the behaviour of a few individuals.

&gt;Last opinion: I don't see why we would want to be part of a country where we are not welcome, where we have been insulted for being born in Catalonia, speaking in Catalan and being proud of it. 

I feel sorry if all the spanish people you have meet have treated you like that, but I doubt that thats the case. As I said before I have met many catalans in Andalucia (where I am from,  but hey!, maybe they are not pure catalans because their grandparents were born in the south, right?) and other parts of Spain, and they were treated like the rest of the people,. When I was on Erasmus, there was also many catalans between the spanish people, and we mixed pretty well, we didnt have any problem or felt that we were so different. 

I have the feeling that you only watch spanish ultra-right wing media to re-assure yourself and your view of the world.

Yeah, and meanwhile in Scandinavia, very few people go to private schools, because the public schools are good, increasing social mobility, allowing children of poor parents to get a good education, allowing them to realise their dreams and ultimately contribute to innovation in our societies. I currently live in the UK, and I won't say I'm particularly impressed with the school system, especially not looking at people who went to even the poshest of private schools.

Inutile menzionare la quasi inesistente evoluzione del modello economico, che da solo altri problemi, aumentando il divario tra la -reale- disponibilità tecnologica e chi può utilizzarla. 
Guardo al prossimo futuro più che al presente e vedo la quasi totalità della popolazione sempre connessa ad Internet, per mezzo di supporti inseparabili, più facili da trasportare degli Smartphone o dei Google Glass e la mia personale previsione è che ciò possa accadere non oltre 5 anni da ora.

Detto ciò, vedo nel Movimento un primo, coraggioso passo nella giusta direzione: in primis un accesso libero per tutti alla rete, da cui deriva perlomeno la possibilità di informarsi in modo diversificato, in secundis l'avere sempre sott'occhio le azioni che vengono intraprese da chi sta prendendo decisioni per noi. La più grande critica che viene mossa al Movimento è proprio la mancanza di una interconnessione diretta tra eletti e cittadini (che a livello regionale c'è ed è molto forte), ma gli attivisti si stanno muovendo con forza in questo senso. È qualcosa che, molto probabilmente sarebbe accaduta normalmente... ma quando? Ecco, penso che sia stato un modo di accelerare l'avanzamento di questa componente della nostra società.

C'è, giustamente, chi sostiene che la rete partorisca anche un'inifinità di cagate, ma guardate anche quante cose positive ha portato a livello globale. La tendenza che ho notato, o forse sono un pò ottimista e questo ve lo concedo, è che le cose importanti o utili vengono riconosciute e prima o poi diventano virali. Sempre mantenendo la fronte alta e guardando un pò più in là del domani, personalmente credo che non ci sarà alcun futuro per i troll e la maggior parte dei contenuti condivisi sarà di un certo spessore. Reddit è un grande esempio di come chi abbia delle fonti attendibili venga riconosciuto dalla collettività e abbia la possibilità di confutare chi scientificamente non ha ragione.

Come ho detto, è solo un primo passo, ma le prime conseguenze si possono già osservare e altre non tarderanno ad arrivare: il fatto che ogni eletto abbia un curriculum disponibile alla visione rende il tutto più trasparente; con il tempo le persone disponibili a collaborare aumenteranno e così la qualità dei curriculum di chi verrà eletto sarà sempre maggiore -&gt; anche gli altri partiti dovranno proporre persone altrettanto competenti per tenere il passo. C'è una più sana competizione, insomma.

I live in Germany and see problems made by some people from these countries on the streets, but I also have 2 really great Romanian colleges. There are also surely more sensible and delicate political measures to make sure the welfare system in western European countries aren't abused. But I would like to point out an error or staight-up manipulation in the article, namely where the author argues that only 2% of all crimes in London are committed by Romanians. You can't compare Romanian crimes with non-Romanian crimes without looking at the sizes of the two populations.

If 1/3 of Romanians are jailed for theft or rape, and 300 000 such crimes are committed in total each year, and Romanians account for ""only"" 2% of all such crimes, we can calculate:

300 000 x ,02 = 6000 total Romanian crimes
6000 / ,333 = 18018 London Romanians total (criminal and non-criminal)

If we subtract the Romanian population from the non-Romanian population of London and the Romanian crimes from the total crimes:

8 174 100 - 18 018 = 8 156 081 (googled the population)
300 000 - 6000 = 294 000

294 000 (non-Romanian crimes) / 8 156 081 (non-Romanian population)= 0,036

That means that while 33% of the Romanian population of London is criminal, only 4% of the non-Romanian population is criminal (assuming the author of the article is accurately comparing jailed Londoners per year for theft and rape only)

I mean, that is an insanely large difference, and regardless of your opinion on the matter, I think its unprofessional of the author manipulatively present the data.

However, the north is always forgotten about I feel like when people think of Spain (besides Barcelona obviously). Galicia is beautiful, albeit hard to get to/get around. If you can rent a car, Santiago de Compostela, A Coruna, Finisterre, the towns along the Ria de Pontevedra (A Toxa, A Lanzada), and Ribadeo (Playa de las Catedrales) are all well worth visits. It's nothing like the rest of Spain. It's super green, there is a second language spoken here and it's a really great place to come and think. The people and the surroundings (if you're here on a rainy day) have this melancholy quality that doesn't necessarily sad, but kind of pensive. I love Galicia.

I've never been, but Pais Vasco/Bilbao/San Sebastian are always highly recommended by others. I would love to go, myself. Again, very green, another language is spoken there, and it's really different from the rest of Spain.

If you like the beach, I would definitely recommend some of the smaller towns on the coast between Cadiz, Malaga and Granada (provinces) like Conil de la Frontera, Nerja, Almuñecar, etc. They are BEAUTIFUL, mostly untouched places. Cadiz and Marbella are great and everything, but overrun with tourists. Those three towns are just as (if not more, in my opinion) beautiful than Cadiz andd Marbella combined.


EDIT: Also wanted to mention, don't waste too much time in Madrid. It's not worth it. The art, like another commenter said, is nice, but I didn't feel like it had any personality.

It is harder to find external factors for Hitler, but he did not carry out the Holocaust by him self either 


No, if you want to judge these ideologies, judge them by what they propose, not by what happened under their rule. As people pointed out, there was starvation of millions during the UK's colonialism rule- I think we all agree that does not make constitutional monarchy ""evil"".

true,Reilly616,EURO,European Union,"&gt;what does the word ""pay"" in the treaty mean?

As evidenced by the above, ""pay"" does not necessarily have one, uniform meaning throughout the Treaty. It depends on the specific Article. If a case is brought, and if the word ""pay"" is held to be relevant, then the Court will come to a conclusion as to its definition in that specific sense.

&gt;I have to admit, with nearly 30 years of speaking English as a native speaker, I've never come across this interpretation of the word before, and if somebody asked how much I got paid, I'd interpret that as a question asking about my total remuneration.

Fine. But it's not you who will decide. And it will not be decided based solely on the ordinary use of the word. The Treaties are legal texts. There are specific rules of construction and interpretation involved.
 
&gt;Indeed, the dictionary definition makes no mention of pay being exclusive of bonuses

Dictionary.com gives this definition for ""pay"": ""wages, salary, or a stipend."" 

&gt;a quick check of a thesaurus will list ""pay"" and ""remuneration"" as synonyms

By its very nature, a thesaurus lists words which are not synonyms as if they were. A thesaurus gives approximate synonyms, which is of no help in the interpretation of legislation.

&gt;Now, you were quite right earlier when you said that it's a good thing that the Treaty is translated into multiple languages, as we can look at the words in the other languages and see what the word ""pay"" was translated as. However, from your point of view, this isn't a good thing, as the French translation uses a clear cognate of the English word ""remuneration"", whereas the German translation uses the word ""Arbeitsengelt"". 

You seem to think I have a vested interest in one interpretation or the other. I don't. This proposed law doesn't directly affect me. I brought up the French version specifically because it seems inconsistent with the three versions in languages I speak. There's no point in being intellectually dishonest. By the way, the Treaty in French is not a ""translation"". Each version is equally valid. If any single version could be seen as being ""more important"" than the others, it would be the French, not the English. French is the working language of the Court; another reason why I mentioned it.

&gt;in the professional opinion of a translator working for the European Union, who presumably is aware of any terms-of-art used within the organisation, the German word Arbeitsengelt means the same thing as the English word ""remuneration"".

So? Translators are not necessarily lawyers, and even if they were, it's not their interpretation that matters, it's the Court's. I'm not clear on why you think there is a simple difinitive definition of this specific term in this specific Article, when the issue has yet to come before the Court.

Amen, peccato che lo sport italico sia il calcio, dove in campo si simulano i falli e si trattano tutti i tifosi come bestie, contemporaneamente senza censurare la violenza razzista degli ultrà. In Italia il vero sport è tifo del calcio, nemmeno più il calcio stesso, e quello non è agonismo, è un'area dove le leggi vengono sospese o fatte ad hoc, proprio come nei circhi degli antichi romani.  
Agli italiani la lealtà e la correttezza non vengono insegnate. Quello che ci circonda è il risultato.

Non è ""sbagliato"". Io lo trovo anacronistico ma non mi sognerei mai di rimuovere dalla Costituzione la libertà di mandato.

Spelling reform logically left the formal Sie and its related forms (Ihnen, Ihr) capitalized, but called for the informal, familiar forms of ""you"" (du, dich, ihr, euch, etc.) to be in lower case letters. Out of habit or preference, many German speakers still capitalize du in their letters and email. But they don't have to.

Breastfeeding. It's a really minor difference, but if you're taking time off already why not prolong it for a few months and so on, we know how it builds on itself. The question is, if men and women are mostly equally capable, why is it so bad that women get childcare duties more often? Of course the option to pursue a career must remain for those who want it and are more talented than average people, but don't those people have that opportunity already to make the necessary arrangements in their household, between partners?

I'd prefer a mandatory, equal amount for both parents, so at least that is removed from the equation.

AFAIK men and women earn mostly the same before having children. At least in the US, I don't have the European statistics, but practices differ enough to make that not very informative.

Well, I'm not sure I understand your concept of deserve. I mean, you deserve what you're capable of getting in a legitimate manner. Those who deserve and pursue positions get them. Some people who're not as capable but still partially capable will not get positions, that's just the nature of the universe. I'm not sure what the issue is there.

&gt;So it's not really a strong position to complain about high taxes, while you were probably lucky to land that well-paying job in the first place.

I wasn't complaining about high taxation though, I was suggesting that taxation which increases in percentage with earnings is unfair. If you're not prepared or able to represent or understand my argument then this conversation is pointless.

&gt;You still have more in the end than someone else, equally skilled, that didn't get that job opportunity.

No-one on this planet is equally skilled, and in general those with superior skills for a given position will tend to be given those positions over those with inferior skills.

Right, but by their very nature they reward accurate judgements and businesses full of people who make poor judgements fail, so the very nature of the system is self-refining and self-improving in terms of accuracy.

&gt;If they are needed, they do deserve their wage.

The END GOAL however of Communism is that- a stateless and classless society. The methods to acheive Communism vary very greatly, but the end goal is generally accepted by virtually everyone as Classless and Stateless. Dictatorship of the proletariat is not the end goal of Communism, it was justified as a necessary step to bring about Communism.

USSR did their policies to achieve Communism. Killing political opponents, restricting freedoms etc was not done as 'communist policies"", no. They were done as practical policies *in order* to acheive Communism.

Nazi's Germany actions on the other hand are done more by  ideology than practicality

- Why kill Jews? Jews are a threat to Aryan race. Same with handicapped people

- Why attack other nations? States should be strong and masculine and willing to fight. 


USSR

- Why kill Ukranians? Communist ideology doesnt recognize nationalities. Its done for power reasons


- Why attack other nations? Communist ideology promotes spreading the revolution, and with weapons too. Here I guess we can say that ideology and not just practicality does encourage destrcution



Basically, I think we can compare the rule of individuals and who was more evil. Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot, Pinochet, Hitler etc. 

We can also compare which ideologies are more destructive (as evil is too subjective in this sense)- Capitalism, Fascism, Communism, Environmentalism, Monarchism etc

But saying Communism is worse than Monarchism for example because a Communist *leader* was more destructive than a king.. Im not hot sure on that.

On the other hand, I guess we cant deny of the trend that Communist regimes have lead to terrible attrocities and loss of life.

Marxism-Leninism is indeed *one* variant of communism, but Lenin did see the socialist state as the end goal.

&gt;USSR did their policies to achieve Communism. Killing political opponents, restricting freedoms etc was not done as 'communist policies"", no. They were done as practical policies in order to acheive Communism.

And the Holocaust was not a Nazist policy, they had an ideal of an exclusively Aryan society with no inferior races and Holocaust was a practical policy executed *in order* to achieve their utopia.

No matter how you put it, both act on ideology to reach a desired end-state.

&gt;We can also compare which ideologies are more destructive (as evil is too subjective in this sense)- Capitalism, Fascism, Communism, Environmentalism, Monarchism etc

&gt;But saying Communism is worse than Monarchism for example because a Communist leader was more destructive than a king.. Im not hot sure on that.

Surely that would hold for Nazism too. We only experienced one Nazist regime and by this principle the fact that one Nazist ruler was more destructive than a king or Communist ruler does not allow for us to call Nazism worse.

Companies are only interested in going where it's cheaper for them. They don't care about states and municipalities. Therefore you have a situation where port X is already established, and you try to compete with them without having any competitive advantages or funds to develop your own infrastructure. So, it's not a case of ""hiding"" anything (apart from a conspiracy involving crypto-fascist gay Jews and several flamboyant anarchist Freemasons), but a case of focusing in what is practically relevant.

Cosco does not own the port of Piraeus. Pier 1 is under state's control and the port authority is also going to expand operations. Cosco used Rotterdam and other European ports in the past, but they're constantly increasing their throughput via Piraeus, as it is the natural port of entry for Asia's manufacturers. There's also a geopolitical angle to this, which should not be underestimated.

Given the above, I'm arguing that the state will benefit in the end. You are skeptical. There's probably no way to convince you, to find out who downvotes you, or to demonstrate that you might get the wrong impression from time to time.

""The United World College in Mostar is home to more than 40 different nationalities. Located in a city still deeply divided by the war in people’s mind, it often is a symbol for a new generation of all Balkan ethnicities. This year UWCiM was holding a Cultural Parade to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the UWC movement. We all proudly carried our flags through the streets on the Bosnian and the Croatian side of the city. My Serbian friend was walking hand in hand with his Croatian girlfriend. When an old lady asked her how she could dare to walk next to a Serb, she kissed him. This is when I took the picture. It’s nothing special just a couple expressing their love but for us, here in Mostar, it shows that the new generations are not willing to continue a war of minds.""

2.) In major cities and around the university, you should have no problems. The elderly are often not able or willing to speak English, though.

3.) IANAL, but I think you might have a problem there because you're not an EU citizen. AFAIK you still need a special work permit even for 400 Euro jobs. It might be easier to get a permit to work as a student assistent at university (if it's research or teaching related), but don't count on it. Maybe you could contact the DAAD and ask, they should be able to give you more details.

4.) Really depends, sometimes even on the semester. Make sure you know in advance. Some universities offer English-only study paths, but that seems to be mostly restricted to Master students.

5.) The Studentenwerk is often particularly helpful for students from abroad. It depends on the university, but at some places it's no problem to stay in a Studentenwohnheim for many years.

true,ashvasiudha,null,null,"&gt; Marxism-Leninism is indeed one variant of communism, but Lenin did see the socialist state as the end goal.


Yes agreed. Even though technically he saw Communism and not Socialism as the end goal. Marxist-Leninism is one *way* to reach communism- by using a vanguard party to spread the revolution. The end goal of all Communists are virtually the same, how to reach that end goal is where they differ.

&gt; And the Holocaust was not a Nazist policy, they had an ideal of an exclusively Aryan society with no inferior races and Holocaust was a practical policy executed in order to achieve their utopia.

Well if they have an ideal of a society of no inferior races, then we can say that doing the Holocaust is following their ideal, therefore following their ideology. What Im saying is that in this case Nazi ideology spells it out clearly- Kill Jews. Communist ideology doesnt say to kill Ukranians for example. Do you see what Im trying to say?

Anyways I would contest this interpretation of Nazism that they wanted an exclusively Aryan society. Nazis didnt want to kill everyone else, but Jews and Romas (even this policy changed, for alot of time thier policy was expulsion of Jews and Roma from Germany). Slavs would work for them.


&gt; No matter how you put it, both act on ideology to reach a desired end-state.

I agree. But I  beleive that the ideology should be judged by itself, not how dictators chose to apply it. And on the other hand, dicators judged by themselves, not which ideology they use.

&gt; Surely that would hold for Nazism too. We only experienced one Nazist regime and by this principle the fact that one Nazist ruler was more destructive than a king or Communist ruler does not allow for us to call Nazism worse.

My argument is that we shouldnt call Nazism worse based on the actions of Hitler, but based on what the ideology itself upholds. And in  my opinion, the Nazi ideology upholds principles that are more destructive than Communist ones. For me thats why Nazi ideology is more ""evil"". However, in application- Nazi dictators and Communist dicators have both done very fucked up things.

Meh im not too sure where Im going with this argument. I hope you can see my point though. I guess you are right to say though that it is difficult to dissociate ideology from how it was practiced. Unless if we are forced to say ""theoretical Nazism bla bla bla, Practical Nazims bla bla bla"". No one is going to speak like that in day to day use. Plus anyways Nazi ideology is harder to qualify than Communist one, simply as there was less of an intellectual movement supporting/debating/challenging and forming the ideology in comparison to Communism which has become much more defined thanks to Marx and Engels.

The first one is the closest but most complicated option without using to much Denglish. Preposition-wise I like ""durch"" and ""über"" more than ""auf"" since it underlines the mediality of facebook rather than treating it as a place. It is a little problematic though, since it implies that you are passively allowing access to the thing you share, rather than actively sharing.   

The second one uses ""mitteilen"" which can literally be translated ""share with"". It is mostly used in the sense of ""to notify"", but I think it fits nicely in this context.

Anyway. Its just playing around on my part. Just stick with the convention, as nobody really cares about Denglish. You could probably use ""share on facebook"" and people would be less confused than by an unconventional translation.

If you are really serious about doing research in science or having a professor position in an university, then you'll have to apply on the best university in France possible. I know that, in mathematics at least (and i'm pretty sure it's the same for other sciences), the university where you studied in France is very important, since pretty much all the good science students don't go in universities but choose the ""prepa"" cursus ( it's more or less advanced courses ) and then try to enter the well-known school (grandes écoles, ENS). It means that usually the level in the university is lower than the one one may find in this kind of school. Since there are not much positions available, it is more likely that the one who's gonna have the position will be the one from one of the good university and the one who worked with a well-known advisor (because who you had work with matters a lot in France). You can easily confirm this fact by looking where the known researcher in France studied. Most of the time they are from École Polytechnique, ENS or some parisian university. To sum this up : who you had worked with and where you got your PhD is very important here so aim for the best. 

If you are looking to do engineering studies, than you'll have to look as soon as possible for that since they have a particular system for entering the engineering school (grandes écoles).

For the language issue, more and more school/university offer their courses in English in order to bring foreigner students.

No idea. My guess: 200-250€ per month per single room. That's the price i would expect for a student room in a small city like Valle D'Aosta.

No. 

There weren't too many women out though, as it was still quite early and dark, and most of the ones we saw were a bit far away (across a square, etc). We caused a few women some real fear, screaming and panic as a tall man in a long, dark coat ran at them yelling ""I just want to give you a flower!""

The optimal solution, due to equity concerns, would be for the government (if it could) to provide cash subsidies directly to poorer households, thereby preserving information and avoiding overconsumption of resources due to artificially low prices.

While private enterprises can be corrupt and inefficient as well, the fact of the matter is that employment contracts are generally more flexibile, allowing for a better approximation of skill sets between workers and their employment, leading to higher productivity in the private sector overall. As for efficiency, an enterprise that is profligate may be faced with the prospect of being out-competed in the marketplace. The government, on the other hand, has the power to provide monopolies, to run ad infinitum deficits, etc if it lacks proper oversight.

&gt;""Anti-multiculturalism"", as you call it, is the ideological foundation of nazism — I'm not even being hyperbolic here, it literally is.

What a load of shit! There is a wide array of people who are against multiculturalism. Some favour assimilation, others don't want to bother with assimilation and defend that immigrants should come from culturally close nations to avoid any hassle, etc.... Being anti-multiculturalism does not imply nazism nor even racism. Only leftist muppets like you would think so.

&gt;""HURR DURR BUT CULTURE ISN'T RACE"" — yes it is.

So when people criticize Islamic fundies they're not talking about their backwards culture but about their race? See how silly you sound?

&gt;It doesn't matter if it's culture or race, you still believe in racial essentialism.

Or perhaps he just believes a culturally homogeneous nation is better than a ~~divided~~ multicultural one.

Latvia and Estonia have large Russian populations. These Russians are basically settlers, deliberately brought to the northern Baltics to dilute and Russify the population. Estonia and Latvia (for some reason) never expelled the Russians, but have nonetheless put up a lot of barriers to limit the Russians' influence in their countries (by using language tests for citizenship, not granting citizenship to all residents in the country, etc.). Russia hates these barriers and pressures Estonia and Latvia to change them. This makes the relationship between Russia and these states really bad.

Lithuania, on the other hand, never had a really large (&gt;10%) Russian population, so they never had to put up anti-Russian social barriers, and the Russians consequently don't resent them for that.

Yes it is. European conceptualisations of ""Islam"" in public discourse exclusively deal with Arab stereotypes, and Islam is the receptacle into which racism toward Arabs is directed. There is no real difference between the stereotypisation of ""Muslims"" (Arabs) and what you talk about races — or rather, the differences that exist are irrelevant to the discussion, and it's basically a semantic sinkhole to try to defend discrimination with ""BUTBUTBUT it was because I thought he was Muslim, not because of his skin colour!"".

I'm not sure about other places, but I can tell you that almost every basic service that has been privatized in Spain has turned out less efficient, despite all that logic. That's because many times there isn't any alternative for consumers, nor can they realistically choose to not use it.

Perhaps you should look at the history of multicultural vs homogeneous nations and see which ones fare better internally. Even a simple comparison between Portugal and Spain is enough to get an idea. The different cultural groups in Spain, not even being all that diverse, already cause fractions within the nation. Imagine what introducing people from different continents, religions will do to the long term stability of the EU. Also I'm a classical liberal, I could hardly be further from Nazism.

&gt;I'm really too lazy to actually find you a link to Wikipedia explaining what Nazism is, but I suggest you go there and check it out, it's pretty striking in similarity to your views.

Nope, not even close. Just because I agree partially with some parts of Nazi ideology that doesn't mean I'm a Nazi myself. By that logic you would be a Nazi yourself because they also advocated a strong welfare state to help the less fortunate as I think you also do.

&gt;People like you aren't criticising Islamic fundies — you're assuming that all dark-skinned people are Islamic fundies. See how much of a racist prick you are? Nah didn't think so.

You're assuming too much. Do you honestly believe that I think that all dark-skinned people are Islamic fundies or that all Islamic fundies are dark-skinned? For real? I chose Islam because it's a religion that is followed by both whites and blacks, so when people criticize Islam it's clear that they're criticizing a certain culture and not a race like you seem to believe.

&gt;See how much of a racist prick you are? Nah didn't think so.

See how much of a racist prick you paint others to be? Nah didn't think so.

&gt;You know, you're the only one who doesn't want to play with the other kids/cultures.

Lolwut? I'm an aggressor for wanting to preserve a homogeneous Europe instead of embarking in a multicultural experiment just because?

You know how future Europeans will remember you? The same way Africans remember Europeans for not giving a shit when we made up countries in their continent without taking into account ethnicity and culture. To this day multiculturalism in Africa remains a source of strife and now you're importing that model into Europe.

While there have been violences, both from regular citizens and politicians, there is no generalized racist consensus on them. If anything, the French society is very divided on the issue. 

For example when the EU condemned Sarkozy's government for its anti-Rroma policy, two contradictory polls came out. One said 56% of the population approved ([French link](http://www.letelegramme.com/ig/generales/france-monde/france/sondage-sur-les-roms-56-des-francais-donnent-raison-a-l-europe-18-09-2010-1054559.php)), another that 56% (sic) disapproved ([French link](http://www.letelegramme.com/ig/generales/france-monde/france/sondage-56-des-francais-desapprouvent-la-commission-europeenne-16-09-2010-1052307.php)) of the action. Racial polls are forbidden in France, but I think a poll like that gives a good idea of how divided the French population is on this issue.

One thing on which there is a consensus is the dismantling of illegal camps. 80% of the sample ([French link](http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/80-francais-favorables-demantelement-camps-illegaux-roms-mais-73-jugent-mesure-inefficace-sondage-ifop-449314.html)) agree with it.

You can disagree on the methods used to remove them (I sure do) but I don't think anyone would want this kind of settlement in their city. There were measles and tuberculosis in this camp! It basically condemned the whole area, forced businesses to close and gave the neighbourhood a terrible reputation.

The result is that the net change in service quality from an increase in efficiency is often counterbalanced by a magnitude less of resources being put into the system. You do raise a valid point, markets in key sectors are often not competitive, which leads to a governmentally guaranteed monopoly in private hands, this is obviously not fine either. Unfortunately, these sales are being carried out under financial duress, leaving little to no choice. Also note that I did not say that there was no corruption in private enterprises, but these are often connected to the state through special interests. In a public service, the costs of corruption aren't transparent and remain hidden, being paid for by general taxation.

Arbirarily low prices are definitely not fine. Reducing the situation to absurdity highlights why it is so. If everything was free resources would be completely exhausted, despite any type of innate scarcity. You are familiar with Spain, so you should know that the country's national health system has been overused for long, even in situations where there's no illness that warrants it.

true,gocarsno,POLA,Poland,"Your statement that ""all gender differences are small to insignificant"" is a lot stronger than the one put forward by the study you linked:

&gt; Here, the author advances a very different view, the gender similarities hypothesis, which holds that **males and females are similar on most, but not all, psychological variables**. Results from a review of 46 meta-analyses support the gender similarities hypothesis. **Gender differences can vary substantially in magnitude at different ages and depend on the context in which measurement occurs**. 

[emphasis mine]

Of course, gender differences are much smaller than it was assumed historically, or even compared the current media narrative. Obviously, we should be extremely careful about jumping to conclusions about either gender's inherent predispositions in whatever area. Lastly, it also true that imaginary differences are often used by people as an excuse for what is in fact sexist prejudice.

I know all this.

However, I think some people have jumped to the opposite extreme. One may be of the opinion that the observed gender disparities are completely cultural, but the current body of scientific evidence is far from making that certain. Therefore, to treat this as a fact and to call any suggestion of significant contributing biological factors sexist, is dogmatic. You're replacing one kind of narrow-mindedness with another.

Also, in all the wars, no one ever threated with nukes. And boy, the world really, *really* hates wars including nukes. So they can be sure of having absolutely no support from anyone at all.  And, as i said, pretty much everybody knows that.

Seems pretty unorganized to me with a lot of superfluous info.

Unless you have very important and lots of work experience, Education is the most important thing on your resume. In yours, it seems like a sidenote.

Common order in Germany:

1. Personal Info
2. Education
3. Work Experience
4. Other Experience/Extracurricular
5. Skills

Other things:

* List your high school + timeframe + final grade since you do not have a MSc/loads of work experience
* List the start and end (at least month+year) of your studies at Uni
* List the major and final grade for gods sake
* Relevant courses is apparent form your transcript. Shorten it to a few keywords (e.g. Focus: programming, information systems design, business) to describe the BSc. and put it there.
* Skills list is off as well. Programming languages, human languages, software packages you are comfortable using are things to be listed. Public speaking not so much. Organize it more.
* Work experience descriptions are a bit long for my taste, but since you've still got one page it's fine I guess.Since they are not relevant to the position, I'd shorten them and call the section something different.
* Either no photo or a more professional and bigger one, unless you are super confident that this snapshot is appropriate for the position you are applying for. Put on at least a collared white shirt for the photo. For SAP you might even want to put on a full suit w tie.
* Date of Birth is often included, doesn't have to anymore I think.
* Technically, we list things chronologically (not reverse as you do), but I think it's fine either way (I honestly now prefer the english way)
* Place + Date + Signature at the end of it",0,1362784002,null,0,false,0,c8sabii,t3_19xqpc,t1_c8sabii,t3_19xqpc,null,1435572020,16,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,16

&gt;more than 60 projects with a total value of more than DKK 30 million have provided funding in areas such as the environment, care for children and other vulnerable groups, and the development of democracy  

and in 2001 the Nordic Council of Ministers took the initiative for a Nordic-Baltic Campaign Against Trafficking in Women.  You may have heard of trafficked women from the Baltics, we have them regularly turn up here with the thugs that force them into prostitution. Men that we then have to keep in our prisons.

In the case of Spain, the privatizations have been more linked with corruption than with a real need, giving them away very cheap to friends/family, and afterwards getting a juicy position in the company when those politicians leave government.

Also, what you say about low prices is not necessarily true (even without regulation, which obviously should be in place to prevent abuses): healthcare and education, by their nature, can work fine while being free; even some other things like public transport could be made free without those consequences. Of course, I'm not saying that absolutely everything should be free, nor that that would lead to desirable outcomes. Back to the Spanish case, overuse of healthcare was never such a big problem; actually, despite cases where that might have happened, it always was perfectly sustainable and with a comparatively low cost next to many other countries. Spanish public sector wasn't a key piece contributing to the current crisis.

Education and healthcare are prime examples of ballooning costs, as a higher number of students, even those that are just coasting by and represent a low return on investment, requires a higher degree of expenditure. There are limited numbers of professors, classrooms, computer labs, etc. The same is applicable to health care, should a system provide free care to someone that will, in the best scenario, only live 2 more months even though it would cost millions in tax revenue?

Education and healthcare can be managed (and in many places, still are) as well under a free system.

With healthcare, I agree that certain extreme cases should be limited, but it is fundamental for people's well-being that they know they will be able to access it in case of need, no matter their economical situation. The cost of healthcare pre-crisis in Spain didn't grow that much; [here](http://www.escolar.net/wp-content/sanidad-euros4.png)'s the public expenditure on healthcare per citizen and year in some European countries, according to Eurostat 2008, and [here](http://www.escolar.net/wp-content/sanidad-imagen2.png) the expenditure in relation to each country's PIB.

Heathens (non-Jews), slaves, and women are all exempt from at least some of the Commandments. A free Jewish man is responsible for the all the Commandments that are applicable at the time.

Now, about that story regarding muslims praying on the streets, it concerned one particular street, rue Myrha in the historically high-immigrants-mostly-poor-kind-of-shady area of la Goutte d'Or, in Paris.

You have to understand that this is ONE small street (like 10yd wide and 400yd long) in the WHOLE of Paris, and France. I have no knowledge of similar happenings in other cities (maybe Marseille?) The mosque was too small for the normal growth rate of the muslims in the area (understand that there is no invasion, just families growing like other families), the problem had been rampant for a long while, and nothing was done for years to accomodate for it. This is being fixed as of now, with new buldings in the area.

I've been working for the last two years in this exact street, a few dozens meters down from the mosque, and never witnessed a full lockdown of the street as is being described in some news outlets, maybe a bit of animation on some important religious days, and it was rather good spirited.

There is a negative point though, but you'd have to be ignorant or worse to suggest that this is linked to anything else than the general poverty, one has to be careful about his phone in the neighbourhood.

it there are racial or religious tensions, I've never witnessed them, but seriously this whole thing is really really REALLY blown out or proportion. Would you be right to say the US is invaded by illegal Mexicans ? No. Same thing here. Ok, that's way too simplistic, but I hope you get my meaning.

Premièrement je ne suis pas militant à Lyon mais à Paris.

Deuxièmement, les Identitaires ne sont pas le seul groupe présent à Lyon (ni dans le Vieux Lyon d'ailleurs). La Traboule et les Identitaires ne sont pas responsables des ""attaques"" de bar qui peuvent avoir lieu dans le Vieux Lyon. La Traboule est un local ouvert et ne peut être tenu responsable des faits qui se passent dans le voisinage sous prétexte que c'est un local ouvert. 

Le fait est que Rebeyne! et les responsables de La Traboule s'entendent très bien avec leurs voisins et qu'ils ont souvent été victimes d'attaques de la part de ""gauches"".

Cela m'amène à mon dernier point: lorsque l'on se revendique ""chasseur"", ""antifasciste"", etc. et que l'on se livre à des attaques (souvent armées) contre les locaux (vitres cassées, dégradations) et les personnes de ceux d'en face, il faut s'attendre à un retour de bâton.

La Traboule et Rebeyne! ne sont responsables d'aucun acte criminel (c'est ce que les autorités s'évertuent à dire aux ""amoureux de la liberté"" qui veulent les faire interdire), à la différence des ""antifas"", et ils ne sont pas non plus les seuls groupes actifs à Lyon (l'article parle bien de ""hooligans"" d'ailleurs).

* it's a bit lacking details (e.g. the generic ""web development""). I got more information from your reddit history than from your CV.
* time line has a hole between 2010 and 2012. What happened there? Add months to the dates to become a bit more precise. When was the Charity Biking? When did you study? What's your birthday?
* leave out unnessary information - separating blood sounds nice, but is irrelevant for SAP. Handling patients is relevant though if you want to get into Sales.

There is also another reason why they have so much ""Russian"" people (there are many ethnic groups that speak Russia, like Tataars, Kazakhs, Caucasus..) and that is the USSR Military. 

As the Baltic were the west border of USSR, there were massive Red Army troops, Missile units, ICBM's, Air-Force, Baltic Fleet etc. and those ""first line troops"" were mostly Russians. Also because they could keep Baltic nations under tight control, true. But ""*to dilute and Russify the population deliberately*"" is not 100% true.

Baltic nations suffer from the same thing as Russia (and west...) and that is low birth rates and big brain drain. Birthrates are:

Estonia 1.64
Latvia 1.41
Lithuania 1.41
Russia 1.44
(Finland 1.84, USA 2.07, India 2.74...)

And when a big amount of people is emigrating to west (better salary etc.), they got a tax problem, pension problem, too much people to support than people who work and pay incomes to the government etc.

Russian government tries to get Russian people back to Russia from Baltic by even bribing. But they are not that stupid, rather stay in a EU and Nato country than go over the border to Putinistan where the shit is really thick and smelly...

And that's the thing with the adoption scandals between USA and Russia: the message is to Russians that don't go out the country, don't give children to be adopted over boards, we need our future Soldiers and Mechanics!

Just to say, even Italy and Japan has a lower birthrate than Baltics (1.38 / 1.32)...

true,FrenchyDude,null,null,"An unbiased opinion on muslims from ""AtheistAgnostic"" ;)              
But seriously, there is a bit of truth and a bit of over-mediatisation.             
The truth is that there are some people who are muslims and will act like what you've seen on the ""muslim patrol"" videos in london, not that bad, but they are dicks, and it's not really the religion that is the problem (it is part of it), but more the customs. Some people come from a third world country where violence is often necessary, food is scarce and a huge majority is muslim. There are many many differences between the cultures (ex: you never pay anything full price and always haggle, everywhere)             

Because of that shitty life condition, they usually come/came to France with the whole family, and go back to see the family left in their country every other summer (which then gets tempted to come too). The family elders often keep the same rules for their families as what they were used to, meaning that the cultural clash is still present, and they are not integrated in the society, they stand out and form some micro-societies.         
As everywhere else, we have those tall tower in shitty neighborhoods, and in some places, they are almost all muslims. That might be partially because people did not like what the place was becoming, or because they tried to rat out to the police that they're selling hash/weed most of the time. And business is booming, they make tons of money, and it's a whole new economy that hires every young people in the blocks to be their eyes, and sometimes their soldiers (many place are off-limits to the police, or they'll get beat up/thrown rocks and other things..).     
In the city I live in, the police do not have the right to go in that neighborhood, since they know it will end badly, they have order from up in the hierarchy not to approach that place. There are constantly at least 30 people at all times, dealing, and if the police comes they'll know it even before they're near the place, will hide their stuff, and the place is suddently crowded with young people with their faces covered up, preparing and looking towards the entrance of the neighborhood. (I've seen it before they stopped trying to shut this place down).                
I have known of this place for 6 years and there has not been a succesful police operation, they tried a few times and never got anything, except a beating. The only thing they do is try to catch people a bit down the road that come back from there with their hash.              
If you're still reading this, you must think this place is a warzone, and it looks like one (always a few stripped cars and a fire in a barrel or somewhere), but the crazy and weird thing is that it's a business and they know it. They are friendly as fuck, as long as they have no doubt you're legit. I have a few female friends that went and still go there regularly, and never had one problem/remark/inapropriate anything.           
Not many people want to live near that anyways, and they are very suspicious of white people living there that might rat on them/help the police. Many non-muslim leave the place because of that, the noise of scooters all night/day long, cars coming in until 3 am, and it's mostly become a muslim-only place, in which they live as they would have back in their country, which only deepens the gap between them and the rest of the french society. 
If you are from maghreb yourself and live in this place, you must live by their laws. You can not be seen eating during ramadan, be seen with a white boyfriend (that was me at the time..), and many other things I don't have a clue about :/                
If you're a whitey just going to buy your weed, they will welcome you as well trained sellers, acting like friends.             
It currently is a huge problem in our country. It's happening in every city, and the police are fighting a battle that's lost in advance. And instead of  talking about that and facing the flaws there are in our country (a flaw that created a whole economy and society), the only thing on the news is some footage of the police in a fight with them from times to times, often showing large groups of muslims throwing rocks and molotovs at police cars or trains or whatever.          
Enough footage like that, and you've quickly got an increase in the people who vote on the exteme right wing (nationalist party?). Apparently, seeing colored people throwing rocks and destroying things made the gap even bigger between the two cultures, but it is understandable from both sides.                 
A muslim (or maghreb immigrants) comes to france to avoid living in crappy conditions (violence, lack of nurrishment, bad/Dangerous environment for children,..), finds himself with no education, no experience (except selling hash), some problems adapting culturally-speaking, an accent/bad grammar, and colored skin (which the employer has seen on the news and now associates with violent hooligans, when in his eyes, he was only doing his job, protecting the stash, and protecting his (illegal) income). He has not one chance to find a job, maybe a few decades ago but unemployement is a big problem at the moment, so he does what most would do, goes back to his old job. He's with his buddies all day long, smoking weed and selling, and would have to get hired as a doctor to make as much money..                 
                      
So please, don't trust the french news. I watch the news only to compare to what reddit/other sources told me, and i'm yelling at my TV 3 out of 4 times..              
               
Sorry, I got a bit side tracked..             
I think I saw the video of the muslims outside the mosque praying in Paris, never seen it happen in person (I don't live in paris, but visit quite often). I personnally don't believe it's a really frequent thing (can only be 2 times in the day anyways, at 6 I think)).             
Here we have ""La libertée de religion"" (religion freedom) that is not a law but a liberty, and it is very well guarded, since it can be a touchy subject. I don't think a large group of people reuniting/blocking the road or sidewalk to pray is allowed by law, but religion freedom is more important than the other law.. I suppose it is a bit of a grey area.. But that freedom of religion also means you are free to choose no religion (or a different one), meaning there should not be something that can offend you in public places, you can not go to school with a cross or a burkha or something religious and that can be seen. in recent years, there was a law that was passed making the burkha illegal in the street (where you are allowed to have a little cross I think.. but it gets confusing..).              
IMO, most of the people you saw praying are probably the patriarch (fathers?)) of the families, they are culturally different, but not dangerous, and should be treated as any other religious people.                
        
Source for most of this : I had a maroccan girlfriend for a long time, been to marroco, ..              
             
tl;dr : I tried, it ended up writing another book..                
- Don't trust the news, most are sensionalists/will not talk about important subject and try to mold you.               
- There are lots of cultural differences, and most immigrants found a flaw in the system to get money/power.                    
- I think the praying in the street is kind of a grey area, or at least too risky to disturb.                      

              
             
I am usually the one that says ""never generalize"", and I know that does not represent the whole muslim and/or immigrant community. It's just that the part that integrated normally into the french society is just french. It is hard to change the way you've lived all these years, especially when the country you're in does not really help you (""we're going through some tought shit right now, come back later""). There is a small portions that manages to get perfectly integrated, and that is mostly comprised of young people. My morrocan ex (moved to france when she was 13) quickly saw the way the french lived and gave up on religion shortly after she arrived, wanted to eat a bit anyways during ramadan, and many things like that, but could not unless she was absolutely sure that there was not one person looking (hard when there are 500 windows near you).

Coverage is good, plans are decent and the customer service is one of the best I know (amazon-like). Smartphone plans start at 20 Eur a month and go up to 45, depending on how much data you plan to use (20 gives you a mere 50MB, 45 a whopping 5GB) at full speed. after that is used up, you have throttled speed but don't pay extra. national texts and calls are included.

They also have other plans that are cheaper or without any monthly fee, but then you pay for calls/texts (obviously), just have a look around.

Other large carriers would be E-Plus and T-Mobile. The latter tends to be a bit more expensive though, had a tad bitter coverage in some areas.

There are loads of low-cost carriers as well, [Lidl-Talk](http://www.lidl.de/de/Smart-Tarif) may be an interesting one for you as they offer a good smartphone plan on the o2 network for 10 Eur. That gives you 300MB data and 400 minutes and/or texts (9c per text/min afterwards). If you do not plan to go above and beyond the 400 units, this is probably the best and cheapest you can get.

One note about the coverage (having experienced AT&amp;T in the us):
Coverage in Germany is amazing compared to the US. Unless you hang around in a tunnel or somewhere in the middle of nowhere (like somewhere in a valley in the alps) you will have decent coverage. So I wouldn't worry about that too much.

If you tend to be located in the same area a lot, we have something called Homezone in Germany. This is an area of a certain diameter around an adress you choose when buying the plan. In this area, you are reachable via a landline-number and often pay lower rates or nothing at all for calls into the carrier network and/or landline.
See if the plans you are looking for has this feature. It can be quite neat.

Bottomline: I'd go with the LIDL-Talk thing if you don't mind no-frills service. Otherwise, my personal recommendation is O2.",0,1362813105,null,0,false,0,c8shhj5,t3_19yeuj,t1_c8shhj5,t3_19yeuj,null,1431530257,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

This year's theme from the UN is “A promise is a promise: Time for action to end violence against women”

Much progress has happened over the last few decades. Today, there are international agreements and treaties specifically aimed at giving women and girls the respect, dignity, choices and freedom that every human being should enjoy. Important steps have been taken globally and regionally to end violence against women. More than 125 countries have specific laws that penalize domestic violence. Still, 603 million women live in countries where it is not considered a crime.

The new millennium has witnessed a significant change and attitudinal shift in both women's and society's thoughts about women's equality and emancipation. Many from a younger generation feel that 'all the battles have been won for women' while many feminists from the 1970's know only too well the longevity and ingrained complexity of patriarchy. With more women in the boardroom, greater equality in legislative rights, and an increased critical mass of women's visibility as impressive role models in every aspect of life, one could think that women have gained true equality. The unfortunate fact is that women are still not paid equally to that of their male counterparts, women still are not present in equal numbers in business or politics, and globally women's education, health and the violence against them is worse than that of men.

However, great improvements have been made. We do have female astronauts and prime ministers, school girls are welcomed into university, women can work and have a family, women have real choices.

* Heathens, because they are not the Children of Israel, are responsible only for the covenant God made with Noah (the Noahide laws), not for the covenant God made with Abraham (the Commandments).

* Slaves are waived from fulfilling certain ritual duties for a reason I can't remember right now. The point is that there are some commandments they don't have to follow.

* Women are waived from commandments that have to be done at a certain time of day. Because their duties as a wife and mother cannot be interrupted for prayer (which should indicate to you the priority Judaism places on the family and the mother in particular), they are exempted from fulfilling commandments that would otherwise be interrupted by their daily duties. (I think, actually, that the same rationale applies for slaves: a slave is exempted from rituals that must be done at a specific time of day so that their obligations to their master are not unfulfilled.)

So halb. Aktuelle Drohnen fliegen halbautonom, d.h. die Piloten geben z.B. Wegpunkte auf einer Karte vor und die Drohne fliegt dann von selbst dorthin. Der Grund ist dass für einer echte 1:1-Steuerung die Signallaufzeiten z.B. zwischen Arizona und Afghanistan (und das über ein paar Satelliten) zu lang sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht ändern lassen, weil das Problem die Lichtgeschwindigkeit ist (das musste [Grace Hopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) Militärs auch oft erklären).

Also wird die Entwicklung zu mehr Autonomie gehen, bis man dann eine Situation hat in der man ein Zielgebiet auswählt, und die Drohne startet. Die kreist dann darüber und meldet dann alles das, was ihr bekämpfungswürdig erscheint: Der Operator sieht dann die Sensordaten und trifft eine ja/nein-Entscheidung. Die Drohen bekämpft dann eigenständig das Ziel (derzeit muss ein Operator immer noch so einen Lasermarkierer auf das Terrroristenauto (oder das was man dafür hält) draufhalten). Die menschliche Entscheidung ist aus ethischen Gründen wichtig, aber auch weil kein Softwarehersteller verantwortlich sein will (wie es auch beim autonomen Fahren von Autos der Fall ist).

Manche Menschen zeichnen eine Horrorvision, in der manche Akteure (müssen keine Staaten sein) die Autonomie vervollständigen, weil sie keine ethischen Hemmungen haben, um damit die Oberhand z.B. im Luftkampf Drohnen gegen Drohe zu haben. Damit haben dann auch die Guten™ ein Argument den Menschen aus der Befehlskette zu nehmen usw.

Ho quindi provato il test d'ingresso, un po' per sfida personale e un po' con la vaga idea di buttarmi sulla ricerca medica.

Test che è andato bene, come quelli per biologia e ingegneria. E alla fine mi sono iscritta a medicina, dato che mi dispiaceva sprecare quel risultato.

Dopo il primo mese di fisica e chimica, cominciano le seghe mentali e la voglia di cambiare inizia ad aumentare: ma come riuscirò a studiare le materie più propriamente mediche senza dover convivere con la sensazione che ogni ora che non dedico allo studio è un danno subito dai miei futuri pazienti, sensazione che già irrazionalmente provo studiando chimica? E l'anatomia, la fisiologia, le patologie mi interessano davvero? Perché vorrei essere al posto dei miei amici che devono dare analisi 1, piuttosto che studiare in modo mnemonico chimica organica? Ma lo voglio veramente fare il medico, e anteporre i problemi dei miei pazienti ai miei?

Al momento ho appena iniziato il secondo semestre e di fatto l'unico corso che offre un po' di varietà (dato che nel frattempo ho capito che è proprio la varietà nelle materie che studio che mi ha sempre aiutato nell'andare bene a scuola; il liceo scientifico, con il suo equilibrio fifty-fifty tra materie scientifiche e umanistiche, è stata la scuola ideale per me) è statistica.

Per farla breve, mi sono resa conto di: 1. Non volere studiare per altri 10 anni, soprattutto qualcosa di così mnemonico come medicina. 2. Non volermi caricare sulle spalle la responsabilità - per me troppo grande - della vita di altre persone. 3. Non essere poi così interessata alla ricerca, inizialmente la mia 'via di fuga' da un'attività medica più clinica. 4. Preferire un corso di laurea più variegato e 'leggero' dal punto di vista dell'orario e dell'ambiente, e che soprattutto rispecchi maggiormente i miei interessi (vedi anche la risposta che ho dato a _Dodecahedron_).

Sto anche vedendo uno psicologo, per cercare di uscire dal tunnel di 'torpore mentale' in cui sono finita e che mi sta impedendo di prendere una scelta oggettiva sul mio futuro.",0,1362823625,null,0,false,0,c8sit0m,t3_19wz2w,t1_c8sit0m,t1_c8shb17,null,1435571703,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

I should have explained this part better. Politicians use this topic to get easy votes from the less informed and sometimes racist parts of their electorate.

&gt; Yeah, it sucks that you can't travel and find a better place to work, but to be fair, the citizens of these countries have paid taxes for generations to support their nation which would be placed under a large strain from an influx of immigrants which lower wages and erode working conditions and possibly strain welfare systems as well.

&gt;In the end the whole idea of nation states and borders could be considered 'racist' but ultimately the people living there have contributed and they don't want to see their living standards fall.

These states admitted Romania in the EU. This had good consequences on their economy - they had access to a new market, Romania had to give up on some protectionist policies.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States

&gt; In 1907, Indiana passed the first eugenics-based compulsory sterilization law in the world. Thirty U.S. states would soon follow their lead.[45][46] Although the law was overturned by the Indiana Supreme Court in 1921,[47] the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a Virginia law allowing for the compulsory sterilization of patients of state mental institutions in 1927.[48]

&gt; [...]

&gt; Some states sterilized ""imbeciles"" for much of the 20th century. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1927 Buck v. Bell case that the state of Virginia could sterilize those it thought unfit. Although compulsory sterilization is now considered an abuse of human rights, Buck v. Bell was never overturned, and Virginia did not repeal its sterilization law until 1974.[49] The most significant era of eugenic sterilization was between 1907 and 1963, when over 64'000 individuals were forcibly sterilized under eugenic legislation in the United States.

&gt; [...]

&gt; Men and women were compulsorily sterilized for different reasons. Men were sterilized to treat their aggression and to eliminate their criminal behavior, while women were sterilized to control the results of their sexuality.

&gt; A 1937 Fortune magazine poll found that 2/3 of respondents supported eugenic sterilization of ""mental defectives"", **63% supported sterilization of criminals, and only 15% opposed both**. Native American women were also victims of sterilization abuse up into the 1970s.

&gt; One of the methods that was commonly suggested to get rid of ""inferior"" populations was euthanasia. A 1911 Carnegie Institute report mentioned euthanasia as one of its recommended ""solutions"" to the problem of cleansing society of unfit genetic attributes. **The most commonly suggested method was to set up local gas chambers.** However, many in the eugenics movement did not believe that Americans were ready to implement a large-scale euthanasia program, so many doctors had to find clever ways of subtly implementing eugenic euthanasia in various medical institutions. For example, a mental institution in Lincoln, Illinois fed its incoming patients milk infected with tuberculosis (reasoning that genetically fit individuals would be resistant), resulting in 30-40% annual death rates. Other doctors practiced eugenicide through various forms of lethal neglect.

Latin script was made for the latin language originally, where the Cyrillic was made from the script created by two Greek monks, who wished to spread Christianity to the Slavs. They tailored an alphabet to the Slavic languages.

true,Mishulo,null,null,"io ti posso solo dire la mia personale esperienza, che magari ti può essere illuminante più di tante pippe di altri che non hanno vissuto la realtà della facoltà di medicina.  
Mi sono iscritto nel 2003, ho fatto il primo esame (fisica) studiando pochissimo e prendendo 24. ne è seguito un 23 a chimica. per uno che al liceo è uscito con la media sopra il 9.5 è stato la riprova che qualcosa non andava. comunque ho proseguito: secondo semestre, istologia 28, tentato 3 volte biologia e alla fine a luglio ne sono uscito zoppicante. morale della favola, mentre i miei amici in altre facoltà erano soddisfatti di quello che facevano e trovavano tempo di fare quel che volevano, io arrancavo sempre.

al secondo anno ho quasi lasciato la facoltà per colpa di anatomia II. il mio prof di anatomia, sapendo questa cosa, mi ha contattato e mi ha chiesto di venire a parlare da lui. sono stato mezz'ora a parlare, a dire tutte le cose che hai detto te, a dire che non mi sentivo un bravo studente e che non ero fatto per la medicina e che avrei trovato più successo come ingegnere o come qualunque altra cosa. il prof mi disse che anche lui, 40 anni prima, s'era trovato in una situazione simile alla mia, senza i miei tristi voti ma comunque con la sensazione di aver preso la strada sbagliata... e poi, tutto a un tratto, ecco l'illuminazione e aveva iniziato a marciare come un treno.

tornai a casa quella sera dicendomi che tanto non aveva senso mollare tutto a metà anno, e a marzo ricominciai le lezioni con lo stesso senso di inadeguatezza. ma poi ecco le lezioni di fisiologia, ed i tasselli che cominciano a combaciare, la voglia di imparare e di capire perché siamo fatti così, a che serve tutto quello che c'è nel corpo... e da lì in avanti non è stata sicuramente tutta discesa, ma la voglia di andarmene non c'è più stata, e ogni giorno ho ringraziato i consigli di quel prof. Quando è venuto a mancare è stato il tracollo peggiore dei miei anni di università.

Medicina, imparerai col tempo se continuerai su questa strada, non è affatto mnemonica. è l'arte di saper interpretare i segni e i sintomi, l'arte di saper scegliere in un momento se è meglio fare A o fare B, l'arte di saper capire quello che spesso vuole sentire la gente.  
la responsabilità della vita dei pazienti è tua come di chiunque altro, col particolare che tu puoi essere quella che sa trattare il tizio che si sente male al cinema o in metropolitana; e più che del peso della ""responsabilità della vita"" degli altri, pensa anche al fatto che con ogni atto medico sacrifichi un po' del tuo tempo per dare tempo a quell'altra persona. ed è una cosa bellissima.  
puoi essere medico e non fare ricerca. ce ne sono tanti, anche nell'ambiente universitario, che preferiscono solo lavorare per i 5 anni di specializzazione ed uscire con il titolo, e poi lavorare come specialisti per il resto della loro vita; se vuoi o non vuoi fare ricerca sta a te.

I live in Marseille where there is be the biggest immigrant (and immigrant's descents) population in France (with Paris' suburbs). Most of the immigrants come from North Africa, some of them are muslims. Most of them live in the poorest areas of the city, where unemployment and insecurity are high. Knowing this, people from the far right make the connexion muslim -&gt; insecurity. But the real problem of those areas (and most areas with insecurity problems) is definitely not islam, it is poverty.

Street prayers is only a very small part of the debate. The explanation of this problem is that Catholicism has been the only religion in France for centuries, so there's thousands of churches in the whole country. It was only in 1905 that Church and State were separated. At that time, it was written in the law that the State would not help to build any religious building anymore. North African immigration arrived only a few decades later (after WWII). Some of them were muslims, but there was no Mosques in France, and the law forbids the State of helping them to build one. 

The problem is exactly the same today. There are only a few mosques in France, and no money to build new ones. As there are way too many muslims to fit in the few French mosques, some of them end up praying outside the building. A big mosque is planned to be built in Marseille soon, but it will cost €22M to build, and the financing far from being ready...

Of course it is not over, and it is still not over. It is not over until it is no longer talked about. Fact of the matter is however that we do have equal opportunity when it comes to gender. You don't need to make legislation to favour either group now. It will happen naturally.

&gt;Speaking of racism, people didn't just wait for that to end. They stood up against it and pushed it down, which is good, because we don't have so much of it today. The same goes for gender equality.

As I said, it takes time and people dying and getting born. You need to replace the people who lived in the old world with people who live in the new.

I think people are pretty aware. It is not like people are going to suddenly forget treating someone worse due to their gender is a bad thing if they already have that as a core moral value. This will happen naturally as the laws get enforced and taught. You don't need to go out in a 'holier than thou' fashion and try to teach people who would probably be more suitable to teach you.

&gt;Years ago I was very skeptical and critical of many feminist issues. I didn't have to die to come around.

'Feminist' as a term is so broad it is meaningless. I don't know if you are talking about fake issues, actual issues, misrepresented issues, or anything. Feminism - large and ill-defined as it is - has a lot of issues, some of which I probably will agree with, but that is not because I change, that's because they actually raise a real issue for a change.

&gt;No, not ""too bad"". Like I said, anti-racists didn't just go ""too bad"" and wait racism out. If they had, we wouldn't be where we are today.

Yes they did. Your view of reality is absolutely flawed. The new generations build the future and the old generations wish to preserve what they have built. It is not often that you can turn the ideals of an older generation around - in fact almost never - rather you have to target the new generation, educate them your point of view and the new world, so when the old generation dies off racism/sexism/whatever issue is less prevalent.

&gt;Difensori del sistema

E' un non sequitur, soprattutto sulla questione Briatore, che non è né candidato né ha ricevuto endorsement di alcun tipo da Grillo. La ""casta"" non sarà un problema in se, ma la corruzione, l'evasione fiscale e l'abuso di potere lo sono. Altro che secondario, partono i miliardi per queste cose.

&gt;Fagocitosi dei movimenti di estrema destra

Nulla di nuovo. Meglio un comico abbraccia-alberi che il primo coglione che usa indifferentemente patriottismo/nazionalismo per giustificare idee molto spesso retrogradi. 

&gt;Digital Divide

Condivisibile, anche se mio padre ultrasessantenne pur avendo difficoltà all'inviare una mail con allegato, riesce comunque ad usare internet per leggere di politica.
E non sono di certo in una zona agiata per quanto riguarda il cablaggio della rete.

&gt;Grillo di destra - Leader

Solo perché utilizza la spettacolarizzazione delle sue azioni questo lo rende di destra? 
Paradossalmente è quanto di più vicino al comunismo che l'Italia abbia mai avuto, almeno per quanto riguarda certe finezze a livello ideologico. 
inb4 foto di Grillo dal film Scemo di Guerra spacciato per cosplay del ventennio. Film carino, ma Beppe recita da cani.

&gt;Industria Entertainment/Marketing

Dimentica che Grillo ha più volte tranciato brutalmente il rapporto con il passato, rinnegandolo alle volte (la pubblicità yomo ad esempio o i suoi spettacoli per la televisione). Grillo è stato assente per anni dalla televisione (il suo ultimo spettacolo ricordo di averlo visto in replica all'età di 9 anni), ha lavorato con il teatro, si è schierato a favore di movimenti ambientalisti. Accomunare la satira fascistoide di Striscia la Notizia e Grillo è un azzardo.

&gt;Questione capo

E' verissimo: il capo del M5S è l'allegra combriccola Grillo/Casaleggio. Hanno scritto a tavolino delle regole, se ti piacciono bene altrimenti nessuno ti obbliga a candidarti. La questione purghe però è molto diversa. Favia è stato cacciato perché, al secondo mandato, voleva fare il furbetto ad esempio (c'è anche una questione con il suo compenso da eletto, era contrario ad una riduzione di quella portata, ma non sono sicuro e non trovo una buona fonte per questo). Andrebbe analizzato caso per caso, troppo facile generalizzare così. Ci sono state persone rifiutate per i rapporti con la massoneria, gente che si è appropriata del logo impropriamente e così via.

E poi boh, non lo so. Tante cose si possono criticare del Movimento 5 Stelle (mancanza di un programma economico definito, mancanza di una vera bussola che non sia Grillo, nessuna parola sui diritti civili eccetera), vanno a prendere i punti più stupidi?

You cannot apply this same reasoning when the port is privatised. In essence, the public forgoes its own share of the profits to help increase the profits of a private corporation. 

So, who owns the port is very relevant to the situation. And quit comparing me with a conspiracy theorist. I'm arguing using facts. In the long run, the state cannot possibly benifit in the end by forgoing its own share of the profits (taxes et al) all the time and hoping that foreign investment will take care of everything.

This is not true. I think you mean that periods of growth alternating with periods of recession are inherent in a capitalist economic system. Even so, recessions are not caused necessarily by financial bubbles. And right now there is no 'excessive money supply'.

&gt;It is always there, 


It's not. This is why we have the crysis, because the money supply is not there anymore.

&gt;Real estate is the most obvious investment


It's just one of the possible investments. It's not even the easiest investment to make. Before ~2000 people didn't think about their houses as investments. Reals Estate is an investment for property developers. They buy land, build houses and sell them. But that does not make it a bubble. 

&gt;that's why it features prominently in many financial bubbles. 

There was exactly one housing bubble, the one that burst in 2008. It was caused by easy access to mortgages for people who otherwise should have never owned a house in the first place.

Some general advice though: Find some people to speak to (internet! Skype!). Studying grammar and vocabulary is great, but won't help you all that much until you learn it in the right contexts. You need to listen to natural German a lot (not that unnatural listening comprehension crap that most textbooks have). That also means, never watch American movies with German dub for practice - the issues they talk about are not German, the social standards are not German, and because of the restrictions given by lip movement, rhythm and pauses are super unnatural and not helpful if you're trying to learn the language. Read stuff. Listen to people. Talk a lot.
If your level is still beginner/intermediate, learn to NOT use your dictionary when you want to say something. It stops the conversational flow if you're talking to someone, and the chance that you're finding a word that just won't work in the context is pretty high (I always know when my students use their dictionaries to write essays). Learn to describe things with the words you already know. When you're reading/listening to German, memorize the words being used, including the context. Learn to express complex thoughts with simple terms. Be prepared for struggling with expression your identity with limited language skills, and be patient.

The rationale behind tinkering with the interest rate is to allow for the opportunity cost of investing to become less prohibitive. While you claim that this would lead to an artificially low interest rate, the fact that a traditional central bank exists in the first place guarantees that this will be the case regardless. So, the issue isn't whether the rate is ""artificially low"", but rather if it makes sense when comparing GDP with potential GDP. In the case of Europe, it's clear that GDP has fallen bellow potential GDP for quite a while and the economy is not even close to overheating such that some sort of stimuli would make sense. 

Inflation is essential in the adjustment of prices and wages during economic cycles and attempts to contain inflation within arbitrary bounds, despite the existence of attenuating circumstances, is fairly short sighted. It's essentially a trade-off between the speed of adjustment and price stability, when not taken to the extreme.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;The rationale behind tinkering with the interest rate is to allow for the opportunity cost of investing to become less prohibitive.

That isn't necessarily good, the money we do earn is going to be spent, people don't work to hoard it under their mattresses, if not now, later.

To keep the interest rates too low, people miscalculate the risk and start investing in other things which may prove not worthwhile, you do can end up with crisis like the housing bubble which was caused by the very low interest rates.

&gt;While you claim that this would lead to an artificially low interest rate, the fact that a traditional central bank exists in the first place guarantees that this will be the case regardless.

You're right, and it's not like it's easy to calculate an interest rate, I mean, even without a central bank (like the Austrians advocate), it's not like the interest rates would fluctuate much across the world, not with all the other central banks that exist in other countries and with the few restrictions on the movement of capital we and so many other countries have.

But still, to claim that ""low interest rates = good"", no, that's silly, interest rates are the cost of money over time, to think we'd all get a free lunch if we tried to control this price and keep it artificially low, that's wrong, it doesn't work like that.

&gt;So, the issue isn't whether the rate is ""artificially low"", but rather if it makes sense when comparing GDP with potential GDP.

I still fail to see the reasoning behind that. The short term GDP would go up with lower interest rates but that would be less money we'd have to invest in the long run, it's not like we'd all benefit from interest rates reaching 0%.

&gt;In the case of Europe, it's clear that GDP has fallen bellow potential GDP for quite a while and the economy is not even close to overheating such that some sort of stimuli would make sense. 

I personal find that whole ""potential"" vs ""real"" GDP to be quite dubious, that's basically picking up a graph between the different points of GDP and drawing a line in between and saying ""this was an expansion and this was a recession"", that hardly says anything.

Anyway, yes, the GDP has fallen, that happens when you have a sovereign debt crisis. Let's fix that, let's keep government spending and taxation at a minimum and allow the economy to flourish again without the severe restriction imposed on it by the governmental authorities.

&gt;Inflation is essential in the adjustment of prices and wages during economic cycles and attempts to contain inflation between arbitrary values, despite the existence of attenuating considerations, is fairly short sighted. It's essentially a trade-off between the speed of adjustment and price stability, when not taken to the extreme. 

Inflation is caused by the printing of money, to think that our problems would be fixed if we turned the printing presses on, that's what's short-sighted.

Sure, you could use monetary policy - expand the money supply, drive interest rates down and increase the GDP by allowing for more investment and consumption, I mean, it's would be only some inflation, right? But would it actually solve the root of our problems? Or would it just be delaying them further into the future while pretending everything was solved? Because it seems to me you aren't solving anything, because they're trying just that in the USA and they don't seem to be improving whereas we in Europe and going through harder times now but are keeping our currency valuable and not taxing everybody all at once and destroying savings like the Americans do whenever they print more dollars.

&gt;Now, this is not to say that building roads in the periphery would be wise, but she does have a point in that stimulus is required to smooth the current account imbalances within the monetary union.

Between thinking that our problems will be solved by increasing public spending and thinking they'll be solved by lowering interest rates, both arguments fail to look at the outcome, people who advocate that go ""but it will increase employment"" or ""but it will increase economic growth"" but never mention at what cost, they completely ignore the opportunity cost, they never say ""even though it will require higher taxes that will decrease employment in the near future"" or ""even though it will consume capital that will decrease economic growth in the near future"".

So while there is some logic in promoting economic development in times of recession either by using an expansionary fiscal policy like Sócrates did with his building of roads or by using an expansionary monetary policy like Lagarde and you are arguing for with your printing of money, do keep in mind that there's no such thing as a free lunch, that this all comes at a cost and that these half-baked measures certainly won't get us out of the crisis we're in and will most definitely delay our recovery, so if we do are to implement them, let's at least think about them properly, saying ""austerity bad, interest rates too high, hurr durr we need more government in the economy"" is certainly not the way to do it.",1,1362852494,null,0,false,0,c8snez0,t3_19yz6c,t1_c8snez0,t1_c8smp8v,null,1431533126,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,triceratopos,null,null,"Of course people don't want to hoard, low interest rates imply that the opportunity cost of holding cash increases. That's precisely the point, kickstarting a system that's been frozen by lack of confidence as well as other issues.

I've never said that low interest rates were good, they are neutral. They are useful in certain circumstances, just like high interest rates. This ties with the other point I mentioned, the point is to allow GDP to reach equilibrium faster. You see, there's really no point in having prolonged and painful adjustments. It's not about the interest rate being at a magical spot that doesn't even exist. Rather, it's about what the real economy needs to adjust, be it 0% or 10% (I mentioned that high interest rates are as important as low interest rates, I never advocated low interest rates by default).

The difference between potential and actual GDP highlights that there's room for improving output, which is being squandered. It might be no golden rule, but it reflects which way the pendulum is swinging. While your suggestion would theoretically work if you look at it from the supply-side, it's clear that these governments are in need of cash infusions NOW. What you describe, if it works, has a lagged effect on the economy, it might be more effective, but it's not feasible given social and political constraints.

I never advocated turning on any printing presses, let alone something akin to seigniorage. The point is that this one size fits all monetary policy is broken at the country level and inflation would be unlikely to run rampant with such high levels of unemployment. Also, the US has been doing significantly better than the Eurozone, even having posted 2+ pp growth per quarter. Your other point is fair and I have argued in other threads that inflation would be little more than a convenient tool for profligate governments and, subsequently a wealth redistribution from society to the corrupt. This other extreme is obviously not desirable, but neither is the current we've been riding.

Your last point is little more than rhetoric, there's no obvious connection between lowering interest rates to increase the speed of adjustment (something that's been done since the dawn of modern central banking) and incurring in debt. You're essentially assuming that any increase in the money supply will lead to malinvestment and future recessions, which is more than a stretch. Additionally, what is the opportunity cost of a generation of unemployable, subsidizing other countries though emmigration and eroding skills? Yeah, it's not exactly black and white. Socrates' expansionary fiscal policy is the opposite of something that is rooted in logic, it's the definition of malinvestment. Interest rates, on the other hand are market-based mechanisms for resource allocation. It's not about any free lunch, nobody believes that a larger CB asset sheet implies prosperity, it's about smoothing adjustments. Nothing else.
