true,Helkafen,null,null,"&gt; L'article parle très justement de ceux qui vivent dans des parcs et qui n'ont que faire des pseudo richesses crées par ta silicon valley, puisqu'ils n'en profitent absolument pas. Ils vivent moins bien que mes chasseurs cueilleurs.

Pseudo-richesses? Ils ont juste créé la plus grande source de connaissance au monde, quasiment gratuite pour le monde entier. Et aujourd'hui, ils s'appuient sur le séquençage du génome (à un coût modique) pour prévenir toutes les maladies ayant une cause génétique. Tout ça en 30 ans (!).

L'article précise bien que le quartier pauvre gagne son pain en travaillant pour les riches propriétaires. Ils profitent donc bien de cette richesse. Ce n'est pas l'eldorado, certes, mais je suis convaincu qu'ils vivent mieux que les serfs du moyen age comme le dit un commentateur. Si l'un d'eux a une carie, son dentiste aura une anesthésie pour le soigner sans douleur. Les progrès ont été tels depuis un siècle qu'on ne se rend plus compte de ce que l'on a.

Maintenant il ne faut pas se leurrer. Quand on est passé de 100 millions à 6 milliards d'humains, les besoins ont largement augmenté. L'agriculture intensive demande plus de travail, le logement devient plus difficile à construire, la santé est précaire à cause des épidémies. Il faut produire beaucoup de richesses pour supporter une telle population. Pas besoin d'invoquer une destruction de richesse (laquelle?) pour expliquer la pauvreté de certains.

Ne ratons pas le point essentiel de l'article : le fond de l'affaire concerne l'automatisation de la production. Avec toutes ces machines (ordinateurs et robots), plus de la moitié des emplois sont sur le point de devenir obsolètes. Si on ne change rien, on aura une production de biens suffisante pour combler tous les besoins minimaux et superficiels, mais pas de salaires pour les payer. Il faut changer ce système de fond en comble, et ce n'est pas en pleurnichant sur une minorité qu'on résoudra le problème de la majorité.

... That would reduce the demand for labor and increase unemployment.

&gt;You're still ignoring the fact that those immigrants provide better work for less pay, and the market actively asks for them. 

Not better, or they would be able to enter as expats already. Cheaper, undoubtedly: that's why I say open borders will cause a drop in wages across the board. Obviously ""the market"" (read: big corp) asks for a policy that would decrease wages.

&gt;And the countries that loosened their immigration policies did not instantly become unlivable hellholes. In fact they tend to be rather nice places to live in.

You were talking about lifting *all* restrictions. Give examples.

&gt;And if they actually make the effort of getting all the way to your country, 

That's less a matter of effort than of available funds. The poorest of the world aren't able to afford the trip.

&gt;they're willing to do the jobs that the citizens abhor, 

There's mass unemployment already, also among new immigrants. There is no labor shortage, no matter what big corp tells you.

&gt;there's no proof that they have any sort of negative impact on the economy overall, so... why kick them out?

I'm not kicking them out. I'm saying: make sure they can find a place before letting them in.

&gt;We're in a financial crysis, dude. Unemployment was way higher before 2008, while the immigration rate saw only a small increase that in no way can explain the sudden lack of jobs.

And? Unemployment is unemployment. Your ""we need labor"" argument falls flat on its face.

&gt;Then stop thinking of them or treating them as untermenschen. 

You're the one who is advocating to give them less rights than the citizens. I want everyone in a country to have the same rights and have the same access to civil services. Importing a class of maids and servants for the Herrenvolk is unacceptable for me.

&gt;They need to come to your country

Only doable for people that are well off already.

&gt;they're willing to do the shittiest work possible to live in your country

Look at the unemployment numbers! THERE. IS. NO. LABOR. SHORTAGE.

&gt;and you want to revoke the untermensch status by sending them back to the villages where people starve and die by the age of 50?  So humane and considerate of you...

Migration is not a solution. The solution is to build up something there, not to break down things here. 

You're a hypocrite because you're advocating a 1% migration as The solution... while the 99% keep languishing in the same state you pretend to deplore. Meanwhile, pressure on the labor market will erode worker's rights, making sure we lose the social progress we made during the last century. You are sacrificing real achievements to soothe your conscience.

&gt;No, worker's rights &amp; safety and migration restrictions are managed by entirely different laws in general.

You fail to see the consequences of your policy.

On the other hand, the Europeans need to figure out that what allows the US to cope with diversity is what is essentially endless land, endless water, etc. Plus, for immigrants and their descendants, every group that comes to America has to put their ethnic history into the past and keep it there. That means *everyone*. What we keep are the nice little things like culinary dishes, the occasional name, and not much else. It allows us to live in relative peace. Failure to do so causes tension; witness the challenge we have had with hispanics (currently), Irish, Poles, Germans, Japanese and others who have come in large numbers and have not assimilated quickly enough in the eyes of broader American society. There are even parallel societies within the US which have not faired well because they have not assimilated. Their challenges are numerous and heartbreaking. In other words, being different and in the minority on a societal level is often a recipe for prolonged hardship. Heck, the current handwringing over the impending demographic shift is a subconscious admission of this fact.

On top of all that, the constant social churn that comes hand in hand with immigrant and emigrant populations means an increased level of crime. Social institutions which are able to mitigate and resolve social tensions do not have the chance to form in our modern US society. Is Europe willing to accept this in their villages and cities?

Europe has incredible diversity as it is; and they have fought tooth and nail for centuries. Inviting the ""other"" into your home is a bad idea if there is no mechanism to put all history behind. On top of that, the sort of people coming in often hold values that are diametrically opposed to those espoused by modern European societies. This is a recipe for disaster.

Currently there are muslim college students who are successfully demanding that universities segregate classes. Is Europe, the birthplace of liberal thought, of liberty, equality and fraternity really willing to relegate women to a second class status in the universities (again)? There are roving muslim patrols in English towns assaulting citizens. Is Europe willing to accept the assault on the freedom to hold hands in public or to walk about with one's head uncovered? French citizens are being murdered in the streets and entire neighborhoods rise up in support of the killer. This does not bode well for the future.

&gt;Certain food colourings such as Brilliant Blue and Acid Yellow 23 are indeed not banned under EU regulations, but as far as I can see they are still banned in Sweden and other EU countries. So, no, you don't seem to be right there.



No, we have to sell it. We don't make food with that coloring, that is our choice, but *by law* which you seem to ignore, we can not ban something that is made in and sold in another EU country, apart from very, very rare exceptions, which do not apply to food. Belive us, we have tried. So, if Nestlé for example decides to make something in the UK which allows it and sell it in Sweden, we legally can not ban it. 

&gt;CAP headage payments were always at the same rate for everyone, and have been or are being phased out in favour of area based payments. I'm not sure what you're basing your claims on here - and going on your responses to date, you're not going to tell me, either. But again, you don't seem to be right on this one either.


No, the payment is not the same. I can tell you. First, they give more to things we can't even grow, like olives, sugar and wine. Second, they calculate thye prize of the cow on the number of trees (!!!!yes, odd, but that is how they do it) which we have more, so we get less. Nothing about how the cow is doing. In fact, from a veterinarian standpoint, our cows are better off since we have stricter animal laws. Not that the EU cares.Third - for example the EU has constantly voted down our attempts to minmize antibiotics, since they love antibiotics (or at least ignore todays science who speaks about restistance, how bad it is in food etc). Fourth, we have an *exception* in the regional funds, where you support rural areas, because so much of Sweden is rural, that otherwise we would have been a net recipient. 

Why is that fair?

&gt;As to why payments to Greece continue - because Greece continues to be poor, much as most of Africa does. Given that that means a lot of Greeks live below the poverty line, I can't see that they're doing it just to rob you. 


That does not in any way answer any question. Please answer. Why should I pay for them if they do not care to change? Why doesn't the EU care to change an obviously inefficient system?the structural funds are not working - why keep them?  Is there no limit for how long we should support them? If Estonia and Poland can grow, wtf is wrong with the south? 

Are you saying, with your comments about Africa, that you think that the citizens of the EU should pay for Greece for the foreseeable future? Is that your plan.


You are not answering my questions you know- Please start doing that. I think that part of the question is that you know Greece have fucked up massively, just like the EU and you don't want to admit that I am right, they are going to bleed those funds for the foreseeable future. Why can't we change that? You don't even seem to care, you seem to think that being part of the EU is endlessly paying for the south. Well, Ireland can do that, I see absolutely no compelling argument why we should do that. 

Please give me a compelling argument why we should endlessly pay for Greece and why you think transferring money for them for 50+ years i totally OK while other countries can get their act together. Why not Greece?  (lets face it, they are getting funds top 2020, and it is hardly likee they are going to be donors by 2020, their debt is 170%!!!!). 

And, with regards to Africa - are you aware that several African economists are asking no more aid. In fact, there are good theories as to why one shouldn't aid a country to long, because it becomes dependent on that help. But- you think it is a good strategy for Greece ?

Relevant bit

&gt;*While there is a large body of research examining crime in urban areas, far less attention has been given to rural crime. There is reason to expect rural crime to be different from that in urban areas; rural and urban places differ on a variety of characteristics – demographic, economic, structural, and social – that are known to be correlated with crime. Unfortunately, there have been relatively few systematic examinations of rural-urban differences in crime rates. Although they are few, existing studies show a fairly consistent pattern; urban areas generally have higher crime rates than do rural areas, supporting the assertion that there are important differences between rural and urban places. Findings of lower rural crime rates date back to the beginning of the 20^th century* [sic!] *(see Krohn, Lanza-Kaduce, and Akers 1984), when researchers were concerned with the effects of urbanization and suggested that urban areas fostered crime. Research consistently found that urban places have higher crime rates than rural places, as shown in Quinney‘s (1966) study using national data from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) on offenses known to police (from 1960- 1961).*",0,1386755295,null,0,false,0,cdz1dq4,t3_1sl28r,t1_cdz1dq4,t1_cdz186r,null,1428273067,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

""You can remove the negro from the jungle, but you can't remove the jungle from the negro""


All of these statements are from elected politicians. Personally, I think its OK to publish this (altough the pictures could have stayed hidden), as public persons should expect to be reviewed. What they said awful, and not the same as a critique of immigration. The people voting should know what their representatives stand for.

It is, however, when they start publishing the info of non-offical persons, or civilians, that things get problematic. Here's some statements from the second reveal, this time from civilians:

""He uses word such as Blatte (derogative term for black person), zigenare (semi-derogative term for Gypsies) and Niggerboll (another name for the swedish pastry more often called Chocolate-ball). He also claimed that the gypsies ""Steal like crows""

This is much les controversial, and there is no way statements like these should warrant public shaming of this kind.

true,G_Morgan,WALE,Wales,"&gt; Steyn argues that these programs erode humanity's basic sense of self-reliance to a point at which a more resilient group of people—Muslims in this case—will take control

That concept is counter historical. Nations have historically persisted as much through bureaucratic inertia as anything else. It is self reliance that causes the collapse of states. When the state folds in on itself and people are left to defend for themselves their identities start to diverge. It happened to the WRE as Gallic and Iberian Romans found themselves questioning what the dude in ""Rome"" (for definitions of Rome that mean Milan or Ravenna) actually does. Britain rebelled from Rome originally mainly because well what was it actually doing for Britain?

Nothing binds the UK more than institutions like the NHS and BBC. If they were to disappear you'd start to question what relationship Wales and England really have.

&gt; Beyond a demographic problem, Europe lacks the will to defend itself, leading to the third factor: civilizational exhaustion.

Turkey aside, the UK and France could trounce the entire middle east tomorrow. Occupation isn't possible but they could certainly smash any real threat.

I mean have all European countries been pacifist for the past 40 years?

Danish exports are now back bigger than before the crisis hit , and passes this year
violent 1.000 billion. Thus, exports are now significantly larger than private consumption , which is something relatively new in this country.


For the first time ever, Danish exports of both goods and services year round magic 1,000 billion
crowns. It will be the highest ever level and mark a milestone for the Danish economy with exports
again greater than before the crisis hit , whether it be measured in real or nominal . But also a record ,
where export tradition of Danish economy is greater than at any other time in the history of Denmark .


The large and increasing exports are helping to give Denmark some rather extreme surplus of
balance of payments abroad , which currently puts one record after another.
Nothing less than the 127.6 billion kroner is the plus stands at over the last 12 months . It is more than a
tripled since 2008 and represent about seven percent of the Danish gross domestic product ( GDP).
It is also so much that it now exceeds those limits, the EU has set up in this area. running a
country thus huge profits of more than six percent of GDP for three consecutive years , it triggers a warning and a
special procedure in which Danish economy taking a closer look at the seams.


""The huge surplus of the current account because the Danish competitiveness is far better
than its reputation . But that imports in the doldrums because of the weak growth in the Danish economy and
our property incomes from abroad shoots rapidly increased, ""says Frederik I. Pedersen, Senior Consultant at
AE area. He expects overall Danish exports this year to reach to nearly 1,010 billion , which is a historical
numbers that have never been seen before .


Thus , exports 55 per cent of our gross domestic product and run increasingly from the
Another big trolling motor in the Danish economy , namely private consumption, which is down to more modest 915
billion, or 49 percent of GDP.


**Globalisation changes the structure**

Also chief economist Helge J. Pedersen of Nordea expect exports this year exceeds 1,000 billion,
Also he describes as ' sensational '.
""For export share of Danish GDP having risen from about a third of just 15 years ago to now more
than 50 percent. It is globalization, which in this way to significantly alters the structure of Danish
economy , and that makes us increasingly dependent on both the international economy , but also of having
good competitiveness , ""says Helge J. Pedersen.


Overall , there are 750,000 people in Denmark , representing close to a quarter of the workforce who have a job that
directly or indirectly, kept alive by Danish exports.
""But the figure was as high as 850,000 before the crisis started . So exports are greater than ever , but it is
employment, certainly not , ""said Allan Sorensen, a senior consultant at DI .
He adds that productivity has increased significantly in the Danish export companies since the crisis started ,
since employment has fallen by 100,000 , while sales are up . This is because companies
has placed great emphasis on saving and reducing costs


For many years, through both the 1970s , 1980s , 1990s and part of the noughties , private consumption increased
than exports of goods and services. But this is no more , thus also marks a new
tendency for the Danish economy .
At current prices , Danish exports are already more than 50 billion larger than the nearly 950 billion
crowns, which exports recorded in 2008 , just before the crisis really started . In real terms , exports are slightly higher ,
before the crisis began.
It is especially large wage and property income, which increases the Danish surplus on the current
records of payments . The profits of this post is about the past year at 62 billion dollars , or
almost half of the total profits . It is therefore increasingly Denmark fortune abroad, and the
Danish companies' investments abroad , ensuring the huge current account surplus . Also
trade in services has in recent years shown an increasing surplus",0,1386758100,null,0,false,0,cdz1ssi,t3_1slne8,t1_cdz1ssi,t3_1slne8,null,1428272872,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Mayence Hauptbahnhof is a major knot in the area, many commuting from and to Frankfurt and to the rest of the greater Rhein-Main Gebiet. 
I was just lucky that had time and could schedule time travels and had no important appointments. 
I almost forget: They announced this about one! week earlier after many commuters already stranded in Mayence Hauptbahnhof in the evening hours. That is a classic Deutsche Bahn - move, always late on information/announcement, sometimes a total lack of, and never clear information given. Plus, earlier there was an incident were two S-Bahn(nen/s) almost collided, as they were an the same track! That caused an delay for about 2 hours for me, stuck in train on the right side of the Rhine (versus left, being Rheinland-Pfalz). Lucky me, I chose only trains with AC during this trip and had plenty of water with me so while it was annoying I didn't get cooked on that hot July day. And on top of that I almost chose one of those S-Bahn that almost collided... but I chose comfort (AC) over early arrival.

I've always voted for the greens so far and I still really believe that climate change and energy independence is the most important political issue. Especially on the European level, where green policy can have a much bigger and effective impact.

But on the other hand I have a lot of sympathy for the socialdemocrats. I'd like to see the European Union take a turn to the left in their economic policy and I do think that this election could change that. If the socialdemocrats win these elections and become the biggest fraction again, it's probable that the EU will rethink some policies. Especially now that the fractions each will propose their own President of the European Commission. If the socialdemocrats decisively win these election, it's highly probable the European Council win install the socialdemocrat candidate (Martin Shultz) as the new president of the commission. I know that Barosso also comes from the left side of the political spectrum, but he was never chosen by the masses. Martin Shultz would have a mandate and a role as representative of his voters.

So I'm a doubting. On the one hand a more leftist approach is something I think will only happen with the socialdemocrats, because they'll be big enough to change the course. On the other hand in some way this whole economic side of the story doesn't matter anyway with the threath of climate change hanging above our heads.

Remember the referendums, the Constitution, that they banned an annotated Lisbon treaty from being printed that was readable as a single document instead of listing annotations to existing treaties until after the vote.  Remember the budget talks where an extension was blocked and so they just increased the last budget retroactively when that would be the default and threatened closed door balloting.

The EP is there to make things look presentable.  The moment it becomes inconvenient they work out a bypass and we're left needing whistleblowers to find out things like this:

I'm telling you that this city and this region are years behind my home city. Are you just mad because I'm telling the truth?

I think that the fact that France begrudgingly copies us is the cultural proof that we are ahead. Walk around your city in France and take note of how many american flags you see on scarves, handbags, t-shirts, and other accessories. Take a look at the youth and notice their baseball hats with the names of our cities, NY, LA, Atlanta, Chicago. What language do french artists sing in to get popular? That's right, american english. Notice how on French TV you can get an easy laugh from the audience by making fun of american cuisine, while every time I go to Mcdonalds at 20H, it's packed!

How long have you lived in the US? If you don't think France is behind even a little bit based on what you've seen, then you yourself may have not lived in the US long enough. We don't steal like you do, and we don't throw our cigarettes on the ground. 

Sure there are big cities in France now, great, but how long did that take after the industrial revolution? I don't think there are hoards of americans tourists in Strasbourg in the summer time. It's not because you have internet and iphones that you have caught up to us. Where's your IT industry?

This country is so old that you can find a regional accent change by traveling 30 minutes in any direction. The capital is 3 hours away but it feels like a continent away for most people. For a small country that has a TGV, people are still very isolated.

“I have also invited Brother Leader Gaddafi to this country [South Africa]. And I do that because our moral authority dictates that we should not abandon
those who helped us in the darkest hour in the history of this country. Not only did they [Libya] support us in return, they gave us the resources for us to conduct our struggle, and to win. And those South Africans who have berated me, for being loyal to our friends, literally they can go and throw themselves into a pool.”

“My delegation and I are overjoyed with the invitation from the Brother Guide to visit the Great Popular and Socialist Arab Libyan Jamahiriya. I have been waiting impatiently ever since we received the invitation…. I would like to remind you that the first time I came here, in 1962, the country was in a very different state of affairs. One could not but be struck by the sights of poverty from the moment of arrival….with all of its usual corollaries: hunger, illness, lack of housing and of health-care facilities, etc. Anger and revolt could be read in those days on the faces of everyone….

“Since then, things have changed considerably. During our stay in prison, we read and heard a great deal about the changes which have come about in this country and about the blossoming of the economy which has been experienced here. There is prosperity and progress everywhere here today which we were able to see even before the airplane touched ground. It is thus with great pleasure that we have come on a visit in the Jamahiriya, impatient to meet our brother, the Guide Qadhafi.”

Your first link shows olive oil producers want to keep their subsidies. Doesn't suprise me. 

But the second link states that CAP payments primarily go to northern countries (86% of total payment, page 18). Not sure what you want to show me with that with regards to southern subsidies. Even if you deviate from the papers definition and count Ireland to the north and all of France and Italy to the south, the ratio becomes about 50:50, it certainly doesn't reverse.

Your third link shows a wide coalition of opponents against sugar quotas. (I'm one of them :)). So I don't know why this is a Sweden vs. rest issue? The industries in question might be in other countries, but they oppose liberalisation because they are these industries, not because they are in these countries. But, opposition mounts, it won't be for long.

The fourth link sounds good. [Apparently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy#The_CAP_today) quite a few of his suggestions were implemented. Altogether the relative size of the CAP budget has shrunk to almost a half of what it was 30 years ago. I think it's on the right track.

As for the rest of your post, as you can see in your second link, originally subsidies certainly **didn't** go to the south. They also don't refuse to reform, seeing as quite a bit has changed over the years. You have to understand, though, that other countries' economies are more dependent on agriculture and will thus be more conservative when it comes to making big changes to that sector.

As for your taxes: yes, you do pay more. But you also get back much more. You should move to the south for a while to experience the lower living standard/level of social services if you think they are resting on your tax kronor.

If you have the technology to build a self-sustaining giant dome, you can just put it into space where there's no gravity well, with centrifugal force for artificial gravity.

Wow. First off: Space stations with centrifugal forces as artificial gravity are much more complex and difficult to engineer than colonies on other planets. I have no doubt that space stations like this will be build, but it isn't a reason not to build planet colonies because they have one giant advantage.

Secondly: I already gave you a point, yet you simply ignore it. Colonies get us resources. Space stations can't, atleast not on the scale colonies can.

&gt; Domes would make sense on a planet with life, but atmosphere toxic to humans or something like that.

I don't understand, you kind of messed up your English there.

&gt; Because it does nothing. You spend billions to put a few humans in space, they perhaps wave some flag, then they get back. Nothing actually gets achieved.

Who did you again accuse of having no basic knowledge? There's literally hundreds of gigantic lists filled with the inventions we use everyday that were created in the space industry, including human spaceflight.

&gt; Spending these billions on researching technology actually moves us closer to controlling outer space. So sending humans into space harms these efforts by hampering the actually productive alternative.

No one wants to invest in technology if it doesn't do shit. People and companies will not develop new technology if it doesn't do anything. Human spaceflight gives research a legitimate goal and reason and thus will greatly encourage it.

&gt; There's a reason why Americans stopped their Moon missions. It was completely pointless once propaganda purposes were achieved.

No the reason was: The technology wasn't advanced enough to make the moon useful. We are now working on technologies that make the moon useful again, that's why so many companies and countries are already planning human missions to the moon. For the first time the moon can become useful: See the Japanese idea of building a solar farm, the large quantities of Titanium on the moon, the idea to make it an outpost for further space missions, using the moon as a defence mechanism against meteorites and comets.",0,1386766116,null,0,false,0,cdz33ay,t3_1sjvqw,t1_cdz33ay,t1_cdyopqi,null,1428272270,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If you'd have said we need to vote to reform before or around 2004 I would have empathised, even agreed with you. 

Then I just thought it was inept, excessively bureaucratic and wasteful.    After the contempt they showed around the referendums I realised it went deeper than that.    The reemergence of ACTA or President Schulz [championing Hobsbawm](http://www.ukipmeps.org/news_761_Farage-Who-is-an-extremist-Mr-Schulz.html), those are just confirmation indicators.  Since 2009 we've seen countries told to put off elections, made to give free tv channel rights to Euronews stations as a condition for bailouts, to lend at a rate greater they can borrow, and even the current accounts of citizens of a common currency frozen.  There are times you pump the brakes of the bus or pull on the wheel; there are other times when you need to open the doors and tuck &amp; roll.  How much is too much, because all these things have already come to pass?

Back then when everything was 'going great' the warning was that the Euro was set up wrong and that sooner or later there'd be a crisis.  It was poo-poo'd at the time because things were going great and there was a lot of cheap credit to be had.  

This time it's the European Stability Mechanism brought about because of the crisis.  They're not fixing mistakes in a reform sense, but doubling down over bad foundations.

You could negotiate with your landlord, but the standard contract used to specify payments in case of leaving early. The new law is supposedly different, you also sign for an extended period, but you can leave early if you announce it with a couple months. I'm not well versed in the new situation, since I've been renting the same flat for some time. 

*  Short-term renting is usually negotiated on a month-by-month (or even weekly) basis, but you are not supposed to be living there, just vacationing, and there are restrictions to stay length. 

All of this is theory, as I'm sure lots of people are in greyish areas between these two, and there are lots of long-term rentals camouflaged as vacational homes (look out for ""no se puede empadronar"" or ""contrato de nueve meses máximo"" and the kind). 

As other people have already pointed out, ""Spanish coast"" is very vague. From the beaches of Cadiz to Finisterre, you will find very different climate and lifestyles. 

Anyway, 1.5k euros is more than enough for  some quite nice places in most of Spain right now, but it depends a lot on the area. ",0,1386766675,null,0,false,0,cdz37az,t3_1slu4z,t1_cdz37az,t3_1slu4z,null,1428272217,5,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,5

For clarity the threat of UKIP in the EP has allowed the three key demands to be laid at David Cameron's feet, who has already passed the responsibility of negotiating down to the Foreign Office:

• British firms should only have to conform with single market rules when they are selling to the single market.

• Britain should have complete freedom to negotiate free trade agreements with other countries.

• European courts should not have jurisdiction over the UK.

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/10/eurosceptic-britain-membership-change-or-exit

A dominant UKIP in the EP is engineering impossible minimum demands of the European Project in domestic politics.   When they can't be met there'll be a pro-exit surge in the polls where they already have a lead, because on the face of it these might be inconsistent for the Europe-project but otherwise they don't appear unreasonable.

That, and whilst they are there in the EP they can sit at the front as they do now and point out the problems of the EU which is now starting to filter back across the channel and into the news.",0,1386768141,null,0,false,0,cdz3ikc,t3_1smhrd,t1_cdz3ikc,t1_cdz2wng,null,1428272071,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,project_apex,NETH,Not Deutsch,"&gt; If you see human dignity as a fundamental right, then you wouldn't leave it up to national governments to uphold. One of the reasons I'm pro-EU is because it puts more pressure on national governments to uphold human rights treaties and the ECHR. 

That doesn't work. People won't accept a foreign institution or country to pressure them into changing their culture. I understand that you feel like it's needed, and tackling homophobia NEEDS to happen. 

But you have to realise that a cultural change, wich is what we are after, can ONLY come from within and from the ground up. It can never go the other way around. You can try and force it on a country or population but all that you will do is give them the feeling they are pushed into a corner. 

Lets look at two countries: Poland and Russia. 

When Poland joined the EU it was more homophobic than it is now. The catholic churche has a significant influence there and 20 years ago, you really didn't want to live in Poland as a gay person. BUT! That is changing, people are more open to the idea of gay people and a political party even made it one of their slogans! 

The EU didn't do much for it. There were no officials boycotting poland, no extreme media coverage, no protests. Europe didn't force Poland to change its laws or culture. It merely showed them that accepting gay people *doesn't* ruin your society. **Europe led by example!**. And now Poland is slowly moving towards the west regarding the acceptance of gay people. The road is long, but they are taking the steps.

Now take Russia: the entire Western society, media, officials and NGO's are constantly bashing Russia and Putin for its homophobic laws. People are even boycotting the Olympics, wich should be a very proud moment for a country and its people to host. As a result Putin can show himself as 'the defender of Russian culture'. I mean, you have to understand that, similar to Poland some decades ago, 80% of the Russian people are anti-gay. And when you constantly bash Russia for it in the media you push the Russian people in a corner. 

The boycotting, media attention, bashing, **it is a constant stream of propaganda opportunities for Putin.** And with every news item you push Russia and, more important, the Russian people away from the west and away from liberal views towards gay people and gay marriage.**

Constantly pointed out that a country is 'wrong' in your eyes *sounds* like a good idea, but it is the most counterproductive thing you can do if you really want gay people to have it better in Russia.

That said: **No. It is never a good idea to try and have some 'supranational'(the EU is even seen as something foreign to most of its inhabitants) try and force human rights on others.**

Basically, you can't. You live in a German speaking environment now. Your English will be influenced by the Germans who speak English around you and your mind being in ""German mode"" simply because that's what you hear most of the day. You literally can't stop it except getting more English in your head. Do stuff like reading books alternating in English and German. Get some English podcasts going. Watch English YouTube videos. It won't make it perfect but less obvious. 

About your American *accent* (not dialect. An accent is a part of a dialect. Armish is an American German dialect. You've just got an accent), that should change over time.

But you live in Swabia so good bloody luck with getting rid of a strong accent because you either sound like an American or Swabian :D

Aucun rapport avec la valeur réelle, actuelle, certes. Mais une bulle se crée lorsque l'on attend de l'entreprise qu'elle va vendre plus de produits dans le futur. Mais alors c'est pas vraiment une bulle ça. Une bulle, c'est quelque chose qui peut éclater. Dans quel cas est-ce que ça éclate? Bah si l'entreprise ne gagne toujours pas ce qu'on attendait d'elle parce qu'on a trop esperer sur elle. En clair c'était un mauvais investissement. Non pas parce que l'entreprise a coulé ou quoi, mais parce que les investisseurs, actionnaires, on mal jugé.

Ainsi la bulle des trains ou la bulle d'internet, se sont révélé être des bulles car il y a vait trop d'investissement et pas assez de retour à court terme.

Mais je vois pas le problème dans tout ça, c'est juste des gens qui prennent des risque et qui se font mordre en retour quand ça marche pas... Parce que si ça marche ils ont créé de la valeur, en participant à l'élboration de l'internet. Et ils auront créé des jobs par la même ocasion.

Le reste de la bulle c'est la spéculation. Je vois pas le problème à ce que les spéculateurs perdent du frics si ils font des conneries.

&gt; Tu es dans l'idéologie, mais tu n'avances aucun raisonnement. Tu pars de la conclusion pour justifier les prémisses.

Oui je suis dans l'idéologie, mais je vois pas où mon raisonnement diverge (et je vois encore moins pourquoi j'aurais besoin de source pour le coup, je donne pas de chiffre...). 

Si tu crées un produit que les gens veulent. Tu peux gagner du frics grâce à ce produit. Une fois que ça marche bien, tu te fais coté. Tu vend ainsi tes actions ou tu fais des investissements dans la boîte, et tu deviens plus riches. C'est la où je me mêle les pinceaux? 

&gt; Il y a également d'autres raisons. Facebook par exemple a été créé pour draguer des meufs, et sans aucun modèle économique. L'orgueil, l'altruisme, la volonté de domination, la peur, le patriotisme sont autant de raisons qui n'ont aucun rapport avec la création de richesse.

Ca c'est une question philosophique. L'important c'est le résultat ou la motivation? Moi je penche sur le résultat.

&gt; Et surtout, dans tous ton commentaire, tu ignores soigneusement le problème : des exclus dorment dans les parcs, des exclus pour qui il est devenu très difficile de se loger, de se nourrir, de vivre dignement tout simplement, et pourtant des exclus indispensables au bon fonctionnement de la silicon valley.

Tu ne peux pas être exclus si tu est absolument indispensable (sauf peut-être quand l'état s'en mêle). La question est de savoir à cause de quoi ces personne sont dans cet état? Est-ce que c'est à cause des millionaire de la sillicon valley, ou est-ce autre chose?

&gt; Une forte proportion de migrants, légaux et illégaux.

Illégaux grâce à l'Etat.

&gt; une classe de travailleurs mal payés pour les servir

Pourquoi sont-ils aussi nombreux dans ce coin alors? C'est que y a pas assez de boulots et trop de demandeurs, c'est pour ça qu'ils sont mal payés. Mais encore une fois c'est pas les milliardaires qu'on décidé d'appeler à venir dans le coin autant de personnes.

Autre question alors: si ils sont aussi nombreux, il doit bien en avoir qui sortent du lot et qui gagne plus grâce à un meilleur travail, qu'est ce qui fait qu'ils sont incapable de monter l'échelle social? C'est la question principal, mais l'article ne l'aborde pas vraiment. Y a plus de boulot pour les classe moyenne? Depuis quand? Y a toujours du boulot pour les classes moyennes ne serait que grâce à la clientèle des classes les plus pauvres? Faudrais aussi définir quelles sont les boulots de classes moyennes et de classes pauvre, c'est loin d'être mon expertise...

&gt; Mais tu préfère l'égalité? Tout le monde également dans la misère?
C'est un faux dilemme.

Nen nen, je pense pas que ce soit un faux dilemme, c'est une question idéologique essentielle! Je pense que les programmes sociaux sont inéfficient et par la même détruise de la valeur. Le marché de l'autre côté est plus efficient et ne détruit pas de valeur. Cependant le marché est, à condition que les politiques ne soit pas attardés (bien que c'est souvent le cas), moins égalitaire. Mais tant qu'on est efficient, on va faire en sorte de diminuer les coûts de très nombreux biens et services, et finalment, même les plus pauvres auront des conditions de vie absolument incomparable par rapport à ce qu'ils pourraient obtenir des services sociaux. (Sauf dans le cas par exemple des handicaps, mais les services sociaux ne s'occupent pas que des handicaps que je sache)

&gt;You're telling me that the paramilitary training in the our russia youth camps is just for what exactly

There is no 'paramilitary training' in Russian youth camps of pro-Putin organisations. It's widely known that activities in their youth camp you seem to be talking about (Seliger) are mostly confined to all sorts of brainwashing. I knew a guy who attended it, he and his friends are mostly peaceful 'normal' young go-getters, nothing like SA types you make them look.


It's not nashi that rigged the elections, nashi are unimportant. Elections were rigged by adding votes to Putin and United Russia in the process of counting votes. In some areas of the country final vote tables were just 'drawn' outright by officials (you may find some results for subdivisions of Chechnya that look like rows of 81.12, 81.56, 81.99… all the way down the list). People in the army, in prisons and mental institutions were made to vote for Putin or their votes were 'drawn' like votes in Chechnya. People in low-tier state jobs (think of nurses or teachers) were strongly encouraged to vote for Putin, subsequently they were made to attend pro-Putin rallies to make it look like there is so-so much support for Putin. In fact, Putin and United Russia would still win the elections, but with much more modest results. Opinion polls show that Putin's rating was about 50% before the last elections (he got 63% of votes in the end). It's not even known for sure if multiple violations is product of Putin's decision or they were carried out 'spontaneously' at the discretion of local authorities who were eager to serve well.

true,Err_Eek,TRAN,Romanian living in Ireland,"&gt; Obviously ""the market"" (read: big corp) asks for a policy that would decrease wages.

It's also some of those big corporations that made food and goods are available as they are today. Back when countries where more isolated and mom and pop stores where the norm, you also had more people living shitty lives. I'm not saying that corporations can't be downright abusive, I'm just saying it's childish to use them as universal bogeymen.

&gt; You were talking about lifting all restrictions. Give examples.

There is no country with 0 restrictions on immigration. But one can see that less restrictive ones (like Canada, Sweden) don't fare worse than more restrictive ones (Japan, Denmark). And by that I was pointing out to the fact that it's better to be significantly less restrictive, since by restrictions you're just hurting the immigrants.

&gt; The poorest of the world aren't able to afford the trip.

And by this you're telling me that it's alright to send back the still-quite-poor-but-not-yet-beggars (i.e. the ones that managed to get to your country by selling their life's savings on the hope of a better life) back?

&gt; There is no labor shortage, no matter what big corp tells you.

Except it's not labor pretty college educated white people (yes still unemployable) like doing. Tough to convince a lit major to start cleaning toilets. Closing the borders never fixed the economy of a country. But close your borders -- and you'll see that it will be the pretty white people that will much rather emigrate to be accountants in New Zealand rather than be dishwashers in Zeeland.

&gt; You're the one who is advocating to give them less rights than the citizens. 

I'm the one who wants to make them citizens (just in case I wasn't direct enough). And I'm the one who wants to give them the better life they want as well, the life they want. Sorry, spin it as much as possible, but there's no way you can take the moral upper hand here.

&gt; Importing a class of maids and servants for the Herrenvolk is unacceptable for me.

[2nd time you lose the argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law). As for class of maids and servants, look at how maidey and servanty asians living in Vancouver are nowdays. Or Italians living in New York. Or all those bajillion people of Irish descent all over the US. Fuck, I just supervised a college exam for people that will probably end up being medics, and nearly half of them were such immigrants whom apparently aren't destined to be maids for the Herrenvolk. Remember, the Nazi's themselves where rather big on isolationism and prioritizing their own. At least read the Cliffnotes version of National Socialism before you start calling people literally Hitler.

&gt; The solution is to build up something there, not to break down things here.

Break what things? The soothing background noise of people not speaking foreign languages?

&gt; You're a hypocrite because you're advocating a 1% migration as The solution... while the 99% keep languishing in the same state you pretend to deplore.

It's simply not true that you can change everything by example. Some parts of the country do, like Western Europe, and some don't, like Southern Europe. And in fact, the only civil rights changes in southern Europe come from ECHR sanctions and fines, and EU-admission prerequisites. 

Historically, even countries like Switzerland and the US, with strong ""state/canton rights"" traditions had stepped in to give vote to women or black people in parts of the country where the minority of the population constituted the majority of the population able to vote. 

And in the end, we know that EU is not going to mandate same-sex marriage (as if this is the most important topic in Southern Europe). The actions would be way more fundamental, like making discrimination illegal, even if the majority of the country wants to keep discriminating (eg, Greece's highest court upholded an employees HIV status as a fair ground for dismissal. ECHR struck that down), and by encouraging people to seek change (pretty much every civil rights movement in Cyprus depends on EU funds).

So: no. The dignity of all marginalised people should not be depended on the ruling elite's political games to satisfy some influential minority, or a racist majority whatever is the case. Human rights are not up for majority-rule voting in a liberal democracy, nor ""they can way 30 years more, it will get better because EU will lead by example"".

I agree that transparency is a good thing. My point is not really about democratic legitimacy (though I agree with you that it would make sense to move powers from unelected people to elected people in the EU), but a constitutional question. You'll see that I did not mention democracy in my earlier post. I would like EU law not to have primacy over UK law and this does not really relate directly to democracy. I also wonder how possible it really is for there to be democracy in Europe, given that arguably there is no demos.

I don't think your points about the Queen, the British PM and the House of Lords have much relevance in this respect. The Queen is hugely popular and has almost no political power. The PM is less popular, but we can get rid of him rather easily in an election. There isn't an appetite in the UK for a directly elected PM. The House of Lords is a whole other discussion. Anyway, the British constitution, not being written down, is able to evolve slowly and reflect the times and the climes. For example, constitutional theorists argued that the ability for the UK to declare war has moved in the last year or so from the executive to the legislature, after the ""no"" vote on a war with Syria.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;No, we have to sell it. We don't make food with that coloring, that is our choice, but by law which you seem to ignore, we can not ban something that is made in and sold in another EU country, apart from very, very rare exceptions, which do not apply to food. Belive us, we have tried. So, if Nestlé for example decides to make something in the UK which allows it and sell it in Sweden, we legally can not ban it. 

OK, that makes more sense! Well, sense in the legal sense.

&gt;No, the payment is not the same. I can tell you. First, they give more to things we can't even grow, like olives, sugar and wine.

Which has nothing to do with cows, and which is matched by their difficulties in growing other subsidised produce.

&gt; Second, they calculate thye prize of the cow on the number of trees (!!!!yes, odd, but that is how they do it) which we have more, so we get less. Nothing about how the cow is doing. In fact, from a veterinarian standpoint, our cows are better off since we have stricter animal laws. Not that the EU cares.

...I just find this one weird. Can you point to relevant legislation or official FAQs of some kind?

&gt;Third - for example the EU has constantly voted down our attempts to minmize antibiotics, since they love antibiotics (or at least ignore todays science who speaks about restistance, how bad it is in food etc). 

I'd also need references for this one, given that Denmark and Holland seem to have antibiotic reduction programmes.

&gt;Fourth, we have an exception in the regional funds, where you support rural areas, because so much of Sweden is rural, that otherwise we would have been a net recipient. 

The regional funds aren't simply for rural areas, though, but for poor areas.

&gt;That does not in any way answer any question. Please answer. Why should I pay for them if they do not care to change? Why doesn't the EU care to change an obviously inefficient system?the structural funds are not working - why keep them? Is there no limit for how long we should support them? If Estonia and Poland can grow, wtf is wrong with the south?

&gt;Are you saying, with your comments about Africa, that you think that the citizens of the EU should pay for Greece for the foreseeable future? Is that your plan.

&gt;You are not answering my questions you know- Please start doing that. I think that part of the question is that you know Greece have fucked up massively, just like the EU and you don't want to admit that I am right, they are going to bleed those funds for the foreseeable future. Why can't we change that? You don't even seem to care, you seem to think that being part of the EU is endlessly paying for the south. Well, Ireland can do that, I see absolutely no compelling argument why we should do that.

I don't think it's necessarily endless. And I can't necessarily answer your questions, because some of them only you can answer. I don't have any problem at all in agreeing that Greece has fucked up awesomely, and that letting Greece into both the EU and the eurozone were poor decisions in purely financial terms.

&gt;Please give me a compelling argument why we should endlessly pay for Greece and why you think transferring money for them for 50+ years i totally OK while other countries can get their act together. Why not Greece? (lets face it, they are getting funds top 2020, and it is hardly likee they are going to be donors by 2020, their debt is 170%!!!!).

&gt;And, with regards to Africa - are you aware that several African economists are asking no more aid. In fact, there are good theories as to why one shouldn't aid a country to long, because it becomes dependent on that help. But- you think it is a good strategy for Greece ? Please explain in detail why, and what would change? 

I don't have a compelling argument with respect to Greece, and I'd agree your points with respect to aid and aid dependency. However, aid dependency isn't a guaranteed outcome, since, as I said, Ireland went from net recipient to net payer. Greece's sovereign debt, as I've already pointed out, is unrelated to ongoing EU funding. Countries can become net payers with high debt/GDP ratios, as Italy is, for example. Also as I said, Sweden is *not* involved in Greek debt aid through the EFSF or ESM, because those are eurozone initiatives. 

Is continued EU payment to Greece through subsidies a good strategy? Overall, the answer is probably yes. It's not the same as aid to most countries - EU subsidies are much more targeted and much more overseen. If they're being targeted at things that will make a positive difference to Greece (and they were in Ireland), then they're worth continuing, because Greece would be worse off without them. And the world's environment would be that much worse off in turn.

It comes down to whether you feel sufficient sympathy with the Greek people to think that they deserve your assistance or not, which is something you should probably consider in the light of exactly how much assistance you actually give them, which averages about €20.21/year per adult Swede from 2000-2011 (I should probably thank you at this point for the €4.77 per year each adult Swede has contributed to Ireland over the same period). 

Would I contribute the same amount as an adult Swede to Greece? Sure, I have no problem with that. You perhaps do, but all that would tell is the relative value of €20 and Greece to each of us.",0,1386774611,null,0,1386774931,0,cdz5erm,t3_1sgdtv,t1_cdz5erm,t1_cdz1ct3,null,1428271187,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
true,project_apex,NETH,Not Deutsch,"&gt; It is obvious that you cant push something from the top and then it just works. But I think human rights is exactly the kind of thing that should be pushed from the top and there have been many improvements in this in the last fifty years because of the EU and the UN.

All the countries that joined the EU and UN did so voluntarely. And the UN doesn't force anything on its members (Saudi Arabia is a member of the [women rights council](http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/11/10/iran_blocked_but_saudi_arabia_accepted_for_un_women_board#sthash.uJg98FJF.dpbs), LOL).

I hope you do get that I'm not agianst speaking out for human rights. But if you *really* want to change the way certain societies look at these subjects,  in stead of wanting to 'send a signal' or get on Tv as politician, then you should know that your only being counterproductive when you bash or boycot them.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"The real question is can Russia afford *not* to do this.

You're looking at a country which would be utterly crippled without a strong oil and gas industry. They've got about 20 years of proven oil left, and while they have about 70 years of proven gas reserves at current rates, a desire to have circa 5% economic growth per year (dependent on increased gas exports, realistically), plus poor investment in technology and infrastructure means that Russia's best bet for staying at its current level of power for the 21st century is to be *the* country with access to all of the Arctic oil and gas reserves.

By the mid-point of the century, if their bet pays off, the world will still be heavily dependent on O&amp;G, America and the Middle east will have exhausted or be near exhaustion of much of their oil and gas reserves, the north sea will be drained, and their arctic oil and gas will power not just Europe, but much of the world, making them incredibly wealthy, and of course as we see since the Russians aren't above basic bully boy tactics, also bringing them great power.

If you look now at the way the Russians are going, the entire direction of the country would support the idea that they're going to push for the Arctic in the next few decades. The Russians are tooling up their military, attempting to weaken the EU at every opportunity (the one foe they really have to   take care of all on their own, one way or another), they're building links with the Chinese and quite happily setting up a symbiotic relationship, as well as arming anyone who wants it with advanced military tech. The US is doing its pivot and I suspect the Russians are hoping that by the time they push into the Arctic and claim it the US will be too distracted with China to be able to mount serious opposition, although I suspect that if it comes to it they'd be prepared for a mid-level conflict just to gain control of the arctic. Norway and Canada don't stand a chance against the Russians, economically, militarily, or politically.

And that &lt;10% of UK GDP isn't going anywhere.

I am an atheist and very intolerant of religion, but i separate my vegetables from my protein.
People are not defined by their environment, and their beliefs do not guarantee their actions.

Muslim culture has been increasinly anti-american in the last 40 years, and for good reason, because of circumstances we treated African, indian and even russian people with more respect and tolerrance than we gave musliims, and by that i mean actual respect not political correctness(we have that in gallons but its not a substitute for the real thing.) This combined with a cultural gap between old and new muslims gives rise to militants, but the most important thing the Arab revolutions and the protest in Turkey say about muslims is that they want secularism, they are willing to bleed and die for freedom.

Also, ""established""; check your history, islam is more established than protestant Christinaity and even the gap between mainstreem Christianity and Islam is very small.

Ultimately, we all have preferences about where we think power should lie and how close to us that power should be and the extent of our nation. This really comes down to personal preference more than anything else and is based on emotional reasons rather than rational ones.  

For a lot of EUphiles, they prefer power to be at a European level and the EU to extend across Europe. They want to be in a union of Europeans rather than non-Europeans and they would not want to federalise with, for example, USA, China, India, N. Korea, India to join their union. This preference has a lot to do with recent European history and memory of the world wars, a lot of Europeans trust a European superstate more than they trust their own state or more than they trust other nations in Europe.

For me the preference is that power over me lies at the level of the UK government rather than at the European level or at some world level. A lot of British people share this view and again this comes down to history. Because of our history, we trust the British nation state more than we trust what comes from the continent.

Archiviazione o assoluzione per insussistenza del fatto, semprechè il procuratore riceva il fascicolo della denuncia, considerando il malessere delle FdO e il loro ""potere"" di decidere il momento in cui inoltrare le denunce in Procura per il prosieguo dell'azione penale. ;-)  

Tralasciando ogni considerazione relativa all'art. 21 Cost. (il nostro 5th Amendment), è sufficiente leggere bene l'art. 266 cp indicato nel link dell'OP.

Si notano subito due espressioni dal sapore aulico et vagamente desueto, che i procuratori più ~~pigri~~ sgamati utilizzeranno per chiudere alla svelta la questione e tornare a fare cose più importanti: **""istigare""** e  **apologia di fatti contrari alle leggi**.

""Istigare"" in Italiano corretto ha un significato - oltretutto negativo - ben diverso dal verbo **""chiedere""** utilizzato da Giuseppe Piero Grillo (riporto il pezzo incriminato: *“Vi chiedo - ha scritto Grillo - di non proteggere più questa classe politica che ha portato l’Italia allo sfacelo, di non scortarli con le loro macchine blu o al supermercato, di non schierarsi davanti ai palazzi del potere infangati dalla corruzione e dal malaffare. Le forze dell’Ordine non meritano un ruolo così degradante”*).

In secondo luogo, nel suddetto testo non rilevo alcuna palese apologia di fatto contrario alla legge, anzi Giuseppe Piero Grillo si è parato il culo per bene con l'ultima frase (*""Le forze dell’Ordine non meritano un ruolo così degradante""*).

Per intenderci, tutto il testo di Giuseppe Piero Grillo è acqua di rose in confronto ai proclami delle Brigate Rosse, che contengono si' frasi pesantissime tipo ""disarticolare lo Stato"".

-Crime is actually very low on a per capita basis. And it's mostly concentrated to certain neighborhoods and areas.

Apparently EU member states retain their seat in the WTO. Are you lying?

*Original comment: 

I admit i don't know too much about the WTO, but i have a couple of remarks anyway. You are assuming that the interests of the UK and the EU at the WTO level are extremely different. Is that so? 

Moreover, you assume that the UK will have a lot of power in the WTO, while it would in fact become a negligible and therefore powerless player. (Unlike the the EU-parliament, where the UK has more or less 10% of the seats) Large countries tend to make alliances with interesting players to obtain their objectives. Smaller players are usually ignored by them, unless they happen to have a pivotal role, because it implies a lot of negotiations and very little gains.

You talk about the trade as a percentage of GDP, but what does that matter? You need external trade to survive unless you want to become an autarkist country. Moreover, according to [this document](http://www.parliament.uk/Templates/BriefingPapers/Pages/BPPdfDownload.aspx?bp-id=SN06211) (p9):

&gt; the tables also show how the **UK’s main export markets have shifted away from the Commonwealth countries to the EU Member States**. In 1960, Australia, Canada, South Africa, India and New Zealand were all ‘top ten’ markets for UK goods, accounting for one quarter of all UK exports of goods. By 1980, not one of these countries was a top ten export market and in 2011, India (the highest ranked Commonwealth country and ranked 13th) accounted for less than 2% of UK goods exports. Eight of the top ten goods export markets for the UK in 2011 were members of the EU. **The EU as a single ‘market’ accounted for 53% of all UK goods exports.**

Furthermore:

&gt; The importance of the EU to Norway, the UK and Switzerland as an export market has remained relatively constant since the beginning of the 1990s.

So i'm still pretty convinced that every company in the UK which does even a small amount of exporting will have to deal with EU regulations

Our society has evolved to rank masculinity much higher than anything else, and this idea exists of a binary which has an internal logic going something like: there are men and women, men are masculine, women are feminine, men are powerful and assertive, women are nurturing and passive, men fall in love with women, men have sex with women, and so on. Every stereotypical gender norm fits this pattern.

Of course, some of those things are true. But in our minds, they get connected and promoted to universals. Not all men are masculine (and what does it mean to be masculine anyway?), not all men fall in love with women, and so on. But then this logic gets applied to reality, and you end up with things like ""men who love other men must be feminine!"", and given the fact that masculinity is ranked higher than femininity, loving another man turns into something degrading and therefore shameful.

That's where homophobia comes from in our culture, and that's why there's a big overlap between feminists fighting misogyny and LGBT activists: It's fundamentally the same issue.

(Another term for the logic system described above is ""The Heterosexual Matrix"", invented by Judith Butler in [Gender Trouble (1990)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Trouble#Chapter_2._Prohibition.2C_Psychoanalysis.2C_and_the_Production_of_the_Heterosexual_Matrix)).",0,1386780801,null,0,false,0,cdz80mo,t3_1sl28r,t1_cdz80mo,t1_cdz1r69,null,1428269886,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Now he's dead due to tunnelvision. So cozy can consensus be.

&gt; If someone is actively recruiting children for sex trafficking you jail them, if they are doing the same for to fight ''Jihad'' you don't?

Sure. Yet for one there are still children being trafficked for sex even though it is outlawed. Second teenagers are quite unruly having their own ideas, if they are willing to whore themselves out or to go to Syria to kill the infidel, the resources for a foolproof system are lacking.

To be honest I'm a Muslim so I'm pissed off at terrorists appropriating that term. It makes everyone think that Jihad is to go and blow yourself up around civilians. They have totally ruined that word.

&gt;It isn't as clear-cut as you might believe. Some Chechens are devoutly muslim yet support the Kremlin-backed Kadyrov-clan and some Chechens are secular yet try to fight Russia and whereever they can. Tsarnayev, for instance, was in a secular Chechen group on vkontakte.

The islamist rebels in Abkhazia have always been pro-Russian. Currently they even made a pro-Assad Russian language tv station broadcast from the front. 

That is true but the Syrian government doesn't really accept most forgieners, especially people fighting with the zeal of Sunni Jihadists. The rebels are running 24/7 religious propaganda. This tends to get religious people to question why they are fighting against their ""brothers"". On the other hand they do accept Shia Jihadists because Al-Qaeda has been very brutal towards Shias. The shit AQ have done to innocent Shias is barbaric. Thats why Iraqis and Lebanese Shias have joined with the Syrian Army to kill these terrorists. They are quite effective too. They have the religious zeal of AQ, they defend innocent people from being beheaded and they're highly trained. 

There have also been reports of nonsyrian Arab Nationalists/Socialists and Nasserite (a secular political group in the ME) fighting with the Syrian Army. Their number is quite small and they aren't nuts like jihadis.

On the other hand there are probably Russian trainers and observers training the Syrian Army and watching how succesful they are against jihadists in an Urban environement.

Oh and ANNA News is run by ethnic Russians who probably aren't even from Abkhazia. I think one of them at least is.

Are you ill with essential verb means something like ""are you a pervert"", whereas are you ill with accidental meaning is just an innocent query about your health.

Our incarceration rates are a reflexion of how steep our penalties are and hardly a reflexion on the population. Ask Australia which tourist steals the most and get back to me on that. No remark about the cigarette butt comment? Don't give me the ""not all..."" argument. I think stealing and littering are so a thing of the past. A lot of Egyptian artifacts in the Louvre were stolen. This is not the aspect of the past that I like though.

I'm glad you confirmed and answered most of my points. We agree that Clermont-Ferrand is not a big city, but Paris is. CF no longer being a big city, is my part of my point. You seemed to want to contradict my point about the Polar-Paris idea by citing other large cities. Those cities pale in comparison to Paris. Again, where do the american tourists go?
You agree that it is normal that the french look towards more developed countries to express themselves. I bring this point up to throw a stick in the spokes of french ""nombrilisme"" because it takes the power away from the anti-american jokes. 

""You mean we are backwards because like every fucking country in the developped world we have been influenced by the 1st economical power of the world ? My god, such depth of analysis....(/s)""

Yes, exactly. Although, I wouldn't say ""backwards"" but ""50 years behind the US"" will do. I don't understand the sarcasm about that. Influence is a really good indicator isn't it? What do you do when you lack inspiration, you look towards someone who does. It doesn't need depth of analysis to see that and I don't see how that is controversial.

Yes, I've taken the train to Spain, Italy, and Switzerland and I've driven through Germany, Austria, and Hungary. What's your point? Yes, trains are non-existant or ineffective in the US. I got my driver's license when I was 16 and we use miles, and? Concerning that point, What I'm saying is that for a country to have access to efficient public transportation for so long, what's the deal with the sparseness? The on-going presence of those accents are the proof of this. 

You are right with your answer that you don't have the population despite la CAF. Before the US had large booming populations, individual states were much like France with a socialist party and a concern for the middle class, that was a long time ago. Time is linear, some time is ahead and some time is behind. Third-world countries are behind compared to second world countries like France. WW2 took place on your soil too, so that stunted a lot of growth.  

Would you agree that France is now trying to move in the direction that the US did a long time ago? 

Food is being increasingly industrialized in France, there's a decrease of local identity in terms of food and culture, increase in the reliance of cheap manual labor abroad. These are all things that France is now confronting, the old world vs the new world, hence my 50 year comment. France is now incorporated into the EU they are just now starting to think about building codes and food safety practices. I think that this is a good and a bad thing, but whichever it is, it is behind compared to the US.
No Mcdonalds is not only affective because of marketing and frenchified recipes, that's ridiculous that you think the french were cleverly tricked into it. The only frenchified thing there is the quality of the burger, the food is still garbage. It's popularity is a expression of the decline of the family dinner to support the on-the-go lifestle. It's appealing because it's easy. The kebab is very popular too for the same reasons. We started doing this in the 50's. Which country do the ""zones industrielles"" of your traditional cities resemble? I didn't come to live in France to see an imitation of my country while hearing anti-american sentiment.

You have your Air France, where's your google? These companies hire lots and lots of people. Your companies that hire lots of people are practically nationalized. France does not have an environment for encouraging entrepreneurship. It's as if France wants to modernize and internationalize, but can't for whatever reason. There are some people in France that want to work and try harder, and those people go to other countries. Those that don't mind that the social safety net will carry there weight for them will stay in France and keep it from growing; and to put it the way I said it, 50 years behind. If there's no incentive and no risk, there is no growth.


Your HDI comment is a very relevant point. It's not because we are ahead of you that we've perfected reality, I think that we messed up and that France hasn't caught up yet to really see this.
We do have a difference of ideologies about freedom.The american writor, Henry Thoreau said,""I would Rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowded on a velvet cushion.""I believe that most of the French would disagree, they would rather have their velvet cushion. The american appeal is that you can risk everything and can possibly gain something. In France, everyone and their possessions belongs to the State. We have a different concept of freedom, I agree with Thoreau. Risk takers should be rewarded, but they shouldn't be allowed to deprive others of wealth, no one found the right dose of govt intervention yet.

You may think of it as selfish and inhuman, but you fail to appreciate the darwinian aspect at work. I don't believe that people who lack drive and initiative should be rewarded by tax dollars, in France people can and do abuse the system, and while there are lots of poor people in US, neither side has figured it out yet.

I would feel safer in some third world countries than in some of the cités around any big city. That's the low end of what your social net can offer, and it's scary. There's a large disparity for young people that work and young people that don't work in France. At least in the US, creative and hardworking people (before 2008) were able to excel. Have you seen the homeless people outside of carrefour market and along the Saint Martin Canal? I didn't know what a ""manouche"" was before I came to France either. How is there HDI being dealt with? ",0,1386783581,null,0,false,0,cdz9a7g,t3_1sbfmg,t1_cdz9a7g,t1_cdz47pz,null,1428269295,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

You don't get to be at the WTO and argue a sovereign cause before the WTO by being in the EU, by virtue that you can't even negotiate you own trade deals outside the EU without going through it once you're in it.  Whereas if you're not, then you're not beholden.

If so, you are severely deluded.

It is far from normal to eliminate ""influence trafficking"" and ""abuse in an official dignity"" from the penal code. This just providing those in power the liberty to steal anything without any consequences. This law literally legalizes corruption.

On top of that here's some other stuff they try to sneak in during the holidays (hoping people won't notice ... ffs)
Change the law so that:
Stealing less than 100.000 euros would result in just a mention on the record.
Stealing 500.000 euros would be ok as long as you give half back if you get caught.
Release from jail all those that have less that 6 years of jail to serve if they were sentenced for illegal economic activities (you know, their buddies need to be home for holidays).

To address your politically motivated argument, I present one opposition mayor arrested and sentenced [by the same courts](http://www.nineoclock.ro/sorin-apostu-sentenced-to-3-years-and-6-months-in-jail-without-bail/) Many other similar example can be found.

Einige zwanzig Schritte weiter, in Richtung und Lage genau dem Seitenflügel entsprechend, lief eine ganz in kleinblättrigem Efeu stehende, nur an einer Stelle von einer kleinen weißgestrichenen Eisentür unterbrochene Kirchhofsmauer, hinter der der Hohen-Cremmener Schindelturm mit seinem blitzenden, weil neuerdings erst wieder vergoldeten Wetterhahn aufragte. Fronthaus, Seitenflügel und Kirchhofsmauer bildeten ein einen kleinen Ziergarten umschließendes Hufeisen, an dessen offener Seite man eines Teiches mit Wassersteg und angekettetem Boot und dicht daneben einer Schaukel gewahr wurde, deren horizontal gelegtes Brett zu Häupten und Füßen an je zwei Stricken hing – die Pfosten der Balkenlage schon etwas schief stehend.

The wing of the mansion looking toward the garden and park cast its broad shadow over a white and green checkered tile walk and extended out over a large round bed, with a sundial in its centre and a border of Indian shot and rhubarb. Some twenty paces further, and parallel to the wing of the house, there ran a churchyard wall, entirely covered with a small-leaved ivy, except at the place where an opening had been made for a little white iron gate. Behind this arose the shingled tower of Hohen-Cremmen, whose weather vane glistened in the sunshine, having only recently been regilded. The front of the house, the wing, and the churchyard wall formed, so to speak, a horseshoe, inclosing a small ornamental garden, at the open side of which was seen a pond, with a small footbridge and a tied-up boat. Close by was a swing, with its crossboard hanging from two ropes at either end, and its frame posts beginning to lean to one side.

It's clear you don't have an informed opinion. I mean, 'the UK would be able to have a say earlier and when it's most pertinent'...? What the fuck? This is a nonsensical sentence in this context, WTO negotiations aren't a race and they're not time sensitive. For a WTO negotiation to succeed, it has to be accepted by every single member. That means that the hundred-odd non-EU members have to agree, as well as the EU seat at the WTO **AND THE EU MEMBER STATES IN THE WTO**. The EU regularly consults with it's member states about negotiations in the WTO. If the UK was unhappy with the state of WTO negotiations, but everyone else was agreed, it could always prevent the deal going through. But it doesn't, because it conveys it's positions to the EU which helps to negotiate on it's behalf, because the negotiations have to reach consensus. There is no 'the UK would be able to say it earlier and when it's more pertinent'. That statement simply does not apply in any context in WTO negotiations, all viewpoints are addressed at any time and it doesn't matter if they're first, last, or what have you because you need unanimity to pass negotiations.

So basically, you're a downright rotten, dishonest scoundrel.

Trade negotiation has to go through an EU trade commissioner so any seat that is held by an EU member state is effectively disenfranchised in that it can't readdress what the EU says at the WTO.  Effectively the EU supplants whatever its members say at a WTO level - and as such everybody else on the WTO knows it.

Somewhat reluctant to keep talking to you since you were so quick to ask me if I was lying, and so quick to accept any counter argument however sparse (or bigoted), but to continue,

&gt;You talk about the trade as a percentage of GDP, but what does that matter? You need external trade to survive unless you want to become an autarkist country.

A great deal.    

There is no argument against there not being external trade.  The very opposite in fact.  The argument was that outside external trade in which the UK has no say over their domestic regulations is growing, whilst that of the EU (around 8%) is shrinking i.e. not having a say in direct regulations isn't a problem.

To address your original point I don't claim that the UK will 'hold a lot of power at the WTO', but I do maintain that the Anglosphere will, which the UK is obviously more in tune with.

Moreover your pdf?  Look up Rotterdam-Antwerp Effect.  It's closer to 40% and shrinking, which means ~8%.  Even if we take the 53% figure, that's still 10% of total GDP...

...and it's still not going anywhere.  We'd keep trading.

Yes.

Can you really say that the english vocabulary is closer to the frisian vocabulary than the dutch vocabulary is to german ? Really ?

The point I was trying to make was that many people confuse the classification of language by linguistics, and the actual impact of this classification on the ability to learn one or another language depending on what is your native language. 

For instance, having dutch as a native language will be a great help to learn german.

But speaking english won't really help you to learn dutch or german, and speaking dutch or german won't really help you to learn english.

Now, knowing french is probably the most valuable language to learn english. Why ? Simply because the two language share an absolutely gigantic part of their vocabulary and have a similar grammar on many points.

It means that there actually is a gigantic part of the english vocabulary that you don't need to learn if you're french, because it's already the same. You'll just have to learn the more basic germanic rooted words.

The Romanian parliament tries to put themselves, again, above the law to be able to siphon money from UE without any worries about legal consequences (these started to occur lately). Stupid morons like the one above, are driven by their personal hatred for a single individual, the current Romanian president, Traian Basescu, who has lots of petty flaws and can easily be a very polarizing person but has also been a fierce force for driving the country towards Western principles and practices.

Being morons, individuals like the one above were easily manipulated and haven been so for a couple of years by a large coalition of politicians that have been badly affected by the fact that lately the judicial system has started to do its job (lots of top-level corrupt politicians are now in jail or close to being thrown in jail for their deeds). The coalition is called USL and has been made by 3 parties, PSD (the main force, made up by ex-top-level communists), PNL (small but still significant force, made up by opportunistic ""Wild West""-style businessman led by the biggest joke of a human ever to have risen from Romanian politics, aka Crin Antonescu) and PC (made up basically by a single disgusting man, Dan Voiculescu, a cunning ex-top-level communist turned businessman and Berlusconi wannabe, owner of a large media corporation used to brain wash individuals like the one above).

So I say to you, fellow Europeans, beware that your money are close to being legally siphoned by Romanian politicians. I'm ashamed that retards like the one above exist in Romania but the truth is there are LOTS AND LOTS of them. Stupid right down to their very core, unable to reason and judge the big picture, manipulated into tunnel vision by their petty hate for a single person and being allowed to vote.

December 11, 2013

A basic tenet of democracy is that all people are equal under the law.

The amendments to the penal code passed yesterday in the Chamber of Deputies would represent a step backward for Romania.

It is very discouraging that these revisions were passed with no consultation, no debate, and no opportunity for judicial authorities or civil society to respond to the proposed amendments.

This move by the Parliament is a step away from transparency and rule-of-law and is a discouraging sign for investors, which will negatively affect Romania’s economy. Transparency, predictability and stability are critical factors for all investors, domestic and international, when they consider where to invest.

ONLY IT DOESN'T!

That's the whole point.  The EU isn't conveying UK interests.  You're even providing the argument that the EU can irrevocably undermine the UK position.  You're just imagining what the UK wants to fit you political agenda.  You just saying the EU argues the UK position regardless of the UK - but effectively conceding the point.


&gt;So basically, you're a downright rotten, dishonest scoundrel.

Bwahahahahaha!!!!

That depends on your native language.

If you are Dutch and have never took any English lesson, you'll still understand these words: King, nation, political party, film, castle, blink, bundle, commodore, sketch, smuggler, yacht, frolic, onslaught, landscape etcetera.

&gt; It means that there actually is a gigantic part of the english vocabulary that you don't need to learn if you're french, because it's already the same. You'll just have to learn the more basic germanic rooted words.

Nowadays any ""official"" changes in Spanish are made by this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Spanish_Language_Academies One of its aims is to keep Spanish in Spain and America ""united"". The United States is one of the members.

Don Quixote is one of the most influential books in history. It was one of the first, if not the first, book with a fictional plot and a protagonist far from a ""superhero"" thus starting the modern novel. It also helped to settle Spanish (Don Quixote talks in what can be called ""Old Spanish"" while the rest of the characters speak in a modern version and mock him).

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Freedom of speech in Germany means you can't wear or say certain things from the 30's.

It's a little more complicated than that. The lesson from the 1930's was that the democratic order can be overthrown from within the system itself. The consequence was that, when the new constitution was written, its authors took care to avoid flaws that can lead to instability or even could be abused as they had been during the Weimar Republic, and they included a mechanism to declare organisations that work towards abolishing the constitution and the democratic order illegal.  
The NSDAP and its subsidiary organisations are somewhat obvious examples of that, but they're not the only ones, the old communist party has been declared unconstitutional as well (although there are several other communist parties in Germany). Now it seems as if they'll have another go at declaring the neo-Nazi NPD unconstitutional. Whether this should be attempted again has been debated for years, because it's not an easy process and another failed attempt would only give them more publicity. If there was an organisation that worked towards, say, introducing an absolutist monarchy or a theocracy, it *could* be declared unconstitutional as well.

When an organisation is declared unconstitutional, its assets get seized, successor organisations are prohibited, and public display of its symbols becomes illegal (with exceptions, like original historic items, education and art). Declaring the NSDAP unconstitutional would have little effect if ""not at all successor, totally unrelated"" parties could still organise marches under swastika banners.

&gt; If someone is actively recruiting children for sex trafficking you jail them, if they are doing the same for to fight ''Jihad'' you don't?

We can jail them if they're recruiting for an organisation that has been categorised as a terrorist organisation, but what would be the basis for jailing them if all they (publicly) say is that you should go to Syria and become a fighter?  
""Jihad"" is not an organisation. It's not even well defined what it means, it's being interpreted as anything between a mental struggle with yourself to murdering anyone who doesn't follow the same particular flavour of Islam as whoever is calling for it. ""You know what they mean"" by itself is not convincing enough in a court.

true,chodechugging,ROMA,Romania,"Look, I don't care what the alternative is, Basescu is a cancerous element that should've been removed ages ago. His effect on the Romanian society has been nothing short of catastrophic. Regardless of his political contributions, which haven't been beneficial at all, neither when analyzed in a vacuum nor when compared to anything else, he has single handedly ruined a vital element in the Romanian collective consciousness. 

The idea of what a politician is has been turned on its head in Romania. Basescu's countless antics, whether it's stealing cell phones, lying about smacking children or literally painting targets on private citizens by calling them ""jailable"", all of these things have corrupted people's minds when it comes to what a politician actually is, what his job entails, what he can do and what he *can't* do. Currently there are very few places in the civilized world where things relating to politics are more poorly understood. This is a DEAD SERIOUS issue! It transcends left vs right or EU vs Russia. It's like having brain AIDS. I don't know how old you are or how accurately you remember the 90s, but things were completely different back then. Despite people being much poorer and despite not having any ties with the west, the difference in public discourse was like night and day. Look up any talk show or public statement from the 90s, it sounds like another country. Back then people didn't consider the president, and by association all politicians to be showmen, gypsy tribe leaders, stand up comedians, medieval knights or the guys you have a couple of beers with. 

That all changed when Basescu appeared and began to act as a nexus for the worst facets of post communist Romania. You could call it esotericism all you want. People's psychology is one of the most important elements of any society of any kind. And Basescu has ruined Romania's psychology. Of course, that's not *all* he's guilty of, but that's the most heinous thing he did. And that's more than enough to warrant his removal.

Those include science specific words and those shouldn't be counted as they didn't evolve, they were invented. And it only matters if you're learning posh English or Scientific English, not standard English.

Some of these words don't come from French but okay. Here are some more Germanic words.

&gt; I send you back to the previous link in the first part of my post. 26% for germanic language, 29% for french language and 29% from latin (and french being so close to latin... well you understand.)

Your source by the way, agrees with me. Your source states that the majority of the words come from Germanic. Scientific, mathematical and philosophical words come from Latin and Greek. 

French is more used in advanced conversations. Germanic words are the most used words. If we look at the percentage of words a person uses, the vast majority is Germanic.

Do you think the gap between north and south in your country is because of laziness? it's because while the north benefited from technological developments that improved productivity, the south remained a rural mess, where private investors where to afraid to go and government investment was diverted to the local mobs.

Theismus als Geisteskrankheit zu bezeichnen ist nicht nur respeklos sondern auch falsch. Wenn überhaupt ist es ein Trugschluss.

&gt;Das ist nicht mutig, sondern Realität. Die Begrifflichkeiten von Gott, Göttern, Religion etc. sind so beliebig/verschieden, dass man davon ausgehen kann, dass Babys keiner dieser Begrifflichkeiten ""von Natur aus"" anhängen.

Du sagst also ""Es ist nicht geklärt was Gott überhaupt meint, aber Babies glauben bestimmt nicht drann"". Das macht überhaupt keinen Sinn. 

&gt;Und das wiederum ist unwahrscheinlich, weil diese irrationale Deutung nur von außen kommen könnte

Nach der Premisse wären Menschen nicht zum Trugschluss fähig, was - deiner Argumentation zu Folge - dazu führen würde, dass Religionen gar nicht erst entstehen könnten oder von außen gegeben sein müssten. Menschen, also auch Neugeborene, sind irrational. Sie machen Trugschlüsse. Nur weil sich jemand ohne äußeren Einfluss eine Meinung gebildet hat, heißt das nicht, dass diese richtig sein muss.

&gt;Babys - als souveräne Entität betrachtet - können Schlüsse nur aus ihren Erfahrungen ziehen. 

Babies werden dadurch Dinge die sie nicht verstehen u.U. höheren Mächten zuschreiben. Bedeutet das nun das sie recht haben? Schließlich sind sie doch souveräne Entitäten?!

&gt;Das heißt aber nicht, dass die Chance 50:50 ist. Ich kann auch nicht beweisen, dass meine Nachbarn keinen Elefanten in ihrem Schlafzimmer halten. Es ist nur eben sehr, sehr unwahrscheinlich.

Die Chancen können wir überhaupt nicht abschätzen. Deshalb wird ja auch über Ockham's Razor argumentiert, da man hierfür die Wahrscheinlichkeiten nicht kennen muss. Die Existenz einer Gottheit ist weder wahrscheinlich noch unwahrscheinlich. Keine der beiden Hypothesen ist beweisbar oder falsifizierbar, daher ist die einfachere zu wählen.

&gt;Demokratie unterscheidet sich von Göttern und rosa Einhörnern dadurch, dass sie nachweislich existiert. Babys könnten also Befürworter der Demokratie sein. 

Aber dann könnten wir ja auch annehmen, ""dass meine Nachbarn keinen Elefanten in ihrem Schlafzimmer halten. Es ist nur eben sehr, sehr unwahrscheinlich.""

true,JasonYamel,UKRA,Ukraine,"&gt;Come on, everyone knows what that flag means and what kind of people wave it, you are not fooling anyone.

You're simply misinformed, that's about the only way I can put it. See the lyrics of this song for example, written in the 1960s in the Soviet Ukraine: http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8

The kind of people that wave it are people who support and honour what UPA stood for, without necessarily condoning the crimes its insurgents committed during WW2. They do not associate UPA with any kind of neo-Nazi ideology and do not agree to that ideology in the slightest. That may not be everyone, but I'm describing the vast majority of people who like, support, wave the Red-black flag. I'm not telling you that they're right or wrong, I'm just giving you information about how it is right now. It's really not up to you, Russian propagandists *or* neo-Nazis to take that symbol away from them.

&gt; The very ideology of nationalism predisposes to this kind of atrocities (unlike Communism).

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I'd also need references for this one, given that Denmark and Holland seem to have antibiotic reduction programmes

Yes, they do, but the EU does not, nor do they want to. We have one of the oldest in the world in fact, but it is not in any way reflected in the price in our cows. 

[Link about *some* antibiotics use, from a few countries, not the south or France of course](http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/news/press_room_34_846139138.pdf).

[Here is a general sheet on the use of antibiotics. As a general rule, north use less than south](http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/eaad/documents/eaad-2011-summary-antimicrobial-consumption-data.pdf). Why is that not premiered? 

Another link. As you say, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark. But are we getting recognition for that reflected in our prices? No, not at all.Is that *EU being environmental friendly that you are talking abut*? If they are - why not give our more money for our excellent programs. It is agriculture-  What does it help if it costs us more but the EU does not reflect it in our prices? Why don't the EU care? 


&gt;I just find this one weird. Can you point to relevant legislation or official FAQs of some kind?

I know, it is. It has to do with that you calculate the subsidies for what the cow graze on. It was done with France as a model. So, iif you have an area that looks like this [Link](http://www.google.se/imgres?client=firefox-a&amp;hs=egq&amp;rls=org.mozilla:sv-SE:official&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=457&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=cpVEpEV74u6QpM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://se.dreamstime.com/arkivbild-tarine-ko-i-de-franska-fjllngarna-image35019902&amp;docid=TyhIfDvpjtCzbM&amp;itg=1&amp;imgurl=http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/tarine-ko-i-de-franska-fjllngarna-35019902.jpg&amp;w=1300&amp;h=951&amp;ei=M7eoUuOuDo3zyAPXjoGYBQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;ved=1t:3588,r:0,s:0,i:79&amp;iact=rc&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=166&amp;tbnw=224&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=9&amp;tx=130&amp;ty=44), you get more money than if it looks like [this - Sweden](http://www.skolvision.se/SVWebNkA/0%20NkBok%20bilder%20i%20sidordning/s94-ko-i-hage.jpg),  since it has more trees. The cows are out as much, are as healthy, eat a more varied diet (cows are actually supposed to eat fresh leaves and stuff) less antibiotics etc, but we still get less money, because of the trees. The problem is - we can't do anything about the trees. Apart from far up in the mountains, on cliffs and in Skåne, everything is bloody trees. We have a problem with too much trees, we don't have enough animals to keep it open. Of course, the fact that there is no *science* behind it and we have been pointing it out since 1995 doesn't face the EU in the slightest, nor that we can't change the nature of our landscape. We are a forrest country. I could face getting less for a cow if it for example spent more time indoors due to the climate- that is fair, then you think about how the cow live (we have to have our cows indoors some months of the year, otherwise we are cruel to them, but the French have their cows indoor to)but our cows are not worse of because of more trees. We are not putting them in a bloody Amazon jungle. Basically, the EU says our grazing land should get less money. But, the EU have not science to back it up with, none at all. That is EU for me - working against science and evidence. 


&gt;I don't think it's necessarily endless. And I can't necessarily answer your questions, because some of them only you can answer. I don't have any problem at all in agreeing that Greece has fucked up awesomely, and that letting Greece into both the EU and the eurozone were poor decisions in purely financial terms.

Come on - at the end of 2020, Greece will have received money for 38 years, Portugal and Spain for 33. It is a whole bloody generation, and we both now it will not end by 2020. Is that OK by you? How many decades more? I think, and I *know* that countries who choose to can change in a generation (look at Poland, Estonia, China, South Korea, Brazil etc - why the fuck is Greece not changing?)However, you, and the EU think 40-50 years, at least, is OK. I think it is outrageous that you think that, it is so fucking wrong. How can you defend that? How can the EU? What makes the south so fucking special that they should be sponsored forever? Why can't they change? 

What the EU has done is taken in countries that are permanent bottomles money pits, and they are not changing. I think that is wrong, and I do not set up my future children for that. The countries have had ample time to change- but they are not. 


&gt;I don't have a compelling argument with respect to Greece, and I'd agree your points with respect to aid and aid dependency. 

So I am right, Greece is a dependent on our money and not developing, an endless money pit. Then the EU shoud say NO!, but they don't. I do not accept to be in a union that is so careless with to whom they give money, and don't care how they spend it. 

&gt;However, aid dependency isn't a guaranteed outcome, since, as I said, Ireland went from net recipient to net payer.

No, you are a net recipient again, aren't you? Besides, you have a different culture than the south, you are not as corrupt. 

&gt;Greece's sovereign debt, as I've already pointed out, is unrelated to ongoing EU funding. Countries can become net payers with high debt/GDP ratios, as Italy is, for example. Also as I said, Sweden is not involved in Greek debt aid through the EFSF or ESM, because those are eurozone initiatives. 

Sigh, we are. World Bank, + emergency EU programs for the bottomless south. And, what more, they have fucked up so massively that they are not even near becoming net payers. So, because their debts, corruption and fuckups, *we* have to pay money for them for decades to come. How does that not concern me? 

&gt;Overall, the answer is probably yes. It's not the same as aid to most countries - EU subsidies are much more targeted and much more overseen.

I am sorry, you are so wrong, and I have evidence for it. If it worked - why are Portugal, Greece and Spain still so fucked up? You will have to give me scientific proof of what you are saying. I see absolutely no reason to believe you against fact- this is what you want to believe, not the truth, is it? I have access to academic journals, so please post links why it works (against the clear evidence) and how it so much better than other aid. 

If you can't provide that it is not true and the EU are willfully throwing our money in a bottomless pit against scientific evidence and will be doing that for decades to come.Why would anyone want to be in a union like that? 


&gt;If they're being targeted at things that will make a positive difference to Greece (and they were in Ireland), then they're worth continuing, because Greece would be worse off without them. And the world's environment would be that much worse off in turn.

If they are working, and Greece have been receiving them since 1981, why are Greece in the state it is in. If they structural funds aren't working, why keep them? If the CAP isn't working, why keep it? 

&gt;It comes down to whether you feel sufficient sympathy with the Greek people to think that they deserve your assistance or not, which is something you should probably consider in the light of exactly how much assistance you actually give them, which averages about €20.21/year per adult Swede from 2000-2011 (I should probably thank you at this point for the €4.77 per year each adult Swede has contributed to Ireland over the same period). 

A) We have contributed more to Ireland, we helped with your bailout. 

B) Why should I feel sympathy with a country who has done nothing to improve themselves, constantly cheat, lie and are corrupt, vote for less taxes and  corrupt politicians. I have much more sympathy for Iceland, Ruwanda (genocide), Estonia, or countries that are attempting to change. The Greeks are not. And, as we said, the aid the EU is giving them is actually helping them *not* to change. 

And, as for the environment - ha! Please. You are acting under the assumption that Greece is doing anything for the environment. I can link to so many directives they don't care about, how they willfully screw things up, ruin stuff. [Here](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;jur=C,T,F&amp;num=C-264/07&amp;td=ALL) for example is a warning how they haven't implemented the urban waste water report of the EU directives. Please note that it was before the crises, and they were five years late. They get stuff like that every day, they don't give a shit. 


And, apart from the environment, several African states have complained at the Eurozone that just because oneof their members is fucked up they get a better deal a more money than they do. That is true btw. So, in terms of global recognition, Greece and the south help to fuck up Europe's reputation - what is that costing us?

So, all I see is a union that is discriminating us,  ignores glaring problems like the fact that the south is a bottomless pit that shouldn't receive another cent, that the structural fund doesn't work - but they still want our money, for decades to come I do not want to be in a union that is so careless with my money, and don't care how countries spend them - for decades. How can you claim that is good to be in a union that just spend your money, carelessly? And, they want more power, more of our money while simoultaneously being more corrupt and paying less taxes.  I am not setting up my children for that, and I am so fucking tired of it. 

If the EU wanted change, they should stop sponsoring the south, and put a time limit for how long one can leech and bleed other countries, before gettings ones act together. They are not of course. Why should they - the more populous south have no incentive to change and will never vote for it. And they outnumber us. All one can do is run.

Yes, because anyone who know the *first thing* about one's own national history knows that no nation or culture is much to be proud of. Pride? Did you create it? It's just there. If you want to take credit for your history, do you take credit for the bloodshed as well? For the senseless barbarism and wars?

So yes, anyone bold enough to claim ""pride"" in his nation is necessarily an ignorant idiot.

&gt; our ancestors did not form our countries so we could toss it away within a generation to build an ultra-capitalist machine ""global society"" that only benefits non-natives and sole purpose is to destroy the heritage and way of life of our European nationality

You've got like at least 4 or 5 fear-based conspiracies in there, I'm not sure I can follow.

1. You're afraid of losing the nation state. Well, your ancestors didn't build that. The lords of your ancestors did, for their personal gain.

2. You're afraid of this ""ultra-capitalism"" that nobody is proposing.

3. You're afraid of a global society. Why? What's do fragile about your culture that you can't handle interaction with other cultures? Also, how exactly is it possible to benefit ""only non-natives"", seeing as how you're a non-native in a majority of the planet's nations?

4. You're afraid of losing your way of life. Kind of like how you lost your way of life when you got the Internet or telephones, I suppose? The world changes, you either choose to change it for the better, or you stick with an idea of a world that never existed in the first place.

Your proto-fascist views are shared by about 12% of my countrymen. Sadly, a far higher number of supporters exist in Greece, most likely due to understandable widespread panic. Someone failed in building a stable nation that Greeks deserve, and now we have the result: The roots of fascism are once again grabbing hold on Greek soil. The only thing that can be done is to invest in Greek education and infrastructure to build a society that can give Greece hope for the future, and perhaps join the modern world with pride and confidence in their own culture, instead of this pathetic display of emotion.",0,1386791652,null,0,false,0,cdzd71e,t3_1smgc9,t1_cdzd71e,t1_cdza240,null,1428267398,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

The reverse is true. Building in zero-g is ridiculously easier, but most importantly, importing and exporting resources is energetically cheaper by orders of magnitude.

&gt;There's literally hundreds of gigantic lists filled with the inventions we use everyday that were created in the space industry, including human spaceflight.

The only knowledge gained from human space flights is related to effects on space flight on humans. Perhaps useful, but it's enough to research this on Earth's orbit.

&gt;Human spaceflight gives research a legitimate goal and reason and thus will greatly encourage it.

It may be the goal, but there's no technology for it to make sense, yet.  

&gt;People and companies will not develop new technology if it doesn't do anything.

People and companies will develop new technology if it makes economic sense.

Great, except there's absolutely no need for humans there.

Who did you accuse of not having basic knowledge again? Building in -0g is not easy. It tooks astronauts/Cosmonauts years to build MIR and ISS. Human on a surface with gravity do it much easier, with much less costs. 

Also, not building such a space station, but making it right is the hard part. Building a space station is not hard, building a space station with artificial gravity is.

Now you're suddenly saying:

You are saying here that human spaceflight is useful and thus it doesn't say anything against my point.

Again, you're speaking in riddles. To make sense of what? Colonization, Human spaceflight? And how does this related in anything to what you're saying?

true,TheByzantineDragon,FRIE,Fryslân (Living in Overijssel),"Well the similarity between Frisian and English is mostly phonetically. Written Frisian is heavily influenced by Dutch and it has consonant combinations that are impossible in English.

A nice sample phrase is (Which is partially understood written): 
&gt; Bûtter, brea en griene tsiis, is goed Engelsk en goed Frysk.

Û is pronounced like a German Ü. EA is pronounced as how you would in English. The G is just like in English. IE is pronounced like a double EE in English and so is II. OE is pronounced like the English OO.

&gt; I can barely see any resemblance to English. And even looking at a Frisian dictionary it all seems a lot closer to Dutch/German than English.

That is because Frisian is in fact closer to Dutch then it is to English. Frisian language has been repressed since the renaissance when the Lowland became one republic, and afterwards a kingdom. Dutch was the language for civilized men, Frisian was for farmers. This heavily influenced Frisian It wasn't until the late 1900's and 20th century that Frisian became prominent again and only since a few decades it is taught in schools.

Thanks to this, Frisian is much closer to Dutch, than it is to English but it's still more like English than any other language. (Except for Scots, but Scots comes from English)",0,1386795077,null,0,false,0,cdzew5f,t3_1smyz6,t1_cdzew5f,t1_cdzecpp,null,1428266606,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"This all started when stonus said the UK would suffer lessened influence if it left the EU. You brought up the WTO as an example of how the UK would gain more influence 'because it doesn't have a seat in the WTO' as part of the EU. I proved you wrong. You said I was splitting hairs, ignoring the fact that there is considerably more to having a seat in the WTO than just negotiating the next round of talks. It's not splitting hairs, there is a massive fundamental fucking difference if you knew what you were talking about with your 'informed opinion' (I think we've already established that was a joke). 

Now you're backpedaling once more saying that your point from the beginning was that the UK would be able to negotiate it's own trade deals. So either you mean negotiating it's own FTAs and such, in which case why bring up the WTO? But I'll concede that whilst you're an intellectual nobody, you're probably not quite *that* stupid. Or, you mean the UK would be better able to represent it's interests in the WTO. In a strictly technical sense, sure, the UK probably can best say what the UK wants. In an outcomes sense (and this is where the original argument of 'the UK would have less influence globally' comes in), then no. You really think the UK is better off arguing trade negotiations outside of the largest market in the world, than inside? You think the UK will be bigger consensus builders in WTO negotiations than the EU? You are downright fucking mental if that's what you believe, it flies in the face of all relevant international negotiation and international power theories, not to mention it makes coming to a reasonable negotiated consensus within the WTO that much harder to come by.

That you think the UK doesn't represent the UK demos is amusing in the extreme as well. Who do they represent? Majestic 12? The global shadow government? Margaret Thatchers rotting corpse that still rules England with an iron grip?

&gt;Nope.
Didn't say that either. That's you 'outright lying'.

This comes from you butchering the english language, as you are so wont to do. You have no ability to effectively and accurately convey your point across. One need only look at [this stunning display of blather](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1smhrd/the_official_european_elections_2014_website_in/cdzajao) to understand that. It's no wonder I misunderstood the point you were trying to argue. But wait, no I wasn't lying there, and I didn't misunderstand. Because in that travesty of a post you did say that through these gems

&gt;That's the whole point. The EU isn't conveying UK interests

and 

&gt;Of course you know that there are negotiations around any deal between signatories, and that an EU member state is effectively excluded because it matters what the EU delegation agrees, but you'll pretend they don't exist and that doesn't happen either...

Grillo ha *istigato la violenza nei confronti delle istituzioni*, e andrebbe messo in galera SUBITO. Non ho intenzione di vivere e far vivere ai miei figli il ""Fascismo 2.0"", anche se di fascismo non si tratta ma si tratta magari di forconismo o grillismo o qualsivoglia altro tipo di dittatura. No. Io sono nato in un paese *libero*, *democratico* e con *tanti, troppi difetti*, ma rifiuterò **SEMPRE** la violenza per risolvere i problemi della nazione.

Nobody cared about us until the fall of the soviet union, we where lost to communism. The US was busy preventing other nations turning red to care about us. Poland, the Czech republic and Hungary are proof, all of their attempts at liberty where squashed because nobody cared. Belarus, Georgia and N Korea are modern examples... there is no difference between a man born in Venice or Vladivostock...despite being condemned from the start with very different chances at a fulfilled life.

I'm not a sociologist but from an economic stand point I can assure you that money plays a large part, large scale investment generates jobs that encourage parents to send their children to school. Educated people and money are essential for the development of private businesses witch develops into more jobs, more money(in fact the speed of money is increased) more business opportunities and so on.
Up until now trade is the only way to boost a national economy without systemic downsides(inflation, deflation or stagflation). Worst case scenario it generates jobs(China) that can boost a economy by themself in some cases(India, Vietnam). Now on the aspect of religion, it by itself doesn't make you poor, and I heard about a study that actually links poverty to religion so a correlation is definitely possible but i very much doubt causality.

Compare what the living standard of a Norwegian with that of a Saudi, and Saudi Arabia has a lot more oil income. I was challenging disparity of wealth not the wealth of the country. 

Yes it can be, if there are circumstances for that change. And while the diplomatic effort to change a country is very high, giving immigrants a fair change is the best our society(western society not particularly Italy) has come up with.

Bad example..the french revolution actually was a consequence of Napoleons rule. And the only reason Napoleon gave the peasants rights was to convince them to enroll in his army.

If you look objectively at nationalism you see that its quite stupid and unfair for ordinary people. Before nationalism people weren't affected by the changes in authority their land was going to, after nationalism ordinary people where manipulated to fight and die to keep their rulers and the bourgeoisie interests safe for a fraction of the cost of a mercenary.

However this probably wont be the case because all of them require a long term increase in the amount of money which is put into language education. I think we should increase the amount we spend on language education, but as it stands we wont. 

However I think that if we were to take advantage of new technology and techniques that it need not be necessary to increase the funding dramatically, or at least not increase the funding indefinitely.

By this I mean we could be taking advantage of the internet to connect students to native speakers, memorisation games to help take the monotony out of memorisation (memorise.com comes to mind). Even some old innovations could be more used. Languages aren't very well suited to being learned mainly through the classroom which is why we need to make a more immerse experience using technology. Why don't the teachers prescribe more foreign language films to watch?

true,Vaeldr,ITAL,Italy,"There are huge historical differences. First of all Italy was never united. Sure, Romans made it their favorite peninsula but they didn't unite it. The South was a the time truly a place of great culture, being Greek colonies. Italia Cisalpina was inhabited by Celtic and Germanic tribes. Also called Gallia Cisalpina. Then, when Rome fell all of Italy was invaded by barbarians but a huge part of them actually settled in the North and only raided the South. Lombards, Venetians, Goths. They settled in the North of Italy and today we even have regions named after them. Of course Latin, being a great language replaced their Germanic languages but that never quite broke the bond. The reason for this settling is that the Padana valley is very fertile and also it's very protected-the Adriatic to the East, the Alps to the North, the Appeninnes to the South and West. In other words a perfect location to settle. Meanwhile the South had it's kingdoms who were very dependent to the Pope. Sicily belonged to the Arabs. Meanwhile the North was part of the Holy Roman Empire, had republics or was part of Austria-Hungary later on. While the North was ruled by Austria, the South was ruled by Spain. One has a different impact than the other. Seeing as the two parts had completely different development it's normal that they live very differently to this day. People even look different for God's sake. Italy as country isn't even 200 years old. Of course there is huge impact on today's Italy. We are talking about thousands of years.

Yes, attempts have been smashed. Just like the attempts of Italians to free themselves from foreigners. Eventually Italians and Romanians succeeded. I honestly do not see what point you're trying to make with your trade argument.

As for disparity of wealth just look at the UAE. They are filthy rich. You just see Ferraris and Lambos on the streets. You don't see that in Italy.

I do not want immigrants here because this is my home. I'm doing well enough without them and they are a burden to society.

As for nationalism it's beneficial.

It is the choice of the EU. It's a union to improve cross cultural ties and the economic betterment of it's citizen. It's not a union to push specific policies that serve the US. The geopolitics the EU gets involved in is the stuff that matter to it's constituent members. Meddling in the affairs of other countries. If Ukrainians are going to join the EU, then they have to make the conscience choice to do so. ALL of them, just as the Serbians have done. Otherwise it's a recipe for disaster.

&gt;While the EU is clearly allied to the US in terms of world view, it's a separate entity. It is in the EU's interest to have an allied Ukraine, much more so than for the US.

Having Ukraine is in the interest of the EU. However having a divided Ukraine isn't. Ukrainians should sort their internal divisions before joining the EU. Ukraine should take the path of Moldova. Convince the majority that the EU is better for them, then win elections and then start the process. So far you have one political block in Ukraine pushing for the EU while the other isn't. Unfortunately the side that isn't fussed about the EU is the one that is in charge. The EU should respect that.

I never said anything about university. That should remain merit-based. I'm talking about schools - primary and secondary. If a migrant kid has a brain and good schooling (which every kid deserves), then they should have no problem getting into uni or getting a good job on their own merit.

Well, you can take that view, but you'll just be unhappy all the time.

better than or in some way too special to share some things with people from France, Germany, Belgium, Italy or Denmark."" Either that or if you believe UKIP when they claim that every country would be better off alone, it sounds eerily similar to ""separate but equal."" It's just nasty.

2) A UK exit would weaken the Union as a whole so I don't want that.

3) At the same time, UKIP is lying about/misrepresenting many things and a UK exit would, in fact, be bad for Britain. But I don't want bad things to happen to Britain. Just because some people in Britain might not see me as a fellow European I do see them as such and I wish them no harm.

It's part of the Conservative ideology to see society as smattered with  different kinds of people all in a hierarchy. Translators have an important roll in that hierarchy and we need people to fill that roll. As it stands being a translator is not a bad job at all. It's not the same calibre as being a states man, but just because you're not a statesman doesn't mean you're not fulfilling an important and profitable function. 

Additionally whilst David Cameron has personally managed to make it to top office without appearing to need French (I'm uncertain of this, but let's suppose) that does not mean that it wouldn't have been easier if he did have those skills. Life is a lot easier if you have a wider variety of skills, and languages, for many people, are very useful skills indeed. Furthermore, speaking mandarin will be an increasingly more important skill as time marches on and being able to speak it will become increasingly more of a necessity to gaining top offices in public and private sector. So whilst politicians of today might find it easily manageable to obtain top offices without language skills, that might not necessarily be true in future as Mandarin takes a firmer grip.

I went there back in May and spoke to a few of my Belgian friends and it's strange - the impression I get from them is that they all see it as a foregone conclusion, but no one seems to know when or how it will happen. Just that it will. It makes the most sense from my perspective for Flanders to join the Netherlands, for Wallonia to join France, for the German bits to join Germany, and for Brussels to become a European Capital Region or something to that effect.

That being said, there are many problems with that. One thing people keep bringing up is that the EU simply does not have the resources or experience to actually govern a rather large city. Not only that, but then there's questions of citizenship rights to those who live in Brussels - sure, some of them will retain their previous nationalities, but what about stateless people, or people born after several generations? Will there be a default 'European Union' passport that gets created for Brussels?

To me, however, making Brussels a capital region makes the most sense, as it would be too difficult to negotiate a clean split along the linguistic border and then fight about whether or not Netherlands gets Brussels, or France gets Brussels, in which case a small connection between Brussels and France would have to be created, otherwise it would remain as a French exclave within the Netherlands, which seems stupid. Also, who's to say that the Netherlands would definitely willingly take on Flanders? I've heard plenty of Dutch people say that they're not too enamoured by the idea. France seems more prepared to take on Wallonia however. There's also the question of what would happen to the Belgian royal family - could they remain over a part of the country (more likely if one of the sections went for outright independence rather than joining a neighbouring country), or could they loom over Brussels (which seems unlikely in an EU capital)?

Differences in pronunciation (the scope of which we can't know entirely, especially among vowels) certainly do exist- the letters β, δ, γ, &amp; φ, θ, χ all changed their sounds.  The first three, pronounced in ancient greek as /b/ (as in bag,) /d/ (as in dog) and /g/ (as in game,) have shifted in modern greek to /v/ (vat,) /δ/ (this,) and /γ/ (no english equivalent, but think of a voiced equivalent to german ""ch,"") while the other three have shifted from ""p^h "" (aspirated p sound, think of p before the vowel ""i,"" as in ""pitch,"")  ""t^h "" (same with t) and  ""k^h "" (same) to /f/, /θ/ (as in ""thin,"") and /x/ (german ch sound.)  
An enormous amount of the vocabulary is the same, though.  Modern greek as a language is really something of a synthesis of demotic greek (what people speak colloquially) and an older, more conservative register of the language called Katharevousa that was the official standard until the mid-70s.  

How easy would it be for a modern educated greek speaker to read homer?  I'm not sure.  But for an english analogy, think Chaucer, not Beowulf.

The spelling was pretty much standardised near 300 AD. Since then, we only changed the stress marks we use, and the spelling of some grammatical suffixes that were no longer the same as in Ancient Greek. The spelling reform was a gradual process in the 1970s-1980s. 

Modern Greek, as far as grammar and vocabulary is concerned, was standardised early 19th century, in the form of [Katharevousa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharevousa), a language that was created to ""feel"" like Ancient Greek while pronounced with the modern phonology (no-one spoke it natively, and it was a patchwork of different stages of ancient Greek, with some awkward results because of the phonological changes - eg the Katharevousa words for ""you (pl)"" and ""us"" sound exactly the same, because the vowels that they used in Ancient Greek merged in modern pronunciation).

Näheres zu Burson-Marsteller, der PR-Firma, die diese Infotainmentveranstaltung verbockt hat:

&gt; Die Burson-Marsteller GmbH ist Mitglied im [Netzwerk Europäische Bewegung](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netzwerk_Europ%C3%A4ische_Bewegung).

&gt;Das Unternehmen wird u.a. dafür kritisiert, dass es die Öffentlichkeitsarbeit verschiedener Regimes und Diktaturen betreute, so zum Beispiel die argentinische Militärjunta oder das Regime des rumänischen Diktators Nicolae Ceaușescu. Laut Nina Katzemich von Lobbycontrol würde das Unternehmen vor nichts zurückschrecken. B-M erhalte auch durch die Zusammenarbeit mit EU-Regierungen „zahlreiche neue privilegierte Zugänge“, die sich „bei weiteren Aufträgen von Kunden aus der Privatwirtschaft zu Geld“ machen lassen würden. So habe sich die Agentur beispielsweise während der polnischen EU-Ratspräsidentschaft als Berater der polnischen Regierung dafür eingesetzt, Fracking nicht EU-weit zu regulieren, sondern zu fördern. Gleichzeitig war der Ölkonzern ExxonMobil Kunde von B-M, welcher in Polen Fracking betreibt.[6]

&gt; Burson-Marsteller stand außerdem schon oft im Visier von Umweltschützern, die dem Unternehmen vorwerfen, im Auftrag von Großunternehmen Propaganda für umweltzerstörerische und gesundheitsschädliche Projekte und Techniken zu betreiben.[7] So half B-M bei der Gründung der Global Climate Coalition, einem Interessenverband, dessen Ziel es war, staatliche Maßnahmen zur Senkung der Emission von Kohlendioxid zu verhindern.[8]

&gt; Burson-Marsteller geriet auch in die Kritik durch den Einsatz des sogenannten Astroturfing, bei denen der Eindruck einer spontanen Graswurzelbewegung vorgetäuscht wird. So heuerte Burson-Marsteller 1999 eine Gruppe von Demonstranten an, die im Auftrag des Biotech-Unternehmens Monsanto für den Einsatz von Genmanipulation protestieren sollten. Der Vorfall wurde nach einem Bericht der New York Times bekannt, die einige der Demonstranten interviewt hatte.[9][10][11]

&gt; Im Mai 2011 wurde bekannt, dass Burson-Marsteller USA einen verdeckten Auftrag von Facebook für eine Kampagne gegen Google mit Hilfe scheinbar neutraler Presseberichte angenommen hatte.[12][13][14] So wurde etwa ein bekannter US-amerikanischer Aktivist für Privatsphäre von B-M anonym angeschrieben und gebeten, einen Google-kritischen Gastkommentar in verschiedenen großen Zeitungen zu schreiben.[15]

&gt; Auch wurde Burson-Marsteller von der Fraport AG, Lufthansa AG sowie Condor Flugdienst beauftragt, eine Gegeninitiative zu den Fluglärmprotesten am Frankfurter Flughafen zu starten. Die sollte in Form einer Gegendemonstration unter dem Motto Ja zu FRA! erfolgen.[16] Die Bürgerinitiative Luftverkehr Offenbach bezeichnete die Zusammenarbeit als „skandalös“.",0,1386814567,null,0,false,0,cdznu1f,t3_1soave,t1_cdznu1f,t3_1soave,null,1428262365,4,false,de,t5_22i0,4
