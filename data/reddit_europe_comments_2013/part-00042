I am centrist leaning so I may be biased, but you realize that Pasok, the bad, ugly, populist, fucked up, arbitrary, and corrupted to the core part, has actually fully migrated to Syriza? And from that standpoint they continue their normal operation of talking out their arse and justifying the public sector's comparatively unfair economic privilleges that have crippled the rest of the economy?

Suppose that some, objective as fuck, agency, identifies that some 2000 people in the tax collecting service or something, are corrupt, accept bribes, have made tons of personal wealth, keep their mouths shut as some semi private corporation with close ties to the government loans public money for ""construction work"" that never gets made, and are eventually the people that make it prohibitive for greeks and foreigners to carry out investments without some ridiculously good incentive that will still sound kinda like a risk. So the agency proposes that they'll all get fired and some of them even put in jail. What do you expect Syriza's reaction will be like? They'll cover them, no matter how clear the evidence is, Syriza will start claiming that they are workers of the proletariat and that 10-20 politicians are responsible for everything, something vague about the banks etc. And that's because Syriza are not the radical left, in fact they are the very core and the most dishonest part of the system. If you are under the impression that they'll ever ""leave the Euro"" as they hint, then I can only laugh, their main goal is ""money to the public sector without any sort of meritocracy"", they'd run like chicken if the threat of actually getting the Euro money supply cut was imminent.

I mean are you kidding me, you are aware of Tsochatzopoulos the guy that stole 100 million in submarine deals? Among the people he hired in some ""institute of external defensive policy analysis"" (that would be like 4000 euros a month), was a 23 year old woman trained as an elementary school teacher, that went and did a one year ""MSc in the political sciences"" in some god knows where college in Britain, and at age 23, a teacher, got hired as a high ranking consultant in millitary affairs. Guess of what party's political frontline she is now a part of?  Phd owners that are unemployed and search frantically for a 600 euro job at 32 years old, have to listen to that damn bitch and her syrizaiobullshit while a single metro station in athens has more employees than a fucking nuclear station most of them with no degrees a 1700 euro salary and complaining about the austerity.

true,Ginjeet,ANAR,☭,"&gt; there are communist parties all over Europe

True.

&gt; People always like and liked big honorable ideas which offer simple honorable solutions.

I really don't think you describe communism well. The core ideas of communism are democratic economics, egalitarianism, equality, statelessness and classlessness as final goals. If you'd care to read a bit into Marxist-Leninist theory you'd see that nothing that could qualify as 'simple' comes up, due to the fact that Russia's state of affairs were radically lagging behind the capitalist standard of the west.

After the fall of the soviet union other schools of communism came to being, obviously with the goal to find out what went wrong and how to do it better.

Even if you don't agree that the goals are 'honorable', you can not say that the ideas/theories are [simplistic or vague](http://www.marxists.org/archive/index.htm).

&gt;And history taught us that people do not learn from history. 

As already hinted most Marxists today agree that the soviet union was a catastrophe of the 20st century.

&gt;During the communist regime in Czechoslovakia there was about 10-15 % of people in the ""upper class"" living good and happy lives

This is pretty biased. There are downs and ups for every system. Most elderly people in Hungary agree that the standard of living, the quality of arts, entertainment, products (the list goes on) were much better. There is no question however, that the corrupt bureaucracy had better living conditions.

&gt;Also there were people who just did what they were told to do and had their security (cars, education...) [...]

This is 100% true even today.

&gt;[...] and they were simply too weak to function in a free market based society.

Must be language barriers, but this sounds pretty crazy. You might mean that it requires some additional strength (?) to function in a free market society, which to me sounds crazy, or that they couldn't properly function from malnutrition which would be true in any environment.

&gt; And so a big percentage of these people vote the communist party still and ofcourse a lot of their children do also.

So you basically think that the corrupt parents and their children make up the communists. Damn, that's some socio-critical skill you got there.

&gt; The reason why communists got such a big percentage of the votes is because their supporters always come to vote and are dutiful

The Actual percentage of overall GDP in financial services is much larger.

Granted, our current currencies are messed up, they serve the purposes of a few at the expense of the rest of us. Yet nothing what he says in this video contributes to anything. The tale about carrying the gold from one hole to another hole was funny though.

This reminds me of Charles de Gaulle. In 1971 Charles de Gaulle wanted to exchange his US dollar reserve into gold, something which had been promised by the US under the Bretton Woods conference. However, de Gaulle knew the US would be unable to do so since they had issued much more US dollars than they had gold in reserve. I guess de Gaulle was fed up being rolled by the americans.

What happened next however he did not expect, I guess. In 1971 Nixon disconnected the US dollar from the gold standard (this is called *the Nixon shock*). He said: US dollars can no longer be exchanged for gold. The immediate response was that OPEC countries hiked the price of oil since the dollars they received were perceived as worthless. These two elements led to the oil crisis and world-wide crisis of the 1970's.

In came Ronald Reagan in 1980. He further devaluated the US dollar in a - successful - attempt to improve US exports. He also removed financial regulation that was still in place as if there still was a gold standard. Behind the scenes in the 1980's the entire post-gold standard world was being destructured. Many privately held companies for example were dramatically under-valued. Savvy investors picked these out, bought them for scraps, sold the individual parts and made a racket.

In many occassions the value of these companies was so vast that it over shadowed their economic value. This is why so many people were laid off in the 1980's: because the companies they were working for were worth much more than the actual economic activity they were doing.

Another thing is that many countries (the ones with a lot of German influence) have a schooling-is-destiny worldview where e.g. at hiring a programmer it is important to have a university degree in programming and self-taught wizards are seen with suspicion, and this means people do not change careers much. So one important kind of starting over is out.

Having said that, a lot of migration happens, but that is purely economic, in search of better salaries and living conditions, generally from east and from south to north/west. I am one too. I live in Austria, but if I could make the same kind of salary, then after X years state pension etc. back home in Hungary, I would fuck off back in a moment.

European values in Romania?! What are you talking about?

2. Die Fahrschulen und Prüfer haben mit dieser Gesetzgebung erfolgreich für den demographisch bedingten Mangel an Fahranfängern vorgesorgt.

This is pretty biased. There are downs and ups for every system. Most elderly people in Hungary agree that the standard of living, the quality of arts, entertainment, products (the list goes on) were much better. There is no question however, that the corrupt bureaucracy had better living conditions.

- That's not biased, it's not an absolutely precise statistic, but it's gerally agreed upon. You would have to know more about our regime, because it was quite different from Hungary.

Must be language barriers, but this sounds pretty crazy. You might mean that it requires some additional strength (?) to function in a free market society, which to me sounds crazy, or that they couldn't properly function from malnutrition which would be true in any environment.

- I think it's clear what I meant. The people simply weren't prepared to face the competition and other free market differences.

So you basically think that the corrupt parents and their children make up the communists. Damn, that's some socio-critical skill you got there.

- I'm not saying 100 % were ""corrupt and evil"", stop pulling things out of your ass. There was lots of naive members of the communist party whose thought they might change something from the inside.


Well, at least you could say one good thing about them.

- Nazis were quite dutiful too.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Competition is surely best achieved when the cost of entry for new suppliers into the market is lower? Look at the dotcom sector, for example. Very little upfront capital was required for Sergey and Larry to start Google and outdo the big corporations like Yahoo and Lycos.

Yes. This is exactly the basis for my argument. :)

When the cost of entry is prohibitive (which is the case for a lot of things), or potential competitors get locked out of the market, competition cannot exist.

&gt;  As it turns out, regulation is the one thing large corporations love the most, because it increases the cost of entry into the market for start-ups, thereby eliminating competition.

This is clearly bullshit. Northern Europe is one of the most regulated places on Earth, yet also consistently ranked highly in how easy it is to run a business and start a company.

Source: [DoingBusiness.org: Economy Rankings](http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings)

You're using the word ""regulation"" as a catch-all for ""bureaucracy"", and they're certainly not the same, and they don't have to be.

&gt; This is achieved exactly because the IT sector is not a government-run department.

There's nobody here who says that the public sector shouldn't work with the private sector. It's only a good thing when they do, to the benefit of all. My central argument is that not all things are achieved equally well in both sectors — so of course you should just let each sector do what it's good at!

&gt; You need them to be much more than ""not corrupt"" to achieve the level of evolution you're currently seeing in other sectors of industry, mostly technology. If you think of government as a technology for achieving greater wellbeing for all, well, it hasn't evolved very much compared to other technologies over the last century.

And why is that? Because it's doing a pretty damn good job, actually, in most of the countries where it has grown to a big size (i.e. Scandinavia, the rest of Northern Europe). There's only so many ways you can pay for someone's healthcare. There's only so many ways you can organise millions of people into combatting poverty, hunger, foreign threats, large-scale infrastructure problems, etc. — government is one very efficient way of doing that, private companies are not.

Nah, in any economic context I think most people could quickly develop a sense of what's a sensible price based on average living costs in the area.

&gt; If I think he's charging too much, I won't contract him. If he thinks I'm offering too little, he won't cut my lawn. If we both voluntarily agree to a price for his service than who gets to decide whether or not he's ""charging beyond reasonable levels""?

Yeah the problem is, though, if your life depends on it (i.e. it's healthcare, or food, or housing, etc.) you won't actually be able to choose a different provider. And then there are the cases where there *is* no other provider.

The fact is, you *will* end up paying the salaries of investors as well as the actual people doing the work. That cost must necessarily be higher than the cost of just the work in itself. Thus, it's cheaper for the government to run this service, when no significant innovation or room for competition is possible.

&gt; Secondly, your definition of ""charging a premium"" is not consistent with any dictionary definition. Nowhere is it defined as ""beyond reasonable"". It's just a sum added to an ordinary charge.

Communism goes further than socialism. In communism there is almost no private property, everything belongs to the state and the people are the state. In practice, it has never existed. The so-called communist countries of Eastern Europe were really socialist. The reason the were called communist is that originally socialism was supposed to be only a stopgap, a transitional period between capitalism and the eventual communist utopia.

Really depends though on how gay you'd like it. If you're walking around those previously mentioned streets long enough someone will hit on you (specially at night, lot of gay clubs/bars etc.).

additional upside: Cologne has amazing weather its raining all around Cologne and inside the city you'll have pure sunshine (something to do with geographical location and whatnot). Just to point this out summers in Cologne are very hot, way above your avg. UK temps.

If your into that sorta thing, Cologne has a huge Pride, Inner city will be overflowing with gays (seriously its a week long party)

I still suspect think you are still confusing things. 

As I said, healthcare being provided by the private sector doesn't mean it isn't guaranteed. Here in Poland, I have public health insurance but when I go to a doctor I often don't even know who owns the place. Sometimes it's public, other times semi-public or private - whoever offered the best service and was awarded a contract from the NFZ, i.e. the national health insurance. I don't care who runs it, all that matters is I have insurance.

Same with education: schools being privately-run does not contradict public education. That's the system in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden. Do you know that in the Netherlands most children attend independent, private schools? That's because the funding doesn't go to schools themselves but follows each pupil directly. Parents receive a voucher and can send their child to whichever school they like, regardless if it's public or private. Most parents choose private institutions. What's wrong with people having this freedom of choice? How do you justify taking is away? Not only is there no reason for it, it is *immoral*.

I think it is amazing how the left wing tries to spin this issue. They've somehow managed to paint restricting people's choice to a government monopoly as good and caring, while allowing people to choose is portrayed dangerous and greedy. 

In countries that have dismantled the government monopoly on health and education services nobody, not even hard left, talks about going back. Once people saw that allowing private sector to compete doesn't mean the service isn't guaranteed, it became obvious that the left-wing rhetoric doesn't make any sense.

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","A lot of the big camps where they killed people and burned bodies were in rural areas in the east. The stink would have covered the whole area (Allied soldiers said in interviews that they immediately noticed the smell of burning bodies when they got there) so the argument ""we didn't know"" doesn't actually work there.

In the west or in big cities, it's a bit more complicated. For once, people were trying to save their own skin. You couldn't just tell the Nazis to stop that (see: all the resistance groups. If they were lucky, one or two members of such groups survived) or demand information. People got openly executed and neighbours got taken at night. If you've got a wife and two children, saving your family was more important to the people. 

Then, you've got to keep in mind that we look at it in retro-perspective. Today, if you hear the words ""war"" and ""camps"" in the same sentence, concentration camps pop into my mind. Back then, that was mostly unimaginable so people might have had ideas about where they took people but nobody knew for sure or wanted to believe that such a terrible thing was even possible. Since there wasn't hard evidence for the death camps and it was unimaginable cruelty, people just didn't want to believe.

Of course, it's obvious that something is terribly wrong if the SS is getting your neighbours at night. But if there are no hard evidence for it, your fear for the safety of your family and the rumours are unimaginable terrible, it's very easy to convince you that the rumours are only rumours.

So, ""we didn't know"" is true. ""We couldn't know"" is bollocks since there were dangerous ways to be sure.

This means that to achieve a majority any 2 of the larger blocks must ally, but nobody wants to even talk to Berlusconi, so the only option is PD + M5S. However Grillo said that they'll never fully support anyone else, only single laws if they agree. The constitution requires that in order to even start a government must pass a confidence vote.

So this is what happens:

 - PD: let's form a government with a common agenda.
 - M5S: NEVAR! We'll vote single laws.
 - PD: But we need to form a government to even talk about laws!
 - M5S: DIE YOU SCAMMING THIEVES WE'LL NEVER COMPROMISE!!1!1!!!

&gt; This is really offensive to the people who accept shitty jobs just to be able to survive a bit longer.

What is really offensive is for people on at least €40 per day to complain, while there are others surviving on €15 per day, doing equally hard jobs. Also, the state can only do so much. Technical and University education is free (although it shouldn't be for richer people, a modest contribution would help those that struggle).

true,gocarsno,POLA,Poland,"&gt; Public healthcare, like private healthcare, has rules about what you need to do in order to get reimbursed. Private healtcares to complement the public healthcare are common. What the right tried to do, is not to replace public healthcare with a voucher system, but to remove altogether public healthcare and let people choose their own private healthcare that they pay for monthly.

Thanks, this finally clears it up for me. OK, so instead of paying a monthly social insurance tax, you pick your own insurance and pay for it. This means healthcare indeed wouldn't be *public* any more. The question is, would it be *universal*? Was the insurance supposed to be compulsory? What would happen if you couldn't afford it?

&gt; With education, you usually either put your children to a public school or to a private school, but you still have the choice in France, and this is a good thing. However public school is free, private school is paid for.

That's what I mean. You pay for education in taxes but if you want to send your kid to a private school, you can't use that money and have to pay separately. That's not right.

&gt; The UMP tried to make public school less functional and less funded.

You make it sound as if they were going to just cripple the public schools and give nothing instead. What was their rationale? What were they going to do with the money it saved? Please explain it in a little more detail.

&gt; What are you talking about removing the freedom of choice when funding healthcare and public school? That doesn't make sense. 

You paid for education in taxes but it only covers public institutions. If you want to choose a private school, you have to pay double for it. That's not a fair choice for people and it's not a level ground for private enterprises to compete.

A true technocracy could be interesting but that brings with it a lot debate about what is the right approach. Not all experts agree.

One thing we could do with is less short-termism. A lot of policy doesn't and can't work on short time scales but most people are aghast if changes don't happen yesterday!

true,keepthepace,FRAN,France,"&gt;The question is, would it be universal? Was the insurance supposed to be compulsory? What would happen if you couldn't afford it?

It wouldn't be compulsory (right now you are free to not have any private health insurance) and it wouldn't cover non-paying consumers. So if you could not afford it, a simple operation, even life-saving, would put you under debts.

&gt; That's what I mean. You pay for education in taxes but if you want to send your kid to a private school, you can't use that money and have to pay separately. That's not right.

That's called a state and life in a society. I pay for the roads I don't use. I pay for the army I don't like. I pay for the enforcement of laws I don't like. I do think it is right, but the day when a majority believes like you do that it is not right, they will change the rules and I will abide by the new ones.

I do believe however, that on various aspects, even if you don't have children that need schooling, it is worth paying a bit more to live in a country where even the poorest people have basic education. It cuts costs on police, justice, prison, and dynamizes the economy.

&gt; You make it sound as if they were going to just cripple the public schools and give nothing instead. What was their rationale? What were they going to do with the money it saved? Please

There rationale was : There are too much public workers (I could agree on this statement). There solution was : let's just not replace half of the public workers who go into retirement. In every field, in every domain, with no discrimination. Really. That was how they implemented it : half the posts where people would go into retirement would not be replaced. This brought chaos into tribunals. They squeezed the public services by slow attrition.

I could also be cynical and point out that Sarkozy's brother leads one of the biggest private healtcare/welfare group in France, but that would be trash talking, of course...

They have a dogmatic distaste with the notion that any mission could be more efficiently handled as a public service than by a public sector.

&gt; You paid for education in taxes but it only covers public institutions. If you want to choose a private school, you have to pay double for it.

I want to live in a country where people know how to count, read, have a basic grasp of history and economy before they are allowed to vote. I am willing to pay for that, as is the majority of the population. I am willing to do so even though I don't have kids and would probably homeschool them if I had rather than putting them into the education system.

The point you make is one of the core debates in a democracy : what should be paid by the state (i.e. by everyone) and what should be a matter of personal choice. Your opinion is defensible, but you shouldn't present it as the only fair one. A reasonnable argument can also be made for the opposite opinion. Namely, that every child deserves an education, regardeless of their parents' financial situation. 

Public school is not just a service offered to parents, but also and foremost to children. And it is considered in most countries, including mine, like a human right to have basic education. Therefore, if you accept this notion (you are free to disagree, but then it is the majority who gets to decide) then a public service has to exist.

Or take the S-Bahn to ""Nufringen"" where you can bike through the ""Naturpark Schönbuch"".

Breweries in ""Franken"", the western part of bavaria, are amazing. I'd advice you to spend one day going to ""Nördlingen"" and ""Kloster Weltenburg"" near Kelheim. Nördlingen, because it's a beautiful medieval town that lies in the center of a meteor crash site (there is a tower, the ""Daniel"", from where you can see this very clearly). Weltenburg, because of beer, beer garden, monestary and brewery. Also you come across the ""Altmühltal"".

As for cars and besides the Mercedes Benz Museum and the Porsche Museum you can go for the plant tour in Mercedes' biggest plant worldwide in Sindelfingen, right next to Stuttgart: http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1037141-1-1488375-1-0-0-0-0-0-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; As this evolves, you will see states competing more and more for citizen-customers.

Sure. There's tons of people moving to the richer countries within the EU, partly because of a better job environment created by a better governmental service level in those richer countries.

&gt; How many sectors of industry do you know where up to 49% of the customers will allow being unhappy with the way the company is run for up to 5 years? How many customers would wait 5 years for, say, their cellphone supplier to get their act together?

This is a false analogy. The things that 49% of people in, say, Denmark are unhappy about will vary tremendously from person to person, and is usually the small scale stuff. The wiggle room for political parties to differentiate themselves from one another is very small in the big picture. When 49% of people ""disapprove"" of the government, it's usually about issues contained in about 1-5% of the actual services provided by the government.

&gt; I have no political stance on this. My goal is not to politicise, but to de-politicise subjects that are currently believed to lie within the premise of politics

Yeah I've heard this line of reasoning from libertarians before. The problem is, though, that politics don't just pertain to things that are democratic. Everything that happens in the public sphere is political (and most philosophers would say the private sphere too). When you move power from a democratically elected government into the hands of private companies, you essentially weaken democracy in favour of plutocracy, and that is a highly political act.

&gt; Geographical monopolies (i.e. state institutions in their current form) will not be able to exist for much longer, because we are transcending geography by the day.

I agree that the nation state is probably on the way out (in favour of supranational entities, like the EU), but geographical monopolies aren't, whether democratically elected or not — I just happen to prefer the democratic monopoly, that serves the people rather than shareholders.

&gt; Look at what is happening in France, for example. Personal income, capital gains and wealth taxes are raised and service quality is dropped. Result: hundreds of thousands of citizen-customers are rapidly looking for a supplier switch, be it in Belgium, Switzerland, UK or elsewhere. They see the state exactly with the same eyes they see a cellphone service supplier: Not happy with the service? Switch to another supplier.

Yeah. Eventually, though, all states converge on a similar service level, and will have similar problems, similar expenses, similar taxation levels. This is already the case for all of Northern Europe.

&gt; From this perspective, it's really very simple, and it's very clear to me that governments like Sweden - where the price per customer is exceedingly high - are going to have to do a lot more to keep their customers than run some silly adverts...

The thing is, you just don't see Swedes move in large numbers out of the country. They *like* their country, and they *like* the way their government runs, because there is a distinct feeling that it actually *does* something — one of the best school systems in the world, one of the best healthcare systems in the world, one of the most trustworthy governments, one of the most reliable job markets, one of the least corrupt societies — all that is well worth the price of high taxes, in the eyes of most Swedes (and Danes too, for that matter).",0,1362416857,null,0,false,0,c8pk5bu,t3_19jbuw,t1_c8pk5bu,t1_c8piuv6,null,1431479309,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

They didn't say ""our goal is to dismantle public healthcare"" (actually they did say things close to that off the record) they simply funded healthcare less, restricted the people who could have access to it, made it harder to get reimbursments, made the reimbursement lower, reduced the number of people working in this service.

In practice, they put a lot of incentive to get a private healthcare. 

&gt; However, parents should be able to send their kids to private schools with no extra charge.

Ok, I see what you mean. I wouldn't mind this system much but still oppose it for one simple reason : most private schools in France are religious and your proposal would allow the public financing of religious organizations, which is contrary to our constitution.

I would have personally no problem with the state offering vouchers to private and secular schools, but I see how this could offend people who would want their children to have a religious education and see the state like taxing only their religious belief.

There is a number of non-religious private schools that already receive subsidies from the government. I think that given our constitution this is more the way to go : parents who put their kids to private school still pay more, but a part of the cost is absorbed by the state.

It is normal that they pay more, as private schools here usually have better equipment and better paid teachers.",0,1362417078,null,0,false,0,c8pk7va,t3_19lmfp,t1_c8pk7va,t1_c8pjkuh,null,1431479359,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Most people know it as the 'Disney Castle', it made for a pretty cool day out (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle), also if you have access to a car and want to see some cutesy german architecture and towns then a roadtrip down the Romantische Strasse covers a lot (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_Road).

It's easy and cheap to get from Munich to Stuttgart, if you've any interest in cars then this is worth a visit, home to the Porsche museum, Mercedes Benz Museum (and the Lamborghini one although it's not so public). 

It's super easy to fly around other places in Europe very cheap (train and coaches also heavily available from Munich). So Paris definitely worth a visit and London if you had a little longer weekend maybe. Strasbourg on the border with France &amp; Germany is a super cute town (lot's of EU institutions to visit too if you're interested) and do able by train.

Don't know where abouts near Munich you are but when I was around Augsburg for a while I discovered that Ryanair fly out of a really little airport called Memmingen, I could pretty much reach most main European cities from here in under 2 hours with return flights for under 100 euros! (I once did a Friday to Sunday London - Memmingen return trip for 65 euros flights).

Another little tip for making friends and maybe finding expats is looking for ""Au Pairs in Munich/name of smaller town you're in"" groups on facebook, I found pretty much every town I lived in Europe had one of these groups, even towns that were too small to have colleges or much international student scene had these Au Pair groups and it was the easiest way to meet other girls of every nationality, who where in the same position of not knowing anyone and wanting to travel at the weekends, not all of them where Au Pairs - some just joined the groups to meet other girls in similar scenarios or to try and get a little extra work tutoring (also worth considering English tutoring on the side for good extra money maybe?).

Sadly you'll be leaving too early to catch the Oktoberfest but if you want a fun souvenir investing in a nice Dirndl can be quite an experience and some of the smaller towns (I got mine from Augsburg) have streets full of shops selling all the traditional german dresses and Lederhosen! They are amazing quality and can be extremely beautiful, much nicer than the very cheap nasty costume ones people tend to wear for fancy dress in other countries! I think mine is my favourite thing I picked up while in Germany.

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","Here's another objection to the article's argumentation: the single-minded focus on ""stimulus spending"" and ""monetary policy"" always baffles me, and this article makes no exception. 

In the later section the author talks about how the Eurozone development (during and, now perhaps, after the crisis) is worse than that of the US, and that this is a ""home made"" problem. He then continues to imply that a more aggressive monetary policy and more stimulus are the reason (he talks about ""Asymmetric policy responses"", which probably means US stimulus vs. EU austerity programs).

The problem however is that he ignores one important, perhaps *the* most important factor: unemployment. Greece for example currently hovers around 30% unemployment, Spain is not much better. France, a huge economic factor in the Eurozone, is at around 10%. Obviously our GDP hasn't picked up because in some of our economies there's a almost a third of the workforce not contributing to it (against their will, I'm sure they'd want a job more than anything else).

So in the end it comes down to a completely different question: how to reduce the (possibly systemic) unemployment problem of parts of Europe. And if your idea of an answer is ""throw more stimulus on it"" then I'm afraid you haven't paid attention to the realities of the past decades. 

Disclaimer: I'm not saying stimulus is never a good idea. Perhaps now would be a good time to actually increase state spending to a degree, in a controlled fashion. But what I *do* say is that the real answer to the unemployment problem is increasing competitiveness of some of the EU economies, and carpet bombing style stimulus spending is not going to achieve that.

tl;dr The real problem behind GDP development is the high unemployment in the Eurozone. And the way to fight that is improving productivity/innovation capacity/etc in the Eurozone.",0,1362421866,null,0,false,0,c8pls0n,t3_19il0q,t1_c8pls0n,t1_c8of8x6,null,1431480040,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

“A leaving Pope Benedict called it the blackest page of his tenure, the abuse of children in the Roman Catholic Church. But, there is one country where the abuse is completely denied, which is in Poland, a Catholic nation where people don’t want to believe that the religious rape children, talking about it is taboo. Victims who do talk, are castigated by their neighbourhood. The roles are still reversed; the abusers enjoy the safety of the church and the victims must keep silent, which they almost all do. “

“You were abused? Is it a problem if a priest strokes a child’s head?” “I have my own children!” “You acolytes… you wanted to blackmail the priest!”

“Vincent Sziemansky (SP?) was abused in his hometown Zakroczym; the priest had abused multiple children, though nobody believed it. It was quite the opposite…” “The official version (of the people) was that we, the acolytes of Zakroczym, noticed the weakness of the priest and abused it. Thus, it looked as if we, boys aged 12, 13, 15 had raped the priest! It was horrible, I had to flee. Fleeing, fleeing, do you know what that means? To where? Under communist rule. There was nowhere to go!”

“In the end, Sziemansky accomplishes fleeing Poland, he moves in Canada and is currently the owner of a website offering help to Polish victims of sexual abuse by priests. Using his data, Sziemansky estimates that at least 15.000 people have been abused using his data. The church wants to know about nothing.”

“We speak with a few cases. Do not forget that it is always a moral question. You do not make these known to the public. The only thing I can say is that a few cases are currently known. I think that the deeply rooted faith of the Polish is an important element. Despite the amazement of the West that only so very few cases are known here, it is the truth nevertheless. Because faith is much stronger here than in countries as the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.”

“In oh-so Catholic Poland priest are highly esteemed, people simply don’t want to believe that they abuse children. Not even in the rare case that a priest is convicted for sexual abuse such as here in Tilama (SP?) in the south-east of Poland.”

“It’s impossible that it’s true. He was so good to the children. The children loved him. If he really had done something, they wouldn’t have loved him. Or not? He was innocent.”

“He truly was a good priest. He wasn’t materialistic at all. That they accused him of sexual abuse is not believable.”

“Tilama’s priest als rapes Ewa Orlowska (SP?). Eva is one of the few who dares to testify against the priest to the fury of her fellow villagers.”

“The priest has been convicted, end of story!” “Is that all you have to say?” “Yes!” “Thank you.” “You’re looking for money, you won’t get it. You don’t have a case.” “You want money yourself.”

“Eva learns during the lawsuit that priest also abuses her daughters.”

“He could do whatever he wanted. Parents and teachers allowed it. If a child suffered from a headache, a priest would visit. Because he had healing powers.  He healed them by putting a hand under their clothes during Sunday school* with everybody else present. Ten years later, it seems that the priest is now seen as the victim. And we can, sorry to put it in these words, go fuck ourselves. In the end the Church always wins.”

“You can keep silent for a long time, ban the images to the bottom of your memory and wonder who was guilty, you can ask God…” “The Polish artist Kora was abused by a priest.” “Of course there are many people who hate me because I made it public. How can you do that? They’ll immediately tell you that the priest is only human too who can make errors. Okay, but every error must have consequences. Nothing is worse than doing that to a child.”

“Also Wojtek Petrewic is a victim of sexual abuse, years later he looks for the priest who raped him and finds out where he works.” “I still want to hear: ‘I’m sorry.’ I want to see his reaction  when we see each other again. Jesus, they’re still sleeping. ” “Hello?” “Is the priest here?” “He’s not there.” “It’s something personal, where is he?” “He’ll be back after the holidays.” “I’ve been looking for this priest, and finally found him in this parish. I know he’s a priest here; they keep him hidden from me, they have even sent him to Germany for a month. But I know he has returned now. As long as I have the strength and as long as I live, I will keep looking for him. Until we meet again, eye-to-eye.”

true,spammster,GERM,Germany,"German here, for smaller bills like a single coffee etc. (so basically everything below 5€) I'll just round it up. if its 3,80 I'll give 4 € cause screw 20 cent. I don't think anyone considers this condescending. 

Cabs i usually go with the same deal just round up and add a Euro. I however will add quite a bit more if the cab driver does not talk to me. For some reason whenever I'm super tired and just wanna go home the cab driver gets the idea I'm totally in it for an hour long debate and doesn't get the hint that i want him to STFU.

Restaurants I will always round up to a nice amount (I don't consider this to be a tip its 99 cents at the most). The way i see a tip is something that should be worked for. you gotta earn a tip. you are already getting paid to bring me my food. So if that is all you do (show up, take order, then slap the plates on the tables and walk off to never be seen again) it will be a rounding game.

If the waiter is however actually nice and attentive (I don't expect miracles here just be generally nice a smile is always appreciated and if its a longer lasting meal showing up asking if anyone would like a refill etc. i consider to be good service).

if its an upscale restaurant I do expect better service. I expect the waiter to know whats on the menu (these restaurants have waiters that actually have been trained for 2 years turns out you can actually learn to become a waiter for the uppity crowd) make a decent recommendation when it comes to drinks. I don't expect the waiter to memorize the wine cart etc. but if i ask what wine he/she would recommend I do expect an answer just pick 2-3 wines from the 3 big ones (red,white,rose) and recommend one. and obviously the drinks should be served correctly same for utensils. 

I really don't think thats asking too much. If you're nice and good at your job you'll get a tip depending on what I feel like its usually gonna be somewhere around 10%.

The most I'm tipping is probably delivery guys since those usually get a shitty deal (more often then not the delivery guys will show up in their own cars and not a company one etc.). I just feel like they deserve more of a tip (percentage wise, tip is gonna be around a couple €).

But I have absolutely no problem at all not giving a tip and if the waiter manages to actually piss me off by being rude etc. I will not give a single cent I'll wait for them to give me my last 20 cent back (thats where they start to dig around in the wallet forever pretending to find a coin).

I really only tip differently in the US due to the previously mentioned points of shitty pay.

“John Paul II was convinced that you should handle these things discreetly. Now we know that this stance has led to crimes committed by priests. They committed them without punishment. You could accuse them and they could not be deposed because those cases took years. The perpetrator was protected, instead of the victim.”

“Vincent Sziemansky has returned to his hometown, Zakroczym. He tries to start a conversation with former fellow villagers about the priest who abused him.” “So tell me, the priest?” “Yes, I remember him. He was like this and that.” “Listen, have you ever heard the priest was a pedophile?” “He loved boys, huh?” “Yes, yes.”

“You were abused? Is it a problem if a priest strokes a child’s head?” “I have my own children!” “You acolytes… you wanted to blackmail the priest!” “We?” “The entire village supports me. You’re selling nonsense!” “So something *was* happening.” “You were a deceiver and you were scumbags!” “So we blackmailed the priest? Why?” “Because you were young and stupid!” “What the? Me, blackmailing a priest?” “Stop, the people agree with me.” “That single priest?” “You’re selling nonsense! Everyone thinks you’re an idiot, the stuff you write on the internet. Normal people say you’re a pervert.” “Yes?” “Yes, what do you even want? What do you even want?” “To tell the truth.” “How old are you?” “I’m 58 years old.” “That’s 58 years *too* old, then.”

No, you stated this:

&gt;When you have a small group of people who have an amount of money that is enough to strongly influence a country/government then they are the ones listened to, not the people.

Switzerland doesn't have a problem with graft but it needs to prevent people from getting rich and potentially engaging in graft? 

&gt;It is limiting the money they are giving themselves simply because they can.

You seem to be entirely ignorant of how corporations work. Not surprising, really, since any actual knowledge might interfere with your blind hatred and jealousy. Executives don't ""give themselves"" a cent. Executive pay is determined by the owners of the company.

&gt;Those in power giving themselves more money upon leaving a company or joining one? 

How would an executive, an employee of the board of directors, give himself more money when he left? He never had the power to affect his pay in the first place.

&gt;But you can pretend I am seething with jealousy when I quote someone else if you wish...

Then the person you quoted was seething with jealousy.

&gt;You act as though there is an infinite pool of money.

Wrong. There's an ever-expanding pool of wealth. Money isn't spent once and then destroyed.

&gt;If a small group of people control a large amount of money then that money isn't in the hand of the majority

And how is it your business if a group of owners decides to take their money and give it to a person? 

&gt;This gives this small amount of people more power as their money grows which is counter to the ideas of democracy

How? You maintain that Switzerland doesn't have a problem with graft.

&gt;It is limiting the amount a small group of people can reward themselves without positive outcomes from their actions. It isn't punishing them

This is a punishment. You're poking the government's head into what should be a private affair and overriding the freely-made decisions of citizens. And again, you seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of how corporations work.

&gt;The reason for this was the bonuses given to CEO's even when the companies were not performing well while others were being laid off.

Unless you're a shareholder, this is none of your business.

&gt;That is the issue they are trying to solve. Rich people punishing others to keep their wallet full. Don't lie to yourself and pretend people are simply ""seething with jealousy"".

The ""issue"" still seems to be that people are seething with jealousy and want to arbitrarily punish those that have more than them.

Just don't expect a negative attitude, because then you'll find it. And don't get irritated by lots of really stupid questions about your background. Usually people mean no harm by being nosy. And if in doubt simply say you are Australian. Australians are cool for everyone.

Wuppertal is rainy. That's due to the montains. The winters are warm and the summers cold. 

Wuppertal is ugly. It has a few nice spots, but it is ugly. It is however quite nice outside of the city and it has several major train stations, you can leave quickly. :P (I think you have to buy a train and bus ticket for ~180€ per semester, at least German students have to.)


&gt;Quality of education in Uni Wuppertal

That depends. That friend of mine studies psychology and the reputation is... well... not that good. But that varies from program to program. Even at germanys  top unis (like KIT, RWTH, Heidelberg) there a programs below average or worse. And mediocre or even bad unis have programs with great reputations. Well, it depends. For CSiS I don't know. Couldn't find any raking ad hock. I guess the differences in the english speaking world between unis are bigger than in germany. 

That sounds horrible, but no. I actually don't know very much about Wuppertal.

true,NuclearWookie,null,null,"&gt;I already stated that concentration of wealth leads to a concentration of power.

This only matters if the concentration of wealth can be used to buy influence, something you maintain isn't a problem.

&gt;Did I ever say the executives are giving themselves the bonuses, like writing their own checks?

You said that they were ""giving themselves"" money, something that is structurally impossible. You insinuated this on multiple occasions. Read your comment history.

&gt;I used loose words purposely

This is a euphemism for lying. Or for simply being ignorant.

&gt;Those at the top of the company are giving themselves (the people at the top giving the people at the top) bonuses even when the companies are not doing well.

Your ignorance is showing again. The executives don't give themselves bonuses. Their bosses are on the board of directors, people that own the company. The bonus money in question comes from their pockets and from the other shareholders.

&gt;So let us put this in a different way so it is easier to understand. If a small group of people have a large percentage of the money in the country, it is destabilizing.

I like how you're condescending here yet still can't communicate your notions in terms beyond baseless assertions. How is this destabilizing if the political system of Switzerland is immune to graft?

&gt;Because it causes social issues down the line for other people in the country!

What ""social issues""? You maintain that money can't buy political power in Switzerland.

&gt;We don't all live in a little bubble that isn't affected by anything from another person's bubble. It is called a society in English.

In English, the term ""society"" doesn't cover arrangements made between private parties.

&gt;sigh But if you continue to have a large amount (percentage) of money with a small group of people the issue would quickly change!

Bullshit. That situation already exists in Switzerland. 

&gt;The centralization of money (power) is anti-democratic, period. You cannot have excessive money (power) in the hands of the few if you wish to have a democracy.

It's not anti-democratic unless it can be used to subvert democracy.

&gt;Rich men helping rich men get richer does not help the country or the people.

Nor does it harm the country or the people.

&gt;That is none of my business?! What about the people feeling it directly by being fired?

You have yet to prove a causal connection between executive bonuses and people being fired.

&gt;A society and how it functions is the business of all the society, not just those making the decisions.

And here you're being purely ideological. 

&gt;Social stability and a strong tradition of egalitarianism in Switzerland have NOTHING to do with it, right?

Since when has Switzerland had a tradition of economic egalitarianism? They're world-famous for not having such a tradition?

&gt;Not liking when those with power help themselves at the expense of others is communism?

No, appealing to the jealousy of the masses, using rich people as a scapegoat, and punishing them is.

&gt;Oh, you're Texan... then this ""logic"" makes sense.

I've directly quoted you. Don't get mad if you your argument doesn't hold water.

&gt;I never said Switzerland was immune to graft

You said: 

&gt;I didn't know that Switzerland had a huge issue with political graft.

in response to my criticism of your argument that this is necessary to prevent graft.

&gt;just that it isn't a problem RIGHT NOW.

Nowhere in that post did you state that it was a problem you anticipate they'd have in the future. Furthermore, the idea of hobbling everyone because someone **might** do something improper is absurd.

&gt;Like the United States.

How? Citizens United was in place for the last election and the Democrats still won. The main problem with the US implementation of democracy isn't graft, it's a shitty election structure that guarantees we get locked into a two party system.

&gt;People, when given the opportunity, grab power.

Then make laws which prevent them from grabbing power. Create a system where the incomes of politicians are publicly available and campaign financing is transparent. You're advocating the creation of laws that prevent people from having the means to grab power. Executive pay is a separate issue and you're simply using the specter of graft as an excuse to arbitrarily punish people that inspire jealousy in you.

&gt;It WILL lead to a destabilization of a democracy and is therefore anti-democratic.

No, it **could** be a **contributing factor** to the destabilization of democracy. But the same argument could be used for any issue.

&gt;Yes, because the communist reference was the epitome of maturity and understanding.

Quanto alla proposta di rendere bilingue /r/italypolitics, devo dire che a mio parere non sarebbe una buona idea. E questo per più di una buona ragione. 
La prima è che inevitabilmente l'italiano prenderebbe il soppravvento, e questo confonderebbe le idee   ai lettori anglofoni (e li allontanerebbe). Mentre la ragione principale per cui mi è venuto in mente di creare /r/italypolitics (sull'esempio di /r/ukpolitics o /r/uspolitics) è l'opportunità di offrire a lettori anglofoni un'informazione quanto più ampia possibile sulla politica italiana (per non parlare del fatto che, egoisticamente parlando, la cosa aiuta anche me a tenere sott'occhio quello che siscrive nel mondo anglosassone sull'Italia). 
Un'altra buona ragione è che ritengo molto probabile che il bilinguismo porterebbe come conseguenza il dilagare di una pratica che imperversa in tanti *subreddits* (ovviamente quelli politici): il *downvoting* nei confronti  di articoli in cui si sostengono idee -- o semplicemente se ne dà notizia ...--  che non collimano con quelle del *downvoter*: una pratica che giudico francamente ripugnante, quasi quanto un altro malcostume: quello di censurare (da parte dei ""moderatori"") i post altrui: quante volte sono stato testimone di porcherie simili su altri *subreddits* politici (anche molto, molto seguiti e ricchi di dibattito)? 
Insomma, non voglio veder sparire dall'elenco un post perché una *clacque* di tifosi sfegatati non gradisce. Se uno ha qualcosa da obiettare, lo metta per iscritto e faccia la fatica di argomentare, senza pugnalare alle spalle chi non la pensa allo stesso modo.

Comunque, aggiungo che personalmente sottoscriverei immediatamente un nuovo *subreddit* ""politico"" in italiano, in modo che chi è interessato non debba sorbirsi una marea di argomenti, diciamo così, più ""leggeri"", quando non del tutto frivoli (come capita a me quando, di tanto in tanto, vado su /r/europe).

You've said a number of conflicting things from the start.

&gt;Capping large bonuses is hobbling everyone?

This should be obvious. When you limit what everyone can do you're hobbling them.

&gt;While there is an issue with the Congressional system that pushes for a two party system, money within politics within the United States has been around way before Citizens United.

I'm largely in agreement with you, but this has nothing to do with executive pay.

&gt;I am not advocating the creation of laws that prevent people from having the means to grab power.

Yes, you are. You've argued that the an executive receiving an amount of pay you've arbitrarily deemed improper will somehow prevent the purchase of influence. And, now that I think about it, this is even more absurd since the truly wealthy *don't work** and don't receive salaries that would be affected by such laws.

&gt;No, I judged your opinions on what you have said. I saw Texas much later and it all fell into place.

What ""all fell into place""? A set of childish prejudices?

&gt;So you are saying that money, when held by the few, does not disrupt the democratic process?

No, not if the democratic process is robust, transparent, and impartial.

But anyone **could** if his path in life makes him that successful. You're putting a ceiling on everyone's earning potential. 

&gt;The shareholders are the ones that can now veto bonuses given to executives in Switzerland.

They could already do that through corporate elections and shareholder influence. This law prevents the shareholders from voluntarily paying their employees an amount they deem appropriate. 

&gt;These are not salaries. They are bonuses.

The distinction between the two is meaningless in this context. Income is income, and for executives bonuses are stipulated in their employment contracts.

&gt;While this law isn't perfect, it doesn't mean it isn't good. No one is arguing that this will prevent something, just that this can help.

Having a remotely valid justification is important before you deprive people of their rights. If you're admitting that this will do little or nothing to solve the problem you claim exists, how can you claim this is anything other an opportunistic punishment of rich people?

&gt;How long can the democratic process remain transparent and impartial if it isn't to the benefit of those with a large percentage of the wealth/power?

If wealth can't buy influence, forever. The people you should be scrutinizing are the politicians, not those who may potentially bribe them.

&gt;Switzerland doesn't have a culture of the ""truly wealthy""

Yes it does. They're just not as flamboyant as those in the US. European rich people aren't stupid. They know what happened the last time the jealousy of the masses was stirred up.

&gt;The law is to curb what the Swiss see as excessive payouts to the few while the rest get less and less.

Then the law is misguided since it doesn't target the people who are actually rich. If they limit executive pay the money won't go toward keeping redundant positions, it will go back to the shareholders.

&gt;As I said, they have had a long history of egalitarianism.

And they're being egalitarian by singling out a small group of individuals and violating their rights? Please.

&gt;They are well within their rights to do that as a society.

I don't argue this. I'm not Swiss so I have no reason telling them how to run their country. However, this is a violation of fundamental rights and a strong motive for companies to move elsewhere.

Cut to the interest rates Greece is paying on loans from its international partners: a) lower by 100 basis points the interest rate Greece is paying on its Greek Loan Facility–the loans it received on its first bailout package – from 2.5% to 0.75% . b) cutting interest rates even further once the country reached a primary surplus, currently projected to happen in 2014. This will help Greece to pay 600 million EUR less per year, 5 billion EUR in 8 years.](http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2012/11/27/eurogroup-3-bailout-tranches-in-4-tranches-a-drop-in-the-ocean-of-e319-bn-debt/)

Those are truly criminal interest rates!

That it is generalizing a whole nation and simplifying every existing cultural aspect. Culture, which is the base of those ""rules"" is not one solid block of understandings, it is altering between cities, regions, classes and - most importantly - between the different kinds of relationships you have with your counterpart. In Istanbul i was shaking every girls hand, including the ones of my prof and of my flatmates and it was no problem at all. In fact: If i would not have done it it would have given them a awkward moment, a sign that i am not understanding the basic rules of politeness. How did i know that i have to shake their hands? Well, if you want a simple rule: Do as everyone is doing. If everyone is shaking hands than you better do the same.

But of course, when i was visiting the very conservative family of my flatmate in the rural parts of Turkey i did not shake her sisters hand in front of her parents. I did not touch her in any way. How did i know here how to behave? Simple: By asking /(And by having the common sense that you behave differently in conservative areas). I was just asking my flatmate before seeing her family. Come on, no one expects a foreigner to know every rule everywhere. And sometimes where i did a mistake everyone was just ""correcting"" me with a laughter. They knew i was not familiar with the rules. They are not that stupid - and i am pretty sure neither your business partners are (In fact: Discussing my ""mistakes"" and the differences in between our cultures was the most fun part of the hole trip).

So if you are on your very important business trip: Inform yourself on how to behave in *exactly the situation you will have to face*. There is no need of any general rule because there is nothing as a general culture. Everybody is behaving according to their social background and the situation of their counterpart. 

Learning those tables and acting according to them will embarrass you more then the simple question: ""Do i now have to shake her hand?"" (see the ""Prof/Doktor - PhD problem which is listed on the table). If you really don't know how to spot the situation, how all the other people around you are acting and how to be just polite, i have a clue: Don't travel. 

e/ I've been in france and america and no one gave a damn about how i was shaking their hands, btw. If your business partner are judging those little things and not your actual business, well, then it's not really a good sign to work with them.

So it's no wonder you were having difficulties.

Also I have to admit I got the story a little bit wrong myself. It concerned modern apprenticeships and the 2010/2011 budget negotiations - they asked for more, more was delivered - they still voted against the budget.

From [Meeting of the Parliament 9 February 2011](http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx?r=7133&amp;mode=html) after 16:48

&gt;John Swinney
&gt;
&gt;Apparently, all that I have just announced is not enough for the Labour Party. That is a really interesting proposition. This is what I offered the Labour Party. I offered Labour a proposition that reflected all—and more—of the issues that were raised with me. I offered 6,500 additional modern apprenticeships—we are getting 25,000 now; a future jobs fund with 3,000 places, which Labour turned its back on; 2,000 flexible training opportunities that are being delivered; additional bursaries in the further education sector that are being delivered; additional funding for urban regeneration companies that is being delivered, Mr McNeil; and additional funding of £2 million for the freight facilities grant. That was all offered to the Labour Party, yet, somehow, it is not enough. That represents all and more of what Labour asked of me.

Another example was in Westminster when Labour failed to support a SNP/Plaid Cymru motion against the 50p tax-rate cut. This would have passed by unnoticed (the motion would have been defeated anyway) had it not been for a tweet from Willie Bain (Labour, Glasgow North East ) who confirmed what everyone had suspected for some time - that it is policy for Labour to not support any SNP proposal whatever its merits - now know as [The Bain Principle](http://wingsland.podgamer.com/the-bain-principle/).

This extended to Scottish Labour MP's voting against a SNP motion that stated that an independent Scotland would enjoy the same ""special relationship"" with rUK that is currently enjoyed by such countries as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India. The motion was defeated by 321 votes to 5. 32 Scottish MP's voted against it; 27 Labour, 4 Liberal Democrats and the one sole Conservative MP in Scotland. [Link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20544743). One can only wonder what they hope the future relationship will be.

Free is a quite shitty ISP nowadays. Their peering policy and lack of focus to service quality has driven their pipes to full blown congestion. Orange also have some issues with certain tier-1 (Cogent, Verizon) and content providers (Google mostly), but their user base is less bandwidth-hungry than most of free's customer.

SFR has some interesting offers too, and are the second more active ISP in term of fiber service.

Bouygues Telecom has a relatively poor infrastructure on either DSL, cable or fiber but has an excellent peering policy and very low congestion issues.

Numericable used to have an open peering policy too but their cable modems are underperforming and you may have localized issues depending on your neighbor's usage of their internet connectivity (cable is a shared wire amongst dozens of subscribers, where DSL is a private conduit and fiber has caps to limit the shared-media effect).

Alternative ISPsmay worth a shot if you don't need IPTV or a fixed phone line.

OVH does provide phone service (2 lines actually) for 30€/mo. In some cities they also offer SDSL service, ich is a symetrical bandwidth link of up to 5Mbps. Their customer service is relatively bad but their network is excellent. It's designed mostly for hosting, so they have a lot of spare bandwidth for access.

Nerim has the best customer service (you can actually talk to their chief technical officer if asked nicely, he even hangs on a few IRC channels), but it's 30€/mo for simple play internet service over ADSL. They have a very decent network designed for professional users.

In some cities you may also be interested in associative DIY ISPs. In Toulouse we have Tetaneutral.net , 260 members and counting, and we operate our own ISP with fiber, radio and DSL links. Starts as low as 15€/mo for students on the radio network over Toulouse and nerby cities. My radio link syncs at 100Mbps symetrical. Associative ISPs are generally memebers of the Federation French Data Network, funding La Quadrature Du Net and WikiLeaks, and strongly advocating for Net Neutrality.

Small precision :

* ISPs with native IPv6 support : Nerim, OVH, FDN (an other members of ffdn.org)

* ISPs with tunneled IPv6 suport : Free, SFR (on ADSL only)

* ISPs with no usable IPv6 service : Orange, Bouygues, Numericable


TL;DR : for best customer service with internet only access : [Nerim](http://www.nerim.fr/adsl) or an associative ISP from [FFDN](http://www.ffdn.org/wiki/doku.php?id=essaimage). For triple play service I'd rather go with SFR than Free or Orange.

For a longer weekend, Berlin, Venice, and Krakow are all great choices. Berlin is one of my favorite cities - there's so much to see. The same goes for Venice, although you may want to stay on the mainland as I can imagine a hotel in the city proper would be expensive (I can't tell you, as I stayed in a rectory when I was there).

Krakow is also extremely interesting. The city centre is filled with lots of interesting stores and museums. One of my favourites is the [Krakow Underground Museum](http://mhk.pl/oddzialy/podziemia_rynku). Wawel Castle also has enough exhibits to keep you there for a full day. The city is also near the mountains, so there's hiking if you want. Ojcow National Park is north of the city and an incredible sight to behold. A little farther away to the south is [Szyndzielnia](http://www.kolej-szyndzielnia.pl/), a mountain which you can ride up to an assortment of trails. I've had lots of fun there with family.

The cheapest shop beer is about €1.30 per 375ml can (with a 10c refund in two states) in a 24-pack, for barely-drinkable 4.5% ""lager"". 

Wine isn't too expensive here though (relative to beer, at least) - a 750ml bottle of plonk or cleanskin (unlabelled wine, can be anything) starts at a little under €4, a decent wine €8, and a good wine costs as much as you'd like to spend but gets silly after around €15-20.

* Generally where do you live? (North, South? East, West? City?) Bavaria/West, City and country, depending on the time of the year and week.
* What kinds of things are socially acceptable in Germany that may not be in another culture? I'd refine that question to a specific culture as it  sounds vague now. We say no more direct than in Japan, I have heard. Being open about being LGBT is common, for example, I suppose more so than in Iran. Drinking beer at work. Whole companies taking a two-week summer holiday.

* What kinds of things are socially unacceptable in Germany that may be in another culture? Being late or unpunctual, sloppy work maybe.
* In your culture, is there a basis for determining good and evil? If so, who or what is it? Traditional values inspired by the church's moral codex and the Aufklärung.
* How is hospitality displayed in Germany? We're not that open as Americans, but we display hospitality by inviting people to a game night, to dinner, or to the beer garden as a social event. We serve guests coffee or a cold beverage, take their jackets and offer a seat. Guests might bring a bottle of wine to a party.
* What are the different venues of life (work, school, social occasions, etc.) and how do those look? Middle class job, Duale Ausbildung or university, a lot of people are members of clubs called ""Vereine"".
* How would you describe the mind-set of a typical German? What are his or her goals and ideals? Get a good job (Beruf), marry, get a house, car and kids, become middle class and have a regular vacation in the summer.
* How do people deal with conflict? Discussing it?
* What do people do for fun? Sports, a hobby, Vereine, meeting friends, reading...
* What do most people think of God or any higher being? Varied. There are serious (and less serious) catholics, Lutherans and atheists all making up a sizeable portion of the populace. Islamic Immigrants are a respected minority. In general, Bavaria has more traditional religious people, the south of germany more than the east.
* What do you think of authority? Not to be trusted, ""Beamte"" are generally seen as followers of rules to minute detail.
* If you were to say that you really respect someone in your culture, what reasons would you give for respecting that person? Same as anyone else. Their achievements.",0,1362471820,null,0,false,0,c8q1juu,t3_19p0pa,t1_c8q1juu,t3_19p0pa,null,1431487732,3,false,de,t5_22i0,3

Kiel is ugly and you get pretty much only Kiel. Sure, bigger nightlife than Lübeck, but:

Lübeck is a really beautiful city. We have a bit of nightlife here. Hamburg is pretty much right around the corner (50 minutes by train), 300-350€ gets you an apartment outside of the altstadt or a WG inside.  
Additionally we have a pretty big international student community (mostly PHD students, some postdocs, some Bachelors/Masters students) with several events organized over Facebook (lately 1 day trips to places in and around Germany, lasertag, international stammtisch, a language exchange to learn from native speakers and much more). So I'd say go for Lübeck :)

To the others Lübeckers in here: There seem to be quite a few, why did we never manage a Reddit meetup here?

I mean illogical both because the worst has already happened most likely as soon as Bulgaria and Romania joined, as most people who'd want to go and steal in Germany have probably been in Germany for a while and the restrictions on work don't really stop them, and because the media has exaggerated the threat of this happening. Maybe I am wrong and people from these two countries do flood into Germany when work restrictions are lifted, having a border where the checks are minimal and where only an ID card is required will not stop them.  Why do I think that this is the true reason for Germany saying no? Because Hans-Peter Friedrich has made other statements, in this interview and on other occasions, that seem to cater to this electorate, including:
&gt;The right to freedom of movement means that every citizen of the EU can remain in any member state when he or she studies or works there.

- Il gap tra ricchi e poveri si sta allargando sempre di piu' (in US e' altissimo). La distribuzione del denaro dovrebbe essere piu' equa.

- Non vedo perche' un manager, per quando bravo, dovrebbe guadagnare come 200 operai, fa scelte importanti e tutto, ma lavora 8 ore al giorno come un operaio, ed e' l'operaio che monta l'automobile alla fine. Il dirigente non sa operare le macchine.

- Non e' detto, in generale, che i manager ""meritano"" la posizione e lo stipendio, la storia del self made man e' bella ma nella stragrande maggioranza di casi si tratta di eredita', investimenti spregiudicati, o semplice botta di culo. E' un discorso un po' articolato, bisognerebbe parlare di meritocrazia, ereditarieta', uguaglianza etc.

- Con le multinazionali e le societa' enormi che ci sono oggi, i manager piu' ricchi acquistano troppo potere, e diventano in grado di interferire con una democrazia a suo detrimento (vedi berlusca, vedi in US i politici che sono tutti straricchi)

- Piu' un manager e' ricco, piu' puo' essere spregiudicato con la sua azienda. Ci sono notissimi esempi di manager che combinano cazzate a proprio tornaconto mettendo a rischio l'azienda (vedi banche, sia in italia che in US, o mille altri esempi)

- Bisogna far girare l'economia. Se l'operaio non ha soldi da spendere, non compra. A volte mi fanno ridere i TG: ""Allarme, consumi in calo del 10%, preoccupate le multinazionali"", ma come allarme? avete decurtato gli stipendi, alzato i prezzi, messo nuove tasse, etc, e vi stupite se la gente non compra?? L'economia globale e' un sistema chiuso.

- I soldi extra guadagnati dall'azienda potrebbero essere reinvestiti nella stessa azienda, ampliandola o migliorando le condizioni di lavoro.

Ecco questo e' quanto. Non vorrei passare per il comunista che dice ""i manager prendano quando gli operai"", questo no, sarebbe deleterio, pero' assolutamente andrebbero regolati.

All this will do is stifle real debate about socialism in socviety, alternatives to capitalism and I would guess radicalize certain people and groups.

true,primedape,flag-de,Ingolstadt,"&gt;Generally where do you live? (North, South? East, West? City?)

South East, Bavaria, Ingolstadt

&gt;What kinds of things are socially acceptable in Germany that may not be in another culture?

* Eating Cow :P
* Staring/looking at other people (at least Americans tell me that)
* Eating horse (not the problems lately but for example eating horse salami or steak)
* FKK (completely naked bathing and camping)
* being honest (which is often taken as being rude in other cultures)
* piercings are more common and accepted than in other western countries

&gt;What kinds of things are socially unacceptable in Germany that may be in another culture?

* Death penalty
* Jaywalking *joking*
* Eating dogs,cats or guinneapigs

&gt;In your culture, is there a basis for determining good and evil? If so, who or what is it?

* yes, historically based on christianity, but we also get taught ethics in school that teach us common sense and morals

&gt;How is hospitality displayed in Germany?

* people are generally friendly and open
* if you get invited to visit someone, this is an honest invitation the first time it is mentioned (unlike in Aglo-Saxon countries where a ""you should come over some time"" means absolutely nothing)

&gt;What are the different venues of life (work, school, social occasions, etc.) and how do those look?

* Work, school, sports and sport clubs
* How do they look? CLean, mostly.
* In germany there are no real school sports like Football or Baseball in the US. Most sports are played in sport clubs that are not associated with the school.

&gt;How would you describe the mind-set of a typical German? What are his or her goals and ideals?

* open, determined, correct, humble
* golas are to provide for yourself or family (i.e. wife and kids) and find work at which you are good and you like to perform.

&gt;How do people deal with conflict?

* most people I know tend to address conflicts openly rather than getting angry and not telling the other party where the problem is
* discussion solves problems/conflicts faster

&gt;What do people do for fun?

* sports, gaming, reading, eating, hiking, skiing, surfing, paragliding
* everything possible in a first world country

&gt;What do most people think of God or any higher being?

* I am an atheist
* there are a lot of christions in germany. In the south are more catholics, in the north more protestants

&gt;What do you think of authority?

* I respect any authority as long as I am respected by it.

&gt;If you were to say that you really respect someone in your culture, what reasons would you give for respecting that person?

* Again, I need also be respected by that person. That person also needs to earn my respect (be it by doing something respectable or having achieved something respectable). This could also just mean being a good friend, father (to someone else), husband...",0,1362484508,null,0,false,0,c8q2y1d,t3_19p0pa,t1_c8q2y1d,t3_19p0pa,null,1431488336,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2

Not all socialists and communists would advocate the Soviet style system and there were many on the left who spoke out against it during the Soviet era. A ban on the glorification of acts of repression, and organisations that promote authoritarianism could equally prevent the dangers history has associated with communism without targeting an ideology which isn't *necessarily* bad.

I mean, the majority of people in the UK support hanging, does that make it something we should bring back?
