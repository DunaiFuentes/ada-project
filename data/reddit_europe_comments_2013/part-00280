In order of [population density](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_population_density) (not counting DC and territories), the population of New Jersey through California is [128.2 million](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+of+NJ+%2B+RI+%2B+MA+%2B+CT+%2B+MD+%2B+DE+%2B+NY+%2B+FL+%2B+PA+%2B+OH+%2B+CA), and Illinois through North Carolina is [32.2 million](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+of+IL+%2B+HI+%2B+VA+%2B+NC), for a total of 160.4 million, which os more than half (of 316 million, it's 2012 figures for those states).  
Those states' combined area is 1.077 million square km plus 428.5k square km, for a total of 1.5055 million square km. That's a population density of... damn, 108 people per square km. That's very close to our target of 112, though.

Let's see how many we can squeeze in so the density *is* higher. Swapping DC for VA + NC, we get 143.1 million people in 1255.5k square km, for a density of 114.

Bon tu me rassures. Mais tu peux comprendre mon désarroi quand je vois tout ce qui entoure la vidéo. Elle est effectivement très intéressante, mais la franc-maçonnerie en soit ne l'est pas. Ce n'est qu'un artefact stupide portant à son pinnacle le ridicule de l'orgueil des hommes de pouvoir, leur tendance fière à l'entre-soi, et l'énormité de leur complexe de supériorité.

Tu peux être contre leurs idées, ça s'arrête là.

&gt; Quel est le principe philosophique de la religion?

Chacune a les siens, avec des constantes et des variables. C'est assez simple pour les religions abrahamiques : Un écrit affirme l'existence d'un être suprême avec pour seule preuve la perfection dudit être suprême dont émane ladite écriture, il est l'origine de l'existence, de la morale, et de la loi, récompense ses fidèles par la béatitude éternelle et ses ennemis  par le tourment éternel. C'est un peu plus nuancé dans le Christianisme que dans l'Ancien Testament et dans le Coran, mais c'est à peu près ça.

&gt; Dis m'en plus sur le Dieu des religions s'il te plait, ça fait longtemps que je n'ai pas été sur /r/atheism et tu as l'air de tellement bien le connaître.

Tu n'as rien réfuté de ce que j'ai dit. Je ne t'ai pas encore bombardé de mèmes, d'images avec macros, ou d'aphorismes pourris, alors ne me confonds pas avec ces ploucs. Un athée = redditeur de /r/atheism ? Sors de chez toi. Si t'as des questions précises, j'y répondrais avec joie.

&gt; Pourrais tu me montrer que leur morale, offerte par la religion chrétienne, est creuse et infantilisante stp ?

C'est très simple. Dès lors qu'elle fait miroiter la promesse d'un châtiment ou d'une récompense, elle est infantilisante. Elle perd ainsi sa substance métaphysique (il faut être bon car Dieu est bon) ou philosophique (l'intérêt général et la quête commune du bonheur est plus important que la sienne), et devient creuse.

true,MightyMousePepTalk,UKGB,FIB - My life is a lie.,"A large reason for the Vetos was the fact that Britain still had its colonies. One colony was of particular concern to De Gaulle: New Zealand. New Zealand was considered ""a British Farm in the Pacific Ocean"" and the last thing De Gualle wanted was all their dairy products entering the European markets, harming the CAP and French farmers.

Furthermore, when Britain applied the first two times, it was still hoping it could bring its colonies into the fold. Britain was pursuing ways to expand the Commonwealth to all the nations, but still allow it to exert its influence over them. Britain was dealt a serious blow by India becoming a republic in 1950, meaning the British monarch was no longer the head of state in India. It signaled that Britain's influence over the Commonwealth members was waning, especially since Canada actively supported India in becoming a Commonwealth member as a Republic (if you change you political make-up (i.e. become a republic) you have to leave the Commonwealth and reapply) The final blow was when South Africa left in 1961.

South Africa wanted to become a republic, so it had to leave. It chose not to reapply because it knew it would not be accepted due to Apartheid. The Commonwealth does not question the internal politics of a member (at least, not then. It does more so now. But not nearly enough). So for SA to be denied would be for countries like Australia (White Only Policy) to be open for criticism. Britain wanted SA to be a member, India, other African members (Ghana, Nigeria) and Canada refuse to accept.

What all of the above shows is that Britain, when De Gaulle vetoed both times, was trying to involve its Empire in Europe, which was a big no-no for De Gaulle. When he left and Pompidou was president, Britain had long since given up on trying to create a closely integrated Commonwealth that it could control for trade. When Britain became a member, it was an island in North West Europe, not a global empire.

Apologies for the wall of text.

Tl;dr CDG did not want Britain in Europe as Britain wanted preferential treatment for its colonies such as New Zealand, whose agricultural products, if imported into Europe, would harm French farmers.

Quivi i principi di base (estendere e criticate a piacere)

Le carte nere possono stare stampate su un foglio, senza tagliarle ma numerate.

Le carte bianche vanno organizzate, a caso, in cartelle da 10.

Parte il gioco, si acquistano x cartelle ognuno.

Lo zar (sempre a giro) estrae a sorte un numero e legge la carta nera corrispondente.

I giocatori giocano una delle carte bianche che hanno, come nella versione originale. Lo zar decide il più meglio, ma chi vince la mano copre la cartella corrispondente con un fagiolone. Vince chi finisce una cartella per primo, facendo tombolone.

Pregi:
- natalizio
- può includere danaro, fomentando più odio tra i popoli
- non bisogna tagliare 43 pagine di cartoncino con forbicine dalla punta arrotondata

Maintenant, si on laissait au seul marché la responsabilité de la production de l'énergie, on aurait que des centrales au charbon les plus cheap qui soient, sur de seuls critères de rentabilité. Comme nous ne vivons plus dans les années 1950, on ne peut pas décider la construction d'un parc éolien national sans s'appuyer sur l'initiative privée, que l'on motive par un modèle économique rendu plus attractif.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Thanks - I still think your concerns are theoretical rather than real. The specific potential concern you mentioned, chipping away at privacy rights, does not strike me as real. Currently Britons have greater privacy rights than they ever had before, with the Human Rights Act (a law made by parliament) and the way this law has also further been developed by the courts. Parliament remains free to repeal the human rights act just as it was free to enact it and in fact, the Conservative party might put repeal of the HRA and enactment of a British Bill of Rights into its manifesto. But I'm not sure what is bad about this system. Britons will have a choice at the ballot box. And suppose Britons vote for the conservatives and then realise that they actually preferred to have the HRA? Well, they could then vote for a Labour government next time round and get the HRA back again....

As the article you linked to mentioned, almost nobody in Britain thinks that we need a formal written constitution and nobody really has argued the clear benefits it would bring. Laws should only be enacted to avoid specific harm, rather than theoretical harm. Most countries with written constitutions have written them after their various declarations of independence or revolutions or unifications or some other moment of historical significance and that is understandable and ties the constitution to the idea of the state. But Britain has never really had a big historical moment that has defined the birth of the state either. That notion has also evolved gradually. It seems a bit odd to choose 2014 as the moment in history that we want to codify everything. Also, there are huge advantages to having a flexible unwritten constitution : it means that when new challenges arise we can adapt to them easily, without formally needing to ratify the constitution. Why not let our constitution and notion of state continue to evolve gradually? We have got this far with it - surely we can go a little further?

Anyway : I think out constitution is rather beautiful in a peculiar, chaotic but still somehow efficiency and pragmatic way. I sense from your post that you also have an admiration for it too in spite of yourself.

Wirtschaftlich ""stramm rechts"" bedeutet vermutlich eher Ablehnung von Sozialleistungen und weitgehende Liberalisierung von Märkten. Rückbau von Staatlichen Monopolen und Privatisierung. Das sind doch klare Positionen von CDU und FDP - Parteien die eher dem rechten Spektrum zugeordnet werden.  

""Gesetzliche Härte"" klingt nach  ""Law and Order"" und ist auch in teilen der CDU und kleineren konservativen Splitterparteien zu finden.  

Nützliche Ausländer sind willkommen, das ist glaube ich sogar die NPD Linie, womit ich den OP nicht in die Nähe rücken möchte. Aber Begriffe wie Armutsflüchtlinge und Sozialschmarotzer finden sich eher in konversativen Rechten Parteien wieder. Nichts besonderes hier. 

&gt; Es mag dich schockieren, aber teilweise unterstütze ich auch Politik aus der linken Ecke, z.B. was Drogenpolitik, geistiges Eigentum und Energiepolitik angeht.

Kiffen möchte man aber dann doch und die Gängelung durch die Medienkonzerne findet man auch nicht so toll. Ich weiß jetzt nicht was dies mit Links zu tun hat. Energiepolitik ist auch eher Parteiübergreifend kontrovers. Da schimmert ein wenig Schwarz-Grüne Denke durch. In 5 Jahren gibt es die Passende Koalition ;)

""Linksfaschisten"" ist auch ein ""schönes"" Wort, was aus einer ganz bestimmten Ecke kommt, ist vielleicht keine Absicht vom OP. 

Warum sollte das kein rechter Mainstream sein?

I don't see any military threats against Finland in foreseeable future, unless something huge happens in world politics (WW3 or something akin to that). In that case shit's going to hit the fan anyway and politics and alignment are going to be much more important than any crappy defense a small country like Finland can put up.
4. I don't see how tanks are going to be of any use to Finnish defense anyway. No one's going to go up against a large (relatively speaking), sparsely populated and highly urbanized country like Finland in ground warfare; take over the air space, destroy infrastructure around major cities (roads and railways, supply of electronics and water, etc.) and Finland will fall in weeks -- especially if you do it during the winter. You can go even further than that, if you don't need to care about international reputation (which would likely be ruined anyway, if anyone was to attack Finland), and just bomb the cities to shreds; I doubt that there's going to be much of a resistance after a million or more casualties.

These tanks are just going to be expensive toys for militarists who are still living in the mid-1900s.",0,1387892388,null,0,false,0,ce97e3g,t3_1tj8wi,t1_ce97e3g,t1_ce95t9u,null,1428003804,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3

- 3,4€/h internships? (I am not kidding)

- 1.100€/month starting salary as a mechanical engineer, with little prospect of advancement?

- A 1 in 4 chance of admission to a medical residency, regardless of skill, because of budget cuts (and we do need the newly-trained physicians, according to our own forecasts)?

- 1000€/month salary for a full-time PhD candidate?

If you're interested, I suggest you read [this](http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/).

It's a very excellent article that discusses both the philosophical and practical issues with regards to the whole privacy debate.

These are the particular points I felt were most poignant (they are better read in context of course!):

* ""The nothing-to-hide argument stems from a faulty ""premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong."" Surveillance, for example, can inhibit such lawful activities as free speech, free association, and other First Amendment rights essential for democracy.""


* ""Another potential problem with the government's harvest of personal data is one I call exclusion. Exclusion occurs when people are prevented from having knowledge about how information about them is being used, and when they are barred from accessing and correcting errors in that data. Many government national-security measures involve maintaining a huge database of information that individuals cannot access. Indeed, because they involve national security, the very existence of these programs is often kept secret. This kind of information processing, which blocks subjects' knowledge and involvement, is a kind of due-process problem. It is a structural problem, involving the way people are treated by government institutions and creating a power imbalance between people and the government. To what extent should government officials have such a significant power over citizens? This issue isn't about what information people want to hide but about the power and the structure of government.""

* ""Yet another problem with government gathering and use of personal data is distortion. Although personal information can reveal quite a lot about people's personalities and activities, it often fails to reflect the whole person. It can paint a distorted picture, especially since records are reductive—they often capture information in a standardized format with many details omitted.""

* ""For example, suppose government officials learn that a person has bought a number of books on how to manufacture methamphetamine. That information makes them suspect that he's building a meth lab. What is missing from the records is the full story: The person is writing a novel about a character who makes meth. When he bought the books, he didn't consider how suspicious the purchase might appear to government officials, and his records didn't reveal the reason for the purchases. Should he have to worry about government scrutiny of all his purchases and actions? Should he have to be concerned that he'll wind up on a suspicious-persons list? Even if he isn't doing anything wrong, he may want to keep his records away from government officials who might make faulty inferences from them. He might not want to have to worry about how everything he does will be perceived by officials nervously monitoring for criminal activity. He might not want to have a computer flag him as suspicious because he has an unusual pattern of behavior.""

We've had the very same discussion in Denmark, and the conclusion I've reached is that placement of vastly different countries on the same list with very specific parameters is a bad way of doing things. 

Worst of all, the resulting reforms (in Denmark they were longer school hours, more Danish and Math lessons (disregarding other subjects), compulsory homework cafés, a more competitive environment, less freedom for the teachers, etc.) are, in my eyes, detrimental to the overall well-being of the kids. 

Sure they might be able to perform better in PISA and similar tests, but will they be overall better, intelligent, and most importantly, happy people? I've seen so many articles written by Danish gymnasium students who are complaining about the ""Race for grades"" that has been cemented in the last few years. There are so many unfortunate young people who are anxious about going to school, who are afraid that they won't have a future, who worry that they're not good enough, even when they try their very utmost.

I don't know if that's a society I want to live in, where competitiveness is valued over happiness.

That being said, I honestly feel the school system could very well be changed in Denmark (and many other countries, I suppose), from compulsory school to university level. The reforms that are being proposed are simply wrong, in my view, and there are many other viable alternatives.

true,bunburya,IREL,Hibernia,"Thanks for doing this!  A couple of suggestions:

- A couple of the statements are oddly worded.  Do I believe that homosexuality is moral?  I believe that it is morally acceptable, I do not believe that it is morally superior.  I'm sure you meant the first one, but the statement as I read it is rather ambiguous.

- Some of the opinion questions only give ""Yes / No / Don't know"" options.  Turkey, for example.  I see no reason why these questions can't be given the same 5 agreement level options as the other statements.  For example, I support Turkish accession to the EU in principle, but only subject to certain conditions relating to Turkey's human rights record etc.  So given the normal 5-point scale I would probably have said ""4"", but here I just had to say ""Yes"" which implies absolute support.

- I think sometimes the United Kingdom can be separated into its constituent parts, particularly where the questions are about the cultural aspects of the countries.  For example, I might want to say that Scotland is my favourite country in Europe but here I would have to select ""United Kingdom"".

- We could possibly have a couple of questions about the IRC channel in there?

Where's the evidence there was any conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism or murder (aside from after the fact?) none has been released, and I doubt there was anything more than circumstantial evidence - certainly not something that could be brought up and have them locked up following due process to prevent the crime.

And your missing something here, there is *no* judicial oversight in this. The ability for the state to remove someone's citizenship is extremely powerful, it removes many, if not all, their basic protections and rights under the law. Instead, it appears to be a law in which suspicion of such acts is enough for the executive to decide to remove these people's citizenship, and most troublingly there is very little in the way of safeguards or oversight in how it is done, how legally the security agencies gather evidence, and how these people could fight the decision if they feel they have wrongfully has their citizenship revoked. 

This is a power wide in scope and so open to abuse that it is ridiculous. I really don't understand how you can justify removing someone's citizenship for fighting against an oppressive regime in Syria (or even potentially just visiting relatives there), when they may have no interest in harming the uk or British interests. There is no public oversight of this, no transparency.

Half of the country is under an illegal military occupation by Turkey.

That it's illegal is in no way controversial. Every single country in the world (except of course Turkey) calls this occupation illegal. But it is nonetheless ongoing. 

That this is still going on today is probably due to the crassest of reasons. Turkey is a large, populous and strategically located country. And in exchange for being ""*friendly*"", buying lots of western products (especially expensive weaponry), not to mention siding with ""*Western*"" interests (even when they kill Muslims  by the tens of thousands), strongman Turkish regimes have been promoted as ""*good Muslims*"" (the population less so).

But this unholy arrangement requires a bit of a quid pro quo with the US and NATO also pretending not to notice ""*gross human rights violations*"" and that a Turkish military regime is currently occupying half of Cyprus.

Even the European Union itself plays ball with this. And consider that Turkey is actually occupying half a European Union member state! It's hard to believe that Europe has not responded in strength. One would think that an illegal occupation would provide a fairly robust cassus beli, wouldn't it? But apparently not. So far, ""*Oh it's complicated!* and other evasive bullshit always seems to win the day.  This is why Europe cannot be taken seriously.

Think of the insult to everyone's intelligence bullshit the USA used to attack poor, weak far away countries that didn't do anything to them. Their arguments were (and still are) so transparently absurd they seemed taken from US professional wrestling. Yet Europe went along and even helped them murder those poor mediaeval goat-herders. But all the while, European land was and is under occupation by a NATO ""*ally*"" and nobody said anything.

So, things are actually not that complicated, not really. Turkey needs to be told, in no uncertain terms, to get the fuck out of Cyprus, period, no ifs or buts. Only after it has kicked Turkey off Cyprus, might Europe be taken seriously, not a day before. Until that day, Europe will necessarily been seen as a joke by Turks ... and everybody else. 

Rather **un**complicated, isn't it?

true,MrJMaxted0291,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I'm not saying the key problem is inflation, but I do disagree that the cause of flat lining real term wages is unemployment.

While you argue that the overall EZ inflation is 0.8% it's important to note this is an average and all the member states individual rates of inflation vary drastically, so that figure is a bit misleading. 

For example, between 2008 and 2013 the UK rate of inflation has fluctuated wildly between 1.1% at it's lowest and up to 5% at it's highest over the span of the half decade. The individual rate itself on a month, quarter or a year is also misleading however. For a more accurate idea of the burden on the public's ability to spend you should take the cumulative effect of inflation over the years and compare it against it's respective rise in wages, which I will not comment on here as I can't find any data off hand.

Any attempt to paint countries like China as inherent aggressors serves no other purpose but justification of US domination. Your argumentation essentially boils down to geopolitics and not much else. This is so deeply ingrained in your thinking and collective consciousness of Americans (not only Americans, of course) since the Cold War that many are probably not conscious of it. This 'us vs. them' mentality isn't really all that helpful now. You take it as given that if certain ally of 'us' increases military spending the only meaning of it is to repel imminent threat of 'them' and grow closer to 'us' in this Manichean struggle of 'them and us'; if there is a quarrel over disputed territories or any other manifestation of East Asian nationalisms it is again nothing else but tension between 'us' and 'them', if there are any increasing ties between a third country and 'us' or a third country and 'them' it again means only one thing, siding of that country with 'us' against 'them' or with 'them' against 'us'. This whole framework is terribly reductionist and outdated. There is much more to this world than this. There are all sorts of interests and conflicts, not just one conflict between 'us' and 'them' and two groups of interests, those of 'us' and of 'them'. It's dishonest to equal interests of Vietnam or Philippines to interests of the US, even though they may have some sort of military partnership at the moment. It is indeed realpolitik, but realpolitik of a very different sort than what you describe.

Even then, I believe that moral judgement must still be applied here (and it is of course applied all the time by everyone). It's hard not to see great success of China in dragging 1.5 billions of its citizens out of abject poverty in one lifetime, serving as engine of growth for some of its neighbours as well as in Africa and Oceania. This is a huge net gain. In contrast, the US, with its prosperous economy, enormous soft power and political capital isn't doing much else but intimidating foreign nations and its own citizens through force.

The way I was taught, De Gaulle essentially unilaterally declared himself the new government of France after the legitimate French state capitulated to the Germans. Unlike the Polish, Dutch, or Czechoslovak governments in exile, De Gaulle had no legal power to exercise control over the instruments of French government. He performed a coup in exile, and the Allies just decided that the Nazi-collaborating government was ""illegitimate"" because the legitimate French government was an enemy country. It was convenient for the US and UK to pretend that Vichy France was not the legitimate French government, to rally loyal Frenchmen to their own banner, but De Gaulle did not exactly have any legal authority. Obviously, the US and the UK were not about to immediately accept the authority of some random, unelected French general as the natural leader of France when he created his government-in-exile out of nothing.

true,ohthehorrors,ASTR,TTIP delenda est.,"The first major problem with this free trade agreement is, that it will weaken the european economy by opening our markets to american companies. These american companies have a better position, as they do not have to contribute to working social systems, have weak environmental legislations to mind and do not have to comply with serious minimum wages. Why should we open our markets to vendors, who do not have to comply with local standards and are able to produce cheaper, because they are able to use questionable production methods like bathing meat in chlorine?

The second major problem are the antidemocratic elements of the free trade agreement. With this agreement, a company will be able to sue a country at an arbitrary court for its legislation not beeing compitable with the companies desire to maximize its profits. This means, that democratically elected legislators will loose their independence. National laws will have to follow the directives of an intransparent court we do not have controll over. If a legislation decides, that it wants to ban chlorine-bathed meat, it may not be able to so, because the obscure arbitrary court may decide, that has no right to do so. 

The third major problem is, that TTIP contains large parts of things like ACTA and GATS, that were stopped because they were unpopular. If these things should find their way under the cover of TTIP, we may find out one day, that the public hand is forced to privatise puplic transport, social housing, emergency services, the water supply and even parts of the government itself.

Why? Companies weren't concerned with retaining staff, they had no where to go. Companies weren't trying to attract staff, they didn't need them. Companies were laying staff off, they didn't need them. Wages go sticky, the inflation is relatively low, historically speaking.  Wages aren't increasing fast enough, attributable to the unemployment rate being high, so inflation is able to eat away at living standards. 

I guess another way to look at it is in terms of what the solution is. Is the solution slowing the rate of inflation? No, that'd reduce the incentive to invest and possible cause deflation (worse than hyperinflation). The solution is to get wages to increase. How do you do that? Well, the government can't mandate increased wages, and it can't afford to rapidly increase public sector wages (politically, and financially speaking), the only alternative is to increase employment so wages will begin to increase. 

If the solution is to try and encourage increased employment, and a reason that low employment rates might be causing the decreased quality of life, then doesn't it make sense that employment is the problem? Arguably, yes. Therefore, to be concerned with the rate of inflation, as opposed to unemployment, is non-sensical. 

The problem in this thread if the conflation of inflation with standard of living. Inflation isn't the only contributing factor and it's not what's causing the problem. ",0,1387904574,null,0,false,0,ce9asl4,t3_1tlojm,t1_ce9asl4,t1_ce9a05v,null,1428002217,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; **The number of unreported cases seems to be particularly high in Finland**: an estimated 2–10 percent of all rapes are reported, compared to around 25 percent in Denmark.

Also:

&gt; The countries’ criminal statistics are not comparable. Apart from the differences in the size of their populations, there are also different modes of recording rapes that are reported to the police. In Denmark and Norway the statistics record **cases** (generally one case for one victim), while in Sweden the statistics record reported **acts** of rape. If, for example, a woman is repeatedly raped by the same man during the course of one day, each rape will be registered as a separate offence. This is also true for cases where a woman is raped by a group of men. Hence, crime statistics in Denmark and Norway show how many people have reported rape, while the Swedish statistics show how many acts of rape have been reported.

Thereby giving credibility to what I quoted before:
&gt; The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention claims that it is not ""possible to evaluate and compare the actual levels of violent crimes... between countries"", but that in any case the high numbers are explained by a broader legal definition of rape than in other countries, and an effort to register all suspected and repeated rapes.

Merci donc de ne pas ignorer le POUR CERTAINS, en début de phrase.

À partir d'un certain niveau dans n'importe quel domaine scientifique, les notions inventées n'ont aucun sens hors de leur contexte et deviennent contradictoires avec le reste des connaissances. Un exemple parmi tant d'autres : on raconte aux enfants que la lumière est une particule qui se déplace de manière rectiligne, mais tu apprends ensuite que c'est des conneries. On apprend que la somme des angles d'un triangle fait 180 degrés, mais plus tard tu inventes des contextes où ce n'est plus vrai.

Ces histoires qu'on raconte aux enfants sont pour moi l'équivalent de ce que tu appelles fables improbables ou simplement idiotes, d'où ma réponse.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"Basically what is needed is a boost of efficiency and productivity to maintain the medium and long term sustainability of the system.

The current proposal is to go with the economies of scale where smaller service regions maintained by municipalities will be merged into larger ones to provide the services in their respective areas. Sounds simple but is all but. 

And to add to the complexity there's also the separate but related issue of municipal policy reform where small municipalities are encouraged to merge with their neighbourghs into larger ones - even with the prospect of forced mergers if nothing else works.

Both reforms are big and simultaneously doubly so. And both are opposed by many municipalities. And of course many people living in the scarcely populated areas are afraid of losing services or having poorer access to them, and of reforms creating more disparities between regions.

IMO the current proposal is bit half-assed and does not go far enough with the service region mergers by forming about 50 service regions. When reforming it would be better to do it more profoundly while at it as we're looking for long term sustainability here. I'd also like for the reformers to take a good look at Denmark and Sweden and their related reforms for lessons. In case of Denmark to see what works and what does not work when doing (forced) municipal mergers.

true,capnza,EURO,European Union,"Now you are just cherrypicking data points which support your opinions. Inflation talks about more than just food prices.

I haven't looked through your link (I'm on leave) so I don't know if they mean 12.6 percent above inflation or 12.6 percentage points above inflation (you should check that out) and if the 12.6 is an annualised figure or if it is quoted as an effective rate over the whole six year period (you should also check this). It seems much more likely to me that it is either quoted as a percentage rather than percentage points or that it is a six year effective rate, in which case it isn't saying what you think it is saying.

However, as per the following EZ inflation rate figures from 2001 (annual for all years except 2013, to November):

    2001  2.3 
    2002  2.2 
    2003  2.1 
    2004  2.1

    2009  0.3 
    2010  1.6 
    2011  2.7 
    2012  2.5
    2013* 0.5

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"He was indeed illegitimate, and that's why the US and UK weren't so eager to accept him as self-proclaimed leader, though the UK did harbor him out of interest hoping he'd spark resistance in France and rally Free French Forces.

What did give him some form of legitimacy for the French is simply that he did manage to impose himself as the prominent military leader of the Free French Forces (he did have some rivals for that position), so the hundreds of thousands of forces which did eventually rally Free France were under him. He managed to convince the Americans to let the Free French Forces liberate Paris, as a symbolic move. And since he was the highest ranked and most popular Free French military leader, the allies finally had to accept him, as they ultimately preferred him instead of possible Resistance leaders whom some were communist. (Btw, I don't think the US and UK cared whether the French leader was elected - they favored an Algeria-based French general as future leader of France, the latter much more conservative than De Gaulle already was).

As De Gaulle proclaimed a transition government, with legitimacy through his army, and legitimacy granted by the other allies, and considering the French were just happy to be liberated, they just welcomed it. And anyway, he simply proclaimed a transitional government, and democracy kicked back in shortly after.

However, the new Republic (4th Republic) felt weak. In that government, the president was largely a symbolic figure (like in today's Germany), there was no figurehead. And the French love them some actual figurehead - and the only possible candidate around was De Gaulle who's status had become practically mythical through the years. So in 1959, 15 years after the Liberation, the French wanted him, elected him democratically and he proclaimed the 5th Republic, wherein the elected President is the Head of state with important political power (like in the US). 

He only became more popular after his presidency as in hindsight he's viewed as a strong figure, with a beloved oh-so-French personality (while everyone else hates an arrogant Frenchman who doesn't take shit from anyone, the French themselves love their politicians to be that way).

If we assume a deflationary investment outlook, two asset classes (cash and equity) and two periods (now and the future) then we can look at the dynamics of a holding of cash versus a holding of equity over the period from now until the future.

The cash holding stays constant in nominal value (as it earns 0%) and thus increases in real value over the period due to deflation; a cash holding grows in purchasing power. The equity holding stays approximately constant in real value but *declines* in nominal value, as the value is given by the net present value of earnings, and future earnings will be lower than current earnings in nominal terms but approximately constant in real terms.

I understand the basis of the JSF, and yet the feasability of developing three versions of one aircraft to be a 5th generation stealth multi-role aircraft is far higher than that of developing three seperate 5th generation single-role aircraft.

To describe the plane as mediocre is idiotic. It's got optronics far in advance of any aircraft flying excepting the F-22, and in some regards it's superior. It's stealthier than any aircraft flying again excepting the F-22.  This idea that multi-role aircraft aren't any good is absurd.

The F-16 started as a single role light dayfighter and was developed into a multirole swing role fighter bomber and has been excellent at that for a good few years (although it's long in the tooth now). The F-15 was designed as an air superiority fighter and then developed to have the capacity to be an attack aircraft if required, and even further into the F-15E which is a dedicated attack aircraft which can defend itself where required. The F-18 started as a multirole aircraft to replace three or four single role aircraft, and once again has a great history, being developed further into the F-18E/F Super Hornet which is again, a fantastic aircraft for the money.

Honestly? Zilch. There is no unionist movement in the republic, no political parties advocate for it, and almost nobody would vote for it. You will rarely come across people that say they are in favour of it, but it's a fringe opinion. Most unionists left the Irish Free State in the 1920s, and most of those that remained came to accept independence. While we speak the same language and are culturally similar, Irish people in the republic generally do not consider ourselves British, so the UK government is seen as being as foreign as the French or German governments.

Not only that but also the results are kept secret. They are also kept secret from small and medium business owners, who also will not be heard.

The only ones who are heard and get to know the results of the negotiations are the big corporations. Which smells so strongly of favouritism that you couldn't smell a rotting skunk in the same room any more.

* 2 night in Rome

* 1 night in Amalfi coast

* 2 night in Sicily.

Other days are for the travels to and in Italy.

But you have to consider that:

* Sicily is very big so you have to choose few places

* All depends on the vehicles you want to use

If anything is brought to the guard's attention, he can press a button in the cab which puts some kind of marker on the footage. When people go to wipe the footage at the end of the day, the marker shows up so they know to archive it.

Most CCTV systems in the UK are like that - they just go on recording and overwriting old footage until something happens and video needs to be saved.

Fair enough. But my point was that they wanted one aircraft for the tasks now performed by different aircraft.

&gt; I understand the basis of the JSF, and yet the feasability of developing three versions of one aircraft to be a 5th generation stealth multi-role aircraft is far higher than that of developing three seperate 5th generation single-role aircraft.

This might be the case. Or it might not. I don't know that so i'll have to believe you. But even if true this only counts for the U.S.. We (the Netherlands) and others partners in the project need only one type aircraft. We don't have a navy with an own air force etc..

&gt; To describe the plane as mediocre is idiotic. It's got optronics far in advance of any aircraft flying excepting the F-22, and in some regards it's superior. It's stealthier than any aircraft flying again excepting the F-22. This idea that multi-role aircraft aren't any good is absurd.

This is all on paper. It has not flown in service yet and it will take many more years before it will. Also: the pilots are complaining that they can't look behind them. This can't be fixed with reverse engineering.

&gt; There's a lot of very uninformed nonsense going around about the F-35, largely based off people who've read the equally uninformed idiot journalists who slam the F-35 without any real understanding of modern fighter aircraft.

It is not about the aircraft. I'm sure you can buy a good aircraft for those billion dollars. It is also about how partner projects and even U.S&gt; congress has been tricked into developing this plane. They made false promises about the cost, about the jobs it would create and they shamelessly lobby for their own good. We wanted to  buy 85 planes. Due to rising cost it will be 37. LOL

And the funny part: we have absolutely no tasks for our military that couldn't be done with upgraded F-16's and drones. Hehe. But it is only taxmoney, right?

true,funwok,null,null,"&gt;1-Is it more expensive to live in Germany compared to cities in montreal?

Depends on the city. Some more trendier cities with strong economy like Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt are pretty expensive even on a international level. Especially apartments and houses, both renting and buying, are pretty costly in those cities. 

I think our VAT with 19% for most items is a bit higher than your combined sales taxes in Quebec. 

&gt;2-Is it easy to find jobs in Germany?

Depends on the job. Highly-educated and experienced professionals (especially in the IT sectors) are sought after of course. People with academic titles generally have it easier to find jobs in science fields (engineering, math, economics, finances etc.). The middle-class job sector is more competitive and you may need a proper European certification and training to get your foot in. Many jobs are still regulated by trade guilds.

&gt;3-How are black people treated in Germany?

Depends on the location too. Generally we don't have as many non-caucasian people here as in NA. People in general like to look and stare too. Most people don't care about your race, but they may be blatantly curios. Like anywhere in the world you may encounter racist idiots, especially in the economic weaker regions in the east they are stronger established in communities. In very rural regions you may encounter the 100% white people racism - they don't really have much experiences with other races and know mostly only clichés, so they may act stupid and say stupid things, but they don't really mean it bad. 

In the larger cities people are mostly like anywhere in the world - people generally can be negative about immigrant groups who don't integrate into the society easily and you may get some flak for it by association as obvious non-german.

However, there's usually a ""but"" to fast-track ""solutions"" like these. Let me explain why this is a solution on the expenditure of how much we value citizenship, essentially an instant depreciation of your freedom as well:

Citizenship is not only a mere passport that gives you rights to travel the lands as a citizen, it's also means the country has an obligation in the eyes of other countries to take full responsibility for you. By revoking citizenship a country doesn't just renounce said persons right to citizenship, the country also forces another country to take responsibility for these people. This is why we have statements of temporary vs permanent **recidency** in the first place. The whole deal with these is that they are statements you can revoke because they aren't a foreign contact, it's strictly a domestic agreement. When people start revoking the higher standard you actually downgrade/deprecate the value of citizenship to ""residency"" status.

So what should be done? Do not take on people, aka responsibility, you cannot handle in the first place. Don't accepct people you have doubts about or at least stand up for the responsibility you accepted. If it was as easy as just deporting all criminals over the English channel then it would already have been implemented.

true,NSA_Approved,EURO,Citizen of the Galaxy,"&gt; Finland's credible military comes from the people. Of course certain countries (cough Russia cough) could take over Finland, but as long as people are unwilling to give up, holding the ground is a nasty business

The point is: you don't have to hold the ground. If you control the air space, you can close off the major cities and how long do you think people are going to go without electricity, running water, necessary supplies, etc.?

If the Winter War had been fought with just 10-15 years more advanced technology (jet fighters, heavier bombers), Finland would have almost certainly fallen within days or weeks at most. Of course the invaders would not have been able to take over the land very quickly, but once the government gives in, they would have been forced to label all resistance fighters as terrorists and the supply lines would have stopped. Any significant ground forces would not be able to operate under such conditions and all that would remain would be small guerrilla groups.

Also, nowhere in my message did I imply that I was able to see the future. On the contrary: I stated that wars are certainly possible in the future (assuming some major political shifts), but if Finland gets caught in the power play of significantly larger parties, it's not the army that matters, but the politics and who you align yourself with.

This was true even back in the days of WW2: if it hadn't been for clever misdirection of the Germans, Finland would have been caught between both Germans and Soviets, and that would have almost certainly resulted in a disaster (the Continuation War was already a close call as it was and most likely the only reason Finland survived was the fact that after summer 1944 the Soviets concentrated more of their forces against the Germans and decreased the pressure against Finland).

And as for Finland's value: it does not lie in the people or in the infrastructure (or at least hasn't in the past), but in its geographical position. The most commonly held position on why the Soviets wanted Finland still seems to be the one that we were taught in history lessons when I was a kid: Finland was to act as a buffer against any possible invasions through the Baltic Sea (just as the Baltic States did a little further south).

Weniger auf römische Schildkröte machen, mehr auf ""Volle Pulle mit kleiner Truppe rein""). 

Problem ist IMO nur, dass es ein ziemlicher Adrenalinjob ist, in eine potentiell feindselig eingestellte Menge reinzulaufen, um dann dort Festnahmen vorzunehmen. Und entsprechend oft sehr grob abläuft. 

Ich hatte mal Gelegenheit, eine grössere Demo von erhöhter Perspektive zu sehen. War  faszinierend: Einer aus der Demo-Mitte warf was auf die Polizei. Man sah sofort Hektik rund um den Polizeifilmer und dann dauerte es noch fünf Minuten und ein Trupp von ca. 10-15 Bullen lief wie beim American Football in die Menge rein und genau auf jenen Werfer drauf. Jeder Demonstrant, der dazwischen gehen wollte und die Beamten bedrohte (versuchte Gefangenenbefreiuung), wurde sofort selber massiv bedroht. 

Statistisch hat der friedliche Demonstrant bei gezielten Festnahmen wohl bessere Chancen, heil nach Hause zu kommen. Aber wehe, er steht zufällig jenen Greiftrupps im Weg. 

EDIT: Anekdote: Eins meiner ersten Erlebnisse war mal als zufälliger Passant ne Demo gegen ""Isolationsfolter bei den RAF-Häftlingen"" Anfang der 80er. Um die Ecke vom Demozug wartete die Polizei. Ca. 100 Mann. Schweigend und angespannt.

En quoi, cela poserait-il problème ? L'inceste est un énorme tabou et il est encore très dur pour un homme de se déclarer victime, ni se sentir ""démasculinisé"" par l'acte. Il a fallu beaucoup d'évolution des mentalités pour que les hommes acceptent eux aussi de témoigner. Et c'est très récent. La *première* victime à témoigner à visage découvert lors d'une émission télévisée était une femme, Eva Thomas *en 1986*. Ça ne fait qu'une dizaine d'années que la parole s'est vraiment libérée et que les hommes témoignent à leur tour. 

&gt;Ouais, c'est vrai que la majorité homo c'etait une lutte exclusivement féministe.

Ce n'est pas ce que j'ai écrit, relis bien. Bien sûr qu'elles n'ont pas été les seules. Ce fut une lutte commune. Mais ça fait partie de leurs revendications historiques. Je n'ai pas à prendre position. Le constat documenté sur l'histoire du MLF et du FHAR, c'est que l'activisme homosexuel en rupture avec la discrétion réformiste d'Arcadie dans les années 60 est né au sein du MLF et qu'il s'est ensuite diffusé.

&gt; *En France, la première grande action du militantisme homosexuel a lieu au début de l’année 1971. (...) À l'époque, l'action est essentiellement organisée par des lesbiennes, parmi lesquelles de nombreuses militantes féministes et notamment l’écrivaine Monique Wittig mais au fil des mois, la composante masculine du FHAR augmente de manière constante.*

true,LiamtheFilmMajor,null,null,"That's all well and good that you intend to simply put guns into the hands of law abiding citizens, but if you make weapons more available to the public, it makes it easier for anyone to get them. Yes, people trying to get firearms illegally will most likely still be able to get them even if law abiding citizens can't, but making them free to buy for anyone, despite restrictions, is going to be easier to acquire no matter what. 

[Guns lead to gun deaths.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2012/12/gun_death_tally_every_american_gun_death_since_newtown_sandy_hook_shooting.html) It makes sense, yes, law abiding citizens can buy guns (yay), but that also means that it's also, relatively, easy for non-lawabiding citizens to acquire the same guns. Then, you may run into similar problems that the US faces in terms of trying to put restrictions on who can buy guns, where people who care about their gun rights will fight tooth and nail against background checks, waiting periods, and caliber restrictions. That may sound ridiculous to some, but it's a real issue, that horribly divides the US. 

Guns are the leading cause of gun deaths. Period. Legalizing them for some, makes them more accessible to all, and I don't think that's a barrel of monkeys that France needs to open. Obviously I am not French, I'm from NYC, but having grown up listening to repeated stories of shootings, gun violence, and even accidental deaths without any sort of change makes me very wary about the slippery slope that is the world of gun legalization. It's a shame because I know many people, my grandfather included, who love to safely hunt for sport, but it's nigh impossible to make guns available to few, while keeping them out of the hands of everyone who would look to misuse them.

Separatism is almost exclusively tied to Flemish nationalism, which only came to exist about a century ago as a reaction to (both perceived and real) disenfranchisement of dutch speakers by french speakers. This originally just pro dutch language movement slowly evolved into nationalism where dutch speakers are Flemish and french speakers, even those born and raised in Flanders, aren't. The original unhappiness with the francophone ruling class, both ""flemish"" and ""walloon"", got reinterpreted as oppression of the Flemish people by the Belgian elite and started the separatism.

Wallonia however was never really dominated by language issues and thus didn't form an identity tied to it as separate from the Belgian state. Due to flemish influence they've become in favor of a federal state as well, rather than the earlier unitary state, but definitely one single state. There's no Walloon nationalism or separatism with any significant support.

The german speakers especially have a vested interest in staying Belgian. What's basically a non contiguous group of 7 villages of together 75 thousand people have their own parliament and government with far reaching autonomy regarding education, labour, culture, ...

true,Daniele86,ITAL,Italy Bravo Bravissimo,"&gt; The drive for the Euro has been motivated by politics not economics. The aim has been to link Germany and France so closely as to make a future European war impossible, and to set the stage for a federal United States of Europe. I believe that adoption of the Euro would have the opposite effect. It would exacerbate political tensions by converting divergent shocks that could have been readily accommodated by exchange rate changes into divisive political issues. Political unity can pave the way for monetary unity. Monetary unity imposed under unfavorable conditions will prove a barrier to the achievement of political unity.

I thought this part was more interesting to be honest. It's a fair assessment I think. But it is also a uniquely british problem in Europe. It is the only european nation that has deep sovereign and institutional ties with first world developed nations that are outside of Europe (New Zealand, Canada, Australia etc). The choice of whether to deepen those ties or deepening its european ties is not a dilemma faced by the Germans or the French or Spaniards etc who do not have its equivalent. It's Europe or bust.

It is implicit, people don't go around saying ""What about that empire eh? Pretty impressive huh?"". There is however celebrations of silly little battles years past, sacred cows in the form of the Mother of Parliaments and the royal family, and an automatic assumption that it is the UKs duty to interfere in the affairs of other countries (Iraq and Afghanistan both really were fuck ups). There is no real effort to deal with our dark past whereas other countries have had it forced upon them (still often hear excuses about building railways and introducing civilizations and other tosh).

We also fairly self obsessed and very much look inwards within the UK (by which I mean London). There is a lack of reporting on European affairs in the media, when something about another European country is mentioned it is nearly entirely negative. Comparisons to other European countries when policies are introduced barely get mentioned (excluding the occasional token reference to Finland). 

There exists an insular culture that feels itself alien to Europe and one of the results of this is an outdated foreign policy.

And believe me, nation as stubborn as Finland is willing to resist possible invader, polls show constantly about strong will to support the defense forces and keeping the service mandatory. The idea of guerrilla warfare isn't to be supported by the government. Why would it be dependent on something it's not even supposed to be dependent on? Even the elderly can throw a grenade... even a child can operate an assault rifle. Of course the cities would turn into a devastating warzone, but when we are discussing about ""credibility"" of the defenses, the will to defend has a major factor in it.

Finland being between larger party powerplay? How? Russia has enough nukes to end all life from earth, and they have their Dead Hand-program ready to revenge any possible nuclear attack on Russia. I can hardly see any major power being able to seriously threat Russia (or any other superpower) without an upcoming nuclear war. In case of nuclear war, no one will give a fuck about Finland, or any other country... it's too damn total. No...there's no way that kind of powerplay would be played in the near presence of any superpower, it would (and it has) be (been) a fight of 2 sides in some 3rd world country where both sides support other side in last 50 years. Nuclear weapons really have bring stability to the world.

Finland survived from the Continuation war due to Stalin willing to rush to Berlin before Western Allies+due to the fact the Grand Offensive of Summer 1944 was countered (new offensive would have needed preparations, resources and time, which Stalin didn't have).

Finland's wealth is built by it's people, if invader doesn't want a wasteland the infrastructure should stay. What comes to geopolitical situation, it doesn't really matter anymore, as already explained, superpowers can't be fighting each other directly. Geopolitical location was important in 1940's, but not anymore. I repeat: Only think which makes Finland worth more than let's say, a slice of Sahara is the infrastructure and the people which are willing to keep the country running. Destroy infrastructure and turn people against you and you have absolutely nothing.

Re: transnational arbitration. According to the negotiation guidelines approved by the European council, the transnational arbitration (ISDS) will only be on the table if its of the highest calibre, transparent, and most importantly (the Americans weren't happy at all) if it in no way interferes with the right of governments to protect consumers and the environment.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Fair enough. But my point was that they wanted one aircraft for the tasks now performed by different aircraft.

Kind of. What you're missing, and this is vital, is that this isn't just an aircraft which is combining what those aircraft did into one model, this is an aircraft which is bringing significantly improved and advanced capabilities over and above those found in the previous generations. Stick the optronics of the F-16 in an F-35 and ignore stealth and is the F-35 a better A2A aircraft than the F-16? Well probably yes, but certainly it's closer. But that's ignoring the massively improved Electronic Warfare, sensor integration, and most importantly stealth aspects that an F-35 has which an F-16 doesn't. You can make similar comparisons for all other aircraft it's replacing. Was it feasable to make a 1 for 1 replacement at this level of sophistication for every single plane being replaced? No. The cost would have been absurd.

&gt;But even if true this only counts for the U.S.. We (the Netherlands) and others partners in the project need only one type aircraft. We don't have a navy with an own air force etc..

Right, but you can't afford to develop an aircraft which is anywhere near as good as the F-35 is. Your airforce is already buying off the shelf kit. You currently fly F-16's. Those are long in the tooth and coming to the end of their life as competitive aircraft in terms of modern air combat, so sooner or later NL has to upgrade. It makes sense to go for a 5th gen aircraft.

&gt;This is all on paper. It has not flown in service yet and it will take many more years before it will. Also: the pilots are complaining that they can't look behind them. This can't be fixed with reverse engineering.

Well no, that's not true at all. There are 100 airframes already flying so this is anything but ""all on paper"". It will still be several years before it's finished being tweaked to a level that LM and the US Govt. will certify it for active service, but that's not a damnation on the aircraft. Eurofighter took nigh on two decades to go from drawing board to active service, and it's a far simpler aircraft.

You say ""this can't be fixed with reverse engineering"" but that's utterly untrue. Aircraft are continually modified and adapted and revised. The idea that anything is set in stone on an aircraft which will probably number 3500-5000 airframes in its total lifespan, when only 100 have been built so far, is absolutely absurd and demonstrates an utter lack of understanding of the incremental adjustments which occur in aircraft development both prior to and post active service.

&gt;They made false promises about the cost, about the jobs it would create and they shamelessly lobby for their own good. We wanted to buy 85 planes. Due to rising cost it will be 37. LOL

Welcome to military procurement, where governments want everything for nothing, promise to fund X items, cut back expenditure later, companies get nervous and start to cover their own asses (slowing things down, creating more stretches of the truth). In short, this happens with nigh on every bit of kit. It sucks I agree but lets not pretned there's any options out there at this time which are particularly better.

&gt;And the funny part: we have absolutely no tasks for our military that couldn't be done with upgraded F-16's and drones. Hehe. But it is only taxmoney, right?

true,canard_glasgow,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;Oh cmon, that's not only a joke, but a self-deprecating joke because of the World Cup win being in 1966.

It is an increasingly tired joke. What is now the UK was very fortunate and (internal fighting aside) hasn't had any serious invasion since the Normans. There is an arrogance. The politics leading to WW1 is often overlooked and there is a narrative of WW2 where Britain stood alone against evil German expansion, ignoring the rest of the British empire.

&gt;Are you going to accuse Canada, Australia, New Zealand and all the other Commonwealth members with QE2 as their head of state as wanting their own empires now?

My point was that the political system in the UK has not changed since the empire days, and furthermore there is still little to no talk of reform. The current foreign office is just the old foreign office a hundred years later. 

&gt;Regardless of that, they had nothing to do with Empire, if so we did a pretty bad job with the whole facilitating democratic elections and leaving after a few years thing, no?

We can't detach ourselves from the current problems in the middle east. We've been in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq for years.*

But it is more to do with how the UK sees its role in international relations. We fall in line with American foreign policy and go against the UN. When people go on about the UK's nostalgia for the Empire, this is the sort of thing they are referring to.

&gt;You don't seem to understand what the News is, it's always negative, that's what it does, do you really think that in other EU nations there's constant programming about the boring debates on deciding standardised salt content in packets of crisps? 

Often when policies are going through in the UK the same stuff is happening elsewhere or has already been done. The media really doesn't perform analysis on this (the earlier examples you gave of free schools, German economy. These are more often points pushed by politicians and reported as such). Citizens of other European countries tended to be more clued up on what their neighbours are doing (also what the UK is doing).

true,Leonichol,EURO,European Union,"&gt;European institutions are not really functioning any more. Why? Because of a lack of leadership

More so than any other, this is the penultimate problem facing the EU project. There is just no leadership, no set of powerful leaders with the ability, charisma, trust and ability to lead the European Union to its end goals. The president certainly doesn't count, and the Council is far too parochial to even be considered - this is inclusive of Ms Merkel, for all the progress she has achieved.

At the end of the day, Member State leaders are aligned to the interests of their country, and European leaders are far too useless to be effective. If we wish this union to succeed there is no other choice than to strip even more sovereignty - a high price to pay for the EU3 who are yet to fully fathom the cost-benefit of this scenario.

For France we have the loss of protectionism. The ability to control its own economy and enact measures which ensure its citizens are rightly protected from the contestable benefits of globalisation.

For Germany we have the loss of an immensely beneficial economic policy which strengthens it at the cost of almost all weaker member states.

For the United Kingdom we have the loss of an informal soft power relationship, projectable military power, historically beneficial trade links, and a diaspora which has resulted in the primary economic system and formation of some of the most developed countries in the world.

Yet with the right leadership, none of these items need be losses - they could instead be strengths. French protectionism could be European protectionism. German economic mastery could be the formation behind European economic integration in the form of balance of payments throughout member states. British diaspora could be the fundamental international relationship of the EU in a economic, cultural and military sense.

Yet as it stands these are COMPETING interests rather than COMPLEMENTARY interests. And that, is a god damned shame. We have population regions trying to become independent of their parent states, when what we should have is member states attempting to better the whole with the end game in mind - we are stronger together than we are apart.

If an EU3 state ever elected a Government with a European outlook as their primary modus operandi, they stand to be at the formation of the most powerful, free, culturally beneficial, rich and significant geopolitical unit of the last 1000 years with perhaps many more to come.

There was a need for heavy armor when the Warsaw Pact still existed, but the fall of the Soviet Union changed the balance of power. It is highly unlikely Russia would want to fight Nato (unless they've got serious suicidal tendencies). 

2. Finland's situation is different. It is not a Nato country, and has 1000+ kilometers of border with Russia. Last time Russia invaded its neighbouring country was just five years ago (Georgian war).

3. Tanks are gradually getting more obsolete, but are not there yet. It depends on against whom you fight. Russia's army is still based on heavy armor, artillery and air power - not smart munitions, UAVs and other high-tech gear. Their attack on Georgia was just that: heavy armor. To defend oneself against battle tanks, one needs something more than computer viruses. Hence, Finland still has interest in these 'obsolete' things. If it wasn't for the budget cuts, Finns would probably buy also those PzH2000s.

4. Price-wise it is not a bad deal for either party, provided it is somewhere around 200M euros. After the Indonesia deal went sour, it is probably a relief for the Dutch they can still get similar or even better quote from Finns.

true,globaltyler,GERM,Germany until further notice,"&gt; Second, the democratic deficit that people always complain about is bullshit. It's a myth spun by people that don't understand either how the EU system works, or have some strange notion of what democracy is.

It is not a myth, otherwise the idea that the EU is democratically legitimated would also classify as a myth. Then all we would have done is to rename legal theories into myths.

The idea that a democratic decision (the national elections) legitimize via free mandate to give some of those powers to appointed people in a supranational and intergovernmental organization is one legal theory.
There are other legal theories that say that one democratic decision at the base is not enough, especially if that decision goes up to many levels. You can easily argue that a national election gives the mandate to form a national government and govern the country. It also via historic tradition mandates the government to negotiate treaties with foreign powers. But something like the EU, that's forming a government to then form another government and legislative council in one and no proper control on what that council above the government is agreeing on. That's stretching this part quite thin. It has happened quite often that members of the government of a national state have gone against the will of their parliament (sometimes not even behind closed doors) to force something through that would not have been possible in normal national process because parliament would not have passed the respective law.

One of the other deficits of the EU is the fact that national parliaments give powers to the EU council which is supposed to act as legislative on EU level but is part of the executive on national levels, that one is a bit difficult when it comes to separation of powers.

Then we have the fact that the EU was created and its framework still works as a supranational organisation, meaning it is treaties between countries. But actually a lot of the EU already works like it is a federal state, which it isn't. As the German constitutional court (so much for ""myth"") delicately put it - there is the danger that parts of the EU become selfstrengthening and gain too much power without proper democratic control.

And there is this passage from its 2009 ruling considering the Lissabon treaty that deals with the EU parliament:
„Gemessen an verfassungsstaatlichen Erfordernissen fehlt es der Europäischen Union auch nach Inkrafttreten des Vertrags von Lissabon an einem durch gleiche Wahl aller Unionsbürger zustande gekommenen politischen Entscheidungsorgan mit der Fähigkeit zur einheitlichen Repräsentation des Volkswillens. Es fehlt, damit zusammenhängend, zudem an einem System der Herrschaftsorganisation, in dem ein europäischer Mehrheitswille die Regierungsbildung so trägt, dass er auf freie und gleiche Wahlentscheidungen zurückreicht und ein echter und für die Bürger transparenter Wettstreit zwischen Regierung und Opposition entstehen kann. Das Europäische Parlament ist auch nach der Neuformulierung in Art. 14 Abs. 2 EUV-Lissabon und entgegen dem Anspruch, den Art. 10 Abs. 1 EUV-Lissabon nach seinem Wortlaut zu erheben scheint, kein Repräsentationsorgan eines souveränen europäischen Volkes. Dies spiegelt sich darin, dass es als Vertretung der Völker in den jeweils zugewiesenen nationalen Kontingenten von Abgeordneten nicht als Vertretung der Unionsbürger als ununterschiedene Einheit nach dem Prinzip der Wahlgleichheit angelegt ist.“

They basically say that EU parliament in its election system and its powers is not compliant with a real parliament which is needed in a democratic system. That's why the German constitutional court says they still reserve the power to check all acts of the EU to ensure they don't destroy the identity of the German constitution or overreach their powers.

The German constitutional court is also one that I have high hopes for when the time will come to shoot a overreaching TTIP treaty that will destroy the values of our constitution out of the water.",0,1387973528,null,0,1387973782,0,ce9u2vw,t3_1tls7a,t1_ce9u2vw,t1_ce9geqe,null,1427992064,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It's also your right to believe that the current crisis is just a small hiccup that will be overcome if you just give it some time.

However, for your information, that was not the case for the previous economic crash of 1929. It took a massive public spending programme and a world war for the economy to restart. And as for the specific issue at hand, immigration, it's laughable that you and /u/NeutralGreek think it won't have any permanent effects. Greece has already gone through a couple periods of massive immigration, [the latest one being in the late 40s and 50s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_diaspora) and the vast majority of them never returned, except maybe for a few that returned for their retirement. The fact of the matter is that there has never been an industrial or intellectual renaissance in Greece that can be attributed to returning immigrants in modern history. But sure, help yourself, paint me as a hopeless pessimist and side with the guy who's spouting wishful nonsense. Not everyone can handle the truth when it's harsh. 

Anyway, ""permanent"" is a funny word. Nothing is permanent in the very long term. And nothing is of real consequence, not even the entire sum of human death and suffering, compared to the fast approaching heat death of the universe.

It's just this 21st century period where less people want to and will work in agriculture and so people mostly leave to live in city.

Bad/crazy people will always find a way to do their dirty work no matter what. The only way to balance this, is to give people the means to retaliate.

Moreover, it's all about the odds too. If you know murdering someone will put in jail for a decade or so and ONLY IF the investigation come to the right conclusion. The bet may seem worthy. In the other hand, if you add to those odds, the fact you may be shot during the process. Things may not seem so easy or attractive. 

Anyway, in France, most of the criminals over 18 attacking the L.A.C. are drug dealers; meaning they have to own guns (usually ak-47) to secure their business.

true,Jonisaurus,EURO,European Union,"&gt;You're essentially saying that all Brits are closet imperialists just waiting for the trigger word to usher in the Second Reich of the Most Excellent British Empire

Wha...what? I merely said it's not a conscious feeling but a more subtle attitude among people. Not a belief in the old empire but a remnant attitude or feeling that's left.

&gt; I'm sorry but what? Lots of people all across the Commonwealth believe that it's an underexploited resource/cooperation.

Do they? Pretty much the entire left-wing spectrum in the commonwealth realm is very unenthusiastic. It's simply a pipe dream. These countries orientate towards what brings most benefit. America for Canada, Asia for Oceania. The reason we feel it's 'underexploited' is because it's a fantasy.

&gt; UKIP's platform is that exiting the EU would allow us to negotiate our own FTAs and deepen ties with countries much closer to us in terms of language, culture and shared history

You're extremely absolutist. I often find British kids and Dutch kids have more in common than British and Aussie kids. Sure, in language they might not, but in other things like way of life they do. Extremely anecdotal.

&gt; to represent that as a mainstream view, or even anti-Europe is totally disingenuous and you're misleading people by saying it.

It's not misleading. Nigel Farage is very clever in this. He clearly presents the Commonwealth as an alternative to the EU rhetorically because when he's done saying why the EU can't work he brings up the Commonwealth and its benefits. It might not be written like that in the party program but it very, very clearly is the contrast UKIP creates. It is rather obvious, and that's why critical journalists attack UKIP here often.

&gt; A Brit would feel much more at home in a place like Canada, America, New Zealand or Australia than in France, Holland, Finland or Bulgaria (and vice versa), that's not a slight to Europe it's just reality, pretending that we have everything in common with Germany or whoever is simply a pointless, silly, forced exercise.

I don't believe that to be true. No one has everything in common. There loads of British people in continental Europe and we always joke together with other Euros about how weird Aussies are. It's a lot more nuanced than you make it seem.

&gt; Are you British? I've honestly never heard that and if it does exist (I'm sure someone has said it) then it's hardly a common view.

Obviously you've never heard it like that because I didn't mean it literally. I tried to boil down how commentators and politicians express themselves. My feeling is simply that the whole 'expand the commonwealth, they're much closer to us than Europe' sentiment is ludicrous.

&gt;Contradiction in terms...

No merely an exception for Germans...

&gt;I don't know why people believe there's some enlightened worldly views outside of it, because everyone is just as self-obsessed as Britain.

Not more enlightened, just a different kind of attitude.

true,McNorch,gamer,,"Allora,  premetto che non ricordo bene tutte le regole, peró, sostanzialmente,  é un gioco di carte che si usa dalle mie parti (Ciociaria, ma penso sia diffuso nel resto d'Italia) di solito a Natale, ma nei bar di paese ci giocano pure a ferragosto (anche se come gioco d'azzardo é tecnicamente vietato). 

Praticamente ci si giocano soldi, o nella variante alcolica la ""passatella"" vengono utilizzati i punti per determinare il ""padrone"" e il ""sotto"" i quali decidono a chi tocca tracannare il vino o la birra.

Ci servono da 3 a 5 giocatori e un mazzo di carte napoletane, viene determinato un mazziere, che cambia a ogni giro. Prima si mette la ""puntata""  nel ""piatto"" la somma minima per ogni mano, che viene decisa tra i giocatori, poi vengono distribuite 3 carte a ogni giocatore.

Lo scopo del gioco é ottenere il punteggio massimo con le carte dello stesso seme, si usano i punti della primera: 7 vale 21, 6 vale 18, asso 16,  5 vale 15, 4 vale 14, 3 vale 13, 2 vale 12 e le figure 10.

una mano vale un minimo di 10 fino a un massimo di 55, ogni giocatore a partire da quello alla destra del mazziere (il giocatore che ""sta di mano"", nel caso di paritá punti vincerebbe colui che ""sta di mano"" tra i due o piú contendenti) puó puntare una somma di denaro o passare. Finito il primo giro I giocatori possono decidere se ""rilanciare"" o se ""stanno bene"".

Vince la somma puntata solo durante quella mano (non tutto il, piatto) chi ha in mano il punteggio piú alto, se tutti passano, il mazziere prende un dazio dal piatto (di solito una puntata minima). Chi vince la mano non é costretto a mostrarla a meno che non sia contesa con un altro giocatore, (qui non ricordo bene come funziona, ma uno dei due chiede se un certo punteggio é ""buono"" ovvero se con quel punteggio potrebbe vincere la mano e l'altro in base a quel punteggio deve moostrare le carte, ma puó scegliere di mostrare solo le carte che sommate battano quel punteggio in modo da poter tenere sulle spine gli avversari per la ""puntata grossa"")

A fine mano, le carte vengono posate da ogni giocatore, non vanno restituite al mazziere e si ricomincia, fino a quando tutte le carte sono state distribuite.

A quel punto si fa la ""puntata grossa"" dove un giocatore puó utilizzare 3 carte dello stesso seme tra le carte ""posate"" e seguendo lo stesso procedimento usato nelle mani precedenti ci si gioca il piatto + eventuali puntate aggiuntive.

Finita quest'ultima mano si procede alla ""stoppata finale"" chi é di mano butta una carta e continua ad aggiungere una carta alla volta in senso crescente, quando non ha carte per continuare la serie si passa al giocatore successivo fino all'esaurimento delle carte, chi esaurisce prima le carte riceve dagli altri giocatori un premio per ogni carta in mano agli avversari. Non bisogna iniziare dalla carta piú bassa, di solito dalla piú conveniente per il giocatore di mano, arrivati al re il giocatore puo decidere da quale carta riniziare, se si hanno 4 4 in mano si possono buttare tutti insieme. La stoppata peró puo non iniziare se un giocatore si dichiara ""pezzente"" quando ha piú di 3  due. in tal caso il pezzente prende il premio per ogni carta in mano agli avversari.

Sono sicuro di aver ommesso qualche regola, e di aver dimenticato qualcosa ma piú o meno funziona cosí.


TL DR: é 'na specie di poker all'Italiana.

EDIT:  ovviamente ci sono molte varianti regionali, a volte anche paesi vicini hanno piccole varianti, ad esempio per la versione alcolica ""la passatella"" le regole sono molto piú flessibili, lí poi c'entrano anche le rivalitá tra amici, i veti sulle brocche di vino/birra. Li se vuoi bere devi essere uno abile nell'arte della diplomazia, o se sei uno che beve poco devi essere bravo a stoppa altrimenti torni a casa in coma etilico.

true,capnza,EURO,European Union,"OK, another basic one but demand-side this time: the effect of deflation on household debt. This isn't 100% rigorous but it's Christmas day so I don't want to spend too much time on this.

Again, two time periods and a deflationary outlook including falling nominal unit wages (or constant real unit wages); we consider households with nominal debt (e.g. a mortgage loan amortising over a fixed term).

In the current period the household receives some quantity of income which it can allocate to debt repayment, savings and consumption. We can assume that the household has no savings in the current period, in which case the debt amortisation completely determines the income available for current consumption. We don't lose any explanatory power by doing this, think of it as starting in a period where the household already has insufficient income to save after making the amortisation payment.

In the future period the household income has now decreased in line with deflation but the debt amortisation remains constant (fixed term on nominal debt). Thus the household must reduce consumption compared to the previous period. If the consumption of all households falls, we have (roughly) a fall in aggregate demand.

Stated otherwise: deflation increases the real burden of debt (whereas inflation reduces it).

What sort of question is that?

The implication when people crow about Britain and cameras is that we're some kind of Orwellian surveillance state. Pointing out that those cameras aren't looking in peoples homes or streets but are owned by private companies looking over their own properties (supermarkets, malls, factories and industrial estates, etc) and that the government in no way forced companies to have them, completely nullifies the idea.

&gt;policy of arbitrary surveillance of public space

That's not a thing. That doesn't exist here.

Non-privately owned cameras are either on / within governmental property for security reasons, or at major city road junctions / roundabouts or city centres. The former of the last two is for reasons of traffic, where the latter is for the reasons of drunk people on the weekends.

America gives the people in Britain who would have been redcoats massacring ""savages"" in the 19th century a voice and relevancy in the 21st century. 

Like I said, Britain never really had a post-imperialist period like other countries simply because it basically attached itself as the 51st state of the US whilst the empire was slowly being disbanded. So that has basically carved out the national psyche we have today. 

Even countries like Canada have a very nationalist/militarist streak (that is increasingly growing) that is only enabled because it sucks off the teat of the US. Without America, countries like Britain, Canada and Australia would have to act as 'normal' or rational nations instead of supreme dickheads (at least in terms of foreign policy) with a massive penchant for violence and destruction.

This is why I really can't wait until the US loses much of its power in a multi polar world. The US is giving the far right/conservatives etc in Britain.. far too much relevancy in a world where they should be non-existent. We need more peace, not violence.

Alright guys thanks for all the help the solution is,  as you would expect from a grown man who has been doing laundry since he was in middle school, laughably simple. The problem I (and my two sisters btw) was having is basically I didn't know what was on and what was off.

So pushing the button jumps the light from the left to the right and vice versa.

The positive of this is that there simply isn't enough time to develop the network, expertise, and contacts required to do any large-scale corruption.

Then, once we have our answer, we can ask a second question: 'Is constructing a federal EU superstate the best way to achieve these goals? Are there any alternative methods that would better achieve these ends?'

For example, an idea that gets thrown around a lot is having some sort of EU army to better project military force and protect EU values and interests. If we ask the questions posed above, I would argue that the end goal is to pool European countries' military forces to create a single, strong and cohesive military might, avoiding waste and duplication, to better project EU power. This is a commendable goal, IMO. However, if we think about it, EU countries still differ widely in the use of force, when it is appropriate, when it should be used, how it should be used, how much money they are willing to invest, etc... Therefore, a common EU army where all 28 EU member states have a say (in other words, an EU army which would require the consent of all 28 member states to be deployed) would not work well in practice, and would hardly ever be used.

So, are there any other methods with which we can achieve a stronger EU military rpesence in the world? Perhaps a better solution, instead of full-blown military integration, would be to strengthen the already-existing European Defence Agency. Currently, it merely advises EU member states in how they could spend their military budgets to cooperate. If it were strengthened and given more power, it could better coordinate EU militaries without the member-states feeling like they are losing sovereignty or national power. For example, currently in Europe there are 17 different types of battle tanks. This makes it difficult to coordinate missions, launch joint operations, loan tank battalions to partner countries, and there are loads of software and technology interoperability problems. A simple act like gradually getting all EU countries to, over time, begin purchasing the same class of battle tanks would do wonders for EU military power.

A good example is the recent decision by 7 or 8 EU countries to jointly develop an EU surveillance drone is a step in the right direction. All countries are free to spend more or less; to have more or fewer of the drones, and to participate freely in military missions. The real step forward here is that military cooperation becomes much easier and more practical if all EU countries are using the same military hardware and software.

The problem is that there has never really been much public support for a United States of Europe, demonstrated by the large discrepancy between the results of European elections/referendums and national elections (Eurosceptics get voted into the European parliament, while national parliaments are almost completely dominated by parties in favor of increased integration).

Most economists would argue that a monetary union without a fiscal is very unrealistic, so why was the Euro adopted before we had a fiscal union? It is a great example of the approach to European integration lead by the most cynical federalists, supporting the euro while telling electorates that it is 'only' a common currency, and that there are no plans for a fiscal union with the understanding that a fiscal union is the all but inevitable conclusion of a common currency (the alternative is collapse). 
Likewise the goal of the EU from the beginning was ""an ever closer union"" (actual quote from the Treaty of Rome), but *Jean Monnet* knowing full well that the peoples of Europe (and French politicians) would never support federation, masterminded a strategy of spearheading economic integration, with political integration never presented up front, but simply as as a necessity brought by the economic integration.


Personally I think a *United States of Europe* is a good idea, but the way that it has been pushed despite public opposition in many countries is extremely undemocratic and I don't believe the end justifies the means. There is also a huge democratic deficit, which needs to be fixed before any more sovereignty is handed over (the true federalists have always been some of the strongest supporters of democratic reform to their credit). Finally increased centralization and regulations is not my cup of tea, whether it is on a national or European level.

It's for reasons such as this that I hate every criticism of British policy with regards to the EU being linked back to us somehow thinking the Empire still exists because I honestly don't see it in views of the British population.

A spectre of it could still be said to haunt the UK I suppose, but:

(1) We aren't the only nation to still have a monarch, and as much as I personally abhor the idea of the monarchy, it's not as though the rest of Europe lost their own monarchs peacefully. Portugal had a coup. Russia had a revolution. Germany lost WW1 etc. The fact is merely that history has not given us a significant enough incentive to get rid of them.

(2) It's hardly unsurprising that Britain wants to retain strong ties to the Anglosphere, and the Commonwealth and Special Relationship is part of that. Personally I'd rather Britain leans closer to Europe than the US, but wanting to retain strong ties with nations that we are historically (and culturally and linguistically) linked to can hardly be put down to idea of the Empire still existing.

(3) British military interference is perhaps the the thing I'd most link back to the Empire (and again it's not something I really care for) but France could equally be accused of this with their military involvement in Africa. 

I'd love British opinion on the EU to be more positive, but honestly I think pointing the finger back in history to blame the British Empire for the current relationship between Britain and the EU is lazy, incorrect, and completely unhelpful.

About tourism, I wouldn't even know where to begin. My favorite neighborhood here is called the ""Quartier Latin"". That's where Notre-Dame is and I'm lucky enough to go to university nearby.
