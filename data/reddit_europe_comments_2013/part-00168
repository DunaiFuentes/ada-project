The states of this federal Europe will always stay the countries that exist now (unless some of them decide to split up or something), changing this would be supported by almost no one.

Having said this, I think it is certainly a good thing (in some cases even necessary) that a common government would get more powers. We have a common currency, it is clear now that this should be accompanied by a common economic policy.

We use our armies only outside of the EU, it would be a lot cheaper and more effective if we had only one common army. A common European foreign policy will only be more effective. 

Immigration policy: illegal immigrants can almost freely travel within the EU, once they're in. This is a European problem, why don't we solve it together, instead of 28 different policies. 

Other things which have no particular reason to be centralised can obviously stay a responsibility of the member states, for example education.

In any case, my point was that being *openly* gay, or rather, the right to be openly gay is political in this part of the world. Russia has the whole ""decadent west"" narrative and other countries in its general sphere of influence (incl. mine) also see openness about sexuality as a threat to the safety of the nation.

Now, pardon me if I am overgeneralising, but in Canada (and north/western Europe), the political issue lies in ""Should we keep civil unions or merge it with marriage"" and ""should both same-sex parents adopt the kid or it should be treated as a single-parent adoption"". That's hardly the thing I was referring to. 

(Of course I wouldn't expect that you don't have more backwards communities that indeed see openly gay people as enemies of the nation (or even people who ""look somehow gay"", even if they aren't), but as you said, the law is in their side, and more people will be willing to help them -ie by associated with them).

---------------------

The S&amp;D is also Federalist.  Both Barroso and Martin Schulz, its leader up until 2012, ~~is~~ ~~also~~ are Federalist.  Richard Sulik destroyed Martin Schulz on German tv when he pointed out that the EU already was pushing for homogeneous debt consolidation and greater political integration against its own rules, specifically Article 125 of the functioning of Europe which states that each member state is responsible for its own debt.  Schulz tried to claim he represented all 754 MEPs on this and attacked Sulik for being an elected leader of a party!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OafqVVmVQHI

Mr Barroso might be more diplomatic when arguing for Federalism, that he's not pushing for federalism in the US sense.  Whilst he admits he sees it as empire building, he isn't quite telling the truth when he says it won't be forced.  Countries are forced into the Euro which makes it very difficult for them to move away from further political integration, the Troika certainly hands out punitive measures - it's only a common currency in name, when Cypriot Euros are restricted in their movement.  Meanwhile President Barroso is more than happy to use terrorist threats to pressurise countries to give up their veto.

**The federalist S&amp;D is the second largest voting bloc in the EU.**

Guy Verhofstadt Guy, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) is a huge proponent of Federalism.   Only last month he was arguing that if countries wanted to save money they should combine embassies and foreign policy.   Verhofstadt is one of the architects of the Spinelli Group that advocates post-national Federalism.

**The ALDE is the third largest voting bloc in the EU.**

-------------------------

**The Federalist EPP, S&amp;D, and ALDE, currently represent 554 MEPs or 72% of the vote.**  The problem is that people don't realise that the incredibly unpopular policy of federalism is so well represented by political parties willing to push their agendas onto people.

               constitutive treaties of the EU. Second, the 
               EU lacks a real 'tax and spend' capacity, in 
               other words, there is no fiscal federalism.""

Then it's not enough to dismiss federalism as a scare tactic, or that it means more of the same, it's a real and present danger.  Member states are already due to lose title of master of the treaties with the introduction of majority voting on the Council.  The second point of tax and spend we are seeing the arguments for now.  That's what collaterised debt to manage with the crisis is.  The two missing points of Federalism are now here and being forced through!  

http://pre.docdat.com/docs/index-124891.html?page=2#1357652

So when you say,

&gt;**As such, it won't happen, and can be dismissed as pretty much a scare tactic.**

The largest three voting blocs in the EU are all pro-federalist, and it's not a case of it won't happen, but a case that the PROCESS *is* happening.   

Whilst you're right it doesn't have a popular mandate across Europe, the European Commission and the three largest voting blocs don't seem to feel a need to be accountable to the public.  They're pushing on with the direction regardless.  The problem is that people don't know what their supposed representatives are pushing for when out of the country!

It's not a case that its unpopular and so it won't happen.   It's an argument that the democratic deficit has become so great in the European Parliament, so unaccountable, that they don't need it to be popular.

--------------

N.B.

Plea*se note, I'm not just claiming things, it is incredibly easy to source  everything from their own dispatch boxes.  Before dismissing it as either scare tactics or fantasy, note that I'm able to show not how it could happen, but how it is happening, and leaders of blocs themselves arguing that it should happen.*

------------------

When you say,  

&gt;**policy decided jointly**   

then they've already passed the voting reform that the council must vote unanimously and changed it to qualified majority voting (QMV) for almost all things.  This passed in 2009 and comes into effect in 2014.  Already at a European Council level national states are being disenfranchised.  They need 55% of states, with 65% of the EU population.  Suddenly the continued expansion of the EU eastwards despite their 'economic' disparity starts to make sense from a Federalist P.O.V., and we know that's happening despite all pragmatism saying that the EU should not be taking on more weaker states.

Parliamentary voting has long since been a quid-pro-quo affair where voting blocs liberally hand out rubber stamps, but *'policy decided jointly'*, as you put it, will mean a completely different thing from the start of 2014.  Then it will mean a majority of countries dictating to a very significant minority.

A good first step would be getting rid of the superfluous Länder and giving that money back to the communes. Also, shrink the federal budget - and give it back to the communes. No more playing military superhero at the Hindukush - but working streets at home.

In Canada, Multiculturalism is an official Canadian doctrine - not just something practiced. LGBT is a sub-culture, and so is, by law, an accepted part of accepting gay rights is what it is to be Canadian.

The link here can explain it further, but to sum it up, I can say comfortably that being gay is accepted politically.  Because something is accepted politically, does not mean that the debate over gay rights is over with.

As our Prime Minister said:  “We don’t imprison people for their expressing political positions. I think our position in this regard represents the position of Canadians and they expect that we speak in favour of these rights.”

So, LBGT rights is a political issue, but we are on the side of rights for gays, not against it.  In Russia it is also a political issue, but they are on the side against gays.

true,jugdemon,EURO,Living outside the union,"Ok, let's reformulate to make my position more clear:

First a single retailer would not be of interest. But a stream of retailers does tell a story. I suppose we could wait till all of them arrive and then make news of it, but it would take to long, the process would not be documented well and people far off the region would not take note until then whereas locals wouldn't take it as news as they arrived some time ago. That is, why I believe that a steady influx of business news is useful, even if the you have to piece the news together yourself.

Then again, maybe I am just too interested in economic development and this is generally ~~boring~~ not note-worthy.

Second to the devaluation. By no means my intention was to devalue the Baltic states. But I would argue that major international retailers need a certain purchasing power available before they would enter a market in order to avoid losses. Further I would perpetuate that they wish to reduce risk hence rather enter in a later stage than in an earlier one. So, if now more and more international retailers enter the Baltic states it implies that their is a greater confidence into the already existing market or the possibilities therein.

That is why I consider it note-worthy. From my experience in the Baltic states I would actually state the opposite, they are undervalued and the international retailers finally pouring in is a sign of correction.

I am looking forward to your perception of my case.

Not when that means mutual indebtedness, and means they need to take over fiscal policy.  

Guy Verhofstadt comes out and openly says a post-National Europe, so a system where there is no national sovereignty.  Martin Schulz comes out and doesn't say that but espouses that he represents all MEPs and that rules don't apply to the Commission.

So now that we've established that they very much are federalist, it's quite clear to see how this federalism is *being* formed (present tense), and it's not nice and it's certainly not representative.  

We have Rompuy of the EPP arguing that the EU can supercede UN rulings on Mali in favour of escalation, so we have a militant Federal Empire.  

We have Verhofstadt saying post-national federalism so we have an invasive Federal Empire. 

And we have Schulz assuming the authority to speak of others and being above the law, even attacking politicians for being elected leaders of small member states as opposed to his presidency (when really he's supposed to be nothing but a speaker and the electorate didn't choose him) so we have a distinctly authoritarian Federal Empire.

If Martin Schulz says Germany should assume other countries' debts, and Angela Merkel says no, the answer is no, because Angela Merkel, national politician, calls the shots.

This kind of argument relies on two things - first, 'cherry-picking', and second, paranoia. First you take scary-sounding comments, then you ignore that the people saying them have no power to make them happen, then you claim it's happening, and that you've proved it by referencing these statements.

Hidden underneath that is the assumption that these statements are merely the protruding tips of the secret forces that will bring about the thing in question, which is the paranoia.

About 25k students are from Slovakia, cca 7% of total. [*](http://is.muni.cz/do/econ/soubory/katedry/kres/4884317/41725568/14_2013.pdf) Czech and Slovak languages are mutually intelligible and Slovaks can use their language during exams.

I spend some time up in the Baltic states and I really enjoyed it. It hit me hardest when I was in the Occupation Museum in Riga. There was a tiny part of the exhibition dedicated to the time before the first Soviet Occupation and it was mind-blowing as to how developed the region was (culturally, socially and economically). I left it thinking if it hadn't been for the Soviets and Germans, the Baltic states would probably way more important in Europe right now. So positive economic news kind of point to the re-emergence. The Baltic states are having one of the best outlooks of the newer EU members and could be a leading example for others to follow, which in turn would fortify their position within the Union.

So yeah, be surprised, but a up till I'd say 1994, every Romanian would get bottled water in actual bottles... using the old bottles to get the filled up ones. Most shops wouldn't even sell you if you hadn't empty bottles (don't ask me how you got the first bottles...). Also, no plastic meant: you get your vegetables in a cotton bag... the same one for as long as it lasts you (usually more than one year). 

And talking about communism... there was no need for programmed obsolescence. I know people that still have perfectly working fridges that are 40 years old. Yeah, they don't make instant ice, but they keep the food cool.

My point is: when you point your finger at us for being behind on this stuff, don't forget we're a few laps in front of you. On the other hand, we're catching up (or down to keep the metaphor going) on the destruction of the environment... with a vengeance even: we're cutting down every tree around, we're polluting our waters, we're using plastic like it's the end of the world (it's basically the only thing that comes free in Romania so there's nobody refusing it) and recycling is considered as stupid, because nobody trusts the gov to process that crap anyways.

&gt;and the fact that what they're advocating is neither possible nor about to become so

You keep saying that but it is happening, now.  You might want to argue why it shouldn't be possible, why they should be held more accountable, but it doesn't change that it is the current position.  It shouldn't have been possible to pass an enabling law either, but they have.  

It shouldn't be possible to break the rules and sink prospering states into mutual indebtedness to push closer integration without having an open discussion about it, but they have.  Now they're saying we're all in this together and that we have no other choice.  When David Cameron asked for a real discussion about direction and reform he was given a resounding 'no dice' and told the EU is not 'à la carte'.

Shouldn't be possible, but it is.

&gt;This kind of argument relies on two things - first, 'cherry-picking', and second, paranoia.

I can't be accused of cherry picking when it is they that openly promote it as their own argument.  It could have been paranoia if it were 1992 going into Maastricht, it can't be paranoia once it's happened.  You don't get to say to Cyprus that still has the movement of its 'common' currency frozen that they're being paranoid about the troika.

You might have even got away with dismissing it as 'cherry picking' or 'paranoia' prior to the Lisbon Treaty, but when they don't let MEPs read it before voting, when they turn referendums, when it turns out its a way of implementing the failed Constitution, and when it is clearly an enabling bill, then accusations of cherry picking and paranoia only get you so far.

Io sono emigrato. Non penso di tornare per lavorare per codesti cazzoni; assumere un ingegnere per 'tirare bulloni' non mi sembra una buona strategia.

E voglio vedere fra qualche anno, quendo la dittarella - sempre meno competitiva per mancanza di innovazione - iniziera' a perdere pezzi. Per allora, gli ingegneri e i tecnici (quelli che non volevano 'tirare bulloni') saranno da un pezzo tutti in Germania, a lavorare per la concorrenza. E magari anche gli stranieri disperati ora assunti per un tozzo di pane si dirotteranno verso altri paesi, che offrono un po' piu' di opportunita'. 

Mi metto un bookmark sulla ditta 'Arredo Plast'; ci vediamo fra un paio d'anni, commendato'.

The language was first intended to be German because it was so close to Yiddish and yet adapted to all the demands of proper statehood. But after what all the horrendously tolerant nations did in the 40s Yiddish nearly ceased to exist and German fell slightly into disfavour. 

So did with the English language. Britain steadily kept strict quotas on Jew immigration turning whole ships stuffed with refugees back into gas chambers. The only nation that readily accepted Jewish refugees in WW2 was Argentina and it still has a sizable Jewish community. They also have adopted a plenty of nazis right after the war. *Perceived discrimination*'ll be the lowest over there.

I'm not cherry picking anything they say, they openly say it and promote it themselves.  If they openly admit that they are federalists, and that they're already here and in power, then you can do away with speculating what federalism might look like - you can just look at what they actually DO and have already DONE.

You're wanting to imagine what federalism will turn into, to say what is impossible further down the line.  I'm saying the federalists are already here (as are they) and saying that if you want to know what federalism in the future looks like look at their actions NOW.

Once we take them at their own word of what they are you can't say its cherry picking a sentence here and a sentence there, when looking at actual policy.  

It wasn't a slip of the tongue or one off goofs that saw referendums being overturned, constitutions rewritten into unreadable enabling treaties and passed without MEPs given the time to decipher it, quantitative majority voting being passed, or in the case of Article 125 unconstitutional spreading of debt under their own rules.  That's not cherry picking or paranoia.  It's fact as a matter of public record and existing, progressing policy.  Van Rumpuy didn't convene a meeting with the Presidents of the European Parliamentary Groups and then accidentally brain fart the entire meeting's agenda into a case about the EU setting the terms of war.  You can't freeze a country's currency and then claim no premeditation.  These are the actions of the self-identifying federalists.

It's cold light of day observable fact and process.  You don't have to extrapolate 5 or even 10 years into the future.  If you want to know what a federal Europe will mean you look at the federalist's of today and look at their actions.

&gt;Wallachian flag had big changes from a ruler to the other. Still, the most used color was a pale yellow. 

&gt;Transylvania was part of Hungarian Kingdom and later, of Austrian and Austro-Hungarian Empires. There was no place for a Romanian flag there. But Romanian noblemen living in Transylvania had all, with no exception, the light blue color on their heralds.

Sounds a bit like an explanation invented way after the adoption of the flag. The part about ""Romanian noblemen in Transylvania"" (what noblemen?) sounds like bullshit tbh, plus the fact that the colors were adopted way before Transylvania united with the Regat.

There was a similar myth that it's the merger of the Wallachian and Moldavian colors:

It isn't an interpretation on their part, it's merely a way for the President to act as a conduit between council and his position as impartial speaker to the house.  The President of every European political group also attends the meetings.  Don't make out that his view represents the voice of the MEPs as he did in the interview.  It's preposterous that you're even to develop this argument.   

Your second paragraph is even better...

So there's nothing in the rules of procedure except exactly what you quote that says as role of President he can only speak in a debate to sum up or call order, and that if a President does wish to speak their own mind then they may do so by standing down from the chair and not retaking it until after the debate  i.e. that they precisely restricted from entering a debate other than as themselves and not to confer representation under the title of President.   

You only went and quoted the exact legislation that states the office of President does not represent the voices of MEPs, and the chair must not be held whilst personal opinion is being expressed.  It's blatantly relevant to the broader point.  If he doesn't speak for MEPs when they're in the room, he sure as hell doesn't speak for them when they're not and he's just airing his own opinion!

I would have thought of all things it was patently obvious that Martin Schulz does not speak for the EFD and its president Mr Farage, or even marginally represents their views.

Perchè non valgono? Il concetto è lo stesso, il differenziale è lo stesso.

&gt;Certo che all'estero la vita è meglio, lì TUTTI - giovani e vecchi - sono interessati a a vivere in un paese che funziona, e ciò si ripercuote su ogni cosa - politica, industria e servizi. Non sono interessati a lasciare il proprio paese in cerca di lidi più verdi, vogliono essere orgogliosi di viverci dentro.

E' facile essere orgogliosi di vivere in un paese quando il tuo paese ti fa essere orgoglioso di viverci. L' Italia non è un paese - e credo che il problema di fondo sia quello. Ci sono più differenze culturali fra Sondio e Palermo che fra Barçelona e Oslo. Non è un problema? Come si può chiedere a uno che vive e lavora a Sondrio di pagare le tasse i Palernitani che, quantomeno come la si vede da fuori, sono 40 anni che buttano tutto in pasto alla ""mafia""? E forse la ""mafia"" non è semplicemente il loro governo? Perchè allora io devo pagare dei soldi a qualcuno che di fatto vive in un altro stato e non contribuisce in nessun modo al mio?

E' lo stesso motivo per il quale l' unione europea non funziona. Mettetevi nei panni di un tedesco che vive a Monaco ed è felice (più o meno) di pagare le tasse per aiutare chi vive in Germania Est... non è così felice di pagarle per chi vive in Italia. Perchè? Perchè un tedesco di Lipsia è comunque un tedesco - un italiano no. Perchè l' Italiano non ha niente in comune con me, non fa parte del mio stato e non fa parte della mia cultura, non parla la mia lingua, non ha le mie abitudini.

La questione nord sud la negano tutti da cent' anni ma è sempre lì, non è che va via se si rende *politically incorrect* il discuterne. 

&gt; Il problema è il cinismo che ha aggredito le nuove generazioni, che credono che in Italia tutto vada male e che all'estero la vita sia meglio. 

E' cinismo o è pragmatismo? Perchè uno a 30 anni che parla l' Inglese deve rimanere? Per pagare la pensione a chi prima ha preso tutto quello che poteva e poi ha detto ""adesso sono cazzi vostri c'è la crisi però nessuno mi tocchi la pensione che io altrimenti cosa faccio""? Tutto quello che era il sistema del lavoro dipendente a tempo indeterminato è stato pezzo per pezzo smontato nel silenzio di tutti i lavoratori dei tempi ai quali è stato detto ""non preoccupatevi, tanto non riguarda voi ma solo chi viene dopo"".

Ho parlato con tante persone dell' età del mio papà (50-60) che stanno per andare in pensione e dicono (testuali parole) ""ma uno come fa a vivere con 1600 euro al mese?"" e hanno casa con mutuo pagato e un bel gruzzolo da parte.

That's a pretty weak argument.. if they're working they can afford to feed themselves. Sure they'll make less than average wage but that should be enough to eat. Maybe they'll get social housing (which I'm guessing takes a while to get after applying, it's sometimes 1 year in France). 

So England will get a cheap labour force that will pay rent and will probably not get too much in terms of welfare. I don't understand what they're bitching about..

Lévy se sert de son aura ""droit de l'hommiste"" montée de toutes pièces pour abonder dans le sens de la propagande du gouvernement français; lequel affirmait intervenir en Libye dans le cadre d'une campagne limitée ne visant qu'à protéger les vies des rebelles partisans du Conseil national.

Dans les années 1970, Lévy était une des figures de proue des ""nouveaux philosophes"" groupe de jeunes intellectuels s'attaquant par la droite au marxisme et au Parti communiste français, en s'appuyant sur les questions de droits de l'homme, après la grève générale de mai-juin 1968.

Sympathisants du Parti socialiste, ces gens, y compris BHL, se sont rapidement orientés vers la droite dans le sillage de ce parti. Ils sont devenues riches et célèbres, plusieurs d'entre eux quittant finalement le PS pour soutenir Nicolas Sarkozy lors de la présidentielle de 2007.

BHL, somme toutes, est le parfait représentant de l'idéologie de divers étudiants et fils de la bourgeoisie mécontents et en rébellion dans la période post-1968, ces forces devenant elles-mêmes aisées ou – dans le cas de Lévy – immensément riches.

Furthermore unlike in Ireland where a lot of houses have been built by investors that now are abandoned, you won't find any such houses in Germany.

You also have to take into account that unlike a lot of other countries most people in Germany don't own a house, especially not if they live in a city. Rent prices are much more interesting to look at. Admittedly they to are rising but that can be expected with the major gentrification problems all larger cities have.

This boom is not at all comparable to Ireland, where a lot of houses were built by investors purely on speculation, most of which are now abandoned.

- essere il capostipite o un punto di svolta (o anche un punto d riferimento) di un genere letterario
- riuscire a riassumere al suo interno la visione del mondo del periodo e i sentimenti verso il futuro/passato

In queste due categorie rientrano i principali scritti di Verne, Asimov, Heinlein per la fantascienza; Lovercraft, Poe e King per l'horror (es IT, misery, Carry) e rientrano anche i classici non di genere come i grandi romanzi russi (guerra e pace, i karamazov, resurrezione, idiota, anna karenina) ecc. ecc.

Personalmente ritengo che queste due categorie funzionino per scremare l'immondizia come ""Il codice da Vinci"", ""50 sfumature di *noia*"", gli ultimi lavori di King -scritti solo per vendere-, praticamente tutti gli harmony, twilight ecc. ecc., che sono libri piacevoli da leggere (secondo i gusti) ma che non arricchiscono la mente/spirito/chelchelé o  ""la letteratura""e che sarebbe meglio trovare a 0.99 e non a 18.90.

true,torriethecat,NETH,The Netherlands,"I'll try to explain why the housing bubble in the Netherlands is bigger than in other EU countries.

There are few main reasons:

1. Government subsidies on buying a house.

2. Scarce of building ground/houses.

3. A LOT of rules.

4. Taxes.

For the first bit, we go back 25 years to the 80s. Problem #2 did exists back than too. So young people had problems with affording a new house, because they where scarce, and thus, expensive. Instead of solving this by making it possible to build more cheaper houses, they made mortgage-interests tax-deductible. This made it possible for more people to buy a house. 

Anyone who paid attention in economics class, understands that problem #2, the shortage of houses, increased. So did the prices.
Cities made use of this by increasing building-ground prices as well.

To make it worse, banks had found a 'hack', the [Endowment mortgage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_mortgage), wich made you pay interest for 30 years, so there was more tax deduction, and cheaper total price.

Late 90s and early 2000s, the third problem came. We had 'the purple cabinet' that had made a hobby of rule making. Rules on isolation and other energy-saving are strict. This makes building new houses more expensive.

Besides this, there was also problem #4: Taxes. Every time a house was sold, you had to pay 6% tax. So every seller had to sell at a 6% higher price than he bought to not sell at a loss. This increased prices. They decreased this rate last year to 2%. 

Now in 2010s the situation has changed. Government, banks, and people are more careful with its money.
The tax deduction rules are changed, as they were to expensive for the government. The [Endowment mortgage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_mortgage) (Where you got tax-decution for 30 years) is not tax-deductible anymore. Also, banks are not so happy anymore to lend money.

And with extra people losing their jobs, it is extra hard to sell your house. But the prices are still higher than the prices in the west of Germany. So I think the prices will go down further.

Mentre in forte aumento (+25,8%) risultano quelli compiuti dalla criminalità comune (122). Seguono quelli da criminalità organizzata (84). Tra i 419 autori noti di omicidio volontario censiti nel 2012, il 91,4% è un uomo e l'8,6% donna. Nel contesto familiare e affettivo la vittima è principalmente donna (61,1%), di età compresa tra i 25 e i 54 anni. Mentre il killer in oltre 9 casi su 10 è un uomo. Gli omicidi 'nella coppia' interessano quasi la metà delle vittime totali di uccisioni in famiglia. 81 FEMMINICIDI NEI PRIMI SEI MESI DELL'ANNO - Nei primi sei mesi del 2013 sono state uccise **81 donne**, di cui il **75% nel contesto familiare o affettivo**.

Quindi 175 omicidi in ambito familiare. 61 delle vittime erano donne (75/100\*81). 61 / 175 \* 100 = 34,85%. Quindi un terzo, giusto? Ma nel paragrafo citato si trova questa frase: **""nel contesto familiare e affettivo la vittima è principalmente donna (61,1%)""**.

Demnach könnte ich ja auch einfach so definieren, daß Kleinschreibung richtig ist, ohne den Sinn zu beachten.
  
Worin liegt denn der Sinn, den Sinn nicht zu beachten?
  
Gut, mal ein anderes Beispiel:

Gehen wir mal weg von den häufig gebrauchten Wörtern wie ""etwas Schönes"" oder ""etwas Besonderes"".
  
Ein Beispiel:
  
""Karl hat aus Brettern ein Holzgestell gebaut. Es ist nicht klar zu erkennen, was es sein soll, aber es hat etwas **t**ischartiges an sich.""
  
Soll man hier wirklich schreiben:
  
""Karl hat aus Brettern ein Holzgestell gebaut. Es ist nicht klar zu erkennen, was es sein soll, aber es hat etwas **T**ischartiges an sich."" ?
  
Das paßt einfach nicht.
  
**Edit**:
  
Zur Verdeutlichung: Wenn ich also sage, das Holzgestell hat etwas ""**T**ischartiges an sich"", dann heißt das nichts anderes, als daß ein ""Tischartiges"" -also ein physisches Objekt- an dem Holzgestell lehnt, klebt oder was auch immer. Wir haben also zwei Objekte: Das Holzgestell und das Tischartige.
  
Aber das ist ja nicht die Bedeutung, nicht der Sinn des Satzes. Die Bedeutung, also der Sinn des Satzes liegt darin, daß das Holzgestell einem Tisch ähnlich ist, also tischartig aussieht.
  
**Edit2**:

&gt; Grammatikalisch sehe ich einfach keinen Unterschied zwischen ""dem Schönen"" und ""dem Schönen an etwas"".

Ja, da hast du recht. Nur spielt eben die Semantik auch eine Rolle. Andernfalls könnte ich ja alles groß- oder kleinschreiben, wie ich will, solange der Satzbau stimmt.",0,1376577031,null,0,1376580764,0,cbo9zas,t3_1jyxql,t1_cbo9zas,t1_cbo9dlg,null,1429820569,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

If you cannot fix your mortgage interest rate for a set amount of time, you *have* to be prepared for an increase. That's just common sense.

Today the spreads are higher yet the indexing is lower. Don't you see that no matter how, we loose? Banks have too much power! And they behave in a cartel. And before white knighting for them, know that they hamper legislation on leases, youth subsidization and are involved in price fixing, urban taxation by government and even property prices/appraisals (estimations of property's worth). 

This sounds like a bus stop talk but it's actually true. Banks put themselves in win win situations and their goal is to expand their wealth, even if it means screwing people over or corrupting officials. Just because it correlates with demagoguery at the moment doesn't mean it's not true.

Hell, they even get away with mass bailouts, which is taxpayer money, that will never be paid back.

Never happened at all?  Clumsily evolving?

-------------------------

         'Referendums being overturned'

Not only when the constitution was rejected in two referendums did they go away and rewrite the same thing as a enabling treaty, or reform treaty, as a means to circumvent referendums.  When the Irish then turned it down, they were told to go away and vote again until they came to a different conclusion whilst the No vote was deterred from investing more money in the campaign as the Yes campaign was doubled down from money overseas.

They treated democracy and accountability as obstacles to be gotten over or around.

-----------------------------------

        'constitutions rewritten into unreadable enabling treaties'

We have quite a few who have spilled the beans on this.  No more so than the Trade Commissioner Karel de Gucht (ALDE) 

*""The aim of the Constitutional treaty was to be more readable; the aim of this treaty is to be unreadable...The Constitution aimed to be clear, whereas this treaty had to be unclear. It is a success.""*

Now, I know you like to dismiss confessions or proclamations as cherry picking when it doesn't coincide with your world view such as it is, so fortunately there's this too...

As others have pointed out, banking practices vary across the EU. In some countries, like Germany, fixed-rate mortgages are he norm, whereas in others, it is more common to offer mortgages in which the interest rate is adjusted yearly, tracking such indices as Libor or Euribor (which we now know to have been fixed).

The crassest were possibly the Spanish banks, which almost exclusively offered adjustable-rate mortgages pegged to the Euribor index, but smuggled clauses in the fine print setting interest rate floors, meaning that, in practice, interest rates could only be adjusted in one direction: upwards. Such unfair clauses have now been condemned by the European Court of Justice, but the Spanish government has already made it clear that the banks won't have to pay back their customers.

What will happen?

* The police arrests Di Rupo, resulting in a huge diplomatic scandal. All western leaders will support Di Rupo and say Poetin is a big douchebag. Eventually, Poetin will set Di Rupo free. 

* The police wont arrest Di Rupo. Russian authoritied will look powerless.

* A Russian group of weirdo's kill/attack Di Rupo. That would be sad, but yet again, Poetin will be humiliated.

Thing about a family. This huge family of 20 or 30 people is all in a room at once. Everyone in this room looks kind of similar. But there is no one identifiable feature.

Maybe a few more have a little finger which is far smaller than a little finger should be compared to the rest of their fingers. 

They are all easily identifiably part of the same family. But there is no one, unique, solid and definable feature which every family member has. But there is a continuum.

There's a reason why horse jockeys are generally very small and short people. Every pound counts.

A war horse is going to be carrying a large, muscular, heavily armed and armored man. The horse itself may also have armor. War horses are bred for strength and stamina, not speed. A well trained war horse is itself a weapon, and in some cases could even fight along with its rider. A kick by a horse or being trampled by a horse is going to do a lot of damage to someone on foot.

Charge speeds might be more around 30mph or even slower. Formation was extremely important, and you don't keep formation by having every horse riding at its individual maximum speed.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"No, this is just repetition at this stage. You're not talking about the ""actual actions of federalists"" but about the interpretations you ascribe to certain events, some of which represent the opposite of what you believe them to.

For example, the Constitution was an explicitly federal document - a constitution for the EU. It did not create a federal Europe, but the idea of a constitution was very much a federal idea.

That was rejected, and one of the reasons it was rejected was that it was a step too far in the federal direction. Lisbon was not the same thing, even though it contained pretty much the same content. It wasn't a constitution but simply a standard amending treaty, which the governments of Europe felt would be more palatable to their legislatures and/or citizens. 

You seem to believe that the only difference was the name, and that thus Lisbon sneaked through the contents of the Constitution, when it was the contents that were the problem. But the contents weren't the problem  - the majority of objections to Lisbon's content were fabricated complaints based on a rejection of any further integration, and it's very difficult to think of a genuine complaint about the contents that motivated more than a tiny minority. 

The problem was the federalist intent behind the Constitution's form, not its content, while the reason why it was put to referendum in several countries which didn't then hold referendums for Lisbon was purely PR. Even so, more people in the EU voted for it than against it.

That's why federalists were unhappy with Lisbon - because it represented a step back from the explicit federalism of the Constitution. Lisbon didn't, therefore, represent sneaking federalism in when it couldn't be got in through the Constitution, but the opposite - the abandonment of a federalist constitutional document in favour of a standard intergovernmental amending treaty.

And still your argument is simply that, to you, any integration = federalism, and any federalism = the bad kind of federalism you conceive of. And you still haven't even begun to make a case for that except in your own head. And yes, the ""there's premeditation in all"" is paranoia - *obviously* these things get thought about and discussed beforehand, there's nothing sinister in that, I'm afraid.

To reiterate my basic point here - yes, there are federalists (although not very many), yes, a fraction of those federalists want the kind of federal Europe you described originally. But they're not going to get it, because they're a very small number, and even those in influential positions are still vastly outnumbered and outgunned by those in equally or more influential positions who *don't* want that kind of federal Europe. You're opposing integration on the basis of it leading to somewhere it has a very miniscule chance of it going, and claiming every single integrative step is necessarily a step on the road to that exact destination. That's rubbish, I'm glad to say, and will continue to be rubbish no matter how much of this page you fill with quotes and your personal interpretations of events that demonstrate nothing except that you equate *any* integration with the creation of a nation-state-dissolving federal USE.",0,1376583752,null,0,1376584203,0,cboci2n,t3_1kcxc9,t1_cboci2n,t1_cboaxi5,null,1429819360,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Quelles sont les intentions de BHL ? Voyons ce qu'il dit lui même, et voyons ce qui s'est fait, ce qui s'est déroulé.

Le 24 mars 2011, Bernard-Henri Lévy a accordé un entretien par chat au site Web du Monde, défendant la guerre d'agression lancée par les États-Unis, la Grande-Bretagne et la France contre la Libye.

L'entretien accordé au Monde – intitulé ""[BHL : Le Conseil national de transition veut une Libye laïque](http://www.lemonde.fr/libye/chat/2011/03/24/libye-la-france-a-t-elle-deux-ministres-des-affaires-etrangeres_1497729_1496980.html)"" s'ouvrait par une question sur les raisons de l'intérêt de Lévy pour le dossier libyen et de son organisation de la rencontre entre le Conseil national et Sarkozy. Lévy a répondu : "" Ce n'est pas un dossier. C'est Benghazi. [...] J'ai été bouleversé. J'ai fait ce que j'ai pu.""

Après d'autres questions sur son rôle, il avait déclaré : ""Aucun rôle. Sinon celui d'avoir eut, un soir, à Benghazi, l'idée folle de décrocher mon téléphone pour appeler le président de la République de mon pays et lui suggérer de recevoir une délégation de la Libye libre."" Puis il a nié être impliqué d'aucune façon dans le ""volet politique,"" disant ""Bien sûr que non. Je suis comme vous. J'observe avec anxiété le déroulement des choses."" Ce commentaire absurde soulève bien plus de questions qu'il n'en résout. Il est évident que Lévy n'est pas, comme il le dit, un citoyen ordinaire inquiet des développements en Libye. On est tenté de demander : comment Lévy s'est-il rendu à Benghazi, en pleine guerre civile, et été en contact téléphonique direct avec Sarkozy ? La posture adoptée par Lévy – dire que son soutien à l'attaque française contre la Libye et pour le Conseil national s'appuie sur un souci désintéressé pour le sauvetage des vies humaines – est une fraude monstrueuse. (tu suis ma propagande staliniste jusque là ?)

 
En fait, on peut difficilement considérer que Lévy soit opposé au meurtre des lybiens, comme il le dit lui-même. Quand on lui demande s'il est favorable à la limitation des opérations au maintien d'une zone d'interdiction aérienne en Libye, il répond : ""Il faut aller au-delà de la ""no fly zone"". C'est-à-dire aller jusqu'aux frappes ciblées contre les armements lourds de Kadhafi. C'est regrettable. C'est horrible, l'idée même d'une frappe ciblée. Mais, si l'on veut vraiment protéger les civils de Misrata, Syrte et Benghazi, il n'y a plus d'autre solution.""


Lévy avait par la suite tenté d'adopter une posture plus humanitaire, affirmant : ""Une chose importante déjà : ce sont des musulmans laïques. La Libye qu'ils projettent sera une Libye où la religion sera affaire de conscience."" C'est une manœuvre évasive malhonnête. L'"" idée de la paix"" que se fait Lévy implique des attaques massives et mortelles contre les soldats et civils libyens, durant la campagne que les puissances occidentales ont déchaînée contre les unités armées de la Libye et contre Tripoli. Lévy considère cependant que ces morts sont politiquement préférables aux morts qui pourraient se produire à Benghazi, si les forces de Kadhafi reprenaient la ville.

 

Lévy n'a jamais expliqué les raisons de classe qui sous-tendent ses calculs. Il avait préféré affirmer sans le démontrer qu'il soutient le Conseil national parce qu'il serait plus démocratique que Kadhafi. Ainsi, il disait : "" Le gouvernement qui remplacera la dictature actuelle sera issu d'élections libres. Et probablement transparentes. ""

Comme tous les autres propagandistes pro-impérialistes du Conseil national, Lévy est totalement silencieux sur la composition de ce Conseil national, affirmant platement qu'il va "" probablement "" apporter un régime démocratique. En fait, il n'y a aucune raison de croire que c'est inévitable, ou même probable. Il est bien connu maintenant que le Conseil national (CNT) est une coalition lâche de divers officiels du régime de Kadhafi, de groupes islamistes, de chefs tribaux, et d'activistes des droits de l'homme issus des classes moyennes, qui sont en contact étroit avec les gouvernements occidentaux de droite par l'entremise de gens comme Lévy.

Par exemple, quand un intervenant a demandé à Lévy : ""On n'évoque jamais la composante ""tribale"" ou la rivalité historique entre Est et Ouest en Libye. Après votre voyage auprès des forces révolutionnaires, n'avez-vous pas intégré cela dans votre analyse de la situation ? "" Lévy a répondu : "" Non. Peut-être parce que je n'ai pas eu l'occasion d'étudier cela d'assez près. Mais aussi parce que les représentants du CNT eux-mêmes disent et répètent que cette ""composante tribale"" compte aussi peu que possible dans leur propre analyse. ""

 
Lévy veut que ses lecteurs croient qu'il s'est rendu à Benghazi en ignorant qui il allait rencontrer et qu'il n'a toujours pas eu "" l'occasion d'étudier cela d'assez près. "" Ce n'est pas plus crédible que les autres assertions de Lévy. Mais quelques citations du Monde – un quotidien que Lévy connaît bien puisqu'il siègait à l'époque à son comité de surveillance – aideront à clarifier la question du Conseil national.
 

Luis Martinez, du Centre de recherches et d'études internationales (CERI) de Science-Po Paris, a déclaré au Monde : "" Il y a trois groupes parmi les contestataires : les islamistes, les défenseurs des droits de l'homme, et les plus nombreux : les jeunes. "" Bien que Martinez ne l'ait pas mentionné, il est bien connu que la direction du Conseil national est en réalité recrutée parmi les responsables du régime de Kadhafi qui ont récemment retourné leur veste. Parmi eux : l'ex-ministre de la justice Mustafa Abdul Jalil et le Général Abdel Fattah Younis al Obaidi, commandant d'une unité des forces spéciales libyennes.

Les forces islamistes qui participent au Conseil national comprennent le Parti Ouma et le Groupe de combat islamique, d'après le chercheur suisse Hasni Abidi. Ces forces sont ouvertement favorables à un état théocratique.

François Dumasy, de l'Institut des études politiques d'Aix-en-Provence, avait expliqué qu'il y a des jeunes qui suivent le Conseil national, et qui sont ""inquiets de la libéralisation de l'économie et de la montée du chômage connue ces dernières années."" Cependant, il n'y a aucune ""vision commune"" entre les diverses composantes du Conseil national, Dumasy a expliqué qu'il n'y a ""aucune ""vision commune"" [...] Ils n'en sont pas là. Leur seul véritable dénominateur commun est de vouloir la fin du régime. Il faut bien imaginer que pendant les 42 années de règne de Kadhafi, l'expression politique a été réduite au minimum.""

En effet, Le Monde laisse entendre que le Conseil national ne jouit que d'un soutien populaire très limité. Rémy Ourdan, correspondant local du Monde, remarque : ""on ne sent pas parmi la population un enthousiasme phénoménal vis-à-vis du Conseil national de transition.""


Le Monde ajoute : ""La difficulté d'identifier clairement ses membres, et [le fait] que son président et son porte-parole ont occupé des responsabilités au sein du régime de Kadhafi ne jouent certainement pas en faveur de ce ""gouvernement parallèle"", reconnu comme interlocuteur légitime par Nicolas Sarkozy au début du mois de mars.""

Les allégations de Lévy selon lesquelles le Conseil national sera favorable à un régime démocratique ou laïc sont des mensonges. C'est une coalition instable d'éléments des classes moyennes et dirigeantes, qui ont réagi à une radicalisation des masses nord-africaines en établissant une alliance militaire avec l'impérialisme occidental. Ils dépendent des grandes puissances pour leur soutien militaire. Quand ils sont arrivé au pouvoir, ils ont négocié dans l'urgence la vente des réserves pétrolières libyennes et donné à l'occident un régime de droite qui lui sert de base pour lancer les opérations suivantes en Afrique du Nord.

Lisbon was not the same thing, even though it contained pretty much the same content. It wasn't a constitution but simply a standard amending treaty, which the governments of Europe felt would be more palatable to their legislatures and/or citizens.

Ostrich.

Lisbon held all the same competences as the constitution.  The only superficial things that were dropped were the likes of the flag and anthem.  

The federalists themselves, some the very authors, openly admit it to be the same thing.

&gt;The problem was the federalist intent behind the Constitution's form, not its content, 

The problem is how the federalists about it went about it!  That's why I don't have to talk about projections or impossibilities.  It's how they went about forcing their policies through - public be damned.  

That's the window into the soul of federalism of europe.

&gt;And still your argument is simply that, to you, any integration = federalism, and any federalism = the bad kind of federalism you conceive of.

That's clearly absurd and not what I've said anywhere.  I've argued that federalists are already running the show, and their federalism, and how they are going about it, and the levels to which they're willing to stoop, is what makes it bad.

As Hanne Dahl MEP for Denmark said in the Parliament on the riding roughshod of democracy and representation over Lisbon:

               ""The Commission says that ratification should proceed regardless, that the scepticism
                of one country should not  stop the development of Europe - and that the Irish people
                have a problem.  This is not the case.  There is not a chasm between the people of
                Ireland and Europe!  The chasm is between the people of Europe and the European 
                leaders.  There is no chasm between some countries and the rest of Europe - France,  
                Holland and Ireland don't want to stop development.  They want a different development.
                Try and get that!""

I'm not talking about fanciful directions of federalism in the future and arguing only a bad one form can come about.  I'm arguing that the federalists of today, in power, only have one direction in mind and they're deeply anti-democratic and strictly authoritarian in forwarding it.

This is 2004, Portugal. A and M are graduated out of college and found work (the highly skilled kind) in a big city or the capital (obviously). Looking around places to rent or buy. They find property prices extremely high in rent and are only accessible in mortgage mode. The ones that imply you wedd yourself and all insurances, salary payments, bills, etc., to a bank account. These places outnumber the rent available places like 5 to 1, due to a construction boom. Now, the same bank that brokers your mortgage and allowed you to afford living anywhere near those jobs guarantees the only reasonable solution for that moment. 

Now, A and M are not stupid. They don't want to jump in, but there are no alternatives! They both want a family and a one bedroom overpriced ""no control"" rent apartment with no garage is not family friendly and is barely affordable nor will it ever belong to them or is a safe investment because the law is shit and they can get evicted by numerous technicalities, not to mention most of these leases are fraught with illegalities/irregularities and no safety. City hall are so thickly corrupted by landlords that this kind of thing gets away with impunity. So, they have no choice. They sign up their mortgages.

Technically, in Germany when a game is banned it is forbidden to be sold to minors and also forbidden to be advertised. However, that advertising ban also includes placement on store shelves, meaning they have to be sold under the counter after checking ID. Thing is, with these kind of regulations what usually happens is that none of the stores want to stock the game anymore since it is highly doubtful that they can sell their stock. 

Hence, while the law only bans sale to minors and ads, in practice the bans affect everyone.

And you know this how? This seems to be a common idea in Germany, which has proportional representation instead of a first-past-the-post system.

But, this area is traditionnally very popular (by popular I mean poor) and traditionnaly crappy and most of people from the crappy time are mostly the ones that still live there (with the old cheap loans) that makes that this is still globally crappy.

So ok there are some cool places but just for a view, an evening, not for a living.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt;...Donald Tusk, re-elected in 2011, has made modernising the armed forces a priority. This year’s defence budget of $9.5 billion has grown by 7% over 2012, bringing Poland close to the 2%-of-GDP target that all NATO members are supposed to meet, but very few do.
 
&gt;The defence minister, Tomasz Siemoniak, has announced that $43 billion is earmarked for military procurement to replace outdated weaponry, much of which hails from the Soviet era, over the next ten years. The share of the defence budget going on equipment will rise from 15% to 33%. On Mr Siemoniak’s shopping list is a missile-defence system, new ships for the navy, upgraded tanks, military training aircraft, 70 helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and better equipment for ground troops. This is part of a military overhaul that began with the end of conscription in 2009. The new all-volunteer army of about 65,000 active personnel, supported by a much larger part-time reserve, is nimbler and more deployable than its lumbering predecessor. That is crucial for the expeditionary missions that have preoccupied NATO since the cold war.

Maybe the polandball stereotypes need to be revisited. It looks like Poland is rather serious about bulking up.

&gt;A clear political purpose lies behind this. Out of loyalty to America, Poland joined George W. Bush’s “coalition of the willing”, sending a brigade to fight in Iraq. It dispatched a 2,600-strong contingent to the tough eastern province of Ghazni in Afghanistan, where almost 40 Polish soldiers have died. **Increasingly, Poland seeks influence within NATO that reflects its size and new prosperity.** Having modern armed forces that can be sent into action when a crisis hits gets you a place at the decision-making table, especially when other countries are slashing defence budgets.

It looks like Poland is hitching its economic cart to Germany, and its military cart to the US. I wonder if in a few years Poland can be more than a bit player, and be a power in Europe in its own right. That would certainly be an interesting development.

&gt;**Another theme of Polish security policy is the need for NATO to move away from intervention in far-flung lands towards a renewed emphasis on territorial defence and a commitment to Article 5 (which treats an attack on one NATO member as an attack on all).** Poland sat out the Libyan campaign in 2011, believing it to be an unnecessary diversion from NATO’s core purpose. Mr Sikorski notes Russia’s rapidly growing defence budget—this year it will rise by more than a quarter—and the belligerent tone that Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin uses towards the West. He calls Poland’s relations with Russia “pragmatic but brittle” and, after the war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, he sees conflict in Europe as only too “imaginable”.

I would like to see NATO re-focus on its initial task. That is, the defense of mainland Europe. It doesn't do NATO's reputation any good when its deployed in Middle Eastern countries that pose no threat to the West. This would be especially timely as the Russians seem to be flexing its muscles as well, and becoming increasingly aggressive.
 
&gt;Poland and other NATO “border countries” were concerned about the Russian-Belarusian Zapad and Ladoga military exercises in 2009, which simulated attacks on the Baltic states and Poland. They also point to the increased activity of Russian bombers close to the airspace of NATO members and the threats from Moscow of preventive attacks on parts of the European missile-defence system that America is deploying in stages.

Any Poles care to weigh in on this? Do you think the time is right for Poland to assert itself with a little more confidence? How do you feel about Poland potentially becoming a major player in Europe? I for one think all of these developments are very encouraging.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;You know what happened to all those awesome people from 2011? They left and they started a new subreddit. They didn't leave because of ""fascist moderation"". They left because of rampant racism and because they felt their well thought out comments were drowned out by stupid xenophobes and trolls.
&gt;
&gt;So they went out and set up /r/europeans, which is an even more heavily moderated subreddit.

Oh, r/europeans, the shitty subreddit nobody cares to visit, where nothing is discussed [or allowed](http://www.reddit.com/r/europeans/comments/1cocha/today_in_europe_april_19/c9imnsz).

Lol, that's where r/europe is headed, in attempting to moderate, all worthwhile discussion ceases to exist, you hardly even get 10 comments per page.

By contrast, r/portugal is completely unmoderated, I don't think anyone was ever banned, and it works perfectly, no hassle, no problems, always something to discuss in the comments.. the community moderates itself through upvotes and downvotes and I think the mod there doesn't even have to deal with spammers as the community itself easily downvotes them.

&gt;You'll recognise a lot of names in their „Why this subreddit is needed”-thread. Also, you might wanna check out the names in this and this thread. I'd love to see all those people back on /r/europe.

I do, too bad that project was doomed to fail, if you want proper discussion, you must not stamp out different opinions, otherwise you'll just end up with a circlejerk.

&gt;But if you think less moderation will do the trick, you're clearly deluding yourself.

It's what kept this subreddit healthy back in the day, it's what still today makes r/portugal a community where you can discuss anything without being banned.

""Karl hat aus Brettern ein Holzgestell gebaut. Es ist nicht klar zu erkennen, was es sein soll, aber es hat etwas Tischartiges an sich."" 

Na klar. Ich sehe keinen Grund wieso nicht. 

&gt;  Wenn ich also sage, das Holzgestell hat etwas ""Tischartiges an sich"", dann heißt das nichts anderes, als daß ein ""Tischartiges"" -also ein physisches Objekt- an dem Holzgestell lehnt, klebt oder was auch immer. Wir haben also zwei Objekte: Das Holzgestell und das Tischartige.

Das sehe ich aber anders. Wenn jemand ""zur Vernunft kommt"" heißt das ja auch nicht, dass jemand zu einem Gegenstand namens Vernunft hingeht, und wenn jemand ""die Verantwortung trägt"", dann hat er auch kein komisches Kleidungsstück namens Verantwortung.

Ein Substantiv wird doch nicht nur dann groß geschrieben, wenn es etwas Gegenständliches bezeichnet. Das ist einfach Blödsinn.

They are. German polititians who think they're still living in the 80's aren't. Problem is German gamers aren't doing anything about this (eg. protesting, petitions, writing polititians), so it doesn't look like anything is going to change any time soon.

As to why they don't, I can only speculate. Maybe it's because gamers are afraid to be perceived as basement dwelling nerds, a derogatory term german polititians are just too happy to fling around whenever the opportunity presents itself. Maybe it's because the gamer demographic (age &lt;35) in general, for whatever cultural reason, is very uninvolved with politics. In every German protest you see in the news the crowd is largely made up out of &gt;40 year olds, usually protesting job cuts or pensions and such. The only time I can remember younger people protesting was when they introduced student tuition fees. If that demographic doesn't voice its opinion in any matter, I doubt they will when it comes to this. 

&gt; I heard the new Xbox console is going to be region locked. Does that pretty much guarantee that Germans are going to be totally screwed then?

Not much more than they are now, really. Before HD there were legitimate technical reasons why a movie from a different region wouldn't play on your TV, since it had a different resolution and framerate. With the introduction of HD however now both the hardware as well as the formats are standardized worldwise, so now the only thing that prevents global compatibility is a little bit of [code that says no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=AJQ3TM-p2QI&amp;t=47) for some BS economical reason. All the European countries are considered the same region (PAL), so you can still import games there. US games however won't work.

Which is why stories about foreigners getting completely drunk from a few glasses of beer seem unbelievable. We need to work on our alcohol culture.

true,quadrion,null,null,"&gt; Das sehe ich aber anders. Wenn jemand ""zur Vernunft kommt"" heißt das ja auch nicht, dass jemand zu einem Gegenstand namens Vernunft hingeht, und wenn jemand ""die Verantwortung trägt"", dann hat er auch kein komisches Kleidungsstück namens Verantwortung.

&gt; Ein Substantiv wird doch nicht nur dann groß geschrieben, wenn es etwas Gegenständliches bezeichnet. Das ist einfach Blödsinn. 

Da hast du natürlich recht! Den Begriff ""physisch"" hätte ich besser weglassen sollen, da habe ich wohl etwas überargumentiert.
  
Ein Substantiv wird jedoch groß geschrieben, weil es etwas **konkretes** bezeichnet.
  
Und damit komme ich - der Kreis schließt sich - auf die weiter oben mit Stygeros geführte Diskussion zurück:
Substantive beschreiben etwas konkretes... ""der Tisch"", ""der Stuhl"" usw. Sogar ""die Schönheit"" und ""die Vernunft"" sind eine konkrete Bezeichnung, auch wenn sie natürlich kein Gegenstand sind.
  
""Sie ist eine Schönheit""; das ist eine konkrete Aussage. Natürlich kannst du jetzt sagen: ""Nein, ist sie nicht."", was aber ebenfalls eine konkrete Aussage ist. Entweder sie ist es oder eben nicht, ja oder nein. Oder binär ausgedrückt: 1 oder 0... also konkret.

Wenn du aber sagst ""Sie hat etwas schönes an sich."", dann ist ""schönes"" eben keine konkrete Aussage, sondern eine schwammige, **abstrakte** Aussage, zu 50% schön, zu 70%, zu 90%, oder wieviel auch immer; es ist nicht festgelegt, nichts konkretes.
  
  
Aber um dein Beispiel aufzugreifen:
 
 ""Erika trägt die Verantwortung.""... Das Wort ""Verantwortung"" beschreibt doch ""Erika"" nicht, weist ihr doch keine Eigenschaft zu. Dieser Satz sagt doch lediglich aus, daß sie die Verantwortung hat. Kannst du auf die Frage ""**Wie** ist Erika?"" mit ""Sie ist Verantwortung."" antworten? Nein, natürlich nicht. Dazu bedarf eines Adjektivs. Also: ""**Wie** ist Erika?"" - ""Sie ist verantwortlich.""
  
""Verantwortlich"" weist ""Erika"" eine Eigenschaft zu, nicht ""Verantwortung"", während bei ""etwas schönes"" das ""schönes"" dem ""etwas"" definitiv eine Eigenschaft zuweist - das ist der Unterschied.
  
Darüber hinaus bitte ich noch folgenden Aspekt zu beachten:
  
- ""Ich esse etwas Schokolade.""
  
Dieser Satz sagt aus, daß ich eine gewisse Menge Schokolade esse.
  
- ""Ich esse etwas schokoladiges.""
  
Hier hat sogar das ""etwas"" eine andere Bedeutung, eine andere Funktion. Dieser Satz sagt nicht wie im ersten Beispiel aus, daß ich eine bestimmte Menge von ""schokoladiges"" esse, sondern daß ich überhaupt etwas schokoladiges esse - und genau so ist dieser Satz ja auch gemeint.

Würdest du hier ""Ich esse etwas Schokoladiges."" schreiben, dann würde dies bedeuten, du ißt etwas - also eine bestimmte Menge - von ""Schokoladiges"", was aber eben der Bedeutung des Satzes nicht entspricht.
    
Ich hoffe, ich habe es verständlich genug ausgedrückt.
  
Mir dröhnt der Kopf. :D

**Edit:**
  
&gt; Kannst du ja, es ist nach **aktueller**, deutscher Rechtschreibung dann aber eben falsch.
  
fyp ;)
  
&gt; (Recht schreibt man in obigem Satz übrigens groß, weil es das Recht ist... nur so nebenbei und weils gerade zum Thema passt... ;))
  
Da hätten wir dann schon die nächste Diskussion. Lust? :)

true,meidei,CYPR,Demilitarised Cyprus 2015 Special: isyan! devrim! özgürlük!,"Not very much. What I said was applicable to Greece's Greek as well. It's the same process happening in both countries, independently. 

We need to have in mind that language varieties exist in a continuum and different variants are perceived differently. For example, we don't bat an eye when people on TV newscasts speak in [Cypriot Koiné](http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~arvaniti/Arvaniti.MedLR.pdf), we consider it the norm, we actually think that it's Standard Greek. Of course a Greek person will tell you that the words, the grammar, the phonology, sometimes even the morphology and the pragmatic indicators(1) are uncanny, not quite the Standard Greek they are used too, while we think it's ""you know, Standard Greek, like in the books"". It's a different standard which emerges from Cypriot dialects being levelled due to urbanisation and the inevitable centralisation. This happened separately in Greece few decades earlier. 

Now, Cypriot Koiné is stigma-less in our eyes, but further down you go to more ""rural"" dialects, the stigma goes up. In the same time, those variants become more similar and less pronounced. The 1974 relocation ""helped"" speed-up this process too. 

My second point of course is something we already discussed over /r/cyprus on occasions. The teaching methods for the native language are severely outdated and are almost solely responsible for the low rate of mastering Standard Greek and destroying the ""linguistic self-esteem"" of the students. We won't go far with a system that says ""You Cypriots can't speak proper Greek so better shut up and recite what I wrote on the blackboard"" (and that's exactly what happens: *they shut up* completely. we often compare Greek children being very talkative on TV, while Cypriot children are extremely camera shy and utter single-word answers). Instead, we need a bidialectal approach of ""You already speak a variant of Greek and there's no shame in that. Let's take a look at other variants of Greek in the real-life contexts we are likely to use them"". But for some reason people react as if we propose that Cypriot Greek is a language (which not only false, as mastery of Standard Greek is the goal (along with stopping the linguistic shaming) but also because the label 'language' is not really in the scope of the science of language. It's a political term and has to do with national identity etc. For linguistics, they are all linguistic varieties which form a supra-group called ""Modern Greek"").

So, in short, bad native language teaching, like the Cypriot system, is much more of a threat to Greek than English. We *literally* produce people who are ashamed of talking Greek. Any variant of Greek.

(1) we often come across as irony-impaired and easily offended to Greek people's eyes, but  it boils down to how we feel about some speech acts, and how Greeks use them differently. Conversely, Cypriots will sometimes say that Greeks are rude and overly-familiar, again, because the way we use the language differs.",0,1376598685,null,0,false,0,cboip50,t3_1kf4bg,t1_cboip50,t1_cbof7k1,null,1429816398,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

&gt; If that's not possible, I was wondering how good the transport is into the tourist areas

The Métro and RER (*Reseau Express Régionel* meaning Regional Express Network) within Paris are both excellent and incredibly efficient. Also, if you understand a bit of french, the bus system can come in handy and would come as a great way of seeing the city. The tickets are simple if you keep it that way: you can buy a ticket for any distance in the metro, bus, RER (within central zone 1 Paris), and tram for 1h30 and you can buy a pack of 10 of those for a reduced price oer ticket. There are also day tickets and weekly cards you can get (weekly will come in the form of a *Navigo* card). Also, although a subject I'm still reluctant on, try and avoid the *Paris Visite* ticket as, to my understanding, there are cheaper options and I've only heard bad things about it, but I don't fully know...

&gt; As a muslim couple, would we be well received with wearing a hijab?

Touchy subject. Sure, as others say, you might get some looks... But if roaming through touristy areas, the majority of the people there will also be foreign tourists, so not that much trouble there... Do take in mind that the full veil ^(excuse my ignorance for the names of each type of veil) covering the face is illegal in France... but the looks and stares only originate through that law; there is still a large Muslim community in both France and Paris, so you'll be alright...

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"I really don't know what to tell you. That sucks. I know of one person who lives at home, and he is a loser that hasn't worked in years. I guess I don't know how stuff works over there, but the only people older than 20 living at home do so out of choice, or lazyness. I moved out at 18 and never looked back. Housing and apartments are easy to find, and relatively cheap. My landlord is my age (26), and owns 3 or 4 houses (although he buys older cheaper homes, and fixes them up so its not liking he's going around buying brand new mansions). 

&gt;...but at the moment some things in this country can make me tear up considering i'm a retired marine that had to move back in with his mother after getting a honorable discharge due to government budget cuts. 

This sort of stuff happens though too. If you work for the government here, the pay will be modest. You won't be poor, but you will probably never be more than just ""good enough"" to justify what you what do. And the specter of budget cuts is always looming. The private sector is much better to work for. My brother is in the Army reserve (kind of like being retired, but you still have to occasionally do stuff for them), and he is barely getting by. He still lives in his own home with his wife and kids, but he lives in rural texas where the property/housing is very cheap. He probably would be struggling a lot more if he lived in the city/suburbs.

But then again I guess that kind of makes sense. The Netherlands is rather constrained by its geography, where the US basically spans a continent. There is never a shortage of land here, so I guess we don't face the same obstacles you guys do. Good luck though. Hopefully you can get your own place soon.

The changes to the rules are not negotiated by ""self-identifying federalists"" but by national governments.
