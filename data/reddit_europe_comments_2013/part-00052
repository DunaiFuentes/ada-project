true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"I used to think like this as well, until I moved to the UK and saw that it does make a difference. The education system here is, in my opinion, rather poor compared to other European countries and I was always wondering why that is, considering its high reputation. 

Private education causes two problems, I think. Firstly, it shifts attention away from the state school system. Many affluent and even less-than-affluent people realise there is a disadvantage if you put your child to a state school, as opposed to a private one. These people, often professionals and many working within influential spheres, simply avoid the challenge by paying their way out of the problem. Without private education, there would be much more of an incentive and drive from these people to fix the inferior state school system. 

The second problem is related to the first: the inherent injustice of the system. I am one of those who believe that, for a society to truly progress the best way it can, people have to be given an equal chance to contribute the best they can. I see more sense in giving a pool of 10 million children an optimal shot at innovation, creativity etc. as opposed to giving a pool of 1 million a brilliant chance and 9 million a significantly poorer one. 

That is, I concur, just my opinion though - which is what the OP was asking for. It just dismays me when a particular degree at a particular university accepts 85% of its students from private schools, 10% from state ones and 5% from abroad - which is certainly not correlated with the general population. There are schools where 90%+ of its students go to Oxford or Cambridge. There are others where no one does. 

This is not how society is divided in real life. And, from personal experience, I think this is detrimental - fields like science or medicine suffer for it, because this system prefers people who 'know how to play the system' based on life-long training and connections rather than genuinely creative and innovative individuals. 

A shift away from a private system to a state one would mean *a)* more people would care about and have a vested interest in an improved state education and *b)* the equal starting board (or at least as equal as it can be) would allow true talent and effort to shine, not just access to the right textbooks, teachers and tuition fees. 

As a final remark - yes, I do know of many examples of people from underprivileged backgrounds 'making it'. I know them very well and I know it can happen. And for every single one of them, I know of ten others who did not have that lucky break and who, in my opinion, would have had excellent careers in this field or the other. One of society's success stories does not make up for ten of its failures.

You are also saying that the EU can't do anything about the corruption, and they are completely helpless if someone doesn't follow the rules? 

That is a an extremely weird attitude, and above all, incorrect. Saying that only powerful countries have the right to complain is a supreme attitude, that is extremely non democratic, nor does it serves it citizens. 

Furthermore, claiming that the EU is this helpless entity, that can not act if the rules are bent is wrong to. The EU does have that power- they just choose not to use it because they are corrupt. 

You attitude towards smaller states and democracy, and towards how the EU should work against the corruption is in itself an argument against the whole European Project. Claiming that the EU can't stop payment or fine states is an outright lie actually, as well as saying that they don't have to obey rules. I'll rather take my chances with non corrupt entities, where at least rules are being followed. 

The EU should be careful though, even though you say they are completely helpless. Corruption is extremely damaging to society, at every level, and it scares investors and normal people away.

Basically, I can see why people would instinctively want to pay for both better education and healthcare (desire to survive and all); I just think this way of thinking is a bit counter-intuitive and hurts us as a whole in the end. 

It's the same argument as with social stratification in general: yes, one's work should perhaps be rewarded, however, in too stratified a society, an extra room in your house will matter little if it means someone in your neighbourhood resorts to crime because they have nowhere to live - crime you, as the wealthy one, are likely to be the target of.  

Certainly, this line of thinking is less clear-cut when it comes to healthcare, but I think the first part of my argument from the other comment still holds - privatisation takes away motivation and effort when it comes to improving the state system. 

With healthcare, the other problem is that, at least in the United Kingdom, it is never truly privatised - the effects are clearly felt in the state sector. Bigger hospital rooms for private patients? In some hospitals, this means there's 20 fewer beds in total. And that someone in need of that bed will have to be sent home. 

Doctors frequently have 'private' slots in their working days, private patients receive priority allocations etc. - all contributing to the longer waiting times, slower processing periods and so on in the state sector. This has a knock-on effect for the rest of us. 

To use a bit of tabloid logic, it means that a situation may arise where a psychiatrist preferentially treats a student with a pre-exam anxiety attack as opposed to examining a psychotic patient who then goes on to hurt others. It is tabloid logic, but I'm mentioning it here because it has happened. 

Looking at it from an overall perspective, I don't think an extra cupboard and a larger TV set is worth someone else not getting a room. I don't think an anxiety-ridden pre-exam teenager should get preference over a suicidal teenager, who cannot afford an out-of-hours therapist. The net effect is just not worth it for any of us, in my opinion. ",0,1363618694,null,0,false,0,c8xtkci,t3_1ain4d,t1_c8xtkci,t1_c8xstao,null,1431623417,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

As much as you'd like it, we can't afford to pay for debt. We have our own house to pay for. We have our own families to feed.

Countries accumulate debt because they cant afford to pay for everything. This is thought to be sustainable ""because future growth will pay for current debt"".

The problem is, politicians see a surplus in budget as something to spend. All surplus is spent, but nothing is ever cut. What is the solution? Take more debt!

* Spend all budget surplus on more stuff

* When you run out of money, take more debt

* Oh hey, our balance is positive again! Let's spend it!

Our language is one of the things we're proud of (that song includes Austria as well so it's relevant) and what defined us before there was one German nation. The German speaking nations were always a very diverse bunch of dialects and even Otto the Great in the 11th century didn't give a crap that the Saxon Old German dialect wasn't how a king is supposed to talk. If you can't deal with the language (it's probably just the different versions of Standardeutsch that are important today), you either have to learn it or move. Nobody will bend over because you don't like the local dialect. ",0,1363619096,null,0,false,0,c8xto8t,t3_1ain4d,t1_c8xto8t,t1_c8xtd9g,null,1431623472,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

I can certainly see how a disinterest in public schools by the elite puts them at a disadvantage. We have hardly any private schools here and the public ones seem to be doing fine.

But even in our public schools, the kids who come from fairly wealthy parents often perform better than the ones from rather poor parents. I think this is simply a matter of genetics, with smart parents breeding smarter children. There are of course many exceptions to this, but I doubt an abolition of private schools would see many more poor children rise to the top.

Actually, Sweden might make money from it (we are not overly fond of our wickedly strong krona though, it is just strong because everyone else sucks, it is creating problems for us) but not Gernany etc in the long run, since they gave to bail out everyone, and it will bite them in the ass, massively.

And no, I don't think one can explain to the northern voters that they have to send x % of their GDP south for the next 25 years. Also, there is fewer of us, and more of you. 

I honestly believe the best solution for Portugal is to leave the Euro, not the EU (I am sure that technicality can be arranged somehow). What do you have now, another 20 years of austerity? That is not a life, and I do believe it would be better if your destiny in your own hands. Whatever you choose though, it will not be easy. 

I do wish people understood though that this is not because of lazy southerners or evil Germans. If you look at the theory behind, it is rather evident that it would happen, and the only way to counteract it is really massive transfers. Basically, with such transfers, one need far deeper integration. Europe is not ready for that, and That doesn't name anyone evil. 

I do wish our leaders would spend more time (or any time) explaining these things. Now they are just running from one bad rescue to another. 

Perhaps we should also speak clearly about what the EU is to us. I see it as a trade union, and more corrupt and worse with money than my country, to be given as little influence as possible, since they also have horrendous crises management. Seriously - can there be a worse bank save ? Obviously - you might see it in another way, and a person from Poland in a third way.

The newspaper goes on to report that Gunvor has, however, totally refuted the existence of any links between it and Mr Putin. Gunvor stated in response to the Wikileak disclosure that Timchenko and Tornqvist owned ""a large majority of Gunvor"" and that a ""minority stake is owned by an employee benefit trust"". It went on to say that ""the company had taken out credit facilities which require full disclosure of company ownership"".[24]

Was that ever in doubt? I mean, it was meant to be a hard currency, and adaptations to it if necessary, of fiscal (read painful) nature. Should be warning enough for any future competitiveness deviations though. 

But yes, nobody is simply prepared to give an inch in their economic interests, and the power relationship is currently just as you describe it. 

What I found impressive during this crisis, is how many mechanism, how great a realignment of EU institutions happened during it. and they have still avoided outright transfers, while creating a fairly credible set of mechanism to protect the currency.

Overall results might be more desirable this way I think - a more credible hard currency that doesn't provoke as much resentment as actual transfers would. And a more sensible monetary policy in the south, then the current habit of just inflating away their problems, hence ensuring permanently vulnerable economies. Hopefully also eurobonds of some form and with sufficient guarantees will appear on the political horizon, to make collective borrowing in reasonable amounts cheaper for everyone.

I'm not an expert on our dysfunctional education system, but I'll make a layman's attempt at explaining it.  Our state schools are funded largely out of local property taxes.  That means a school in a poor town will be underfunded, whereas one in a rich suburb will be excellent because it has lots of money and lots of rich parents demanding good results.  This means that couples with children who care about education tend to flee to these rich suburbs.  That led to a further degradation of inner city schools.  So, to counter this, places like Chicago created new ""magnet"" or ""charter"" schools, with the goal of making a few flagship schools that are on par with the best suburban ones.

One of the eurozone’s smallest members has been let down and Cypriots will feel it has lost credibility, an academic claims

In insisting on the deposit raid the eurozone has let down one of its smallest and most defenceless members — and for a sum of money that is “a rounding error” in EU terms, a leading Cypriot economist has warned.

Christopher Pissarides, a Nobel prize-winning academic based at the London School of Economics, told The Times that the overall bailout package agreed on Saturday may put Cyprus’s public finances on a more sustainable footing by putting the level of public debt to GDP at 100 per cent.

But this came at a serious cost, he warned. “As far as Cypriots are concerned, and Greeks I guess, the eurozone has lost credibility. They feel let down. After all Cyprus did not try to exploit low interest rates to spend and spend. The root cause of the problem is that Cypriot banks were heavily invested in Greek bonds and when the Greek haircut arrived they could not absorb it. So the Greek troika caused the problem, and then came to punish the innocent Cypriot saver with another hit on top.”

Professor Pissarides expected the decision to provoke a flight from Cyprus by foreign holders of large deposits, but that small savers had few alternatives to local banks so they may have to keep their savings in existing accounts. Holders of deposits below €30,000 should have been exempted from the deal, he argued.

“How can you go back to the people and tell them that this has helped the stability in the eurozone? It has let down one of its small and powerless members and this causes uncertainties and instabilities in the future. And all for €5.8 billion — about as big as a rounding error in the eurozone.”

The problem, Professor Pissarides argued, was that the alternative rescues offered to the Cyprus Government were even less palatable than the one that is now being put to a vote in the country’s Parliament.

“It will be interesting to see what happens in Spain and Italy this week,” he said. “This shows that the IMF in particular is planning to be very tough in its rescue packages and they know how to hurt.”

(1) Somehow make people value **freedom of expression** at least as high as the other human rights, that regularly trump freedom of expression under German law.

Examples: Germany has laws against libel that go way too far IMO; there's a law against verbally insulting others (i.e. if I call you ""asshole"", I have to pay a fine); most Germans, even those that spend all their time on the Internet, don't mind that a place like 4chan or reddit could not be legally hosted in Germany itself.

Everyone who stores their money in banks knows that there is a very small risk that someday the bank can fail. The bank customers are the stakeholders in that enterprise, and they might be out of pocket. However, at that moment, there is SUPPOSED to be deposit insurance to cover people's accounts up to a certain limit.

That deposit insurance is not some sort of government handout or charity to those who are unfortunate. It's put in place in order to make the banking system possible, from day to day. People need to have confidence that their money is safe in banks. They aren't accepting risk in order to gain a reward of high interest rates or other investment return. All they want is for the very same money that they put in that cupboard to be there tomorrow when they open it up again.

Wolfgang Schäuble, the Finance minister of Germany, is trying to weasel out of his complicity in this fateful decision which was made in secret in Brussels, in press conferences saying that he ""didn't insist"" that those with less money in their accounts would be affected by this decision. However, the fact is that he did something very illegal under European law in even agreeing to the deal where 6,5% was to be taken from people who have less than 100.000 Euros in their account.  

In doing so, he had a hand in undermining the confidence of bank account owners all over southern Europe... and it is possible that we could now see runs on the banks in the very countries which are the most vulnerable. 

It's certainly legitimate for every Euro-cent above €100.000 to be lost in these dire circumstances - because that was not insured. However, governments are obliged to do all they can to make sure every penny of EU citizen accounts up to €100.000 is secure.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Turanism#Turanism_and_Hungarian_fascism

&gt;The leader of the Hungarian fascist Arrow Cross Party, Ferenc Szálasi, believed in the existence of a ""Turanian-Hungarian"" race (which included Jesus Christ). The idea was a key part of his ideology of ""Hungarism"". In Hungary some fascists (and non-fascists) tried to link the ancestors of the Hungarians to Timur, the Ottomans and Japan, which some Hungarians of the 1930s described as the 'other sword of Turan' (the first sword being Hungary).

[...]

&gt;Many christian Hungarian Turanists held the view that Jesus Christ was not a Jew but a proto-Hungarian or a “noble of Parthia”. The theory of “Jesus, the Parthian prince” are such, or the revivification of real or supposed elements of priest-magicians of ancient “magic” Middle-Eastern world, shamanism, and pagan ancient Hungarian religion. Also some muslim Turkish Turanists held the view that Muhammad was not an Arab but a Sumerian, and Sumerians are Turanid according to Turanist theses. It is an opportunity for the Christian Turanists to link Jesus Christ to the ancient middle-eastern mystery and the ancient pagan Hungarian beliefs. Both Catholic and Protestant religious leaders of Hungary acted against this theory and beliefs.",0,1363629166,null,0,false,0,c8xwrdu,t3_1aiozv,t1_c8xwrdu,t1_c8xue3r,null,1431624850,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

If a machine can't use a required type of wheel, it may have a downtime and then replace that wheel with another type of wheel, but if it requires fuel and that fuel has to be replaced it may not be possible since there may not be technology at all yet to do it.

Even when there are alternative energy technologies for operating a certain piece of technology, that energy has to be extracted somehow. Extracting for example fuel from the middle of the ocean increases the energy required to do it and also the cost. A bonus catch here is that after a point it may be pointless, not economically, but physically to obtain that energy since if it requires more for extraction than what it produces then it's not energy anymore, it's just a product that may be only used for special industry uses (e.g. plastics).

The general idea is that all that 'interconnected energy world' is directly related to wealth generated since it directly and indirectly affects efficiency of production with only new technologies being the other fundamental factor. But if you cut energy supply too much even new technologies of extraction might be unable to catch up.

In general the world has to know all that and to also understand growth without energy and efficiency of use of energy is impossible. Energy is not just a product.",0,1363630783,null,0,false,0,c8xxbq8,t3_1ail9u,t1_c8xxbq8,t1_c8xx1tt,null,1431625128,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

What you want is the background story. So be it.

Not since the classic tennis game of  Marcos Baghdatis had Demetris felt such emotion. 10% gone. Again and again he calculated his finances. Brooded over bank statements. But he could change nothing. It just wasn't enough anymore. 

He had worked extra shifts at the cannery the last three years. For that  he had to give 4-year old to the maternal grandparents for care taking. He worked in Nikosia as a taxi driver on the weekends, giving young British soldiers from Akotiri tours of the ancient city, and to the cat houses. Every penny he'd saved.

He wanted to provide for his son, leave him something, the home he himself had missed during the years at the orphanage. His head became dizzy again. The cancer medicaments would only prolong the inevitable, the doctors in St Spiridon Hospital in the city had said. Demetris let out a almost inaudible sigh.

After the unfortunate death of his wife at childbirth, he did what he could. Now it wasn't enough anymore, he could not buy the house. He'd lived in th small, white hut almost all his life now, first as a tuna fisher, then, after his illness started, he had to go to the cannery for work. The sale of the family fishing boat had provided the start of the house fund. Almost the same sum that the state would take. He would not be able to buy the home his son needed now.

He decided he would not give up. He could not give up. He thought of his wife. He had made a promise to her that day, hadn't he? Another pill against the pain, and he could go back to the can factory. He still could make it to the night shift.",0,1363630945,null,0,1363639063,0,c8xxdop,t3_1aijsd,t1_c8xxdop,t1_c8xv3fc,null,1431625156,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Although in this particular case, the assumptions are obviously absurd, the fact that, on the whole, a university graduate is more likely to have a stable job than an immigrant with a high school or lesser education means that it's one the insurer can afford to make, particularly if each has only been in the workforce for a few years. We could hypothetically rule out the element of race, but education level is kind of inseparable from the calculation.

When the UK had to bail out its banks it could print.

And RBS' repayment of £163 billion in May last year shows the UK had to print more than Cyprus needs.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17944066

Then the pound devalued from c. €1.50 the pound to c. parity briefly in at the end of 2008 - the beginning of 2009.

And the point of all this is that the UK is still standing and that money in UK banks is safe, albeit subject to erosion by inflation and fluctuations in value.

Of course, you can hedge against this by holding accounts in dollars, euros and pounds if you want to.

The comparison with Cyprus couldn't be starker.

Controlling your own money allows you to print and devalue to buy time to address your problems.

From there it's only a few minutes' walk past the Aurelian Column down the back streets to the Pantheon, and then on to the 'typewriter' at Piazza Venezia.

Regarding the rest, it will eat your time, but it's worth it: I'd say allow half a day for the Vatican, and half a day for the Colosseum *and Forum*. Seriously, don't miss the Forum.

If you want a beaten track a little off the beaten track, go to Via Appia Antica, which is a bus ride from Piramide metro station.

This thing may actually be true, but there are a lot of other things going around too like for example the Cypriots almost walked out of the meeting because they didn't want *any* deposit levy, but it soon was made clear to them that the deposit levy *will* happen.

Ever since this blew up, almost everyone has been dodging the responsibility of whos fault it actually was. There were lots of rumours that the deposit tax they were initially after was in the range of 30-40% of the total deposits.

For example, on bloomberg:
&gt; Schaeuble drew criticism from the Cypriot side for heavy- handed tactics. At one point, a Cypriot official said under cover of anonymity, he demanded a 40 percent depositor tax. A Schaeuble aide contacted by Bloomberg didn’t immediately respond to that observation.

Now try to apply this: You are told ""you have x amount of euros in your bank system.. find a way to loot exactly y amount"". The looting of any amount below the 100k threshold is certainly what makes this situation even more silly, clearly -- but the concept of looting any amount of savings is controversial as well. The rich people drawing out all of their money from the under performing countries is also a very bad thing.

As mentioned elsewhere, the damage is done now -- it may not even matter whos fault it was afterall. How do we proceed now? Seems like what could have been a relatively cheap bailout will end up needing a big bazooka of sorts to restore the eurozone credibility.

edit: The cypriots were told to approve this bailout on Sunday before the markets are opened. Here we are pushing the date when the banks will open again and when the vote will happen because everyone knows the vote is currently ""no"". The eurogroup is trying to negotiate new stuff as we speak.

While this study is great for creating further policy it only shows that as things are, piracy is not hurting Music sales.

Will this correlation still hold true if the population has an expectation that digital music is free vs a population that knows it is simple, but illegal

Don't get me wrong, you might be right, Cyprus *might* just be making a collapse of their banking system considerably worse than it otherwise would have been. On the other hand a collapse is so bloody bad for any country, especially within the context of the eurozone, that countries are willing to try stuff like this to avert it because, ultimately, wiping out 7-10% of people's savings isn't really that big a deal in comparison to the collapse of a countries banking system.

I mean lets face it, people are losing just over 2-3 years worth of interest at current Cypriot rates. That's not really that far off from the effects QE has had in many countries since the recession started.

If the government decides to spare the poorest bank accounts, wealthy people and investors will be even more reluctant to ivnest in the future as they don't want to be the scapegoat (poor rich people, I know, but that's beside the point). If they dont' spare anyone, there's a bank run from common bank account holders, that is, the majority of investors. Majority in terms of population and capital. Even if a tiny elite has a disproportionate amount of wealth, it's still the minority and not enough to supoprt the banks alone. 

And this tiny elite of big investors will also go for the bank run. But the banks can't support it anyway so basically everyone leaves poorer out of this. This means less investments in the future, and meanwhile a drop in purchase power. The economy will shrink, the banks will still need to be capitalized by the government. The burden on tax-payers will increase tenfold even though they'll have less money.",0,1363649905,null,0,false,0,c8y48ek,t3_1air2g,t1_c8y48ek,t1_c8y3uvy,null,1431628452,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Well, not.

But this is a very interesting question. There's been nothing on our media about this... had to dig more...

&gt;Gennady Timchenko is a Finnish citizen born in the Soviet Union in 1952. He has more than 20 years experience in the oil industry, beginning with the Kirishi refinery during perestroika, and was one of the first Russians to export oil to Europe after the Soviet Union collapsed.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunvor_%28company%29

&gt;Gunvor Group Ltd is a global commodity trading company registered in Amsterdam, with its main trading office in Geneva, Switzerland.[1] Gunvor also has trading offices in Singapore, the Bahamas and Dubai, with a network of representative offices around the globe. The company operates in the trade, transport, storage and optimization of petroleum and other energy products, as well as having investments in oil terminal and port facilities. Its operations consist of securing crude oil upstream and delivering it to market via pipelines and tankers.

&gt;The company, which was founded in 1999, is the fourth largest crude oil trader in the world after Glencore, Vitol, and Trafigura, and is controlled by Gennady Timchenko and Torbjörn Törnqvist.[3][4]

&gt;Gunvor's largest single supplier of crude oil is Russia, though the company also trades African, Asian and South-American crude and is active on all continents.[5] Currently Gunvor trades less than 20% of Russia's seaborne oil.[6]

&gt;""Gunvor"" is an Old Norse name meaning ""careful in fighting"".[7] Torbjörn Törnqvist's mother was named Gunvor.[citation needed]

One does plan to go full communist? Then I invite you to travel back in time to the wonderfull times in the USSR and eastern europe where the economy flourished! (NOT).

Food is a basic human right. Of course they should get that. Seen me imply otherwise? Want cheaper food? Maybe ask the rest of the EU to invest more in the CAP they'll love that idea. [sarcasm]
Maybe fixing the economy so people can pay it could help reverse that trend though.[hint]

If you'r talking about inflation then yeah that's a consequence of that crisis we'r talking about. One could solve that by solving the crisis problems. Which I don't see Beppe doing. Or what will he start? Some kind of wage indexing like we in Belgium have with the money that he will magically conjure out of his comedians hat?

&gt;No sympathy for communities and local economies ready to run into major problems when oil hits $300/barrel.

Oh shit it's not as if that shit costs even more here in Belgium. Thing is we can still pay it so far because our economy is not as fucked. You know what would help over there? Somebody who fixes that! You know what I haven't seen? A single point from Beppe that would actually lead to that getting fixed.

and where does the conservatism come from? From what did you derive that I would be conservative? I think there should be a lot of change in Italy. The realistic and not downright bonkers type of change though.

Examples you gave include all kinds of change. All kinds of change that require magic money to appear and think that by spending a lot on the people will make the economy better. Guess what.

Racking up debts with increasing interest rates that even your grandgrandchildren will still curse you for is not one of those things.

&gt; The Cypriot government categoriacally refuted on Monday statements that it had rejected the proposal for smaller bank accounts to be exempted from the one-off tax to support the country's flagging economy and its credit sector.

&gt; In a strongly-worded statement issued by spokesman Christos Stylianides about an hour after the postponement of the vote of the measdures in Parliament in order to amend the measures, Nicosia rejected claims attributed to German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that Cyprus turned down the idea of a 40 percent levy on accounts in excess of 100,000 euros, and said that the plan was imposed on the Cypriot government.

&gt; **The statement cites President Nicos Anastasiades as saying that ""he categorically denies he was ever given the option of exemption of guaranteed depostis, i.e. deposits up to 100,000 euros.""**

Another source:

http://famagusta-gazette.com/government-denies-that-cyprus-president-dismissed-exclusion-of-deposits-und-p18572-69.htm

&gt; In a written statement, Stylianides says that **President Anastasiades fought to avert this “unprecedented development”, which he adds “has been imposed in a coercive manner by those who try today to justify their own decisions”.**

&gt; Their position, he went on, was that the non-inclusion of depositors with savings up to 100,000 euros would not secure the necessary bailout sum.

&gt; Cyprus’ lenders, according to Stylianides, asked during the last Eurogroup meeting the closure of two major Cypriot banks, the transfer of deposits up to 100,000 euros to a “good bank” and the clearance of the rest of the deposits.

&gt; The Government Spokesman also added that the IMF estimated that these deposits would lose 40% of their deposits, while remaining frozen for 5-10 years. He went on by saying that the European Commission said the total loss would be much bigger, with catastrophic results for the whole economy.

&gt; The government, through its comprehensive proposal to protect depositors has safeguarded that their contribution does not equal to a definite loss, Stylianides said.

We can't look at the matter from a moral standpoint, because people's morals differ, but from a cost vs. benefit one: the overall impact this practice has on society; and then use that analysis to decide how we want to act on it.

Looking at it this way, the fact that the vast majority of downloads are not hurting sales in any way, and that the benefits might outweigh the costs, is a very relevant argument to consider legalization in those countries where it is not yet legal. It's not a simple topic, so further studies would be necessary to extract firmer conclusions.

This is just speculation, but I am fairly certain that the dramatic decrease of revenue has to do with the widening of possibilities that the current times offer to the consumer; not only illegitimate downloads, but services like Grooveshark or Spotify, which bring some money to the industry but not as much as CD sales did in their time. A pay-per-unit model for digital goods (which, unlike their physical counterpart, have only an initial cost) can be very beneficial for the seller, but when people has had access to them in a way that beats it in both service quality and price, they are not going to come back to that unless the model is thoroughly revised to suit the customer and the times.",0,1363656389,null,0,false,0,c8y6itl,t3_1ajsc3,t1_c8y6itl,t1_c8y56fa,null,1431629517,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

We know music revenue has fallen massively since the onset of piracy. We don't know if that is a result of piracy, of piracy and some other stuff, or stuff entirely different to piracy.

We also don't know the long-term viability of services like Spotify. Its a fantastic idea, but as yet a grossly unprofitable one. Net losses of $37m in 2010 and $59m in 2011. 2012 is forthcoming. [Here.](http://mashable.com/2012/10/05/spotify-revenues/) It won't disappear anytime soon (or rather, this business type won't). Deezer scored €100m from Time Warner so the music business obviously wants to make it work to counter whatever is going drastically wrong.

Whether music companies like it or not their margins are going to come down a lot thanks to downloads (legal and illegal). All that remains to be seen is whether torrents are legalised. The more margins fall for music companies as digital music gets cheaper, imo the less likely torrents are to be legalised. If music gets dirt cheap then there's going to be little weight to pro-torrent arguments other than ""I don't like paying"".",0,1363658999,null,0,false,0,c8y7gpa,t3_1ajsc3,t1_c8y7gpa,t1_c8y6itl,null,1431630050,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm already not gonna vote EPP this time around anyway.

Why don't we add a new dimension to this crap and call an immediate referendum on the EU in all countries at the same time? I think this is the only way that the european politicians will end up co-operating to save this crap and hard truths to come out of it. A few countries leave? good, we're currently locked in a unanimous decision union with a lot of procrastinators.. it needs to become a majority vote -- there are just too many of us and we are all focused on our own little agendas nowerdays. EU Budget coming up? 2 issues: 1) What my country can get out of it, 2) How much less my country can pay into it -- every single country is guilty of this -- we have no *true* common goal or vision -- just a few bullet point things due for the next decade that we never actually accomplish fully.

I'm fed up of the current democratic deficit generating an even greater democratic deficit with policies meant to appeal only to certain countries' voters (a minority of the total population of the EU -- fact.) leading to 'solutions' which end up making the problems they are trying to address bigger. Have we already forgotten why the EU was created? It's because we're all assholes to eachother -- I just hope we haven't crossed the point where some assholes won't acknowledge that and feel really smug about themselves (it applies both ways by the way)

The euro needs fiscal transfers to survive just like the us dollar does. It's that we're making a huge fuss about it each time trying to spin it as ""here they go again, taking our tax money"" and making each parliament to approve each one is just asking for a massive outrage each time this happens. This is the fatal flaw of the euro and either it will be addressed or it's going to fall apart and we're all going to hate eachother over it.

The german elections won't even fix anything.. the 2 most likely to win candidates are campaigning on who is going to be harder on the eurozone bailouts (and this is one of the reasons this 'solution' was devised in Cyprus). It seems that every bailout that passes gets worse and public opinion will not ever allow the fiscal transfers to become a reality as we're currently going (leading to a eurozone breakup anyway).

People knew the current crisis would eventually happen, they just assumed that they would have gone for the fiscal union immediately before the shit hit the fan. This hasn't happened.

If the euro was created with the fiscal union, nobody would have been any wiser and our eurozone crisis would have been non-existent today likely, and we probably wouldn't be hearing about taxpayers money being wasted on stinky lazy corrupt money-laundering southerner russian oligarchs.

I fear that if we continue down the path we are witnessing right now, with each bailout becoming worse, we are going to live to see the breakup of the EU followed by a rapid rise in nationalism.

The funny part in all of this is that the bailouts are actually for-profit loans. All contributions are made on the *condition* that there will definitely be a profit in it for them -- what the hell is the outrage about -&gt; the outrage is what is making it likely that you are going to lose your money altogether. I think it's ok that some form of austerity is going on because you cannot spend more than you have forever, but the hostility (nationalism) the countries are showing towards eachother is causing even more financial trouble for everyone.

They likely used populism/nationalism so much in these bailouts that they now have to create a new crisis which will cost way more money to the taxpayers just to be able to justify bailing out Cyprus (""well.. it seems they are a systemic risk afterall.. we're gonna need 50 billion, oh and by the way.. we might not help Spain with their new troubles now.""). At some point this sort of strategy will backfire. There was an analysis ages ago which suggested we would have paid way less than we currently have under a fiscal union. One of the reasons for this is that the most of the damage we're having to pay for is the damages coming from the uncertainty of arranging the bailouts.

In the current situation with widespread high-speed internet, physical copies just provide too little incentive to the consumer to keep being relevant, so it's just a matter of time until they become the equivalent of vinyls today; if this tendency proves to be true, then the link (or lack of thereof) between piracy and digital downloads is a key point.

true,ThePhlogist,ENGL,England,"This vision kind of defeats the entire purpose of a political and economic union. This is the exact same mistake right wing politicians make here in the UK. A union necessarily involves the strengthening of the weak by the strong for the benefit of a stable whole. I don't doubt there needs to be a point at which the EU needs to stop expansion and consolidate and actually achieve the goals of the union in the weaker countries producing some successes. If the union continues expanding it's boarders (to include more net-receiver countries) and it's budgets it will only encourage antipathy from the contributors (as we have seen) and will keep adding costs to the EU budget so that the current budget can't actually be used to benefit the current EU. Making the current EU stronger will allow for increases in the budget that can be justified because they resulted from EU help. 

Instead of going for a 29th country after Croatia joins in July maybe the EU should accept the budget cuts it has to deal with and make some tangible progress they can point to when people ask what good the EU has done. It will raise it's profile and popularity while benefiting the members further. Contraction like envisioned in the article would not mean much. Rich countries who produce and import lots of good have always been close partners by necessity. A Germanic union would be a formalisation of relations that exist regardless of any union. What this vision is merely suggesting is 'Let's get rid of the EU because we don't stand to make much money if we support other countries. Don't mind the fate of the countries that boarder ours, don't mind about future war, lets just go back to 1950'. 

I don't think the author thinks that but from the articles i've read it appears ['the big hit to ordinary Cypriot savers was an outcome that nobody seemed to be seeking but no one could find a way to prevent'.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/18/us-eurozone-cyprus-stumbled-insight-idUSBRE92H0RH20130318?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29&amp;utm_content=Bloglines) The only reason ordinary Cypriots pay more is because their President refuses to stop being a tax haven where companies can screw members of other member states and where Russian gangster can launder money for crime in Russia and possibly in the EU. None-the-less Cyprus is a smaller economy and a tougher approach is unlikely to be economically as disastrous as Spain or Italy.

true,prahoveaninbucuresti,ROMA,Romania,"&gt;There is a clear dichotomy between the ways of thinking in South and North Europe that has been there since the days of the Romans and the Germanic peoples and I doubt it will change in the next millennium.

I think this contradiction between South and North (with the north being more organized) developed much later then the time of the Romans. In that time, the Germanic tribes were the barbarians and the romans were the organized ones.

Also, a short history:

1. Much of northern Europe was civilized by the romans.
1. The Germanic tribes brought down the Roman Empire, event that started the dark ages around the 5th century.
1. During the dark ages, the Byzantine Empire was richer and more civilized than western and northern Europe. 
1. The Middle Ages ended when the Renaissance started in Italy in the 15th century.

What I am trying to say is that Northern Europe could not have become a hub for civilization without Southern Europe and also that times change and one day your country is the peak of civilization and the next century it is not. However, it is possible to “come back”; China is doing it in the last decades.

true,Paladin8,null,null,"Personally I think there are three sides to all this:

First, the Euro was a miscarriage. Sure I'm happy that Germany is reunited, even though we're still paying for it today and will continue to do so for quite some time - in addition to paying for economically weaker countries in Europe, mind you. The price for this however was that the Euro came without integration of financial, fiscal and economical politics and also too fast for too many. Reunification was immensely popular and no one really bothered to think about the common currency back then.

Second, people fucked up. Greece lied and deceived, Ireland went on a disastrous path, Portugal and Spain never really got on their feet and Italy elected Berlusconi n-1 times to often, n being the number of times he got elected. These economies shouldn't have become part of the Eurozone - not to punish them but because they just don't have the necessary competitiveness to share a currency with the central and northern european economies. I jokingly advocated for a second european currency called the ""Mediterrano"", which could be kinda coupled to the Euro, but not too strongly.

Third, we fucked up. Germans are dumbshits when it comes to economy, being scarred by hyperinflation almost a century ago, reconstruction after WWII and the very stable D-Mark we only very reluctantly gave up. Most don't get the difference between private debt and public debt and our politicians have done their best to feed this fear of debt, going as far as forbidding our states to make any new debt from 2016 on and allowing the federal government to take new debt only up to .35% of GDP per year.  
For the average person the last 15 years were pretty harsh, but apparently ""austerity"" worked, so everyone should do it that way. The idea that investments are necessary to upstart a failing economy doesn't even cross most people's minds and most don't understand that our success is supported by other people's debt.

Add to this a government whose solemn goal is to stay in power and the failure of other big countries to take a lead, coupled with a UK drifting away and a rapidly bloated (in terms of members) and already resented EU and you have a recipe for a failcascade of epic proportions. Things could have gone much smoother if our government had taken action much, much earlier, so Spain and Ireland wouldn't have to pay their banks with debt their government had to take on for some reason, and Greece wouldn't have to pay 20% interest and slide into depression.

true,forseti_,null,null,"What surprises me most about the opinions transported in the media here in Germany is that when Germany had to bailout its own banks there was a big debate going on about the necessity of all this. Many people and experts agreed that it was an option the let them go bankrupt. The level of frustration about the amount of money that was transferred to the banks was on a high. Unimaginable big sums. The German media spoke of a ""socialisation of the debt"" and meant that the risks got shouldered by the taxpayers, whereby the profit is exclusively for the banks. Just like an atomic plant that blows off and the government and people have to jump in to fix the situation.

It was frustrating to see this done for German banks, but then Greece needed help. In response Germany went all in in a crazy poker game where it has nothing to win just everything to loose. The whole German economy is at stake and the common Greek response was depicting us as Nazis trying to overthrow Europe. I don't agree with the politics of Merkel but this sentiment against Germany is just retarded. They hold the German people responsible for the Greek misery.

The current situation about the Cyprian banks is that the questioning about the necessity of a bailout got replaced by Schadenfreude about the Greek upper class losing some of its money that they brought out of Greece in the all to common attempt to piss against there own country. This again is an idiotic move from the Germans who talk like that, for this game is now played on the heads of the Cypriot people.

The solution that was settled on was to simply take a percentage of money out of all the bank accounts in Cyprus.  However, it was decided (by who is perhaps unclear, maybe the Cypriot leaders) to take about 6% from EVERY bank account, rather than taking a larger percentage from all deposits over 100k Euros (the threshold of guaranteed protection in case of bank failure). The problem is that this A) hits small account holders just as as much as all the Russian oligarchs who hold large accounts in Cyprus, who perhaps were the target of the original suggestion, and B) indicates that perhaps deposits in other close-to-failure countries like Spain and Italy are also not protected, contrary to law and despite the claims that this is a one-off event. All of this was announced simultaneous with the banks closing, and they have remained closed since.  The parliamentary vote to actually implement this decision has since been delayed several times as people are understandably furious, and as the Russians are now indicating they might withdraw all the money that remains and crash Cyprus' financial structure (and thus economy), so now it looks like Parliament will alter the terms of the deal in some way.

This is a (unfortunately very common) misconception. We are not bailing out the citizens, we are bailing out banks, politicians and governments. Regular citizens do not profit from these bailouts, or at least nearly as much as the corrupt elites of these countries, and their cronies.

The Greece government, for example, used bailout money to buy tanks, helicopters and even submarines[1], while at the same time increasing taxes sharply. No wonder the Greece people are pissed, not only does their situation get worse day by day, but by stabilizing the corrupt government, Germany (and the rest of the EU) takes away every chance of overthrowing them.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;True, Northern-European states could easily end the crisis through debt-relief programs, increased investments in PIGS countries, and by dismantling the structural deficiencies that plague the EMU and hinder the economic progress of the south. 

No, we could not. The problem is that a lot of the problems that is plaguing the southern Europe is because of the incorrectly constructed Euro. Southern Euro has lost 20-30 % of their internal competitiveness up until 2008, and probably more afterwards. Obviously, they can not move the currency and the interest rate any more, so the countries there are doing what they can, cutting costs, also known as austerity (and borrowing money to keep the country to a minimum standard). That difference in competitiveness is not something that is changed *easy*, but the reason it happened it Economics 101, it is what happen when you combine different economies in a currency union. It is nobody/everybodys fault. People knew this was happening, but ignored it, south and north. 

To offset the differences in competitiveness, you need massive transfer, permanent transfers and massive investments, over decades. Do you thing it will be done easily? 30 % of the north GDP sent to the south for the next 25 years (there are more people in the south than in the north).

Compare it with another currency union with differences in competitiveness, DDR and BRD (West Germany). When they joined DDR was much less competitive, and the unemployement and the cost increased quickly. However, unlike southern Europe, the BRD took care of the foreign debt, made sure the DDR had minimum standards of health care/school, unemployment benefits etc through permanent transfers from the West, took care of their banking, did massive investments and above all, had the full support of the people. That was 23 years ago, BRD has given *trillions* to the DDR and are *still* giving them over 100 billion Euros/year. Yet, you can still see the difference in productivity and unemplyment between East/West, 23 years after the fact. 

Do you think any country is willing to do that for the south? The Dutch handing over trillions (which would really fuck up their economy) to save Greece? Finland paying off Portugals debt, making sure their banks work + giving them X billion of Euros for the next 25 years? 

No, of course not, and it is not because the north is evil, or because the south deserves it. It is because we are not one country. No one has voted for a permanent transfer union, which would also, through necenssity, be a much deeper integrated union. Not enough people want that. And, above all - it is not something that can be done behind peoples back. People need to have a say in this, for it to have any democratic relevance. So far, the people voices haven't exactly been heard. 


What one should do, is that a few countries should exit the Euro, because things are not getting easier. It is not fun, but neither is 25 years of austerity.

&gt; Since 2009, Greece has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a complete professional army system, the government had promised that the mandatory military service would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. However, this timetable is under reconsideration as of April 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. These were caused by a combination of (a) financial difficulties, which meant that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and (b) widespread abuse of the deferment process, which meant that 66% of the draftees deferred service in 2005. In August 2009, the mandatory service was reduced to 9 months for the Land Army, while has remained to 12 months for the Navy and the Air Force.

As far as I know, German banks had a lot of money in the beginning of the 2000 years and threw money at everything with a slight chance of making profit, like real estate bubbles in e.g. Spain or Ireland. So supporting foreign banks and countries who support their banks now is probably only supporting our own banks through securing their loans. With taxpayers' money of course. As a German taxpayer, I am so proud to protect German banks profit (detect sarcasm here).
In Ireland, the country guaranteed for their banks debt, leaving the irish people with a per capita debt that will kill their economy. I mean, really, just *look* at the first three figures: http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/banking-crisis-bill-ireland-755464-Jan2013/ 
The debt that Ireland paid back with their taxpayers' money went to a confidential list of creditors. That list got leaked, guess who is on? The who-is-who of EU banks, including the Germans, of course.
So who is to blame? 

For the plenty greek hate that we get.. I think the media exaggerates everything. The amount of hate that they show us here is probably exaggerated and the amount of blame we have to take is probably exaggerated in the greece media as well. I only wonder why we never see Greek people protesting on the streets fighting for a better tax collection. If I may quote the EU IMF report:
&gt; In a rare display of annoyance from the International Monetary Fund, experts reviewing progress under the international financial support program for Greece in December rebuked Greece's *apathy* in implementing the necessary reforms to tackle revenue leakage.
&gt; Greek tax collectors are often over 50 years old, are underpaid, and some lack the necessary resources, or computer literacy, to efficiently undertake investigations. It also points out that more than one hundred of the nation's tax inspectors have wealth stored in accounts abroad, calling into question their integrity.

A common, and ridiculous idea.

Political Correctness is one thing. But the way it is used now is ""Not blaming everything on the muslim immigrants.""

The reason politicians don't just blindly blame immigrants and muslims is because they actually have some common sense and rational thinking capabilities, something which is not often shared with the ""Anti-immigration"" parties. There is a reason racism and bigotry is much more prominent in low-income and poorly educated societies.

They don't blame everything on immigrants because they know the issue is so much more complex than that. Economy, Social systems, Population etc. all weigh in. Not just culture. The anti-immigrants on the other hand simplify the question down to kindergarden level. They just think Muslims = Bad, and say we don't want them here.

Debate is always good. But we DO have debate. The problem is that there are a few extremists on both sides who completely spoil it for everyone else. If you say you don't support immigration, some people will immediately label you a racist.

However, if you say you support immigration, some people will accuse you of wanting your sister to get raped.

Many Anti immigrants hate that there is no debate, but due to their own arrogance and bigotry they are incapable of debating with anyone without resorting to namecalling and downvotes.

Also, something that is very common amongst those who vote for SD here is that they claim that SD is the only party that have a immigration policy. But the only thing that makes SD special is that they want to restrict immigration specifically from muslim countries. 

But literally 5 minutes of Wikipedia can tell that all our parties have immigration policies. The right tend to point towards more restrictions and higher requirements, while the left points towards more open immigration. SD are simply more radical.

This shows that a lot of people make claims about the other parties without even taking 5 minutes to double check them.

Overall, it is an infected debate due to idiots on both sides. But the debate exists. And the term Political correctness should not be used as a ""Doesn't generalize and hate muslims"" cover-word.

Your post is basically one big red herring. What am I supposed to reply? ""This is not my definition of political correctness, your post is now invalidated""?

It has zero, zilch to do with whether or not parties have immigration policies or not - of course they do. The political correctness part has to do with an unwillingness to make it into a major topic of debate. This is precisely what happened in Denmark until DF was big enough to get direct influence. Then suddenly it became OK to discuss immigration, but DF had already framed it in a toxic way.

I see the same thing happening in Sweden. Already the way you define it as either ""supporting immigration"" or not. This is not the sign of a healthy debate, it's the sign of an issue being hidden away by some politicians while the ones actually discussing it (such as Sverigedemokraterne) gain more and more votes.

un isola sono collocate le persone più felici che influenzano l'umore dei pochi che vanno su quell'isola. Se vuoi andare in quell'isola devi pagare un biglietto costosissimo, solo i ricchi possono permettersi di andare sull'isola felice, diventando ancora più felici di quello che sono, lasciando dietro di sè i poveri tristi e portandosi con sè la felicità che non dovranno condividere con loro.In quell'isola vanno di moda i capelli corti, che diventano il nuovo simbolo di benessere. I capelli corti ostentano il fatto che si è talmente felici che ci si può permettere di vivere in isole felici senza dover far nulla per gli altri.


Le isole felici si moltiplicano seguendo il modello della prima isola per ricchi. Quest isole iniziano ad attrarre capitali e altro benessere. La forbice tra gli isolani e i continentali si allarga sempre di più, chi se lo può permettere fugge. La storia ricorderà quelle settimane come la ""fuga dei felici"".


Nel continente aiutare agli altri fa debolmente salire la media di felicità di un'area così grande e in molti preferiscono pensare solo a sè stessi, ma i capelloni diventano i nuovi punti di riferimento,  persone in cui riporre la speranza e la voglia di cambiamento. I capelloni cercano di convincere tutti a placare la depressioni aiutandosi a vicenda.


Alcune città puntano tutto sull'altruismo e su strategie cooperative per far fronte la povertà, passo dopo passo, ci si sente meglio, grazie a piccoli gesti e l'impegno di molti. è considerato riprovevole  farsi vedere in pubblico con i capelli corti in quelle città. Ma si narra anche di alcune città la cui permanenza è una schiacciante agonia, la tristezza è insopportabile, nessuno viene aiutato e nessuno si aiuta perchè si è paralazzati da un'insopportabile angoscia e chi si avvicina a quei luoghi difficilmente trova le forze per uscire.

E' una cosa sacrosanta. Se c'è qualcosa che ha fatto danni in questo Paese è la bubbola dell'istruzione aperta a tutti. Si tratta dell'esempio perfetto di come tra enunciazioni di principio belle e nobili e ricaduta pratica delle medesime esistono scarti drammatici.

Inizia cinquant'anni fa giusti. 1962, governo Fanfani di centrosinistra non organico. Ai socialisti, che per entrare al giro successivo nella famosa stanza dei bottoni (dove scopriranno che i bottoni nemmeno ci sono, ma questo è un altro discorso) stanno sostenendo sforzi sovrumani va dato qualcosa. E questo qualcosa viene individuato nella riforma della scuola media unificata (in sostanza spariscono l'avviamento professionale e i corsi inferiori). Intento nobilissimo: ci entra dentro l'emancipazione delle classi lavoratrici, la lotta all'analfabetismo (il censimento del '51 registra una media nazionale poco sotto il 15%), la cultura come via maestra del progresso sociale e via dicendo. Scuola sì gentiliana ma di massa, dunque.

Il problema però, saranno le ricadute pratiche. Perché ormai siamo nella seconda metà degli anni '60 e il clima politico e culturale è cambiato. Nel periodo che va da qui alla fine degli anni '70 questa impostazione inclusivista sarà data anche agli interventi su scuola superiore (riforma del liceo con abolizione dell'esame dopo il biennio) ed università (con la caduta di tutte le preclusioni per iscriversi: in sostanza, qualsiasi scuola tu abbia fatto puoi entrare ovunque). Oltre alla temperie culturale, un ruolo decisivo in questo sarà giocato dai sindacati d'area, che in questi anni iniziano ad assumere il ruolo di governo-ombra del ministero e che - comprensibilmente, per carità - fanno il gioco della propria constituency. Aggiungere infine che l'ultima generazione ignorante (detto senza nessuna offesa, sia chiaro) in questi anni inizia ad avere figli in età scolare avanzata, vedere i quali diventare dottori per molti rappresenta l'obiettivo di una vita.

Questo, in brutale e perfettibile sintesi, è il quadro che porta alla situazione di oggi. Dove il sistema dell'istruzione ha un rapporto utenti su qualità vergognoso, il titolo di studio ha valore legale e si sfornano ogni anno migliaia di laureati in scienze di qualcosa che non solo non sanno un beato cazzo ma che alla società servono persino a meno di un beato cazzo e in compenso non si trova un perito chimico a pagarlo oro. 

Detto ciò, se esiste un sistema per disincentivare gente che col liceo avrebbe nulla a che vedere (quanto potrà mai essere draconiano e proibitivo questo benedetto test di ingresso?) dall'andarci lo stesso perché fa figo e, magari, a farla finire in altro tipo di istituto più adatto a loro e più in grado di dare loro sbocchi di una qualche utilità, benissimo venga.

About 80% of these measures were passed in the parliament a while ago *already*. It's this deposit raid which came as a surprise to *everybody* on top of everything else. The rumours of a deposit levy were thought to be just a bluff to get them to raise the corporate tax rate (which will be raised by 2.5% in this agreement).

The new president of Cyprus was elected recently with the mandate by the people to agree a bailout with the european partners based on austerity (exactly what was on the table at the time at least). He is the most pro-EU candidate and an ally to Angela Merkel via EPP. In fact she supported his candidacy before the election.

I'm guessing what the IMF really meant by 'austerity doesn't work' is that it takes too long to raise money with slashed spending and increased taxes -- why not just take the money you want now? :P

p.s. The president already pledged that he will never agree to a deposit levy and the finance minister openly called it an extremely stupid thing to do **before it became a real thing**. The fact is that Cyprus _never_ wanted the deposit levy -- it was forced on them. I was a supporter of the current president of Cyprus and I do not agree with this measure for the same reasons he pledged not to ever agree to such a thing about a week ago. Just under half of the voters were euroskeptic and an overwhelming majority have fond memories of the Cyprus Pound, even if they support the euro.

Obviously no measure is **the** relevant measure, but as I understand it debt/income is used as **a** relevant measure mostly for that reason.

In a bit more detail:

1. It measures the ability to service and/or pay off the loans (in a regular fashion, i.e. without everyone trying to sell their assets), and is thus used as the general measure for ""can we handle this burden year after year"". You could argue that one should use *interest*-to-income here instead, but in this way you get rid of variations in interest rates to get a more long term measure. Compare to government debt getting related to GDP.


2. Looking at debt-to-assets means you're using asset values *that are financed by the very debt you're trying to analyze*, basically relating the debt to itself. Such a measure would give little warning as to impending crashes or deflation risks.

true,Vaansinn,IREL,Ireland,"&gt;Your Democracy argument is invalid here, because the NPD itself is not in favour of pluralism. If they could they would ban most of the other parties.

It doesn't matter what the NPD thinks and what they would prefer. Fact is that we do have a Democracy and this is all that matters. Democracy also protects the rights of those that might not agree with it. You can't deny the rights to the NPD just because they would change it if they would be in charge.

&gt; It's difficult to ban the NPD, because the agency in charge of gathering proof (Verfassungsschutz) has either very close ties to the right wing scene or is just plain incompetent.

That is correct and is also one of the reasons why I don't think the ban will ever happen. 

&gt; The Party is currently in 2 or 3 state parliaments with some MPs, has a lot of ressources and actively converts teenagers to their crappy ideology.

The problem I have with this statement is: Let's assume we would get rid of the NPD and those kids wouldn't be converted to this ""crappy ideology"". What would stop them following another crappy ideology? 
I would much prefer the other parties to check what these kids actually want or what they are missing (other than a brain...hahah...joke) rather than taking them away the only ""political"" tool they know.

I have come across a few cases where leading parties cut funds for kindergardens and schools and guess who came to help them out? Correct. The NPD. The school didn't like it but they do need money and sponsors. After that everyone started complaining that the NPD is taking over in schools. But who is to blame here? The NPD trying to get a foot in the door ( and maybe actually want to help out struggling schools), the school for desperately accepting the money or the party who cuts the funds in the first place?

The point I am trying to make is that rather on focusing on how to ban something maybe we should look at what else we can offer people so they don't even join those parties. A ban on alcohol would't stop people from drinking and a ban for a party wouldn't stop people from thinking those crazy ideas.

A two tier Europe which includes scrapping much of the regulations for small and medium sized enterprises across Europe.  That in itself could allow the smaller, struggling states to regain real competitiveness and employment, manoeuvrability to swim in and out amongst the bigger fish.  With it, minimum employment law.  

The larger engineering bases will still be curtailed, the German and French worker unions are not going to allow an unnecessary degradation of the  working environment where I'd expect southern states now with smaller start ups would welcome it as something to build up from.

Some form of federalism for some states is inescapable now, certainly for some EZ states.  It shouldn't be forced as the only EU option; nor should any state not already in the Euro be obligated to join the Euro.  It should always have been a very exclusive club people were invited to, not compelled to join with membership.  The obstacles stopping Federalism from happening can all go away if the EU accepts that an outside tier comprised of a little more than a beefed up EEA based on trade and research/development is allowed to go ahead.

They should stop dismissing ideas that don't meet with a certain ideological mandarin vision of what Europe should become.  The reception David Cameron got, whether one agrees with him or not, when he both went to Europe for the emergency fiscal compact talks, and then again with his speech on Europe this year, was atrocious.

&gt;E-Mail	servicebuero@stadt-bad-harzburg.de

There you should try to find information about the one person named Straeck that we can see [here](http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/straeck.html). Explain them what it's about (to get sympathy and hopefuly avoid the fee). Also ask for any other suggestions they could make to help you.

* **Email/Facebook contact to different people in the area**

If you and your father would write something in your own words, asking for further assistance and information and with as much details as you want to offer in this first mail, I can translate it for you so you can contact them in german if you want. I'm also located in germany and am willing to help if you need that for anything.

**People you should also contact:**

**Tourist Information:** info@bad-harzburg.de (small chance but they might have contacts to the right people we couldn't find online)

**Facebook Group of Bad Harzburg:** https://www.facebook.com/KrodoHarzburg

**BdV Niedersachsen:**: info@bdv-lv-niedersachsen.de (asking for the **BdV Harzburg**, **Emil Schwab** or general help - keep in mind that this people emphasize on germans that had to flee after the war. This could make them a little difficult to handle but should also be a great motivation for them to help you.)

**Emil Schwab:** He is chairman of the local BdV and active in many relavant organisations. We have a phone number but no email. If the BdV won't help you finding him, you can try the local CDU (political party where he was active: [Website](http://www.cdu-badharzburg.de/) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CDU.BadHarzburg)) Note that he himself was displaced after ww2, I found a news article about that.

**--edit--** He is/was also active in the same church where the priest was murdered in Dachau: **St Georg in Bündheim** I couldn't find the contacts to this church but there is another catholic church nearby that should be able to help you: [Liebfrauen in Bad Harzburg
](http://www.katholische-kirche-nordharz.de/wie-wir-aufgestellt-sind/die-pfarrbueros/liebfrauen-in-bad-harzburg/)

**Mathilde M. Kleiber / Julius Kleiber (relative):** She's the chairman for the local historical association and he has to be related to her. If you don't want to use the phone number provided in my other post then contact him on facebook or [email](http://www.swingolfclub-harz.de/viewpage.php?page_id=43)

**Dieter Böhl:** Leading editor of the local newspaper, he should be able to help you with finding anyone you want and maybe they are interested in a little story. [His contacts](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1ajjuj/vet_wwii_bringback_looking_for_original_german/c8y7svy)

In any case, I'm on a Mac and my system language is American English.  I use OpenOffice with the language set to German and, after downloading the German language pack and setting the default document language to Austrian German, it worked OK... at least not as disastrous as what you describe.  It sounds to me like whatever you are using still wants to use the English dictionaries or worse, both simultaneously.  There are a number of places where you can set the *document* and *spell-checking* language, so you probably should look thoroughly (not only in the preferences but also in the document format as well as in the spell check dialog).  

I have found that Google apps, like Chrome &amp; Docs, have appallingly poor spell-checking for German. Worse, they occasionally &amp; mysteriously switch to random languages (silently!) when the spell-checker is set to ""automatic by language"".  Perhaps you are experiencing something similar.

Lastly I have purchased the Duden Korrektor Extension for OpenOffice.  While it is pretty helpful and works better than all the other built-in spell/grammar checking I have used before, it's not perfect or magical... much to my chagrin.

His parents that have returned to Turkey want their boy returned to them, but the Dutch Lesbian couple that provided a home for him has gone to ground.

I doubt if the 9 yr old kid wants to leave his parents who gave him a lot and go back to Turkey just because they are Lesbians and he didn't got exposure to Islamic cultural values.

true,Vaansinn,IREL,Ireland,"&gt;They control whole villages in some parts of the country and you won't get these places back, without getting rid of the Party, if you can get them back at all.

I think you can get them ""back"" (if by that you mean having these people vote for other parties) if they would have alternatives. And not just any other random alternative but a real one. Members of the NPD are quite ""down to earth"" in terms of having BBQ's, having family events and all sorts. You can tell the people in these villages all you want but by the end of the day it matters what you do. If your party shows up every 4 years for election you won't have a chance to get voters and turn people away from the NPD who's interacting with them all the time. You actually have to care and invest money and time in the community.

The NPD is only so strong depending on how much space you give them. Most big parties have abandoned villages and don't care about the working class or outsiders. It is no surprise that the NPD ""targets"" them. If you feel left alone you grasp for evey bit of social interaction you can get. And a common enemy makes easy friendships.

1. Non, c'est la première fois que j'entends ça. Par contre, j'ai déjà entendu tes arguments mille fois, et ils sont faux.
3.  La preuve :

&gt; Le fait est qu'en France, *il est très rare que les criminels aient des armes a feu.* Si les armes étaient en vente libre, tous les criminels en auraient.

Personne ne parle de vente libre, mais autorisé et reglementé, ce qui au passage est [déjà le cas en France](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contr%C3%B4le_des_armes_%C3%A0_feu_en_France#Les_armes_en_chiffres) : 

&gt;La France compterait légalement 762 331 armes soumises à autorisation (actuelles 1re et 4e catégories), et 2 039 726 armes soumises à déclaration.

Les criminels sont déjà très armés en France :
&gt;En 2009, il y aurait 12 à 20 millions d'armes qui circuleraient illégalement en France. [...] Ces chiffres prouvent les limites de la législation qui n'a aucun impact sur la criminalité organisée ; les criminels qui s'approvisionnent en armes sur le marché noir ne sont pas concernés par les lois qui réglementent le marché légal.

Ces chiffres tendraient plutôt à prouver le point de /u/Lrpt, avec lequel je suis en désaccord, mais pour [d'autres raisons](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1al4df/une_attaque_de_diligence_de_l%C3%A9poque_moderne/c8ygwl9).

However this usually does not extend down to grandchildren except in special cases that probably don't apply to you. (Spätaussiedler for example or descendants of German Jews or others that lost citizenship during the Nazi era.)  
However children (as long as they're minors) and spouses of a German citizen (your mother) can obtain German citizenship in order to enable families to move together. There are certain requirements for the children and spouses.

Overall you do not seem to have an automatic right to German citizenship in contrast to your mother. But even if you're not a minor anymore applying for it or at least getting information about the procedure would probably wise as the laws give a lot of room for decision to the authorities and courts so applicants get decided on individually based on many factors like a German address, length of stay in Germany, stable income, family or other ties to Germany etc.  
If you truly want to pursue this I advise you to get information from your local embassy or scrounging the web, it will probably not be as easy as it would be for your mom but your German heritage gives you an advantage compared to someone without any German ties.

This is very important because it prevents the actual goverment from banning unwanted parties. With all the Verfassungsschutz assets in the ranks of the NPD it is very difficult for the court to tell what actions were done by actual NPD members and what actions were done by assets to  discredit the NPD. 

Yes, it is hard to proof that the NPD is unconstitutional because they wont be so stupid to write ""Yeah, kill the Jews"" on their homepage. Officially, they are against too much immigration, against the Euro, and for stronger support for families. Everyone knows that they are, but we cant ban a party without hard proof, that would be problematic in a democracy.

Another thing that people should think about is: What happens after they are banned? These people will not disappear into thin air, they are still there and they have still an organisation, but now they are in the underground, out of the eye, out of the mind.

Exactly. The Euro should be re-done, and a lot of country should leave.

The sacrifice to bail out their country on **these** terms. To pose the question: ""You either agree with these terms and make a sacrifice, or don't, and you are out of the Eurozone"" is a false dillema. It is baseless to say that the Cypriots refuse to make any sacrifices to bail out their country, by refusing these terms. 

Many analysts (some of them Cypriot) have regarded this plan as destructive or short-sighted. Maybe the Cypriots are willing to make some more reasonable sacrifices.

Forcing a dillema such as the one mentioned above, is hardly the basis on which the eurozone should be founded upon anyway. 

&gt;I think that rejecting this plan will lead to one of the following:
they go bankrupt

Maybe, or they get a 6bn Euro loan from elsewhere.

&gt;they accept the plan a few weeks from now

The exact same plan won't reach the parliament again, since it has been shot down. But it is very likely that they will agree to a renegotiated, altered plan.

I don't think anyone would have been traveling around with something like that so late during the war so it could very well come from an old mansion. It's an double barrel hunting rifle I would say? Have you tried to identify the marks on it and get some further information?

It won't be legal/easy to give back a working gun, even without the firing pin. There are certain requirements and changes that have to be made with the gun in order for it to become a decorative weapon. These have to be certified with the ""Beschussamt"" (gun control office) so you would have to send it to them and not directly to a descendant.

This will take time and cost money but on the other side it's an good argument to have time and check the potential receiver. This will also not be very easy. In my experience I would say that in nearly all families the role of relatives during the war has not been fully discussed. Especially 2 or 3 generations later this can be very hard to judge, even if you are open minded about it and try to research your own family history. There is just so much that never has been told and every family claims that it was war and nobody had a choice and ""he was just an ordinary soldier fighting for his country"" and then they will start to talk about them returning from POW (or not)... You get the idea... The Straecks you might find today may know as much about their relatives as you do about your great uncle and what he did in this war.

To get a clear picture of this family and what they did will be pretty hard for you to optain from so far away and under the circumstances, so I wouldn't expect too much.
