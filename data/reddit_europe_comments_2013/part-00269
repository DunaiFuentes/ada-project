Im not from Spain and Im far from fluent in Spanish, but I got my BA in Latin American studies and know enough of it that I had kind of planned to get a job as an interpreter.  I would caution you that being an interpreter for the 2nd most popular language in the USA comes with some difficult limitations.  Sure, there is a lot of need for people who speak Spanish to sell cars and telemarket and work one of the lines at the DMV.  For anything beyond that you really have to invest yourself in degrees, certifications and good luck.  They arent really hurting for people who speak Spanish at the UN or on Wall Street.

Its not all that bad. I know several people who work in immigration law (luckily lots of hispanohablantes want to live in the USA) but no one who got any further than that.  The worst thing is that so many people grow up bilingual in America that its not hard to find someone who can speak it *well enough* to do the job.  

Likewise, if you want to live and work in the USA later then you should think about the realistic benefits of going to an American University.  Im not saying school in Spain is inferior, but that there is a definite relationship between going to school and getting a job in the USA.  There will likely be fewer resources to help you find a job in Spain than in most American universities.  

My advice, study another language while you are there.  Take an Arabic class in Spanish.  Take a German class in Spanish.  Generally try to avoid Romance languages because again, there are already plenty of people who speak them.  Well, you solicited advice and I gave what I could.

Also took French and ASL in high school but I can't really say I'm proficient in those last two). Taking another language while I'm in Spain actually sounds like a really good idea, I might take you up on that advice.

I have looked at graduate schools here in the US, and I am applying to 3, but I would like to study in Spain for the experience, to improve my language skills, and to have time in a Spanish speaking country on my resume. In the end it will probably come down to the money--whichever school gives me the best financial aid package will probably be where I end up going, regardless of which country it's in.

As far as being prepared for a job, the schools I'm looking at attempt to give you a more specialized vocabulary to make it easier to find a job (ie legal vocabulary so you could become a court interpreter, medical vocabular so you could become a medical interpreter, and so on).  And I'm not just looking into interpretation, I'm also open to translation.  I'm actually doing a translation project for an internship now, getting paid to translate a Cuban play from Spanish to English.  Of course, I'm not sure how easy such projects are to come by (I had a professor help me find this one), but I do at least have a little bit of flexibility.  I also know several fellow students who have translated web pages for paid internships, and one who translated a Portuguese collection of poems into English. So perhaps translation work is easier to find than interpretation?  I can only think of one person I know who has done interpretation, and she works for an organization that helps immigrants learn English and study for citizenship exams.

I'm not sure where I want to live and work down the road.  I would be willing to stay in Spain if I found a job there, but I'm not sure I will be able to.

Her sister also spoke English to me. Maybe that was a big mistake. However, I still learned good German. I also went to the Volkshochschule to take the required Integration course. And there is when it all happened.

I remember sitting in class, the teacher asked me in German what this was. It was a picture of a chicken. I remember blurting out oh thats a Gegagle! Thats the swabian word for chicken.

Then she said, thats not right! Thats swabian and not high german!
I remember, I never knew hänhchen up till that point.
Another time she asked me, what mineral wasser was, and I told her the swabian word being Sprudel! And for the longest even more than chicken I never knew that wasnt high german.

Then before even realizing it, I started to say my st sounds in German into sch. I didnt even realize how swabian I was becoming. Not that is was a bad thing. I was still American, still am. But how my foreign german was also becoming partially swabianized.

They tried to teach me High German, and I refused to be part of the German collective. I spoke like a true Swabian.

Then although generally you dont write swabian. I mean my wife writes it, and our family and friends write if we like talk on facebook or whatsapp or something, but generally you don twrite it. Sure there are dictionarys you can buy where someone has written it down.

I began to write it in school. But here in swabian land, the dialect is actually important to know it. i never understand why they dont teach ua  bit. Most people arent moving all over germany. Sure teaching High German is smart, but through in a few local words.

No foreigner I met besides me here, or in my class, knew what a weckle is. For example sometimes on a sign outside a butcher they write LKW 1,50 Euro. Auslanders dont know what this is?

&gt; una proposta per il cosiddetto capacity payment, vale a dire quella sorta di sovvenzione pubblica alle centrali elettriche per garantire la capacità di funzionamento. È un tema che riguarda le centrali a gas (tutte e quattro quelle di Sorgenia **†**) che, a causa del meccanismo che prevede la priorità nel dispacciamento di energia da fonti rinnovabili, rischiano di restare ferme o di funzionare poco o niente. Ebbene, a fronte di tale rischio (che è poi il principale motivo per cui Sorgenia è in profondo rosso **††** ), Sorgenia chiede di sovvenzionare la disponibilità della centrale, senza la quale il Paese rischia di restare al buio nei momenti in cui le rinnovabili non bastano a soddisfare i picchi di domanda **†††** . Ora, essendo la capacità installata di Sorgenia pari a 3.200 megawatt, ed essendo il capacity payment stimato in 25-35mila euro al megawatt, la sovvenzione potrebbe valere per Sorgenia circa 100 milioni **††††** .
&gt;Va detto che oltre alla società della Cir, sono interessati al provvedimento anche Enel e A2a. E pure che le sovvenzioni al gas arriverebbero dopo quelle già esistenti per le rinnovabili, che ci costano 12 miliardi **†††††** . In ogni caso Sorgenia è la più interessata perché sia Enel sia A2a hanno modi di diversificare significativamente i ricavi **††††††** , mentre le quattro centrali dei De Benedetti a Termoli, Modugno, Turano ed Aprilia funzionano tutte a gas.

†Tutto il parco di generazione italiano è basato sul gas, anche Sorgenia ok, ma non solo Sorgenia. Inoltre sorgenia è proprietaria di una bella fetta della generazione fotovoltaica distribuita e agricola.

††No. Altrimenti lo sarebbero tutte le aziende del settore energetico tradizionale, condizionate invece dal mostruoso calo dei consumi in Italia. 

†††Non lo chiede Sorgenia, lo chiedono tutte le associazioni di categoria del settore elettrico. Anche Paolo Berlusconi. 

††††Solo se Sorgenia garantirà la riserva calda. Come il CP sarà distribuito non è ancora chiaro.

††††† 10, secondo il contatore GSE. 12 è il tetto massimo. Dopodichè non ci saranno più incentivi alle rinnovabili

In a time of austerity this man squeezes millions from Portuguese citizens and steadily raises energy prices, commits many irregularities and even causes the tumbling of ministers and secretaries of state.

It was by EU orders that want the states to have no participation in companies... And they sell it to China's Three Gorges! A Chinese state controlled company. The stupidity, corruption and complete defeat of the original argument is incredible.


He's also able to intimidate the state into continuously fund EDP with tax breaks subsidies and other forms of steady income. I repeat, he does it in times of brutal austerity.

Quello che il M5S sta facendo è quello che i giornali dovrebbero fare di dovere: riportare i fatti per come stanno. Ma siccome la stampa è stumento politico, ora gli italiani trovano scomoda la verità delle cose, cioè che la corruzzione e la perniciosità del sistema politico è peggiore di quella percepita.

E' palese che gli italiani non vogliano consegnare il paese a Grillo, perchè la maggior parte degli elettori, destra e sinistra, è composto da gente che ha la stessa mentalità dei politici; non capisce il vero bisogno di questo paese. Le primarie del PD sono state affollate non dai giovani, ma da gente che era vicino all'età pensionabile; questo deve farti capire come troppi cittadini non abbiano ancora capito cosa stia accadendo. Gli italiani leggono sempre i soliti giornali e rimasticano sempre le solite notizie dalle solite fonti; se provassero ad usare mezzi alternativi di informazione, capirebbero che la musica è differente.

Gli italiani preferiscono affondare questa nazione votando sempre gli stessi partiti,  piuttosto che rischiare di cambiare con Grillo o altre forze. E' pericoloso pensare così, perchè chi continua a dare la fiducia al PD o al PDL non ha bene chiara la situazione dell'Italia, e in contraddizione continua a lamentarsi; il tutto non ha senso.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;It's also some of those big corporations that made food and goods are available as they are today. Back when countries where more isolated and mom and pop stores where the norm, you also had more people living shitty lives.

No, the development of society as a whole made that possible. Corporations are just a small part of that, and even that small part isn't unambiguously positive. And how does being a food and goods producer make you the right source of social and migration policy?

&gt;I'm not saying that corporations can't be downright abusive, I'm just saying it's childish to use them as universal bogeymen.

I'm just using them in this particular case. Big business has been one of the few voices that's always in favor of more migration. Two sentences later they say: ""there's so much unemployment, obviously our taxes are too high!"".

&gt;But one can see that less restrictive ones (like Canada, Sweden) don't fare worse than more restrictive ones (Japan, Denmark). And by that I was pointing out to the fact that it's better to be significantly less restrictive, since by restrictions you're just hurting the immigrants.

Most third world countries don't have effective border controls. It does them a lot of good.

&gt;And by this you're telling me that it's alright to send back the still-quite-poor-but-not-yet-beggars (i.e. the ones that managed to get to your country by selling their life's savings on the hope of a better life) back?

It's okay because we have to keep our own house in order. I want to maintain certain standards of rights and benefits. If the number of migrants doubles, I'm not able to double the budgets needed to support them so the standards will drop. I don't want that. In addition, it doesn't solve the problem in their countries of origin, they get to be second-rate citizens, and it stimulates a backlash against migration and racist movements.

&gt;Except it's not labor pretty college educated white people (yes still unemployable) like doing.

They're not the unemployed ones. The unemployment is mostly people who have a limited education... much like fresh immigrants.

&gt;Closing the borders never fixed the economy of a country. But close your borders -- and you'll see that it will be the pretty white people that will much rather emigrate to be accountants in New Zealand rather than be dishwashers in Zeeland.

How is this relevant?

&gt;I'm the one who wants to make them citizens (just in case I wasn't direct enough).

No, you say that they have to do menial labor with limited rights until maybe later they can enjoy full citizenship.

&gt;And I'm the one who wants to give them the better life they want as well, the life they want.

Too bad reality has a mind of its own, and doesn't just do what you want. Good intentions never gave someone a job.

&gt;As for class of maids and servants, look at how maidey and servanty asians living in Vancouver are nowdays. Or Italians living in New York. Or all those bajillion people of Irish descent all over the US. 

They migrated to a country that had an actual shortage of people for jobs in an expanding economy, with permission of the country, while migration was restricted. Sure, that can work. Meanwhile, the numerous illegals are stuck in the underclass.

&gt;Fuck, I just supervised a college exam for people that will probably end up being medics, and nearly half of them were such immigrants whom apparently aren't destined to be maids for the Herrenvolk.

Medics are qualified and therefore will be able to gain entrance anyway. What you propose is to let those who fail the medic exams come anyway.

&gt;Remember, the Nazi's themselves where rather big on isolationism and prioritizing their own.

I'm not prioritizing my own, I'm prioritizing the immigrants we already let in and who still suffer a 50% unemployment rate in some cities. If it didn't work last time, we're going to try and find out what the problems are and fix them before the next round of immigration.

&gt;Remember, the Nazi's themselves where rather big on isolationism and prioritizing their own. At least read the Cliffnotes version of National Socialism before you start calling people literally Hitler.

Take your own advice.

&gt;Break what things? The soothing background noise of people not speaking foreign languages?

As I explained, lowering labor standards and overtaxing public services. Supply and demand 101.

&gt;A hypocrite for wanting to give millions a better life? You're the one who'd send North Koreans back to Kim Jong Un's prisoner camps.

North Koreans still are eligible for political refugee status. You won't give them a better life, there'll just be longer lines in the unemployment office.

true,JohnOO,null,null,"I lived around Siegen for close to 6 years. A funny place as it is about halfway between Cologne and Frankfurt and couldn't be more different from both cities. It used to be a big centre for iron works, there are still some massive factories around, but the old drawings of the town from years gone by show it would have been perfectly at home in the Ruhrgebiet. The locals can appear very cold, distant and almost impossible to get to know. My ex was a local, so I had a way in to get behind the ""front"" they have (this is at its most pronounced in the Siegerland, take them outside of the area to Cologne, for example, and they open up and become very different people). Alcohol also helps to get them to talk, they are great fans of parties, but overall they are a very closed bunch. The local traditions aren't so obvious, I could be uncharitable and say complaining is a local past time (in particular among those who were over 60), or that taking up 2 seats in a bus as their shopping bags are more important than your fellow man (again most common among the over 60s), or going crazy at Lidl or Aldi over the new offers is something quite a lot of them live for (Black Friday in the US has little on the madness experienced trying to look at special offers in the local Lidl each Tuesday or Thursday morning). There are local traditions, but very few of those in their 20s or 30s seem interested in them. I kno there is meant to be a type of creature that lives in the forests, but small kids and people off their heads on booze/drugs are the ones who believe in them.
The common perception of the area from people in Cologne is that the Siegerlanders are unfriendly, have very stunted family trees, and love potatoes.

I could welcome both Turkey and Israel in the EU once they'd get their houses in order, Iran is basically a somewhat distant and very theocratic dictatorship, N. Korea a vicious, insane dictatorship, Pakistan is almost a failed state (by the way, we are already half-way round the world so our geopolitical interests start to diverge too much already, even if no other reasons were present), China is a) huge, so we'd never really be equal partners unless we'd split up China into its provinces but even then b) it'll still be an oriental culture fairly different from our own and c) a dictatorship. The US is also too big on its own *and* their geopolitical interests differ from ours a lot because they are far away from here. But even I would like to form a union with them – I doubt they would, seeing as they can nicely influence us to do their bidding without us really being able to do the reverse.

So yeah, I think comparing your fellow Europeans to these mostly developing countries is pretty nasty *and* frankly either intellectually dishonest or stupid.

As for the Swiss, Norwegians and Icelanders: this is harder to tell because their debates about the EU are not as lively as yours so I can't really say for sure what the general tone is. That said, I still think it's bad for them to be outside because they have no representation at the decision-making yet they follow, whether they like it or not, the overwhelming majority of EU legislation. It's just undemocratic and just an illusion of independence.

It could be good for the rEU because it might be able to integrate faster, it could be bad for the rEU because 60m north-ish people left and took their representatives, voting habits and culture with them. So in the end, the EU might shift further away from British interests. That's bad because sovereignty in the 21st century has been eroded. Countries are more interconnected than ever and larger ones dominate smaller ones, sometimes openly, sometimes more behind the scenes. The Norwegian Prime Minister Stoltenberg called his own country a fax democracy because that's how he is regularly informed about his country's new laws. Does that sound sovereign to you? Because that's how it's going to be. Probably worse because your politicians have managed to piss off quite a few continentals already, so who knows what deal the UK will get when all is said and done.

Really, one link to a proper study will save you 10 sentences blabbing about how letting immigrants in is literally being Hitler and giving them healthcare and education is just unreasonable as fuck.

Look at this shit for instance:

&gt;&gt; Remember, the Nazi's themselves where rather big on isolationism and prioritizing their own. At least read the Cliffnotes version of National Socialism before you start calling people literally Hitler.

&gt;Take your own advice.

Are you trolling? Am I the one who started dropping Nazi references all over the place? I am the one who by any means advocates a policy that is both national and socialist at the same time? Dude, really, if you're not willing to have a damn dialogue then why write all these wall of text? Just go back home and listen to your Geert Wilders youtube speeches, if that's what you're into.

&gt; And how does being a food and goods producer make you the right source of social and migration policy?

You pay taxes, you contribute to society way more than your man commenting on reddit. You want to hire the immigrant, the immigrant wants to be hired, the only one complaining is silverionmox who wants to be paid 10 times more as that brown person and do 10 times less work. And why should I, the Dutch owner of that factory hire him? Camaraderie? There's a reason small corner stores that would hire you started being replaced by franchised stores -- they're just better and more efficient.

&gt; As I explained, lowering labor standards and overtaxing public services. Supply and demand 101.

Yet mysteriously the quality of life seems to be increasing continuously, both for the said underclass and the citizens of your own country that finally have access to services that should be affordable unless you artificially inflate the price of that work. You might not like that the laptop you write your isolationist views on was made in Taiwan, but the Chinese sure like the skyrocketting quality of life. And in the end whose quality of life decreased anyway? Yes, you have higher unemployment rates. But then again if you check _any_ data from the 80s to the present day, all life quality factors have increased. Lifespan, education, take your pick.

&gt; Medics are qualified and therefore will be able to gain entrance anyway.

I like it how you just read one word in an entire phrase. These weren't medics. These where brown people, immigrants and descendants of immigrants studying to become medics. People **you** would have packed back home. Medical diplomas from various non-EU and non-developed world countries aren't necessarily recognized within the EU.

&gt; with permission of the country, while migration was restricted

That restricted part is a bit relative. I'm quite sure that in the early 20th century forced repatriations where way less commonplace than nowdays. 

&gt; Sure, that can work. Meanwhile, the numerous illegals are stuck in the underclass.

That's because they might be _illegals_? *nudge nudge wink wink*

&gt; You won't give them a better life, there'll just be longer lines in the unemployment office. Explain me how all these unqualified migrants will be finding jobs where the previous ones didn't? By doing each other's laundry?

Correction. The EU DOES have the power to negotiate and conclude treaties in the matters where it has EXCLUSIVE COMPETENCE. One of them is external trade, since we are in a Custom Union. For that reason, the EU participates to WTO rounds of negotiations.

However, the EP's power in this regard is weaker than the one of the Commission and the Council.

Compared to other regions of Germany, Beer is not the official libation of this area.

The most popular things to eat are Grüne-Soße (Grie Soß) which is  a herb based green sauce, which is eaten w potatoes, w Schnitzel (Frankfurter Schnitzel) and a cheese called Handkäse, which is like a sour milk cheese, and tastes quite good once you get used to it. It is somehow a fact, that green sauce was Goethe's favorite food. Also yea, GOethe was born here, he's the original Frankfurter Bub

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Sigh

Dude, why the sigh? If you are not enjoying this debate, or think my arguments are somehow tiresome, no need to get involved. I'm trying to argue from an entirely bona fide perspective. It should not be tiring or annoying to be challenged, you should welcome it! The reason why I post here is because I believe that people can have differences of opinion but still be friends, and still be bona fide. Dissenting opinions are to be welcomed.

&gt; So yeah, I think comparing your fellow Europeans to these mostly developing countries is pretty nasty and frankly either intellectually dishonest or stupid.

I do wish EUphiles would not call EUsceptics things like nasty, intellectually dishonest and stupid. The reason I asked the question is because you ealier asserted that UKIP, in not wanting to be in a union with European countries, is nasty. Therefore I thought it would be worth finding out if you thought that there were any countries out there that you did not want your country to enter into a union with, to show that there could be reasons other than nastiness and so I picked a list of countries at random. I thought this might show you that UKIP, in wanting to leave the EU, is not motivated by nastiness.

It turns out that one of the reasons you do not want to be in a union with China is because of their cultural differences with Europeans. That's fine - I think it is a valid reason, I don't think it is nasty. Cultural differences is one of the reasons why I don't want UK to be in the EU. And yet, somehow, I am nasty for holding this position and also nasty for even asking you why you don't want to be in a union with China?!  

It also seems to be the case that you accept that on principle that there might be Icelanders and Norwegians who don't want to be part of the EU for reasons other than nastiness. Therefore I think you should accept on principle that this might be the case for the UK too. To indicate that a British person for not wanting to be part of the EU is nasty is a bit insulting.  

&gt; The Norwegian Prime Minister Stoltenberg called his own country a fax democracy because that's how he is regularly informed about his country's new laws. Does that sound sovereign to you? Because that's how it's going to be. Probably worse because your politicians have managed to piss off quite a few continentals already, so who knows what deal the UK will get when all is said and done.

We'll see what deal Britain gets when it leaves, that's up for negotiation. I agree with you that there will be an element within the EU that will not want to give the UK a good deal on leaving, that is geopolitics for you. There will be other parts of the EU that will want to be much more pragmatic. 

It is very clear that the rEU cannot really work out how it sees the Brits, on the one hand they want us to stay in the EU because we are ""north-ish people with their north-ish voting habits and culture"" but on the otherhand ""our politicians piss them off"". Personally I see these two things as two sides of the same coin. I think it is great for the EU that there is a voice of opposition in debates and that there is a nation that says loudly and clearly once in a while, ""hold on, is this such a good idea?"". I suppose partly I think that because the whole concept of justice and democracy and learning in the UK is adversarial - in our court rooms and in our houses of parliament and in our universities and in our newspapers, we love the rough and tumble of debate. Legislation and justice in the UK is never consensus-based, but always opposition-based. Thus, when the UK challenges something in the EU, we always think we are being helpful because a good justice process and a good legislative process (in the eyes of the UK) involves heavy scrutiny and opposition. We're trying to argue from an entirely bona fide perspective. It should not be tiring or annoying to be challenged, you should welcome it! We believe that people can have differences of opinion but still be friends, and still be bona fide. Dissenting opinions are to be welcomed.

We'll see where the chips fall and we'll be happy with it in any case I am sure and also be happy with however our dear friends on the continent proceed. Hopefully you will be happy for us too, when we leave!

So erklärt sich auch die lange Verzögerung bis die Wirkung eintritt. NMDA Antagonisten haben den gleichen Effekt, nur eben direkter.

Ich denke du sprichst einen wichtigen Punkt an, es gibt schon lange wirksame Stoffe, aber aus bürokratischen, finanziellen und legalen Gründen können und werden sie nicht zum Einsatz kommen. So könnte MDMA in Verbindung mit einigen wenigen Therapiesitzungen eine der wirksamsten Lösung für posttraumatische Belastungsstörungen sein, und dass LSD und Psilocybin wichtige Werkzeuge für Therapeuten sind, wenn sie denn legal wären und damit Forschung betrieben werden dürfte, ist auch seit schon 50 Jahren bekannt.

So sind Pharmakonzerne eben primär profitorientiert, und wenn man den Gedanken etwas paranoid weiterdenkt auch nicht unbedingt immer daran interessiert dass der Einzelne gesund wird, da ein gesunder Patient keine Einnahmen bringt. Siehe die groteske Anzahl an Amphetamin- und Opiatrezepten in den USA, wo viele Ärzte auch nicht mehr sind als Dealer in weissen Kitteln.

Das lässt sich in gewisser, abgeschwächter Art auch auf Antidepressiva hierzulande übertragen.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Really, one link to a proper study will save you 10 sentences blabbing about how letting immigrants in is literally being Hitler and giving them healthcare and education is just unreasonable as fuck.

You hypocrite, this is what you said: ""Well, they work, they pay taxes from which you the citizen get benefits. After a few years of doing that, they could be given the right to vote and the security that comes with being a citizen of the country"". You're denying those people political rights and social security. I am well aware that the neither job offers nor the social security budgets are unlimited; as a consequence, neither are migration permits. You live in a fantasy land where a stamp on your passport somehow makes jobs and schools materialize out of thin air.

&gt;You pay taxes, you contribute to society way more than your man commenting on reddit. You want to hire the immigrant, the immigrant wants to be hired, the only one complaining is silverionmox who wants to be paid 10 times more as that brown person and do 10 times less work. And why should I, the Dutch owner of that factory hire him? Camaraderie?

What are you ranting about? Do you even know it yourself?

&gt;There's a reason small corner stores that would hire you started being replaced by franchised stores -- they're just better and more efficient.

The result still is that less people are employed in worse conditions and the profit is siphoned off to some fiscal paradise god knows where. I don't see why I should be so happy about that... and still not why that also makes them qualified to dictate social and migration policy. I have a good plumber but I still don't let him give my financial advice.

&gt;Yet mysteriously the quality of life seems to be increasing continuously, both for the said underclass and the citizens of your own country that finally have access to services that should be affordable unless you artificially inflate the price of that work.

What, ""mysteriously""? We have migration restrictions now. And what do you think will happen to quality of life when you make the ""artificially inflate the price of work drop"", i.e. cut wages and fire people?

&gt; but the Chinese sure like the skyrocketting quality of life.

The Chinese have a restrictive immigration policy. If you think life is better in China, please try to get in. Don't get shot. http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/02/rising-protests-in-china/100247/
http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1272959/under-chinas-new-immigration-law-harsher-fines-illegal-foreigners

&gt;But then again if you check any data from the 80s to the present day, all life quality factors have increased.

As you said, there are migration restrictions anywhere, so how does that support your point?

&gt;I like it how you just read one word in an entire phrase. These weren't medics. These where brown people, immigrants and descendants of immigrants studying to become medics. People you would have packed back home. 

No, I'm perfectly alright with allowing people to study here to practice a profession they will be succesful in because there's a shortage.

&gt;Medical diplomas from various non-EU and non-developed world countries aren't necessarily recognized within the EU.

For good reason: the quality is less. Though we should give them preference for student visa since they'll be able to update their education much faster than someone learning from scratch.

&gt;That's because they might be illegals? nudge nudge wink wink

And are therefore limited to the dirty work you claim is a guaranteed parth to prosperity.

&gt;Just google North Korea. Them doing your laundry. Just ask yourself: why don't the jobless immigrants leave? They don't even leave while given cash incentives in Denmark. Really, answer that question.

That's the whole point: the position of the Church is such that it doesn't define morality anymore in society: it's open for debate in the public area. With such a high percentage of people who give Sharia precedence over secular law, that is not compatible.

I work at a big research institute. I have colleagues from all over the world, even though most of them are from Europe. We have no language barrier because we all speak English, even when we go out as friends. We have no class divide, because we all have similar backgrounds; we are after all all university educated people in the same field. What I've learned from this: the differences between different people in Europe is not bigger than the difference between different people from individual countries. It's natural. We have closely related histories with prolonged contact, our countries are of similar geography and close to each other. Sure, I will not know some of your lullabies or ancient pieces of literature. But, the ways we organise our lives are similar, the way we organise our communities. People from completely different places tend, however, to have significantly different outlooks on life.

For some reason, and I blame your success in spreading the English language, quite a few Britons tend to see us as more foreign than we see you because for us it's easier to look into the UK and see what's going on. And what we see is the same stuff we see at home. You look to us and tend to understand less so we appear more foreign than some people half-way around the world who do share your language and history up to a certain point. But, their fates diverged from yours a long time ago.

As for your little lecture on dissenting opinions: that's exactly what I'm talking about. You think this is different from, say for instance, Germany? Not at all! We're known around the globe for telling others our opinions, even if they might offend them. We don't even [sugar-coat it like you might](http://tinoseeber.de/wp-content/uploads/Brits-say-and-mean.gif).

And just so you don't misunderstand me, I don't argue for melting everything into one homogeneous mass. I like my Bavarian breakfast and sometimes I like an English one, thank you very much. But we can and should recognise that we have a lot in common that we can use to build upon to face the challenges of a multipolar world together for the benefit of all of us.

PS: Both Norway and Iceland have reservations about the common fisheries policy. Considering the shitty state it's in, I can hardly blame them. Though I'd wish they'd join simply to make it easier to outvote those that want to keep the status quo. That said, they're both more integrated than the UK in some regards, i.e. Schengen. Even though the UK is nominally a EU member, I like to think that membership in the borderless area is more a sign of togetherness than letting foreign ships ravage your fishing grounds.",0,1386850496,null,0,false,0,cdzxltn,t3_1smhrd,t1_cdzxltn,t1_cdzwudh,null,1428257734,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,tanadrin,null,null,"Cultural unification can substitute for political unification (and in the case of German, there was a sense of a unified German cultural nation centuries before there was a state with the name ""Germany""), but it still results in the selection of an abitrary dialect, even if that dialect is partly manufactured (as it was in the case of both English and German). Hochdeutsch didn't develop in a totally straightforward fashion, either--different pushes toward standardization incorporated different regionalisms, though the overall approximation tended toward southerly varietes of German historically.

My point is that viewing languages as unitary constructs with stable, standard centers, and unstable dialects which ultimately derive from the central standard is ahistorical and unscientific. Standard forms aren't structurally or systematically different from ""dialect"" forms, even when they're influenced by an attempt to paper over dialectical differences, and there's no criterion one can use to systematically identify a dialect verses a language. Not to mention, many languages, especially minority languages, don't *have* standard forms. Are they nothing but a loose collection of dialects? Dutch and German regional dialects also blend smoothly into one another in northern and northwestern Germany, forming what's called a dialect continuum. Does that mean Dutch is a dialect of German? Or German is a dialect of Dutch? Of course not.

&gt;is making a big effort not to let the dialect drift away from the rest of the German language in order to stay part of a larger language community

There's a misunderstanding often in lay circles about the ability of language regulators to influence how language is used. In short, they can't: legislated language regulation has no significant effect on how people actually use their language, and all the efforts of the Académie Française in the world don't suffice to actually control how French-speakers use their language in a daily environment. There's no ""letting"" a dialect do anything: languages are constantly in a state of flux, and though large-scale social trends can influence how that evolution occurs (sometimes profoundly), these are forces much greater than the machinations of regional authorities.

And plenty of small languages are ""useless"" insofar as they're not major global languages; that doesn't make them uninteresting, or, indeed, useless to the people who *do* speak them. Language is an important part of culture and self-expression, and sometimes, their very regionality can be a source of pride for speakers: *we* talk this way, and nobody else does.

No, I'm giving them way more rights than they are given now, and want to make it way easier for them to become full citizens. You're the one pissing his pants when he heard about giving them health care, and you want to expatriate them en masse back to Sudan, Pakistan, Somalia and other such lovely paradises.

I know this puts that handful of neurons of your to work, but we are debating different aspects of the immigration issue. You where blurting out the fact that cheap labor is inextricably linked to a lowering of the standard of life, which I pointed out to you -- is false. It's amazing how the only time you point to sources you're doing it while derailing from the main issue.

&gt; No, I'm perfectly alright with allowing people to study here to practice a profession they will be succesful in because there's a shortage.

Pro tip: if you're going to blurt out whatever idiotic statements happen to cross that vacuum you sport in your cranial cavity, at least make sure those statements aren't contradictory. 
2^nd pro tip: all caps are almost always a bad idea.

&gt; For good reason: the quality is less. 

Red herring + shoddy grammar

&gt; And are therefore limited to the dirty work you claim is a guaranteed parth to prosperity.

IF given the right and an easy way of becoming full citizens. That _IF_ is quite crucial, yet you just intentionally brush over it in your little diatribes where you call me a Nazi for wanting to give people asylum and a chance at a better life.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; The German greens have always confused me. How can they prefer coal with the massive CO2 emissions to nuclear?

They don't. The anti-nuclear crowd certainly was at the core of the original Green movement, but even in the early days of the Greens in Germany a decently sized part of the party were more concerned with other matters, and neither is the anti-nuclear sentiment in Germany limited to the Greens.

It's not seen as a choice between nuclear and coal, but as one between nuclear and renewables (and energy efficiency) as the replacement for coal. And the Greens have been tremendously successful at making renewables a much more viable alternative than they would have otherwise been. This is somewhat less true for wind, where a lot has been done in other countries, particularly Denmark, but photovoltaics most definitely owes a lot to them. A third of the global install base is in Germany, and not long ago it even was one half (although, at one point Germany used to have a third of global wind capacity as well). Feed-in-tariffs have since been adopted all over the world, even China has them. This is what helped the industry grow, to get to scale and build up a supply chain.

Speaking at the London School of Economics, where he teaches, Professor Pissarides will say: “The euro should either be dismantled in an orderly way or the leading members should do the necessary as fast as possible to make it growth and employment-friendly,.
“We will get nowhere plodding along with the current line of ad hoc decision-making and inconsistent debt-relief policies.
“The policies pursued now to steady the euro are costing Europe jobs and they are creating a lost generation of educated young people. This is not what the founding fathers promised.” 

So, no, he is not arguing for the abandonment of the euro but calls for 
""action () needed to restore the euro’s credibility in international markets and the trust that Europe’s nations once had in each other”.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  Is it ""only"" (not really appropriate here but I can't find a better way) because of the risks of accident and Fukushima's recent catastrophe?

No, it's just as much about storage, and seeing renewables as a viable alternative. Regarding Fukushima, especially the foreign press often portraits this as the trigger, but this is far from true. Germany had decided to phase out nuclear a decade before. Merkel's government then gave the operators an extension to their license merely half a year before Fukushima, only to revert the decision when the accident happened. So, it was an ""exit from the exit of the exit"".

Fukushima exemplifies the concern, though. From an engineering perspective, nuclear power plants can be safe to an all but absolute degree. The problems emerge when you add the operators to the equation. TEPCO knew the tsunami wall wasn't high enough, it just seemed like an acceptable risk compared to the cost of increasing its height.  
The German operators have repeatedly shown a similar behaviour. Nuclear power plants owe much of their theoretical safety to redundancies and investigation of causes when protocols or one of the systems fail. But from the perspective of an operator's management, those are cost factors. When your multi-billion investment has to go off-line while an incident is being investigated, it has a very direct effect on your balance sheet, but a small increase of an otherwise negligible risk is very unlikely to have any consequences. So, the instinct is to neglect to inform the authorities and cover it up, and the existing anti-nuclear sentiment turns this into a feed-back-loop to avoid negative PR.  
Probably the most cynical case happened right during the Chernobyl accident, when the operator of a thorium pebble bed reactor thought it could get away with an incident because the leakage would be covered by the radiation from Chernobyl. This didn't even lead to the plant getting shut down, it remained in operation for years until the constant cost-overruns due to repeated other malfunctions became just too expensive. There are other, although less severe, examples of similar behaviour. 

The pattern continues with storage. There's a storage site in a salt mine, where studies that had raised concerns were simply ignored. The latest state is that the government has decided that the stored waste has to be removed, but it's uncertain whether the structural integrity will hold up long enough to complete the process. This was supposed to be a long term storage site.

If the industry had intentionally tried to get the public against them, they couldn't have done a better job. Renewables are seen as a viable alternative, without those risks. ",0,1386855286,null,0,false,0,cdzyjef,t3_1spf2d,t1_cdzyjef,t1_cdzxxwo,null,1428257299,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;If so, that's true, but electrical heating can heat a space more efficiently than the excess heat from bulbs does. 

Unless there are very strong air currents it doesn't really matter where the heater is

&gt;You also reduce waste quite a bit - no more bulbs to throw away every few years. 

Why are you so sure that this is better? Incandescent light bulb is glass with a bit of metal. It's pretty much the least polluting non-biodegradable trash there is.  
A led requires a rectifier, condensator and a voltage stabilisator, a more complex general construction, a bit of phosphor, metal and probably also glass.

&gt;There really isn't a comparison to be made between incandescent bulbs and LEDs though.  

Currently LEDs aren't that economical. The LED equivalent of 100W incandescent costs about $80. There is a serious problem with scaling power, leds have great efficiency only in lower power and when monochromatic. Efficiency isn't great - 20W LED is equivalent to 100W incandescent (92W halogen I think), which is equivalent to about 23W CFL. Philips LEDbulb is rated for 25k hours, 10x the life of a halogen bulb.  

It's going to take about two years for them to pay for itself... I think I'll wait for a drop in price.

On top of that if some team gets close Bayern will simply buy one of the other teams key player. Not just because they really need him but at least to 50% of taking him away from the opposition. See Mario Goetze. Hey was key part of the Dortmund success, now he is simply another pawn.

The way electricity grids are *currently* designed. But yeah, we'll see what the NIMBYs will have to say when a new transmission line passes nearby or when an pump storage plant is being built on the local hill. A lot remains to be done, be it reengineering the grid, developing interim storage systems or reducing energy consumption. And it will be expensive (but it probably can be exported). I don't think everybody understands the other side of the coin yet.

The long-term effects this will have on emissions remains to be seen. The new coal fired plants that are being built had been planned for a long time, and they emit much less than the old ones they replace. Several plants have already been shut down years ahead of schedule, because they just weren't profitable anymore. Where this has a negative effect is with gas turbines, which emit less than coal fired plants, but become more expensive to operate because they're the ones that get used to compensate for the variable production of renewables because they're much quicker to adjust their output. This means that most of the time they don't operate near capacity, so cost goes up. This is bad.

Anyway, when you calculate emissions, to have to take the effects of lower cost for wind and solar into account, and those are global. Those would still be much more expensive if it hadn't been for the German energy policy, especially photovoltaics.

* CUP: libertarian socialist.

Opposition:

* PSC(Catalonian party associated with the PSOE): social-democrats pro-Spain(sort of federalist) have rejected the referendum. Their relationship with the PSOE is similar to the relationship CDU-CSU.
* PP: right wing Spanish ruling party.
* Ciutadans – Partit de la Ciutadania: center *left* constitutionalist. Non-affiliated with any Spain-wide party.

I agree with you, in the end, if you are keen to work together, cultural differences don't amount to much and can always be overcome. But I would say this about ALL cultural differences across the globe, and not just European cultural differences. I am able to do business in Japan or Brazil, just as I can in Amsterdam or Barcelona, shared humanity can always triumph over cultural differences and I don't really distinguish between a European or a non-European when it comes to business. 

We all have different and complex identities and perhaps for Germans the European identity is a very strong one for historic reasons. For someone like me who is English, I would say that my identies are certainly English and then after that British, but after that I don't necessarily feel culturally closer to someone from Europe than someone from the rest of the World - particularly if that person speaks English, has the same legal system as me and plays cricket and laughs at the same jokes as me. Just as Germans are able to understand British culture easily because they have access to the language, so too are many other people round the world. However far away Australians and New Zealanders might be from us, our shared cultural heritage and language means that we will never think of Australians and New Zealanders as being further culturally removed from us as we think Greeks and Italians are. For Britain our concern with Europe has never been that it is too big, always instead that it is too small.  Britain needs strong alliances and trading partners across the globe and I think we can achieve that best by leaving the EU.

On the common fisheries policy, I don't know the details about that unfortunately. Britain has not liked the common agricutural policy for years and nothing seems to get changed despite us being in the EU. (Margaret Thatcher did manage to get the famous British rebate though. She knew how to play hardball, old school...) As to Schengen, I don't have strong feelings about that.

It's even more grave now that the Spanish government dictates the limits of debt that have to pay the autonomous administrations and they are strangling the finances just for the fucking sake of it, allowing more spending in the central government. 

4/5 of the spending in the current budget of the Generalitat are dedicated to the said competences (health, education, police, basic services) and yet we're having to cut immensely on basic welfare just to pay our *part of the debt*. Meanwhile 2 months of last year's military budget could have paid for al the social cuts in Catalonia.

And yes, what the people **who lived 35 years ago** voted, on an **unstable** situation with **noise of bullets being fired in the background** and without **alternative** other than another **dictatorship**... simply can't keep the Catalan people from **expressing** their will.

They're **so fucking afraid** of having actual and factual numbers in the table they won't allow the Catalan to vote **no matter what**, even thought if independence won all that'd happen is that negotiations would start with the facts known. This is not about declaring unilateral independence after the poll!.

And, by all means, that's not an acceptable way to deal with it. If they don't want an independent Catalonia, they should try and keep minimum democratic hygiene and decency, such as the UK, where they will allow the vote and will simply try to convince the electorate that No is the best answer.

The way Spain is handling it won't exactly satisfy anybody. It will just elevate the conflict and further polarize towards independence those Catalan who want more autonomy but not necessarily independence.

&gt; Does the church have an opinion on this?

Personally I don't think the church's opinion should matter at all, but it has an opinion indeed.

The Spanish catholic church is very conservative (and when I say very I mean it). they are totally against the independence. They are absolutely against any form of peripherical nationalism (catalan, basque, etc) but they are the most fierce spanish nationalists. You could see them as the spanish version of the tea party, with the diference that they have existed since forever. Their ideology hasn't actually changed since the Spanish Inquisition was a thing.

But inside catalonia and specially in rural areas (everywhere outside Barcelona actually) most of the catholic authorities (bishops, cardinals, etc) support the independecne, or, at least, the catalan nationalism.

I should mention, to put you in prespective of things, that the Spanish Catholic Church was the main organization that suported the military rebelion that lead to the civil war on 1936 and the following 40 years of dictatorship.

The reason why it makes sense for Britain to be in the EU and shape its way is because our destinies are intertwined.

Whether we are in a Union or not just makes the difference between going together in one direction, or everyone going at it alone, even if that means bad things will happen (see prisoner's dilemma).

I tend to agree, but this doesn't change anything about this being necessary for collectivised debt and automatic transfers. Both to avoid the blank cheque issue, and because it's *the* bargaining chip that the rich economies have to give in return for the necessary transfer of sovereignty for a more federalised union.

Federalisation is politically difficult everywhere, collectivised debt and automatic transfers are extremely unpopular in the core but very popular in the periphery. Federalisation in return for collectivised debt and automatic transfers *might* be possible, because both exist implicitly anyway, as could/can be seen during the current crisis. Formalising one without the other would mean a new status quo that would politically be close to impossible to change.

However, what appears to be happening instead of a grand exchange is to phase this in gradually (e.g., banking union vs. stability and growth pact). If the European Parliament manages to select the next President of the Commission, this would be another important step towards giving the more federal economic union a democratically more legitimate footing.

I also recommend to not buy it online! Buy it local. A Lederhose can be tricky if you want to go on the Oktoberfest and do a long day (10-12h) of Drinking, flirting, schunkeln, eating""!

And its so depressing to watch those poor guys with their fading hand skills trying to close their zipper ""Latz"".

If the Lederhosen should be too dirty (A Real Lederhosen never can be to dirty!) try clean it with an wet towel or better brush it with a special leather brush you also would use for leather shoes.

Okay, the UAE has rich citizens. You can keep denying that but it's till true.

&gt;How does a building aggravate you? that is ridiculous. Are you okay with gypsy ghettos or only white ghettos for you?

It takes from my space. You know one of the good things about Italy was that there were no ghettos. There were no homeless people. At least I hadn't seen any. These aren't problems of the Italians. These are problems the immigrants bring. Now, they have taken districts of Milan and they are slowly turning them into shit holes just like they did with their former countries.

&gt;Well you live in a white bubble, most Europeans are actually fine with moderate immigration, as seen by election results even in countries where there is a social problem radical parties rarely break 30%. And that is a percentage of voters. And not everyone votes.

I'm okay with moderate immigration too. You want to come here and study? Fine. You're a doctor? An engineer? An architect? You're welcome. Sadly though the vast majority of immigrants aren't like that. They just exploit the country. As for the voters, I wouldn't vote far right either because immigration isn't the only thing that politics are concerned with. There is economic plans and all that stuff which I dislike in the right.

&gt;I'm not mad, just making a joke, that you didn't get NOBODY IS FORCING YOU TO DO ANYTHING ! ! ! you are free to do whatever you want, move to another country or spot looking at mosques.

No, mosques are ugly and I do not want them anywhere near me. I don't have to close my eyes. Do you want someone redecorating your house? Didn't think so.

The main problem is that even if they are in the right, and germany is taking advantage of the situation, they can't complain cause they are guilty.

For instance, with euro everything become twice as expensive. With a strong euro everything should become cheaper. So why? Because shopkeepers were scamming people...but yea blame the euro.

Their bargaining power with the bondholders also gets a lot better too. Having a suplus means that they could (a) leave the euro more easily and (b) default on their debt more easily. They won't want to do either of these things, but they will be in the minds of all negotiating parties.

Oh, I agree with that, only there's two problems. First, it depends on whether your creditors are going to recognise the primary surplus. If they feel that it's only logistical and flimsy, they won't feel pressured to change their stance. 

Second, it depends on how much Greece will press the point. If Greek politicians have decided a priori that they won't be leaving the monetary union and defaulting no matter what, then the primary surplus is meaningless. Only if the threat has some basis on reality does it become a source of pressure for the creditors. 

&gt; Also , Greece has just entered deflation territory and it is not clear when they will come out of it. Without a suplus, their debt would continue to grow, even if there was no deficit.

Social Systems (1983), Emmanuel Todd. Però a mio parere un pò troppo negativo sul fatto che la famiglia si richiude su se stessa. RIporto le loro conclusioni :

""We show that differences in family values have an impact on attitudes and outcomes that are 
relevant to explain differences in growth across countries and the quality of institutions. We study 
attitudes toward working women, the society, generalized morality and civic engagement. Our 
findings confirm an idea first developed by political scientists and sociologists: trust in the family 
prevent the formation of generalized trust, which is at the core of many collective good outcomes, 
from political participation to the formation of institutions to economic development. This should 
not be taken of course as a “criticism” of the family as a fundamental institution of society but as an 
analysis of the effect of different family arrangements. Our analysis indeed shows that family ties are 
related to different measures of happiness, life satisfaction and self-reported health. ""

They collect and manage like 90% of the total taxes and then every year pay a sum (that they negotiate) to the Spanish government for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Crown administration, basically. So their deal is miles better, plus they don't get as much hate and attention by the state or the population (even with ETA active).

We theoretically had a good deal but they fucked us over with the doctrine of the *coffee-for-all*, basically you didn't had to be a historical nation or a strong revindication of self-government to access the autonomous status, and so by state law the exception became the norm. As have all our claims for more self-government been copied by other regions (point by point in their organic laws) and the whole administration has become a mess of spending higher and higher. Plus Madrid never renounced (for whatever reason) to any of the Ministries that had all the competences delegated to autonomies... I don't know what they have been doing or spending there during 20 years or so, certainly trying to bend us so they have power and resources that they shouldn't. 

To compare Catalonia only collects and manages directly -without the action of the state- the 8% of total taxes. The Spanish government will give us what they think it's fair and then so it is. That is without saying that we have a negative balance return of aprox. 8-10% of our GPD, during 3 decades... It's astounding. 

Little Off Topic with  one thingThe flag burning was more common when the political movement was more clandestine and radical, nowadays you can only see it occasionally in the 11S by the Radical left-wing groups. Those are the ones that were active during the dictatorship and transition and so their manners are a bit hardcore. 

Still I must express that they burned the flags of the states of Spain and France with symbolic meaning, that they wish the abolishment of those states. There is a civil flag for Spain (without the crest) but people don't know it or the don't care and the media seem to be obsessed that one act during a year is trying to disrespect the sentiment of Spaniards. It's not the case.

The Spanish (specially hierarchy) one declares that national unity and fraternity is sacred, not even kidding. The Catalan defend the right to decide for Catalan people, even if discretely amongst bishops and archbishops, my guess is that they're tired of the amount of bullshit that can pull the Spanish Episcopal Conference.

The rich neighborhoods want to change this situation with a new organization that they think will benefit the whole city, but the management neighborhood (that doesn't want to lose its business) opposes together with the poor neighborhood (that believe the proposal unfair). Nothing is changed. The rich neihborhoods are getting poorer, and so are the poor communities. Everything is right, but everything goes wrong.

true,yoshiK,GERM,Germany,"&gt; Socialism, as socialists describe it, require redistribution of wealth, the core tenet of libertarianism is opposition to redistribution of wealth.

The core tenet of socialism is the abolishment of classes and states, which may or may not have anything to do with the redistribution of wealth. To quote [Lenin](http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch04.htm#s2) on the topic:

&gt; It was solely against this kind of “abolition” of the state that Marx fought in refuting the anarchists! He did not at all oppose the view that the state would disappear when classes disappeared, or that it would be abolished when classes were abolished. What he did oppose was the proposition that the workers should renounce the use of arms, organized violence, that is, the state, which is to serve to ""crush the resistance of the bourgeoisie"". 

Incidentally,  Lenin is the most prominent non-libertarian socialist, and here he precisely discusses the relationship between libertarian socialists ( anarchists) and vanguardists. 

&gt;  and left wingers who think they can legitimately use the term ""libertarian"" are just appropriating and attempting to redefine the term.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism) informs me, that 

&gt; The use of the word ""libertarian"" to describe a new set of political positions has been tracked to the French cognate, libertaire, which was coined in 1857 by French anarchist Joseph Déjacque who used the term to distinguish his libertarian communist approach from the mutualism advocated by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. [...] Libertarian has been used by some as a synonym for anarchism since the 1890s. [...]

And if you look through the article, you will find that the status of private property as a right is historically the most important distinguishing factor between the different libertarian movements. While they all agree on other civil rights, like free speech or limitations of state power.

true,redundantbits,CATA,Catalonia,"I am from Catalonia and all my life I used to stand for separation. I had always supported any kind of act for independence, even if I did not 100% agree with it, thinking al least it was a step towards the idependence and towards creating the debate needed to make the separation happen. Well, since a couple of years ago, I'm no longer pro-separation.

**In the last years, the movement for separation has become stronger,** specially after the 2011-09-11 pro-separation demonstration (where I participated). **But stronger doesn't mean more solid.** If the movement has won more people, it's mostly no-brain stupid people that carry a flag just because it's mainstream, just as if it was a Barça-Madrid competition. The main political party in Catalonia (CiU), which is right-wing and has never stood for a clear yes or no, has suddenly become pro-separation since that september. It was like ""OK, we have been ambiguous for as long as we could, now we can't avoid to be clear. BUT, separation will only happen if WE (CiU) are the leaders of this movement"". And ever since that, it's been an increasing nationalism everyday. Politics, economics and the media in Catalunya go quite together since the powefull ones in the three aspects are mostly the same. Yes, that means a lot of corruption, but in respect with this issue it has become almost a fascism. All the news in the public television are clearly pro-separation, the newspaper partially owned by people from CiU is given for free in the trains, universities, etc. And so on. But it's not like ok, we clearly stand for this side, it's about lies and manipulation of history and news, about not giving equal voice to all political parties, etc. **Neo-fascism** I would say. They try to spread (most of the times unfounded) hate towards the rest of Spain, talking shit about them as if they were *the enemy*, as if *all* the responsability of the crisis in Catalonia came from *them*. It comes that only a few things can be blamed on the rest of Spain, and most of the shit comes from inside Catalonia. This obviously pisses Spanish people off, and in return they hate us more. It's a vicious circle. But what surprises me is that Spain has (at leat now) a lot of arguments to say ""Hey Catalonia, you're just doing it wrong. Let's sit and put things clear"" but they haven't done it (institutionaly). My conclusion is that for a long time both Catalan and Spanish political parties have taken short-term profit (votes) from talking shit about the others, making hate grow little by little in both sides. And even now that the situation has become serious, they keep doing that. I strongly think that both sides know that all this is  going to end being nothing. The situation is really sad, because meanwhile both Mas and Rajoy take strong political decisions that cut people's rights and social status, also doing their corrupt stuff and so. It's (almost) all a big big manipulation and the only thing that gives me a little hope is that I think people are starting to be aware of that.

Now they put this double-question referendum:


**1. Do you want Catalonia to become a state?**

**2. Do you want it to be an independent state?**


What the hell? How is that supposed to be a **one** simple, direct and understandable question? What does even *independent* state mean? No state is independent, not even North Korea. What if we become a *state* but not an *independent state*? Also, how the hell are the results going to be interpreted? What I think is that all of them, everybody, knows that all this is just not going to happen. They've been this ambiguous to gain the needed support of some parties to make the referendum. They say a picture says more than a thousand words. Well, [this](https://scontent-b-mad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/p480x480/1003572_10152989916652588_209016325_n.jpg) one reflects how convinced they look about the referendum.

I think democracy is not people having power, but people having the power to choose who is in their Government.

I've liked the idea of adding the third question:

**3. Justify your answer.**


**TL;DR:** Both Spanish and Catalan people are under a big manipulation (actually, under a fight between two big manipulations). Nationalisms, when they gain power, they can quickly become neo-fascisms. This can make people like me no longer stand for a separation.

*La division nait aussi, comme je l’ai rappelé, du communautarisme, conséquence naturelle de l’égoïsme triomphant et d’une forme de tribalisation archaïque.*

*La division nait de la faiblesse de nos dirigeants incapables de faire respecter des règles communes livrant ainsi la loi aux appétits des lobbyistes les mieux organisés ou les plus financés.*

*Il nous faut retrouver la voie de l’unité nationale ! Cette voie passe nécessairement par un projet collectif, un projet national, qui pousse les Français à s’engager dans les vrais combats, à miser sur leurs forces, celles qui fédèrent la Nation !*

Expanding, it would also completely undermine the referendum.

Finché la legge stava al Senato Alfano, dato che là i numeri glielo consentivano, poteva bloccare tutto finché non arrivava una riforma che gli andasse bene (e cioè che aiutasse i piccoli partiti, quindi proporzionale con sbarramento basso). Con la sentenza della Corte costituzionale - e quindi col ritrovato interesse dell'opinione pubblica in materia, perché la vergogna delle liste bloccate e bla bla bla - non si poteva restare in Senato a fare figure di merda rinviando tutto ogni settimana, e si è dovuto dare il famoso segnale spostando tutto alla Camera dove, dato che il Pd se vuole fa maggioranza da solo (che questo avvenga in virtù del famoso premio di maggioranza illegittimo è un dettaglio secondario) è chiaro che si va più spediti.

A questo punto entra in gioco Renzi. Che sulla legge elettorale gioca due partite: una di immagine (ha interesse a passare per quello che dopo sette anni è riuscito a cancellare la vergogna delle liste bloccate e bla bla bla) e una, che è quella davvero importante, di sostanza. L'interesse di Renzi - cioè del capo di uno dei partiti elettoralmente più grossi in circolazione - è quello di massimizzare l'utilità dei partiti grossi a danno di quelli piccoli. Da qui l'intenzione, che oggi si va facendo abbastanza palese, di trattare direttamente con gli altri partiti grossi (cioè Berlusconi e Grillo) che condividono lo stesso utile e di mettersi d'accordo con loro. Questo non vuol dire che ci sia in automatico l'accordo per il maggioritario a doppio turno che vuole il Pd (per Grillo sarebbe un'inculata paurosa e anche Berlusconi ci perderebbe), ma un surrogato di maggiorzionale con sbarramento alto e premio di maggioranza con soglia può venire fuori.

Questo fa capire perché Alfano si sia innervosito e abbia mandato avanti Quagliariello a dire che o l'accordo viene fatto pure con loro oppure dopo la Befana fanno la crisi di governo. In questa prospettiva per Alfano o c'è l'estinzione o c'è il ritorno con cappello in mano da Berlusconi per farsi mettere in coalizione.

I am a native German myself so I don't share this phenomenon. But I did meet several people here who picked up not high German, but a strong dose of the local accent simply because they use that much more often. So you are not alone at all.  
Myself, I notice that when I am abroad in an English speaking country, I start using the local accent even though I do not intend to do so. It just happens.

I totally disagree I think they are beautiful strictly from an esthetic point of view, some of Sicily's best architecture is composed out of mosques.

you don't get to make it you are just an a resource used by somebody's ego, you have no idea what his real intentions are, and he doesn't give a shit about what your ideals are, just as long as you go and give 110% to defend his interests.

Do you think you care about ideals, in those last moments , you're sweating, your hyperventilating, other people are screaming and crying around you, you feel your chest heavier and heavier, you struggle for breath, you head is spinning and you just feel tired and dizzy, do you think you even care about being a hero in those last moments before you die? Or lets say you survive but are handicapped emotionally and physically. You'll be a hero for a couple of weeks maybe even months, but after that ,the members of your family will be the heroes for taking care of you and loving a broken mind....In the meantime the general that sent you gets a boost in rank, gets awarded a medal and is declared a public hero, the politician that started the war is a hero and a visionary if he won, or gets labeled the bad guy if he loses...  but you clearly don't get it, so long live romantic ideals...

Poverty increases crime rates not immigration, Immigration minus integration leads to poverty, do some non-racist research.

Now common ground...

&gt;You want to come here and study? Fine. You're a doctor? An engineer? An architect? You're welcome. Sadly though the vast majority of immigrants aren't like that. They just exploit the country.

I agree the selection and integration of immigrants is abysmal this should be the issue, not the number, but the support they receive to become active citizens.

&gt;how much of out taxes go to welfare to immigrants

actually curious, I doubt welfare generates a relevant deficit in your budget, but I agree that welfare is not the right type of stimulus if your purpose is to integrate them.

&gt;I don't want these problems.

I don't want you to have them either, but immigration will happen, the Albanians that invaded the SE ten years ago where all Ilegal, most present day Lybians are Illegal, It is inevitable, you need zero tolerance for illegal and communication and actual effort to integrate legal immigrants. Closing the doors or an limiting communication only gives illegals a reason not to call the authorities when they witness their conational doing something illegal.

A separate issue with it is how it completely reverses campaign strategies. The majority of Spaniards are not Catalan. 40m non Catalans vs. 7.5m Catalans approximately. The dominant strategy for the Catalan government is therefore to get non-Catalans to vote to kick Catalonia out of Spain, rather than getting Catalans to vote to leave Spain (obviously they only have one campaign strategy, so its either 'Catalonia is good' or 'Catalonia is bad'). As I said, 100% Catalonia can vote 'Yes' but still lose overwhelmingly; hence in a nationwide referendum on Catalan independence, Catalonia would only be a minority group.

Not really. I'd say with was more from the fact that Spain was fighting France (both the Catalan Revolt and the Portuguese Restoration War were partially incited by Richelieu) and the fact that Portugal was stronger at the time than Catalonia (Portugal had a standing army, a navy, several colonies from which tax and troops could be withdrawn to feed the war, while Catalonia had a militia and french military support). It was no cakewalk though, Portugal was warring with Spain and indirectly with the Dutch. It had to fight off both the Dutch overseas and Spain in the Iberian peninsula.

When France eventually bailed out on Portugal and Catalonia, it betrayed both and signed a treaty that chopped Catalonia in two and stated that Phillip III (or IV) was King of Portugal.

There is something of that, but our electricity prices are essentially screwed for some decades to come due to some braindead strategic decisions made by the government; they decided to ""go green"" with renewables (wind turbines), which is in principle a wise direction, since we have no oil, coal or any other classical energy source (nor money to build nuclear, even if we wanted to). right?

However,  the devil is in the details, as they say. Wind turbines aren't economically viable today, so they have to be subsidised. Worse, the government agreed to *guarantee* an insane amount profit to EDP (and all others that came later, of course). Now, if these contracts were made in good faith, after 12-15 of use, the turbines are amortized and begin to compete with the other sources, right? After all, wind is free... Wrong! State subsidies are _increasing_, not diminishing.

Current (well...I think) european market price is 59€/MWh. We pay 130€/MWh. And will pay even more in the future, it's already stated in the contracts. They call it ""tariff deficit"" or something :-(

true,nessi,,Saarland expat,"Saarland. Close affinity to France (and Luxembourg) which it borders, but not as much as the rest of Germany seems to think. Saarland only joined (West)-Germany in 1956 as a result of WW2 after which it was under French control. Because of its mining resources it changed back and forth between France and Germany quite a bit, depending which side won the war du jour. 

The southern part is quite industrial, but the rest of the state is very rural and heavily forested (contrary to common knowledge). Lots of Roman remains. And it also features one of [/r/earthporn's favorite river loops](https://www.google.com/search?q=saarschleife&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=FRE&amp;sa=X&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=0huqUse3KIT4yQHBzYC4DQ&amp;ved=0CC0QsAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=672). 

Communities are very tight knit with a unique and diverse dialect that consists of quite a few French loan words though pronunciation changed significantly. Saarländer love a good party. They come up with every excuse to have one. It starts with New Years, which leads into Carnival season (often with multiple weekends of events), Kirmes, Stadtfest, Weihnachtsmarkt, many of them with their local traditions. The list goes on and on. As I said, they love to celebrate. LOTS of excellent food (influenced by Lorraine). Their motto is ""Hauptsach gudd gess"" - the most important thing is that we eat well. Saarland loves its Karlsberg beer, but also grows some excellent wine. 

People in Saarland used to sometimes display a little bit of an inferiority complex, but that's abating quickly, with a newly discovered interest and pride in their own heritage. They fiercely love their state and ANY debate on whether it's too small and should be made part of the neighboring Rheinland-Pfalz is viewed with extreme suspicion and rejection, and jokes about people who live 5 minutes away in the other state are made frequently. 

Saarländer are notorious for not wanting to leave Saarland. Saarland expats are notorious for missing it.

Such is life. Seeing as her ancestors have failed for thousands of years chances are she will too.

&gt;Where did you grow up? (joke alert)the airport?

You joke is not funny. It is true that I'm from a smaller settlement but what I said still stands.

&gt;what if Italian catholic build a big green cube as a church would it bother you or your race has the right to redecorate your house because it's theirs to.

That's not even a real sentence. But from what i understand-no it's not the Muslims' house too.

&gt;Do you think you care about ideals, in those last moments , you're sweating, your hyperventilating, other people are screaming and crying around you, you feel your chest heavier and heavier, you struggle for breath, you head is spinning and you just feel tired and dizzy, do you think you even care about being a hero in those last moments before you die? Or lets say you survive but are handicapped emotionally and physically. You'll be a hero for a couple of weeks maybe even months, but after that ,the members of your family will be the heroes for taking care of you and loving a broken mind....In the meantime the general that sent you gets a boost in rank, gets awarded a medal and is declared a public hero, the politician that started the war is a hero and a visionary if he won, or gets labeled the bad guy if he loses... but you clearly don't get it, so long live romantic ideals... Fortza italia, go azzuri and the peninsula rules.

You said it-we don't matter. We don't-our lives are a brief as the clap of a butterfly's wings. What do the last moments of my life matter? Sure I may regret it in those hours, but all in all it's a good thing that I left a legacy. Plus I don't think it's nice to fight for a politician's ideals. I mean real causes which you believe in. Those are what you should fight for.

Anyhow, if we are to accept all of these people what makes you think they will be different than the gypsies? They won't. Why would anyone want such a problem? And again, why do I need poor immigrants who will only do bad things? I don't get it. 

Welfare isn't a huge deficit but it's still money who can go to increase the pensions of actual Italians who have worked hard for the country all their lives instead of going to some lazy slobs that came here to exploit us.

Berlusconi happened, many times, then he went kaput under many scandals and with our government at his weakest and a huge public debt we became an easy prey for the financial market and we had to switch to an emergency austerity government in order to avoid financial default, then Berlusconi was not kaput anymore so he dumped the austerity government and in april we had new elections.

* In the election 3 different parties (center-left, center-right, everyonesucksbutme) received around the 30% of the votes each, and everyone of them is openly in war with the other two.     
  
- The center-left had the majority of votes and tried to persuade the populist party to enter in a coalition with them, on the basis that their programs had a quite large common ground to work with. The answer was ""fuck you, you make the government with Berlusconi so we can throw shit at you and win the next round""  
  
- The center-left leader stepped-down and let the christian-democratic component of his party form a government with the christian-democratic component of Berlusconi's party.  
  
* When the court  definitely upheld his 4 years sentence for corruption, Berlusconi tried to sink the government in order to save his ass and seat, but his men in the government refused to play his game so the party split in two, right-wing-populists and christian-democrats. Berlusconi has also been expelled by the senate.  
    
-  The center-left party is going through some big changes too: the mayor of Florence has just won the primary elections, bringing a big political discontinuity from the past apparatus and the members of the government, and is supposed to win the next elections.

true,grimborg,null,null,"No se trata de odio, en absoluto. Se trata de que los catalanes puedan decidir en qué se invierten sus impuestos y cómo debe funcionar su país sin el control de otro país. No es nada nuevo. Muchos países lo han hecho ya en tiempos muy recientes. Se trata de ser buenos vecinos, e independientes; de vivir y dejar vivir.

Democracia real es escuchar a una gran mayoría y tomar acciones políticas para conseguirlo. Los catalanes llevan siglos pidiendo tener su propio país fuera de España. En los últimos años, viendo el despropósito político contínuo de España, todavía más. Este año, más de un millón y medio de personas formaron una cadena humana de 400km pidiendo que se les pregunte si quieren que Cataluña sea un Estado independiente. En democracia se puede votar. Eso es lo que piden. No deberían hacer falta manifestaciones.

Una Cataluña dentro de España habría podido funcionar, pero la obsesión centralista, el afán homogenizador y el orgullo castizo del gobierno de España siempre lo han evitado. En Cataluña hay que estar peleando continuamente tan sólo para conseguir que España no ahogue la lengua y la cultura propias de Cataluña, para conseguir que España pague lo que promete para poder construir las infraestructuras necesarias, para que España no imponga reformas educativas que sólo empeoran los resultados y que se imponen para perjudicar la cultura catalana. Mientras España dilapida dinero en aeropuertos fantasma, autopistas sin coches y trenes sin viajeros en Cataluña faltan infraestructuras para poder seguir creciendo.

Cataluña ha contribuído (no sola, naturalmente) muchísimo dinero España para ayudar a las regiones que tienen menos capacidad de producir capital. En vez de usar esta ayuda para mejorar esas regiones, hacer que se valgan por si mismas y conseguir que poco a poco haga falta menos ayuda, el dinero se ha malgastado.

Cataluña será independiente o no será. Quedan muy pocas naciones con lengua y cultura propias dentro de otros estados. Su cultura y su lengua será machacada por España. Su capacidad de crecer seguirá limitada por el lastre de tener que ayudar a mantener a un país que hace muy poco para salir a flote, y más limitada aún por la falta de consideración a la hora de asignarle recursos. Será gobernada desde fuera, con políticas españolas cortas de miras---vean Galicia, Valencia o las Baleares.

Una España sin Cataluña tendrá que aprender a manejar los recursos con inteligencia, porque será la forma de salir a flote. Tendrá que ayudar a los otros motores de España a crecer. Si lo hace, el resultado será una España más fuerte.

Los españoles de todas partes de España han demostrado que tienen la capacidad de organizarse, de manifestarse, de exigir lo que se les debe y de cambiar las cosas. Los políticos en el poder, por desgracia, no. Cuando el Prestige, fueron las personas las que dejaron todo y fueron a limpiar las playas. Con los indignados y con el esfuerzo que se ha hecho para ayudar a parar desahucios se ha demostrado lo mucho que los ciudadanos pueden conseguir.

true,Pickleburp,UNSA,USA,"Germanic Paganism is Heathenry. There's /r/Heathenry (which I'm an op for and we're working to get more active) and /r/asatru, the primary difference being that Asatru is the Icelandic version of the Heathen traditions that originated with German peoples.

Hitler and the third reich did attempt to revive some form of heathenism prior to WWII in Germany, but it was misguided and lacked context. Not to mention that he was also using various occult sources from Christianity as well. The main interest in the ""old ways"" was largely sparked by Grimm in the 1800's, who went around Germany collecting the old folk tales. These sparked the imagination of later artists, such as Wagner, who wrote many pieces based on Heathen gods. He got much of it wrong, but it did serve to bring the old religion back to the minds of the public.

Before that, however, there really weren't a lot of pagans in Germany, but there may have been some Heathen pockets that held on. There is ample evidence that this was the case in Iceland, where stave churches built for Christ were also carved with the faces of Odin, Thor, Tyr, etc., typically in the rafters were Rome wouldn't look. As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, Charlemagne forced conversion to Christianity via violence on as many Saxons, Jutes, and other German tribes as possible. Those who fled to Denmark for protection moved on to what is now England, where it became what we now refer to as Anglo-Saxon (although it included many others from Germanic tribes). 

Charlemagne was a real asshole - he would force heathen pagans to get baptized - which many understand today that those people felt conversion meant they were cut off from their ancestors in the afterlife - and then killed them anyway.

Not to post too much of a novel, but many heathen traditions survived and were still practiced by Germans and Scandinavians (and Anglo-Saxon England) even if they didn't remember why. Krampus still survives as a Christmas tradition in Germany/Austria, and there is evidence that suggests Santa Claus himself might have originated with Odin and the Wild Hunt at Jul/Yule.

Actually, ""jidov"" (zhidov) is more like ""Yid"". A word that originally meant simply ""Jewish"" (as it still means in some Slavic languages), but during the early 20th century it turned into a slur, with ""evreu"" (&lt; Hebrew) being now used for ""Jew"".

An interesting sidestory is the ""jidovi"" (Jews) were some mythological giants in Romanian mythology: in the mountains, where there are large stones that look like ruins, the peasants thought they were ruins of an ancient race of giants. Probably because the only ancient nation of which they heard was the Jews (from the Bible), they thought that the giants were the Jews. -- Anyway, this was before there was much presence of Jews around these parts.

&gt; *Obiezione del luogocomunista:Va bene, va bene, ho capito. Una valuta forte non aiuta a competere, d’accordo. Però attira i capitali: pensa
al franco svizzero, o al dollaro. Se l’euro diventasse come il dollaro, non avremmo difficoltà ad
approvvigionarci di materie prime: ci basterebbe stampare euro per comprarle, senza contare che tutti
vorrebbero prestarci soldi, come fanno con gli Stati Uniti, perché i titoli denominati in euro diventerebbero un
investimento “rifugio”, come lo sono stati per tanto tempo i buoni del tesoro Usa. Ecco cosa fa paura agli Usa,
ed ecco perché ci hanno scatenato contro i mercati: per distruggere un pericoloso concorrente.* Risposta: Questo è forse
l’apice del “grande sogno europeo”: l’idea di infrangere, con l’euro, il monopolio del dollaro come mezzo dipagamento negli scambi internazionali (il petrolio si paga in dollari) e come valuta rifugio (i titoli statunitensi sono
tuttora visti come un investimento piuttosto appetibile da chiunque, in giro per il mondo, abbia liquidità in eccesso).
Corollario: se le cose oggi non funzionano, la colpa è di un complotto della finanza yankee, che cerca di disfarsi di
un pericoloso concorrente. Ma questo è ridicolo, perché l’euro non è mai stato considerato un’alternativa credibile
al dollaro.
Una prova? Basta osservare la percentuale di euro detenuti dai portafogli delle banche centrali come valuta di
riserva (figura 5). Nel 1995 le valute forti antenate dell’euro (marco tedesco, franco francese, fiorino olandese,
Ecu) contavano per circa il 20 per cento delle riserve valutarie mondiali. Il loro erede, l’euro, debuttò nel 1999
con un ben più contenuto 14 per cento, al quale è ritornato, nonostante un temporaneo rialzo dovuto
all’apprezzamento subìto dal 2001. Insomma: altro che spiazzamento del dollaro! Non sembra che le banche

true,BavarianStallion,null,null,"Bavarian here. So let's answer your question one by one

**""what sets your region's culture apart from the others?""**

First of all, you have to know that Bavaria itself basically is split into three different cultures. We have the Franconians, the Swabians and the superior (I am not biased, just stating a fact) Altbayern (Old Bavarians).

Most of Franconia and Swabia was annexed by Bavaria about 200 years ago and they still won't assimilate. I would even go so far as to say that we are closer to our Austrian neighbors. 

So when you think about Bavaria you talk about Altbayern which consists of Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate.

We are the guys foreigners have in mind when they picture Germans. We wear Lederhosen and Dirndl and drink beer from huge ""steins"".
 

What sets us apart from other German regions is our superiority in:


- cars (BMW, Audi)

- beer (Augustiner)

- dialect
 
- food (Leberkas, Schweiners, Weißwürscht, Presssack, etc.)

- education (you couldn't get a job as a janitor in Bavaria with an Abitur (A-levels/high school diploma) from Hamburg or Hessia)

- soccer/football (Bayern Munich)

- landscape 

- and together with our homies in Baden-Württemberg we are the richest region in Germany.

**""What is the common perception of your region by other Germans?""**

Most Germans are envious of about anything we do. They call us arrogant but it's only their inferiority complexes speaking.
We don't like them either. We call anybody who is not from southern Germany a Prussian swine. As a matter of fact, Prussia, the dominant German state of most of the 18th and 19th century, doesn't exist anymore and we still do. 

**""What events are traditionally held in your region""**

Oktoberfest, Gäubodenfest, any kind of ""fest""

Erklärung bezüglich des Datums: 

&gt; SERIAL - This is a serial number (32-bit unsigned integer) that must be incremented on the primary name server whenever a change is made. The recommended [RFC1912 2.2] value for this is a 10-digit number in the form YYYYMMDDnn (year, month, date, revision). For example, if you change the primary on June 4, 2001, you would enter 2001060401. If you change it again that day, you would enter 2001060402. Using this format (rather than 1, 2, 3, 4, ...) is very useful, as you can determine the last day the file was changed (which comes in handy when looking at cached entries in other DNS servers). It can also be used to double-check that you remembered to update the serial number when you last made a change. Problem? Make sure that there is NOT a decimal point in the serial number -- if so, it won't work as you think [RFC1912 2.2].

true,timoleon,FRNK,Franken,"&gt;Ziemlich miese Meinungsmache der Artikel. Liest sich wie PR von Autobauern, die keine Elektroautos großflächig vertreiben.

Sind wir jetzt schon bei den Verschwörungstheorien?  Das ging ja schnell…

Zu deiner Information: die Hersteller von Elektroautos nutzen die beschriebenen Möglichkeiten des aufgezwungenen Mietvertrags zur Profitmaximierung auf allen Ebenen des Vertriebs, unter Androhung der Fernabschaltung. Ein konkretes Beispiel aus der Schweiz gegen einen unabhängigen Importeur:

&gt;Global Car Trading (GCT) in Schindellegi importiert Autos direkt in die Schweiz – also unter Umgehung der offiziellen Importeure. Die Firma nutzt die Preisunterschiede zwischen der Schweiz und dem umliegenden Ausland, inklusive Gefälle bei der Mehrwertsteuer, und bietet selbst Kleinwagen einige Tausend Franken günstiger an als offizielle Händler. Die Wettbewerbskommission setzt sich ausdrücklich für Direktimporte ein und sieht diese als Mittel gegen die Abschottung des Schweizer Marktes. [...]

&gt;Für die Umschreibung des Batterievertrags forderte RCI Finance, die Finanzierungsfirma von Renault in der Schweiz, von GCT 600 Franken pro Fahrzeug.

&gt;Über eine Woche nach der Zahlung des Betrags hatte GCT noch keinen Mietvertrag erhalten. neuen Batterievertrag auszustellen. 

&gt;Auch RCI Finance nimmt diese Haltung ein, wie ein Mail vom gleichen Tag verrät: «Wir unterstützen nicht die Fahrzeuge, die sind durch eine andere Kanal importiert.» Dafür wies RCI Finance den GCT-Mitarbeiter Xavier Kilchmann darauf hin, dass das Auto ohne Batteriemietvertrag in der Schweiz nicht fahren könne: «Wir werden die Aufladung der Batterie blockieren.»

&gt;Gut einen Monat später klappte es dann doch: RCI Finance mailte Kilchmann einen Mietvertrag. Der Hammer kam dann Mitte September: RCI Finance wollte von GCT für die Umschreibung des Mietvertrags plötzlich nicht mehr 600, sondern 1500 Franken pro Fahrzeug.

The referendum hasn't been formally requested at the Spanish government and it's already refused, great. It cannot be illegal because it hasn't been demanded nor granted.

I don't want to modify any constitution, I don't accept that constitution that (as I've said) is newer that my local Parliament and Government.

What I know is that since last year legally the Parliament of Catalonia is where it resides the sovereignty of our People, and that overrides for anyone here whatever organic or supreme law that they wish in Madrid. We just are substituting their legality with ours.

I can speak my language just as fine without any *benevolent* law 'permitting it', in fact I would say that most of laws regarding that subject since the 17 hundreds have been to fuck us over and ban it, so no. We don't need the constitution to function legally in Catalonia, we have our organic laws.

I don't care at all if the Spanish state considers it illegal or not, we're building our own jurisprudence again. That is our will and we will carry on. No need of approval of the majority of Spaniards. Them to their affairs and us to ours. ",0,1386890315,null,0,false,0,ce0dc58,t3_1spvmz,t1_ce0dc58,t1_ce08kh6,null,1428157107,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,LunaMinerva,null,null,"La mia tecnica è quella di affiancare al discount i supermercati tradizionali, se necessario comprando 3-4 cose in uno e 3-4 in un altro. Ovviamente tenendo in considerazione solo quelli strategicamente vicini (o lungo la strada che faccio ogni giorno), altrimenti il risparmio sulla spesa finisce per essere esiguo rispetto alla benzina consumata - it goes without saying.

Innanzitutto comincia a collezionare i volantini dei vari supermercati (ipermercati meglio ancora) della tua zona e spulciali alla ricerca delle cose che ti servono/interessano, specialmente se di marca. Con un po' di allenamento comincerai a notare che ciascuna catena propone più o meno ciclicamente le stesse offerte. Per fare un esempio, ogni catena propone *sempre* un prodotto Rana in offerta: una settimana i tortellini, la settimana dopo le lasagne, quella dopo ancora i sughi. Repeat ad nauseam. Ovviamente focalizzati su offerte abbastanza sostanziose e non semplici differenze di qualche decina di centesimi rispetto al ""prezzo consigliato"", non ne vale la pena. E se la natura del prodotto lo permette, fanne la scorta. Ma attenzione ai supermercati dove esistono sia offerte per tutti sia offerte per i soli titolari di carta fedeltà: impara a distinguerle (di solito sono indicate con cartellini di colori diversi), e se ne vale la pena e non temi troppo per la tua privacy tesserati. Specialmente in quelle catene la cui raccolta punti offre l'opzione ""buono spesa da X € ogni Y punti"".

Poi, i prodotti a marchio Coop/Selex/sailcazzo: spesso e volentieri sono praticamente identici ai loro corrispettivi ""originali"", non esitare a provarli. Personalmente posso garantire per i ""Pan di Stelle"" Selex (addirittura li preferisco a quelli del Mulino Bianco, sono meno dolci) e per le mozzarelle e il tè in bottiglia Coop (sembra un mix tra l'Estathè e il Lipton, non è affatto male).

Per tutto il resto, discount: ormai in tutti c'è una buona selezione di prodotti di marca (quasi sempre a prezzi minori rispetto ai supermercati, visto che risparmiano soprattutto attraverso l'esposizione spartana dei prodotti), e anche quelli non di marca possono nascondere sorprese positive. E negative, certo: purtroppo non ci si può esimere dallo sperimentare. Personalmente preferisco altre catene rispetto al Lidl (Prix e Dico qui in Veneto), ma generalmente in tutti i reparti latticini, pasta/farina, igiene personale e frutta&amp;verdura superano abbondantemente la sufficienza. 

E sì, come diceva già qualcuno (EDIT: /u/flexgap), i mercati rionali all'ora di chiusura sono un tesoro: capita spesso che i proprietari delle bancarelle svendano certi prodotti - in modo particolare se ""fine serie"" - pur di non doverli caricare di nuovo nel furgone. Meglio ancora se ti vedono con una certa regolarità.

Alla fine è meno complicato/macchinoso di come sembra da come ne ho scritto, trust me.

Ich hab gesagt liest sich, nicht ist.

&gt; Zu deiner Information: die Hersteller von Elektroautos nutzen die beschriebenen Möglichkeiten des aufgezwungenen Mietvertrags zur Profitmaximierung auf allen Ebenen des Vertriebs, unter Androhung der Fernabschaltung.

Und wo ist das schlecht? Eine Firma muss zwangsweise so arbeiten, wie sie am besten Gewinn machen kann. Der Deal ist folgender, du bekommst ein günstiges Elektroauto, aber wir kriegen das Geschäft mit den Batterien und dagegen kannst du nichts tun.

Wie eine Netlock, nur fürs Auto.

Wenn du das nicht willst, dann kauf dir ein schickes teures Kleinserienelektroauto, wo dir dann halt auch die Batterien gehören.

Intriguing is a way of inciting. 

&gt; So tell me again after explaining me historical facts that I already know, your legitimacy comes from having kissed some English ass and being then more powerful then than Catalonia?

Exactly! Catalonia kissed Louis' ass and got curb stomped, Portugal kissed Louis' ass **and** licked Charles' balls and got to live another day. 17th century geopolitics worked this way. Regardless of any ass kissing or ball licking, in the end Portugal was still stronger than Catalonia, any day.

&gt; That is what guarantees your right to sovereignty?

Back in the day? Yep. Today? Nope.

&gt;  And the rest. if by chance, decision or faults lost we should shut up and let Spain assimilate us? Wow, what double standards that you have there sir.

Wut.

&gt; And no, without the circumstantial situation of the Hispanic Crown (and our revolt) you would likely have been crushed.

Not really. **Catalonia was crushed**. Again, if anyone is to be thanked, the french are on top of the list and following them the english.

And reading articles. Writing is a bonus (play online games on French servers).

Find something you like and you can understand with the context : SC2 or LoL esport streams are great. Find the content you like and always listen to the French version.

The brainwashing technic is also very efficient : put a background sound with French voices. Using a movie with great music in loop is a good way, music make is great to listen, you passively learn sentences and associate it with the music. Play the movie 100-200 times in French while doing something else and you will learn a lot! After some playback, rewatch the movie with subtitles, and you will finish to perfectly understand the meaning of sentences, then resume loops, and you will learn hundreds of real French expressions. Most movies have French voices so pick what you want! (My little pony, Nightmare before Christmas, Disney/Pixar movies are great for that purpose).

So my advice is to focus on understanding fluently French, do not focus on vocabulary (or worse, on learning the right gender of nouns).

Lame hipster joke. Let it be stated on record that I fully support the right of the Catalan people for self-determination, and that the sentiment is probably shared by the people who made the following comments. 

&gt; Why are the Spanish regions so focused on being independent again?

A question. 

&gt; There's an absurd amount of Catalan secessionists on this subreddit.

A reasonable conclusion, there are far more catalans in this thread with favorable views for independence than spaniards and other catalans that do not.

&gt; Stop with your rampant nationalism.

Well, some people react a little bit more aggressively to your catalan-centric history revisionism.

&gt; So utterly crushed that in fact not only the regime of Constitutions and Liberties was respected and solidified in subsequent years but the mercantile and industrious society progressed and arrive to the 700 in splendour.

Provisions that were made to appease further revolt? Being crushed doesn't mean you simply disappeared from the face of the earth.

&gt; Crushing was the loss of Roselló and the fatalities of the war, there wasn't any clear political victor with that fight.

There was a clear politic victor of that fight. France got a new province.


&gt; BTW, so happy that our rusty militia caused (partially) the hilarious loss at Montjuich, the first significant loss of the tercios in combat even if they omit it to talk about Rocroi.

Tercios weren't invincible. Doesn't change the fact that the outcome of the war was pretty favorable for France, unfavorable for Spain and catastrophic for Catalonia.

&gt; Mayhaps the fact of being en a state of constant war during decades gave the natural citizens some kind of experience that made the professional troops of the period blush.

There are other factors to consider though. If Catalonia declares independence outside the legal framework of the Spanish State then it should prepare itself for at least a decade of political and economical isolation. Secessionist movements in European states are, in the context of the numerous crises this continent has went through these past six years, more active than ever and allowing a state that has secceded forcefully into the Union would only serve to legitimise this particular course of action. Romania, Slovakia, Germany, the UK, Italy, Poland and Bulgaria would reject its inclusion into the EU outright. Other European states might do so on principle in order to protect the status quo.

Personally, I believe Catalonia remaining a part of Spain would be beneficial to both it and the continent as a whole, at least in the short term.

1) No comment. Ad hominem whenever you want. The fact of the matter is that nearly all of people that know me think that I am a moderate and cautious man when it comes to historical facts, that doesn't mean that I will agree with the official historiography of certain nation-states that are well known for their bias.

2) Being crushed means being defeated badly and you don't rise again after that situation. As we didn't rose after 1716. The positions and opinion at Court were pro severe repression. What stopped them? The incapacity of doing so and the dire situation of the state. Not compassion or strategy of appealing to truce. 

3) The fight that I was talking in that context was the struggle between the Crown and the Principality. Futhermore I was talking in perspective on the mentality of that time and the moral loss, there wasn't a sense of crushing defeat anywhere. In fact people revolted in Rosselló and there were many talks and tries to reconquer the lost lands.

4) They did seem so at the time and had very few minor losses. France searched an agreement vis-a-vis with Spain due to the reluctance of many officials and members of the government that despised the French and the people were at the verge of internal revolt, if anything they didn't have a thought strategy and unity in purpose. If they had merely tolerated the French things may very well have gone another route. So things were on the verge of going very badly for the Empire.

5) Search for *miquelets*, *vigatans* and *angelets de la terra*. You only have to find sources of the period (they're not sparse in this area) and see what they speak of. Again I refer to you not to trust my word and find out for yourself, there are even very detailed accounts of a Portuguese bourbonic general.

6) I wasn't making a point about possibility of winning the war or not, that is not the subject in hand. I was stating of the military and economic rise of the Principality to the point of competing with Castile in all fairness and dominating if it weren't for the intervention, nothing more. I was indicating that in less of 3 generations that was possible, if things were so bad as you tell us that would not have been possible.

This is just plain wrong. Your sources aren't biased but mine are? Jesus, this discussion has been you overvaluing the Catalan revolt and me desperately trying to say that the portuguese had some merit in achieving what catalans could not.

The only thing that is for sure is that it would be a Republic.

BUT, to help you get an idea, the parties that reached today an agreement to make the referendum (sorted by current spots in the catalan parliament, from more to less) are:

- **CiU** (Convergència i Unió): center-right moderate nationalist party, has won all the regional elections held in Catalunya since democracy, been in the government during all but two mandates.

- **ERC** (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya): republican left side (socialist) party, has supported the independence since the begining.

- **ICV** (Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds): left side green party. Speech in favor of echology, part of this neo-soft comunism present in all europe, specially critic against banks and capitalism.

- **CUP** (Candidatura d'Unitat Popular): radical left side party. Openly communists-anarchists, they say they want to use the system to change it completely into something more fair communist-like. Progresist and completely against capitalism. Also strong speech in favor of independence, wouldn't doubt to a unileteral declaration of independence if the referendum showed a majority of catalans in favor of independence and spanish goverment wouldn't allow it.
