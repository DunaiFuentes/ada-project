2. People will make the error changing their vote for ERC, which in itself is nothing more different than some aesthetics. Voting for CUP will never happen in big numbers because they also propose a different economic system, which makes sense but it doesn't appeal to people. They only want a different flag, while still being slaves to the same Troika.

*    In 1641, by Pau Claris.
*    In 1873, by Baldomer Lostau[1] as the ""Catalan State"".
*    In 1931, by Francesc Macià as the ""Catalan Republic within the Iberian Federation"".[2]
*    In 1934, by Lluís Companys as the ""Catalan State within the Spanish Federal Republic"".

4. Political parties don't want so, still to the contrary what you are saying people go out in droves voting for CiU and ERC with independency as the only thing in their mind.

&gt; Mas does not represent me or most of the people. He's just there holding up for power. 

Every election since the transition CiU has been the biggest formation. Spain has always had bipartidism, Catalonia had only one big party.

&gt; Convergencia: massive party

&gt; Unio: burgess party

They're both burgess, even ERC is burgess. There's no such thing as a leftwing political party, because to get representation you need money,  something the normal people lack to just spill into a political party of their own.

&gt; Iniciativa per Catalunya

What about their corruption with Agbar and other cases?

&gt; Esquerra Republicana

Jonqueras said that if they have to choose between separatism and being leftwing, they would be separatist. Finally they showed their true colours. They don't care shit about you and I. Also, once again, corruption.

&gt; Candidatures d'Unitat Popular.

Except for the fact that they are delusional in their claim for els Països Catalans (including Valencia, Balears, Southern France, Alghero), they're quite sensible. Independency can only be claimed if you also claim independency of those that control all the strings behind the scenes: banks, multinationals, energy-sector, ...

Also, you forgot one: Esquera Anticapitalista. I'll tell you why. They don't claim independency (but they *do* claim auto-determination, by popular vote).

&gt; From Spain it's being said that if Mas said we won't have independence, the movement will dissolve. But the independence movement does not come from politicians

Wrong, for two reasons: 

1. it's about education. The same way religion is pumped into kids from a young age. 
2. Every time some stupid fuck says Catalans are Polish, not worth anything, etc. there's a counter-movement. Hate breeds hate. Now, just ask yourself, why is it that when there's more corruption in the government that both the Spanish government and the Catalan government are getting out the flags? Because like a bull you only see the flag, not the sabre behind it. The bull sometimes outsmarts the matador. I'm still waiting for the people to see through the farce. Switzerland is an example that different cultures can live together in one country. It's the same idea behind Europe: *United in diversity*.

Un assistente sociale di Bologna mi assicurava che in effetti la regione fa tutto questo ma i bambini che scappano da istituti o le famiglie che mollano gli appartamenti per tornare nelle roulotte sono molti ed il problema è serio. è una questione culturale, o tornano alla vita nomade perchè non riescono ad inserirsi nella società per lo stigma che si portano addosso? E poi, ci sono campi Sinti che sono nel territorio da 40 anni e mandano i figli a scuola, e campi nomadi Rom che non parlano la lingua, si spostano e si dedicano esclusivamente all'illegalità.  
Inoltre, se magari a Bologna investono risorse in una tentata integrazione, a Roma e Milano la prassi è distruggere i campi e spostare gli zingari in prefabbricati lontani dalla città, in baracche non divise per nucleo famigliare, senza servizi di trasporto pubblico, senza raccolta rifiuti ecc.  

la questione è che il problema esiste, ha sfaccettature abbastanza complesse, e come tutti i problemi richiede investimenti economici e tempo per essere affrontato.

I was in Paris for 3 weeks the Spring before last and I just used my USAA debit card at the atm (which didn't charge me any fees, just the exchange rate, and USAA doesn't charge you to do that, they also reimburse you for most fees from other banks that do have atm fees for non customers) to withdraw a couple hundred euro every week/few days as needed.  Then I had my debit card to use if I needed it (though the only time I used it during the entire trip was to get dinner during a layover in Atlanta on our way there).  But I did run into quite a few situations where they did not accept cards of any sort.  Cash only.  So that's another reason not to mess with prepaid cards.

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"Ohne auf die fragwürdigen Aspekte Deines Beitrags im Detail einzugehen, stellt sich mir die Frage: Was sollen die Politiker denn Deiner/Eurer Meinung nach gegen diese »postdemokratischen« Tendenzen unternehmen?  Könnte es vielleicht sogar sein, dass solche Tendenzen unausweichlich sind, weil die Gesellschaft im Zuge der Vereinzelung und Individualisierung zunehmend in immer kleinere Interessenvertretungszellen, die nur selten kooperieren, oft konkurrieren, und die alle scheinbar einfache Antworten auf schwierige Fragen haben, zerfallen ist und weiter zerfällt?  Um ausreichend Wählerstimmen zu ergattern, sind Politiker heute in der misslichen Lage, es sehr vielen gleichzeitig rechtzumachen.  Und da alle Politiker nicht mehr nur eine Farbe, sondern mehrere Farben bekennen müssen, sehen sie alle etwas bräunlich aus.  Dadurch erhält man teflonbeschichtete Tarnkappenpolitiker wie Angela Merkel, weil diese in vielen den Eindruck erwecken können, dass ihre Interessen durch sie doch irgendwie vertreten werden.  Überdies hat sich ein merkwürdiges Politikverständnis eingestellt: Während man früher als Wähler lediglich die Regierung legitimierte und die Entscheidungs- und Gestaltungsgewalt an die Politik delegierte, erhebt man heute den dem Vulgärliberalismus entsprungenen Anspruch, selbst gestaltend eingreifen zu können (selbstverständlich ohne dass man vorher sich in irgendeiner Weise auch nur einfachste Grundkenntnisse draufgeschafft hätte, oder erst einmal in Kommunalpolitik Erfahrung sammelte).  Was soll nun geschehen, wenn Menschen, die alle über einen eigenen Geschmack verfügen, ihre Lieblingszutaten in den Brei, den der Koch für sie kochen soll, geben wollen?  Man erhält Ungenießbares.  Auf den Staat übertragen bedeutet das, dass dieser im Grunde handlungsunfähig zu werden droht, es im Grunde schon ist (siehe Atomausstieg durch Schwarz-Gelb).  Das sehen die Politiker, sehen aber gleichzeitig, dass die Menschen, von denen viele überaus unrealistische Forderungen vertreten, das Gefühl von Mitbestimmung haben wollen, und sie erkennen, dass diese Situation nicht auflösbar ist.  Was also nun tun?  Derzeit beschränken die Politiker sich darauf, den Menschen in maßvollen Dosen das zu versprechen, was sie hören wollen, um dann letztlich doch zu tun, was sie für richtig und notwendig halten.  Das erzürnt und verdrießt die Menschen; weil sie sich von Parteien enttäuscht sehen, gründen sie neue.  Dadurch steigt der Verhandlungsaufwand für Koalitionen, die Regierungen werden labiler.  Das eigentliche Problem aber besteht fort.

Was heute als »Postdemokratie« bezeichnet wird, ist in meinen Augen nichts weiter ist als Demokratie mit einem Wahlvolk, dessen Mitglieder kaum noch etwas eint.  Ist dies nun ein guter oder ein schlechter Zustand? Und wie müsste die Verfassung daran angepasst werden, wenn überhaupt?  Darüber ließe sich trefflich diskutieren, allerdings nur, wenn erst einmal genug Menschen diesen Zustand anerkennen.  Davon sind wir gegenwärtig weit entfernt, nicht zuletzt deshalb, weil es den meisten Menschen an politischer Mündigkeit gebricht.  Und dagegen helfen nur unmündigkeitssenkende Maßnahmen.

Oh yeah, definitely. How couldn't have Rome's decline started with Trajan, one of the most highly regarded rulers in the history of the empire. 

&gt;That is irrelevant. So were many Roman emperors. But after them a new Emperor would rule. The ""citizens"" though made sure there wouldn't be another Emperor after that one.

What citizens? 

&gt;For the sake of truth the last Roman Emperor didn't even get killed because he was a child.

What?

&gt;But Rome was ended by the very same barbarians who got citizenship in the Empire. 

Foederati did not get citizenship. They were barbarian tribes who were given the right to settle on Roman land in return for military service. The Eastern Empire employed this system as well. 

&gt;Then the Germanic barbarian Odoacer, not only ended Rome but proclaimed himself king of Italy and brought all of his barbarian brothers to Italy. 

Odoacer never proclaimed himself king of anything. He was given the title of Patrician by Zeno and the right to rule over Italy in the name of Rome. The Roman administration remained in place.

Was soll das widerlegen?  Die ""idealtypischen"" Herrschaftsformen dürfte in der Geschichte wohl stets die Ausnahme sein, sei es Demokratie oder Diktatur.

Unleugbar ist der Verlust an Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten der bundesdeutschen Demokratie durch Faktoren wie 

- die Machtverlagerung an die EU, wo die Exekutiven das Übergewicht haben. Die Interessen weiter Bevölkerungsteile der Mitgliedsländer werden dort nicht wahrgenommen, siehe Griechenland und Spanien. 

- die Folgen der Globalisierung (Konzerne verlegen Steuerquellen und Arbeitsplätze ins Ausland, Gewerkschaften verlieren ihre Bedeutung, und damit die Arbeiter eine wichtige Form der Partizipation)

- die Aufsplitterung und Trivialisieren der Medien, deren politische Berichterstattung gegenüber früher deutlich an Qualität verloren hat

Das ist eine Behauptung, die man auch schon vor 50 Jahren hätte machen können, nur waren damals Wahlbeteiligung und politisches Engagement viel höher als heute.

That's because Germany firmly protects workers' rights and has a lot of union influence. You also can't shop after 20.00 in some states for that reason. How does that tie in with religion? Sunday was just chosen for traditional reasons.

&gt;Germany is secular and you can pay the church-tax (Kirchensteuer).

That tax doesn't go to the state, it goes to the church. Having it collected that way is just an efficient way of cutting down on bureaucracy.

&gt;Germany is secular and you can study in the public university to be a teacher of Religion (Evangelic or Catholic): http://www.fastoo.com/#search/lehramt+evangelische+theologie[1]

... so? Theology is one of the oldest subjects to be taught at universities. It was part of the curriculum of the first modern university to ever exist. I don't know why a secular state should ban it. Education of any kind is good.

&gt;Germany is secular and you can teach religion in the public school: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religionslehrer[2]

You can tech it _if the children want to participate_. In addition to that, religion classes are very rarely about actual indoctrination after you enter higher education. I had a ""Leistungskurs"" [like a special focus subject] in catholic theology as an agnostic brought up protestant, and I was applauded for being critical by my teacher. It was my best subject overall, even in Abitur [which is independently reviewed], so it can't have been just him.

So don't judge based on how the few words you're read about it make things appear. Almost nobody here cares about religion at all, you just keep it to yourself.

In my opinion you should have to learn the local language and prove you can offer something, even if its just basic willingness to work and learn new skills. If you cant prove that deportation should be easy and not a red tape maze that costs the tax payer hundreds of thousands of pounds. 

The problems arise when immigrants set up ""ghettos"" where they own the property, they own the shops and so dont mix with natives. This to me causes tension from ignorance of each others culture and instead of learning and integrating you basically get problems from the natives thinking that immigrants are stealing the resources and the immigrants feel that the government isnt doing anything to help them. 

Another problem is the inbulk problem that ""refugees"" cause. Most local governments are already overstretched and simply cannot handle 300+ people turning up and needing housing and services. Governments need to find a way to stagger these movements or give more money to local charities. 

My final problem kind of goes back to my first point. It should be on the immigrant to change. We as a society are footing the bill should get to cherry pick which parts of your culture we like and intergrate into our own and which we don't. Lefty fucks should fuck off with their pc bullshit when it comes to immigrants. Not all *cultures* were created equal. Its not ok to be violently homophobic, misogynistic or anti whatever just because your religion  or barbaric culture says so. That shit may pass in the middle east but its not ok here. If you dont like it protest peacefully or fuck off.

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"&gt; &gt; Die idealtypische Form einer Demokratie, wie Crouch sie dem Artikel nach beschreibt, hat es so nie gegeben,
&gt; 
&gt; Was soll das widerlegen?  

Es soll die Behauptung widerlegen, dass Postdemokratie sich von einem postulierten Normalzustand qualitativ unterscheidet, ergo zeigen, dass es sich bei beidem um dasselbe handelt.

&gt; Unleugbar ist der Verlust an Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten der bundesdeutschen Demokratie durch Faktoren wie 
&gt; 
&gt; * die Machtverlagerung an die EU, wo die Exekutiven das Übergewicht haben. Die Interessen weiter Bevölkerungsteile der Mitgliedsländer werden dort nicht wahrgenommen, siehe Griechenland und Spanien.

Dies ist nicht wahr: die EU kann die Mitgliedsländer zur Umsetzung ihrer Pläne nicht zwingen; alle Mitgliedsländer sind nach wie vor souverän.  Dass die EU schwerwiegende Konstruktionsfehler aufweist, würde ich als letztes bestreiten, aber das ist nicht allein die Schuld der Politiker, sondern mindestens ebenso, eher stärker die der Bevölkerungen ihrer Mitgliedsländer.

&gt; * die Folgen der Globalisierung (Konzerne verlegen Steuerquellen und Arbeitsplätze ins Ausland, Gewerkschaften verlieren ihre Bedeutung, und damit die Arbeiter eine wichtige Form der Partizipation)

Was sollen die Politiker Deiner Meinung nach tun?  Schutzzölle einführen, die mit Gegenschutzzöllen beantwortet werden, wodurch »wir« unsere Exportmärkte verlieren?  Nationen mit unlauteren Steuerkonditionen militärisch unter Druck setzen?  Vorstandsvorsitzenden mit vorgehaltener Waffe die Unternehmenspolitik diktieren, oder sie gleich enteignen?

&gt; * die Aufsplitterung und Trivialisieren der Medien, deren politische Berichterstattung gegenüber früher deutlich an Qualität verloren hat

»Aufsplitterung« im Gegensatz wozu?  Gleichschaltung?  Du sprichst hier ein reales Problem an, hast es aber anscheinend noch nicht zu Ende durchdacht, sonst wüsstest Du um die Schwierigkeit seiner Lösung.

&gt; &gt; Die meisten sind einfach zu dumm, um politische Prozesse annähernd zu verstehen, 
&gt; 
&gt; Das ist eine Behauptung, die man auch schon vor 50 Jahren hätte machen können, nur waren damals Wahlbeteiligung und politisches Engagement viel höher als heute

Du scheinst, Engagement mit Organisationsgrad zu verwechseln: vor 50 Jahren folgte man dem Gewerkschafter oder Priester oder wem auch immer nach, heute will man selbst mitbestimmen, ohne dass man aber für diesen nun komplizierteren gemeinschaftlichen Willensbildungsprozess die nötigen Voraussetzungen, zuvörderst Realitätssinn und Kompromissbereitschaft, aufbringen könnte.  Gleichzeitig war die Welt vor 50 Jahren sehr viel einfacher zu durchschauen als heute, auch sehr viel langsamer.

&gt; &gt; dann ist sie das Resultat der politischen Selbstentmündigung des Großteils der Bürger (bzw. deren nie überwundener Unmündigkeit).
&gt; 
&gt; Abgesehen von der Arroganz dieser Behauptungen: hast du für diese 'Selbstentmündigung' irgendwelche Beweise?

Nun, Du schriebst doch selbst: »… Trivialisieren der Medien, deren politische Berichterstattung gegenüber früher deutlich an Qualität verloren hat.«  Warum hat sie denn an Qualität verloren?  Weil das intellektuelle Niveau der gesamten Gesellschaft gesunken ist, und sich dies eben in den Druckerzeugnissen widerspiegelt; tausende andere Symptome dieses Verfalls ließen sich nennen.  Es ist übrigens nicht so, dass es gar keine Zeitschriften mit höherem Anspruch gibt, nur liest die kaum jemand.  Und wenn gemeine Zeitungen das Niveau zu hoch ansetzen, verlieren sie ihre Leser.  »Der Kunde ist König«, sagt der Volksmund – also entscheidet er auch selbst, welche Zeitung er liest – deswegen Selbstentmündigung.

&gt; &gt; reagieren mit ohnmächtiger Wut darauf, dass andere dieses Spiel besser beherrschen,
&gt; 
&gt; Sie reagieren mit ohnmächtiger Wut auf sehr reelle Übel wie Arbeitslosigkeit, Einkommensverlust, mangelnde Mitbestimmung und drohenden Staatsbankrott. Wenn die Armen immer mehr und immer ärmer werden, was erwartest du von ihnen?

Ich erwarte von ihnen, dass sie einen kühlen Kopf behalten und sich fragen, ob wirklich mehr für sie drin ist, wenn sie dieser oder jener Partei die Stimme geben.  Ich erwarte von ihnen, dass sie auch unter verschärften Bedingungen nicht damit anfangen, aus Verzweiflung und Angst heraus ihre politischen Entscheidungen auf Wunschdenken zu gründen.  Und ich erwarte von ihnen, dass sie endlich realisieren, dass sie für die Entscheidungen ihrer Regierungen in Haftung genommen werden, und dass sie dementsprechend sich verhalten.

&gt; Sollen sie sich sagen, wie du meinst: ""ich bin zu dumm um mitzureden""?

Nein, sie sollen sich sagen: »Ich bin noch nicht klug genug, um mitzureden, deswegen will ich zuhören, lesen und mich bilden!«  Wenn wir die dummen Menschen z.B. dazu bringen könnten, Zeitschriften, die sie überfordern, wenn schon nicht zu lesen, dann doch wenigstens zu kaufen, haben wir vielleicht noch eine Chance.

Istrianism is, according to some, a politically motivated movement with the goal of establishing a supranational regional identity in the Croatian part of Istria [in an effort] to reduce the number of Croats.

&gt;Promiču ga političari koji rade na odvajanju Istre od ostatka Hrvatske, a za to im je potrebno dekroatizirati Istru. Hrvate se nagovara neka budu Istrijanima, a ne Hrvatima.[1] Prema viđenju mladog etnologa Sandija Blagonića tijekom 19. stoljeća seosko slavensko stanovništvo u Istri ne posjeduje hrvatski identitet nego se sastoje od brojnih skupina pozivajući se na stare populacije Bazgone, Bezjake, Šavrine, Ćiće i druge[2].

It is espoused by politicians who are working toward separating Istria from the rest of Croatia and to do this, it is necessary [for them] to de-Croatify Istria. Croats are told to be Istrians, not Croats. According to the young 19th century ethnologist Sandi Blagonić, the Slavic population in the Istrian countryside does not possess a Croat identity, but rather is composed of several different groups, citing populations of Bazgone, Bezjaki, Šavrina, Ćića, and other villages.

true,observer,EURO,European Union,"&gt; If your point was that certain segments of the Greek economy are overtaxed, as you indicate in your last paragraph, then, if true, this does not imply that you need to cut public expenses; you could just re-distribute the tax burden and keep the same revenue.

Let me reiterate: All I said was that effective taxation (and not just in the strict sense of 'effective tax=income tax+insurance contributions') is as high as it gets after being further increased during the crisis years. Tax revenues are not as high not because some sectors of the economy are not targeted or because the rates are comparatively low (as illustrated, we champion or at best are above average in most taxation categories) but due to widespread tax evasion and -as we have entered this protracted downturn- due to the reduced taxable income because of the recession (in part deepened by the increased taxation in the first place). Want to tackle tax evasion? Sure, it definitely needs to be done but it can only be achieved gradually as we restructure and improve our corrupt and ineffective tax collection mechanism. Since we needed to find more money in less time than that required for the aforementioned process to bear fruits our other options (unless you go for the grexit solution you mentioned) would either be to tax more those that are already taxed heavily, as established in my previous posts (and thus reduce our private sector even more), or to drastically cut public spending (want to take all wages down to the average private sector entry level job? fine. Want to layoff surplus staff, on top of the thousands guilty of wrongdoing and extra-ASEP hirings? Fine too. I'd go with the second approach but I guess you'd argue that there's no surplus staff and that in fact we need to hire more in which case the first approach can have the same fiscal outcome although it could mean harsher wage cuts). 

The first solution inevitably results in private sector layoffs, the second results -potentially- in public sector layoffs. There is no way around this. To me it is obvious that the different govts up to now have chosen the former (first and foremost in order to protect their political clientele). So to lament (and I’m quoting here from the same thread) that ‘After they fired/are about to fire the entire public sector, there can be no more firing. So the unemployment rate can't go further down’ and ‘The private sector still has lots of people to fire after the public sector is dead...’ as if the main sufferers up to now have been or are about to be the public sector workers is to me incomprehensible given that the public sector will have fired by the end of 2014 (5 years after the onset of the crisis) only 20,000 people (most of whom didn’t deserve to be civil servants to begin with) that will be replaced 1 by 1 by successful ASEP candidates. And if you count ‘not renewing’ fixed-term contracts as layoffs then you should count hiring 50,000 in fixed-term contracts as proper hirings (so the public sector will increase rather than decrease, even if we take into account those leaving for retirement that will be replaced with the 1:5 ratio).

If this isn’t enough of a demonstration for you that when a state is called to reduce its huge deficit it has a choice between which sector to protect more and this decision costs in jobs for the other one then I don’t see what will convince you. It’s important to note that I’m not arguing here about whether losing public jobs is preferable (although I hold this position and I’ve previously made the case for it by highlighting how taxation is at its upper limits for those who duly pay their taxes) but simply that protecting them has a cost in private jobs (as would the opposite have for public jobs/wages). If you don’t see this interrelation I don’t see why you aren’t proposing hiring the some 3 mil. private sector unemployed to public sector jobs.

1. It is the legal residents who give jobs to the illegals. They do not come ""here"" to do nothing, they come to work. If ""we"" are giving work to illegals then we are equally to blame.

2. They are likely to contribute to the economy in ways better than the permanent residents, if you give them permission to work and collect taxes. They come here, they work, they pay their taxes and then they leave. In the meantime, portion of their taxes has been used to build infrastructure which stays behind for the locals to enjoy. Also, they cannot claim benefits and even if they do, it would not be for long because the objective of 95% of them is to go back and live a better life in their country. Even if somebody stays for ever, after paying taxes, then how is that different than having one more kid born in the population?

3. Most countries would be more than happy to occupy new lands as a means of expansion but nobody is happy to expand the population by immigration.

4. The argument that ""they take our jobs"" should more likely be ""they take the jobs that we do not want to do"". Employers are happy to employ **legal** immigrants because they do a better job than the locals.

5. By giving them a chance in life, we help their country grow, which means that in the long run we can have more potential for exports.

6. We have most likely conquered and subsequently fucked their countries in the last millennium. We killed them, exploited them and their resources, we shoved them our governments, we divided their lands the way it suited us, we created or fuelled conflicts, we still support their oppressive governments, we still lent them money at hefty interest rates, but, we do not want them here.

7. We have relied on them as cheap labour for local jobs post-WWII and those who stayed back have helped shape our cultural diversity. Yet we suddenly do not want them. I dare any country to do a survey of how many jobs have ex-immigrants created in their country and pit it against how many illegal immigrants are working in their country right now.

When you force children to learn (often because its more convenient or easier to measure) you teach them not to use their creativity and curb their interest in learning for the love of learning.

This is like saying that if you move to China and insist that the chinese change their traditions, laws, and customs to suit the lifestyle you had in your home country, it would be justified. Immigrants come to the west to get away from the steaming pile that they left behind(usually). Once they're here, they waste no time in trying to turn our home countries into what they ran away from. The Indigenous people of europe shouldn't have to sacrifice their cultural dominance to appease the desires of foreigners. 

These people all have home countries where the laws and customs reflect their culture. You flood the U.S. with enough mexican immigrants, and it will become more like mexico. You flood the E.U. with enough Africans and Middle Easterners, the result will be more like those places. What do these countries have in common? More poverty, more violence, and less of anything resembling Western culture. 

TL;DR- Not all cultures are equal and they certainly don't have the same track records in creating wealth and happiness. hence, the reason people immigrate in the first place.

Katharevousa was never taken that seriously by the people, which is why it was abolished. More like the language used by far right hipsters and pensioneers . And to claim that Katharevousa had any impact on our view of ancient greece is absurd.  

&gt;from what I've read it left its mark on the language spoken today

fo' real?

&gt;Yes, but only about as much as Romania's culture and language is connected to ancient Rome.

Surely you meant Italy or something? Do you have about 59 different classes in your highschool dealing with the Ancient Romans? 

The language isn't the biggest link, the language is the smallest link, (despite the fact that a modern greek speaker can understand about 25-30% of an ancient text with no training. But in FYROM they can understand 100% of a bulgarian text but they don't understand Bulgarian so I guess I'm wrong!!!) it's a matter of how much we study Ancient Greece. 

Which is imo why we should ban teaching Ancient Greek from middle school and put more history/philosophy classes.


And that brings us to the question I asked above and got no answer for. Maybe you can answer it. Like I said my problem with FYROM, me being someone from Macedonia, is not what you people defending FYROM are insinuating. 

What copyright on history, they're free to claim that they are descendants of Ancient Greeks as a constitute of their nation. But you tell me, is this what they are doing? They could be like ""research shows that our nation comes from several historical constitutes, South Slavs, Illyrians, Ancient Greeks, [...]"". This is not their claim though is it?

Nobody since 100AD talks about Athenians, Spartans, Mascedonians, Thebans, everyone stopped doing that and talked about greeks. Except for the FYROM nationalist propaganda machine who rediscovered the wheel 2500 years later.

So, how is it possible that Ancient Macedonians self identified as Greeks (with historical and linguistical analysis also having a consensus that they were a greek tribe).
And now 2500 later, FYROM claims Ancient Macedonians were being full of shit. Or maybe drunk or they had been smoking crack or something (still glorious ancestors though). ANd then shout hail Alexander while burning greek flags. Doesn't this sound like a parody to you? How the fuck can you come from Ancient Macedonia and not Ancient Greece.

So it's not about  a copyright on history. It's about a distortion of history. I don't want to see American 14 yo on the internet dreaming about how FYROM should take revenge on Greece ""just like Alexander did"". Or tourists that look like a ww1 poster of the Perfect Slav tell me I am stealing their lands and Alexander will seek their revenge.",0,1379131905,null,0,1379132441,0,cc80hji,t3_1mauxd,t1_cc80hji,t1_cc7sp3h,null,1429469515,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

* 1 Our immigration policy already reflects this by fining businesses that employ illegal immigrants or those who don't have a right to work in the UK.

* 2 There are much more job seekers than jobs in our economy currently so its likely that if an illegal immigrant gets a job then that's a job that would otherwise have gone to a legal resident. If that's the case then its a net negative because the tax would have been collected anyway only you now have a legal resident on welfare and the person with the job is more likely to send money overseas rather than putting it back into the economy.

* 3 Not really sure what you're driving at here.

* 4 There are plenty of white British people willing to work hard or unpleasant jobs its just that illegal immigrants are willing to work those jobs for lower (and sometimes illegally low) wages.

* 5/6 are true but I think most people would agree that our immigration policy should be for the benefit of our country rather than some form of charity or reparations for imperialism.

* 7 What exactly do you mean by ""suddenly""? Immigration has been a source of tension since at least 1968 when Enoch Powell gave his rivers of blood speech. Moreover the benefits of legal post-war immigration have nothing to do with today's illegal immigrants.

* ""indigenous"" people are a privileged group whose culture should remain dominant

The United States, was founded by displacing whole nations of indigenous people with no regard for the extermination of their cultures.

* Some cultures are superior and are better suited to creating ""wealth and happiness""

I challenge you to find any evidence suggesting this. Very few countries attempt to measure the happiness of their citizens. Judging by levels of suicide, murder, and incarceration, I'd say there are a lot of unhappy people in the U.S.

But lets pretend for a moment its true and people are happier in the West. Even if this were true, there is no proof that western culture has a causal relationship with western happiness.

In the case of the U.S., there are many factors that lead to its success at ""creating wealth"". The first is the aforementioned annihilation of countless human beings. This gave the U.S. a vast expanse of land and all its natural resources. Next is undoubtedly the slave trade used to fuel American agriculture for generations. Following this period were waves of immigrants who could be exploited as wage slaves. Of course luck also plays a role as the U.S. ran into a great deal with the purchase of Alaska and and even cheaper deal by toppling the government of Hawai'i. At this point the U.S. began looking outwards- setting up a banana republic here, suppressing democracy there; and the foundation of the military industrial complex, prison industrial complex, getting into the international drug and weapons black markets, and creating the largest and most corrupt financial system in the history of the world.

So yes, I will concede that the U.S. has created a lot of wealth. Is the success of the U.S. caused by a superior culture? The answer is no.

 However, the Oktoberfest Non-Germans typically refer to happens to be not German, but Bavarian, and it is even typical for a certain region within Bavaria, namely Oberbayern/Munich. And that's where your alternatives become a bit tricky, as you suggest dropping the typical local food in favour of food that is traditionally neither very typical for Oktoberfest nor for the region of Oberbayern/ Munich.

For the cultural /culinary purist/traditionalist as well as for those who are proud of what their region has to offer, that might be a bit of a sacrilege - and for them, you might as well have suggested an Oktoberfest menu that includes Fondue as the main course and Tiramisu for dessert. 
Having said all that: OP would do fine with just Brezn and Bier, which happens to be both veggie AND very authentic;)

tl;dr: beer is veggie. Prosit!

Catalan independence is a symptom of a wider return to nationalism in Europe. IMO the results of such independence movements pose a threat to the established political structure in Europe and should therefore be discouraged. The only argument such movements have is rooted in nationalism anyway.

J'espère que les types qui ont cambriolé connaissaient les règles du jeu, que ce soit un bijoutier ou un flic, ils devaient s'attendre à prendre une balle. 
Et je ne pense pas que ce mouvement de soutien soit directement lié à la couleur de peau ou l'origine ou la culture de quelque parti que ce soit, bijoutier comme voleur.

Il n'est certes pas bon de soutenir une quelconque violence gratuite, mais que la question de légitime défense soit correctement élucidée ou pas dans ce cas, les personnes de toutes origines, toutes classes sociales semblent ressentir le besoin d'exprimer leur mécontentement quant à la recrudescence des actes violents et irrespectueux.

Pour avoir vécu à proximité des zones dites ""zonarisk"" (merci au [SSC](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xj819o_saian-supa-crew-zonarisk_music) !) de Toulouse et de la région Parisienne, je peux vous assurer que tout le monde crache, plus ou moins à haute voix, sa haine et sa peur de l'agresseur, quelque soit le visage qu'il incarne. Etrangement il n'y que les malfaiteurs eux même qui ne sont pas dérangés :D

J'ai l'impression de voir dans ce journalisme trop rapide et trop facile, une image de ces gens qui prônent le racisme lorsque de façon tout à fait raisonnable une personne en accuse une autre, malheureusement dans ce cas noire, de lui avoir volé sa télé. 

Sincèrement, le FN me donne des boutons, une partie de l'UMP aussi désormais, mais je trouve que les mouvements radicaux et le concept du racisme en lui-même ont bon dos de nos jour.

**TL;DR:**  Dans 80% des cas le raz le bol est généralisé à toutes les populations et tous les groupes politiques. Arrêtons de condamner l'extrême droite, qui le mérite pour d'autre raisons, quand les manifestants sont présents pour leurs convictions personnelles et afficher leur peur, engendrée par leurs expériences et bien souvent indépendante de leurs penchants politiques ou sociaux.

&gt; detrimental (...) to the continued peace in Europe

Europe hasn't been any more peaceful since the desintegration of the soviet bloc and Yugoslavia.

&gt; Catalan independence is a symptome of a wider return to nationalism in Europe

Usually the word nationalism gets mixed up with nazism or national-socialism, especially in Spain. Catalonia has always been ruled by democrats, always by moderate parties in their political spectrum. IT'S BEEN OUR [DEMOCRATIC LEADERS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llu%C3%ADs_Companys) WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED BY NAZIS or NATIONAL-CATHOLICISM (Francoist regime).When we, catalans, refer to ourselves as nationalistic, we like to think of [Civic Nationalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism#Civic_nationalism), I don't care where are you from, but I want you to feel like home and share our wonders with you. In the Catalan Way, I was in charge of 3km and 12 people, and I saw people speaking in Spanish, we had a volunteer from Italy and another one from Chicago, there was a sub-saharian guy running around with an Estelada proclaiming catalonian independence and everyone had a broad smile in their faces.

&gt; IMO the results of such independence movements pose a threat to the established political structure in Europe and should therefore be discouraged.

Not a biased opinion at all. Catalan independence movement is a pro-European movement, we want to be part of Europe, but not a Europe of States, but a Europe of Nations, I want to have my opinion heard before it gets silenced by the spanish government.

&gt; People should learn to get on with established realities instead of believing the grass is greener on the other side.

So, the Civil Rights Movement in the USA, the Storming of the Bastille, the Northern Ireland Peace Process or the Fall of the Berlin Wall shouldn't have happened, is that what you mean? I know it is not what you mean, but if everyone did as you said, this would be a more gray and shadowy world.

**Worum geht es?**

Unser Wirtschafts- und Gesellschaftssystem wird durch krisenhafte Entwicklungen zunehmend in Frage gestellt und eine Antwort ist nicht in Sicht. Die politischen und wirtschaftlich Mächtigen wurden zum Großteil an den besten Schulen und Universitäten ausgebildet. Ihre Ratlosigkeit ist deutlich zu spüren und an die Stelle einer langfristigen Perspektive ist kurzatmiger Aktionismus getreten.

Mit erschreckender Deutlichkeit wird nun sichtbar, dass uns die Grenzen unseres Denkens von Kindheit an zu eng gesteckt wurden. Egal, welche Schule wir besucht haben, bewegen wir uns in Denkmustern, die aus der Frühzeit der Industrialisierung stammen, als es darum ging, die Menschen zu gut funktionierenden Rädchen einer arbeitsteiligen Produktionsgesellschaft auszubilden. Die Lehrinhalte haben sich seither stark verändert und die Schule ist auch kein Ort des autoritären Drills mehr. Doch die Fixierung auf normierte Standards beherrscht den Unterricht mehr denn je.

Denn neuerdings weht an den Schulen ein rauer Wind. „Leistung“ als Fetisch der Wettbewerbsgesellschaft ist weltweit zum unerbittlichen Maß aller Dinge geworden. Doch die einseitige Ausrichtung auf technokratische Lernziele und auf die fehlerfreie Wiedergabe isolierter Wissensinhalte lässt genau jene spielerische Kreativität verkümmern, die uns helfen könnte, ohne Angst vor dem Scheitern nach neuen Lösungen zu suchen.

Erwin Wagenhofer begreift das Thema „Bildung“ sehr viel umfassender und radikaler, als dies üblicherweise geschieht. Fast alle Bildungsdiskussionen sind darauf verkürzt, in einem von Konkurrenzdenken geprägten Umfeld jene Schulform zu propagieren, in der die Schüler die beste Performance erbringen. Wagenhofer hingegen begibt sich auf die Suche nach den Denkstrukturen, die dahinter stecken. Was wir lernen, prägt unseren Wissensvorrat, aber wie wir lernen, prägt unser Denken.

Nach WE FEED THE WORLD und LETS MAKE MONEY ist ALPHABET der abschließende Teil einer Trilogie, der die Themen der beiden vorherigen Filme nochmals aufgreift und wie in einem Brennglas bündelt.

ALPHABET ist Erwin Wagenhofers bisher radikalster Film.

Even if 90% of Catalonians wanted independence then that 10% of people who wanted to remain Spanish would be losing their rights as Spanish citizens.

Spanish citizens won't lose their rights, because citizenship is granted when you are born and you can't be stripped from it. If Catalonia becomes an independent state, all their citizens will have dual citizenship, catalan-spanish, unless the Spanish Goverment decides that those holding Catalan citizenship can't have Spanish citizenship. I don't think that any catalan political party would do such thing.

&gt;Equally questions of migration and belonging are raised. Brussels for examples is a French speaking city in a Dutch speaking area, if Walloon wanted independence should they take Brussels with them?

Languages don't make borders, if so, Catalonia could claim the Rousillon, Valencia, Mallorca, the eastern part of Aragon and the city of Alghero in Sardinia.

&gt; What about more modern migrants, if cities in the South of France that had have majority North African and Arab populations are they entitled to vote and say they want to join Algeria?

Do they want to join Algeria? Most of the people in Catalonia are on a first, second or third grade Spanish immigrants and all of them have the right to vote as long as they are registered in the Town Council as living here.

&gt; Not to mention the inevitable technical problems with Balkanisation, in Croatia and Bosnia there are active movements to make their languages less illegible with each other - so ironically older parts of the language are more intelligible then more recent ones. Not to mention problems dividing state assets and the economic consequences of instability.

Spain and Catalonia aren't Croatia and Bosnia and any statement is pure conjecture. Catalan isn't Spanish and they parted ways from the Common Latin a millennia ago, so I don't see your point here. 

Dividing assets and instability, I don't really know, I expect we can end as friends and good neighbours. Instability? More than now? Maybe Spain is forced to get its shit together and make the needed changes to its nineteenth century conception of a state to a more modern one. Spain is a proud state living from its past glories that won't take shit from anyone, a weaker Spain is a stronger Europe.

I am going to make one last effort, with a quote that (I hope) will serve you to understand my position and my disregard towards your reactionary ideas.

“The cheapest sort of pride is national pride; for if a man is proud of his own nation, it argues that he has no qualities of his own of which he can be proud; otherwise he would not have recourse to those which he shares with so many millions of his fellowmen. The man who is endowed with important personal qualities will be only too ready to see clearly in what respects his own nation falls short, since their failings will be constantly before his eyes. But every miserable fool who has nothing at all of which he can be proud adopts, as a last resource, pride in the nation to which he belongs; he is ready and glad to defend all its faults and follies tooth and nail, thus reimbursing himself for his own inferiority.” - Arthur Schopenhauer

I also command you to learn what was the reasoning behind the idea of nation when it appeared, in which extent that reasoning is outdated and disproven, with essential parts of it, such as the idea that men are somehow different depending on where their direct ancestors came from (i.e. the idea of race), being thoroughly disproven by science and reason. We are all humans, we all strive to order our relations through law and the monopoly of force by the State. There is no reason for law to be different in different places of the globe separated by invisible lines, moreso when we, the subjects, are essentially equal. Nationalism is built upon a lie, and when people make it a valid political and legal concept that lie ceases to be petty and it becomes a full-fledged tool of totalitarism.

For example the English Wikipedia is biased towards the far liberal left due to the fact that most of its editors are from the USA and their universities and media are slanted that way, it's a disgusting hippie heritage and most young educated people think that way. 

That has made editing the English Wikipedia a very uncomfortable experience for me. Because I was used to the impartial and apolitical Czech Wikipedia and foolishly expected the same standard from Americans, an allegedly ""democratic"" nation. Don't be fooled, just as their political system isn't really democratic and free, so isn't the English Wikipedia. 

And have I mentioned that some admins on en.wiki are known to have taken bribes in exchange for making articles look the way their customers want? Google it.

like /u/carott said above, that is a 100% position before taxes. After taxes and social security you will end up with ~1200€ per month (assuming 50% position). It is enough to survive, but of course it depends on your standards. 1200€ is currently ~$1600 but don't get fooled by numbers since everything scales differently. 

In the bigger citites the rents went up the last decade. (a hot topic in the current pre-election bruhaha). So in bigger cities like Munich or Hamburg you will need min. 50% of your income just for rent (assuming 2 people). Berlin though, is actually quite cheap compared to the other major cities. But the rent in the more ""in"" areas will be crazily high as well.

For me, it is one of the reasons not to get a PhD although I was offered one. After 5 years of studying in an expensive city I'm done living on a student budget. But that is just my opinion, I don't want to discourage you. In fact, if you love what you do, then get a PhD regardless of the pay.

There are other possibly unexpected expenses as well.

Getting married before coming to Germany will make it easier for your wife to come and even cheaper (your health insurance could cover her while she has no income yet, for example).

How those ruling Spain have never hesitated in bombarding Barcelona from Montjuic or banning/disregarding our language, culture and/or needs, multiple dictatorships have passed by and all with the same effects on us.

I don't take pride because I am catalan, I take pride because I understand that we can do great things together, I take pride on organizing and taking part on a pacific 400km long chain across our territory and beyond our borders with absolutely no chants against Spain and  the only hope that someone will take some time to listen to us. I take pride on being from a country that has always raised on arms when it felt injustly treated and never hesitated to defend its basic rights.

I take pride in Catalonia where some geniuses like Dalí, Casals or Gaudí have been born, and some others like Picasso or George Orwell felt like in a second home. The same way that an english citizen may feel proud of sharing language with Shakespeare, Dickens or Hemingway.

I don't take pride from the fact that some of our political class is corrupt, I don't take pride when some members from the Left Independentist movements engage in petty revenge burning spanish/french/EU flags or pictures of the Spanish King. I am not like that.

My will to constitute myself and my friends within a different State is the fact that I know my history and how Castile has always subverted the difference by force and uniformism. How the Spanish project is not that of the Kingdoms of Spain, but those of the Imperial Castile. You may want to read how the Tercios showed their ""Furia"" in the low countries when the protestant majority raised against injustice. Or how the Reapers raised their sickles into the air to battle for the integrity and respect of their laws. Or how the Catalans sided with Philip IV during the Spanish War of Succesion but when seeing how Philip IV wanted to abolish their laws and rights, and apply those of Castile, changed sides in favor of archduke Charles. You may want to read from the Primo Rivera's and Franco's dictatorship and its repression against anything that was different. You may want to read how many members in the Spanish Government have ties with the Franco Regime. You may want to read how our actual king was imposed by Franco and no one was asked about. You may want to read about how the constitution was approved because it was an all-or-nothing and even then, the military tried to revolt in the 23th of february of 83 taking the Parliament. Right now, there is more people who voted in favor of said constitution buried than alive. You may want to read how one of those who stormed into the Generalitat's building, in Madrid this 11th of September, is cousin of the Minister of Defence and brother-in-law of the second-in-charge of the Spanish Intelligence Agency.

You may want to read about how established are facist groups conniving with the political and order powers in Spain, an exception is Catalonia once Mossos de Esquadra replaced Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil, they were kicked out of football stadiums, pursued and ostracised.

You may say that you know me, but you probably don't, I totally agree with Schopenhauer, nationalism is a reaction that have no-value in themselves. Catalonia is one of the last territories subverted by Castile by the law of fire and blood, by the right of conquest. Castile has lost Portugal, Cuba, Philippines, Flandes, Mexico, Colombia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Perú, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuatorial Guinea, most of Morrocco and Chile during its history and I just want to join them in that list.

true,canard_glasgow,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;That seems to be quite intellectually dishonest, and a bit of a cowardly way to fight the UK's refusal to more deeply integrate in the Union.

I think a distinction needs to be made between the interests of the UK and the interests of those that live in the UK. They are not aligned. Our current system of government is the result of an incredibly conservative 300 years that has sought to preserve every self interest over that time. Voters are given a binary choice between two near indistinguishable options and policies are made in exactly this boolean manner. You accept and support what party X does, even if you are opposed in principle, because opposition equates to agreement with the other guy. 

The second chamber is dedicated to the Lords, no pretensions at hiding the vested interests. The head of state is the chief inbred of inbreds. The limited democratic input to the House of Commons is presented as false choices in a voting system rigged to support the status quo. The oversight against lobbying is minimal. The press is controlled by the few, representative of the few and frames debate to the advantage of the few.

So, Westminster, and its approach to Europe, and the approach in the press towards Europe is to serve the interests of the few. I refuse to accept it has any legitimacy in claiming to represent the interests of British citizens. Where Westminster interest overlap the citizens it is by coincidence or forced upon by self preservation. 

A European democracy is a threat to Westminster dominance and is never going to be accepted. The only way forward is to get rid of Westminster. 

Reform has been promised for decades, and the little that emerged in the form of devolution was quickly stifled and made clear that this was to be a Celtic exception, not something that would be allowed to evolve to challenge Westminster's authority. 

So, now Scotland has the opportunity to leave the UK and its borked democracy, and the powers that be accuse this attack on their self interest as nationalism and selfish in a hypocrisy so blatant it is staggering . 

The UK must be reformed as a whole! Nationalistic as it is implicit that the UK is somehow an indivisible unit. The divide and conquer technique so successfully practiced on the British isles ensures that it never becomes a possibility.

It is selfish to leave England under Tory rule! Everyone plays the game or no one does. It is an admission that England is poorly served by Westminster, and a threat against them that Westminster will really hurt them if Scotland leaves. Pathetic.

&gt;What?

Romulus Augustulus was dethroned but his life was spared because he was a child.

&gt;Foederati did not get citizenship. They were barbarian tribes who were given the right to settle on Roman land in return for military service. The Eastern Empire employed this system as well.

It's interesting that the premise undergirding the person's argument is that people with higher academic credentials are better equipped for life. I would challenge that idea. I think that the northern continental European systems of allowing children to pursue their aspiration in life early is a much healthier way of doing things. You can compare that to what we have in the USA, where everybody goes through the same type of academic tertiary school. It doesn't make people smarter. It just delays the chance for young people to actually start pursuing their personal dreams. There was a fascinating article that I read in a German publication a couple of months ago comparing the Germans and the Greeks. The Greeks have very high ratings in academic achievement according to OECD rankings... yet their economy is a failure. The Germans on the other hand have the opposite situation.

I believe the only approach that could eventually succeed in improving integration is that of finding common ground while acknowledging each other's right to live as they want, as long as it's done within the legal framework.

The world, as far as I know, was experiencing some sort of economic recover after the years of the Great Depression, and Latvia benefited from that recovery.

Furthermore, if we look at the political consequences of Ulmanis, they were terrible. My great grandfather was one of those sent to the Liepāja concentration camp, which was nothing compared to the camps of Stalin and Hitler, and he spent only a few months there, but Ulmanis, in his moves to consolidate power, absolutely gutted most civic groups, censored and controlled the media, etc. Then, when the Russians came in, Latvia had no real civil society (pilsoniski aktīva sabiedrība) that could dispute and resist the occupation.

Ulmanis might have been good at some things, but he definitely wasn't good at everything - most commentators that I've read have said that he was naive and inexperienced with foreign affairs.

Simply put, when you're relying on ONE PERSON to make all the heavy decisions in a country, then everything depends on that ONE PERSON. And every person is only human - with their strengths and their weaknesses.

On a psychological level, a dictator removes the feeling of responsibility from people. It makes the attitude of society infantile - ""Oh, well, Great Father (Ulmanis' nickname) knows best, so whatever he tells me to do, I'll do it, but I'm not responsible for it, because *he* told me/made me do it...""

Like German soldiers after WWII - ""I was only following orders.""

The key to a healthy democracy is empowering people through education, economic possibilities, and political freedom.

Ultimately, you can only change your own attitudes and actions - you can't really ""make"" other people change theirs. It all starts with you, the individual, the citizen. Your actions contribute to - or degrade - the society you live in.

* Everyone agreed the powers were such that they warranted a referendum  
* The French and the Dutch clearly rejected handing over those powers  
* The process *requires* unanimity of states, not a majority of ""Europeans"" (I haven't seen anything that proves a majority in the latter case anyway)  
* Some cosmetic changes were made with many senior europhiles and eurosceptics all accepting it was an identical set of powers  
* Senior europhiles even confessed they did it so they wouldn't have to offer a referendum to get the same things  
* The French and the Dutch ended up having powers taken from them they had clearly said they didn't want to hand over  
* Thus powers which people agreed required a referendum, and unanimity, were stolen in an anti-democratic fashion  

There's no way to get around those quotes, I suspect you haven't even read them. And, by the way, we will accept the results of a free and fair referendum if people vote to stay, it's a risk we're willing to take. On the other hand the europhiles are not willing to accept any loss and will do anything to obtain power.  

You can keep spinning it till you are blue in the face but those powers required a referendum and unanimity. Making an argument on legal technicalities is like someone trying to justify what Cromwell did in Ireland just because it was 'legal'. The moral and democratic arguments trump the kind of lawyering you are engaging in. But feel free to continue arguing other people shouldn't have referendums when your constitutional court said it was necessary for the Irish to have one, and when all the europhile proponents said in the past that referendums would be necessary for these powers in other countries, and when they even put these powers to referendums in the past. Your argument is morally and democratically bankrupt, and you know it, which is why you don't defend the morality or the democracy and only focus on your twisted technicalities.

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"Lol, more like hypocritical bullshit. Latvia is small enough to where it does not suffer from any notable separatist regions. Therefore all of the sudden it feels very gracious with things like these. Any country that is large enough to house some separatist movements that may even pose a serious threat generally don't go around telling other separatist movements that they're totally great. 

Now yeah, I am Russian and yeah, I've got obvious bias. Thing is though, Russia will rarely support a separatist movement unless it is a huge benefit to us (separatist movement inside a rival polity). Latvia has no grievance with Spain, so I would politely ask the Latvian PM to shut his mouth because I can already feel Spain's ire at such a bullshit statement. 
****
Personally I dislike separatist movements even when it is to my country's strategic advantage. Especially when such small regions try to do this. I cannot help but think that far too many people like separatism because there are those ambitious few at the top who covet new posts to be corrupt in, so they push the people for 'independence' so that they can get those lucrative posts. This somewhat happened in the USSR in 1991. The new constitution outlining the plan of a truly federal SSR was popularly supported in almost every republic's first democratic voting process. However the hardliners stepped in with their coup. Here is where it got tricky. If the hardliners hadn't initiated their coup, the transition would have likely worked and although there is no telling how long after that the union would last, it would still exist for at least some measure of time. If the hardliners had actually gone through with their coup and released the military to quash the public outcry, they would have preserved the USSR as well. 

However, the hardliners turned out to be not so hard-line and they backed down, sabotaging both options. In truth the new constitution that was voted in could have still gone through (without the Baltic states who declined it, rather understandable) but alas the greedy politicians in the republics decided that the prospects of having their own little fiefdoms of corruption were more appealing than having to at least somewhat answer to some higher overseeing power.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"Shrug. Again, you're simply wrong. Only two EU states even have a legal trigger for a referendum - Denmark and Ireland. In every other state referendums are non-binding political PR exercises - bar France, where they're a binding political PR exercise.

So *only* in Denmark and Ireland can an EU treaty trigger an obligatory referendum, and only where it's determined that the treaty impacts sovereignty. In Denmark, the Constitution would have had a referendum, but their *courts* - not their politicians - ruled that Lisbon did not. In Ireland, it wasn't put to the courts, because the politicians decided to hold a referendum as usual rather than run the risk of the courts ruling it required on after the fact as they originally did with the SEA. That means of the two legal triggers that actually exist for referendums in the EU, Lisbon triggered one, and was judged in a constitutional court not to trigger the other.

So the claim that ""everyone agreed the powers were such that they warranted a referendum"" isn't a ""quote"", but made-up bollox that suits your agenda. There's no ""they"" to agree such a general principle as ""the powers justify a referendum"", there's no *way* to agree it, and it's not even *possible* for it to be true in 25 out of 27 member states. But, hey, I somehow think that's not going to make you drop the claim.

The use of referendums for the Constitution was a PR exercise intended to show ""European solidarity"" - again, only in Denmark, France, and Ireland could the result have been legally binding, and in many states there wasn't going to be even a non-binding referendum because those states have rather painful memories of referendums (particularly Germany and Italy). Sure, it was indeed decided not to try the same thing a second time, but it wasn't a case of sneaking the Constitution through legal triggers by rebadging it Lisbon, but of not engaging in a rather hubristic bit of PR. You cannot sneak something through legal triggers that don't exist.

All of this goes whoosh, apparently. You prefer cherry-picked 'quotes' which are actually your interpretation (or someone else's) of partial quotes, and you know nothing at all about the constitutional architecture of other European countries - which is slightly sad given that's what you're theoretically dedicated to preserving from the ravages of the EU, although I guess you'd say that it's up to them to defend their own democracy...except where by doing so they might benefit you, in which case it becomes a 'solidarity' issue suddenly.

As to the outcome of referendums - again, I'm afraid a referendum only answers the question on the paper. Nobody - least of all a foreign observer like yourself - can say the ""French and the Dutch ended up having powers taken from them they had clearly said they didn't want to hand over"" because that's an interpretation of the result that suits your agenda. All they said was ""No"" - ""why not"" isn't on the ballot paper.

I don't have  an answer for that. But we  are getting the three things  now. Longer working days. lower salaries and lay-offs. 

&gt; Same thing, decent housing for all sounds nice

There are three millions and half of empty house  ready to be inhabited. A lot of them in cities. Spain doesn't have a problem of lack  of housing. The problem is  that there isn't people that can afford to live in those houses.

&gt; If someone loans another persons money to buy a house but cannot pay the loan like agreed it is more than logical to let the lender have the house.

That's the reason why the number of empty houses has increased in half million since the end of the construction bubble. Spain is the country of the houses without people and people without houses. And it's not only mortgages, with a 27% of unemployment many people can't pay the rent or the utilities.

We are paying energy companies to maintain energy plants that are not used because the economy that used them disappeared, we  are giving bailouts to banks that own the houses where nobody lives. We  are asking to evicted people to keep paying mortgages when they don't have a house or anything.

I don't think that this nun has a solution, but the things are happening  at Spain have to stop.

Certes, on parle immigration et insécurité depuis une bonne trentaine d'années maintenant, mais avec gène et des pincettes. Depuis une dizaine d'années, les esprits ont de moins en moins de mal à aborder ces thèmes et ils le font avec plaisir (c'est la fameuse rhétorique ""contre la bienpensance""). L’extrême droite a gagné la bataille culturelle, des mouvements comme le Bloc Identitaire s'en vantent allègrement... Et tout cela profite électoralement au FN. 

Alors qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ? On connait le crédo de l'extrême droite, à savoir tout cela serait le retour de bâton de l'incompétence de cette entité fantasmagorique, ""l'UMPS"". Surement y a-t-il derrière un certain statu quo une frustration populaire très fructueuse à récolter. Mais cette victoire idéologique, je la vois prise surtout sous l'impulsion des faiseurs d'opinion. Zemmour par exemple a, je pense, joué un grand rôle m en tant que tribune pour le populisme démagogique de droite radicale. La ligne Buisson cachée derrière Sarkozy a eut son effet, surement le plus pernicieux puisqu'il se jouait au sommet de l'Etat. Plus récemment et marginalement (quoi que...), Dieudonné, Soral et consort contribuent à alimenter quotidiennement un climat de ressentiment, d'indignation,  et de révolte aveugle. 

Donc oui, face à tout cela, la gauche est dépitée. Elle a du mal à comprendre comment nombre de français peuvent joindre leurs idées et leurs voix à de tels courants. On essaye de pointer du doigt, on a beau essayer de montrer les connivences et les héritages historiques et intellectuels, tout le monde s'en fout car ca parait trop loin et trop compliqué. Peu importe que le FN ait été fondé par des restes de Vichy et des partisans putschistes d'Algérie, ca ne ranime tout juste que de vagues souvenirs du collège. 16,86% en 2002 se sont pourtant portés sur quelqu'un qui revendique avec plaisir les méthodes de l'armée française en Algérie, pour y avoir lui-même participé. Effacement des repères, flou des valeurs, l'électeur ne vote que pour l'instant présent, les enjeux du moment. 

Pendant ce temps, nous, on observe, dépité. Plus d'un million de personnes sur Facebook font l'apologie de la transgression de l'Etat de droit. On crie à la justice personnelle, au port d'armes, à la mort des délinquants et des criminels. La société française s'américanise ou quoi ? C'est la crise hein, c'est la crise, alors tout est permis. Chacun pour soi, on se replie, tant pis pour l'autre, il a intérêt à ne pas trop s'approcher de moi.

&gt; I will also point out you brought nazism into the discussion and, it being uncalled and out of place, that means you have already lost this argument, publicly exposing your inability to reason.

Since we're talking about nationalism, mentioning national socialism isn't out of place at all. It is actually you who's unable to reason if you think that by mentioning the Nazis, someone's lost their argument automatically.

I disagree with Schopenhauer's argument, it's is a far stretch to assume that just because someone's proud of their nationality implies they have nothing else to be proud of. One can be proud of multiple things at the same time. If my children grew up to be good people and at the same time I've lead a successful, fulfilling career, I cannot be proud of both being a good parent and of my professional career? Do I have to choose only one? I understand why you could argue being proud of just being part of a large group of people by coincidence isn't something someone might (or might not be) proud of, but that Schopenhauer's argument rests on the idea that one cannot be proud of multiple qualities at once.

Being proud of being a part of a nation, also, doesn't mean one is blind to the nation's shortcomings or defending them as qualities. Most people who are proud of being X can also notice the negative aspects of their group and some will even work to change that.

Not to mention Schopenhauer contradicts himself, if being part of a nation isn't something one may or may not be proud of, then a nation may not even have ""faults and follies"", because it's just a coincidental group of people, in which individuals only share any qualities or faults by accident. Thus, there are no faults and follies to defend tooth and nail.

&gt; the idea that men are somehow different depending on where their direct ancestors came from (i.e. the idea of race), being thoroughly disproven by science and reason.

That's completely untrue, people do actually differ depending on geography (where their ancestors came from). This is due to natural selection. Of course, an African person whose parents are white won't be born black, but their some of their ancestors have come from Europe - and not that long ago, those ancestors that define the newborn's skin colour have been born in Europe *after* Europe has been colonised by humans. People in different regions have developed vastly different cultures and customs and nationalism strives to defend and develop those. 

&gt; There is no reason for law to be different in different places of the globe separated by invisible lines

Yes, there is. The reason that laws are different in different places is due to the fact that laws are written to solve what the specific society sees as problems, according to that society's shared values. It's okay to disagree with any specific invisible line, which is precisely what gives secessionist movements their legitimacy.

&gt; Nationalism is built upon a lie, and when people make it a valid political and legal concept that lie ceases to be petty and it becomes a full-fledged tool of totalitarism. In that respect, it is as poisonous and insulting to the individual as state religion once was.

Nationalism wasn't built upon a lie, but I've already said this. Every form of government must be somewhat totalitarian, there will always be insulted individuals. You've mentioned that ""we all strive to order our relations through law and the monopoly of force by the State"" (I didn't expect such a blanket assumption from someone as individualist as you), but the only way to run an effective government is to group people according to geography - since laws regulate the relations between physical individuals, it only makes sense to group them by the virtue of them being somewhat close physically. It doesn't matter how you group and sub-group individuals, you *must* do it, and all societies do it. In the West we have states, which sometimes share governance (e.g. the EU), and delegate their power to a sub-grouping (e.g. counties). Those sub-groups divide themselves into even smaller groups, delegating some more responsibility to the lower level. Eventually you have family units, where the parents exercise authority over their children, while affording them some freedoms according to fundamental human rights, the law, and the *culture* the family lives in. Notice how this division is purely through geography and resources: the only way a child may truly refuse their parents authority over them is if they can afford their own resources and if they don't live in their parents' house. Otherwise, even if the child is legally an adult, the parent can force their authority over them purely through controlling their access to resources (the parent can tell the adult child to do something, otherwise the parent won't pay for the child's food or will kick them out of the house). 

Your argument for extreme individualism simply lead to anarchism. Uncontrolled anarchy very quickly leads to the rule by the strongest and the subjugation of the many, it is as totalitarian as any other system. Anarchy with some system of control, even if it's purely voluntary, is not anarchism. Any system will lead to some sort of control over the individual, and a democracy based on civic nationalist principles seems like quite a peaceful, stable way to run a government. Grouping people according to a shared culture and language seem like the best thing we've implemented so far.

Just to mention, I'm also opposed to claiming pride over the actions or qualities of others; I don't feel proud to be part of my nation or anything of the sort. I'm only proud of my own accomplishments.

true,sir_wolfie,EURO,Union européenne,"&gt;Your interpretation of democracy is restricted to ""people voting en masse""  

The people being sovereign is not an unreasonable definition of democracy actually. So I'll go with that when people are clearly abusing procedures to try to subvert it. I've already said I'll accept the result of a free and fair referendum in the UK, so you can stop ranting about my supposed preference for democracy only when it suits me. It's the europhile side of the debate which only accepts democracy when it suits them.  

The moral point wasn't to do with anyone trying to persuade you to vote one way or another (I hope I am still allowed to try to persuade people online). The moral point was to say that regardless of the legal technicalities these people were trying to subvert the will of the people. /u/Bowgentle thinks that the 2005 treaty and Lisbon are entirely different, contrary to the statements of several EU heads of state *and the drafters of both documents* who have confessed they did it to stop the referendums. That's the moral case at issue. You avoid it because you haven't a leg to stand on there, the quotes are numerous and crystal clear. Again I suspect you didn't even read them.  

You simply are content with the way things are after your side pulled a series of sinister legal moves. I don't dispute you successfully subverted democracy in some pseudo-legal manner for the time being. But don't pretend it wasn't a cynical plot designed to get around the fact they couldn't succeed with the referendums they promised to hold, and did hold in two cases.  

You just keep on ranting on entirely different points and technicalities because you are defending a pile of filth.

Da hast du recht, macht es aber nicht besser. Das sie dabei gegen sonst geltende Gesetze verstoßen ist dennoch ein Grund sich zu beschweren.

&gt;Die Dienste aufzulösen (auch, wenn nur im Scherz gemeint, hoffe ich) wäre eine ziemlich schlechte Lösung.

Nein, es war kein Scherz. Sie liefern nichts ausser einen Skandal nach dem anderen und haben eher eine aufbauende als präventive Rolle was deutschen Terrorismus angeht. Man könnte es z.b. durch einen Open Intelligence+ Analyse Dienst ersetzen.

&gt;Wenn mir ein Innenminister, eine Bundeskanzlerin oder ein Kontaktmann des Parlaments für die Geheimdienste mir sagt, dass sie keine Ahnung von den Vorgängen hatten, dann kann ich ihnen nur den Vogel zeigen - entweder sie sind nicht geeignet, ihre Arbeit zu erledigen oder sie lügen, dass die Balken krachen.[..] Im Grunde sind die politischen Beamten in den höheren und passenden Positionen und Politiker, denen die Geheimdienstarbeit zugetragen wurde, dafür verantwortlich, dass alles im gesetzlichen Rahmen bleibt.

Ich glaube das sie z. T. ahnen können was die Geheimdienste treiben, aber sie keine volle Kontrolle haben. Eine effektive Geheimdienstkontrolle ist de facto nicht möglich. Das sollte nun hinlänglich über die letzten 60 Jahre bewiesen sein. Selbst das PKG muss sich im Großen und Ganzen schlicht darauf verlassen das die Geheimdienste ihnen schon alles vollständig und wahrheitsgetreu mitteilt. Eine wirkliche Kontrolle sieht anders aus und ein reines Vertrauen reicht mir persönlich nicht aus. Gerade nicht nachdem eine Behörde schon mehrfach vorher gezeigt hat, das sie dieses Vertrauen (und Gesetze) bricht.

Such assumptions should be made explicitly. Second, you correctly suggest that overtaxing can lead to lower economic activity but at the same time you completely ignore that government spending generates demand. Is the decrease in generated demand compensated by the ""more freedom to create jobs"" by lowering taxes? It's debatable and not at all obvious. But your claim is much stronger than that: you suggested that it is not only compensated but that lowering taxes would save hundreds of thousands of jobs. You have presented no evidence for that. The only evidence we have on this front is IMF admitting that austerity in spending perpetuates the recession/depression and makes it worse. 

As an aside, I think you misunderstood what that other guy and I meant when we said ""After they fired/are about to fire the entire public sector, there can be no more firing. So the unemployment rate can't go further down"" and ""The private sector still has lots of people to fire after the public sector is dead..."".

So that's not when the decline started.

&gt;Barbarians were granted foederati status, not citizenship.

All non-slaves withing the Roman Empire were given citizenship by [Constitutio Antoniniana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutio_Antoniniana). No need to argue this. The status you're talking of came into play later.

&gt;Odoacer held power over the entire italian peninsula alongside Dalmatia but he was never king.

Right which is pretty much the same as king. And [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer) gives him the title king of Italy.

&gt;Living standards following the collapse of the Western Empire remained the same. What you meant to say, I'm assuming, is that the collapse of central authority led to a move away from the highly centralised urban gatherings seen before.

Yeah and Romans were pretty rich and non-hungry before the fall of Rome. The barbarian's standards remained the same.

&gt;The numerous kingdoms that sprouted up following the collapse of the Western Empire recognised Roman law and made claims to continuity.

Maybe so but they hardly obeyed it. And people had no rights, they were just toys in the hands of their vassals. 

&gt;Hello.

At least every Roman citizen had the right of trial.

&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vr2bg/theories_how_advanced_would_the_world_be_if_the/

Discoveries of the Middle ages were existent but their number lower than during Roman times, mainly because people were afraid that they would be burned if they spoke against God. So take the Middle Ages' discoveries, double them and that's what you get without Middle Ages, don't simply put them aside. Because you see, if there were no Middle Ages the people who made discoveries would still do them but a lot more people would be trying.

&gt;How are they any different from the numerous roman wars of conquest?

Rome's conquers brought light and civilization and education to the conquered tribes. The crusades were just bloody meaningless wars.

&gt;Numerous people died because of religion during the Roman Empire

True that, but killing people because of their religion was not common practice in Rome, but rather some anger or madness of some Emperor. Read about the Pantheon. They welcomed all religion, normally with some exceptions. Killing people with no reason(I mean at least Nero killed the Christians with some explanation-he said the set Rome on fire) was done on a daily basis in the Middle Ages.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian

That plague happened after the Western Roman Empire's fall, thus in the Middle ages. And even if it were in the Roman Empire you can't possibly compare it to the later plague that killed something among the lines of 70% of Europe's population. Truth is Romans had canalization, took baths and actually didn't kill doctors for being wizards.

It's bullshit in the sense that you're being politically unwise. Yes, there is a strong francoist (let's avoid using the blanket term fascist to describe an uprising that ranged from christian conservatives to carlists) influence in our politics, in the same way there is a strong republican influence. In Germany I don't think it's unlikely that a few small town mayors (let's face it, the examples you provide are small town mayors, political nobodies) secretly identify with Nazism...the system happens to be more skewed against the public expression of such views but it doesn't mean that these sympathies exist. In any case, it is largely unimportant. Maybe it's a scandal to you...I don't give a fuck if the mayor of baralla worships Franco, Stalin, Satan or the Bananas in Pajamas...that's a problem for the citizens of Baralla who elected him, and if they democratically choose to have that kind of retard as their public representative, that's their problem and not symptomatic of national problems as a whole. The unemployment figures are very high. Why you think this would be a melodrama is beyond me (perhaps your english is less than perfect and you simply misused the word. I assume this is in fact the case, not a problem). We do actually have a good democracy. You misunderstand the definition of democracy. A good democracy is not one in which the politicians elected carry out actual change, or in which government policy agrees with tutuscan's view of the world. A good democracy is one in which all are allowed to vote for their political preference freely and without fear of repercussion, and these votes are equally tallied to award political power. What you describe is a problem of CITIZENSHIP and EDUCATION. Don't blame the PP or PSOE. Blame those who fail to realise how mediocre these parties are and continue to vote to keep them in power. Don't blame the idiot mayor of Beade. Blame the people of Beade who voted him in. This Spanish habit of being snidely negative about the nation to make ones-self look more intellectual or clued-in than average is detrimental to political progress. This constant hailing of other nations over Spain ""we're such a third-world country, this would never happen in Germany"" etc. achieves nothing except to make you look like a whiner. I'm sure politically we actually see eye to eye on many if not most issues, but I think you are approaching the matter in completely the wrong way. It's time for Spaniards to put the past behind them (THE CIVIL WAR WAS ALMOST A FUCKING CENTURY AGO AND MANY SUFFERED ON BOTH SIDES), to choose action over complaint, and to realise their responsibility as citizens of a democracy (be informed. know your interests and beliefs. know the politicians standing, and their records. vote accordingly).

All the rest of the bluster about ""subverting democracy through sinister legal moves"" boils down to not accepting that demonstrable fact.

Nobody promised to hold referendums for Lisbon (Sarkozy specifically promised not to), only two countries could have been legally required to do so - one of them decided to hold it without referring the question to the courts, the other referred the question to the courts and the courts ruled a referendum wasn't needed.

&gt;Also, seit 1 Jahr ungefähr wird in der Bw nach dem nSAK ausgebildet, das heißt man weicht vom alten ""Ziele auf 200m punktgenau bekämpfen"" auf ein gegen irreguläre Kräfte angepasstes ""Ziele auf max 50m bekämpfen"" aus.

In Afghanistan sind die die Kampfentfernungen oft wesentlich weiter als 50 oder auch 200 m, was schon bei anderen NATO-Staaten zur Kritik am  Kaliber 5,56 mm geführt hat. 

http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/future%20small%20arms.htm

&gt;Before the Afghan conflict began, it was assumed that small-arms engagements would continue to take place within the traditional 300 metre limit, as they had in Iraq, and ISAF forces were equipped accordingly. The rifles and LMGs carried by the infantry on foot patrols were overwhelmingly in 5.56mm calibre, using the NATO standard SS109/M855 ammunition. The US forces used three principal weapons: the M16 rifle (favoured by the USMC), M4 Carbine (increasingly favoured by the US Army because its compactness makes it more suitable for urban fighting, the typical scenario in Iraq) and the M249 development of the FN Minimi LMG. Some 7.62mm weapons, most notably the M240 (FN MAG variant) and also some sniper and marksman rifles, were available for use in a support role when required. The British patrols used the L85A2 rifle, L86A2 Light Support Weapon (effectively an IAR) and the L110 LMG (FN Minimi Para). As with the US forces, the L7 GPMG (FN MAG) was available in support, and bolt-action 7.62mm sniper rifles were also in service.

&gt;These arrangements were thrown into disarray when faced with the very different circumstances of Afghanistan, where the Taliban noted the range limitation of the 5.56mm weapons and, wherever the terrain permitted, increasingly opted to engage ISAF troops from longer ranges. They could do this because as well as the ubiquitous but short-ranged AK family of assault rifles in 7.62x39 calibre, they have weapons chambered in the powerful Russian 7.62x54R round, equivalent in performance to the NATO 7.62x51. The principal weapons using this cartridge are the lightweight PKM belt-fed LMG and the Dragunov semi-automatic rifle. Both the British and US forces have reported that more than half of Taliban small-arms attacks are launched from ranges greater than 300 metres, out to as far as 900 metres. While the 5.56mm NATO weapons were previously claimed to be effective out to 450-600 metres, combat experience has shown that their performance falls off sharply beyond 300m - or even less, when used in short-barrelled weapons.",0,1379190301,null,0,false,0,cc8cl5z,t3_1mdrg6,t1_cc8cl5z,t1_cc8c4n9,null,1429463577,5,false,de,t5_22i0,5

Ich gebe dir Recht, dass in der Schießausbildung alter Art der Durchschnittstyp mit dem G36 Ergebnisse erzielt, die er mit einem G3 nicht erzielt hätte. Das steht völlig außer Frage, gerade bei Entfernungen um 200m. Aber diese Schießausbildung stellte auch den Präzisionsschuß in den Mittelpunkt. Demzufolge wurde auch das G36 daran ausgerichtet. Die Entwicklung ist ja auch schon älter. Wie du richtig sagst, stellt man jedoch nun fest, dass man 1. kürzere Kampfentfernungen hat und 2. Feuerstöße die Regel sind und keine Präzisionsschüsse. 

Somit ist die Schlußfolgerung die Waffe sei top, evt. zutreffend, wenn wir über einen G3 Nachfolger im Kalten Krieg sprechen. In den derzeitigen Einsätzen ist dies jedoch mit Fragezeichen zu versehen. Es kommt nicht von ungefähr, dass die Fallschirmjägerbataillone seit Jahren wieder G3 ZF mitnehmen und schon ein DMR in 7,62 eingeführt wurde (über die Leistungsfähigkeit der 5,56 Munition haben wir hier noch garnicht gesprochen).

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"&gt;All non-slaves withing the Roman Empire were given citizenship by Constitutio Antoniniana. No need to argue this. The status you're talking of came into play later.

The foederati status had existed since the time of the Republic. The Social Wars were caused by it. 

&gt;Right which is pretty much the same as king.

Being a ruler is not the same as being a king. Obama is the ruler of the USA, does that mean he is its monarch? Of course not. Odoacer never held the title of king and never proclaimed himself as such. By law, he ruled what remained of the Western Roman Empire as a regent subservient at first to Julius Nepos and later to Zeno. 

&gt;And Wikipedia gives him the title king of Italy.

Wikipedia is wrong. 

&gt;Yeah and Romans were pretty rich and non-hungry before the fall of Rome. The barbarian's standards remained the same.

What led you to believe the collapse of the empire led to widespread famines and loss of wealth? Life changed very little for the people of western europe. The wealth of Rome was always in the hands of a priviledged few. 

&gt;Maybe so but they hardly obeyed it.

And you base that on what? 

&gt;And people had no rights, they were just toys in the hands of their vassals. 

And before they were toys in the hands of the richmen of Rome.  What's your point?

&gt;At least every Roman citizen had the right of trial.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigothic_Code

&gt;Discoveries of the Middle ages were existent but their number lower than during Roman times, mainly because people were afraid that they would be burned if they spoke against God. So take the Middle Ages' discoveries, double them and that's what you get without Middle Ages, don't simply put them aside. Because you see, if there were no Middle Ages the people who made discoveries would still do them but a lot more people would be trying.

Do you have any sources to corroborate these claims? 

&gt;Rome's conquers brought light and civilization and education to the conquered tribes. The crusades were just bloody meaningless wars.

From now on, everytime you make a baseless assumption I'm just going to ask you to prove it. So, prove it.

&gt;True that, but killing people because of their religion was not common practice in Rome, but rather some anger or madness of some Emperor.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Roman_Empire

&gt;Read about the Pantheon. They welcomed all religion, normally with some exceptions. 

&gt;Killing people with no reason(I mean at least Nero killed the Christians with some explanation-he said the set Rome on fire) was done on a daily basis in the Middle Ages.


Prove it.


&gt;That plague happened after the Western Roman Empire's fall, thus in the Middle ages.

It doesn't matter whether it happened in the Middle Ages or not. The plague ravaged the Roman Empire to the point of killing 40% of Constantinople's population and Constantinople was by all accounts as roman as you could possibly get. 

&gt;And even if it were in the Roman Empire you can't possibly compare it to the later plague that killed something among the lines of 70% of Europe's population.

There was no later plague, the plague of Justinian was the black death itself. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian


&gt;Stop quoting /r/AskHistorians as a 100% sure source. I could write something there.

Like what? 

&gt;Besides as already mentioned Romans had aqueducts and baths of all kinds and all that stuff which was ditched after Rome's fall. The filth can't be compared.

So did Constantinople and yet it fell prey to the black death.

Maybe the problem is that people don't get scandalized when a mayor says such words. You are in a democratic country furthermore you're in an European country how could you justify fascism? Is something that I cannot understand, doesn't matter if was a mayor nobody or the president. It cannot be allowed.

You say that we do have a good democracy, I'm not an expert but they seems to have another opinion (Óscar Alzaga, Fermín Bouza...) and don't forget chieftaincy in Galicia... Don't be confused, this is not a good democracy and they are not good politicians. Anyway I don't think democracy is the panacea, something more close to the citizens and their problems will be better but until we find out democracy is our best alternative.

While they could steal without any kind of repercussion and make laws in their own benefit we will be more close to third world rather than an European state. And yes I blame PP and PSOE to orchestrate this since they don't allow new parties to reach them. 

I agree that one of the problems is matter of education, people will not address their obligations as citizens. Most people don't really know how they are voting or what really are they doing when they vote.

I'm a whiner I don't like this country neither their politicians. Sure it could be much better.

The ""90 days of visa-free presence"" is the clincher.  Since an aufenthaltstitel is legally a German visa, your visa-free period should commence the day your aufenthaltstitel expires.

You've spent the last three posts being scandalised, so you kind of defeat your own point there. You realise that a country that does not allow those who view fascism as the ideal political ideology to express their beliefs is less democratic, not more democratic, for doing so? Neither Alzaga nor Bouza are political scientists and seem to be confusing, as you do, the idea of ""good democracy"" with the idea of ""democracy I like"". You don't think democracy is a panacea? Yet again, I hear you repeat, almost verbatim, the catchphrases of the ""disenchanted spanish left-wing youth"" who have so much to say and yet accomplish so little. Of course democracy is not a panacea. Who told you it would be? Did you ever believe it was? Democracy is an imperfect means of power allocation that just happens to create more legitimacy, consensus and greater opportunity for the protection of individual rights and opinions than any alternative system invented to date. There is nothing closer to the citizens and their problems, and there will not be. Citizens need to become more adept at democracy, not vice versa. We have a good democracy and a pathetic electorate. The result is a large number of the issues you (with good intentions, but poor understanding of causality) complain about. Politicians don't ""steal and get away with it"". I've been in countries where this happens, and guess what? There is no Caso Barcenas or the like because the point is that they are never found out and processed. As for making laws in their favour...the politicians that do this do it because the electorate allows them to without punishing them by denying their vote to anyone who engages in this kind of behaviour. Again the problem is with the electorate, not politicians. They don't allow new parties to reach them? Come on, now. If half the country didn't insist on blindly voting for the same party on an almost hereditary basis, or allow themselves to vote based on civil war sympathies handed down, and a new, better party emerged and thus received the votes it deserved, PP and PSOE would not be able to do a single thing about it, and you know it. It is encouraging that you admit this next point, as it is the key feature that I am trying to impress upon you: the spanish people neglect their obligations as citizens, and are uninformed as to who to vote for and why to vote. This, not politicians in general or fascists or the imf or the capitalist class, is why the country is in disarray. The power lies with the people, and the people let it lie there untouched. What happens as a result can only be their own fault.
Don't be a whiner. Far too many Spaniards are, and it just perpetuates the problem. Be a doer. Be a man or woman of action. Vote and campaign for politicians who are worthwhile.

It works something like this:

Hm, who should I trust...you or Wikipedia. 

&gt;What led you to believe the collapse of the empire led to widespread famines and loss of wealth? Life changed very little for the people of western europe. The wealth of Rome was always in the hands of a priviledged few.

Yeah and those few were the Romans who, together with Greeks, shaped European civilization.

&gt;And before they were toys in the hands of the richmen of Rome. What's your point?

Actually, no. A rich Roman citizen and a porr Roman citizen had the same rights.

&gt;Do you have any sources to corroborate these claims?

No, but it's a logical conclusion. 

&gt;From now on, everytime you make a baseless assumption I'm just going to ask you to prove it. So, prove it.

Well, British tribes had the tradition of putting decapitated heads on their walls and let the rot, spreading disease. [What have the Romans ever done for us?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExWfh6sGyso). That should clear why Rome brought civilization, higene and technology to barbarians. On the other hand, the Crusades brought nothing positive to anyone. Just death and suffering.

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Roman_Empire

As I said-these were not done by Roman law, but just by a few mad emperors and were quite the rare thing.

&gt;Prove it.

What am I supposed to prove? What don't you understand? Is it not true that throughout the Middle Ages people were accused of witchcraft and killed with no apparent reason. And is it not true that after conquering each tribe the Romans would put the local Gods in the Pantheon and respect them together with Roman Gods?

&gt;It doesn't matter whether it happened in the Middle Ages or not. The plague ravaged the Roman Empire to the point of killing 40% of Constantinople's population and Constantinople was by all accounts as roman as you could possibly get.

It most certainly does. The Byzantine was no longer Rome, they even spoke a different language. Another proof that after the fall of Rome filth and plague started ravaging the land, because this was after the fall of Rome.

&gt;There was no later plague, the plague of Justinian was the black death itself.

If I had not written so much already before reading this I'd just end the discussion. Are you trolling me? No later plague? The bigger plague took place in about 1340-50. That's when Bocaccio's Decameron takes place. He lived in the 1300's. Here [the later plague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death) is.

&gt;So did Constantinople and yet it fell prey to the black death.

It was not the black plague and it wasn't nearly as devastating.

That makes the FYROM story even more hilarious. I've seen an argument in this thread that they're just studying the history of their region, except during the period they chose to study their region wasn't even inside Macedonia. And it makes you wonder, why didn't they chose the Dardani? Why did they single out the Macedonians (who where also outside the FYROM region no less) from the the other Ancient Greeks, contrary to the way the Macedonians identified, and to how historically talking about seperate greek poleis and states stopped being a thing roughly during the Roman conquest.

Cause they are trying to distort history to forge their national identity.

Wenn also, wie schon anderswo hier im Thread erwähnt, bei einem Interview ein hashtag eingeblendet wird, kann man so besonders einfach darüber diskutieren.

It approaches to a philosophical question. From my point of view no. A country that prevents fascism (or other kind of totalitarianism) to reach the government is more democratic that the one that allows their politicians advocate them or be proud of them.

There is a huge line between 'I don't like your political ideas so your party becomes illegal' and 'you are trying to create a new totalitarianism with your party so I prevent you to reach the government'.


&gt; Neither Alzaga nor Bouza are political scientists and seem to be confusing, as you do, the idea of ""good democracy"".

No, maybe Alzaga is not a political scientists but in UCD he worked in the current electoral system. I could remember where I read that he is against it.


&gt; and labelling them fascists

I didn't put any label of fascism to the people who has another political view different from mine. If you understood this I think I should improve much more my English. 

I put the label of fascist to this group who irrupted and hit the people and the mayor of Beade and Baralla for advocate it.


&gt; There is nothing closer to the citizens and their problems, and there will not be.

It's brave to say there will not be anything more close to citizens as democracy. I think is a merely question of time that someone find out another way. It took more than 2 millions years until some Greeks started to think about it or the French if you prefer it. 

&gt; Politicians don't ""steal and get away with it"". I've been in countries where this happens, and guess what? There is no Caso Barcenas or the like because the point is that they are never found out and processed

Open your eyes. None of them will be punished, we've a lot of similar cases. A few months in the first pages of the diaries and then people will be distracted with another thing.


Regardless who I vote, whatever I do or not to change it I will be always a whiner, I don't like this country neither their politicians.

Nachzulesen in Jürgen Grässlins Buch ""Schwarzbuch Waffenhandel"". Dort heisst es im Abschnitt:

""Heiße Geschäfte mit gekühlten Gewehren?""

...
Das G36-Projekt Saudi-Arabien schien in Gefahr, Abermillionen an Einnahmen könnten Heckler &amp; Koch entgehen. Die Lösung des Problems dagegen war ebenso einfach wie genial.
Die Präzisionsbeschusswaffe wurde unter Wüstenbeschuss ausgetauscht. Eine kalte Waffe sei aus dem airgekühlten Auto herausgeholt worden. 
Dabei waren jederzeit gleich mehrere Soldaten der Royal Saudi Army vor Ort, die jede Handbewegung des Heckler &amp; Koch-Waffenteams mit Argusaugen beobachteten. Genau deshalb galt es einen Moment abzuwarten, der den Austausch der Waffen ermöglichen sollte.
Man habe sich kurzerhand die religiösen Gewohnheiten der Muslime zunutze gemacht, so der Insider. Das Gebet erfolgte gegen 18.00 Uhr. In dieser Zeit wurde die Waffe ausgetauscht gegen eine aus dem klimatisierten Auto. Als die Militärs aus der Gebetspause zurückkamen, war offenbar alles geregelt. Die Saudis dachten, das sei eine heiße Waffe, denn die Waffen waren den ganzen Tag der Wüste ausgesetzt. Kein Wunder also, dass dieser Belastungstest dann ein Präzisionstest war. Im Laufe der Beschussversuche machte sich Zufriedenheit breit, denn durch diesen Trick wurden tolle Testergebnisse erzielt.

It's rather unfortunate, and I'm trying to get over it to enjoy the remaining two months I have here, as I've never been to Europe at all so I feel that I should get out and do something since my rental car and gas are paid for by my company.

As for straw man, I hope you understand that this is not an insult but a description of a debate technique seeking to misdirect the discussion: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man
Is my labelling incorrect? In my experience those who are described by most as disenchanted spanish left-wing youth are little more than whiners, pedants and parrots of their forefathers ideals and positions (which applies equally to most spaniards regardless of age or political affiliation, to be fair). I'd consider myself a better example of what it really means to be disenchanted, left-wing and Spanish than any of the opportunists who just want to throw a few rocks at police and blame Botin for their inability to finish their degree or the fact that they have given up trying to find employment. Do you not understand that if, in a democracy, the majority chooses to support a party which aims to reinstate totalitarianism, then to do anything other than that is undemocratic? I agree that it is an issue that requires a philosophical perspective, but this does not mean that there is more than one correct answer. Democracy is not a fairground ride. You can't hop on it when it is of convenience to you, when your party is in power, when your candidate wins an election. As long as fascist parties stay within the limits of the constitution and the law, and limit the power they wield to that  which they have gained democratically, then to prohibit him is to be no better, or even worse, than them. Si no entiendes esto, que la democracia es un sistema y no una herramienta que en las buenas si y en las malas pues porque lo digo yo ya no, apaga y vamonos. El que prohibe, por muy nobles que sean sus intenciones y por muy despreciable que sea lo que busca prohibir, no es mas que un fascista de izquierdas, aunque no lo sepa o crea lo contrario. It's very easy to be young in Spain right now, in some ways. Sure, there are no jobs, there is no hope...but there is an absolute bounty of excuses. The economy is keeping me jobless. The politicians are ruining my country and I can't do anything. The justice system is a failure. This is a third world country. Franco is still pulling the strings from beyond the grave. None of these things are true, but unfortunately some of Spain's youth thinks they are convincing enough to hide behind. Yes, preceding generations fucked up, yes, most politicians are a fucking disgrace, no, this is no excuse. We are the future of Spain, and if we rest on the prickly laurels that retroactive blame provides, that future is bleak. Instead of moaning when these thugs are given due process of law, we should celebrate. Instead of assuming Barcenas and co. will get away free of charge, we should have faith in our institutions.

How about historians. You do trust historians don't you? 

&gt;Yeah and those few were the Romans who, together with Greeks, shaped European civilization.

You keep changing the subject every single time I counter your argument. First you claimed that during the Roman Empire everyone was wealthy and then you go on about... well frankly I don't know what you're going on about right now. Your style of argumentation is quite schizophrenic. 

&gt;Actually, no. A rich Roman citizen and a porr Roman citizen had the same rights.

Prove it. 

&gt;No, but it's a logical conclusion. 

This has nothing to do with ""logical conclusions"". You made sweeping claims about an entire era of history. Either back them up or admit you're wrong.

&gt;Well, British tribes had the tradition of putting decapitated heads on their walls and let the rot, spreading disease. 

Prove it.

&gt;What have the Romans ever done for us?.

The Pythons were comedians, not historians. 

&gt;That should clear why Rome brought civilization, higene and technology to barbarians. 

What barbarians? 

&gt;On the other hand, the Crusades brought nothing positive to anyone. Just death and suffering.

Would you enjoy having your nation conquered and a foreign culture imposed on you?

&gt;As I said-these were not done by Roman law, but just by a few mad emperors and were quite the rare thing.

What does Roman law have to do with the persecution of Christians?

&gt;What am I supposed to prove? What don't you understand? Is it not true that throughout the Middle Ages people were accused of witchcraft and killed with no apparent reason. 

What event are you refering to? 

&gt;And is it not true that after conquering each tribe the Romans would put the local Gods in the Pantheon and respect them together with Roman Gods?

No.

&gt;It most certainly does. The Byzantine was no longer Rome, they even spoke a different language.

Justinian's native language was Latin, as was his wife's. The lingua franca might have been greek but then again the same was true for the Western Empire at least when it came to matters of civilised discourse. Calling the Eastern Roman Empire ""Byzantium"" is a modern distinction based on the changes in administration brought on during the 7th century following the catastrophic loss of territory to the muslim invaders. 

&gt;Another proof that after the fall of Rome filth and plague started ravaging the land, because this was after the fall of Rome.

The Eastern Roman Empire practiced the same standards of hygiene as the Western Roman Empire. If the plague had hit two hundred years earlier it would have had the same effect. 

&gt;If I had not written so much already before reading this I'd just end the discussion. Are you trolling me? No later plague? The bigger plague took place in about 1340-50. 

The Plague of Justinian is the first incident of the Black Death occuring in Europe. After it subsided it sporadically reappeared to devastating effect up to and including the major outbreak that killed 45% of Europe's population. There was no other plague.

Well, is your experience. 

&gt; As long as fascist parties stay within the limits of the constitution and the law, and limit the power they wield to that  which they have gained democratically, then to prohibit him is to be no better, or even worse, than them.

Hitler was voted democratically, his party was within the limits of their laws then 6 million of Jews were killed. My point is: if preventing the creation of totalitarianism or fascist parties (whatever the side they choose left or right) I could avoid a new holocaust yes, I will illegalize them. 

&gt; Si no entiendes esto, que la democracia es un sistema y no una herramienta que en las buenas si y en las malas pues porque lo digo yo ya no, apaga y vamonos. No eres mas que un fascista de izquierdas, aunque no lo sepas o creas lo contrario. 

I understand it furthermore this is why I said that democracy is not the panacea. I don't know if our laws are strong enough to prevent a new Hitler.

Could you understand that questioning, thinking and trying to find a new system better than democracy is good for us? Sounds like a chimera but 90 years ago we though that the Sun was at the center of the universe, until Hubble.

However, some features are deactivated (you can’t do your own software updates, KD does them for you, remotely) and KD basically has remote access to push updates and diagnose problems (however that’s something that is also getting widespread with DSL routers, I think).

Since you are sitting much close to their hardware they do not want you to disrupt their network with your own hardware. That’s why they need their own device they control in your home. But the router you get is definitely not a bad one, you can use it like a dumb modem if you want to and you get all the usual options (KD does not tell you how to configure your WiFi).

It's perfectly reasonable.

Citizens of many EU countries can visit various countries all over the world without visas, while citizens of those same countries can visit few or no EU countries without visas. And the converse situation is not limited to the USA and Canada; in fact it's probably the case more often than not as you spin the globe.

This is how these things work.

Visa policy is driven by a combination of pragmatic issues — incentivizing tourism, easing business relationships, avoiding abuse and overstays — and emotional, impractical ones — punishing political or tribal rivalries, ""retaliating"" against contralateral visa requirements, etc.

A sensible country seeks to allow as many people as practical to enter visa-free, because it means more tourism and more trade, excluding only those nationalities that have proven to disproportionately cause problems.

Only people acting as children would say ""you make us get visas, therefore we will make you get them too."" Fortunately that mindset is in the minority among policymakers worldwide.",0,1379220420,null,0,false,0,cc8l4of,t3_1mdb6u,t1_cc8l4of,t1_cc89elm,null,1429459520,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"I don't mean the USSR example to be like Catalonia. I really didn't mean to liken the two, but looks like two people already thought that's what I meant, so I guess my wording was misleading. I was just rambling off topic with the USSR bit. Catalonia is a popular movement, yes. I don't doubt that (although I read that only a slim majority wants actual independence, IIRC). I have a friend from Spain, he's told me enough about you guys, heh. He doesn't actually care that much for a Spaniard, but that's not the point really. Separatist movements in developed countries inherently misguided IMO. They all think it will be a glorious change. It won't. Things will still be the same. Spain is a bit of a special case, it went through very rough economic times followed by the hated austerity measures (that weren't close to being enough anyway). Catalonia feels like they're stuck with Spanish mistakes, yeah. But I'm not sure that creating a separate country will solve these problems. 

I subscribe to the *Economist* and read my news daily on BBC. I'm not reading some crackpot blogs and I'm not just sitting on reddit. I read a lot and believe me, I read about your situation too. Yes, it hurts when you are paying more in taxes than you receive. But I also read that you're going to be out of the EU for more than just a year likely as such things aren't done swiftly. I don't know what customs agreements Spain will sign either. In either case, it's not going to look good for trade. I read about the debt in Catalonia - it's considerable and starting off an independent polity with such debt won't be pretty. I read about the estimates of starting a new infrastructure that will replace the Spanish one - that will account for at least half the savings in taxes sent to Madrid according to the *Economist*. Economic situation won't be lovely really. Any interruption of the normal routine and the markets suffer a great deal. If the practical basis of the independence movement is rooted in pragmatism then there isn't much basis. Sounds like a lot of people in Catalonia are understandably frustrated with the Spanish economic woes but from what I heard during the Spanish boom years the independence movement wasn't quite as popular...
