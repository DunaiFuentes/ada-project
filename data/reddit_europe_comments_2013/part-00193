true,BoilerButtSlut,UNSA,Amerikai Egyesült Államok,"I probably worded that terribly, but I stand by my premise. Let me start by asking you this: How many people in 1935 would say that Britain wouldn't be a superpower 25 years later? My guess is: Almost none. You could say the same for the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1985. Superpowers and their political structures are fluid. They come and go. 

Here's why I think the same of Russia:

1. Population. That's just it, it doesn't have a huge population. It barely has more people than Japan. Bangladesh has more. This is presumably why Putin is pulling out the stops to get countries into his Eurasian Union. A superpower needs a large common market and labor pool, and Russia has a decent size, but not enough compared to the future big players such as the EU, or even the US.

2. The Russian economy is heavily dependent on oil (45% of the Russian economy is oil-related, to be exact). That level of non-diversity is not healthy for a superpower economy (though admittedly it's working great for them right now). There is not enough specialization. The rest of the economy and political system around it is heavily corrupt and there's no real will to change it.

3. Their military isn't really that great. They aren't a threat to anyone except their former republics. This doesn't really matter anyway since force is a discredited form of diplomacy amongst other superpowers. Economic ""soft power"" is where you have real influence.

4. When you combine the previous three, you begin to realize that decades from now, if there is a hypothetical diplomatic problem and economic soft power comes into play between China and Russia, or the EU and Russia, Russia is going to lose.

Russia will remain a big REGIONAL power, but a big international power? No, other than what their UN veto can give.

China, South America, the EU, etc. There are the real powers in the future. The US isn't immune either, BTW. The US just had the fortunate benefit of not having communism for 70+ years, nor two destructive wars take place on its territory. It does, however, have a retarded and expensive foreign policy that could leave it diplomatically isolated or less influential.

Edit: I should also mention that this is nothing at all against Russia or Russians, nor is this meant to be insulting (though admittedly I wrote the original post rather inflammatory), it's just pointing out that the influence of the soviet years are gone, and the people running the country need to realize this and move on.

I dont know if you are Swedish, but BÖR is a qualifier word. And why use a qualifier word? Because there is still an individual judgment upon every person who arrives in Sweden.

Do you speak Swedish? Because in the videos you are linking, they are saying that the ""PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED, HAVE THE RIGHT TO STAY PERMANENTLY, ALSO BRINGING THEIR FAMILIES FOR UNIFICATION"". 

None of the articles you link, claims that any one who gets here, are free to stay permanently, but any new arrivals will still have to be judged on a person to person basis to see if they qualify (first as the term refugee), but also by Utlänningslagen Kap 4 Par. 1.:

I sold my car this summer and came to Spain on a year long student visa. I registered for a program at the city university here to get my student visa and the switched to a program for less time and one that was cheaper. 

Teaching English is definitely your best bet. When I came to this city I just put up advertisements on a few websites and now have more work then I can handle.

I also got a job teaching at an academy and have already been offered a summer position and possible sponsorship for a work visa next year.

2. Shale gas is not present in sufficient quantities to make a big difference to European energy. It is likely to be more expensive (estimated at twice the cost) of US extraction, so won't push out Russian gas or coal. Here's a good paper on the market aspects, but from what little I've read elsewhere, it seems optimistic on the safety front.

That's how Europe could cut their marionette strings of Russian control and bring stability to the markets.  Tell the UK to drop European renewable targets if they want, give them a pass, and let the UK come charging out of the stall.

The UK has a projected 1.3 QUADrillion cubic feet in the Bowland Basin.  It's so huge that even if they can extract a tenth, you're still in the hundreds of trillions.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23069499

I'll put this into some context.  

If the UK has a conservative estimate around 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas between Yorkshire and Lancashire running down to around Nottingham, then in all 50 states the US has 1,161 trillion cubic feet.  We shouldn't even be discussing this at this point, we should be well into pretending to be Scrooge McDuck swimming around in all our gold.  The *North* is asset rich!

We can listen to what has happened in the US which uses a different system and which has different regulations and what has been dramatised in movies like Gasland, or we could listen to our own Green domestic voices that seem to believe a working energy policy involves becoming two thirds Amish, or we could listen to the Gazprom End of Shale-Times apocrypha...

...or we could listen the British Geological Society and read their reports which say it can be extracted safely if a little due care is put in place.  Let's not pretend that because there are two vocal sides that they're equally balanced when it comes to marbles and trustworthiness.

Presumiamo per un attimo che gli autori abbiano voluto usare il marchio McDonald's solo per amore d'istruzione: questa è una pratica scorretta dato che avvantaggia un marchio rispetto a un altro, e per questo nei libri di testo o diretti al pubblico si fanno sempre riferimenti neutri: ad esempio l'azienda X compra 10 azioni dell'azienda Y e casi simili.

Poi non ho idea sinceramente di come scrivere McDonald's su un libro di testo catturi l'attenzione a favore dell'apprendimento, anche perché se leggi bene, il testo non è incentrato sull'alimentazione, ma parte proprio dicendo *non è vero che il fast food fa poi così male*. Insomma, capirai che non ci sono fini prettamente didattici dietro questa pagina.

Quel logo sta là perché l'azienda ha pagato bei soldi per farcelo stare, perché garantisce visibilità al marchio a una fascia ben precisa (ragazzi dagli 11 ai 13 anni), e con una frequenza spropositata: *almeno* centinaia, se non migliaia, di ragazzi avranno quel libro, che sfoglieranno *almeno* altre centinaia di volte all'anno. Una frequenza così alta con un target così preciso vale oro per le aziende, che sono disposte a pagare spazi pubblicitari con caratteristiche di gran lunga meno preferibili di un libro di testo.

Inoltre, perché è sbagliato esporre ragazzini a una pubblicità nei libri di scuola? Innanzitutto perché già vengono inondati abbastanza ovunque, poi perché un ragazzino, ma anche un teenager (anche se meno), è solitamente ancora profondamente influenzabile, e più tenera è l'età alla quale fidelizzi il cliente, più soldi riuscirai a ottenere da questo. *Per questo* fanno le festicciole agli asili, altro che distribuzione a titolo gratuito.

Common Law provides some legal tools that made Cyprus a favourable tax destination, namely the concept of [trusts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law).

* Government Spokesperson announced that privatisations, as per IMF obligation, will begin soon.

(Comment: I am not flat-out opposed to privatisations, but I think that there are a few things that can't survive in the free market and need to be collectively owned and non-profit oriented to be the best they can be. Among them is the power and telco *network infrastructure*, but not necessarily the commercial services they offer. After all, if Cyta didn't *have* to offer ADSL in my area because they are semi-state run, they probably wouldn't, just like private telcos do not offer their service in my area).

 * Cyprus Broadcasting Corporations sees yearly budget reduced to 20 million euros and a complete ban on airing advertisments, takes two idiotic steps to meet new budget: a) bans access to Twitter for all stuff, *including journalists* [[CM]](http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/09/08/facebook-freeze-stuns-cybc-journalists/), and b) axes non-Greek programming, including programming in the second official language of the country, Turkish, and the English Service [[CM]](http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/09/08/foreign-language-services-poised-for-cuts/) (Comment: There's lot of waste in CyBC, but those steps are terrible decisions, or rather, a smokescreen to divert attention for actual unnecessary spending.

This time, a law to require that men exempt from obligatory **24**-month military service service will have to be re-evaluated if they are to be employed by the public sector, and if the new evaluation describes them as suitable they will have to go back and serve in the army, essentially being disqualified for the job position they rightfully won.

In the past there were tight restrictions which included publicly releasing the reason a man was exempt from serving, having served in the army was a requirement to get a driver's license, and of course there was and  still is a very harsh rhetoric against serving in the army, a rhetoric that does not accept anti-militarism and conscientious objection, instead labelling those people indiscriminately as “lazy” and “Abusers of the system”. Conscientious objectors do not have a civil service alternative. They have to serve in the army camps, wearing uniforms but not having guns, and they have to serve approximately 33% longer, an arrangement that clearly punishes anti-militaristic conscience. Earlier this year a dissertation on punishing anti-militarism in the Republic of Cyprus was published and you can read it on [[ISSUU]](http://issuu.com/conscientiousobjectioncyprus/docs/conscientiousobjection-cyprus). I should also note that Cyprus Army (aka the National Guard) is prone to peace-time accidents which include helicopters falling, trucks not having working brakes, stay bullets from exercises reaching civilian residences, and recently, ammunition exploding so hard it halved the country's GDP for that year. Not a place you'd want to be, neither an organisation that you'd like to have near you) 

* Author of queer-theamed books Mários Fríxou, employed as a guard in Cyprus Central Prison won a legal battle against the disciplinary council of the prison that one and a half year ago punished him for appearing in three televised discussions on the subjects of poverty/unemployment and of homosexuality, “without the permission of the employer”, a permission that he didn't need because he was neither representing nor even talking about his employer.

* Women who were forced to prostitute themselves (they were locked up in flats and forced to have sex with customers) arrested for transmitting STDs. Having sex without a condom is charged extra and requested by the male costumers, but the men refuse to take responsibility for not using protections, instead requiring sympathy for themselves and blaming the sex workers (not regulated as it is illegal in Cyprus, and in that specific case, it was as already mentioned *forced*) [[Ph]](http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/top-stories/885/161912/ekdidontan-me-molysmatikes-astheneies)  

* Imam Shakir Alemdar, representing the Mufti's Office, constitutionally a representative of the Cypriot Muslim community feels like his community is ignored by the new conservative government that refused to even talk to him, despite his constitutional role and his allegiance to the Republic of Cyprus, not to the breakaway TRNC. (Context&amp;Trivia: The Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus, drafted by Britain but signed by the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders of that time is a weird one, and obviously a non-functioning one. It called for an unitary state and acknowledges two peoples: Greek Christians and Muslim Turks and so was the legal and government structure formed. People of other ethnicities and other religions were forced to be *classified* either as Greek or Turk. The Archbishop and the Grand Mufti are supposed to have equal “ethnarch” roles to their respective communities. The political division since 1963 and the de facto partition of 1974 left the constitution even weirder, which positions of the government not filled because they are allocated for Turkish Cypriots, and with constitutional provisions not applied to Turkish Cypriots  living in the areas controlled by the Republic of Cyprus because tl;dr the constitution is partly suspended and RoC is in a State of Need).

* All the candidates for the local elections this November have been certified. It looks like there is a chance of some pretty big movements, hopefully to the better (if we don;t have again a EU supported 40% election fraud election).

* We now have the first recorded cases of deforming malnutrition in Kosovo. Shit's getting worse for everyone except the very top.
* Our pension fund is ""managed"" by an Irish company. Turns out that our pension fund imploded during the last few years due to the crisis. This again happened because the EU pushed for a law in Kosovo strictly forbidding reinvestment of the pension fund and the privatization fund back into Kosovo businesses.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Electric heating is kind-a inefficient though.

Yes and no. Because the alternative most people will think about is central heating with a gaz powered heater in your house/flat. This heater has a terrible efficiency compared to massive industrial-grade powerplants. Even adding the converting loss it's a lot more efficient. Losses due to the last power/heat conversion at home are also negligible because lost power frequently becomes... heat too. Therefore useful.

Therefore if you get heat from a nuclear powerplant; it's a lot more clean and faster to heat homes than using insanes amounts of gaz in home heaters. If you need extra power on short notice (like you do in a winter cold time), just take that gaz and feed it to a powerplant and send it along the same way. You also need no extra infrastructure; which kindah reduce furthermore the entire ""green bill"" (building gaz pipes and such requires tons of energy too ! to bring in pipes truck; manufacture pipes; etc etc).",0,1379247087,null,0,false,0,cc8p6q8,t3_1mf971,t1_cc8p6q8,t1_cc8obiv,null,1429457615,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

People are used to it, it has become normal. This is weird, I'm well-travelled and have not encountered this in any other European country. 
2. I have personally witnessed hundreds, upon hundreds of dudes flagrantly pissing all over the seat and the stall in bars, clubs and restaurants (not so much in posh restaurants), without a care in the world. Bizarrely, this is also the case in the ladies bogs. In fact they can be worse. 
3. The state of the toilet is a given... In any group of girls all of them will have 'just in case' tissues, if they've run out, their friend will obviously have spare. Please note, this isn't, of course, tissue to wipe the seat with, but just because French toilets are generally disgusting, and often without bog roll. 
4. I've seen many pissy, shitty toilets in airports, hospitals and other municipal-type buildings, none of them with seats. I've come to understand that it's a national thing. 

I realise that this isn't an answer to your question, but I kind of jumped on it, since it's become normal for me too... But it still seems such horrible, unpleasant a normality. Everyone I know has a toilet seat in their home set-up, so why is it that when you step out of your home you are faced with such slovenly toiletiquette and upkeep? Just bizarre, and unlike (generally speaking) any of the surrounding countries. I wish I knew the answer. It seems too culturally ingrained for it to be simply that all bar owners have collectively decided that loo seats are not a good idea. 

For the record, it just makes me roll my eyes and think of them as daft, unhygienic, selfish and immature. I love most other things about this country. If I'm pissing, I'll lift the seat if there is one (with my shoe if it's a mess, or if I need a shit, I'll just wipe it down, take a seat and clip one off. It's just a bit of piss after all... Be better if it wasn't there though, but life's too short.

*Domestic:*

* The government has yet again had to abandon one of its election promises. This time it was an increase period of earmarked maternity leave for fathers. This has led to some bitterness between the leftwing liberal party and social democrats. Another bad story about abandoned election promises for the current government and it only cements the fact that they will properly be thrown out in the next election. Right now they are trailing behind in the polls 43% to the oppositions 57% (BERLINGSKE BAROMETER, 9th September).
 
* In other political news, it has never been better for the Danish People Party. One year ago Pia Kjærsgaard stepped down, and her successor, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, has led the party from 13% to 18% in the polls and the party now has more than 12.000 members. The party also stands a real chance to gain some mayoral positions in the municipal elections in two months.

*Syria:*

* Danish Politicians seem relieved with the new Russian proposal of Syria giving its chemical weapons up voluntarily. First the government supported a solution through the UN, then we didn’t need a security council mandate. And then, after the British seemed to have reservations the Danish Politicians didn’t know what to do, so the new proposal is a good way out for the moment.

* At least 65 Danish citizens have gone to Syria to fight in the civil war. They are a varied bunch of both devout Muslims, former gang leaders and from certain ethnic groups. At least six have been killed so far. But what has the Danish Security and Intelligence Service worried, is that they will come back battle-hardened and perhaps radicalized.

Ffs- stop making stuff up.  One has computers to keep up with the world, not to get more vacation and Greeks public servants have one of the lowest productivity in the OECD. So, your theory doesn't hold. So, neither have they increased their productivity since they are significantly lower, nor is the reason to get a computer that they should get more vacation.  You are just making stuff up that has no base in reality.  


And the context that the law was written was idiotic from the beginning.  The reason one needed breaks are for eyes and health, as in tense shoulders. One doesn't cure that with an extra week of vacation.  




In addition, do you think the Greeks state can afford to have more vacation than the Finns for example? Why? In particular when the Finns give them money? How are the Greeks states finances so good that they can afford this? 

And, you conveniently forget that this does increase the productivity.  Lower cost plus more work does that.  It is simple math.  

And I do not see what private companies has to do with it. You keep straying from the subject.  Do you think the Greeks should get an extra week vacation (in comparison to everyone else). Answer this now, or are you to much of a coward- you refuse to. Yes or no!   Why should they get it if yes? Why is it harder for Greeks to work in front of a computer than for Estonians?

Nel sistema presidenziale si sa a chi attribuire la colpe per le cose non fatte o fatte male, nel nostro sistema il cittadino-elettore medio fa fatica a capire chi ha vinto, di chi è la colpa se il governo non ha agito come doveva. Ricordati comunque che condizione necessaria per un buon sistema presidenziale (o semi-presidenziale) è un sistema di pesi e contrappesi che possano, nel caso, bloccare particolari azioni del Presidente. In ogni caso, questa riforma deve essere concordata con la riforma della legge elettorale: presidenzialismo/semi-presidenzialismo = sistema maggioritario (per non frammentare troppo il parlamento, cosa che darebbe ulteriori poteri al presidente).

&gt; Innanzitutto penso che una riforma elettorale debba poter far scegliere i singoli candidati direttamente agli elettori

Lo sai che nel 1991 è passato un referendum per l'abrogazione delle preferenze? Con un sistema maggioritario a collegi uninominali comunque non servirebbe. Gli elettori del collegio voterebbero comunque per il loro candidato preferito che verrebbe mandato in parlamento (al di là delle appartenenze politiche), in questo modo si crea un legame con il territorio.

Lots of news this week about the Diada and the referendum on independence. In chronological order:

* It is made public that president Artur Mas and Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy met on 29th August to talk about the Catalan issue.
* Artur Mas talks about the possibility of postponing the referendum on independence to 2016 and asking more than one question.
* Hundreds of thousands form a secessionist human chain 400 km long on Catalan national day.
* Mas regrets and says the referendum will be in 2014. The exact date and question will be decided in two months.
* Latvian and Lithuanian PM's openly talk about recognizing an independent Catalonia if it's a legitimate and legal process.
* Spanish goverment wants to cool down Catalan demands by consenting to talk about finantial issues.
* PM Mariano Rajoy responds to a letter by Mas sended 2 months ago in which Catalan president demanded the referendum. Rajoy says 'no' without saying 'no'.

Other reactions to the Diada in Spain:

* The socialist party (main party in the opposition) says a federal system would solve the problem but does not support the referendum.
* Fascists attack a Catalan government act in Madrid. They've been arrested.

Other news:

* Madrid will not bid for the next Olympic Games after three defeats in a row.

Errrrh what. A local home heater is efficient to about 40%. That is 40% of the generated heat is usable in your home. Discounting the enormous costs to manufacture said gaz heater, install it everywhere etc which is a lot more complicated than just electric convectors (basically resistors with a bunch of metal around). Then as for the power plants most of europe is running on nuclear reactors so it takes about a grand total of no gas to run. I think the ecological bilan is quite clear about which power source is cleaner.

&gt; Also, I can imagine a system that stores heat in summer to use it in winter.

Thermodynamics does run that way. We can barely isolate over a few days (try cutting power to your fridge to see how long it lasts). Over months ? Ah, lolz.

It's like bloody stockholm syndrome, we know that stray dogs are roaming the street, they are trouble, yet instead of dealing with the problem we defend it.

&gt;animal rights groups like Four Paws are instead calling for a mass sterilization program. This, they argue, would stop the animals from breeding and **enable them to live out their lives on the street**.

Wut? That's the bloody problem in the first place. Just because they can't have pups doesn't mean they won't bite. Idiots. It would also mean you have to keep up with the dogs constantly because you have to know when a new one arrives that hasn't been sterilised yet and even if somehow magically every dog could be sterilised, it would take at least 10 years for all of them to die naturally. That's way too long a time for them to roam the streets and chase after people.

In realtà, il mio commento voleva sollevare il dilemma di come un autore di libri di testo (non universitari) possa attirare l'attenzione di uno scolaro tra gli 11 e 13 anni. La domanda è: siamo sicuri che gli autori del libro siano in malafede?

Tu dici che gli autori dovrebbero fare sempre riferimenti neutri. Secondo me questa astrazione può risultare controproducente perché non attira l'attenzione dell'allievo. Un esempio concreto è concreto solo quando gli allievi lo posso mettere in relazione alle loro esperienze e per ragazzini di 12 anni ""l'azienda X"" e ""l'azienda Y"" non gli rappresentano niente. 

Detto questo,
&gt;questa è una pratica scorretta dato che avvantaggia un marchio rispetto a un altro

Come fai a sapere che nel libro non ci siano altri riferimenti ad altri marchi che controbilanciano il riferimento a McD? Il post che hai linkato ti fa vedere solo la foto di una pagina. Come fai a sapere che il libro non ha 10 pagine sul riso e altre 10 pagine sulla frutta?   

&gt;il testo non è incentrato sull'alimentazione

Mi dispiace contraddirti, ma circa tre quarti della pagina consiste di tabelle con valori nutrizionali. 

&gt;Quel logo sta là perché l'azienda ha pagato bei soldi per farcelo stare

Per quanto ne so io, gli autori possono anche aver dovuto pagare McDonald's, visto che hanno usato il loro marchio registrato. 

Insomma, se proprio vogliamo evitare di essere naif, il post (che non cita né il titolo né gli autori del libro) è pubblicato su un blog con un bel po' di ""articoli"" anti-McDonalds (vedi l'altro link su r/italy).

true,amicocinghiale,italy,,"&gt;Tu dici che gli autori dovrebbero fare sempre riferimenti neutri. Secondo me questa astrazione può risultare controproducente perché non attira l'attenzione dell'allievo.

Non capisco come scrivere il nome di un marchio possa aumentare l'attenzione dell'allievo. L'attenzione si aumenta esponendo gli argomenti in maniera chiara e facendo esempi chiari e concisi. Mettere un nome di certo non dà alcun apporto.

&gt;Come fai a sapere che nel libro non ci siano altri riferimenti ad altri marchi che controbilanciano il riferimento a McD? 
Come fai a sapere che ci sono? Ma poi, *anche* ci fossero, cosa di cui dubito fortemente, che vuol dire controbilanciare? Esistono decine di marchi di fast food, non è una cosa fattibile.

&gt;circa tre quarti della pagina consiste di tabelle con valori nutrizionali.
qua non capisco se mi stai trollando o fai sul serio. Sono valori nutrizionali *usati* per *pubblicizzare* i *prodotti* di una *azienda privata*, non per insegnare la quantità media giornaliera da assumere, informazione neutra e utile. Non è che, metto i valori nutrizionali delle bucce di banana e allora il testo parla di alimentazione. Ovviamente il testo parla di alimentazione, ma di *alimentazione di McDonald's*, non dell'alimentazione *di per sé*, oppure *sana*, oppure di un popolo. Se era un libro/saggio/paper/ricerca su McDonald's e l'alimentazione la pagina (costruita in altro modo, ovviamente il testo è scritto con chiari fini promozionali) non sarebbe stata fuori luogo. Mi pare non sia uno di questi casi però.

&gt;Per quanto ne so io, gli autori possono anche aver dovuto pagare McDonald's, visto che hanno usato il loro marchio registrato.

E allora ne sai male, non ha senso pagare per dare visibilità all'azienda, il libro certo non ne guadagna valore aggiunto, il Mc sì, per cui si dà il caso che sia chi ci guadagna a dover pagar per ottenere quel servizio.

&gt;il post (che non cita né il titolo né gli autori del libro) è pubblicato su un blog con un bel po' di ""articoli"" anti-McDonalds

Irrilevante, io neanche ho guardato l'orientamento del blog e neanche mi interessa, a me interessa la notizia di per sé che poteva essere anche pubblicata su Topolino. Ripeto, non sono un salutista e mi piace il cibo di McDonald's, quindi non parto certo prevenuto, ma in questo caso è davvero manifesta l'inappropiatezza di quello che è a tutti gli effetti una reclame.

Avant de le juger hâtivement (majorité des commentaires ici), on devrait au moins considérer : 

- la séquence des événements menant à cette issue tragique n'aurait même pu être concevable sans la commission réfléchie et préméditée d'un crime violent de la part de la ""victime"".

- l'acte a été fait sous l'emprise d'une décharge d'adrénaline et dans un stress extrême. La décision de la part des braqueurs de commettre cet acte illégal et de s'équiper en conséquence (avec la part de danger, de traumatisme infligé à la victime, de balles perdues, etc.) a en revanche été prise de sang froid.

- si l'issue avait différée et que c'est lui qui serait mort, on se serait tous couchés en se disant ""ha bah les braquages qui tournent mal, ça arrive hein"". D'ailleurs je suis sûr que ça aurait arrangé la justice, la police et une certaine presse/opinion publique que ça se passe ainsi. 

- il est permis de penser que ce n'est pas un acte ponctuel des braqueurs. Le braquage de commerces relativement sécurisés et souvent pris pour cible, ce n'est pas du vol à l'étalage. S'il s'agit effectivement de criminels de carrière, alors s'ils n'avaient pas arrêtés suite à ce braquage d'une manière ou d'une autre, ils auraient pu re-braquer. Et cette fois, avec une conséquence tragique sur une ou plusieurs victime(s) innocente(s).

- ainsi que démontré par l'affaire Goetz aux Etats-Unis dans les années 80, ce genre de faits divers où un justicier prend les choses en main en allant trop loin peut avoir directement ou indirectement un effet électrochoc sur l'opinion publique, la justice et les délinquants (càd à long terme faire baisser les taux de délinquance et de criminalité).

Est-ce que le bijoutier a outrepassé son droit à la légitime défense et devient automatiquement un criminel par le fait qu'il ait vraisemblablement commis un crime ? A la justice de trancher, mais c'est probable.

Est-ce qu'il y'a des circonstances particulières qui expliquent et excusent en partie l'acte ? De plus, d'un point de vue purement utilitaire l'issue de ce fait divers est elle préférable à des dizaines d'autres ?

Judging by your comment I would imagine you are pretty level headed when it comes to discussing racism, immigration, and integration. Unfortunately many European redditors (and actual Europeans I've met) dont seem to see it that way. I have heard a lot of knee-jerk comments regarding the subjects 100% blaming immigrants and refusing to acknowledge any barriers to integration there might be in their country.

You have to remember regardless of what country an immigrant comes from they will not be Dutch immediately on arrival. I would say as an American I would likely be able to integrate easier than a Moroccan if I was told I had to move to the NL tomorrow, but it certainly would not be immediate. 

And on the flip side, most of Europe, not just the NL, has issues with groups of immigrants that dont seem to want to integrate into society. The first thing I would do should I move to a new country would be to start learning the language. I understand many European nations have groups of immigrants who dont learn the language, and actively want their children to speak their native language in favor of their new host country's. 

I was almost robbed by a gang in Munich who were German in passport only. Same situation for my friends in Paris. So I dont want to gloss over the issues caused by immigration in Europe. But I think a lot of it is due to bad policies by European nations. If policies changed to favor immigrants that wanted to integrate and contribute to society I think that would go a long way in helping normally homogeneous societies accept newcomers. But that is an entirely different discussion. 

There are many reasons integration is not as successful in Europe as it is elsewhere. You cant put the blame 100% on the immigrants or Europeans, which is the way you normally see the arguments framed.

Turns out, some of the fuckers who were responsible for doing it, figured out that since the dog can never be traced back to them, they can just realise it unsterlized back in the city with a pointless collar, while getting paid of course. Talk about a fucking racket -- they can just pick up dogs and get paid for doing nothing and then do the same thing over and over again with the same dogs and the newborn pups. I'm not sure if this has been fixed yet.

But you get the idea, other than paying for the whole medical procedure, THEN you need inspectors to go over the city and check if the dogs are castrated.

Also, I'd much rather have all the dogs in the city euthanised, because it would be way cheaper. The money required to keep them alive and sterlized can be used for much more needed social programs.

Edit:

The above price is for interREGIO second class turtle speed train fare. The REGIO one is 19,80zł(4,71€), REGIOexpress is 24,90zł(5,93€). REGIO trains operate within a small area, like voivodship and stop at every train station. interREGIO connects the regions above and stops at every major stations and most smaller one near the beginning and the end of journey. REGIOexpress stops only at major stations.

Intercity trains stop in major cities and usually have fancier trains; they cost significantly more, too. Second class ticket is 68,00zł(16.18€) for 100km.

I agree that fighting your way through the tunnel from Saint-lazare to Auber during peak hours is an unpleasant struggle.

This brings up the really ugly aspect of the situation: Even if you increase the capacity of the trains, the stations are overcrowded. If you increase the capacity of the stations, the transfer tunnels are overcrowded. If you increase the capacity of the transfer tunnels, the passages to the street are overcrowded, and so on.

This is why I feel Velib has been a great thing for the city, and could be even greater if automobile traffic were progressively removed from the city center so that more space-efficient modes (buses and bicycles) could operate more smoothly, complementing the underground trains. 

The increase in bicycle traffic takes pressure off Metro without any of the cascading complications that Metro/RER capacity improvements would bring.

Sub-Saharan Africa was uncivilized before we ever showed up and only by outside intervention did they ever achieve a remotely comparable quality of life. Contrary to popular belief, the empires of Egypt were not black civilizations. Black africans were used as slaves by the egyptians for thousands of years. The nubians came into power during Egypt's decline and their rule lasted for less than 100 years before falling into obscurity. 

You could say that our meddling is making things worse. Our assistance made it possible for their population explosion and our departure left them incapable of sustaining such a population.

People will, for example, ask questions that are highly locale-dependent (e.g., legal advice, questions pertaining to social norms and customs, etc.) without bothering to mention which country they're in, and other people answer automatically assuming it's the US.  Or they will comment saying that this thing is this way (e.g., that something is permitted or not) without mentioning that they're referring specifically to the US context (legal, social or otherwise).  Even in more limited discussions, the phenomenon still occurs (e.g., when discussing academia, people will assume that students are grouped into ""undergrads"" and ""grad students"", that undergrads take courses which might be called ""Calculus 1"" in mathematics, and so on).

The /r/YouShouldKnow subreddit, for example, is rather striking: excluding computer advice, I believe a majority of what's posted there doesn't make much sense outside of the US.

This, in the broader context, of course, that everyone is assumed to know about US celebrities, American cultural references like TV shows, etc.  And be able to understand their bizarre system of units (which really doesn't bother me if the unit is at least *stated*, but if it's left implicit, that's just adding insult to injury).

Beispiel: Es gibt eine Tendenz in der Schweiz, mit dem Hochdeutschen so umzugehen wie der VdS mit dem Englischen umgehen möchte. Das wird, obwohl man vor einiger Zeit noch die Mundarten als Bereicherung der Sprache lobte, natürlich als Bedrohung angesehen. Wer offensichtlich einseitige Tiraden lesen will, dem empfehle ich Scheffel, Arndt oder von Treitschke aus dem 19. Jahrhundert, das war noch sprachgewaltig.

A ""clé 3G"" is a small receptor that usually connects on the USB port of a computer, and provides internet access using the GPRS / UMTS / LTE mobile service of an operator.

This technology will provide you with a slow (&lt;1Mbps) or very slow (&lt;56Kbps) internet access, depending on the signal strength that the receptor will receive, and on the number of users connected to the same network cell as yours.

If you're located in a town, I recommand subscribing a [Free unlimited plan](http://mobile.free.fr/index.html) for a mensual €19.90 fee (3Go / month fair-use, limited bandwith over), and using your mobile phone as a modem. Also, with a compatible phone (WPA-EAP SIM), you can seamlessly use the FreeWifi secure networks (~~although I'm not sure whether this access will be forwarded to your computer~~ EDIT: works on the Samsung Galaxy ACE).

If you don't want to use your smartphone as a modem, and live in a town, i'd recommand subscribing a [BBox Nomad 3G/4G plan](http://www.laboutique.bouyguestelecom.fr/offres-mobiles/forfaits-bbox-nomad.html) at Bouygues Telecom for €19.90 / month + €69.90 modem price (3Go / month fair-use, limited bandwith over). You will be able to login on every Bouygues Wifi hotspot.

SFR has a [cheaper offer](http://s5.s-sfr.fr/mobile/uc/00/68/79/06/FIS-3Go.pdf) (€14.99 / month, €29.99 modem) but will block your traffic if you hit the fair-use limit (3Go / month). You will be authorized to use the SFR wifi hotspots.

If your location isn't covered by UMTS (aka 3G) signal, you're screwed.
I'd advise you to have a look at the surrounding hotspots; especially if you're about to choose an operator that blocks your traffic once the fair use is over.

Free and Bouygues will provide you with a ""normal"" internet access.
Orange and SFR will block P2P and VoIP, among other things.

Faccio un esempio pratico di quello che intendevo dire fin dall'inizio:

Sei un professore che spiega come funziona il motore di una macchina. Arrivi a parlare di consumi di carburante e dici che all'aumentare della cilindrata il consumo aumenta. A questo punto, dopo aver coperto tutta la teoria del perché e del percome dei consumi, fai un esempio concreto. 

Cosa fai? Fai vedere una tabella (solo testo, in bianco e nero) con cilindrata di macchine generiche e consumi teorici? O fai una tabella con modello di macchina e marca (possibilmente con foto della macchina e logo del produttore, a colori) / cilindrata / consumo dichiarato dal produttore (magari riproducendo l'immagine di un depliant... o di una pubblicità!)? Qual'è secondo te l'esempio che rimane più impresso nella testa di un dodicenne? 

Ecco, secondo me, è il secondo esempio quello più efficace a trasmettere il senso della lezione e non ci penserei due volte a usare foto e logo di automobili vere che sono sul mercato. 

Ammetto però che, se c'è gente come te che non appena vede un logo o la foto di un prodotto grida ""Aiuto un logo!!! Vade retro publicità!!!"", col cazzo che la faccio vedere di nuovo quella tabella. I miei studenti si accontenteranno della tabella in bianco e nero, pallosa, che si dimenticheranno la settimana dopo.

But, Do they have? 

Their salary have been reduced a 30% in the last five years. [A 10% this year.](http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/07/03/greek-salaries-cut-another-10/)

They are working more for less  salary.

&gt; Greeks public servants have one of the lowest productivity in the OECD. 

If you measure the productivity per hour, Greeks stay a lot of time in the office and don't accomplish a lot And this doesn't fix it. 

We are still avoiding the elephant in the room. the reason of that is not only the productivity per hour. It's the amount of people in the payroll that doesn't work actually. 

&gt; And, you conveniently forget that this does increase the productivity. Lower cost plus more work does that. It is simple math.

This increase the productivity for the capital, the labour productivity per hour is stangant with that. 

&gt; Do you think the Greeks should get an extra week vacation (in comparison to everyone else).

Actually, Greeks get less vacation days 20 days per year. After those public servants will have 20 days per year http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statutory_minimum_employment_leave_by_country

Abd the Greek workers work [the highest number of hours  in the EU.](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=ANHRS)

A Greek works 2 034 hours per year. A Swede 1 621 hours.


&gt; Why should they get it if yes? Why is it harder for Greeks to work in front of a computer than for Estonians? Explain in detail.

What you’re saying about their sacred texts is true, but it’s also an issue about making sweeping generalizations. You could find examples all over the world, all throughout history of people committing religiously motivated acts of violence, regardless of what their doctrines say. 

And in regards to the doctrines thing… shit, the Old Testament/Torah are such a confusing mess. I recently took on the task of reading the bible (being agnostic but never having read the actual text, I figured that was a pretty important thing to do in founding my beliefs) and was amazed by what the book actually said. The Old Testament God accepts so much violence, but then only gets all fire and brimstone about other instances. And don’t even get me started on all the rape and incest. 

Shit, that’s a weird book. I don’t believe in judging Christians on what it says. Just like I don’t think I really understand Islam well enough to categorically hate muslims. However, I’ve met a handful of muslims in my University, and they are all very kind and open minded people.

I havent found too many things in the way of ""farmers markets"" on a big scale as there are fruit/veg markets in every barri but my local neighbourhood does a ""local"" producers market once a month where its all local farms and producers ie honey/breads/meats and some veg - its nice to get to know seasonal food and the prices are decent. 

Barcelona en Transició is the urban food movement here but its not very active as few people have gardens that are capable of growing much etc I am lucky as I have orange trees but i share what arrives with some marmalade making friends.

Well, they can not pay for themselves, they are getting bailouts and haircuts, so the fact that you want to give them more vacation when they can't pay for themselves at the moment means that someone else have to. The Estonians, IMF, take your pick. The only thing we know is that it will not be

They can do that when they are productive and/or paying for themselves. I do not give a flying fuck about what Greece does when they are net payer to the EU, and are paying back on their loans etc. They can have five hour weeks and vacation for wearing glasses then for all I care. However, the Greeks can not pay for themselves, and before they just borrowed, now they actually have to produce something and then other people have to pay. So, until the moment they are solvent, they should work.

They are privileged young people who still depend on their parents, so they're attracted to libertarianism because it praises self-sufficiency and independence, which is what they're trying to establish in their own lives, while at the same time it lets them justify their privilege, racism, and selfishness.

They come from a generation that produced many soldiers, yet they were either too young to go to war or went to university instead, while the nation was flooded with post 9/11 patriotic propaganda.  Therefore, they have a fascination with soldiers and admire them as archetypes of American masculinity, hence all the hero worship and ""thank you for your service"" that's in every Reddit post that involves a US soldier.

They aren't dumb.  They're just young and inexperienced.

Europe, to them, is the most challenging counterexample to their libertarianism.  It is a threat to their emotionally-comforting ideology, so they lash out at Europeans.

You are also overfishing on your, and other people's water. You are destroying the livelyhoods for Africans who are far poorer than you, and you are fishing the fishes out of the oceans.

[A shrinking Spanish fishing fleet](http://www.seafoodsource.com/newsarticledetail.aspx?id=21018)

*the Spanish fishing fleet was reduced by 24.5 percent between 2006 and 2012, decreasing from 13,398 to 10,116 vessels. The fleet’s gross tonnage also fell in this period by 19.96 percent, and its power — measured in kilowatts — dropped by 20.28 percent.*

However, I don't to discuss about this. I keep my previous stament, your concerns are valid. But, I more worried about the things that you think that aren't important. The areas where the fishing fleet is based are the more economically depressed. Cadiz has over 40% unemployment. The situation in Galicia is *better* only over 20%. 

Sorry, I am still more concerned about my silly local problems.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I am not an economist, I only see something wrong in that the country with the highest unemployment is the one with the longest working hours.

I can tell you have not studied economy. Somalia has longer working hours, as do most African countries, but low productivity. Giving them more vacation as you want to do is stupid. It a) increases the cost for the Greek state. Since the Greek state can not pay, it means for example that the Estonians will pay for it b) it lowers the productivity, which is already extremely low. 

&gt;This again?

UIntil Spain stop being a fucking spoiled lazy child criminal when it comes to the oceans, I will complain. I will never forget that you defend illegal fishing. What sort of person does that. Are you a criminal too?


&gt;the Spanish fishing fleet was reduced by 24.5 percent between 2006 and 2012, decreasing from 13,398 to 10,116 vessels. The fleet’s gross tonnage also fell in this period by 19.96 percent, and its power — measured in kilowatts — dropped by 20.28 percent.

*Everyones fishing fleets are shrinking*. Yours however are fishing far less than for example the Swedish, Canadian, British, Irish etc. We have fished 70 % of the fishes out of the sea and increased the fishing efficiency with 4 % year (roughly)since the 60's, yet yours have only shrunk with 20 %. Where do you think you fish? Ours have shrunk with 80 %, the Danish with 50. You have also been reprimaned for not shrinking it faster. Why are you so lazy? 

&gt;Sorry, I am still more concerned about my silly local problems.

So that gives you the right to take the livelehood from Africans? Your illegal fishing is starving them. Why do you do that on purpose? Does that gives you the right to fish the fishes out of the oceans for the rest of the world? Tell, me, what gave you that right?

Remember, also every single time you complain about unemployed Spanish people, you are making African fishermen unemployed and starving them. I'll bring that up in the future. You can not complain until you stop starving and making other people unemployed. It is such a cruel thing to do, yet you defend it. Asshole.

The fact that you think you have the right ito starve and fish illegaly, and maintain a far bigger fleet thatn you should, is the Spanish exceptionlism, right there. 

&gt;    Estonians, IMF, take your pick. The only thing we know is that it will not be

&gt;Why don't remove all the vacations then?

? Now you are being silly. Not surprising. But sure. 

&gt;And that's not going to happen in our lifes unless there are changes that I don't expect. We keep doing the same but we are expecting different results.

*We* are not doing the same thing, Greece is. Still low productivity, still not paying taxes, still corrupt. Perhaps they should work on that before they go on more vacation.

American - ""I love winter in maine"". (Thats great, but if i wanted to know what an americans favourite season in america is i would have gone to askreddit) 

American - ""I spent a vacation in Moscow during winter and it was beautiful""  (Thats great but you can hardly pick a favourite season with such a small experience, also russia isnt your country)


American - ""Ive lived in Denmark for 2 years and my favourite season is summer, its just so hot"" (Well thats great but those 2 summers could be freak summers or the winters could be overly harsh so you dont really have a great picture of Danish weather and, not danish)

When non-native speakers learn a language, they usually head straight to English as it is so widely spoken and understood in all corners of the globe. Many countries teach English as standard in school, starting with kids when they're very young. 

If you're a native English speaker, you're not forced to learn anything out of necessity. Most of your movies, television programmes and games are in English, when you travel to foreign countries there are usually signs in English and people speak at least some English. And if you want to learn a language? You have the ability to pretty much choose anything you want. So while some people choose to learn Spanish others choose French, or German. Most live their lives monolingual.

Yes.


&gt;The Greek government has reduced their salaries a 30% already. They can share the jobs and keep reducing the salaries.

No, they can not. Nor is that a defence for *decreasing* the productivity and *increasing* the costs like you want to. It is just stupid to increase the costs for a bankrupt country. It is also stupid to decrease the productivity for any country. 

&gt; Ok, I am excusing it with the high unemployment and the lack of other option for the fishermans. It harsh saying things like stop fishing and become an unemployed. 

How hard do you think it is for the starving Africans you are stealing from? Who the fuck defends that? 

It is also hard because you have been so extremely lazy with reducing your fishing fleet. Had you started to do it 20-30 years ago like everyone else, it wouldn't be so hard. Now you just sounds whiny, like when the Greeks complain about actually paying taxes. Spain is lazy and a criminal when it comes to fishing. Defending laxy criminals - well, it says a lot about you. 

&gt;Even If only excused more than defended.

No, you defended. You are ruining the oceans and stealing. Who defends that apart from a complete asshole? Spain is a real asshole when it comes to fishing. Anyone who defends it is an asshole to. 


&gt;Maybe, Why should they have 4 weeks of vacations and no 3 or 5? I would like to know.

They (as in the public servants) has more than four. You looked at the numbers for the legal minimum requirements. I think they have 6 or so, and more over 50. The reason they should have less is that vacation is a cost. Why should Estonians and Kenyans pay for Greeks vacation when they don't even bother to pay their taxes? 

&gt;Do you know that there are countries that fish more than Spain From Japan to Norway?

Yes, and Norway have one of the most sustainable fish industries in the world. Did you know that? Nor do they fish illegaly. Nor do they steal the livelyhood for Africans.

I was a coder for a  dissertation for political communication masters on the YES and NO campaigns for Lisbon Treaty in Ireland. The No campaign interviewees (non of which are anti-EU) complained that no matter what they did they couldn't get their arguments discussed properly into the newspapers. The papers just said that they had no alternative, when it was plain to see it was on their websites. This all with the treaty being a kamakizi run for the country economics. 

The YES side brought brought the debate down to scare tactics. With one we'll know political shouting 'where'll we get the money' on national TV. One of the YES interviewees, said that the focused on stability and insecurity because that what polled. The NO side hadn't done sufficient polling. I believe the NO side lost because the actually tried to explain their rational. The YES side used more typical spin tactics. The frame analysis; positive v negative mention in the broadsheet papers, the bias was somewhere around 5:1 Yes:No.    

There is populism on both sides. Anytime you hear, for instance that the EU is helping Greece by helping them stay in the euro, and that the consequences of leaving the euro would be disastrous etc etc. Tough decision have to be taken and that it will improve in future. that is populism in terms of communication strategy! 
The language used is always vague abstract nouns. stability, solidarity, growth, jobs, turning corners, moving forward. This is no less populist especially when you look at the insanity of the policy.

True.  The reason that I pointed out the youth of the libertarians is because libertarianism is typically a young person's ideology.  As people grow older and become more worldly, they usually realize that the ""free market"" doesn't always produce optimal results when left to its own devices, and they often gain a greater appreciation of accessible health care as they age.  

Also, they witness how people who work hard and are virtuous can suffer misfortune and often aren't properly rewarded for their work, and how all people are prone to making mistakes that cause life to take unfortunate turns.  This causes them to gain empathy for people who aren't rich professionals with a giant house in the suburbs.  They also see how unethically powerful people in business can behave, how some of them get their power by luck or despite their incompetence instead of through hard work and superior ability, and how wasteful private industry can be, and thus they tend to stop worshiping the Ayn Rand idea of ""ubermensch"" captains of industry who would lead us all into paradise if it weren't for the big bad government that holds them back.",0,1379298631,null,0,1379299520,0,cc9619c,t3_1mfnuw,t1_cc9619c,t1_cc92ehg,null,1429449596,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

It was the criticism of America that I heard most often.

In the US, vacation time is considered a luxury; if the law mandated long, European-style vacations, many Americans would call it an attack on freedom because it would be the government forcing employers to do something.  The classic American view of freedom (absence of government interference) would deride such a law as an infringement of the right of employers and workers to form whatever employment contract they want.

Europeans are more likely to view freedom as the ability to do things, like take time off to pursue a hobby or travel, while Americans are more likely to view freedom as an absence of government-imposed rules.

true,matude,ESTO,Estland,"In Estonia, and seemingly elsewhere in Northern Europe too, work is respected and encouraged. We have sayings like ""Get to work early, get to bed late, that's how wealth was brought to home."" Some of it was solidified by soviet work propaganda, but most of it comes from way earlier times. For example one saying ""when the sun dawns, countryman feeds the horse"" was first written in 1583. I've heard people connect it to the Lutheran mindset, but I've got no info on it. Those who ""don't do something"", ""don't work"", ""don't strive towards a goal of some kind"" are sometimes regarded as hopeless and useless. :D  

Talking with complete strangers in a situation where there's nothing connecting the two of you doesn't happen, for example in a queue or on a public bus. But if something happens in said situation, say the bus stops due to an accident on the road, people might nod to each-other and utter a few words of acknowledgement like ""mmm yes this is a bad situation indeed"", older people might chat about some previous situation of similar kind from a few decades ago. Another old saying that perfectly summarizes the attitude of a typical 60+ year old Estonian man working on a field: ""Work when it's work time, chat when it's chat time.""   

It's respectful to be on time, within 1-3 minutes of the agreed upon time, 5 minutes late is already late enough to be mentioned with a sarcastic comment, but usually fine. Being late is frowned upon and when it comes to business it's unacceptable/impossible.  

Money is handed on the counter at a store, what seems like a goal to minimize human interaction and the possibility of hands touching. :D Also nobody asks you how your day was, because the clerk doesn't care and neither does an Estonian enough to tell anybody about it. :D  

This compared to the general relaxed, chatty and flexible attitude of some southern European countries can definitely feel strange and foreign to some.

Belgium has 100% debt-to-GDP ratio, also since decades ago, but most of that debt is internal. Belgium was in a crisis 2 years ago when the government had to pay more than 4%. Since then the interest rate has dropped and we now have to pay marginally more than Germany.

Belgium has a lot of challenges ahead but luckily most of these challenges are very similar to Germany. Belgium is very conservative when it comes to economic policy changes. For example, we have an acute problem replacing people going into retirement but not enough educated people to replace them. Also, government employees are forced to go into retirement at 65 even if they want to continue to work.

That being said people retire too early in Belgium. It's not uncommon gor people to retire at 55. This is gradually changed but the difficulty lies in the baby boomer generation that expects to retire early. Politicians don't want to yank their retirement age up because these people are the biggest voter block.

true,DejaBoo,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; what's your definition of racism?

I'm not the person you are responding to but here's the catcher **if** you want an honest academic response.  There are three definitions from memory.

* you recognize race exist (so we are all racists)
* You attribute any superiority or inferiority to any race (super common and so most all of us are racist)
* you attribute superiority to your race and inferiority to others in a hateful manner (all to common and projected too often on reddit when the comments are hopefully meant as humor).

The latter one is obviously very dangerous because of the terrible history we all know to well of oppression, slavery and eugenics (e.g., sterilizations, genocide).  There has been a notable increase on reddit, imo, since the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin debacle and I will explain why.  But first the biggest danger is reddit is open to youth and as such those minds are impressionable.  The plus side it creates an open discourse to talk about racism.  This part I am very hopeful about.

The first bullet point is crucial for us all to recognize for us to get over for the political bullshit but it has been politicized.  Here in the USA the Trayvon Martin is a classic example with a person below you mentioning racism comes out in droves on reddit.  However the real racism has been the *still* demonizers of George Zimmerman.  Obviously there is crucial complexities and innuendo that blacks can *read* into what happened that night from their life experiences **BUT** there is absolutely no evidence that is the case nor is there any evidence that George Zimmerman has been racist towards African Americans in his life (period).  In fact, quite the contrary and that's why reddit is really backlashed on the case and those who blindly rally Trayvon Martin was the victim of racism as call for racism are actually being the ""Racists"" (e.g., many peeps on with monthly updates during the crucial period at /r/hiphopheads) just the same as other groups who rally and still do around George Zimmerman (e.g., /r/trayvonmartin).  

If anyone remembers when this case first hit reddit en masse was not backing George Zimmerman at all.  It wasn't till the facts came out with the trial.  I watched the entire case, read the entire notes of the [FBI investigators \(starts page 97\)](http://www.clickorlando.com/blob/view/-/15490330/data/1/-/kligxm/-/Zimmerman-documents.pdf), and it's just not there.  This falls under what we call ""racism vulnerability"" where people who have faced racism against them repeatedly in their life begin to assume all events are the consequence of racism.

In short it really says something when reddit is overall outspoken liberal and came running to lynch George Zimmerman has woken up to the media spun play narrative of the case.  One in which the news media had to keep playing to keep their viewers during the trial.  The worst example was how the ""star witness"" Rachel Jeantel admits on stand to avoid another perjury charge that she had lied during her deposition with District Attorney to help Trayvon Martin's Mother get George Zimmerman Arrested.  I have yet to hear that played on any news network.  Instead the ""white ass cracker"" got played by only a few select news networks.

This should have never gone to trial --EVER!

tl;dr Race baiter Al Sharpton et. al, they bet on the wrong case and they should be the ones to blame every time you see a joke on reddit today, and I, Dejaboo am a racist...

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"I am not German, so please explain if I am wrong, but it sounds like you are talking about a prohibition on the state interfering with negotiations between labor unions and companies (labour relations).  In my post, I was referring to laws that protect employee rights.  Those are quite different.   I would be very surprised if Germans thought that laws that mandate rights for employees went against freedom.

This might surprise you, but there are very few laws that protect worker's rights in the US.  In most states, employers can fire employees without having to give a reason and with no recourse for the employee (""right to work"" states).  There is no requirement that employees get vacation or paid time off for illness.  Until ""Obamacare,"" there was no requirement (in most states) that employers provide health insurance for employees.

Many Americans are against legal protections for worker's rights.  They think it is a violation of freedom for the government to prohibit certain employment arrangements, like ones where employees get no benefits.  They believe that employers should get to run their businesses however they please, because they own the business.

Also, I did some research about German vacation laws:

Quote: ""Germans have much more paid time off than do the Greeks and their economy is doing much better than [America's] – as well as the rest of Europe’s. According to a 2011 Eurofound study, “Coupled with public holidays, the average German has 40 days of holiday a year — still tied with the Danes for the most in Europe. Greeks and Portuguese by comparison each average 33 days vacation a year, including public holidays.”

Meanwhile, from the same article:

Quote: In the U.S. there is no legal obligation [to get a vacation from work] at all. If you get a paid vacation it’s either because the company “gave” it to you or because you achieved it through collective bargaining.

[Source for both quotes](http://www.salon.com/2012/07/05/europes_amazing_vacation_laws/)

true,SpanishNinjitsu,null,null,"&gt; A country with a 10% deficit can not function long term. Fixing that will take cuts in everything: public salaries, education, healthcare, administration.

Balancing a budget is economics, choosing where those cuts will be done is politics. 

Let's not get into the legitimacy of this country's national debt since apparently there is nothing to be done about it: a robust healthcare and education system fosters consumption by making sure all citizens have their basic needs covered and can therefore spend their money in a more diverse fashion. Most European countries work under this principle.

Our salaries have been dwindling dramatically since the crisis started and now 1 of every 4 Spaniards lives in poverty, consumption amongst the middle class has shrunk to economy-destroying levels. If you add further cuts into basic infrastructures such as education you end up with the kind of mess we currently have in Spain.

Now, I have no doubt we'll end coming out of the crisis. As you mention we might be having a lower deficit this year and some economic indicators (CPI for example) point to a slow recovery. The question is whether the Spanish middle class will be worthy of that name by the time this is over or not.

No, they almost certainly do *not*! I believe that was the whole point of op's question. Or have you ever had luck buying Aspirin at a Rossmann's? Or do you actually think that Paracetamol requires a prescription in Germany?

In many other countries you can, indeed buy everything that doesn't require a doctor's prescription just about everywhere. You can get can everything from strong Paracetamol to Pseudoephedrine at a US ""drug store"" (Drogerie). The strongest pills that actually have some medical use you can get at a German drug store contain small doses of valerian and hops, the rest is vitamins, salts or homeopathic sugar pills.

The ""[Apothekenpflicht](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothekenpflicht)"" for medicine that *doesn't* require any form of prescription, but can still only be purchased from a licensed pharmacy is common in Mid-Europe, but not common on a global scale.

Basically, all medicine that actually works and claims to work are ""pharmacy-only drugs"" ... if they require a prescription or not.

And while there always is an emergency pharmacy within a 30km radius ... if you actually go to one to buy some aspirin they'll be quite angry at you for wasting ruining their dinner/night/weekend.

----

These might be only weird in some countries, not in the others:

- Don't smile. If you smile to people on the street you are either drunk, retarded, a creep or a paedophile.

- You don't call every person you know ""friend"". There are multiple levels of relationship with other people. A man you know could be znajomy(acquaintance), kolega(colleague), przyjaciel(friend). It takes effort to be called a friend of someone.

- If someone is waiting by the pedestrian crossing to cross the street, don't stop. If they wanted to cross the street they would have already been on the zebra crossing.

Another thing is ""załatwianie"" various things:

The word załatwić has various meanings, depending on the context.
Here are some usage examples(the expressions in parentheses express the meaning of ""załatwić""):

- Muszę załatwić z tobą pewną sprawę - I have to (talk with you) about an issue.

- Załatwisz mi miejsce w miejscowym hotelu? - Could you (book me) a room in the local hotel, please?

- Muszę załatwić sprawę w skarbówce - I have to (solve an issue) in the  Inland revenue office.

- Załatwię ci tę pracę - I (will do my best to get) you the job.

- Muszę się załatwić - I have to (pee).

[in a surgery, patient-doctor dialog:]

- Najbliższy wolny termin operacji to 2123 rok. - The soonest the surgery can take place is 2123.

- Czy nie dałoby się załatwić krótszego terminu? - Can I (do something) to book the operation sooner? [Pulls out an envelope and places it inside the pocket of the doctor]

- Załatwione! Operacja będzie jutro! - (Done)! The operation can take place tomorrow.

And a more vulgar example:

- Załatwię cię, skurwielu - I will (kill you), you son of a bitch

As you can see, the word ""załatwić"" has multiple meanings. Usually it implies at least a bit immoral deed - for example using bribes, knowing the right people. It was closely tied to communism in Poland. 

For example If you knew a miner you could have possibly put your hands on some cheaper coal - ""załatwić"" some cheaper coal. With that coal, you could possibly ""Załatwić""(get) some meat at the butcher's (there were times when the shelves at the shops were literally empty - there was nothing except maybe for some vinegar). If the meat was of good quality you could offer it to a doctor to ""załatwić""[in exchange for] skipping the line for hip surgeries. 

Were you working at a chemical plant? You could ""załatwić""(steal) some brake fluid, then exchange it with Mr. Heniu who had just returned from Germany with some new cassette players. After you ""załatwiłeś""(exchanged) the fluid for a cassette player, you recalled that your brother, Zdzisiu, is illegally selling the Beatles records on the black market. Your brother claims that he knows a guy looking for the very cassette player you have, and the guy can ""Załatwić twoim dzieciom""(send your children) for a trip to Yugoslavia for half the normal price.

The open-pit mining project will use cyanide to extract gold and it is expected to require the razing of three villages and destroy four mountain tops. If approved, it would be Europe's largest open-pit gold mine and it will result in 314 tonnes of gold and 1500 tonnes of silver.
&gt;
&gt; The Romanian government approved a new draft law needed for the Roșia Montană Project in late August 2013 and it forwarded it to the Parliament which had to vote on it in September.
&gt;
&gt; Activists involved in the Roșia Montană campaign claim that the project would cause an environment disaster, that it would destroy the ancient Roman archeological sites and that the project involved handling assets to the Canadian company, while the Romanian state would earn too little out of the project. Another concern was the fact that the legislation would give the Roșia Montană Gold Corporation the right to give compulsory purchase orders to the residents of Roșia Montană who refused to sell their houses and lands.

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"&gt; Je suis d'accord avec tout sauf pour ton point 3. Je suis sûre qu'on en aurait entendu parler. Un jeune père récidiviste de la communauté des gens du voyage qui tue un pauvre bijoutier qui a déjà été cambriolé, c'est la cible idéale et certaines personnes sauteraient sur l'occasion pour parler ensuite d'insécurité, des étrangers en France, de la racaille à karsher ect.

Sûrement, mais on aurait mis ça sur le compte du braquage qui tourne mal (y'en a régulièrement) au-delà d'une récupération très éphémère par la droite de la droite, je ne suis pas certain que cela aurait provoqué un vrai début de débat.

&gt; Je peux comprendre l'exasperation du bijoutier, la haine de se faire voler uen deuxième fois, et tout ces sentiments d'injustice mais bon, il aurait quand même du réfléchir à deux fois.

Parler d'exaspération est une exagération, je pense. Au stade auquel il a agi, il était encore sous un choc immédiat et je ne pense pas qu'il ait pu agir consciemment pour venger une agression précédente ou quoique ce soit du genre. Le coup de sang me paraît plus probable qu'autre chose.

&gt; Il aurait pu blesser des passants

Entièrement d'accord. Sortir dans l'espace public pour tirer sur un cible mouvante alors qu'il est encore en état de choc (effet ""tunnel"" sur sa vision, adrénaline, etc), c'est presque une garantie de toucher un innocent.

&gt; et puis le jeune était une racaille mais ça ne veut pas dire qu'il n'était pas aimé par sa famille, sa copine enceinte et ses amis. 

Là je ne suis pas tout à fait d'accord. Je ne pense pas qu'il ""méritait"" de mourir à proprement parler, mais ce n'est pas non plus à un particulier qui vient d'être molesté de garantir la sécurité d'un individu qui vient de commettre un crime violent et qui ne semble pas manifester de volonté de se rendre.

Quand on se met volontairement dans une situation aussi dangereuse et en dehors de tout cadre légal, on ne peut s'en prendre qu'à soi même si il y'a des conséquences négatives. Le bijoutier a sûrement fauté et mérite vraisemblablement une sanction, mais le braqueur est responsable des conséquences des actes qui ont entraîné cette séquence d'événements.

&gt; Finalement, si tout le monde fait justice soit meme, on s'en sort plus. Il y a une raison pour laquelle il y a des règles.

Entièrement d'accord. Mon seul souci c'est que comme dit plus haut, l'acte est quelque part entre la légitime défense et la vendetta, mais ce n'est pas un vrai règlement de comptes non plus car il a été commis quand l'acte de fuite était encore en cours.

2008 through to late 2011, the official (Berlusconi) government line was that everything was fine. We had no major meltdowns and the government felt no need to act preemptively to prevent future problems; it actually chose to eliminate property taxes on *everything*, creating a serious budget hole that would later come back to haunt us.

In late 2011, our sins caught up with us. The sorry state of our finances and our government's complete inability to act prompted a massive spike in bond interest rates, bringing the country very close to financial disaster. Berlusconi was ousted and Mario Monti, a well-respected economist, was brought in. 

Monti's government enacted a package of emergency austerity measures including massive spending cuts, a pension reform and the reintroduction of property taxes. At the same time, the ECB started aggressively buying Italian bonds on the secondary market, while making it clear that it would use all of its considerable resources to prevent a disastrous bankruptcy of the country.

Interest rates started to fall, but the economy was hit hard by the combination of austerity measures, a devastating credit crunch and the global depression. Unemployment spiked, businesses started to close by the hundreds and then thousands and our GDP fell trimester after trimester.

Monti's government lasted a bit more than a year, when a resurgent Berlusconi withdrew his party's support and launched a populist election campaign centered around an end to austerity and a promised economic miracle.

Elections in early 2013 resulted in a three-way split of Parliament. Months of indecisive attempts resulted in a coalition government supported by Berlusconi's center-right and the center-left.

Lack of a clear vision, extremely divergent views and Berusconi's own preoccupation with saving his hide from criminal prosecution resulted in a mostly paralyzed government that has promised a lot and done very little. Our economy is still in free-fall even as government official are talking of ""signs of recovery"" (one must assume they have collectively picked up tasseography).

The future appears bleak as desperately urgent measures are postponed month after month while the coalition parties try to navigate around Berlusconi's judicial woes (he stands to lose his Senatorial seat and threatens to pull support for the government if this happens). Everything has effectively been put on hold until this issue is resolved, which might take until mid-October.",0,1379331244,null,0,false,0,cc9d524,t3_1mhcus,t1_cc9d524,t3_1mhcus,null,1429446208,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

If a territory of an EU state declares its independence , automatically ceases to belong to the European Union and becomes "" a third country"" . So replied on Monday the European Commission to the growing demands of the Government of Catalonia and independence sectors on the right to decide their own state . Without wanting to name at any time the Catalan situation , and reiterating that Brussels is limited remember what is written in the treaties , the EU executive 's spokesman has said that in the event of secession , Community rules "" no longer apply "" to the territory proclaimed its independence .

Although this position is to reiterate past statements, Brussels has decided this morning to rule indirectly on the Catalan question when asked by reporters, when avoided last week to respond to such major demonstration after the Diada. Brussels spokeswoman added that for the Commission to rule on the issue formally Catalan has to request the Member State concerned , in this case Spain , something that has not happened . She also pointed out , though, that any new or existing state - can apply to join the European Union.

The spokesman reinforces the clearest message sent this morning by Vice President of the Commission responsible for competition , Joaquin Almunia , who has shown sharp on the future of Catalonia in the EU if it becomes independent from Spain : "" The party is not a member secreted EU "" . During a conference at the CIDOB on Commitment to Europe , the Commissioner stated his appreciation for Catalonia, and urged the central government to try and Catalan political future "" in a table face to face and with a cool head "" rather of by letter. In October last year , in Madrid, Catalonia Almunia said and stop being part of the euro if it finally became independent from Spain , as suggested by the EU treaty .

The Minister of Economy and Knowledge of Catalonia, Andreu Mas - Colell , present at the conference , said that Almunia 's statements are a "" legal reading "" strict , but there are cases where it is negotiating , as the Scottish , and not think to end Scotland outside the EU , which plays the same for Catalonia.

"" The EU is regarded with concern the situation in Catalonia. Ask me constantly and not always with sympathy "" , said Almunia . "" All we ask that you seek ways in which the situation is channeled ."" Just this afternoon the president of the Parliament , Joan Rigol , presents the manifesto for the right to decide , a text that has agreed with political parties and institutions.

Moreover, Almunia said he sees ""positive signs "" in the economy of the whole EU , with countries that do not talk of crisis and others that are still in recession but see signs of improvement , as the periphery , where included Spain - , but has warned that no throwing from the rooftops : ""It will be a slow recovery fragile , rickety and risk environment .""",0,1379333436,null,0,1379335357,0,cc9dhao,t3_1mhv3u,t1_cc9dhao,t3_1mhv3u,null,1429446050,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Ich finde es absolut abscheulich, mit welch beißendem Sarkasmus der OP an diese Sache rangeht. Es handelt sich hierbei um nichts worüber man Witze machen sollte, sondern um das Leid von vielen tausend Kindern die aufgrund fehlgeleiteter Ideologien missbraucht und seelisch verkrüppelt wurden.

Nachdem ich das gesagt habe, möchte ich klar stellen, dass ich keinerlei Verständnis für irgendwelche Menschen habe, die versuchen diese Verbrechen und den Zusammenhang mit den Grünen zu leugnen oder zu relativieren.

Ich selbst wurde von meinem Stiefvater mit den selben Versprechen missbraucht, welche die Grundlage für die Grüne Ideologie der sexuellen Befreiung waren. Er sagte er wolle mir helfen mich zu entdecken, mich gut zu fühlen und er würde mich nur streicheln. Ich war damals 7 und es war mir nicht klar, dass das, was er mit mir tut, hochgradig verwerflich ist. Auch wusste ich nicht, welchen Einfluss es später auf mein Leben haben würde.

Jeder, der behauptet der Sex solle ja nur einvernehmlich stattfinden und dann sei das alles gar kein Problem(also eben so, wie es Beck, Bendit und Trittin taten) ist ein LÜGNER!

Ich dachte mir damals auch nichts dabei und wurde auch nicht gezwungen etwas zu tun. Ich wurde darum gebeten aber dachte mir nichts dabei. Und wenn er sagte ""Nimm in in den Mund"" dann tat ich es.

true,rensch,NETH,The Netherlands,"A few examples of our old-fashioned ""time is money"" calvinism:

Especially in urban areas, bikes are a better option in many situations than cars. Apparently, the bikes lanes are unusual in other countries. They led to a cycling culture that is often perceived as strange yet effective. Efficient as we are, we even eat our breakfast on our bikes sometimes when we are late for work. There is something very comforting in the idea that even the Prime Minister goes to work by bike. I guess it is that safe in our country. Just make sure you lock your bike, especially at train stations, because thugs steal them all the fucking time like they are made of gold. Don't leave them near the famous canals of our city centers, either. You are asking for trouble if you do.

Another example of our efficiency comes in the form of what we call 'eating out of the wall'. There are these dispensers at snack bars that really put the 'fast' back in fast food. Just like a can of coke, you can get freshly fried sausages, hamburgers and chicken out of a dispenser. This saves time when you are in a hurry (which we always are). Unsurprisingly, you find them at train stations a lot. Why this great contribution to the technological prowess of the human race as a whole hasn't caught on in other nations is beyond me.

It should go without saying by now that you should never leave a Dutch person waiting at an appointment. Never. Now you also know why we whine about train delays all the fucking time, especially during winter: it costs time and time is money.",0,1379343966,null,0,false,0,cc9g3oe,t3_1mhclv,t1_cc9g3oe,t3_1mhclv,null,1429444825,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5
