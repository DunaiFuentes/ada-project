true,vertumne,EURO,Slovenia,"I completely understand where you're coming from, because on the surface the issue really does look like one of common-sense - that's why it's so hard to change the narrative here.

Because what you're engaging in here, is at the end, victim-blaming. Where were you deploring the profligacy of the South when German and French banks were buying up City of London and Wall Street CDS's and financing all kinds of bubbles anywhere they could find them? The music was playing and nobody cared what anybody does with the money, everyone was chasing a higher yield and nobody wanted to check the fundamentals of economies, because the world seemed so sweet.

When the music stopped (when Goldman Sachs initiated a sell-off and broke the market), that's when things got interesting. Where were you yelling for the bankruptcy of banks leveraged to the tilt with non-performing loans? Where were you yelling that unsound business practices of said banks were not to be rewarded? German banks were declared too big to fail - German taxpayers rescued those banks but the political cost of this was the bleeding of the South. Not the bleeding of domestic banks (because that's against patriotic principles, hurr durr) but the bleeding of foreign nationals.

""Our poor banks thought that everything will work out fine, but those lazy southerners ate all our money and gave us their shit in return."" So the poor banks were rescued with German money - yet the economies that have been growing for the past 10 years under the assumption that access to credit was easy were punished for this assumption. Now suddenly their access is gone, and their economies have to undergo austerity - which is, viewed through a modern monetary lense, pure value destruction for the sake of future growth prospects. The only rational and moral thing to do here, would be to reform and restructure the economy (via diktat, for all I care), while at the same time ensuring that the people don't needlessly suffer. It could be done with sufficient pressure at the political class to instigate reform - without having their own constituents protesting in the streets.

If the Troika said today - we want these specific reforms to be enacted designed to help your economies, and in the same time we will do Eurobonds to, in effect, pay off your constituents with direct cash transfers so they let them go through (which would also sustain demand), we would be back on top in no time. However, the corruption of the political class is so heavily engrained that they would rather continue in this vein of playing states against each other, continue with the graft and waste, let unemployment rise to 30%, stuff their pockets and fuck Europe. And the Germans (and Finland) don't care one way or another, as long as they don't have to pay another dime.

Ordinary folk on the street had nothing to do with neither excessive borrowing, nor corruption and waste. Yet they are the ones left holding the bag for the financial scheming and political manouvering of people who were supposed to be there to make this EU dream come true. As long as things remain like this, there is no future on this continent, and that is a direct insult to the efforts of all our ancestors (who were dying in droves so we can live the lives we live today).",0,1366806860,null,0,false,0,c9lm6w5,t3_1cxlh9,t1_c9lm6w5,t1_c9ljo4r,null,1431446485,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,meidei,ANAR,isyanάσταση!,"What I am trying to say is that in some countries the laws don't treat minorities equally. And that's how the laws are. 
Eg: If I attack a 3rd party immigrant for any reason, that counts as them getting involved in fights and they risk being deported. Even if simply attacked them due to my prejudice, nothing more. And I can probably walk away the first time, because the first time all I get is a warning (personal experience here, from when I called the police on someone who attacked me). 

There's also the matter of how prejudice doesn't count as a motive, so the police files don't keep statistics of that kind of crimes. Eg you can as well say that LGBTs aren't attacked in Cyprus, but that's just because the police doesn't recognise that a person can be attacked for their status as LGBT alone. And with the statistics giving that false image, you can't protect efficiently those people. 

&gt; Do you agree with that principle?

It does make me uncomfortable. But I recognise that not all cultures deal with the same problems. With LGBTs and/or racial minorities de facto treated as non-human entities, a temporary hate crime law can provide some substantial safety to those people, combined with other initiatives to discourage violence. In this context I always here that we should educate people and make them see past the stereotypes blah blah blah, but even if it's their responsibility to educate racists (which is not), it's the state's responsibility to keep them alive and safe enough in order to educate. And hate crime laws do their part to discourage such violence. Again, it's not something I'd like to see existing forever.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Because what you're engaging in here, is at the end, victim-blaming. Where were you deploring the profligacy of the South when German and French banks were buying up City of London and Wall Street CDS's and financing all kinds of bubbles anywhere they could find them? The music was playing and nobody cared what anybody does with the money, everyone was chasing a higher yield and nobody wanted to check the fundamentals of economies, because the world seemed so sweet.

Victim blaming? No, that what I'm putting is responsibility to where it belongs. Responsibility of loaners is to make sure that they are sure that they can pay it back. Responsibility of creditors is to ensure that they loan and invest where they can get their money back. Responsibility of bank and other financial institutions regulators is to make sure that the risks that they pose are under acceptable levels.

Yes, investors and creditors made a mistake on trusting currently troubled countries too much, but then again how many French, German and American banks has the European taxpayer have to bailout... 0... If the French, Germans and Americans would have thrown their hands up and said, we can't deal with this, they would get their share of blame, but that hasn't happened. What has happened is that number of European countries have gone essentially bankrupt. 

&gt; When the music stopped (when Goldman Sachs initiated a sell-off and broke the market), that's when things got interesting. Where were you yelling for the bankruptcy of banks leveraged to the tilt with non-performing loans? Where were you yelling that unsound business practices of said banks were not to be rewarded? German banks were declared too big to fail - German taxpayers rescued those banks but the political cost of this was the bleeding of the South. Not the bleeding of domestic banks (because that's against patriotic principles, hurr durr) but the bleeding of foreign nationals.

First of all, for Germans it would have been much cheaper option for troubled states to declare defaults than loan money to keep them running. Secondly don't forget that the states themselves wanted to be bailed out, they could have defaulted, but they would have had to implement all austerity measures and more in one day, because they wouldn't have had money to do anything else.

&gt; ""Our poor banks thought that everything will work out fine, but those lazy southerners ate all our money and gave us their shit in return."" So the poor banks were rescued with German money - yet the economies that have been growing for the past 10 years under the assumption that access to credit was easy were punished for this assumption. Now suddenly their access is gone, and their economies have to undergo austerity - which is, viewed through a modern monetary lense, pure value destruction for the sake of future growth prospects. 

No. What happened for example in Spain is both public and private sector made investments not based on sound business plans. If the state had actually bothered to do cost-return analysis on public investment projects, most of the motorways, high speed railways and airports would have not been build.

For example, do you know how long it took for the Finnish state to build motorway between Helsinki, capital, to Turku, third largest city, for a distance of approx 160km? The construction started in 1956 and it ended in 2009. The state simply calculated that they can't afford to do it in one leg, instead they have build it decade after decade in shorter spans. The same is true with virtually all infrastructure building up here, the state very carefully calculates what it can afford, and what not.

Again, it is the responsibility of the loaner to make sure that loans can be paid back.

&gt; The only rational and moral thing to do here, would be to reform and restructure the economy (via diktat, for all I care), while at the same time ensuring that the people don't needlessly suffer. It could be done with sufficient pressure at the political class to instigate reform - without having their own constituents protesting in the streets.

Define what is needlessly to suffer? Do remember that Eurozone also includes countries such as Estonia and Slovakia, anything that is offered to troubled states can't be more than their own citizens expect from their state.

&gt; If the Troika said today - we want these specific reforms to be enacted designed to help your economies, and in the same time we will do Eurobonds to, in effect, pay off your constituents with direct cash transfers so they let them go through (which would also sustain demand), we would be back on top in no time. However, the corruption of the political class is so heavily engrained that they would rather continue in this vein of playing states against each other, continue with the graft and waste, let unemployment rise to 30%, stuff their pockets and fuck Europe. And the Germans (and Finland) don't care one way or another, as long as they don't have to pay another dime.

Member states of the EU are democracies. People get politicians and leaders that they deserve.

&gt; Ordinary folk on the street had nothing to do with neither excessive borrowing, nor corruption and waste. Yet they are the ones left holding the bag for the financial scheming and political manouvering of people who were supposed to be there to make this EU dream come true. As long as things remain like this, there is no future on this continent, and that is a direct insult to the efforts of all our ancestors (who were dying in droves so we can live the lives we live today).

Ordinary folk on the street have everything to do with it. They voted and elected leaders that they had. They also enjoyed the good times, having higher employment thanks to construction and property bubbles, thanks to state employing more people, paying more generously. Nope. Ordinary folks have everything to do with this and also everything to do with how to solve this mess.

&gt; As long as things remain like this, there is no future on this continent, and that is a direct insult to the efforts of all our ancestors (who were dying in droves so we can live the lives we live today).

What that even means in this context?

In 20th century we had one bunch of stupid nazis who said some people are generally superior to others, and another bunch of stupid lefties saying no everybody is equal. We need to drop both and think realistically: that different peoples are good at different things.

Southern Europe is good at enjoying life. Northern Europe is good at making money in a bit of a puritan, bland way. Yes, these cultural differences contribute to different economic outcomes. But this is not really a general inferiority, but more like being good at different things.

However, I would say that _political culture_ is often seriously inferior at nations with economic problems. There is a general inabiliity to elect motivated, knowledgeable candidates, form political opinions in an objective way, expect results, expect them to deliver, and drop them if they don't. Such political cultures are often riddled with new and new political hopefuls becoming corrupted, dumb populism, thoughtless worshipping of international instittutions, generaly apathy ""one party is just as bad as the other"", and politics turned into a theater play. While people in succesful countries often vote like ""I want this and this done and I will support this guy as long as I believe he will do it"", countries with economic problems often vote like ""my grandpa was a miner, I am a lifelong socialist party voter"" or ""I go to church, the center-right party for me forever"" regardless of what is the actual ""track performance"".",0,1366810634,null,0,1366810937,0,c9ln2gq,t3_1d05zd,t1_c9ln2gq,t3_1d05zd,null,1431446000,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Quindi se si vuole cambiare qualcosa, a lungo termine bisogna lavorare sull'ignoranza. Quindi:

* migliorare il livello delle scuole, e degli insegnanti. Soffermarsi di piu' sugli strumenti di analisi critica e sull'educazione civica in generale, anche sulla storia se vogliamo, oltre che sulle nozioni
* pluralita' dell'informazione, non tutte le tv e i giornali in mano a un unica persona (mafiosa)
* arginare in qualche modo la stupidita' dilagante della televisione. Non so cosa si possa fare di concreto, ma tra programmi culturali ""paranormali"", baggianate di pseudo reality studiati a tavolino e telenovele celebrolese, l'effetto secondo me e' devastante.

This exact point is all to easily forgotten when we and everyone else discuss austerity. There's been a big 'enlightenment' recently, especially regarding the case of the [Reinhart-Rogoff study](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/reinhart-rogoff-austerity-research-errors_n_3094015.html), and now suddenly everyone has come to the realization that austerity is bad = the policies laid forth in the Eurozone the past years has been completely wrong.

But the initial problem Greece and the rest of southern Europe was (and to some extent still is) facing was lack of confidence in the market. And that lack of confidence doesn't have a thing to do with the 'truth behind public macro economics'. If the market for a period of time believed in Reinhart-Rogoff, then the European politicians would have to act accordingly in order to control the interest rates. That's what they have been doing until now, and I fail to see how that is anything but very responsible.

All in all this has nothing to do with an objective truth of how you ideally macro manage a country's economy - instead it has everything to do with ""the hysterical bitches of the stock exchange"" - to paraphrase a former Danish Minister of Economy, Mogens Lykketoft.",0,1366813734,null,0,false,0,c9lnz2q,t3_1d09ks,t1_c9lnz2q,t3_1d09ks,null,1431445573,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Oppure se il venditore della tua moto accettasse un semplice documento firmato da te come delega, sarebbe troppo facile falsificarlo, primo perche' non conosce la tua firma, secondo perche' le firme sono semplici da falsificare.

&gt; The concept of multiple owners for these networks is also fundamental to the free market and competition.

Not it's not. What is important is [unbundled access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbundled_access) the best way to guarantee it is for the state to own it.

It's not a matter of buying into it. This is a fact. It is a huge economic inefficiency to duplicate networks.

Ist ja auch unsinning zu drosseln. Wenn alle am Samstag Abend surfen, dann muss das Netz das Abkönnen, die übrige Bandbreite spielt dann weniger eine Rolle. Zudem ist wie gesagt Traffic für die Telekom vermutlich quasi kostenlos.

Falls das die obigen wilden Spekulationen also halbwegs wahr sind, bleibt im Zusammenhang mit dem Zeit-Artikel nur die Theorie, dass die Telekom gezielt Geld verdienen will indem sie andere Inhaltsanbieter um Netzzugang erpresst und massiv Kunden an die eigenen Multimedia-Plattformen binden will.

Yeah.

&gt; The new owners cancelled the lase multiple times, but there was something wrong with the lease conditions and the local court has been investigating it for the last few months.

So just the ownership of the property changed (city to private company), the lease holder wants to finish his contract and the now owner tries to get it by force. I thought they only wanted to change the lease partner, it makes a bit of sense now. Still really strange that the police isn't doing anything when a bunch of people run around with assault rifles, even if the property belongs to their boss.

I apologise for my stupidity but, you see, I've never understood why it was a good thing to ""*create jobs*"". It's like saying that whereas something doesn't need to be done, we will have someone do it anyway. To me ""*creating jobs*"" is another way of saying ""*creating chores*"". 

As a simpleton, I ask whether the produced goods are enough for all the people in a society? 

Yes?  We produce so much crap that a lot of it it made to break down **on purpose** in order to be thrown away (""planned obsolescence"")? With food there is even such a thing as a ""diet"" industry ... where there is so much shit available for consumption that we are spending money on not becoming obese from it? We actually produce **too much** shit?

Well, excellent then! This means that we don't necessarily constantly need to produce yet more crap. We, in other words, don't need to create more jobs. Necessity I can understand but why should we ... as a principle ... want to stick everybody in factories, sweatshop, cubicles etc if and when it is not necessary? 

I find it all quite fascinating really. Remember the Utopia that all human progress was and is supposed to be aiming at? Imagine we were there. It would be an opportunity, would it not? People would be able to study, travel, to go to museums, to go concerts, follow sports ... **do** sports, become athletes, artists, writers, thinkers, philosophers, explore space, do pure science (real actual science not commerce). Humans would finally be worthy of the name ""*sapiens*"".

But instead ... even if we could have robots doing most of the necessary work, ... according to our current mentality this would be  a **bad** thing. Why?  Well ... if machines do the work, less needs to be done ... and this ... ""***increases unemployment***"". That's apparently to be avoided.

Camping with a tent is not allowed anywhere except on designated camping sites. Camping with just a sleeping bag and tarp can be done anywhere, but care, a lot of people don't know the difference, so just stay a bit hidden to avoid silly discussions.  
If you keep hidden, set up camp at dusk and pack up at dawn, don't start fires and keep the place clean, there won't be any problems most likely, even with a tent. If you get cought, which happens nearly never, most just tell you to pack up and leave, and even if the Cop is a dick, it should be just a ~10€ fine. Still cheaper than some camping sites. (Only the police is ""Weisungsbefugt"" (allowed to force you to do stuff), hunters and other woodsmen have no authority. But can call the cops, ofc. If you are no dick, they most likely won't. And even if they do, just pack up and leave)

Same with the Schutzhütte, most don't allow you to spend the night there, but that's more for the protection of the owners so you can't sue them if you do it anyways and something happens. The worst that can happen here, too, is that they just send you away.

Germany elects governments too you know, and it wasn't THIS government or THIS party that first violated the Maastricht Criteria. Plus, of course, the fact that Germany had huge reunification problems, trillions of Euros it is said to have costed, is always ignored.

Nonetheless the German state bears responsibility in the end, so it is somewhat of a valid argument, even if Merkel never had anything to do with it.

However one must also look at the way the Maastricht Criteria were violated. Germany in 2003 implemented the now oh so famous big radical reforms and neither went on a spending spree nor failed to prevent the build-up of a financial bubble.

There's a point to the argument that Germany sent a bad/wrong signal then, but it's not like that makes Germany responsible for the shitty fiscal (or in some cases economic) policies of other countries.

3- sapendo che ormai la gggente ragiona in termini più economici che altruistici/idealistici (purtroppo...), l'unico modo efficace ed efficiente che attualmente riesco ad immaginare è l'incentivo alla **pubblica delazione dei comportamenti ""inappropriati""**.

Bene, ti denuncio in forma anonima (allegando ovviamente prove tipo un filmato fatto con lo smartphone, corredato di timestamp) e in cambio mi guadagno punti sulla patente, se non addirittura sconti sul bollo auto o altre gabelle connesse alla fattispecie all'origine della denuncia.

4- potrebbe essere deleteria sul piano teorico, ma non sul piano sostanziale: ricordati che il garantismo cieco (impostazione attuale del sistema giudiziario) non paga.

Children are given extensive sex education in schools. Mini-vibrators and condoms are sold at supermarket checkouts.

Salary gaps between men and women are some of the lowest in the world and the rate of female participation in the labour force is one of the highest. Just after Finland, and at the same time as Denmark, Iceland was one of the earliest countries to grant women the vote in 1915.

2) ""Both [homosexual and heterosexual] sets of parents reported relatively few serious problems and generally positive relationships with their children, with only a minority encouraging sex-types toys, activities, and playmates. Heterosexual parents made a greater effort to provide an opposite-sex role model for their children, but no other differences in their parenting behaviors were found. Gay and lesbian parents saw a number of benefits and relatively few problems for their children as a result of their homosexuality, with lesbians perceiving greater benefits than gay men. Conversely, the gay males reported greater satisfaction with their first child, fewer disagreements with their partners over discipline, and a greater tendency to encourage play with sex-typed toys than did the lesbians. The findings suggest that being homosexual is clearly compatible with effective parenting and is not a major issue in parents' relationships with their children."" *

3) ""Children raised by lesbian mothers or gay fathers did not systematically differ from other children on any of the outcomes.

Just go to San Marco square, and walk out of it, away from the center, and keep going until you find less tourists around you, and then keep walking a little bit more, Venice is small and really interesting to walk.  Then, just pick a random place and have a great meal.  

Honestly, you are just likely to get ripped off otherwise - and its just as likely the cuisine will be equally fine if not better than elsewhere, no one in Italy is really going to make bad food, such a sin its unthinkable.  If you are near the square or in a part of Venice that has little lights above the street/walkway or 'resturantours' trying to get you in, keep walking, even if the place is supposedly a good place.  Check the locations of those you listed, and maybe pick the one farthest from the square.

Prepare to pay a good amount at a place that takes reservations, and although there isn't tipping in Europe, you'll also likely be hit with a ""service"" charge or a bread charge, or both, even with a reservation at a ""fine"" eating establishment.  Likely the ""service"" will be perfunctory at best, or you'll experience some ignorant snobbery which is always (not) fun. I cannot over-emphasize how nice it is to duck into a random bar that serves food (these are very unlike American bars), you find locals that run the place like normal people - and not reliant on getting as many tourists in as possible.

Look, you are right and all of us understand how this works. But what's rather interesting about it is the question: Does it necessarily have to go like this? Countries are just another example of ""***Us vs them***"" teams. So, like most  such teams, they are imaginary to some degree, remnants of primate tribal instincts. Today, you can manipulate these instinct and apply them to all kinds of groupings they were never designed to apply to, from sports-teams to whatever ...  *us Americans vs them Mexicans*, *us white folks them blacks*, *us Christians vs them Muslims* etc etc etc ad nauseum. Then, as soon as you have created the teams, you start wanting to compete. You are compelled to do so at a very basic instinctive level.

I completely agree with this.

That is because personal purpose is so difficult to find. 

It's easier to have someone tell you your purpose is to operate this machine from 6 am to 2 pm five days a week for a certain, steady amount of money than being creative yourself. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with this kind of thinking - for an individual.

I just feel like our societies are wasting such an incredible potential by breaking all the things down to a monetary dimension.

Money doesn't make sadder or happier. Money doesn't help being creative and come up with radical ideas - en contraire. Money is holding us back - intellectually, socially, even technologically.

That is a good question that is easily answered: I don't see this as a purposeful activity, at least not as my main purpose in life right now.

But I think I know what you mean to say; it's not always clear which action might make sense or which might be a waste of time.

That's why I take the liberty to sometimes just do whatever the fuck I like and not worry about efficiency.

Alright.

What I wanted to communicate is that I'm not a big fan of discussing everything to the tiniest detail - not on reddit.

&gt; A McJob is considered ""employment"". But it is rather far removed from anything meaningful.

You mix up ""purpose"" for the person affected with ""meaning"" for anybody else but that person - maybe meaning for the society, maybe for yourself but as I understand it, according to your idea of meaningful. Generally, I don't think you can do this.

I know people who find happiness in detaching rubber seals for a few hours a day. Their work is probably not very meaningful to a computer scientist, they're definitely not detaching the seals fast enough to be efficient workers in the seal industry but their life obviously has a purpose.


Regarding your Einstein remark I'd like to mention the expression [""yak shaving"".](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) Reading diverse technical documentation can be useful and it probably helped Albert as well.

&gt; Employment and purposeful activity are not necessarily synonymous.

I agree. As I wrote, it's just semantics and as such subject to change. 

&gt; Look at what you are doing right now. Are you getting paid for discussing these things? So, why are you doing it then?

I felt this question was of a rhetorical nature.

&gt;
&gt; Carissimi,
&gt; vi scrivo perchè ho saputo che nik è stato confermato come videomaker per
&gt; uno dei nostri due gruppi parlamentari (camera o senato).
&gt;
&gt; non mi sono mai permessa in questi anni di scrivervi per
&gt; chiedere,segnalare o spiegare qualcosa,nonostante tutti i casini che
&gt; abbiamo affrontato in emilia romagna,bologna in particolare. ho sempre
&gt; pensato che i fatti contano molto più delle parole.
&gt;
&gt; oggi, però, non posso evitarlo.
&gt; io con nik ho sempre avuto un rapporto viscerale. il nostro errore,ma
&gt; anche la nostra forza, a bologna è stato quello di mischiare troppo la vita
&gt; privata e i rapporti umani con le scelte politiche.
&gt; fino a qualche anno fa io,nik,giovanni,serena,...eravamo come una
&gt; famiglia. fu giovanni ad insegnare a nik come fare video.
&gt; sapete bene quanto e come la situazione è degenerata col passare del tempo.
&gt;
&gt; personalmente, una delle cose più belle di questa nuova vita a roma, sta
&gt; nel fatto di aver finalmente cambiato aria.
&gt;
&gt; non essere più costretta a guardare ogni gg quanto le persone si facciano
&gt; del male l'una con l'altra..a colpi di comunicati stampa,dichiarazioni sui
&gt; giornali,post su fb,malelingue,falsità, Cattiveria...
&gt; è stato traumatico vivere tutto questo a bologna ed essere spettatrice dei
&gt; miei ""compagni di viaggio"" che con i loro comportamenti hanno ROVINATO un
&gt; intero gruppo.
&gt; sono tutti responsabili. io compresa.
&gt;
&gt; ci sono persone però che con le loro prese di posizione e gli attacchi
&gt; continui sono state responsabili più di altre.
&gt; nik è sicuramente una di queste persone.
&gt;
&gt; per 3 anni ha contestato ferocemente il fatto che giovanni mirasse solo al
&gt; parlamento.
&gt; ci sn stati episodi odiosi in questi tre anni. più volte si è rischiato di
&gt; arrivare alle mani in riunioni con minacce e colpi di testa.
&gt;
&gt; oggi nik viene chiamato per essere pagato da noi deputati e senatori per
&gt; lavorare in parlamento.
&gt; io non posso accettarlo. il suo carattere e le sue forti prese di
&gt; posizione in passato sono importanti per far capire che lui non può essere
&gt; adatto ad un compito del genere. ho il timore che non sia una persona
&gt; equilibrata e minerebbe sicuramente il gruppo parlamentare perchè credo che
&gt; molte dinamiche non verrebbero comprese.
&gt;
&gt; quando ho sottoscritto il nostro accordo per far decidere a voi i nostri
&gt; gruppi comunicazione ero felicissima perchè credo che sia determinante un
&gt; filo diretto tra noi e il blog,ma soprattutto è determinante avere persone
&gt; che ci aiutino e che abbiano dentro lo spirito del movimento.
&gt;
&gt; ci siamo ritrovati però al 20 marzo senza un gruppo comunicazione.
&gt; vito è solo al senato.
&gt; oggi è arrivato incerti e dal blog ieri avete lanciato i nomi di messora e
&gt; martinelli (che non hanno nemmeno compreso cosa devono fare,infatti
&gt; martinelli l'ha già dimostrato!).
&gt;
&gt; sto prendendo molto a cuore il ruolo che mi è stato affidato e mi sento in
&gt; dovere di segnalarvi le problematiche che ho vissutk in prima persona
&gt; lavorando con nik.
&gt;
&gt; capisco che per chi non conosce i fatti sia difficile comprendere questa
&gt; mia netta presa di posizione ma mi rendo disponibile per spiegare a tutti
&gt; le mie motivazioni e cosa è accaduto in passato.
&gt;  vi comunico iboltre che dirò tutto questo anche a nik domattina con una
&gt; telefonata.
&gt;
&gt; per qualsiasi chiarimento o anche solo per una chiacchierata il mio num è
&gt; 328 6192674.
&gt;
&gt; un abbraccio,
&gt; Giulia Sarti.

- Most Roma come from Eastern Europe so they can't be employed legally in some western countries until restrictions end

High minimum wage decreases the number of low-training jobs available and they are usually snapped up by other migrants. In Eastern Europe with &lt; 200E/month minimum wage one can employ a lot of people for menial jobs

However, the fact that they are employed in Romania doesn't mean they're doing well. Being 'working poor', having 3-4 kids on 700Ron a month is definitely not decent living.

The guy with the red tie (Lopez) is the representative of the TV channel that pays for the ""fiction"" they are shooting. 
The bearded guy is the Director (Renè), the girl is the actress (Fabiana) but also the director's daugher, even if this information has been kept secret to everyone else on the set, mainly to avoid everybody thinking she could have been given that role because of her father.

This scene has her arguing with the TV representative about how they should shoot a scene involving a cripple. She says the director always has to say the final words about how it should be done. She has a great opinion of her father and believes he's a passionate director with a strong work-ethic (the truth is Renè the director is quite mediocre, takes many compromises with the TV producers and always works ""alla cazzo di cane"" lit. dog's dick way aka: in a shitty way) 

The TV representative answers her that, since the TV pays, they are those that decide everything according to what the audience wants to watch and to what sponsors pay for. 

Her rant is so fierce that the old lady (Itala) immediately recognize her as the director's daugher (famous for his epic rants) thus revealing their relationship to everybody.

Hearing this info the TV representative cheers basically saying that he doesn't give a fuck anymore about what she said, she's Renè's daughter so that's just fine, it's Italy after all and nepotism rules rampant anywhere!

    ...


    Leggo di un mirabolante patto pd-lega....

    conosco i miei polli. oltre a ragioni di mera sopravvivenza per la lega e
    pd, sotto potrebbe esserci anche uno scambio comune... per autorilanciare
    la campagna buonisti vs xenofobi sulla 'cittadinanza agli immigrati' e
    cercare di mettere in difficoltà noi che su questo abbiamo un elettorato
    spaccato a metà - da una parte uno molto aperto, dall'altra quello ex lega
    e centrodestra piu' chiuso.

    In quel caso penso che la posizione migliore sia quella già espressa in
    passato  - e chi vi parla sostiene e ha firmato per la cittadinanza agli
    immigrati perchè lo sostengo come diritto e concetto ma non alla nascita in
    automatico - cosi sintetizzabile e già espressa da beppe alla fine delle
    polemiche.


    *sintesi tanto per iniziare il ragionamento (alla fine se parli con la
    gente la linea piu' ragionevole e che tiene conto di pro e contro e tutte
    le posizioni.*

    ECCO QUI LA RISPOSTINA DA TIRAR FUORI SE FANNO IL GIOCHINO -
    ----------------------------------

    *siamo favorevoli al diritto di cittadinanza per i figli di genitori
    stranieri che nascono qui, ma non in automatico alla nascita, ma legato ad
    un percorso d'integrazione scolastica dei bambini in italia. e' buonsenso
    civico.*
    *
    *
     del resto il programma del Movimento 5 stelle parla chiaro sin dal 2009 -
    *Insegnamento gratuito della lingua italiana per gli stranieri,
    obbligatorio in caso di richiesta di*
    *cittadinanza. *
    *
    *
    *questo perchè cittadinanza e intregrazione scolastica e linguistica vanno
    di pari passo*.

    *
    *
    *Diciamo di piu', la questione dal momento che siamo un paese di frontiera
    in forte crisi ed esiste la libera circolazione delle persone, con il
    trattato di schengen va affrontata con una linea comune europea. è una
    tematica da affrontare con tranquillità e serietà con tutti i governi
    dell'Unione Europea. senza fughe in avanti, senza xenofobia, senza
    buonismi. ma con estremo pragmatismo e buonsenso comune per il rispetto dei
    diritti umani di tutti. se c'è la libera circolazione delle persone è ora
    che ogni paese europeo faccia la sua parte nell'affrontare sia il tema
    immigrazione che quello integrazione con regole comuni decise insieme
     sentendo i cittadini.*
    *
    *
    *Se Pd e Lega vogliono giocare ad una vergognosa guerra degli opposti
    estremismi ideologici buonisti contro razzisti utile solo per i loro scopi
    elettorali, noi non ci stiamo. *
    *
    *
    *e' un giocare con il fuoco pericolosissimo che come risultato potrebbe dar
    fiato alle trombe razziste e nazifasciste in Europa. Il Pd se ne assume le
    responsabilità **?*
    *
    *
    *inoltre non ha senso l'automatismo alla nascita , immaginate un bimbo che
    nasce in italia, diventa italiano dopo 1 giorno, ma i suoi genitori dopo 1
    anno se ne vanno e lui ritorna in Italia dopo 25 anni senza neanche sapere
    la lingua e non aver mai vissuto nel nostro paese. Ha senso logico ? la
    cittadinanza per i bimbi di genitori stranieri che nascono qui,va acquisita
    alla fine di un percorso scolastico minimo , di crescita e integrazione
    come accade in altri paesi, naturalmente vengono garantiti ai bambini come
    a tutti come da Costituzione tutti i diritti essenziali anche prima.*

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    voglio vederli di fronte ad una posizione del genere... DI MERO BUONSENSO

&gt;&gt;         Non aggiungerci al loro stress.

&gt;&gt;         Il gruppo incoraggia e ringrazia...
&gt;&gt;         Boh.
&gt;&gt;         Io invece mi lamento. TiÃ¨ ;-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         Sinceramente speravo di avere maggiore coinvolgimento e
&gt;&gt;         informazione in questa fase.
&gt;&gt;         Quello che so lo leggo su Repubblica.... il che dice tutto.
&gt;&gt;         La gente chiede l'agenda e i vari passaggi e non so cosa
&gt;&gt;         rispondere.
&gt;&gt;         Ora che c'Ã¨ questa attenzione serve maggiore coinvolgimento.
&gt;&gt;         La gente ci segue. ADESSO. Vuole sapere i primi passi. E
&gt;&gt;         anche io.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         Una mail di saluti alla settimana Ã¨ troppo poco.
&gt;&gt;         Mi fa piacere che agli altri sia sufficiente. A me sembra poco.
&gt;&gt;         Spendere due minuti ogni 2/3 giorni prima di addormentarsi
&gt;&gt;         per fare un resoconto al gruppo che ha lavorato con questo
&gt;&gt;         impegno non mi sembra chiedere troppo.

&gt;&gt;             ciao a tutti!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             avevo detto che avrei scritto mail prima del grande
&gt;&gt;             giorno d'inizio x raccontarvi tutto quello che Ã¨ successo
&gt;&gt;             da domenica ad oggi ma sn stata davvero troppo impegnata.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             sono giornate durissime,io sto alla Camera dalla mattina
&gt;&gt;             alle 8 e la sera andiamo via con i commessi!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             questa matt iniz ufficialm alle 10.30 ma io devo esser li
&gt;&gt;             tra mezz'ora!!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             tra sab e domenica farÃ² un bel resoconto con notizie
&gt;&gt;             succose e gossip!!;)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             intanto vi dico che ieri Ã¨ passata una mia proposta in
&gt;&gt;             assemblea (prima di eleggere rob fico) e ho formato
&gt;&gt;             insieme ad alessandro di battista e altri neo deputati un
&gt;&gt;             altro gruppetto di lavoro oltre a quelli giÃ  presenti per
&gt;&gt;             fissare regole di coordinam delle ns assemblee e
&gt;&gt;             strutturare le dirette streaming che vorremmo far partire
&gt;&gt;             dalla prox settim.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             sentiamo tutti la mancanza del contatto con i ns gruppi
&gt;&gt;             locali e cittadini e abb pensato che la diretta streamjng
&gt;&gt;             (se regolata in maniera decente!) Ã¨ il modo migliore x
&gt;&gt;             rendervi partecipi delle ns assemblee!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             ci incontreremo domenica mattina cn il gruppo di lavoro
&gt;&gt;             proprio xkÃ¨ sent la forte urgenza di dare al piu presto
&gt;&gt;             feedback all'esterno sul ns lavoro qui!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             in ogni caso tra sab e dom sarÃ² piÃ¹ lubera x scrivervi tutto!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             girate questo mess agli attivi please!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             vi abbraccio forte e vi porto con me dentro l'aula! 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;              
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;             p.s. ho rifiutato di candidarmi x la presidenza della
&gt;&gt;             camera xkÃ¨ punto ad altro  e sarÃ² molto piÃ¹ utile al

    ...

&gt;Distrazione di massa, concordo, devono in qualche modo far credere che i bugaleaks fossero indispensabili per difendersi dai faviani. se dimostriamo che i faviani non esistono (lo stiamo facendo da quando Giò se n'è andato e NESSUNO DI NOI lo ha seguito), quelle mail li inchiodano alle loro responsabilità. Domanda: ma se io chiedo a Marco e max se la semestrale è un momento di confronto con la cittadinanza parlo di Fede e Giò?
Perchè parlare di ""sovranità dell'assemblea"" significa chiedersi ""le due ultime semestrali che valore hanno avuto?"". 
Continuo a sostenere che ste cose le dovremmo scrivere addirittura sul Meetup, manco più nel forum privato, dove si fa politica coi consiglieri. Il posto giusto per il fiato sul collo che gli stiamo facendo è la piazza virtuale aperta e trasparente del meetup.


&gt;Aiutiamoci come abbiamo fatto con lo status Facebook di Andrea a sostenere in rete le tesi che riteniamo veritiere, siamo influencer, rendiamocene conto. Loro il ruolo di influencer lo hanno imparato bene (vedi accenno a Favia e Salsi per insospettire Beppe e i grullini, e portare già le mani avanti per un'uscita elegante dalla riunione in caso li mettessimo in difficoltà... ""ve lo avevo detto!"" basta che dicano!). Non per niente l'articolo di oggi non ha la versione di Andrea, a far da contrappeso! Ha sicuramente chiesto lui di essere ripubblicato senza il contraddittorio, stavolta: chi legge Repubblica oggi e non l'ha letta ieri penserà alla corrente di Giò, ieri era molto più equilibrata e insinuante nei suoi confronti. Sapete che a pensar male si fa peccato, ma...

&gt;Quello cui tengo io è che le cose sian fatte per bene, senza cattiveria e nel modo più equo e liscio possibile.
Se serve un relatore è necessario conosca la storia dell'evoluzione del gruppo.Ad Andra gli mancano sei mesi, i più tribolati, a quanto pare... non so se è il più adatto.Cuppone o Michele li vedo adattissimi.Non me ne voglia Giampiero ma gli mancano un sacco di pezzi, a cui sta sopperendo egregiamente con giudizio, pazienza nell'ascoltare e precoce intuizione! :)Se serve anche la mia chiacchiera sono come sempre a disposizione: sapete che se son calmo e concentrato so essere un buon oratore...

This happens by messing with the reward system in the brain (dopamine and endorfines releases) people can easily get sucked into this and with time it rewires our hunter-gatherer brain to behaviors that are not good.


Recent studies even point to cancer but these are highly controversial and being hotly debated.

They only let a limited number of people up at one time, so there would be other people around, but not a lot. Plus, then someone could take photos for you afterwards. And chances are there would English-speakers up there with you, so you could even tip one of them off and have them take photos while you propose (if you're into that).

There is also a park near the Porta San Marco with a fantastic view of the countryside.

Then I remember how distant the EP is to its voters, and how the Commission is a joke in terms of democratic accountability, so I really don't know who's going to advance reforms. My money's still on the EP, but a reform can only be done through the mainstream parties. Those parties that are now staunchly anti-immigration are also anti-EU, and I wish to never see the day they rise up to power.

My country is not exactly an immigration hot spot (because it doesn't have much to offer), I think an insignificant amount of the populace is made up of foreigners - and most come from Europe anyway. However, I've studied, worked and lived elsewhere in the EU, and the further West you go, the more it seems like something has gone out of control. What I see is that many non-skilled immigrants generally don't end up feeling very ""European"", while the skilled ones are often attracted by the better prospects and often higher pay across the Atlantic. One of the most popular public figures in Romania is a Palestinian doctor who turned our emergency system into a highly trusted public institution - I want more people like him, here and elsewhere, and a ""Skilled Workers Welcome"" programme would always get my vote. Something needs to be done about how easily the others acquire residence and citizenship, save for humanitarian and family-reunification cases.

The US Federal government has very little power compared to what people think. Our Federal government has just about the minimal amount of power required for a country to remain existant.

In some areas, I think, the EU probably has more power than the US Federal government has over the states. For instance, the EU has the power to establish an anti-discrimination directive. The US Federal government, on the other hand, can only enforce such a statute on a US business if they conduct cross-state business. This covers most businesses, though.

Compared to the US, the EU is mostly just lacking a military and direct taxation capability. The talk about a fiscal union where the EU monitors member budgets is a bit odd to me, because the US Federal government doesn't have such power over the states. The US mostly controls the states by excluding funds from a state if they don't do something they want (for instance the minimum drinking age law excluded states from interstate highway funds).",0,1366847392,null,0,1366847916,0,c9m0skz,t3_1cwfxw,t1_c9m0skz,t1_c9kqkde,null,1431439461,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

So i went to look on the group's website she created last year: [Link](http://pourlhumanitedurable.com/Lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet)

And it explicitely says:

&gt;Aujourd’hui, le nouveau pouvoir a clairement marqué sa volonté de faire disparaître ces principes d’Humanité durable par les engagements programmatiques suivants du président de la République :

* n°21 : légalisation de l’euthanasie
* n°31 : légalisation du mariage et adoption d’enfants par les couples de même sexe
* n°46 : constitutionnalisation de la laïcité
* n°37, 39 et 40 des “40 engagements qui vont changer la vie des femmes” : promotion de la contraception anonyme pour mineurs ainsi que généralisation et gratuité totale de l’IVG

&gt;Soumis depuis des décennies à une influence médiatique univoque, les Français n’ont pas pris la mesure du bouleversement anthropologique historique qu’ils réaliseront pour notre pays et notre prochain dès la nouvelle Assemblée élue les 10 et 17 juin.

&gt;C’est pourquoi le Collectif pour l’Humanité Durable lance aujourd’hui son action dans le but déterminé d’empêcher l’adoption de ces lois.

Basically, it talks about different laws legalizing euthanasia, gay marriage, constitutionalization of Laicité, promotion of IVG, and then says that the group is against all of that.

So better modify that wiki ;)

You use quotes for 'bad' as if what I find bad isn't really bad. Slavery is bad, for example, which is what many job offers in our country are starting to be (without the physical punishment associated with slavery, though).


&gt;And the best tool for good wages and good labour standards is low unemployment so that it's harder for employers to find good workers at a low wage and so that it's easier for employees to find good work at a high wage.


You might argue that. Still, for that to happen, everyone would have to take up shitty, quasi-slavery jobs. Don't really feel like paying for the mistakes of previous generations.


&gt;What would it matter if the government restricted your choice and chose for you that that job wasn't sufficient and you couldn't accept it regardless of your own opinion?


I would wager that most the population don't want to be abused :)


If you open exceptions that will create (more) loop-holes in the legislation which in turn will allow more abuse by the employers.


Now, our country does have rather restrictive law regarding labour. This is both good and bad. Obviously it's good for the employee and bad for the employer. As with everything in life, a balance must always be achieved.


But even if the scales are not balanced, the labour laws aren't the biggest impediment to job creation in Portugal - all the extra taxes and bureaucracy are (well, that and lack of funding and innovative ideas).


No, I don't believe being (more) raped in the ass will solve our crisis or help unemployment or help anyone but greedy bosses (and you know very well that Portugal is full of wise-guys that try to take advantage of the system as best as they can).",0,1366857681,null,0,false,0,c9m4iyd,t3_1d0b4p,t1_c9m4iyd,t1_c9m1ih9,null,1431437631,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

For example lets take Greece, for decades people have cheated on their taxes, not asked receipts, and this wasn't because someone decided to do so. No! It was because nobody saw it important to make tax collection efficient and decrease corruption! Or lets take Cyprus, they have been enablers of tax evaders, tax frauds and hiding of criminally earned money.

EDIT: The Nordic welfare states are only possible because people and companies make money. That money is then taxed and used to provide all those wonderful services that make these societies work and function. However there is constant need to tweak and evolve, the states need to make sure that business environment stays good, that private investment happens, that there is needed workforce in right place, etc... And that money that is taxed is used efficiently, that there is as small amount of overhead as there can possibly be. Every time the state employes a worker that it doesn't really need, then there is either less money for the private sector to invest and grow, or less money to provide those services.

More importantly, the US suffered no war damage to its production capacity at all. None. Granted, the USSR moved its entire industrial capacity behind the Ural mountains after Operation Barbarossa.

When it comes to the free world the US was the only major economy that was completely intact when the war ended. Actually, the Marshall plan came into existence because the US could not find a large enough market for its production capacity. The cold war hegemony of the US was due to it being to only major economic most-war player in the free world.

Hence, claiming that the US not asking for war reparations is some kind of notable or exceptional decisions is presenting the facts the other way around. When the US entered the war it came out of [decades of isolation](http://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/AmericanIsolationism). The US economy - due to the Great Depression - was in tatters. The US left WW2 as the dominant power in the world. For example, it was able to impose the [Bretton Woods system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system) on the rest of the world. This system alone had an enormous geopolitical impact. The US was able to establish NATO. The US started the United Nations (which is the post-war years was de facto a US foreign policy agency.)

Hence, those *billions upon billions of dollars rebuilding Japan and Western Europe* were nothing at all compared to the unfathomable power of the post-war United States. ",0,1366872633,null,0,false,0,c9m8vzw,t3_1d2fkn,t1_c9m8vzw,t1_c9m8dcm,null,1431435575,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,mrmdc,null,null,"Man... Anywhere!

Anywhere is great. I'm sure she'll say yes regardless of where you do it.

But from your list, I offer these suggestions:  
-**Bari**: Bari Vecchia. There are hundreds of tiny marbled streets off of the main piazzas that wind up and down the old city. (don't listen to people saying it's dangerous... it's been cleaned up) Or you can do it along the water front. Bari has the longest ""boardwalk"" in Italy and second longest on earth (Nice has the longest). There are plenty of scenic spots (again near Bari Vecchia)

-**The Amalfi Coast**: I'm assuming that you will be taking a ferry, stopping in many places. These places may include, but might not be limited to: Ischia, Capri, Anacapri, Positano, Amalfi, Salerno.   
Ischia and Capri-Anacapri are beautiful islands. Literally ANYWHERE would be magical. In Capri there is the Grotta Azzurra. You take a tiny little boat with a guide into a cave near the coast. It would be hard to propose *in* the grotto. But it's beautiful as fuck. Otherwise... Like I said... Anywhere in Capri. Rent a scooter, explore.

-**Rome**: You could try the Trevi fountain early morning. It's pretty deserted. Otherwise the Circo Massimo is huge; it's a bit off from the main tourist sights, so it won't be crowded. Plus there's plenty of space and history surrounding you. Also the You can try the outdoor space near the Colosseo at night time.

-**Bologna**: Yeah.. There's plenty of stuff here... But not in the sense of romance. It's beautiful, don't get me wrong, it's full of history. But I can't think of any really *nice* places. Though you could do it at the main fountain, the name of which escapes me right now... I'm really nice and lit up at night.  **Update** Fountain of [Neptune](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/1054_-_Bologna_-_Fontana_del_Nettuno_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall%27Orto%2C_9-Feb-2008.jpg/280px-1054_-_Bologna_-_Fontana_del_Nettuno_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall%27Orto%2C_9-Feb-2008.jpg)

-**Genoa**: Here you have some options. There's lot of water nearby, lots of coastal niceties... I don't really remember though...

-**Siena**: Beautiful. The main piazza with the tower. That's a nice, historical place. Other places too... Near the big church... Again... I forget the name. It's a big piazza with a big, beautiful, striped church with large round windows in front...

-**Napoli**: Keep that ring as hidden as possible.

-**Palermo**: Same as Napoli 

-**Florence**: Literally anywhere. Any quiet spot you can find. It's all amazing. Possible Piazzale Michelangelo. It's atop a little hill. Nice view of the city. Not *too* many tourists. Mostly buses. It's a really nice spot.  Giardini Boboli too. It's big. Plenty of hidden romantic spots.

On the other hand, it is really not an easy procedure.

Then getting it prolonged for another two years costed us another €375. If I were Turkish, these fees would be €50 each.

A job route is even harder - after my recommendation one partner company tried to hire my friend from Serbia, but after about 6 months of hassle, their request was denied by IND on the basis that they didn't search hard enough inside the EU.

true,mars20,null,null,"My tips for Nuremberg and the surroundings:

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*[Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!
*In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.
*[Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.
*[Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 
*[Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing
*In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!
*Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

**Bamberg:**
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)
* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above
* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.bamberg-guide.de/bamberg/bierundbierkultur/kellerbilder/titelfoto-bearbeitet.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.
* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.
*Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recomment ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**
*[Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here
*[Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)
*Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see
*Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live, and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car.
*[Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremburg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle there and live there.
*[Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.
*The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.
*At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

true,[deleted],null,null,"I wouldn't say Europe is, but look at East Asia:

- North Korea doing its usual temper tantrums to get what it wants. This has worked in the past (threats for money or food) but its neighbours aren't rising to the bait. However NK a) has the potential to do a lot of damage and b) has a big brother that may or may not come to its aid (China). This is a little bit like Serbia pre-WW1. NK in of itself is not a great military threat, but might be the match that sets everything off.

- Japan and China arguing over the Senkaku islands (which is ultimately about control of dwindling natural resources both countries need). Here I'd compare China to Germany - big, rising industrial power - and Japan to France. Japan is also desperately trying to print itself out of its perma-recession - if this goes off the rails, will it revert to plain old nationalism and militarism?

- The US doing it's ""pivot"" to the Pacific. Actually this is in line with a decades-long trend interrupted by the whole post-9/11 thing. This may be a calming or disruptive influence - think of the Brits pre-WW1.

- Throw in some wild cards - South Korea, Russia and India, for example.

Of course it's a bit silly to draw direct analogies (""history doesn't repeat itself, but it sometimes rhymes""). But it looks like East Asia could be the next power keg. Then again, maybe not - China, Japan etc may have too much to lose. But that's what people thought before 1914 - we were too globalized and interconnected for a big war - if war comes, it would be over before Christmas (basically a re-run of the Franco-Prussian War a few decades before).

Regarding Europe, if there's going to be military conflict - *extremely* unlikely but not impossible - it will be internal - either as the result of a civil war due to internal separatism (UK, Spain), or things going very, very wrong due to a break up of the Eurozone (which is at this point more a question of when rather than if). Can't imagine modern Germany sending in the panzers if Greece defaults and leaves the Euro, but history can throw some very strange curveballs (best definition I've heard - ""history is the autobiography of a madman"").",0,1366875679,null,0,1366875999,0,c9m9en4,t3_1d1gwv,t1_c9m9en4,t1_c9m98b1,null,1431435331,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

I grew up in Czech Republic and left after finishing high school (class of 2006). Most of my friends went to university afterwards, but many of them sadly chose to study subjects that aren't very employable. Nevertheless, most of them do have jobs, though they seldom match their education level and only about 4 or 5 of them have full-time jobs. Ironically, the person who seems to be doing best never went to university and simply followed his passion of designing websites.

The numbers on the map look good for Czech Republic, but the reality of the situation doesn't look so rosy. Wages are so low that a lot of people in their 20s still live with parents, and jobs go mostly to those who have connections. The only exception seems to be technical fields - engineers and programmers.

It's still possible find old people in rural areas wearing their black berets, btw very traditional in the basque country. 
And for the folkloric costumes, is exactly that... folklore. It's only wore in traditional festivities or festivals. On the other hand, it doesn't exist anything as traditional spanish clothes, every region in Spain has their different traditions, culture, folkclore and even language.

As for the modern fashion, despite the crisis Spanish fashion chains are everywhere around Europe and also in other continents, I don't think that folklore clothes has significant influence in all this brands.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Even if we forget the obvious problem of how the unemployed should be able to pay bills (most economies are not strong enough to put everyone on welfare forever), there is a deeper psychological problem of feeling worthless, useless, and no direction in life. 

Two major reasons. 

One reason is urbanization. In rural areas where you have lots of cheap land you can figure out things to DIY without a job. Plant something, build something etc. But people living on the third floor in flats in urban areas can't really DIY much, they are used to a life where they work only in their jobs and not at home, and buy everything they need instead of making them. Rural people are huge DIYers and experts at living from a small income and making a lot of things for themselves, but urbanites not.

Another problem is motivation. There are some people internally motivated to be creative, but most are just lazy and would only do meaningful stuff if forced by lack of money, lack of comfort etc. I am one of them. I love the achievement felt by making something, but said achievement is not a strong enough motivation to do it. I need to be motivated by it being a job duty, or a significant money saver etc.

I must emphasize that it is not always and for everyone awesome to have lots of free time! It is perhaps awesome for the strongest driven people, and the laziest, who just play video games. But who are in the normal middle like myself, who want to be doing something meaningful, but unless forced I will just play video games then hate myself for it, it is very good to have external forced like the lack of money forcing me to do things, then I will feel satisfied and proud. Freedom is NOT always good! Freedom is good for the best people and the worst people, but not for the middle who want to be better but need someone else to kick their ass to be better. Like me.

I know this is very hard to understand. Many young people - and come accross as young - are huge believer in freedom. That's because you are either very motivated or very lazy. But for those in between, who want to be more motivated, who need external constraints to motivate them, free time is not so good. The older I get the less I believe in freedom in every sense. What we need is a _given_ place and direction in life, because we suck so much at finding it. It was so much easier back then when if your dad was a shoemaker you had to be a shoemaker too! There was none of these problems ""WTF should I do with my life, ah, I don't really want to work anything, but I need to if I want to feel some self respect"" etc. - you just did what you had to, it made you feel proud, and you did not have to deal with the necessity to choose.

If these two problems i.e. space and motivation by necessity (and paying bills) could be solved we could have a DIY &amp; creativity direction in life, not a job direction.

Which would be historically normal. Before 1820 or so very few people had jobs, they just worked in their own land, shop, workshop etc. jobs were made widespread by the industrial revolution. We had a DIY world before and could have again, maybe.

This is not an accurate way to describe the current policies of much of Europe, which are focused on austerity - or ""budget balancing"" - to a much worse extent than even the US.  It is also a bit odd to say that these policies are paying dividends when much of the continent is in economic crisis, with huge portions of the population permanently unemployed.

Yes, it is better to invest in health care and education than in war - that is what I think, too - but Europe today isn't some kind of utopia.  The US, with its moderate economic stimulus, is taking a better approach than Europe on that issue recently, or at least it was until the sequester.  If it weren't for the Republicans, the US economy would likely be adding far more jobs and improving the general welfare of its people more than European states.  Japan might be the best model right now, as it has completely rejected austerity.

Also, perhaps the reason that the only threats they face are ""goat herders"" is because of NATO.  You might be mocking the US for creating the very situation that you are praising.  With the presence of a US military shield, Europe has been free for many decades to devote substantial resources to social programs, and NATO might well have been the deterrent that created Europe's current peaceful and safe situation.",0,1366878569,null,0,1366879951,0,c9m9t45,t3_1d1gwv,t1_c9m9t45,t1_c9m8550,null,1431435071,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

If the US won't build one for Europe, Europe will have to build its own.  If the idea of a missile defense system appeals to European states, they're going to have to start investing in it.

What if nations begin to weaponize space - will Europe be able to defend its satellites and the space above itself?

What about the UN and peacekeeping missions?  Is Europe going to let other nations bear all the responsibility for them? 

What about internal problems, like another bloody conflict in the Balkans?  As I recall, Europe couldn't handle the last one without the US.  

What about projections of force around the world?  Libya, while not a necessary intervention, was something that Britain and France chose to engage, and they couldn't do it without America.  If EU states want to involve themselves in ventures like Libya in the future, perhaps in a place like Syria, they're going to need to invest more in their militaries.

What about cyber warfare?  That is a real threat.  And who knows what new threats might arise in the future from things like nanotech and drones.

Does Europe really want to rely on a nuclear deterrent?  Meaning: Would European states really nuke Russia if a future Russia became overly aggressive?  Nuclear war is perhaps the worst thing that could happen.  It is better not to set things up so that nuclear war is your only option other than acquiescence.  This is especially true as missile defense technology advances.

Military investments aren't just about bombing Afghanistan.  I don't think Europe should raise military spending to American levels, or anywhere near that, but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't invest more into military spending.  Isn't Germany essentially disarmed at this point, except for a small self-defense force?

Back in the 1950's conservatives opposed legalizing porn because it makes sex an animalistic thing, a pure b bodily ""mating"", without all the humanizing additions like courtship, love, marriage. Porn is basically how dogs have sex, meet, sniff and fuck, not people, it takes all the cultural stuff around it away. 

Liberals (short-term for sexual revoluioners, progressives, leftists, sex-positive feminists etc.) went nope, sex is just meaningless fun, like drinking a glass of water when you are thirsty, no big deal. (The glass of water parallel is a direct quote from Robert Merle's Derrière la vitre, I am not making this up.) 

A few decades later the very same liberal-progressive movement, now arriving at the second or third wave of feminism, realizes that porn is objectifying. Basically they reinvented the same argument as the animalistic argument of the conservatives of the 1950's because objectification means nothing else but how a predatory animal views its prey. Objectification is obviously an animalistic thing.

It's the same history moving in circles thing as how back in the 1950's sexual progressives wanted to abolish marriage because it is an oppressive bourgeois patriarchical institution and now the same kind of people think marriage is such an awesome thing that even gays should be able to marry.

* BR hat über etwas berichtet, dass nicht mit dem Standpunkt der GWUP übereinstimmt. Folglich muss das BR wohl demnächst auch über andere offensichtlich haarsträubende Dinge berichten.
* Die tatsächlich stattgefundene Diskussion über die Berner Studie in der Medizin wird kollektiv mit dem Beitrag eines GWUP-nahen Wissenschaftlers plattgebügelt. Auf den Umstand, daß es sich bei selbigem um einen Mathematiker, nicht etwa um einen Mediziner handelt, wird nicht hingewiesen. Ähnliche Strukturen finden sich bei amerikanischen Anti-Schwulen-Aktivisten, die nicht darauf hinweisen, daß sie ihren Doktor nicht etwa in Medizin, sondern in Englischer Literatur erhalten haben.
* Der Protest gegen einen angeblichen ""polemischen Kampfbegriff"" (""Schulmedizin"") in einem Artikel, der nur so von polemischen Kampfbegriffen trieft. Die negative Konnotation wird nicht etwa aus Duden oder Wikipedia hergeleitet, sondern aus einem ""Sprachlog"".
* Auch die weiteren Quellen sind nicht etwa wissenschaftliche Fachliteratur, sondern Blogs von ebenfalls geprägten Homöopathiegegnern. Kritische Reflektion findet nicht statt.
* *""Der Plural von “Anekdote” ist nicht “Daten”, und wer behauptet, mit Homöopathie Krebs zu heilen, verkauft bestenfalls leere, da wissenschaftlich ungestützte, Hoffnungen, und hat schlimmstenfalls Blut an den Händen.”* - Paradebeispiel eines Strohmann-Arguments. Homöopathie ist eben nicht nur onkologische Behandlung, in manchen Teilbereichen (etwa Erkältungen) mag es durchaus sinnvoll sein, homöopathische Mittel zu nehmen anstatt der Chemiekeule (weil erfahrungsgemäß keines der Optionen Homöopathie, nichts tun oder Chemie für einen kürzeren Krankheitsverlauf sorgt, aber der Patient zumindest das Gefühl hat, etwas genommen zu haben).
* Es wird falsche Weltoffenheit simuliert, indem zunächst ein (übrigens ziemlich peinliches - wenn man das verwandte Ghandi-Zitat kennt) Zitat eines Deutschen auf Englisch erwähnt, nur um es dann sofort zu übersetzen. 
* Zum Abschluß: *""Wer an Homöopathie glaubt, kann kein übersinnliches Phänomen, keinen faulen Zauber, kein rhetorisches Blendwerk und keine Verschwörungstheorie argumentativ entkräften, weil er nicht sagen kann, warum die Homöopathie glaubwürdiger sein soll als jene Behauptungen.“* - Mit Verlaub, das ist Blödsinn.

Early on because of a favorable climate and trade opportunities the south had a developmental advantage to the north.

 However a relatively unspecialised economy, new trade routes to the western indies and a geological potential, rich in coal and iron will fuel the development of the Nord to record heights, then the modern era of travel and easy trade, a couple of wars and dictatorships patched up the southern economises so the gap is less noticeable, but at its core, I don't think the GDP structure of southern stated is a healthy one, luxury items, construction, subsidised agriculture and tourism are not stable sources of income.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Slavery is bad, for example, which is what many job offers in our country are starting to be (without the physical punishment associated with slavery, though).

It's not slavery if you can refuse it.

&gt;Still, for that to happen, everyone would have to take up shitty, quasi-slavery jobs.

Or not, as those jobs would be pushed away as more and more people became employed and improved their living standards. Our labour laws are far more restrictive than those in the UK or the USA and yet we are the ones with the lowest paying jobs.

&gt;Don't really feel like paying for the mistakes of previous generations.

Me neither, that's why I'm seriously considering migrating. Still, those who remain here and continue to go down this path of restricting the labour market, it will be no surprise that unemployment will continue to rise.. sure, there are plenty other factors that come into the picture, but this one is a very serious one.

&gt;I would wager that most the population don't want to be abused :)

I also wager that, but between letting people choose for themselves what they want or the government saying ""no, you can't accept that"", I'd rather be free to choose and take responsibility for my actions.

&gt;If you open exceptions that will create (more) loop-holes in the legislation which in turn will allow more abuse by the employers.

I'd slash labour legislation and not only. One should be free to work for whomever he wants however he wants and also should be free to start his own business whatever it might be. And this right now is really difficult because of all the bureaucracy and regulation and permits one must acquire to actually run a business.

&gt;Now, our country does have rather restrictive law regarding labour. This is both good and bad. Obviously it's good for the employee and bad for the employer.

Nonsense, above everything, it's bad for the employee and (even worse) for the unemployed.

It's indifferent for an employers to pay higher than the minimum wage for a skilled worker, the one who's worse off is the unskilled one that's out of a job. It's indifferent for an employer to pay for the worker's vacations out of the worker's wage, the worker is the one that's paying for it even if he doesn't want the vacation time. It's indifferent for an employer to pay for the sickness leave of its workers, they are the ones who are paying for it with their own wages and also the unemployed which could be employed but aren't because the employer is using that money to pay for special benefits when he could be hiring more people.

&gt;As with everything in life, a balance must always be achieved.

What must be achieved is not restricting people's freedoms, if they want to do whatever they want, let them, they're not stupid and they don't need to be taken care off. The balance that must be achieved is the best life quality possible and that's achieved with the highest wages and the lowest unemployment, and for that, restricting the labour market is acting against your own interests.

&gt;But even if the scales are not balanced, the labour laws aren't the biggest impediment to job creation in Portugal - all the extra taxes and bureaucracy are (well, that and lack of funding and innovative ideas).

Yup, that's why you need to tackle all the issues and not only this one.

&gt;No, I don't believe being (more) raped in the ass will solve our crisis or help unemployment or help anyone but greedy bosses (and you know very well that Portugal is full of wise-guys that try to take advantage of the system as best as they can).

Knock it off with the word greedy, everybody's greedy, nobody's selfless like that.

Anyway, if you want employers to treat their employees fine, you must make them compete against one another, and that's just not going to happen with such a large pool of unemployed people.

Remove restrictions in both labour laws and in creating a business and let everyone freely work for whomever he wants or let them be the ones starting their own job - that's the one way you'll fix our labour market, reduce unemployment and improve both the wages of the workers and the productivity of the companies - it certainly won't happen with all these laws and regulations that are pulling us down.",0,1366883370,null,0,false,0,c9mads1,t3_1d0b4p,t1_c9mads1,t1_c9m4iyd,null,1431434800,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I honestly think you can be worried about living in a society where many kids came out of the woman that did not raise them afterwards, and not be a ""religious zealot"". Once again, everytime someone wants to live according to principles other than ""love is everything, the individual is everything, who cares about what our society is becoming"", they're called *-phobic, bigots, close-minded, etc.

And why not? This should not in any way be controversial. Knowledge was lost ... the burning of the library at Alexandria etc. This was undoubtedly worsened when extremely fanatical religions gained  influence in many regions. 

As recently as 2001 we saw that Muslims would dynamite the Buddhas of Bamiyan.  Early on, Christian fanatics were not any better, not to say worse. With some (mostly Muslim for a while) exceptions, superstitious and ignorant Muslims and Christians would destroy anything that was not ""*Godly*"". Why do you think that so many ancient statues are defaced, missing noses, arms, legs etc. They were destroyed on purpose. Is there any question in your mind about this? 

As for the technology part, a pretty convincing indication of this is the Ancient Greek [Antikythera mechanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) for example. 

It took about a millennium for similar, though less advanced, technology (clocks) to arise again.  Prof. Edmunds, leader of the 2006 analysis of the mechanism, said: ""*The design is beautiful, the astronomy is exactly right. The way the mechanics are designed just makes your jaw drop. Whoever has done this has done it extremely carefully ... in terms of historic and scarcity value, I have to regard this mechanism as being more valuable than the Mona Lisa.*""

There are texts that mention even more impressive technological feats, moving automatons, steam engines etc. And the way the Antikythera_mechanism was built indicates that these things were mass-produced. But we've only found one (and by complete chance).  The most likely explanation for its rarity is that, like most Hellenistic objects, machines, statues and temples, these types of things were systematically destroyed by people who did not understand them and feared them as *ungodly magical devil stuff*.

No, it's because the state is more involved in collecting the taxes big companies own.

A country where people don't have money to buy your products is NOT a good business environment.

You do make excellent points. But we all know the way our system functions and that work can be translated into money and money into work etc. 

But it still makes no sense. Oh, I also know that ""free time"" is a strange thing and that as soon as many people have a minute of it, they are almost desperately anxious to fill it with any possible activity or distraction. And here are indeed many similar ""psychological"" aspect to this. And there are indeed many problems to resolve. **But we must at least not forget that this needs to be resolved**.

He hates Jews _so much_ that he had been performing with an ostensibly Jewish comedian as a duet for about a decade. 

He began to be accused of being an antisemite not after making jokes about Jews (he used to pan Christians, Muslims and Jews equally; he's an atheist), but when he ridiculed Israeli settler. The sketch was performed on a show hosted by a Jew (Marc-Olivier Fogiel) who initially found it very amusing. But then Israeli interests (Bernard-Henry Levy, Finkielkraut and the likes) began to agitate accusations of antisemitism. 

Dieudonne didn't take that shit laying down. He fought back hyperbolically as well as heroically.

It really comes down to the debate about from where rights arise. Liberals hold that rights are logical constructs that are obviously correct. To be curtailed by the state only to the degree needed to in order to form society.

Conservatives hold that rights are privileges that the franchised decide all deserve. This position is increasingly more popular in modern democracies in which everyone is franchised.

true,gengisWorseThanAdolf,S972,Martinique,"Je viens de la Martinique, je vais donc essayer de répondre à tes questions concernant cette ile ;

&gt;Est-ce difficile/facile trouver de boulot? 

Je pense qu'il est plus sage de sonder un peu le marché du travail dans vos secteurs respectifs, sachant que cela reste une ile de 450 000 habitants seulement. 

&gt;Pourrais je trouver un boulot dans le tourisme facilement en sachant 3 langues couramment mais sans expérience dans le domaine?

L'industrie du tourisme a un peu de mal à répondre aux offres low-cost des iles voisines (cela a peut être changé depuis mon départ) ; je ne pense pas que trouver un bon boulot dans ce secteur sans expérience sois facile.

&gt; selon les infos que j'ai lu il y en a beaucoup de racisme anti-blanc. C'est vrai ou exagéré? 

Je suis métissé mais j'ai la peau très blanche. J'ai déjà reçu des insultes racistes, des remarques, etc... mais rien d’insurmontable.

 A mon avis ce n'est pas pire que dans les autres départements, et bien souvent cela émane de jeunes vivant dans la pauvreté (mélange d'ignorance et de jalousie).   

&gt;Le crime c'est apparemment plus élevé qu’en France.

Une partie importante des jeunes resté sur l'ile est victime de chômage, et en effet le taux de criminalité est un peu élevé (mais beaucoup moins que pour les iles proches, dont la Guadeloupe).

Il faut juste savoir où ne pas aller (surtout la nuit). J'y ai vécu de ma naissance à mes 18 ans, et je n'ai pas une seule fois été (sérieusement) agressé physiquement. 

&gt;Le cout de vie? trop élevé? 

Oui, le cout de la vie est élevé par rapport à la France hexagonale, cela est dû bien sûr aux cout d'importation des marchandises, mais aussi de quasi monopoles de certaines familles ""békés"" (descendants de colons) qui possèdent énormément de supermarchés mais aussi d'entreprises d'import / export. 

Mais en contrepartie, la cuisine martiniquaise (et antillaise en général) c'est une expérience à ne pas rater. Pouvoir acheter des produits locaux spécifiques est un avantage certain !

Le plus important selon moi est de se plonger dans la culture locale et d'oublier tous les a-aprioris qu'on peut avoir. La Martinique, ce n'est pas une ile paradisiaque, figée dans le temps, mais bien un pays unique (c'est à dire un territoire culturellement différent des autres régions de France) où la plupart des habitants sont fiers d'être martiniquais **et** français. 

La langue créole a une place importante, et c'est un atout important pour réussir une bonne intégration. Aller vers l'autre, être humble et avoir l'envie d'apprendre sont indispensable selon moi.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt;  Socialismo, or even a tamed version of capitalism, ALSO prevents people from dying. Just stop with the hyper-neoliberal bullshit.

Saying that money is important is not neoliberal bullshit, it is a fact of life, recognizing that we live in a finite world where we need to be careful on what we do and where put out resources.

&gt;  Again, keep on blaming/punishing the guy that evades 40€ on his tax, while those that avoid millions by putting their money offshore are untouched.

Both the guy that evaded 40€ and the one who evaded millions where both enabled by the Greek state! If people would really have cared about tax evasion, they would have elected people into parliament who would have made it their priority to cut down corruption, cut down tax loops, cut down tax evasion. What you don't seem to get is that tax evasion and corruption don't just happen, they are enabled by indifference. In this case indifference to make state efficient and functional.

&gt; No, it's because the state is more involved in collecting the taxes big companies own.

No. More taxes are gathered from income and consumption taxes than from corporate and capital gains taxes. Not to mention that you missed the whole point. The Finnish GDP per capita (nominal) in 2012 was 46,098 USD while in Greece it was 22,055. Well, what does that mean? It means that there is more money to pay all expenses. If the Greeks would try to run a similar welfare state like Finland, they would go bankrupt because there would not be enough money left to invest after huge taxes caused by running all services and benefits. The thing is, if you want to offer more services and benefits, what you need to do is to increase the total amount of money generated by the economy, the more there is, the more there is to share.

&gt; A country where people don't have money to buy your products is NOT a good business environment.

We live in a global world. There are fast growing markets in the developing world.

&gt; As long as there is money to be made, someone will invest.

If putting up a new business or a new factory is too risky, then that investment won't happen, but instead either those monies will used for consumption or they won't go less riskier assets, for example property.

&gt; True, but once again, the guy dying from hunger in the street is not the one responsible for the decisions of some fat cat.

But some sugars do replenish energy, so if you serve sugar to your kids they can play for longer before they get burned out, missing their normal bedtime. Candy also often goes with coffeine drinks that also gives energy and makes it hard to sleep.

Sugar also releases edorphines that makes people feel well, so kids will start being more happy, be more loose and run around more. Many kids are also addicted to sugar, so they will get excited when within reach of their next fix. 

Corn syrup that is more popular in the US also gives more energy than most other sugars.

Is modern society so overburdened with unnecessary jobs that they can only be sustained in positive economic conditions?

Wanted to finish with a relevant passage from Bertrand Russel who approaches the issue from the opposite side : 

&gt;Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness.

true,reefab,IDF,Ile-de-France,"&gt; Some people were afraid of the proliferation of surrogacy (GPA) for example and they thought gay marriage would lead to such a proliferation. 

People thinking that are idiots, not because of their opinion on the subject but because GPA has NEVER been on the table for any kind of couples.

&gt; I honestly think you can be worried about living in a society where many kids came out of the woman that did not raise them afterwards

Single dads everywhere would probably say otherwise. And again GPA has never been even considered.

&gt; Imagine a study shows that children CAN be raised perfectly by single parents or same-sex parents, but they are way more challenged in their life and more prone to having problems in their life afterwards. While I would still be in favor of gay marriage (and gay adoption), would you still call the opponents ""stupid"" ?

Let me change a few words there: ""Imagine a study shows that children CAN be raised perfectly by *mixed-race* parents, but they are way more challenged in their life and more prone to having problems in their life afterwards[...], would you still call the opponents ""stupid"" [for preventing them to have childrens]?""

I wouldn't call them stupid, but much much worse words.

&gt; MrNiarf spoke honestly and got downvoted

He didn't explain anything. As far as we know he could be just all ""gays are icky"" and that's it. Throwing a few controversial statements without backing them up is not contributing to a conversation.

I see where you are coming from, I also thinks that there have been too much mockery and finger pointing towards the ""anti-gay"" movement and that it's one of the reason they are so virulent. 
On the other hand, they and their proponents wielded intellectual dishonesty like a weapon and should not wonder if they didn't think they've been taken seriously.

It's also fine to have opinions on the subject but it's another thing to restrict the rights of a segment of the population because of your opinions.

Don't like gay-marriage? Don't marry a person of the same sex then.

Don't like gay-adoption? Don't adopt a child if you are in a same sex couple.

Don't like PMA? Don't use it.

Don't like GPA? WELL IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE IT ANYWAY.

Sure, you're going to tell me that gay-adoption changes nothing in the life of others ; yet you didn't really answer my point about ""children not knowing where they come from"". You talk about single dads : sure they exist ; sometimes the child never knew their mother, and it's really sad. Sometimes the child simply doesn't live with their mother, and it's no big deal and should happen more (I'm also an opponent of giving kids to mothers only in a divorce). But what do we tell to people who want to prevent society from becoming filled with children who are disturbed because the womb they come from did not raise them ? You say we're not talking about GPA here ; but as many gay people marry, there will be an increase in their need for children, and since they can't have them naturally, what will they do ? Adopt them from abroads ? It's long and tedious as hell, and there are not an infinite number of children to adopt. BTW, do we want an explosion of children adopted from abroads ? We know it's ALWAYS difficult, and can lead to behaviour problems. So that's another point opponents could be worried about.

Die Seite die Du da anführst finde ich aus zwei Gründen (zumindest für Deutschland, siehe zweiter Punkt) nicht so überzeugend:

* die angegebenen Fälle sind furchtbar und die ""Heiler"" haben sicherlich oft ihre Pflicht verletzt. Allerdings bin ich mir sicher, dass es ohne weiteres möglich ist, eine solche Liste über zugelassene Ärzte zu erstellen. Es gab vor gar nicht langer Zeit eine Studie, die ich jetzt leider nicht finde, in der gesagt wird dass Patienten die sonntags ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert werden, eine deutlich höhere Sterberate haben, weil sonntags nicht genug Ärzte für eine ausführliche Diagnose da sind. Hier ist wahllos eine andere Studie, die ich gerade gefunden habe: http://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/diagnose/krankenhaus-zehntausend-patienten-sterben-unnoetig-an-blutvergiftung-a-863850.html. 

Womit ich gewiß nicht sagen will, das Heilpraktiker besser sind, aber ich glaube nicht unbedingt, dass sie soviel *schlechter* sind und mehr Menschen auf dem Gewissen haben als Ärzte. Da möchte ich mal Fakten und Vergleichsstudien sehen, und nicht so eine Seite die sich die Rosinen rauspickt. Wie gesagt, man kann genau so eine Seite mit ärztlichen, tödlichen ""Kunstfehlern"" erstellen.

* in Deutschland gibt es ein sehr strenges [Heilpraktikergesetz](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilpraktikergesetz), welches dafür sorgt, dass Heilpraktiker sehr genau wissen müssen, wie man Krankheiten diagnostiziert und wie man seine Kompetenzen von denen von Ärzten abzugrenzen hat. Die Prüfung die man ablegen muss um Heilpraktiker zu werden besteht fast ausschließlich (bis auf möglicherweise einen kleinen Teil der mündlichen Prüfung) aus knallhartem medizinischen Wissen. Nicht auf Staatsexamenslevel, aber doch so haarig, dass die Durchfallquote dieser Prüfung regelmäßig bei bis zu 90% liegt (Stand von vor 10 Jahren, keine Ahnung wie es heute aussieht). Jeder Heilpraktiker muss wissen, wie man bei Bauchschmerzen eine Blinddarmentzündung ausschließt. Natürlich gibt es sicherlich auch immer wieder in Deutschland Fälle, wo einer das nicht weiß und die Folgen fatal sind, aber ich würde sagen die Chance ist doch deutlich geringer, als wenn irgendein selbsternannter Heiler ohne Titel diese Diagnose vornehmen würde. Und das wäre doch die Alternative, wenn es Heilpraktiker nicht gäbe: Viel mehr von den noch gefährlicheren Spinnern auf Deiner Webseite. Mal ganz abgesehen davon sind es auch die Patienten selber, die verantwortungslos und blind mit ihrer eigenen Gesundheit umgehen, man kann nicht alles auf die Mediziner abschieben, welcher Coleur auch immer. Die Dummheit der Menschen ist nicht zu unterschätzen, wie es auch auf der von Dir genannten Webseite eindrücklich deutlich wird.

Was die Krankenkassen betrifft: Hast Du dazu Fakten? Soweit ich weiß gibt es diverse Studien wo Krankenkassen lieber das alternative Zeug bezahlen, weil es im Vergleich billiger kommt. Vieles in der Medizin, mindestens solange es um Wehwehchen geht, beruht (edit: meiner Meinung nach!) auf Placebo, und Heilpraktiker sind deutlich besser darin, den Placeboeffekt auszunutzen, was tatsächlich dazu führen kann dass es dem Patienten besser geht. Leider habe ich dazu jetzt selber keine Links und keine Lust mehr, weil das viel zu lange gedauert hat, das alles zu schreiben.

In some economic systems, you have parachutes, it's not that money doesn't matter then, but it prevents you from dying because you don't have money for food.

&gt; Both the guy that evaded 40€ and the one who evaded millions where both enabled by the Greek state! If people would really have cared about tax evasion, they would have elected people into parliament who would have made it their priority to cut down corruption

Yeah, like elections in Egypt did do a lot to change the regime...

&gt; What you don't seem to get is that tax evasion and corruption don't just happen, they are enabled by indifference.

It's part of the neoliberal form of capitalism, sustained by bipartidism. Not because of indifference. 

&gt;  If the Greeks would try to run a similar welfare state like Finland, they would go bankrupt because there would not be enough money left to invest after huge taxes caused by running all services and benefits.

That's ones again capitalism. Bringing down wages is **not** a stimulus for a strong economy, it's a drain. Untamed capitalism is incompatible with a wellfare-state. Hence, there's more bureaucracy in Finland, than there is in Greece. You might not notice it in Finland, because it's a better streamlined version.

&gt; We live in a global world. There are fast growing markets in the developing world.

Fast growing GDPs. You can drown in a pool that is on average a few mm deep.

&gt; If putting up a new business or a new factory is too risky, then that investment won't happen.

Yes and no. It depends on the ROI in relation with risk. A shrinking economy is bad, a booming one, even an unstable one, is a good investment.

&gt; You live in democracy and have free speech and freedom of organization.

When you don't move, you don't hear the sound of your chains. We live in the illusion of democracy, the same way that you have the illusion of security because of the TSA.

&gt; And then you get inflation that you have to fight one day by increasing taxes

Says who? The neo-liberals? Those that are so in favour for private companies, of which the outstanding debts are generally 2/3 of the capital?

Je ne trouve sur le net que la première séquence : [Maryflo - 1997](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6W-dvRIiCM).

Ils disent aussi (les producteurs) que la perception dépend des spectateurs : là où toi tu peux par exemple trouver un personnage ridicule ou stupide, d'autres vont se reconnaître en lui et trouver que c'est un portrait flatteur. Et donc, tout le monde s'y retrouve, mais pas dans les mêmes personnages.

En y réfléchissant, je repensais à cette séquence sur le bourgmestre de Bruxelles qui se torchait soigneusement la gueule: moi je ne bois pas, et donc j'en ai une vision plutôt négative, mais quelqu'un qui aime picoler doit plutôt penser ""il est des nôtres, au moins c'est un bon vivant"", et le voir de manière positive.

De la même manière, même si j'ai de la compassion pour lui, je trouve le laveur de vitres qui se met à l'informatique un peu stupide/ridicule, mais je suis persuadé que quantité de gens qui ne maîtrisent pas du tout l'informatique et en souffrent doivent éprouver de l'empathie pour lui, genre ""oui, c'est vrai, les hotlines, on poireaute des heures, on se prend la tête avec un technicien qui ne comprend rien et à la fin on n'a toujours pas la solution"".

The strategy behind the ""BLITZ KRIEG"".  We did the same thing in the first gulf war.  Our tanks (M-1 Abrams) were actually too fast.  We had a hard time keeping up the logistics to support them (Fuel, Ammo, Maintenance, food/water).

As for light recon missions, in training/peace time yes often they use light ""civilian"" vehicles, and may also do the same in war time as to not draw as much attention to themselves.  However, that is not the only resource.  The Germany army has several, light armored fast vehicles that are used for reconnaissance, and most are multipurposed.

The cost of hiring an average European is simply too high in the world market now that globalization has begun, when the billions of Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Nigerian become a middle class comparable to European standards, then wages for Europeans will stop falling. 

Factory workers come to mind, Janitors, Cashiers etc. It is cheaper to import them for 5 years from wherever and send them back (for example). Europe has decided to subsidize the lifestyle of the people doing these jobs for the sake of economic equality (which is not necessarily bad, if that's what the society wants), unfortunately, Europe can no longer afford to keep doing so.

If median wages go down 25%. Employment will stabilize. (I'm not saying this is realistic or the right choice for the governments since such a drastic change in policy is bad for everyone, but by having stagnant wages for the next decade, the same thing will occur)

Since a productive economy derives value from so many things that belong equally to everyone (for example the radio spectrum and gravity), a fair economy should be structured to provide jobs for 95% of the people that want to work.  (You need some unemployment to allow reallocation of labor resources.)

It really makes no difference whether the jobs are productive.  Many highly paid jobs extract money from the economy, but are of dubious value to the economy.  For example, the people who administer high frequency trading.  (I know that you will claim that HFT provides liquidity but that is a somewhat dubious claim.)
