It depends. People protest about things all the time.

I'm very aware of the possibility of mob rule. I have two counter-arguments: First, we already have a judiciary that is entrusted with protecting human rights. We don't need to give that up and just make everything subject to majority rule. Second, if people were more involved in the decision-making process, then they would become more educated about the consequences of each action. With the current system, a populist politician can promise impossible things and most people won't scrutinise it because they delegate the decision to him, they will be none the wiser about the lies. Whereas if they actually had to make the decision themselves, they'd be forced to learn how things actually work. 

&gt;  more aristocratic systems are working on a more private property basis, the not your fucking business basis. For example the reason monarchies were, still are, inheriting the throne that the right to rule itself was a kind of a private property like a grandpa clock.

&gt; This may be too extreme now, and I am not advocating this, but limited government combined with more aristocratic structures would not make them more dictatorial.

I'm not sure what you're referring to with intellectuals having a terrible track record. As for the business class ruling, isn't this what we already have and is dysfunctional? We have a business class, the bourgeoisie, closely intertwined with the old power structures of the states. It's this combination that has been ruling for at least the past century or so.

That is a noble idea, yes. If you could have a culture that prized economic activity that is in line with fulfilling social welfare, it would be perfect. The thing is this is totally opposed by the mainstream narrative of the business class whose world-view is stuck in the ""Wealth of Nations""-derived belief that selfishness always serves social welfare. 

&gt; This has to be done anyway. No matter what group of people grabs the steering wheel, someone, somewhere has to browbeat them into taking it seriously and not selfishly.

Usually I would agree with this kind of reasoning, when we're dealing with real 'conspiracies' that involve mass murder, 9/11, faking the moon landing or false-flag attacks or things like that, but in this case it just concerns data collection and monitoring. Everyone who is involved is just doing their job, and part of their job is to keep silent. Why would they speak out when they truly believe that they are helping keep the country safe?

This is also why I think it is both just the tip of the iceberg, and exaggerated. I'm sure we will learn more in the future about an even further extent of surveillance, and I find it very worrisome, but it is still exaggerated when people compare it to *1984* because ultimately, it is about what is being done with the information.

Edit : As mentioned in other comments, there is great culinary diversity in Paris with foods from all over the world and fantastic examples of all of them inside the city -- that said, with the recent global food Renaissance creating a stronger demand for local ingredients and natural wines, French food has been updated in a huge way (as represented in the three places I listed above). I also know great places for Pho, and Japanese food (both sushi and gastronomic), and couscous, and falafel, and Ethiopian food, and burgers, some of which do and don't include ingredients produced in France. And while it's important to celebrate Paris for it's diversity, it's equally important to celebrate and support France with it's own culinary and agricultural traditions -- and support farmers by supporting locally sourced foods from time to time.

Besides, people haven't kept silent about this:

&gt;The revelation raises questions about the scope of the U.S. domestic surveillance program and would seem to confirm the cryptic warnings of Sens. Mark Udall (D-CO) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), both members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, about the use of ""secret legal interpretations"" to justify sweeping surveillance powers. In a letter to the attorney general last year, the senators wrote, ""We believe most Americans would be stunned to learn the details of .?.?these secret court opinions. As we see it, there is now a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows.""

It has been somewhat of a public secret that the US does these things, it's just that we are learning about more details now. I don't understand what part of it you consider a conspiracy or don't believe in? 

&gt;The existence of the highly classified program, known as PRISM, was confirmed by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper late Thursday. “It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States,” he said. “Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats.”

The program has become a central tool in the NSA's arsenal, and an increasingly large share of the intelligence reporting generated by the agency now comes from data generated by PRISM. Run with the assistance of the Silicon Valley tech companies it targets -- Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple -- the program offers the NSA access to a wide range of communications on the Internet.

Dal comunicato ufficiale:
Il gruppo parlamentare alla Camera MoVimento 5 Stelle, nell'apprendere del passaggio di due colleghi al Gruppo misto, desidera salutarli e augurare loro buona fortuna.
Auguri a Vincenza Labriola e Alessandro Furnari di buon lavoro, con l'auspicio che riescano a concretizzare molti efficaci progetti di legge: nel MoVimento 5 Stelle non sono infatti riusciti a proporne neppure uno, oltre ad aver apposto le loro firme a progetti altrui, siglando appena un paio di interrogazioni in due, in tre mesi di lavoro.

Siamo certi che al gruppo misto lavoreranno molto meglio, anche considerando che saranno finalmente liberi di disporre di tutto il denaro spettante senza dover più adempiere agli impegni presi con il codice di comportamento e col ""fastidioso"" Beppe Grillo. Argomento, questo, che hanno molto a cuore e su cui si concentra la loro ""dissidenza"".

Tale serenità economica consentirà loro anche di dedicarsi finalmente al problema Ilva, che da deputati tarantini vedono certamente come stella polare. Finora, però, non hanno purtroppo avuto modo di pronunciarsi o di impegnarsi in proposito neanche una volta, preferendo delegare in toto tale spinosa questione al senso di responsabilità degli altri colleghi pugliesi che ci stanno mettendo la faccia e l'impegno.
Per finire siamo sicuri che i due deputati, finalmente ""liberi"", sapranno rendere merito anche al nuovo titolo di cui potranno ora fregiarsi: l'onorevole Labriola e l'onorevole Furnari.

People always tend to think only idiots do an apprenticeship, which is simply not true. I studied economics and didn't enjoy my choice, so I broke off and take pride in doing an apprenticeship now - even though I'm paid slightly more than minimum (by law).

I said finishing my apprenticeship would allow me to study computer sciences, which is true.
However, I could break off my apprenticeship right now and apply to university for whichever field I want, because I finished highschool (with decent grades).

So an apprenticeship gives an opportunity to people who aren't good at school, but are good at whatever they want to do. The difficult part is finding a good place...

I would love to see some changes for certain things. But the US is certainly not the most corrupt place in the world. It typically ranks directly between Germany and France on the Corruption Perceptions Index. The EU passes directives that only benefit certain members as well. The measure requiring all olive oil to be served in sealed bottles  was only supported by olive oil exporting nations. Since artisan oils come from the same nations, it is pretty clear this was directed to support large producers there. Unless they just wanted to support them to be nice, there was clearly some lobbying on the industry's part.

Who knows how many people could have died on that attack, maybe none, maybe 1,000. But regardless some people are safer today because of it.   
But PRISM is just the newest development in a string of warrant-less wiretappings going back to the 1970's, and progressively getting more blanket and unconstitutional up to today. The United States has such a low terrorist casualty rate while living under this surveillance government. As a rule of statistics, without a control you cannot say that terrorist attacks are less dangerous than death by lightning or slipping in your bath tub and hitting your head (which is true, that so far more people die each year from accidents like that than terrorist attacks).

As much as I would have liked to see this, the Eurozone and the US did not have the same options that Iceland had. They are the only two true reserve currencies of the world. If there was a financial meltdown/severe devaluation of either of the currencies it would have wiped out far more wealth than just what exists in the US or Europe. It would have also changed international finance as we know it. People would be afraid to invest their wealth that wasn't lost in the world's two largest economies. No longer would nations have ""risk free"" assets like Bunds and Treasuries to store their wealth. 

Iceland's economy is smaller than that of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, or the city of Surat, India. Needless to say they had many more options when it comes to currency devaluation, financial market restructuring, and allowing bank defaults. 

As much as I agree with your sentiment, we would all be far worse off if the large economies of the world did not recapitalize their banks. Iceland had a lot more options. ",0,1370630823,null,0,false,0,cae8g6i,t3_1fslsy,t1_cae8g6i,t1_cadicgn,null,1430890583,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;Ora ho letto di queste novelle/storie brevi, il primo tipo (Blood of the Dragon, Path of the Dragon, Arms of the Kraken) dovrebbero essere raccolte dei capitoli dedicati da un certo libro (dany 1 e 3, greyjoy 4). La domanda su questi è: c'è qualche extra, magari collegamenti fra un capitolo e un altro, o magari cambiamenti di punti di vista (penso all'ultima parte dei greyjoy in feast per esempio che è vista tramite cersei)?

&gt;L'altro tipo invece quelle su Dunk and Egg (The Hedge Knight, The Sworn Sword, The Mystery Knight), semplicemente come sono? val la pena leggerle?

I remember reading, lots of years ago, a paper or something on the Maltese language. Before the British conquered it the Italian language was the prestige language, if I remember correctly, and after Malta became a British colony the role of the prestige language was taken by English and that's why it has so many loan words from these two languages. I heard  somewhere that there is a [diglossia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglossia)  now in Malta, where English is used alongside Maltese in everyday conversations sort of like the Lebanese use French ? I'm not so sure about that last one, I know that the Maltese have a very high English proficiency.... It used to be a British colony ( just like us! :D) and got its independence in the 70's or 60's ? It's Capital is Valletta and it is made up of about three islands and I think It's population is around 300 000. If I recall correctly, the emblem on it's flag is the emblem of the knights of St. John or something along those lines. It has a very beautiful flag!

Well not exactly. The party she represents is not exactly a party linked to some nation within the EU like the UKIP. She's part of a one issue party and thus I doubt a certain shift in public opinion would change her parties voting. It would only change how many vote for them. This does not only go for single issue parties but also for others as they'll generally somewhat follow a certain line on the political spectrum or focus on a number of issues and people vote according to those since they probably don't know a lot of MEPs personally. Hence I don't think it's such a huge issue that MEPs can't be discussing matters in their hometowns pub every evening and even then it wouldn't change too much if you look at the contrast between party members coming form the same country. There are probably parties that change their viewpoint on the fly according to public opinion but we'd call those populists.

ehm...So he does this waiting 2.5 years? Weren't the negotiations on Norwegian fishing quotas a huge debate during that time? If you might have looked at the numbers in the article he does that in the parliament too.

&gt;I guess Nigel laughs and thinks of it as a rebate for all the money the UK puts in..

A very personal rebate then...

&gt;Yer, thats his purpose... He wants to obstruct the EU from taking more powers and intruding further.

He uses up some money but how exactly does he stop the EU from taking more power by not being there!? I mean he can vote liberal on many things and keep the EU out of it! BUT HE DOES NOT VOTE. Him obstructing shit is a retarded argument for him being in the parliament. 

For example. The recent lawproposal for unified maximum prison punishment on hacking within the EU. If he is there he could vote [no] thus restricting the EU's influence a bit. But he probably won't be. As far as he goes now he does nearly nothing **and even fucks over his own voters that way.** (Bloody hell why I'm trying to advocate for UKIP voters here I don't even know) 

edit: When I said he obstructs it's work by simply not doing the job he signed up for all whiles inning the paycheck for it. I didn't mean him slowing the process. Not at all. Just makes it easier.

However, getting access to data stores, run, managed and maintained by others, as needed would work well for a state looking to run an excessive surveillance operation.  It would be cheaper, look more legitimate and probably generate more positives (still mostly false, but hey).  The government also has leverage with private companies so it wouldn't be that hard to achieve one way or the other...

Look at this PRISM thing, the costs per data target are $20M, they aren't storing vast amounts of data for that money.. But then they don't need to, they essentially have it available to them anyway whenever they want...

Why copy your mates music collection to an expensive disk array when you can access it whenever you want from wherever you are over a network.

The fact that they are spying on us is hardly any surprise. Think about what the Internet really is, Information. You can get hold of just about anything, and everything you do will send ripples across all those servers keeping it going. 
  What you do is as much information as what you are searching for, so to believe that there will be privacy in doing so is, imo, quite unrealistic.

true,ThePhlogist,ENGL,England,"[Here's the EP's actual press release which puts it in less confusing terms.](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130603IPR11005/html/Act-together-to-counter-cyber-attacks-urges-Civil-Liberties-Committee)

They're effectively saying if someone has committed a cyber-crime serious enough to warrant being given a maximum sentence then that maximum sentence should be at least 2 years. In theory it will only target the most serious examples of hacking and botnets. 

In the context of my country however, this would double the max. sentence for gaining access to a computer and would double the max. sentence for impairing the operation of someone's computer, [note section 35(3) and 36(6) here](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/48/part/5/crossheading/computer-misuse). This is not one of those clean-up operations the Commission has to do to get certain anomaly states to comply with common sense, this is a major change in the law for the UK. Maybe people could post the maximum sentences for hacking in their countries so we can get an idea of how this would change the law across all 27 MSs. 

I'm often uneasy about the Commission's mandate in criminal law. To be fair cyber-crime, as they say in the press release, is a truly global thing because of the reach of the internet and if any progress is going to be made in punishing people who deserve to be punished then it needs to be done internationally. Even so criminal law is such a coercive field of rules with such serious implications for personal liberties that the EU needs to tread very very carefully. 

Naturally, it's worth bringing to mind the fact the ECHR has our backs for a lot of our worries and hopefully it will continue to (fuck you Teresa May). 10 minutes of searching brought up the Council of Europe's [Convention on Cybercrime](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/185.htm) signed and ratified by most Council of Europe counties and therefore most EU countries. Check if yours has [here](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=185&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG). In that convention it encourages the criminalisation of cybercrimes like gaining access to information and intercepting information but provides in section 15 that signatory states shall:

&gt;...provide for the adequate protection of human rights and liberties, including rights arising pursuant to obligations it has undertaken under the 1950 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the 1966 United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other applicable international human rights instruments...

If you're charged you must be afforded a fair trial (Art. 6) and your imprisonment must be free from inhumane treatment (Art.3, this is an absolute right with no exceptions). In the context of Art.3 I would hope that what the US is currently doing to [Bradley Manning](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/05/extreme-solitary-confinement-what-did-bradley-manning-experience.html) (for what is effectively a cyber-crime) would be illegal in Europe because of Art.3. [Relevant reading on how the Obama administration treats whistle-blowers.](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/02/20122119527823867.html)

With the US and cybercrime in mind probably the most scary thing about increasing the sentence for hacking is the potential for using cybercrime legislation to both impede legitimate uses of this technology but most importantly to be able to silence people who want to release classified information to bring abuses of power and breaches of law by the state to light. There needs to be protection for whistle-blowers, even those who use computers to get their information. This is especially relevant this week as the NSA's surrvaillance network has been uncovered primarily through whistle-blowers. Naturally, malicious hacking should be illegal but a careful line needs to be draw between using computers to whistle-blow and actually breaking security systems and forcing access to information the latter of which should be prevented.

In short, the Commission should think long and hard before it encourages advanced democratic states to become more authoritarian and ensure it has the right balance. ",0,1370648162,null,0,1370651914,0,caeen20,t3_1fuqd1,t1_caeen20,t3_1fuqd1,null,1430887594,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I know in the US at least, every call to a congressman's office complaining about an issue is equivalent to about 20 voters who care about that same issue on election day but just decided to not call and complain.   
So when you've got someone angry enough to call about an issue, it means there's a lot more behind them who just aren't quite as inflamed to make the call.  
  
There's a sort of hierarchical measure of ""passion"", with actively running against the incumbent in an election at the top, down through volunteering on a campaign or or protesting with an organization and making flyers etc., down to letters to your representative, phone calls, and lastly e-mails. The point is, the more passion and energy you put into an issue, the more it matters to them. And if you only sign an online petition, or shoot them an e-mail, the reality is you don't care that much (or know what to do otherwise).  
  
So it's possible your e-mail just borked, but the most realistic scenario is that some intern read it, put a tick on the tally board for an issue, and deleted it.   
  
If we really care about this issue it's going to take a lot more, dare I say, *energy and motivation* than e-mails.  
  
If you really want to do something, find an organization that deals with privacy rights, make phone calls, get in touch with people, offer your support as a volunteer, protest, write a professionally *hand-written* letter to your MP or whoever, and engender your friends to care just as much.",0,1370655729,null,0,1370655924,0,caegwij,t3_1fv2tn,t1_caegwij,t1_caeeh3k,null,1430886529,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I studied abroad in Sevilla, so I'm a bit biased and will advocate that you study there. I also spent some time in other Andalucían cities, and absolutely fell in love with everything about it.  As previous posts have said, spring in sevilla is the most festive time, but I would argue that this is more the reason you should travel there then...even if it makes it a bit harder to concentrate sometimes, you are studying abroad for a reason: the experience!  Sevilla's passion and culture really shows in these months, and you'll get so much out of it then in any other month.  There are two universities to choose from in the city, depending on which goes along better with your courses.

Sevilla really does have lots to do, day and night!  I literally was able to go out every single night, as we had made a number of friends that showed us around the city and were excited to spend time with us!  They were our age and so we were able to see the city and live how they do, like it was normal life.  There are a number of clubs and bars to choose from, and again there are also a number of in this time period.  

To be honest, I would be disappointed if I traveled to Spain again and didn't go to Andalucía...it really is the most cultured and passionate region in Spain.

If you do decide to study (or at least visit) Sevilla, please let me know!  I have a number of friends I still talk to regularly (all around 20-22yo) that would love to help you with anything you'd need.  In our program, we met them online months before we arrived, so that we had already established friendships by the time we got there, and we all had a great time hanging out.  It's important you try to do this, as since they are locals, they can show you around the city you'd never discover from a book!

Sure, just not enough of them. Studies of trends in political activism have shown a decline, particularly since Watergate, in American political efficacy.   
The apathy you're purporting right now is exactly why more and more people are dropping off the political system, and instead complain about the lack of control we all have and how big government is so much larger than us and ""we're facing some systemic issues"".   
It's a feedback loop, citizens are disappointed in government so they drop out of participation in it. As more drop out, the vocal minorities retain more control over the majority (lobbies like the NRA, defense spending, big oil). Even more disappointment, more people drop out.  
This loop is just getting worse and worse every year, more people are dropping out of political participation.   
  
2008 was such an awesome year because Obama re-inspired a ton of people to come back into the political game and have faith. It worked for his election, and the same organization he created to organize the volunteers from the campaign made the difference in getting the Affordable Care Act passed. Since then.. it's been a little tougher. Still more disappointment, more people dropping out..  
  
But if we're all going to hate somebody for eroding our freedoms, we have no one to blame but ourselves. PRISM is no longer a secret, the court orders that evolved out of the patriot act were no secret, our journalist and whistleblowers have done us well in informing us of what's going on. Yet we let it happen. Because deep down, we really don't care - apparently. Or else we'd all be out right now protesting and blowing up our congressmen's phones.  
  
Elected officials are obsessed with polls, and when something bad happens and their office explodes with phone calls and angry constituents, you better believe they care - if only for their jobs, but this aligns with our demands. But phone calls are not exploding, instead all we do is gripe on internet forums like Reddit here.   
Olympia Snowe, a rare moderate republican from Maine, just left the Senate because she saw this happening. [Her new book](http://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Common-Ground-Stalemate-Congress/dp/1602862176/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370657638&amp;sr=1-1) says what I said but much more eloquently. After the Sandy Hook shooting, news pundits moaned about gun control, people cried to footage on CNN, but nobody called their congressmen and demanded action. You know who did get riled up and go to conventions and make a big stink to their representatives? The right. They were so worked up about losing their 2nd amendment rights they were able to defeat a bill including universal background checks that something like 90% of Americans supported.  
This is not a systemic *problem*, mind you, this was intentionally built in to our constitution. There was [a great thread about this the other day in /r/foodforthought.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Foodforthought/comments/1fps39/blocking_the_will_of_the_majority_is_a/) Basically, instead of depending on the rule of majority, our government is beholden to factions of extreme interest. The plurality of Americans actually decide how our government is run. What runs our republic is not ""majority interest"", it's passion. Those 10% NRA gun-wielding assholes were so loud and cared so much, while the 90% of Americans were like ""meh, yeah we really should have universal background checks, so what did you want for dinner?"". We didn't care enough about background checks to translate that into energy and action.   
  
And now you want to pull out of participation even more?   
Apathy is the cause of the problem, not the solution.

Yes it is highway robbery, but when governments go crazy, there is little for you to do if you have locked your money into accounts that you can't easily liquidate and move over borders. I myself currently contribute 50€ a month to private pension account, PS-tili, that is tax deductible and tax free, and also locked until I retire in 63 - 68. It is a small amount, but it should grow to be approx 30-40k€ when I retire. The rest goes to paying my apartment loan and to stocks.

I would say that the best option to secure the future is to diversify. Now most of my savings go to paying down the apartment, little go to the locked pension account, and the rest goes to stocks. If and when my liquid wealth goes over 100k€-150k€, it is a good idea to start diversify those holdings to different countries.

San Sebastian and Santander also have a Spanish language learning scene and are closer to France. But their winters can be pretty soggy. And San Sebastian is on the expensive side.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt; Because every single woman that has gone into modelling has done so due to outside factors influencing her and not in any way because they wanted to.

You didn't answer my initial question. Where did I assumingly stated the first of the above things you put in my mouth?

And again, where did I state or imply what you said now? Why, again, such an hyperbole instead?

To sum my argument up in terms so that you might understand it: have model shows on TV, fine. But why not shows about women in science or technology, or generally doing other stuff than the typical beauty/fashion/lifestyle-crap. 

You might also want to take note that *model shows do not portray an accurate depiction of the modelling industry*. Shit is hard work, and I would love to see real programs about how it really is, not the circus we can jerk off to.

Why give children - male and female - the impression that this, the picture you see in such shows, is the pinnacle of self-development women can aspire to? Do you really think Mrs Klum would be where she is without being fiercly intelligent and competitive, but knowing when to appear the way she does on shows? 

Yet that appearance is what is stuck in the minds of the people who are being influenced by watching it.

If you really think that this, a wish for realism and honesty, from all angles, is mysoginistic, because I want girls and boys to be able to chose between the metaphorical legos or puppets .. Well, fuck, I guess I am!

&gt;No, but it does imply immaturity. There are better ways to discuss an issue than running naked on a stage. Shock is the weapon of the uneducated. An intelligent person uses their words. 

This might be so, but then you'd have to account for the realities of inciting awareness. They're rather harsh in our world, with the heaps and bounds of noise everywhere. 

The audience they wanted to approach, and a sufficient level was right there at the show. They jumped in and did their thing, and it got them into the news for long enough for us to have a discussion about it.

The understanding of history (majorly and especially in the context of the history-learning youth in school) is indeed in relation with how many hundred years something ago something happened. Meaning, most pupils and people are intensely interested in WW II, while ancient Rome poses some sort of boring and unrealistic topic for them.

The assumption you are making however may also have its place, since (unfortunately) a growing number of teenagers are unable to establish a healthy relationship with the interest in historical topics. They have dissociated from the history of their country and have lost interest in it. But this applies not to the Third Reich only and exclusively, but to history as a whole.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt;The Greens opposed the agreement due to the failure to differentiate between different types of system breaches and hackers.

This is quite important.

I think everyone can agree that hacking a transportation network or a hospital is a criminal offense we shouldn't shrug off lightly. This has the potential to be physically threatening.

It's a different story if you get into some databank of a company. It's still a crime, but the potential for physical damage can be non-existent. 

That's a big difference, and should be treated as such.

Edit: **The proposed law is neither about setting minimum sentences, nor about capping maximum sentences. It is aimed at giving minima for the possible maximum sentences.**

&gt;The proposed rule would prevent E.U. countries from capping sentences for any type of hacking at less than two years.

I define ""capping"" as: to set a maximum. Then to apply the law would result in: 

=&gt; The maximum punishment for any type of hacking cannot be less than 2 years. 

&gt; Meanwhile the maximum sentence possible for cyberattacks against ""critical infrastructure,"" such as power plants, transport networks and government networks would be at least five years in jail.

=&gt;  The maximum sentence for the mentioned crimes cannot be less than 5 years.

It essentially gives you, as others have stated, an ""at least"" statement about the maximum sentences. This doesn't mean that hacking is to be punished by at least 2 or 5 years. It means that a judge can up your sentence to at least 2 or 5 years in case you find the porn stash of your local [governante](http://zulja.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/merkel-legger.jpg) and unwisely put it online for everyone to leer at.

I also have to note that in Finland we had the same kind of issue to deal with when we had our civil war in 1918. However the reconciliation process was much quicker as Finland returned to a democracy and was quickly united against the common enemy, the Soviet Union. Not to mention that in Finland the socialists did initialize a revolution and declared the country to be Socialist Workers' Republic. From the point of view of later generations, post-war and post-communist generations, it was great luck that the other side, whites, won the civil war as one could always look over the boarder of how things would have gone if Finland would have become a socialist/communist country. 

In Spain you didn't have the same luck. The Spanish Republic was heading towards becoming a socialist country, there is no question about, but the timeframe when things happened was a longer.

Weiterhin ist die normative Kraft von Konstrukten zu beachten. Hat man nun ein nicht- Realitätsbezogenes Konstrukt, dass auch noch negative Auswirkungen auf Individuen oder Gruppen hat, so ist das durchaus problematisch und man sollte aktiv gegen dessen weitere Verbreitung vorgehen. Am Ende ist es das gleiche Konstrukt das dazu führt dass Frauen gesagt wurde ""Geh in die Küche"" und dass (immer noch) dazu führt dass alleinerziehende Väter mit Kind aufm Spielplatz nicht viel zu lachen haben.

Das ganze hat also schon etwas analytischen Sinn. Als philosophische Grundposition ist das Ganze allerdings nicht zu gebrauchen (das sieht man daran wie sich nicht wenige Gender-Studies-Leute verrannt haben), da ist ""ein Schluss vom Stereotyp auf das Individuum ist ungültig"" einiges Sinniger.

Then the law proposal was changed to be only for foreign residents (we have many Anglicans and Catholics living here), but there was pressure to make it apply for Cypriots too. 

Then the Church brought up the matter of the plot market and all the jobs that would be lost if cremation was an option. 

Currently the Church seems to have changed their minds. They say cremation does not rule out the chance to be resurrected when the Second Coming happens, but they will refuse to eulogise those who choose to be cremated... People who probably don't belong to this Church anyway, as they are either western Christians or atheists who don't want a religious funeral and having to pay 1000s of euros to the Church to have their body disposed somehow.

In the current form of the bill, those who seek cremation must seek for a permit from the government beforehand. Their relatives can't just show up with the body in a cremation centre and ask for their services. Foreign residents pointed out that this is one more way to discourage cremation, because public servants refuse to speak English and the various forms rarely are available in English, so this is probably what will happen with the cremation permit too.

Some predict that the bill will be finally passed if Church is allowed to run the cremation centres and make up for the money they will lose from the plot market. ",0,1370685767,null,0,false,0,caendm2,t3_1fvkkn,t1_caendm2,t1_caenaah,null,1430883464,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

""And if you think that the majority of girls are naturally inclined to be treated like cattle and dressed up like puppets to be shoved around, and this is no result of social and peer pressure, then you're either delusional or a die-hard pessimist.""

&gt;To sum my argument up in terms so that you might understand it: have model shows on TV, fine. But why not shows about women in science or technology, or generally doing other stuff than the typical beauty/fashion/lifestyle-crap. 

Because those kinds of shows don't make money. Besides, there were and still are numerous shows with women that have nothing to do with modelling or lifestyle. 

&gt;You might also want to take note that model shows do not portray an accurate depiction of the modelling industry. Shit is hard work, and I would love to see real programs about how it really is, not the circus we can jerk off to.

Of course it's hard but it's also a job and unless your parents are rich you're going to have to take what you can get.

&gt;Why give children - male and female - the impression that this, the picture you see in such shows, is the pinnacle of self-development women can aspire to?

It doesn't give that impression and I'm not sure where you got that idea from. Modelling is a job like any other and what you're claiming is down to personal interpretation.


&gt;Do you really think Mrs Klum would be where she is without being fiercly intelligent and competitive, but knowing when to appear the way she does on shows? 

There is this trend in our society to see any rich and successful person as intelligent and whilst I'm sure there are successful people out there who got to where they are because they were smart, most of them were just really lucky.

&gt;Yet that appearance is what is stuck in the minds of the people who are being influenced by watching it.

I'm not sure what your aim is with these claims. Are you saying we should prevent women and men from going into modelling? 

&gt;If you really think that this, a wish for realism and honesty, from all angles, is mysoginistic, because I want girls and boys to be able to chose between the metaphorical legos or puppets .. Well, fuck, I guess I am!

But when people watch entertainment they don't want realism and honesty, they want lies. Why do you think reality TV shows are so successful? Women and men are more than capable of choosing their career paths without you or anyone else degrading their choices because they don't fit in with your pre-concieved notion of how the world should be. 

&gt;This might be so, but then you'd have to account for the realities of inciting awareness. They're rather harsh in our world, with the heaps and bounds of noise everywhere. 

They jumped on a stage naked and shouted a slogan. What did that solve? In order to raise awareness you need something for the public to latch onto. Generally, this involves a brief overview of what you're protesting and a concise argument against it. Those protesters achieved nothing.

&gt;The audience they wanted to approach, and a sufficient level was right there at the show. They jumped in and did their thing, and it got them into the news for long enough for us to have a discussion about it.

A couple of people discussing this on the internet is not what I'd call a smashing success. Awareness isn't raised through shock tactics. This incident will eventually be forgotten if it hasn't been already.

&gt;Now if we assume we're not the only ones, then one might say they were successful in one way.

We are the only ones discussing it on this thread. A quick search shows that we're the only ones discussing it on Reddit. This story might have gained more traction on other forums but it's highly unlikely that will amount to anything.

Das schöne daran ist, dass man praktisch alles aus dem ""Grundvorrat"" herstellen kann: Trockenhefe, Mehl, Zwiebeln habe ich sowieso immer im Haus, Schmand gibt es auch als ""H""-Variante die sich ohne Kühlung eine Weile hält. Speck kann man gewürfelt kaufen und man hat so recht schnell eine leckere Mahlzeit wenn man erst einmal raushat einen schön dünnen Hefeteig hinzubekommen.

**Gemüseeintopf**: Gemüse waschen und kleinschnippeln, dann in einem großen Topf eine Zwiebel kurz anschwitzen, Gemüse drauf, dann mit Wasser aufgießen und mit Gemüsebrühepulver (Glas) abschmecken.

Zur Gemüseauswahl: Ich nehme recht gern ein Paket Suppengemüse (das mit Lauch, Sellerie, Karotte) und dann noch das was grade Saison hat (z.B. Zucchini) und ein paar Kartoffeln. Das Gemüse dann je nach gewünschtem Biss garen (bei mir sind das so 15 Minuten). Dazu passen natürlich Wiener ganz gut.

&gt; [...] The Church condemns cremation and considers it contrary to its dogmatic teaching, and a disgusting act that cruelly offends the dead *[lit. the sleeping]*. Cremation is disrespect towards the Creator because it proves lack of belief for the life after death [...]
Those in favour of cremation claim better allocation of the space and prevention of polluting the substrata. Those are sorry excuses and untrue. The humans have polluted the atmosphere and threaten the whole ecosystem with natural resource abuses, and now hypocritically claim that the dead are a threat to public heath *[Tr.note: if fact the proponents of cremation bring up the 'right to choose', something that the Church doesn't even acknowledge]*. It fact the opposite is true. The cremation centres will be noisy and further pollute the atmosphere. It will also allow criminals to get away by destroying evidence. 

&gt; The deepest reasons for wanting to burn the dead is agnosticism, atheism and lack of belief for life after death. 

&gt; Cremation is the result of a nihilistic world-view and submission to conditions strange to the workings of Nature. Only few atheists, that are shaking in fear that they are created in God's image, because their hearts are empty and their consciousness are torn apart, might ask to be cremated, showing their satanic *[lit. Lucifer-y]* self-centred quirks. With their arrogant behaviour they show their disrespect for God and the lack of belief for eternal life. They also show their fear and the desperation to silence their reacting consciousness. They think that by cremating their bodies will end up in nothingness. But they will only succeed in cutting their ties with the Church, showing that they don't believe in resurrection and the all-powerful God, that in the end of times will resurrect all people, despite the cause of their death.

At least we are getting closer. 

Now you tell me *how* what I stated let you to make the comment that you did. Is my statement factually wrong? Is there, in reality, no influence exerted by the environment on human behaviour, no matter the sex? 

If not, then why? If yes, how does the statement that there is gave you the idea that I would see this as the sole cause of action by a human being?

To me, it is a very important one. I admit to that much, without hesitation. But just because I state that, for example, a lower socioeconomic background makes you more vulnerable to having a lower education later in life, does that mean that I believe poor people to be uneducated?

Did this led you to the conclusion that I somehow *also* argue that people who enter a profession in which this might be the case must also enjoy being treated that way? 

What exactly did you believe I wanted to express? 

Maybe what let to confusion here is the fact that I was referring to the TV show eplicitly, *not* anything else. And yes, I do believe that this is what is happening on such TV shows. That their whole set-up is to milk the dreams of young people for a few months or a year, and be judgemental and generally disgusting about it while earning money for the producers.

The reason I have this view is because it is, in essence, a formula that all kinds of casting shows have adhered to since the advent of the first British Idol or whatsitsname in the 1990s.

It doesn't matter if it's models or aspiring artists, they're milked and thrown on the trash. This is what I object to. 

The current show's also about the dominance of the classical role of women, and why *only showing this one* is dangerous, to me.

&gt;Because those kinds of shows don't make money. Besides, there were and still are numerous shows with women that have nothing to do with modelling or lifestyle. 

Obviously. And why do you think that is the case? Why does it seem to capture the attention of an entire society so well?

I have doubts that this is because millions of people freely chose to ""just enjoy it"". That's the unscientific answer you make when you do not want to confront that fact that all of us might have only a redudant shred of what we would call ""a conscious ability to decide"".

Ask your local psychologist what he thinks about a humans' ability to conscious decision-making. And if that is disabled, then what does it? To me, it's genetics/environment. 

And we can't influence the former.

&gt;Of course it's hard but it's also a job and unless your parents are rich you're going to have to take what you can get.

And modelling is the way out? This makes no sense. If you were to follow that route, at least in Germany, it's a far safer investment to simply do engineering or some other always-in-demand job that gives you certain financial stability and a high level of income.

No, modelling is for people who go for the superstar-effect, i.e. who want to enter an industry based on the premise that they could be one of the select few who make a disproportionate amount of income relative to their peers in the same industry (compare Klum to a model for some local restaurant).

It's the same fallacy many people make, it's simply bias towards your own ability to succeed. There's plenty of behavioural economic studies on it.

&gt;It doesn't give that impression and I'm not sure where you got that idea from. Modelling is a job like any other and what you're claiming is down to personal interpretation.

I just stated that modelling is a job like any other. Right there in my post. That was *my* whole point, that the way it is shown isn't the way modelling actually is. 

Very few TV shows about jobs actually show how it really is. And that was all of my criticism towards it, because people get the wrong ideas watching this.

Coupled with what I described above ([superstar effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstar#Economics_of_.22superstars.22)), is where I see the danger.

&gt;There is this trend in our society to see any rich and successful person as intelligent and whilst I'm sure there are successful people out there who got to where they are because they were smart, most of them were just really lucky.

I agree, partly. Especially because my disagreement is only in so far as to the factor in which luck is decisive differs from industry to industry, sometimes very sharply. 

I still cannot see how the show would give a positive image, however. Yet this might be subjective, in any case.

&gt;But when people watch entertainment they don't want realism and honesty, they want lies. 

And there you have it. People want lies. They don't want to be treated as adults. They just want their cozy little stupid bubble filled with stupid stuff. (See how much it sucks if somebody does hyperbole?)

But I guess this means that the TV show we argue about it successful, and so most likely not realistic? A lie? The kind of thing I dislike, because they give a false picture?

&gt;Why do you think reality TV shows are so successful? 

You tell me. Peer pressure generates tastes, maybe?

&gt;Women and men are more than capable of choosing their career paths without you or anyone else degrading their choices because they don't fit in with your pre-concieved notion of how the world should be. 

Where do I actively degrade anything? For God's sake, just give me the sentence where I explicitly state that ""I hate you because you do XYZ"" or ""XYZ should be illegal because it makes me uncomfortable"", or an ""I don't think this is true because I don't want it to be true""?

I think that some people make bad choices, yes. I think they are doing so, for a great part, not because they do it consciously but because they are slowly pushed into it. I think humans are stupid. I think humans are bad decision makers. 

*Yet I believe that we should be able to make them.* 

Can I make it more any more clear? 

I want to make it possible for us to make good decisions, whatever that means, by offsetting negative environmental influence with positive ones.

That's what all this discussion is about, after all.

And yes, I do criticise people for choices they make. However, you will notice that I will have reasons and will tell them so. If you can't stand criticism, then that's your problem. 

But a simple ""because it sucks"" or ""because I don't like it"", doesn't cut it. If you're still butthurt over the initial comment I make, keep in mind that I wrote a lot of text to explain what I meant by it in the past few days. 

My views aren't unjustified, even if you don't agree or like my argumentation, or even if they are false. I don't criticise because it's enjoyable, I do it because so many people do not, truthfully.

I think that I don't fit in your ""preconceived notion"" - what's next, you accuse me of writing in phallic format? - of somebody of whom you have made a convenient mental image already, for whatever reasons.

&gt;They jumped on a stage naked and shouted a slogan. What did that solve? In order to raise awareness you need something for the public to latch onto. Generally, this involves a brief overview of what you're protesting and a concise argument against it. Those protesters achieved nothing.

Again, I can't evaluate if they did or did not achieve anything. Certainly FEMEN is known to a lot of people by now, due to isolated actions such as the one we are talking about.

As I said, I have no intention to discuss this particular matter, because I have no idea what their statistical impact is. I can only guess.

&gt;A couple of people discussing this on the internet is not what I'd call a smashing success. Awareness isn't raised through shock tactics. This incident will eventually be forgotten if it hasn't been already.

How do you know we are the only ones? If each of one of us talks to one other person about what we discuss, that's 4 people influenced. That's probably 4 more than what either of us is going to achieve today.  

&gt;We are the only ones discussing it on this thread. A quick search shows that we're the only ones discussing it on Reddit. This story might have gained more traction on other forums but it's highly unlikely that will amount to anything. 

And reddit is somehow the world? 

As it happened, it was discussed in TV news, newspapers and was the talk of the morning all across Germany. That's sufficient, to say the least.

But, again, this is only guesswork, as is yours.

&gt;Those protesters achieved nothing.

true,Dutch_to_English,null,null,"&gt; The age of pension won't remain at 67, but will rise significantly over the next couple of years. The pensions, on the other hand, are dropping significantly. This shows from a letter from State Secretary Weekers to the House of Representatives. According to the letter, people who are currently 25 years of age will have to work until they are 71.5 years old. Meanwhile the rate of pensions is strongly affected by new measures

&gt; Those who will retire at 71 years of age will have to expect a large reduction in their income. According to part-time superhero Rajish Sagoeni, former president of the Royal Felowship for Actual things, pensioners will, in this scenario, be left with about 50% of their last earned salary. State Secretary Weeker uses much too positive scenarios in his calculations, according to the pensions expert. ""Weekers paints a far too rosy picture of the matter"".

&gt; Cabinet is planning to make the age at which people receive a pension dependent on life-expectancy. Weekers is assuming that people who are currently 25 years old will receive pensions at 71.5. The retirement age is also being associated with this age. This makes early retirement practically impossible. Those who quit working anyway at, for example 68 years of age, will receive a very small pension.

DVB-S works everywhere where your view to the satellite isn't obscured. If I remember correctly Astra's window is located around 40 degrees elevation and 161 degrees azimuth. Drawback here is that you have to install a relatively big antenna outside.

The government plans to use this to snach some lands that Sheldon Anderson wants to build Eurovegas and the owners don't want to sell. The social-democracy and the crony capitalism are compatible with a constitution like that. The government that passed that constitution didn't want a soviet-like system, but they were left-wing.

&gt; It was also a decisive force in the Spanish Civil War, organizing worker militias and facilitating the collectivization of vast sections of the industrial, logistical, and communications infrastructure, principally in Catalonia

And It happened ~~after~~ during the civil war. There were attemps before but they were stopped with blood. 

The republic killed anarchist militants that revolt against the government in 1933 with a left-wing government.

The problem is that building such a service is extraordinarily difficult. It's not just a matter of technology, which is difficult enough when those with the necessary know-how have to choose between working for a small shop here or having Google's data centers and databases as their playground, but a chicken-and-egg problem. You need data to generate value from data. Just look at what a hard time Google+ has against Facebook, despite all of Google's reach, marketing might, and opportunities to tie it in with their suite of services.  
As a simple example, take a music recommendation service. If you only have one user, recommendations are random. If you have millions, you can conclude that people who listen to artists A and B also tend to like artist C. If you have access to other databases, you could even take correlations between music styles and, say, product preferences, age and location into account.

We're only beginning to understand and make use of large datasets. It's a very promising field, with a lot of potential not just for marketing, but automatic separation of signal from noise (finding the information that is relevant for *you* in your present *context* -- if you thought the last Google I/O keynote didn't have any real highlights, watch it again under this aspect).

+4 groups of people. 

* Nationalist: They hadn't internal fights but there were divided between the ones that wanted a traditional conservative government and the ones that wanted a fascist government. The second group was backed by Hitler and Mussolini but the first group was stronger and before the end of the world war II the militar dictator moved the fascist out of the government. 
* Pro democratic-republic group. Very divided: Izquierda Republicana, Unión Republica, Partido Radical, ERC, half of the PSOE, ORGA... 
* socialst-communist revolutionists: PCE, Part of the PSOE and part of UGT(union). 
* Anarchists &amp; POUM(Trotskyist)
* PNV: very conservative basque party. They supported the republic. The republic promised high self-government to the Basque country.

And you can see more factions between different groups. Talking about only one revolutionist group is an error.

Example.](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/how-the-fbi-helps-terrorists-succeed/273537/)

Journalist Trevor Aaronson studied the court documents of the terrorism cases the FBI bragged about and he found basically what I said above. 

&gt; Why the U.S. provided at least **150 people** with bombs, transportation and other means of carrying out terrorist plots.

The FBI recruits informants amongst ex-felons and anyone really. They pay them five or six figures if they manage to give them a plot. This is a huge incentive and we know that such incentives actually lead to innocent people being accused (see the Innocence project and what they say about the use of snitchs). There is even an amusing case where the muslims going to the mosque where one of the informants was trying to find a terrorist plot asked for a restraining court order given how obnoxious and fanatic the guy sounded.

Moreover, there is also the case that even when individuals are talking about doing things, they won't do it until you provide them with the means to do so. So when the FBI provide them such means, they're motivating them ! It's worse when the informants are preying on weak individuals,  (see [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/opinion/sunday/terrorist-plots-helped-along-by-the-fbi.html?)).

He also remarked that none of the actual terrorists whose plots failed (Times Square bomber, the guy with the shoe, etc.) were caught with those operations, or were anywhere near one.

I guess it takes balls to pack what you have and leave for a country which you only know from talks. But there are two major things which need to be explained (among many other):

1) Somebody needs to explain to the Romanians that Germany isn't so strong, rich and stable because of a God blessing as the pastor mumbled in the video. They have a chance now to join the ""German dream"" with all it takes, i.e. learning the language, respecting the law and hard work.

2) Somebody needs to explain to Germans that they are not being invaded by hungry grasshoppers who come to demolish their welfare system. There's the German lifestyle, good reputation, values, freedom and tolerance which attracts people from other parts of Europe to their country. Hopefully a bunch of xenophobic sexually frustrated jokers won't send a sign to the world that the mentioned values are not valid anymore in Germany..

Of course there is. However, you're overreaching with your claim. 

&gt;If not, then why? If yes, how does the statement that there is gave you the idea that I would see this as the sole cause of action by a human being?

You're vehemently arguing against modelling as a profession and infantilizing women by claiming that their career choices are not a result of decisions that they made themselves but of the influence exerted on them by their peers/environment. You're essentially implying that women who chose to go into modelling did so under duress. 

&gt;To me, it is a very important one. I admit to that much, without hesitation. But just because I state that, for example, a lower socioeconomic background makes you more vulnerable to having a lower education later in life, does that mean that I believe poor people to be uneducated?

No, but you are implying that most of them will end up that way. 


&gt;I used strong language about how I think human beings do not, generally, want to be treated. 

No, you made a sweeping generalization about a career choice and the people who choose to go into it. 

&gt;Maybe what let to confusion here is the fact that I was referring to the TV show eplicitly, not anything else. And yes, I do believe that this is what is happening on such TV shows. That their whole set-up is to milk the dreams of young people for a few months or a year, and be judgemental and generally disgusting about it while earning money for the producers.

Those are baseless claims, not factual statements. Just because some abuses occur doesn't mean the entire modelling industry is marred by them. 

&gt;t doesn't matter if it's models or aspiring artists, they're milked and thrown on the trash. This is what I object to. 

That's, again, not a factual statement. Work load and pay depends on the agency and/or business the model chooses to sign up with. 

&gt;The current show's also about the dominance of the classical role of women, and why only showing this one is dangerous, to me.

And? 

&gt;Obviously. And why do you think that is the case? Why does it seem to capture the attention of an entire society so well?

I don't know. Why is a good marketing campaign necessary to sell products? 

&gt;Ask your local psychologist what he thinks about a humans' ability to conscious decision-making. And if that is disabled, then what does it? To me, it's genetics/environment. 

Do a case study about it then. Prove your claims. 

&gt;And we can't influence the former.

You have a very meager understanding of genetics.

&gt;And modelling is the way out? 

Germany's current job needs are nursing and engineering. Nursing requires you to spend twelve hours every other day taking care of patients or doing lab work depending on which specialization was chosen. Nurses are constantly overworked, suffer from chronic sleep deprivation and job and pay satisfaction are extremely low.

Engineering requires a comprehensive knowledge of a number of complicated subjects. Universities that specialize in engineering are highly competitive places and the same applies to the job market. 

You figure it out. 

&gt;No, modelling is for people who go for the superstar-effect, i.e. who want to enter an industry based on the premise that they could be one of the select few who make a disproportionate amount of income relative to their peers in the same industry (compare Klum to a model for some local restaurant).

And you know this how?

&gt;I just stated that modelling is a job like any other. Right there in my post. That was my whole point, that the way it is shown isn't the way modelling actually is. 

And what job is shown exactly the way it is? 

&gt;Very few TV shows about jobs actually show how it really is. And that was all of my criticism towards it, because people get the wrong ideas watching this.

That's true for virtually every single show about particular jobs out there. What's your point? 


&gt;I still cannot see how the show would give a positive image, however. Yet this might be subjective, in any case.

Why should it?

&gt;And there you have it. People want lies. They don't want to be treated as adults. They just want their cozy little stupid bubble filled with stupid stuff. 

Exactly. 

&gt;But I guess this means that the TV show we argue about it successful, and so most likely not realistic? A lie? The kind of thing I dislike, because they give a false picture?

Could you reiterate that sentence please? I'm having trouble making sense of it. 

&gt;Where do I actively degrade anything? For God's sake, just give me the sentence where I explicitly state that ""I hate you because you do XYZ"" or ""XYZ should be illegal because it makes me uncomfortable"", or an ""I don't think this is true because I don't want it to be true""?

You didn't say it but you certainly implied it.

&gt;I think that some people make bad choices, yes. I think they are doing so, for a great part, not because they do it consciously but because they are slowly pushed into it. I think humans are stupid. I think humans are bad decision makers. 

Are you implying that modelling is a bad career choice?

&gt;I want to make it possible for us to make good decisions, whatever that means, by offsetting negative environmental influence with positive ones.

What constitutes a good decision and what doesn't differs from person to person.

&gt;And yes, I do criticise people for choices they make. However, you will notice that I will have reasons and will tell them so. If you can't stand criticism, then that's your problem. 

""Let him without sin cast the first stone.""

&gt;My views aren't unjustified, even if you don't agree or like my argumentation, or even if they are false. I don't criticise because it's enjoyable, I do it because so many people do not, truthfully.

And feel free to do so until your fingers fall off. I don't care and truth be told I couldn't give two shits about the modeling industry. 

&gt;Again, I can't evaluate if they did or did not achieve anything. Certainly FEMEN is known to a lot of people by now, due to isolated actions such as the one we are talking about.

You can claim that but it won't make it true. FEMEN is as unknown to the general public now as it was back in 2008 when it was founded and if you think their radicalism will make a difference then I can tell you right now you're wrong. 

&gt;How do you know we are the only ones? If each of one of us talks to one other person about what we discuss, that's 4 people influenced. That's probably 4 more than what either of us is going to achieve today. 

You're being way too optimitic if you think people care about these sorts of things. By next week nobody will even remember FEMEN or this incident.

&gt;And reddit is somehow the world? 

No, but it is a fairly large social hub filled with idealistic teenagers/young adults; the perfect breeding ground for activists. If this story doesn't take off here it's highly unlikely it will do so anywhere else.

&gt;As it happened, it was discussed in TV news, newspapers and was the talk of the morning all across Germany. That's sufficient, to say the least.

Do you remember that story about the hosts of a generic morning show making fun of a guy for having his penis cut off? Of course you don't and neither does the internet.

Inequality being one of them: society tries to push someone into a mold which will most likely not fit, e.g. traditional roles for women (stay-at-home mother). There is also at least one example in the article, those young muslim women who want to wear a headscarf without being patronised. That's an issue of conformism, not (only) feminism. 

I mean, feminism has achieved much. (I'm talking about Germany here, because I can't say much about other countries except Switzerland.) And that's great, seriously... But I think it's starting to get ridiculous. If my husband and I have children and we get divorced I'll get them *in almost any case* ... If I'm applying for almost any job out there (especially in STEM) my application is prioritized because I am a woman... and so on... Of course there are still some things society needs to discuss in this regard, for example that men get paid more than women for the same job (in Germany though!)

&gt;The author of that comment probably doesn't know the difference between feminism which is about equality, and radical feminism which is about special privileges and crazy.

*The article* OP posted is about feminism in Germany and what can I say, there is (almost only) radical feminism left.

I know that it might be a completely different situation in, for example, ukraine or some strictly conservative countries or regions. Of course what I said does only apply to Germany (and partially to Switzerland, although they are a bit more conservative on that matter).

Edit: Some employers still prefer men because ""they can't get pregnant"" and are ""less likely to drop out and be stay-at-home dads"" ... again, conformism. The employer doesn't expect the man to stay at home and care for the children. You can't fix this without breaking up fossilized structures... and for that you need people who are able to think independently (not egocentric though...)

That guy was just filth - not surprised he was caught.  He'll be let off though - Maltese courts are a joke.  What's more is that the new Government (that John Dalli has essentially supported since he lost the PN leadership election) has just appointed a new Police Commissioner, so if the case even gets to court, I'll be surprised.

Another interesting (and little known) fact is that he is a significant shareholder in MediaToday, a company that publishes one of the more popular newspapers on the island.  It's been proclaiming his innocence from the start (while **never** posting a disclaimer).

No, I'm afraid you're completely missing the point. This isn't about Nixon's contributions in general. Not at all. It is a metaphor, based on the idea that only a staunch anti-communistic hardliner such as Nixon was able to get away with visiting China and opening up the relation between the two countries. Any politician with a less conservative reputation would not have gotten away with it, as it would have been interpreted as ""being soft on communism"". 

So the expression is now used to describe the phenomenon that sometimes, only a politician from one side of the political spectrum can get away with a controversial policy that one would usually expect from a hardliner of the other side of the spectrum.

Premièrement merci de ne pas amalgamer inutilement les tendances libérales ( que tu traduis honteusement par libertaires ) et les conservateurs. Les conservateurs se satisfont parfaitement d'un plus d'Etat pourvu que l'Etat leur bénéficie et corresponde à leur concept d'une majorité qui se veut écrasante et inchangée. 

Je suis bien conscient de la dimension toujours plus importante de l'Etat, dans ses prérogatives de redistribution. Simplement, il suffit de ne pas se leurrer de trop pour observer que l'Etat en France est immobilisme et impuissance et entretien de cet immobilisme et de cette impuissance. Le problème fondamental que cela pose aujourd'hui plus qu'avant, avec l'augmentation des facilités de mouvement des personnes et l'émergence d'une culture globale, c'est qu'on n'est plus lié pour des raisons matérielles par cette forme de contrat social et l'impossibilité d'y faire entendre sa voix. La question n'est plus : ""Est-ce que le système fonctionne ( ce qui n'est plus trop le cas ) et correspond-il aux attentes de la population ( ce qui est aussi objectivement de moins en moins le cas, l'atmosphère est ""étouffante"" ) ?"" mais ""Ai-je le choix ( ou le droit ) de m'extraire de cette domination qui m'a été imposée ( et si tel est mon désir d'y consentir de mon plein gré ) ?. 

L'Etat actuel se sert aussi de la redistribution pour fabriquer le consentement de ses sujets. Qu'il s'agisse de paix sociale par des allocations ou de l'emploi factice ( emplois jeunes ), d'un discours favorable par les aides aux medias et dans l'Education Nationale, et, plus généralement, d'une mise sous coupe de ce qui n'est pas lui, entreprises, religions, familles.

Finalement, il me semble inévitable d'avoir à remettre en question cette prégnance à un moment où il devient de plus en plus évident qu'il n'arrive plus à faire le grand écart entre des désirs individuels de plus en plus distincts même au sein d'une population supposément homogène en raison des progrès technologiques, du droit international et d'un discours transnational faisant coexister des vérités très différentes, et où la fabrication et la perpétuation de ce discours de consentement fait peser un poids potentiellement infini sur ses finances. Une façon d'illustrer cela est l'urgence de faire passer des lois comme le mariage homosexuel qui étaient censés augmenter ce consentement et qui, au final, se heurtent à des mouvements contestataires qui le menacent de manière presque contre-intuitive. 

Je pourrais développer plus avant mais je voudrais conclure qu'on peut ne pas être égoïste et pourtant pour des raisons personnelles ( qui peuvent avoir trait à la question ethnique et d'un sentiment d'exclusion intériorisé comme c'est peut-être c'est le cas pour Tsonga ou des questions d'opinions ressenties comme minoritaires notamment sur le bien-fondé de certaines dépenses sanctuarisées qui ne sont pour ainsi dire jamais livrées en pâture au débat public ) refuser d'être lié à ce système.

&gt;so if I wanted to connect to guifi.net how close would I need to be from a node? Are the nodes the small yellow dots on the map?

Yellow points are the not connected people but they are interested. Actually, you need to mark your position over the map to see how to connect with a working node (the green ones), your first ""status"" will be yellow.

&gt;How is then the access to the internet? Just like any other connection or are there special rules? or any striking difference from the way we're used to access and use the internet from a commercial connection?

If you want to use the guifi network must follow the Wireless Commons License:

https://guifi.net/en/WCL_EN

&gt;The Wireless Commons License[1] describes the principles, terms and conditions for many libre and open wireless community networks. In summary it gives the right to use the network for any purpose unless you affect the operation of the network or the freedom of other users, the right to know and learn any detail of the network and its components, the freedom of joining or extending the network following the same conditions.

&gt;Community networks following this license are used, owned, operated, extended and governed by the community, the same group people with no separation between service providers and users. It can be seen as an equivalent license for libre and open wireless community networks compared to software licenses for libre and open software.

Depending on how far you are, you will need a type of antenna or another:

* http://www.ubnt.com/airmax#nanostationm (close distances)
* http://www.ubnt.com/airmax#nanobridgem (medium distances)

There people that manage diferent kind of servers inside the network, so they can offer different kind of services to the guifi community for free (or even paying):

* https://guifi.net/en/node/2413/view/services

If you don't want to pay anything for the internet, you simply should use one of the many proxy servers inside the network. But if you need more quality there are cooperatives of users that have fiber optic acces to the [Neutral Internet Exchange Points](http://www.catnix.net/en/)  (the places where commercial companies connect their racks to the global Internet).

One of these cooperatives is EXO.Cat, it's 10€/month. The acces  to the neutral point is is done by with a [VPN tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Private_Network):

* http://exo.cat/

&gt;One would only need to get an antenna to connect to the nodes (plus a router I guess for the home wifi) and that's it?

Yes, that's it. But remember, you have to consider the distance between you and the node. If you are close to a node, with a cheap antenna is enough, medium distance requires a little parabolic antenna, and large distances requires relative large parabolic antennas.

But would you have expected a young Democrat with a strong liberal reputation who was perceived as a fighter for civil liberties and transparency and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to order hundreds and possibly thousands of drone strikes and to crank up surveillance to this level? 

And the drone strikes were already common knowledge before the leaks about PRISM. Imagine those strikes were ordered by someone like Dick Cheney -- I think the outcry would have been much more significant.

(alors que l'acquis de la Revolution c'est justement qu'elle n'est que l'incarnation de la souveraineté du peuple).
C'est typiquement ce dont je parle quand tu dis ça ""L'Etat actuel se sert aussi de la redistribution pour fabriquer le consentement de ses sujets"". C'est vrai dans le sens où effectivement le citoyen n'a aujourd'hui que peu de prises dans la façon dont les affaires politiques se gèrent sur le temps long, mais en même temps complètement faux dans le sens que la logique Bismarckienne d'achat de la paix social n'a pas en soit cour aujourd'hui. L'Etat c'est la volonté et la souverainneté des citoyens qui le font et si les citoyens eux même l'oublie c'est le début du despotisme.

&gt;l'émergence d'une culture globale

Je nie complètement que cette culture existe, la culture globale c'est une américanisation (qui prend la suite de la mondialisation Anglaise) des comportements et des moeurs teintées de parfums régionalistes. C'est tout simplement le parfum d'une défaite et d'une acculturation.

&gt;cette forme de contrat social et l'impossibilité d'y faire entendre sa voix.

C'est la base même d'un régime démocratique le contrat social, et ce n'est pas en renonçant que cela va changer. Un ""exilé"" fiscal ne va pas en chercher un autre de contrat, il va simplement adopter un comportement proche des bourgeois sous la monarchie : ""le pouvoir politique on s'en fout c'est la thune qu'on veut"". Ce qui se passe n'est rien d'autres qu'un mouvement de moyen-âgisation où les vues clientélistes prennent le pas sur les absolus que sont la Nation ou la démocratie.

&gt;droit international 

Pour en avoir fait le droit international ""n'existe pas"", ce n'est pas un ""droit"" ce sont des dispositions contractuelles entre parties. En l’occurrence les dispositions reflètent la vision des vainqueurs de 45 et c'est entrain de changer

&gt;Une façon d'illustrer cela est l'urgence de faire passer des lois comme le mariage homosexuel 

Ça c'est essentiellement le poids d'une logique justement de plus en plus communautaire et individualiste qui veut voir des différences fondamentales partout, tout en prétendant lutter contre ces mêmes différences qui fondent les discriminations. 

&gt;Je pourrais développer plus avant mais je voudrais conclure qu'on peut ne pas être égoïste et pourtant pour des raisons personnelles

Raisons personnelles qui fondent le discours de certains partis politiques et leur projet politiques. Ce qui est proprement anti-démocratiques.

Dans ce cas la seule positions que je trouverais respectable est le détachement complet au système : renoncement à la citoyenneté, de concourir sous des couleurs national ou de faire son CA en France etc...

(alors que l'acquis de la Revolution c'est justement qu'elle n'est que l'incarnation de la souveraineté du peuple).

Mouais, si tu parles de la France éternelle qui voit sa représentation dans la figure du Roi, les conservateurs du 19e alors. Les conservateurs républicains sont au moins autant attachés à la notion d'Etat fort que les sociaux-démocrates de l'Etat-providence, simplement ils tentent de substituer la Nation au Peuple. ( après ya les cas pathologiques type Chevènement ou Royal qui brouillent un peu les lignes ). 

&gt;dans le sens que la logique Bismarckienne d'achat de la paix social n'a pas en soit cour aujourd'hui.

Honnêtement si, cf les exemples que j'ai donné. La logique n'est peut-être plus strictement bismarckienne mais on achète la paix sociale en France avec des budgets discrétionnaires autant qu'avec des mécanismes d'allocation et de prestations sociales. 

&gt;L'Etat c'est la volonté et la souverainneté des citoyens qui le font et si les citoyens eux même l'oublie c'est le début du despotisme.

L'Etat, c'est la volonté d'une oligarchie/technocratie de maintenir son pouvoir. On demande aux citoyens leur consentement pas leur opinion. C'est pour cela qu'il me semble normal même si tenant d'une logique défaitiste que l'individu puisse devenir citoyen de la société qui lui convient le mieux en acceptant qu'il ne puisse la transformer qu'à la marge. 

&gt;Je nie complètement que cette culture existe, la culture globale c'est une américanisation (qui prend la suite de la mondialisation Anglaise) des comportements et des moeurs teintées de parfums régionalistes. C'est tout simplement le parfum d'une défaite et d'une acculturation.

C'est faux et c'est d'autant plus faux pour les élites. Il y a des cultures mais qui ne sont plus liées aux frontières ( au moins dans le monde occidental ), les étudiants vont dans les mêmes universités, y parlent la même langue, ont les mêmes soucis vis-à-vis de la structure unifiée du monde du travail. La culture en tant que définition d'une identité nationale ( gros mot, je sais ) a disparu au terme de la massification de l'école. On a voulu faire supprimer à l'élite sa main-mise sur la culture nationale ce qui a brisé la culture nationale. Les élites ont donc du trouver ailleurs et notamment au niveau de l'économie internationalisée leur primauté perdue. 

&gt;C'est la base même d'un régime démocratique le contrat social, et ce n'est pas en renonçant que cela va changer. Un ""exilé"" fiscal ne va pas en chercher un autre de contrat, il va simplement adopter un comportement proche des bourgeois sous la monarchie : ""le pouvoir politique on s'en fout c'est la thune qu'on veut"". Ce qui se passe n'est rien d'autres qu'un mouvement de moyen-âgisation où les vues clientélistes prennent le pas sur les absolus que sont la Nation ou la démocratie.

Absolument pas, le contrat social implique un renouvellement constant de celui-ci et non de le recevoir en héritage ( cf Jefferson qui disait que les constitutions devaient être revue tous les 20 ans ). Et les élections qu'on voulait croire une réaffirmation de ce consentement se sont transformées en réaffirmations périodiques de cette absence de consentement et c'est pourquoi on se lamente constamment de l'abstention. 

&gt;Pour en avoir fait le droit international ""n'existe pas"", ce n'est pas un ""droit"" ce sont des dispositions contractuelles entre parties. En l’occurrence les dispositions reflètent la vision des vainqueurs de 45 et c'est entrain de changer

Le droit international existe même si l'utilisation que j'en ai faite n'était pas dans un but de précision juridique. Il y a des instances de réglementations et d'arbitrage, des organisations qui formulent ce droit qui trouve effectivement ses sources dans des accords entre parties souveraines, et pour ce qui nous intéresse un droit supra-national dans le cas de l'Europe qui permet tout de même un certain nombre de facilités concernant la mobilité des personnes. 

&gt;Ça c'est essentiellement le poids d'une logique justement de plus en plus communautaire et individualiste qui veut voir des différences fondamentales partout, tout en prétendant lutter contre ces mêmes différences qui fondent les discriminations. 

Le poids de la réalité donc. Qu'on peut tenter de fabriquer le consentement, mais plus de la façon dont on le faisait auparavant avec des purges et autres assimilations forcées car nous sommes dans des Etats de droit. Le projet d'homogénéisation étatique n'est plus légitime car l'Etat ne trouve plus sa légitimté dans la Nation mais dans la protection des libertés et du droit des individus. 

&gt;Raisons personnelles qui fondent le discours de certains partis politiques et leur projet politiques. Ce qui est proprement anti-démocratiques.

Raisons personnelles qui tiennent de la liberté de l'individu. Je comprends pas la critique anti-démocratique. C'est l'expérience personnelle qui nous construit en grande partie. Elle est donc un élément indispensable de la construction du discours politique. 

&gt;Dans ce cas la seule positions que je trouverais respectable est le détachement complet au système : renoncement à la citoyenneté, de concourir sous des couleurs national ou de faire son CA en France etc... Refuser le système c'est bien mais dans ce cas il faut le faire jusqu'au bout. Sinon on essaye d'agir pour convaincre ses co-citoyens et changer le système.

C'est peut-être pas non plus l'intérêt de la France. Elle ne résoudra pas ses problèmes d'attractivité avec des politiques allant contre les individus. D'une part, la nationalité est aussi un héritage culturel qu'il n'a pas forcément lieu de rompre pour des raisons idéologiques. A ce titre, la personne qui ne vit pas en France, ne contribue pas au poids de sa dette ou à ses impôts mais qui reste en quelque sorte un héritier de la France ne lui porte nullement préjudice quant à son projet politique et au contraire peut conserver une activité professionnelle qui produit des bénéfices en France même si elle choisit de ne plus faire partie du corps citoyen. Elles donnent aussi en général une bonne image de la France, sorte de VRPs gratuits. Personnellement ce qui me dérange le plus c'est la représentation des Français de l'étranger en tant que Français de l'étranger au parlement. Alors que l'argent qu'on dépense pour eux est une contre-partie du fait qu'ils servent la politique économique de la France. D'autre part, il y aussi des notions de droit qui rendent cela impossible, notamment le droit à la famille ( s'ils veulent revenir en France et consommer ponctuellement pour voir leur famille devra-t-on leur interdire car ils sont égoïstes ? ), ou l'impossibilité de déchoir des gens ne disposant que d'une nationalité.

If you need to get something off site, why not just store it in your own account at your own web host, out of your country, if necessary.

I run a web site and listserver in the US which is often critical of government, and I've sued government agencies. The Feds are famous for raiding sites and taking away all the files and equipment before any trial, destroying what you need to proceed with cases and other work.

Therefore I mirrored my site with a Canadian company. If the Feds want what's there, they'll at least have to start a legal procedure in another country to get it, and I'll have an opportunity to oppose it. 

And, I can continue to run, even if they've confiscated everything they could get their hands on.

Everyone says it's stupid to write your own encryption, but I've done so, just in case.

It's different because, when you take a 30-year mortgage, you have terms that cannot be altered (especially if you have a 30-year fixed rate mortgage) and it's backed by a real asset. You do have risk, certainly--housing market crashes could put you underwater--but it's different because the mathematics of many government pension funds simply don't work. Take the pension funds of US states, for example: they're underfunded (Florida's public sector fund is 86% funded) and using an unrealistic discount rate--Florida's is 7.75%, meaning their pension fund is probably even *more* underfunded.

For my planning, it means that I don't take public funds (or DB pensions, I don't have one though) into account when I am thinking about retirement. Is this, in all likelihood, unrealistic?

Just because a lot of people with Gypsy heritage are absolute stupid assholes, does not mean it's because of race, or that they will always be like that. They're like that because of their situation and their family, ect. They can move out of it. Someone can come from a gypsy family and be an amazing person, however a lot of people just assume that because they are from gypsy families that they are worthless individuals. That is something I cannot stand. Maybe, there's a good chance that when you see someone from a gypsy family and you make a guess that they're an asshole, the chances might be, that you're right. However, making that judgement is pointless and only perpetuates the situation. That person has the ability to surprise me, because there's nothing inherently bad about gypsies. I will not pre judge them and I will give them the same possibilities I would give any one else, because they are people first, and gypsies second. Yeah, a lot of them might be assholes, but not all of them. And I give every single one of them the chance to prove to me that they're not an asshole. I would act nicely to a gypsy a hundred times, a thousand times, ten thousand time and they could turn out to be an asshole every single one of those times, and I would still give the next gypsy I meet the chance to prove to me that they are a nice, good and honest person.

I agree, an NHS style system wouldn't work in the USA.

As far as gun ownership...to be honest, this is something I am on the fence about. I feel like a lot of Europeans overestimate the effect gun laws have (especially the shitty ""assault weapons bans""...such a useless law). The US has very high gun crime and violent crime statistics, but the actual distribution is interesting: outside of inner cities, the US has very similar crime stats to Western Europe--it's really very safe. There are, however, pockets of minority poor communities--Compton, to name a famous one, or..well, the whole city of Detroit--with *extremely* high crime statistics that massively push up the US crime average. What's not said is that these crimes don't happen to often to innocents--it's usually criminal-on-criminal violence. Also, 95% of gun crimes occurs with pistols --not covered under the AWBs. I think, to be honest, that parts of the US have a culture and poverty problem, not a gun problem.

Economically, I'm a centrist, hovering between progressive and libertarian depending on the issue. The objectionable thing about the Republican party, however, is their social policy. I'm sorry, but I cannot get behind an anti-abortion party who's pumping up fears against gay marriage and gay adoption.

There is a need for a moderate small-government/Hayekian/libertarian voice in US politics, but the Republican party has way too much cultural baggage for my taste.

He initially left for a few years and briefly rejoined to run for the 2008 election.  There was an uneasy spell with him in government, but when the opportunity came up to make him a commissioner, he was pretty much promoted up and out.  It didn't look like a bad appointment - seasoned politician and longtime party member, with a rough relationship with the PM.

After he turned out to be one of the biggest embarrassments of the country, the PM sent his right hand man - the deputy PM.  Although he's very conservative, I'd be surprised if he were caught up in a Dalli-like scandal.  The PM (Gonzi) probably figured we couldn't afford 2 corruption scandals in succession, so figured better safe than sorry.

With respect to his personal beliefs, I think they suck.  Having said that, he was always a cabinet member in governments that continuously improved Malta's respect for gay rights and especially women's rights (bringing us inline with EU Law).  It wasn't until the early 90's that women could do anything (like buy appliances) without a husband's signature (!) - Tonio Borg was in a cabinet that removed the requirement for a husband's signature.  What he seems to do and what he believes seem to be oddly compartmentalised.

Don't get me wrong - he's from a wing of the PN that make me very uneasy, but he it seems that believes and what he does are different (in Malta that's not uncommon - the most laissez-faire Catholics in the world).

As regards the rest of the population - acceptance of gay rights seems to be growing exponentially, which is good to see although the current government is also against same-sex marriage.  It's been good to see more of the LGBT community get into the spotlight - it wasn't the case 10 years ago.  Women's rights are generally OK.  I think rape isn't punished hard enough though (neither is child abuse).  The abortion thing is crazy.  I'm one of the few people I know who is unreservedly in pro-choice, so I've had debates with women where I advocate their right to choice and they tell me I'm a baby-killer (the thought always mindfucks me).",0,1370728718,null,0,false,0,caewyka,t3_1fulih,t1_caewyka,t1_caetu0x,null,1430878878,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
