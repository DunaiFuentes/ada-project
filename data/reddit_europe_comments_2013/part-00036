Point being, this is one German's nationalistic pride. Would you hear this from, say, a Bulgarian?

In addition, I would add that the only places I seemed to find non-English-speaking Germans was behind the counter of Irish bars. Guys, don't open an Irish bar where an Irishman can't order a pint.

- Referendum per uscire dall'euro: con quali numeri pensi di cambiare la costituzione ?   
- 1000 euro di reddito di cittadinanza pagati con un miliardo di euro recuperati dalla restituzione retroattiva dei soldi di finanziamento ai partiti: che famo, pignoriamo il tv a Rutelli? sicuro che poi il ""miliardino"" basti?  
- Primo partito in Italia: bene, perchè allora tieni nascosto chi proporrete per alla presidenza del consiglio? è una sorpresa?
- Tutti a casa: come fai, occupi le rimanenti sedie del parlamento con dei maglioncini?  
- 100% energie rinnovabili: entro quanti anni? a quali costi?
- Wifi gratis: chi paga per tutti?  
- Le televisioni di tutto il mondo ci seguono: non ti sei accorto che però ti ritraggono come un clown e un pericolo?  
- L'europa ci teme: la ritieni una cosa positiva? perché allora continui a citare esempi europei per conferire validità alle tue proposte?  
- Economia: credi davvero che abolire auto blu e finanziamenti vari copra i costi del tuo programma? come mai qualsiasi taglio tu proponga fa  recuperare esattamente un ""miliardino""? spari numeri a caso?
- Sono solo un portavoce: chi decide l'indirizzo politico del tuo movimento? chi decide chi e chi non può farne parte? 
- Sono un garante: perchè allora dici di non conoscere i tuoi candidati? garantisci solo per la loro fedina penale pulita?
- Giornalisti italiani: Perchè cacciarli, che comunicano ogni giorno alla nazione ciò che tu dici in piazza e su internet? perché continui ad additare  chiunque sia esterno al movimento come nemico da distruggere?
- La democrazia diretta su internet: Perchè sono venuti ad ascoltarti in 800mila (a S. Giovanni?) e poi hanno votato solo in 30mila?
- Che minchia ti urli? che figura ci stai facendo fare davanti ai tuoi amati telespettatori della tv danese? 
  
Ho paura che Grillo, al contrario di Berlusconi, ci creda tantissimo alle cose che dice sul palco; immagino poi che qualcuno mi risponderà, ""eh però sempre meglio che votare VELTRUSCONI"" o ""Come fate a dire che farà schifo se non gli diamo neanche una possibilità"", quindi mi sa che inizio a sbattere la testa contro il muro ora che mi porto avanti.

A lot of Italian men seem to personify themselves with Berlusconi. Whether you hate or love him, you have got to respect the way he controlled Italy for almost a decade. Everybody knew he was a joke, though all italians want to *be* him.

I've got a lot of Italian friends (Florence area) who pose just as 'gangster' as Berlusconi. To them, it doesn't matter there's no real opposition, or that he has a lot of medium power (the 4th power, which I personally think is rather important).

Berlusconi is the man all Italian men aspire to be: rich, powerful, a lot of young girls, and relatively good looking for his old age.

From what I know, Italians aren't really rational (in general). They vote for the man they like the best, not what's best for their country.

* In a lot of states, passing on the right is legal. In Germany, it's illegal (exceptions being in traffic jams and slower moving lanes in the cities). When on the autobahn, always stay to the right. Use left lane only to pass.
* In a lot of states, turning right on a red light is legal. In Germany, it is illegal unless you see this [green arrow next to the stop light.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_720.svg)
*  The German driving law that trips up a lot of Americans is the ""right before left"" right-of-way law. When you come to an intersection, the driver to your right has the right-of-way over you. When you see this [sign](http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/12676251/2/stock-photo-12676251-vorfahrtsstrasse-priority-on-the-road-sign.jpg) or this [sign](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Norwegian-road-sign-210.0.svg/120px-Norwegian-road-sign-210.0.svg.png) then you have the right-of-way irregardless if traffic is coming in from the right. But if you do not see those signs, and there is no traffic light or stop sign controlling the intersection, you have to stop and wait if there is traffic coming from the right.
*  Speed cameras and red light cameras are everywhere in Germany. In California, for example, paying the ticket when you get caught by one of those is voluntary due to courts ruling that a live witness has to see your crime in order for a ticket to be enforceable. In Germany, that's not the case. If you get caught, you have to pay the fine and points are put against your license.
* Despite what many Americans think, not all of the autobahn is speed limit free. There are sections where the speed limit is 120k/h (or even lower). These are usually at major autobahn junctions, passing through major cities, hilly or curved road areas where visibility becomes an issue, or areas with frequent traffic jam issues. These areas are controlled with speed cameras and unmarked police cars (I've gotten pulled over by one of those before).

Aber ich denke, dass dieses System genauso ""kaputt"" ist wie die Privatsender und leiden unter grundlegenden Systemfehlern. Das ÖR-System hat immerhin noch einen minimalen Hauch seines Informations- und Bildungsauftrages und zieht somit etwas langsamer auf den Abgrund der kommerziell induzierten Anspruchslosigkeit zu, in dem schon der Großteil der privaten Sender hineingefallen sind. 
Aber ich denke die (nicht existente) Zukunft dieser Systeme zeichnet sich ohnehin schon ab.

That same public feeling dominates (part of) Italy since the early 1990s. Problem is, a very large part of the population thrives on the very same political/economical system that has been allegedly ""uncovered"" and ""dismantled"" in the early 1990s (Tangentopoli). What happened then was that the corruption system (used by all, and advantageous to all) became too expensive so all politicians were ""fired"", and replaced with new ones. This is a slightly personal interpretation. The official story may tell you that a bunch of brave public attorneys uncovered and dismantled the system, the public opinion raged, and everything was clean again.

Everyone proposes their own causes and cures for all this: libertarians argue this is all caused by the huge influence of the central administration on the economy; leftists shift the blame from the public servants to their bosses; people living in the North say it's because of the mobsters in the South; people living in the South argue that the North most benefits from corruption; almost everyone says it's genetics and we just can't behave like the Swedes do; and so on and so forth.",0,1361612813,null,0,false,0,c8k8d3w,t3_191j1a,t1_c8k8d3w,t1_c8k2qmb,null,1431381664,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

* Among voters, 35% are voting for Bersani and Vendola and 7% for Monti - putting them together, they're the ~30% of Italians: these are the people who realize (and probably have always realized) that the situation Italy is in is dire (and thus are aware of the pervasive corruption and so on), and don't want Berlusconi back, whether they're left-leaning or centre/right-leaning. They also believe populism is not a solution.

* Then we have 30% voting for Berlusconi and allies (basically the Northern League) - ~25% of all Italians: they're either people who would benefit from Berlusconi's laissez-faire tenure, strongly against heavy taxations (especially if rich), strongly against any kind of left-leaning party or clueless senior citizens. Either way, they put forward their own interests and not those of the whole country.

* 20% will vote for Grillo's ""fuck 'em all"" movement - ~15% of Italians: these are people who have had enough of not only Berlusconi, but also Monti's austerity and the left's weakness. Half of them are ex-left voters, half of them ex-Berlusconi voters. Prone to populism. It's hard to know what their stance on corruption is, since so far they have focused on lesser issues.

true,zakk,ITAL,Italy,"Italian here. It seems to me that many are missing the key point behind Berlusconi electoral victories. Sure he controls the media, but also his sex scandals had a very big resonance on TV and this may be a double-edged sword; sure other parties suck pretty badly, but it would be impossible to compete with mr. Berlusconi's party in this respect.

My personal point is that Italy is a country with many problems, but without any doubt the most important is that there is a huge presence of the State: lot of taxation (and by lots, I mean up to 55%) and lots of government spending (and by lots I mean that the taxes are barely enough to cover for those expenses).

In this situation Berlusconi has always spoken against taxation, against government spending. (Beware: he has spoken very much, but has done very little... I'm not supporting him!) On the other side the left-wing coalition never spoke clearly against those issues, and in this electoral campaign never denied clearly the possibility of introducing a ""patrimonial tax"" like in 1992 (i.e. the government took as a tax the 0.6% from every Italian bank account as an extraordinary measure)

People who agree with me, and deem the omnipresent government as the main problem of Italy, may vote for Berlusconi who, at least, swears that this time will solve the problems, rather than voting for people who are not even trying.

&gt; P2 was sometimes referred to as a ""state within a state"" or a ""shadow government"". The lodge had among its members prominent journalists, members of parliament, industrialists, and military leaders—including Silvio Berlusconi, who later became Prime Minister of Italy; the Savoy pretender to the Italian throne Victor Emmanuel; and the heads of all three Italian intelligence services (at the time SISDE, SISMI and CESIS). **When searching Licio Gelli's villa, the police found a document called the ""Plan for Democratic Rebirth"", which called for a consolidation of the media, suppression of trade unions, and the rewriting of the Italian Constitution.**

&gt; [...]

&gt; **The Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, headed by Anselmi, concluded that the P2 lodge was a secret criminal organization.**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licio_Gelli#2003_interview

&gt; In 2003, Gelli told La Repubblica that it seemed that **the P2 ""democratic rebirth plan"" was being implemented by Silvio Berlusconi**:

&gt; &gt; *Every morning I speak to my conscience and the dialogue calms me down. I look at the country, read the newspaper, and think: ""All is becoming a reality little by little, piece by piece. To be truthful, I should have had the copyright to it. Justice, TV, public order. I wrote about this thirty years ago... Berlusconi is an extraordinary man, a man of action. This is what Italy needs: not a man of words, but a man of action.*

&gt; He talked of many Italian politicians. Of Fabrizio Cicchitto he said he knew him well (è bravo, preparato - ""he's good and capable""). **With regard to Berlusconi's program for the reform of the judicial system, he boasted that this had been an integral part of his original project.** He also approved of Berlusconi's reorganization of TV networks.

* pre-WWII Romania was overwhelmingly rural. 85% of the people lived in villages.  By 1990, more than half lived in urban areas. The 1930s were very tough times for the peasants: they had very low living standards and many of them were constantly in debt and were threatened eviction from their houses by the banks.
* almost half of the Romanians were illiterate. In just 10 years in the 1950s, Romania officially stamped out illiteracy. Everyone who couldn't read (regardless of age) had to take literacy classes.
* higher education was expensive and just 1% of the population would complete higher education. After the communists took over, it was free and they encouraged the working class children to follow it.
* in the 1930s-40s, Romania had 15-20% child mortality due to easily preventable diseases. it was reduced by more than 90% in just 10-20 years.

But let me tell you my family's story:

My grandfather was born in a poor fisherman's family: eight people living in a two-room mud-brick hut on the Danube's shore, living off cornmeal polenta (mămăligă) with fried salted fish (saramură) they fished from the lakes along the river. He moved in Bucharest in the 1940s and worked as a tailor and, after the communists came, he was able to lead a confortable enough life. His two children (my father and my aunt) graduated higher education (engineering, economic studies). 

This would have definitely not been possible during the 1930s and even now it's not possible to pay for a four-people family's expenses and an apartment's rent/mortgage with the median wage [200€-300€], let alone with a minimum wage [160€].

true,liaisons_dangereuses,ITAL,Italy,"- He failed to build a solid european right wing in opposition to the populist right, joining a coalition with the catholic center and the new right (both leaded by old school politicians that have been allied with Berlusconi in the past), a group of outsiders that was never supposed to attract more than the 10% of votes.  
When it seamed possible, after Berlusconi's debacle, that italian right wing would renovate itself, Berlusconi retired his support to Monti's government, dissolved the primary elections that his party was supposed to held, and restored his alliance with anti-monti, xenophobic right. He then made a campaign completely targeted to idiots in order to win back his core supporters.  

- Monti was respected but not really popular: his austerity measures hit the country quite hard, plus he made some faux-pas (his pension reform left 300k over 50s without both a job and a pension). Populist politicians painted him as a puppet controlled by Merkel and the banks. His labour minister never missed an occasion to show herself as a cocky and unlikable university professor.  
Also, after he decided to run for prime minister, he tried to dump his respected image of cold and competent technician, alienating the electorate even more: the new Monti is now allied with two not so popular candidates, is making electoral promises and trying to paint himself as a man of solid family values; he appears absolutely uncomfortable in this role and is often unprepared on any political field that is outside is expertise.  

- Many former Monti supporters have probably chosen to vote for the democratic party for a simple reason: If they lose, Berlusconi is back.

I think the conflict is adequately covered in Western media, if you actually take the time to look beyond the nightly news. Seems like they want to be the story, rather than simply report on it.

They've been called out countless times, pressure's been put on them, but what exactly can one do that's within reach? How exactly would the policies of a country such as Sweden influence the fact that Israel thinks it's the sole sovereign of all of Palestine? 

Exactly shite all in terms of serious political pressure has been placed on Israel through legit diplomatic channels. The State Department gave in like wet chippy paper when Israel refused to renew the settlement freeze. ""Calling out"" is a meaningless gesture that Europe uses all to often to avoid making hard choices about what we will actually tolerate. 

So if we're taking Sweden as an example, they buy into all this EU-wide foreign policy, consensus building stuff. That would put them in the perfect position to try and build support among smaller EU countries to take a harder line against Israel. 

&gt;To even begin to make a dent in Israel's policies, you need to have lobbies strong enough to influence politicians in the States.

This is a pathetic cop-out. If the average European voter actually gave a shit about the Israel-Palestine conflict a few well-funded lobby groups would be powerless to prevent a change in policy. The man in the street doesn't care, and these so-called ""activists"" are more interested in voyeuristic conflict tourism than changing that.

 - 6 y.o. - pre-school class (optional)

 - 13 y.o. - gimnazjum (3 years)
 - 16 y.o. - high school (3 kinds to chose from - liceum/technikum/school of trade) (3 years)

Then you are 18 or 19, and you can end education there (to 18 y.o. education is mandatory). You can also take final exam (Matura), and go to university - Bachelors degree is 3 years, Masters is another 2 years. But it changed very recently, before few years there was only Masters, so almost everybody still go for the whole 5 years, cause people don't think about Bachelors degree as ""real"" higher education.

Education is free of charge (inluding university, if you can pass exam good enough to be admited to public university for ""dzienne"" (daily) course). I think about 1/2 to 1/3 students study on daily courses, but I don't have data for that.

If you got bad notes on the exam, or if you work and can't go to university during the day there are ""zaoczne""(during the weekends) and ""wieczorowe"" (during the evenings) courses on almost all universities, but these costs about 2000-8000 PLN (500-2000 Euro) each half of a year. There are also private universities, that have all their courses paid, and are considered second class education (cause you don't have to pass exam to study there).

At 24-25 y.o. you should graduate Masters, except for a few special studies, like medical for example, which take 6 years. On most courses you have to create and defend ""Masters thesis"" at the end of the course, and you can do that with delay - some people do that even a few years after they finished course.

true,anarchisto,ROMA,Romania,"&gt;  I'm sure that a self-governed, non-exploited country which could build its identity, economy and political class since the end of the war would be better off now.

Romania was a self-governed, non-exploited country between 1877 and 1947. It was supposed to be ""free"". In practice, our army would kill people at the drop of a hat. In 1907, the (literally) starving peasants began rioting. The army killed over 10,000 peasants; they used cannons against them. Whenever workers began striking, the army would shoot and kill them. 

If you were left-wing, you were fair game. Thousands of people were sent to prison just for being left-wingers. Owning certain books was a crime. The 1923 constitution banned executions in peacetime, with one exception: communists. If you were convicted to be a communist (having communist beliefs was enough), you could have been executed, though most were just convicted to forced hard labour for life.

I don't see one reason why the same kind of repression would have not continued.

&gt; you shouldn't assume that we wouldn't do it ourselves if we were able to.

But we *did* it ourselves. After 1958, we weren't doing what the Soviets said anymore. They wanted Romania to be an agricultural country, we refused and began industrialization.

Primary school:
From age 7 to 14 -&gt; primary school diploma you don't have to continue your education if you don't want to.

General test for all students(Native language + math) 

Depends on your scores you can choose 2 types of high school/work field that you want to go:

From age 15-18 -&gt; basic fields/profession such as auto-mechanics, barbers , merchants etc...
or
From age 15-19: more demanding fields such as technician(all kinds of medical/mechanic/computer ...)
or gymnasium(pretty much 4 more years of all kinds of basic knowledge)

General test(One or two subjects ,usually math, native language+history or some of basics science)

college from age 19 to 23 -&gt; college diploma( you can upgrade it if you can to master level or PhD, each take one or two years to finish)
college for medical doctors 19 - 25 -&gt; yay you're a doctor now!
college for dentists 19-24

and we have 

""Higher school"" (something like community college or maybe Bachelors degrees it can't be translated well) from age 18/19 to 22/23(fields are pretty much the same like in high school -&gt; than if you want you can go to ""real"" college or try to get a job.

Economists explain this by the fact that a government who knows the kind of industries it wants in its country can plan whole industrial chains at once without waiting for offer and demands to balance themselves out : decide where the steel factory, the coal and iron mines will be, and build them while making the roads between them. In the same time build cities for the miners and factory workers with shops and services. It is faster than just decide to build a factory somewhere and wait for the rest to happen through the laws of market.

Unfortunately, this is easy to do for well known industries, but innovative industries tend to have needs that change faster than central planners update.

Both. Right now they just pulled everything off the shelves.

The thing is: Poor shouldn't have to rely on being gifted food, in the first place. We have a social system in place for that. Unemployment payments are high enough for sustenance, (~370 Euros plus rent plus heating), if there's problems then it's because people get their dole cut (in 99.5% of the cases for spurious reasons), or because they're pensioners that get even less, in the first place. Another cause for people to take food aid is having kids, to save money for a halfway decent birthday present or such.

While in general the efforts of our food banks are laudable, collecting non-perished yet unsellable food from supermarkets etc. and distributing it, it's solving problems that shouldn't exist, in the first place.

The food banks flatly rejected the notion, btw. They're already destroying tons of foods when companies are abusing them as a free way to get rid of spoiled food, and they'd do the same with all that lasagne. They don't have the funds to test it all, or the storage to freeze it while that's going on, anyway.

Is this true?

No, this is not true. Anyone can do an internship (Praktikum), ""even"" someone with an M.A./M.Sc. 

However, it is a common advice to not do an internship after graduating, since you are now a very high qualified skilled labor. But in your case (non-native speaker) it might be better to do an internship instead of being jobless.

- 12-18: 6 years Highschool - mandatory until the age of 18. It has ~~three~~ four main clusters: general (sciences, economics, humanities), technical (office management, trade, tourism, electromechanics, etc.), arts, and profession (carpenting, metalworks, construction, etc.). 

- After that you can go to either University or a 'higher school' (pretty much community college), except those with a profession HS diploma have to take an extra year to be allowed. University focuses on academic educations, community colleges only have professional educations. Bachelor degree takes 3 years, Master usually one year, STEM fields and Law Master takes 2 years. Only Medicine takes 6 years total (has been lower the past years from 8 years, this is without specialization). 
The Bachelor you start with is usually the same as your Master. For instance you can start a Law/Economics Bachelor at age 18, get your Bachelor degree three years later and graduate two years later with a Master diploma. There are possibilities to change fields after getting your Bachelor, but it usually requires an extra year. Tuition is around €600/year.

Unfortunately, at this point, it seems unable to go forward.

Soviet-style communism works great for creating large corporations, factories and infrastructure. However, most inovation doesn't come from them, it comes from small businesses and that's what the Soviet system lacked.

I think an ideal system would be a two-tiered system, having large corporations centrally-planned, while the small and medium businesses to be independent and decentralized and everyone to be allowed to be an entrepreneur if they wished so.

There's no practical benefit that I see here.

On the other hand, there are some very significant dangers, most notably: The fact that a huge number of people don't speak English, and aren't going to learn within their lifetime, would create a massive divide between the ruling multilingual elite (that's me, technically…) and the non-English-speaking masses, deepening the EU's already very grave ""democratic deficit"", as they say.

&gt; However, pushing formalities aside, the award-winning actress continued with a scathing criticism of austerity policies that came straight from the heart. She recounted how before being cast for the lead role in Cesc Gay’s “Una pistola en cada mano” (A Gun in Each Hand), she had been out of work for three years.

&gt; “In those three years I watched my father die in a public hospital where there were no blankets to cover him with, no water for him to drink; we had to bring it ourselves,” said Peña.

&gt; “In those three years when I was out of work, I gave birth and I do not know what kind of public education my child has to look forward to. In those three years without work I saw people die because they had no home,” the actress told her audience.

&gt; “This is why no one can sully the joy of this night for me. Standing here, I am asking for work. I have a child to raise. Thank you,” Peña ended.

I was a kid, but I remember that before then we had TV channels who tried to entertain but also keep a minimum level of 'culture' and engagement. We had 'serious' documentaries and talk shows focusing on divisive topics or political issues - I loved the science documentaries of 'Quark' for example, thanks to my parents enjoying them with me and explaining stuff.

Berlusconi's TVs turned the tables: mostly shows devoid of any content apart from dancing girls and silly scripts. Mini-starlets were generated continuosly, so lots of girls had the dream of getting in there. There message was ""hey, studying is for losers, come here and have fun and be famous!"". I'll mention the name ""Uomini e donne"" shuddering (a gym rat guy sitting on a LITERAL THRONE as several girls had to woo him so he could pick one - the 'courtship' would last weeks and the various characters would make the rounds of all TV channels being interviewed as bringers of Important Truths. They would earn lots of money just by touring around and posing - how can you convince a kid that it's worthwhile to pursue an education when they see that?) 
 
Once he got in charge he also had control of the 3 state channels and pretty much all became the same. The most blatant example was the news program of Rai1, the leading and most respected state channel, which started devoting half of its time to issues like how to solve your dog's digestion problems or what will StupidBimbo24 wear for her marriage - it truly became a parody of a news program.

I'm not saying that it's all his fault, as of course there must have been a receptive audience for that to work, but he created and exploited a kind of 'perfect resonance' and we now have the harvest: lots of people who don't appreciate culture, don't read books and have trouble understanding non-basic written texts, ready to follow who shouts louder and that forget what happened two days after they stop seeing it.

I might seem to be exaggerating, but I have a friend that works as a tutor in a school to prepare people for the national lawyers state exam.

&gt; In 1999 the entire European Commission had resigned when, thanks not least to a Commission whistleblower, Paul van Buitinen, every kind of fraud and corruption had come to light. Miss Andreasen – who was born to a Danish father, lived in Spain and had worked for various multi-national organisations – began her new job as something of a ""European"" idealist, hoping she could help to put things right.

&gt; As soon as she arrived, she was invited to meet the Court of Auditors. They welcomed her and expressed the hope that she could impose order on chaos, but warned that she would meet stiff opposition, not least from the powerful Frenchman who for years had been in charge of the EU budget. (Although her book changes officials' names for legal reasons, he is identifiable without much difficulty as Jean-Paul Mingassen.)

&gt; As soon as Miss Andreasen began looking at the EU's accounting system, she saw that it was a shambles. Between the 2000 and 2001 accounts, €200 million had gone missing without explanation. She was told these were ""loans"" which had been â written off'. Senior officials were authorised to hand out huge sums without any proper records being kept. Accounts were kept on spreadsheets which could be accessed and changed without leaving any trace of who made the changes.

&gt; The system was open to fraud in every direction. Almost immediately, however, Miss Andreasen found herself being pressured to sign off the 2001 accounts which, as she said, would be a criminal offence, since this was the responsibility of her predecessor and she had been given none of the information needed to know whether or not they were correct.

He says some true things about stuff that doesn't work in Italy, and some of his proposals are indeed good, but everything is mixed with a huge amount of nonsensical crap and stupidity. He denied the existence of AIDS and supported many conspiracy theories, he promises a referendum in order to leave the eurozone (incompatible with our constitution), his agenda on economy can be described as naive if we want to be kind. (yesterday he talked about covering the costs of his policies by retroactively imposing to the parties the restitution of the public foundlings they received in the past). He made xenophobic and pro-mafia statements.  

He promotes a direct democracy approach but only 30 thousand people voted in his party primary elections (he's supposed to get the 17-20% of votes, on sunday), with the result that they will send to the parliament people elected with only few hundreds of votes each (86 for the molise region, you can't even get elect in an high school student council with that).  
    
His propaganda is indeed fascism inspired: huge cult of personality and continuos appointment of enemies of the movement that need to be destroyed by them. Not only the political parties (thieves and parasites), but also our president of the republic (senile idiot), a famous oncologist (cancer spreader), the workers' unions (to be abolished) and all the press (criminals). He keeps suggesting conspiracies about hidden powers controlling Italy and trying to stop them. His followers act in cult like fashion and attack everyone who's mildly critical to the movement, and they overpower every comment section of major websites and online newspapers (it's been found out that they used the help of a media agency for that). He threw out of the movement elected candidates when they questioned his behavior. He never went on tv avoiding to answer journalists' questions and controls the movement political agenda by making statements on a blog. he's guided by the hand of his shady publicist.

* Junior Cycle : 12-15 years old. Ends in mandatory Junior Certificate exam, some people leave school after this to start in a trade.

* Transition Year: 15-16 years old. Some schools have this, some don't, in some it's optional in some it's mandatory. Studies in normal subjects (languages, maths, sciences, humanities, etc) are continued, but not as much emphasis is placed on the end of year exams. Usually has social and cultural enrichment programmes. Many include one or more work-placement schemes that last for a couple weeks.
* Senior Cycle: 15/16-18/19 years old depending on transition year. Ends in the Senior Certificate exams in which students take a minimum of 6 subjects. Mandatory subjects in this are: English language, Mathematics, Irish language (this can be waived for foreigners or cases of severe dyslexia or learning difficulties). Students choose the other subjects based on what their school offers, typically:  Modern Languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian - other languages such as Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese etc can also be taken but the level at which they are taught can vary. For example I took Japanese which was only taught to a basic degree but others such as Arabic are typically only for students who grew up with it and are to a higher standard), Sciences (Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Geography), Social (History, Home Economics, Religious Education), Business (Business, Accounting, Economics), Art (Art, Music, Design), Practical (Construction Studies, Engineering, Technology). 

In the Irish education system, the results from the Leaving Certificate form a points system which determines placement in a third-level course. In this, each grade is assigned a number of points and the top six scoring subjects are summed. Extra points are given for taking the Leaving Certificate through Irish (as in, all the questions are asked through Irish) and I believe there are extra points for taking honours level Mathematics).

You apply to a number of courses in different colleges before taking the Senior Certificate exams, and are offered places depending on your points, the minimum requisite number of points for the course you applied for and the number of places available in the course. Some courses are pretty competitive to get into as they have high demand so the number of points to gain entry is pretty high. For example, to study Medicine in university in Ireland you typically need 580+ points, which means you need at least 5 A+ grades at honours level. 

**Third-Level**:  Begins at 17-20 years old, depends on whether you took Transition Year or had a year break after the Senior Certificate exams. 

Most courses are 3 years but quite a few are 4, and you can always 'extend' your stay in college by 'selectively failing' some courses which usually requires repeating a semester or two.  

University fees are subsidized by the government so it's relatively cheap to attend university in comparison to say, the U.S, but these have been rising. This year it cost about €2,500 to attend and that's set to go up to €3,000 by 2015.

Rimangono PD e SEL, che sono partiti tutt'altro che perfetti, che a seconda dei numeri che prendono potrebbero garantire un periodo di instabilità dannosissima, ma che a mio avviso *forse* potrebbero combinare qualcosa di buono se le camere non saranno in stallo. Voterei in particolare SEL perché, nonostante abbia aspetti che non mi piacciono (per esempio il fatto che sia un partito personalistico, un po' confuso e spesso anche un po' populista) spero che possa equilibrare un possibile futuro governo un po' più a sinistra, che possa costringere la coalizione a considerare maggiormente i diritti sociali e civili.

Poi magari mi sbaglio e finisce tutto in caciara tipo Prodi 2006 (anche perché la legge elettorale, che rende il parlamento ingovernabile a meno di non avere percentuali altissime -- legge voluta dal precedente governo Berlusconi proprio per cercare di far fare una pessima figura al governo di csx che l'avrebbe seguito -- è sempre la stessa) o peggio, ma questo è il ragionamento che farei e questi sono i rischi che mi assumerei.

true,esteemed,null,null,"MUCHAS GRACIAS!! This is all fantastic advice! So nice to hear it from someone who lives there!

&gt;1st. Make sure you have NOW accommodation for Fallas. City population doubles in Fallas and Hotels and Hostals are full. 

We booked our hotel for Valencia last night (prices are high and hotels are filling up already!). We'll be staying at a nice hotel about 1km away from Plaza del Ayuntamiento.

&gt;2nd. Valencia's Aquarium is one of the bests, and there is queues for it's tickets. I've been in San Diego's, Barcelona's and one in Holland. And Valencia's is only second to that in San Diego. If you get tickets for the aquarium, get tickets for the IMAX (Hemisferic), as it's cheaper this way. And go to the Mall ""El Saler"", which is nearby, for lunch. Overall, do not miss the Dolphins Show.

We live in Long Beach, California which has its own little aquarium, and we have also been to Sea World in San Diego, and the Oceanogràfic looks just as good. The architecture alone looks amazing! We'll be sure to try to buy our tickets in advance to avoid the queues. And we won't miss the dolphin show!

&gt;3rd Valencia is a very safe city. Still, you are a tourist, and a prime target for scammers and pick pockets. Avoid to look tourist (sandals with socks, rly, rly?) and keep your belongs under watch, and so on.

Haha! I think it's just old people who wear socks with their sandals. I've never understood it! (Also, the weather looks like it'll be in the 50's-60's (10s-15s celsius?), so it will definitely be too cold for sandals anyway!)

&gt;4th Watch your drink. It is quite easy to overdrink in Fallas. Drinking is good, but overdrinking makes you lost the fun.

We're not very big drinkers, but we may get caught up in the moment. Very good advice! Thanks!

&gt;5th Taxis are not expensive and do not usually cheat. A normal run should be around 8 to 10 euros, maybe 12. If it is more, ask for a receipt or call the police. As I said, it is not normal to be cheated, all I'm giving you is precautions just in case.

Very good to know! I had not thought of this possibility! Would you recommend taxis instead of the Metro? We were planning on using the Metro mostly.

&gt;6th Paella. Paella is the traditional food of Valencia. Still, in the city you will probably fall for tourist traps. If you want to try the real paella and not a tourist trap, look for one of the following restaurants: Pa, Sal i Oli; El Rall; La Pepica; L'estimat; El Yuso; Bill should be around 20€ per person.

Thank you!!

&gt;7th Agua de Valencia or Valencia's Water. It is a drink mix of Cava, Orange Juice, Vodka and Gin. Best place ever is Los Borgia, in Caballeros Street.

Cool!

&gt;8th Café Bombón. Is a presentation of coffee tipical of Valencia, with condensed milk.

Adding it to the list!

&gt;9th Place to buy food: Mercadona supermarkets. By far, best prices and quality.

Adding it to the list!

&gt;10th Watching Fallas. Do not wait to the 19th of March, as the 19th of March Fallas will be break down for burning. Get confy shoes and be ready for hours of walking and queing. And watch for pick pocketers.

We'll spend most of the day the 18th of March walking around the city. Do you think we'll get to see them intact?

&gt;11th Fireworks and Firecrackers. Beginning the 1st of March, there will be a huge Firecrackers show (Mascletà) every day at 13:00 in the Hall Square (Plaza del Ayuntamiento). Also, beginning the 12th of March, there will be a big Fireworks show every night at 12:00 in the Old River.

Thanks!

&gt;12th The Old River and the New River Turia. In 1956, for the last time the river Turia flooded the city. As it has happened periodically since the Romans founded the city the year 138 BC, it was decided to make a HUGE civil construction work and make a new way for the river. If you are an engineer or into civil works is worth to watch. The old one became a garden, very nice to walk, 4 km long in the city, 12 km long upriver.

That is AWESOME! Such an interesting aspect to the city. Valencia is quickly becoming my favorite part of this trip!

&gt;13th Orchata or Orxata or wathever. It is a sweet drink, quite a milk shake. Worth to try.

I've had something similar here. The mexicans call it ""Horchata""... like a sweet milk drink? It's pretty good, but I'll bet yours is better!


&gt;Beside Fallas, you have a 2000 old city to watch: Serranos Towers, La Lonja (a XIV Century Gothic Building Stock Exchange), the Roman Forum, Pius V art museum, Ceramic Museum, the University, the Aquarium, the BEACH and Sail Port...

Independence would be *very* costly, and, given the population disparity, the cost would likely fall mostly on the English who aren't being consulted.

And questions like are they British or Scottish lords? Do Scots in rUK get treated as non-EU nationals until that's sorted? etc. Are all big questions.

While Scotland broadly sits to the left of rUK, you could say that about a number of UK regions, such as Manchester (the cities of the north in general), and taking of Mancunian Independence is simply absurd to most folk.

Last I checked, the English were more in favor of independence because it's easy to portray Scotland as living fat of the taxes the rest of the UK pays.

Option 1:

They are religious nuts. You're pretty much fucked if you're not a muslim. Expect 5 times a day prayers, halal food (no pork, no alcohol etc.), mother stays at home and spend most of the time watching TV or meeting other women, evenings are spent watching TV or hanging out with other couples. They will talk turkish at home. 

Option 2:

The family is secular/not practicing the religion/member of a islamic sect/branch. These people don't care about Islam and its rules, many of them consume pork and alcohol, they tend to be very open minded. More like the western society. Again TV.

IMHO these are the two options that you will encounter, but some things all turkish people have in common:

- football is the real religion, the Istanbul (Galatasaray, Besiktas, Faggotbahce) derbies are important events, maybe you will inform yourself about turkish football before joining them

- turkish food is fucking delicious and döner is not even common in Turkey

- The husband is the ""boss"", the wife is(!) the boss. She will make herself clear when no one is watching.

The fact that they invite strangers to their house tells me that they are open minded and you will not experience a culture shock, I guess the smaller things in life will make the difference.

My father cracked inappropriate ""jokes"" and my mother just kind of ignored it (which, at that time and place was pretty ""liberal"" of her).

The Muslims being prosecuted makes me sad.

For the actions of a few psychotic ""Muslims"", a shitload of normal British Muslims are gonna face yet more racism and persecution and be blamed for all of the UK's problems. These suicide bombers should be labelled as psychopaths and nothing else, simple as that.

I have no opinion on Scotland's independence, except that I hope Scotland does what's best for them. I have strong Scottish roots though so I may be a bit biased. I actually would like Scotland to stay in the union, but if they feel differently then I won't object to it. My knowledge on it is a bit limited.

I think UK gun control is important, we need to keep a tight control over guns. This is said despite the fact that I love guns and go skeet shooting whenever I can. I'd have a million guns if I could, but I also wouldn't like to see psychotic school shootings happening over here.

I'm pro gay marriage, but I also think marriage should be a personal decision, not one that's even controlled by churches, let alone the government. If two people want to consider themselves married, that should be a decision made only by them.

On the other hand it's going to increase the cost of labour inside your borders (for a number of reasons, e.g. more people employed) and there will be even less reasons to invest, not without some kind of trade barrier. 

Let me give it another spin; what we have is an overproduction crisis. If you start building stuff in order to get out of the crisis you will hurt the bottom line of certain individuals by making labour more expensive and thus giving them even less reasons to invest. 

This creates an impossible situation. In order to restart the capitalist game, people need to invest, but as it makes no sense to invest (not in bulk that is) and if the state intervenes it will make it even less so. That leaves only the option of making labour really cheap, which isn't really an option (as nobody can now buy anything), but its effects are more long-term. 

In 5-10 years I think Europe will be ready to ask the question if the bottom line of certain individuals is worth everything.  Until then enjoy the ride.

Whereas if the problem is supply-side, the money will be spent competing to purchase assets, raising prices. Printing money when there's a supply-side problem, and getting no inflation, does not work.

* You say that increasing money in people's pockets will both increase and decrease likelihood to invest. In order to do this, you are making contradictory assumptions, first the the problem is a lack of demand (low wages and low consumption), then the problem is supply-side (lack of competitiveness).

So, for instance, housing price inflation in London makes a worker require higher wages to survive, which means that London becomes less attractive for labour intensive investment.

* Second, inflation due to printing money, and an increase in the money supply, leading to a nominal rise in wages, but accompanied by a simultaneous devaluation of the currency, making domestic wages lower relative to wages denominated in a different currency. Thus increasing competitiveness.

Part of our (Australia's) fiscal stimulus in response to the GFC was to build a national broadband network (the NBN), which brings a fibre-optic cable into every\* house and business in the country.

It's awesome, and everyone who's been connected so far (it's still under construction), is really damned happy with it.

But in general, our country can speak to the absolute success of fiscal stimulus as an economic measure. We had a lucky mix of things going on:

1. Really good financial regulation
2. *Textbook* Keynesian fiscal stimulus - we weren't afraid to go into a bit of debt to do it either\**. 
3. Continued demand for our resources from Asia

On (1), we have all sorts of ""automatic stabilisers"" which each look after a particular facet of the economy. The Reserve Bank handles monetary policy (interest rates), the [ACCC](http://www.accc.gov.au) enforces business regulation and competition, [APRA](http://www.apra.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx) regulates the banks, [ASIC](http://www.asic.gov.au) regulates investment activity, etc, etc... This is all really good stuff, and it looks like some of the southern European economies would benefit from putting regulators like this in place to improve the stability, reliability, and performance of their economies.

On (2), the stimulus combined immediate-term measures (the gov't literally gave $900.00 to every taxpayer - a cash handout), medium-term measures (built a whole bunch of school infrastructure, public works, etc.), and long-term measures (the NBN, the carbon trading system). This is the *opposite* of austerity, and without this, our economy would have tanked, just like in Europe. I can't believe that ""austerity"" is even a thing. What the actual fuck, Europe? Please kick out any politicians that advocate austerity - they don't know what they're doing and are destroying your economy. Which is bad for everyone.

On (3), this is an external factor - we got lucky. But still, Europe has a hell of a lot to offer the world, and if you concentrate on delivering the things that only Europeans can, you'll do well. My only suggestion here is that Asia and South America is booming - get on that. Start selling them everything you can.

And finally, please fix your economy in the next couple of months! I'm coming to visit for a few years, and I need a job while I'm there to view your beautiful continent! &lt;3

1- I'll try to write this in english, but as much as I'll try, I'll never be able to be even close to give my words the perfect meaning, try to understand what I'm saying beyond the particular word.

2- In this, and many other matters, people tend to take and absolute position. From where I'm looking at the world, I cannot see black or white spots, just an infinite gamma of shades of grey. 

3- I took my time to search and read and form my opinion on this matter as on many others of italian history, but I'm not an historian and what I think today is not the same I used to think 10 years ago, I'm here to expose my view, happy to confront it with yours.


Let's start....

Ok...

well.  ehm...

you know... Italy.. the italians... 
you know, Italy is where italians live.... but.. ehm.. Italy is where italians live, but what's an italian? what makes a person to be called italian? what makes a person a member of a nation, and why is there a different word for nation and country? well, it would seem that a country is a geographic connotation given to a territory for government while a nation is a group of people who shares tradition, language and most generally a social identity to which the members feels to belong.

Members of a nation share the proud of the accomplishments and successes and feel the need to protect each others. It's like an enlargement of the concept of tribe. 

This feeeling, commonly called ""nationalism"" in the past, can bring to a various gamma of results; Many of them are bound to the inner parochialism/localism/sectionalism and can bring to racism (cultural, religious, etc..) as they respond to the basic instinct to defend the group we're in. (I think human kind has taken a leap into the era of society without waiting for its instinct to adapt and many are unfitted to this level of socialization.  We must fight them with the power of critic thought and rationalism.) But many results are positive since they give people a sense of identity and promote collaboration and progress.

If we can look at Japan to find maybe the most powerful nationalism, it's clear to the eyes of anyone that even other nations like France or Spain has a lot more nationalism than Italy.

Italy never had that kind unity, we always have been divided, our dialects reflect this as they are very likely completely different languages. Italy has always been divided in small little states and this had a huge impact on the way of living of italians and the formation of the italian identity. We lived separeted in small groups for such a long time that we lost almost completely our sense of identity (if we ever have had one). People learnt to think only to the strict group of beloved and not much beyond that point.

This way of living entered in the minds and hearts of the italians more that  we would care to admit to ourselves. 

This is one of the why south could degenerate in a pseudo-feudal form till the 1800, based of favours, connections, and so on..
In the 19th century Italy was still very divided with dominations from other countries, and when the Garibaldi's expedition started it was not driven by a national sense of identity from north to south, but more like an idea shared by few.

The south never wanted Garibaldi to come and in many occasion it took the chance to prove that they(the people) saw it as an invasion.

Obviously, behind the ideas of those few, there were economic interest from the reign of Piemonte, who, for sure would never enter a war for the sake of a nation who doesn't exist if not in the minds of few enlighten people. 

So, now we have the reign of Piemonte who extends his domain to the south but without any interest in its own development and a south a little (to medium) behind in development.

Here we have to remember the italian.

the italian who look only to his little world, very often at the expense of whoever is outside his circle of protected.

South: ruled and lived by localism, trying to eat/steal wherever they can to ensure the welfare of their little world. (and most often from ""public"" founds or resources)

Piemonte: don't care of South, try to drain what they can (in addition of the shared habit of stealing from ""public"" resources)

And while the north, thanks to the more advanced production (and industry) could keep up with the amount of resources consumed annualy by corruption and therefore accomodate a development though the following years, the south never had this chance. It came from a situation where almost the total of production came from the primary sector and was based on the pseudo-feudal model. There was no chance that the south could emerge form there with the help of those said ""italians"" carachteristics. South took another way, the distance between the two world increased with time and the more the distance, the less the efforts and more the corruption: where you don't see a way for everybody, you try to grant welfare to your little world, at the expense of the others and everything degenerate in a vicious cycle.

And... hahahaha, why da fuck are you still reading this?? hahaha

However, I think italians never learnt collaboration. Our most dispicable difect is ""l'arte di arragiarsi"" horribly translated as ""the art of fend"" but is the most powerful symbol of the italian ready to do everything to grant welfare to his little wordl, no matter if this is right or wrong without ever looking to the bigger picture. (E.g. If every italian would pay the taxes he is due, the amount of taxes could easily go down 50-70%, the services would be better, etc..[just an example do not focus on this, I had to make one, I have thousands I keep to myself])

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"I think nearly everyone recognizes that there is a democratic deficit in the EU that needs to be resolved.

The Parliament needs the power of legislative initiative.

The European Council needs to have its power scaled back, since it is too secretive and has largely sidelined the Commission. Any decisions it makes must be subject to parliamentary approval. Additionally, the President of the European Council should be an elected individual, not unlike the presidents of many EU countries. His post should be more ceremonial than not, representing the direction the European people would like to choose.

The Commission should be a government identical to that in a parliamentary system. The President and the Commissioners should be outgrowths of the Parliament.

The Council of Ministers should be an elected upper body, somewhere in between proportional representation and equal representation, perhaps similar to the Bundesrat.

Unfortunately, most of these changes are federal in nature, and unlikely to happen as long as states fight to keep intergovernmentalism a strong force in European government. What most people fail to forget is that it is their national governments who are the largest obstacle to a more democratic EU. As long as they insist on intergovernmentalism, the EU will always have a democratic deficit. A more clearly defined federal structure makes it far easier to implement democratic reforms.

Did you declare independence? Maybe I'm remembering this wrong, but I thought your parliament just said that you had the right to be sovereign if you wanted to. There's a difference between asserting that you are a sovereign entity and asserting that you are no longer a part of Spain. It does not seem to me that the Catalan parliament said the latter. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

&gt; Spain has the world record of countries that have gained independence from her. 3 or 4 more countries to list won't be anything new for them. 

I think the Russians might actually have the Spanish beat for number of countries that split off from them, but it's a pretty close race. And anyway, this time it's different. It's not some colony on the other side of the world: it's a territory on the Iberian peninsular that's been a part of Spain for half a millennium. It's certainly a different situation than Argentina getting independence, and it's understandable that the Spanish might push back more against this.

How  is that curious?  Sweden is, compared to the EU and some other European countries rather non-corrupt. Handing over more power to politicians from there, or to the EU, means that politicians, who statistically at least, are more corrupt are going to make decisions for my country. Also, I have no doubt in my mind (which we can also see in the negotiations) that what they really want, is more money. Not more of what is really best for Sweden, and/or even for the EU, they want more money,  - and what is happening with those money? Things Sweden want, like more research, more infrastructure, not moving the parlament, etc are even being cut. Why would we want more of that sort of politics?

EDIT : I apparently can't reply to myself on Alien Blue, so here's the info on the Wallis and Neuchâtel elections:

Wallis : The Christian Democratic Party is historically strong in this catholic canton, and will keep 3 of the 5 seats in the govt. The Socialist Party will keep its one seat. The battle is mainly for control of the fifth seat, between the Liberal-Radical Party (centre-right) candidate Christian Varone, who was the commander of the cantonal police, and who oversaw the rescue of the Sierre accident, and the Swiss People's Party (populist right) candidate Oskar Freysinger, who is famous as the main campaigner for the anti-minaret initiative.

Varone and Freysinger can't both be elected, since they come from the same town and the Walliser electoral law forbids that.
Varone is also in trouble in Turkey, because he (allegedly) stole some ruin of a column from there. However, the Walliser have the kind of mentality that makes such a person more popular.

Neuchatel is slightly more calm, but the main news is that charismatic SPP candidate Yvan Perrin (another former police commander) was transported to the hospital in the middle of the campaign, reportedly for stress. He then had to answer allegations that he was an alcoholic (a pet peeve of that canton, the former mayor of Neuchatel (city) was a notorious alcoholic)

EDIT #2 (I can't believe I forgot this)
We have three votations upcoming :
One wants to give more power to the shareholders about the salaries of business leaders. It was already polling quite favourably when Daniel Vasella, president of one of the largest Swiss firms, chose to give himself a 62 million frank golden parachute. He then renounced to it in the midst of an enormous scandal, and the initiative shot up in the polls
Second vote : the LAT, or law on the allocation of terrain. It's a rather technical issue, with its proponents saying it will preserve the countryside and allow better managed cities, while the opponents say it will make rent go up and will transform the countryside into a museum for city dwellers
Third vote : the constitutional article on the family. Basically it's just because music and children are already in the Constitution, so some people thought it was a shame that the family wasn't in it. It will be accepted by a wide margin, but the SPP campaigns against it, saying it's the first step towards a communist society where the children are managed by the state.

So each capitalist, individually, has every incentive to pay less. On the whole however, if everyone spends less, it creates a underconsumption crisis. Underconsumption is just a result of overproduction, not the root cause, and it just reinforces the spiral. 

UK for example has printed now 320Billion Pounds, and the inflation is quite reasonable. This is because, unless driving DIRECT investment, any money that hits the market will just be hoarded. 

The usual way of getting out of a crisis like this is war. It destroys values, thus making the whole capitalist engine run again. I don't think there are enough tensions now or any incentive for another world war, thus the spiral must continue. 

Another alternative is for some people to accept some loses, as I said previously. There is no historical precedent for this, and I doubt it will happen this time.

1) Problem with justice? Bullshit. He is just a victim of persecution of the left wing Judges. Look how much ex-Judges there are in the left wing of the parlament. He had a lot of proceeding, but he NEVER found guilty for anything. This is just a political issue and we should stop to waste public money for this.

2)The media? He may own some tv channels, but nonetheless most of the media are againist Berlusconi. De Benedetti (he is old bitter enemy) owns a bigger media empire, most of the newspaper are againist him, the main media events of the year (es.: festival of Sanremo) typically are againist him, there are comedians (es.:Benigni, Crozza, etc..) and journalists (Santoro, Travaglio, etc...) who made a fortune just because they are againist him (and they are also very famous just because of this), even in the show schedule of his 3 tv channel you can find very different journalists and opinin leaders with a wide variety of points of view: you can't say they are all supporter of Berlusoconi (actually few of them are). Didn't you remember how Berlusconi was badly pictured by ALL the media just 6-7 months ago? Stop sayng that Berlusconi is voted because he can influence the media!

3) the italian politic was even worse before Berlusconi: governments were much more instable and also after the election you couldn't know which prime minister would have been elected. With Berlusconi this changed and he made the italian democracy a little more modern. He was one the best enterpreuner we have ever had and he is one the few modern politician in Italy, all the other would bring back the old politic.

4) Taxes. Berlusconi want to keep taxes at minimun, he had some difficulties to do this in the past, but also he had several  success and he is the only one who is talking about this issue. Monti and the left wings know how to lead Italy just by raising taxes.

5)  Promises. He respect them.

It is really difficult to answer your question. There are many problems in Slovak education system (it is a subject of pretty heated public debate for a long time now) and I don't see into it well enough to give you a well-thought, compressed opinion. There have been many (conflicting and contradicting) tries to change the curricula (done rather unprofessionally - there is always lack of textbooks and other materials, because the changes are poorly timed and too often), high school final exams (""maturita"" - I think you call it Abitur (?)) and so forth in recent years. Thankfully, the worst of it missed me. In addition to chaotic changes with no long-term plan the biggest problem of our education system is that it's chronically underfinanced (affecting both teacher salaries and infrastructure). 

As for the quality of education - universities in Slovakia aren't really very good (I think that might be a heritage of communist rule, where the emphasis was given on elementary and apprentice or trade schools and higher education was sort of left adrift and there wasn't really much tradition to build upon after in Slovakia). Many people (including me) go to study abroad - mostly to Czech Republic - Slovak citizens have the same status in Czech academia as locals.

Other thoughts - I think that if you don't go to ""gymnázium"" you are forced to choose your qualification (by choosing your high school) way too early. On the other hand, when you finish gymnázium, you practically have to go to college, because without it you aren't really qualified for anything. Another thing - it is true, that the education process itself is heavily based on memorizing lots of (often useless) trivia without interdisciplinary context and such - it might give you a basic insight in lots of things, but it doesn't really prepare you for real life usage of that knowledge. I think the system as it is was designed 200 years ago to produce qualified labourers and is in a way obsolete now.

1km! that's perfect!

&gt;We live in Long Beach, California which has its own little aquarium, and we have also been to Sea World in San Diego, and the Oceanogràfic looks just as good. The architecture alone looks amazing! We'll be sure to try to buy our tickets in advance to avoid the queues. And we won't miss the dolphin show!

BTW, you can expend easily a day just watching the Oceanographic, check your schedule!

&gt;Very good to know! I had not thought of this possibility! Would you recommend taxis instead of the Metro? We were planning on using the Metro mostly.

Yes, metro is better, I was telling you just in case. Actually, maybe a Valencia Tourist Card might interest you:

http://www.valenciatouristcard.com/en/faq

Still, being in a so centric hotel, you varelly will need to use the public transport.

&gt;We'll spend most of the day the 18th of March walking around the city. Do you think we'll get to see them intact?

The 18th is a perfect day to watch Fallas. But start early (if you can) because it will be crowded. And bring water with yourself to avoid dehidration if the weather is fair.

----

The following are not my points of view but [...] this is how a supporter of Berlusconi would answer your question. I don't like the ""italy votes berlusconi because brainless zombies"" version of the story, it's biased and kind of unfair. I think you don't have the big picture untill you don't understand also this unpopular point of view.

1) Problem with justice? Bullshit. He is just a victim of persecution of the left wing Judges. Look how much ex-Judges there are in the left wing of the parlament. He had a lot of proceeding, but he NEVER found guilty for anything. This is just a political issue and we should stop to waste public money for this.

2)The media? He may own some tv channels, but nonetheless most of the media are againist Berlusconi. De Benedetti (he is old bitter enemy) owns a bigger media empire, most of the newspaper are againist him, the main media events of the year (es.: festival of Sanremo) typically are againist him, there are comedians (es.:Benigni, Crozza, etc..) and journalists (Santoro, Travaglio, etc...) who made a fortune just because they are againist him (and they are also very famous just because of this), even in the show schedule of his 3 tv channel you can find very different journalists and opinin leaders with a wide variety of point of view: you can't say they are all supporter of Berlusoconi (actually few of them are). Didn't you remember how Berlusconi was badly pictured by ALL the media just 6-7 months ago? Stop sayng that Berlusconi is voted because he can influence the media!

3) the italian politic was even worse before Berlusconi: governments were much more instable and also after the election you couldn't know which prime minister would have been elected. With Berlusconi this changed and he made the italian democracy a little more modern. He was one the best enterpreuner we have ever had and he is one the few modern politician in Italy, all the other would bring back the old politic.

4) Taxes. Berlusconi want to keep taxes at minimun, he had some difficulties to do this in the past, but also he had several success and he is the only one who is talking about this issue. Monti and the left wings know how to lead Italy just by raising taxes.

5) Promises. He respect them.",0,1361701885,null,0,false,0,c8kqkgt,t3_191j1a,t1_c8kqkgt,t3_191j1a,null,1431390461,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Slovenia:

* Nepotism. Last week the anticorruption commission published report about employment of PM daughter and a son of another prominent ruling cult politician in a state-owned company. As expected: clear case of nepotism. 

* Early elections, again (the last were held in 2011): when, how, will anything change?

true,ludovicovan,null,null,"i'm from italy, and, while i agree wit this, i found there's another big reason:
the average italian **is** just like berlusconi.

i mean, the average italian is egoistical, it only thinks and acts according to his own interest (not even his own interest in the long term, he only thinks to his short-term interest).

the average italian does something in the common interest only if he will have some personal (or familiar) advantage

the average italian will do something against the law every time he has the possibility and will be sure to not have any legal conseguence from his act (e.g. he will not pay taxes if he can)

he will only vote for the party which will give him material gain in the short-term interest (see the IMU tax)

when having an important public role in the society like a policeman or a deputy or a professional (architect, engineer, ...),  he will have little or no sense of the public good at all and will go after his personal interest or familiar interest (nepotism)

in short, he will often act according to what Banfield called ""ethos of amoral familism"": always assume that everyone will go after his ""familiar"" interest and do the same. This, i think, is mainly because of historical causes and also as a reaction to the massive corruption he confronts everyday with.

i know this is a rather pessimistic view, and i know that this only applies to the lower and little educated class, and this is fortunately changing, but i think a lot of this still applies, and it is the main reason for berlusconi's success


Other reasons include:

* control of the media
* many italians will not vote for left parties no matter who leads the right party
* berlusconi is very clever to understand what the italians want: just compare what he says today with what he said and promised in 1994 (strong anti-corruption laws, an honest leading class, ... Of course he did so just because it was immediately after ""Mani Pulite"")
* his opponents sucks and have many interests in common with him (maybe not directly, but still...)

i really hope i am wrong. Tomorrow we will know...

*di Walter D'Amario*

I parlamentari di Grillo prenderanno meno degli altri, ma tra i rimborsi e il resto si porteranno comunque a casa più di 10 mila euro netti al mese. A meno che il comico non faccia un po' di chiarezza nei prossimi giorni

(18 febbraio 2013)

Quanto guadagneranno i futuri parlamentari del Movimento 5 Stelle?

Il tema non è – naturalmente – al centro della campagna elettorale, anche perché il movimento di Grillo è l'unico ad aver promesso un'immediata autoriduzione degli stipendi, ancor prima che ogni legge la imponga.

Tuttavia attorno alla questione c'è una gran confusione, che lo stesso Grillo pare aver alimentato.

Nel programma del Movimento è scritto infatti a chiare lettere che lo stipendio dei parlamentari dovrà essere «allineato alla media degli stipendi nazionali».

E di quant'è la media degli stipendi in Italia? Secondo l'Istat, lo stipendio netto degli italiani è di circa 1.400 neuro mensili. Stando così le cose e rifacendoci al programma del Movimento i parlamentari 5 stelle, con la modica somma di 1.400 euro netti al mese, svolgerebbero il loro mandato.

Tuttavia il Codice di comportamento del movimento 5 stelle in parlamento, un documento emesso dal leader Grillo, detta una linea molto diversa sul trattamento economico dei futuri parlamentari. ""L'indennità parlamentare percepita dovrà essere di 5 mila euro lordi mensili"". I parlamentari del Movimento avranno comunque ""diritto a ogni altra voce di rimborso tra cui diaria a titolo di rimborso delle spese a Roma, rimborso delle spese per l'esercizio del mandato, benefit per le spese di trasporto e viaggio, somma forfettaria annua per spese telefoniche"". Facendo due calcoli nelle tasche del futuro parlamentare sarebbero pressappoco 11 mila euro netti, contro i 14 mila attuali. L'unico risparmio che si avrebbe è esclusivamente quello per l'indennità che attualmente è di 10.435 lordi al mese e passerebbe a 5.000 euro.

Ma non finisce qui. Con un post intitolato ""Tagliare si può, volare si può"" pubblicato sul su sito, Grillo afferma di volere l' «adeguamento stipendi dei parlamentari a media europea». Ma questo rischia di rappresentare un ulteriore aumento dello stipendio, perché la media europea per l'indennità è più alta dei 5.000 euro proposti nel Codice di comportamento del Movimento 5 stelle.

«Non vorrei che vi fosse la paura, avendo banalizzato la scelta dei canditati alle politiche, che qualche forza politica possa comprarli», commenta Giovanni Favia, il primo clamoroso caso di epurazione dal Movimento 5 stelle, oggi candidato con Ingroia. «Quando uno è obbligato ad uno stipendio di 2.500 euro come abbiamo noi in Regione, di fronte ad uno di 14 mila magari è tentato a vendersi: e forse è per questo che Grillo ha deciso di lasciare a tutti i suoi eletti in Parlamento uno stipendio 'da Casta'».

Questo significa che i candidati delle aree che hanno votato meno andranno in parlamento scelti dai voti dei loro parenti ed amici. Tante parole sull'essere migliori della classe politica e poi si decide di farsi rappresentare dal primo che passa per strada. Inoltre il movimento 5stelle non è riuscito a risolvere il suo conflitto con Grillo e darsi una struttura organizzativa degna di un partito che abbia l'interesse di riformare il paese. Chi prenderà le decisioni una volta eletti? voteranno secondo coscienza (chi assieme al pd e chi con la lega), seguiranno le direttive di grillo o si atterranno solo al programma che hanno portato?  
Perchè il programma del movimento è una banderuola: lacunoso e pieno di cose irrealizzabili. Grillo dal palco ha urlato alcune bestialità che non stanno ne in cielo ne in terra, referendum impossibili sull'uscita dall'euro, soldi recuperati retroattivamente dalle tasche dei partiti. si è dimostrato in più occasioni xenofobo e credulone.
 
Io, da persona di sinistra, voterò per il PD, e senza turarmi il naso come ho fatto nelle passate elezioni. Questa volta il partito è solido e compatto, si è liberato di molti vecchi manipolatori e ha sedato le correnti ex-dc. Sono l'unico partito che ha candidato persone scelte davvero dagli elettori, che hanno votato alle parlamentarie in 3 milioni e mezzo. E' la più grande occasione che la sinistra italiana ha, da quando voto, di mandare in pensione il Berlusconismo e finalmente provare a governare senza i ricatti di gentaglia come Mastella o Dini. (Vendola è un uomo di governo, è a capo di una regione da anni e sa anteporre la necessità di riforma alle sue private ideologie)  
Comprendo che rimangano il lista alcune persone (anche a me) sgradevoli come la Bindi, che comunque al di là delle sue scenate in tv è una che quando ha avuto incarichi governativi li ha svolti bene, e che sarà pure bigotta ma l'unica legge sulle unioni di fatto presentata in Italia era firmata da lei.  
L'Italia ha oggi un piede nella fossa e serio bisogno di riforme, e tra le prime tre forze politiche, il PD è l'unica che non ha fatto una campagna populista ma improntata sulla serietà e guardando al futuro del paese. Non arrivo a dire che una persona contraria al programma del PD debba votarli semplicemente per bloccare i pericolosi populismi, però quelle persone che ritengono di avere idee di sinistra dovrebbero votarli eccome, perchè ogni voto in più per il PD è un voto alla governabilità e alla sinistra, e un voto in meno al governo di larghe intese che rischiamo di avere se il PD non ce la fa da solo.

24 febbraio 2013 

«Come avevamo previsto e spesso denunciato durante la campagna elettorale, la sinistra campione d'imbrogli ha messo in atto la strategia del voto rubato. Ad Anzio é stata pizzicata ieri e denunciata alla Digos, una veterana presidente di seggio iscritta e militante del PD che aveva sottratto alcune schede elettorali per il voto. É evidente che la paura della sconfitta dopo aver creduto di vincere facilmente spinge la sinistra ai noti metodi truffaldini per correre ai ripari. Ma a poco varranno questi beceri tentativi di frode, si rassegnino all'Immagine della sconfitta».

 È quanto dichiara, in una nota, Maurizio Brugiatelli, responsabile cittadino La Destra di Anzio.

«Pizzicata presidente di seggio ad Anzio che rubava schede per le regionali. Immagina a quale partito le doveva indirizzare. Penoso».

È quanto scrive, riferisce una nota, su Twitter, Francesco Storace, candidato alla presidenza della Regione Lazio.

Scusami ma ho un'idea di cosa debba essere la politica lontana anni luce da quel partito, con il quale condivido molti contenuti ma non il modus operandi. Se guardi alla storia il potere si è sempre spostato, lentamente, dall'alto al basso, e dopo ha iniziato a diffondersi (monarca tramandato da dio/oligarchia/sovranità popolare/suffragio pluralista/suffragio universale). 
Adesso io credo che la sovranità popolare effettiva, democrazia diretta, sia l’obbiettivo da perseguire. Non so se il movimento riuscirà in questo intento nel corso di questa legislazione, ma è sicuramente la forma politica che più si avvicina alle mie idee.

Se invece preferite che dei politici, forma moderna degli aristocratici, continuino a curare i propri interessi ignorando le direttive del popolo sovrano, beh in tal caso avete bisogno di votare un leader.

6-10: Primary school. Only one of those. Marks in 3rd and 4th grade. Before that, you only get some kind of review in text form from your teacher. The final mark + the opinion of the teacher in 4th grade decide on what schools you can go to after that.

10-16: Secondary schools. 4 of those. Hauptschule (basic school), Realschule (hard to translate. It's in the middle. That's all you need to know), Gymnasium (highes level). There are minor differences between Realschule and Gymnasium. I had the final exam in 10th grade from a Gymnasium to learn for mine on a Realschule. Hauptschule is very easy compared to the others. All of them have their own degrees. You can make the Realschule degree on a Hauptschule if you do 10B (that's the 10th grade from a Realschule on a Hauptschule). You can get qualifications for college (later more about that) on a Realschule if your average mark is 3.0. Gymnasium gives you college qualifications if you just pass. You can fail every class once. If you fail again, you have to go to the school below your current one. No idea what happens if you fail twice on a Hauptschule. There's also a Gesamtschule (gesamt = everything, entirely, entire, something like that. ""Die gesamte Klasse"" = ""The entire class"") which allows you to make every degree on those schools. If you fail, you can just change class. 

Now it gets a bit more complicated. College!

Most college degrees are 3 years (I think the academic one is 2 years now). There are 3 basic types of college degrees. FHR, AHR and some weird other thing. FHR means Fachhochschulreife (Fach = subject, Hochschule = hoch school (those are universities in Germany), Reife = maturity). You can study anything you want on a University of Applied Science with that. It's a degree focused on practical usage and not academic. That means you don't need a second foreign language and mathematics is a bit easier (which is bullshit. Later more to that). You can do them with an apprenticeship which is a huge bonus for universities especially since most of the Universities of Applied Science require you to do an internship that is already included in your FHR with apprenticeship.

Then there's AHR. A stands for ""general"". The rest stays. It's focused on academic work and allows you to study on any university you want to study on. You can do that on a Gymnasium as well (same as sixth form in the UK). You can also combine those with an apprenticeship. 

The last thing is something weird. It is a mixture out of both but you can only study your subject on a university. So if you did a ""Fachbedundenes Abitur"" (subject bound Abitur) in CS, you can study CS on a university. If you notice that you like electronics more, you're fucked. 

There are literally 20 or more schools you can do either of those degrees on. 


Not it gets a bit easier. Universities: 2 of those. If you did your college degree in 3 years, you're 19 when you start. one is the University and the other is the University of Applied Science. The University is focused on academic. You could get through the old CS degrees without programming one line of code. Mathematics is basically proofing stuff. If you study CS, you have mathematics with mathematics students. It's theory only. 

The University of Applied Science is focused on practical usage of those skills (so basically working in a non-academic environment). The mathematics is a bit easier and you don't learn stuff you'll never need. My electronics teacher in college said that 80% of the mathematics he learnt in uni was a waste of time. The University of Applied Science prepares you good enough for a master on a university, though. If you've finished your bachelor, you know enough about mathematics that a master on a university will require some work but you're not completely lost.

And there's where the bullshit appears. Mathematics in schools is bad. Really bad. Most people fail in scientific subjects because they've got no idea about mathematics. Professors are complaining the entire first semester about bad mathematics skills and blame the school and they're right. After the first semester, you see how much bullshit schools did. But that's not the topic.

Bachelor and Master take 10 semesters together. Most of the time, the Bachelor is 6 and the Master 4. That can shift, though. After your Master, you can do your PhD. You'll be overqualified, though. The PhD is a research degree. You don't need it in a normal job. It's required for chemistry or something like that, though, but not for most other jobs. I think the PhD looks different in Germany compared to other countries. You take a subject, you write about it and if it's something new and scientific relevant, you get your PhD. 

A little addition to the college degree. If you don't want to do that, you can do an apprenticeship. You have to write exams and get a degree in your profession of choice. You get paid and everything. It's not ""the worse way"" compared to uni just a different way and the German society also see it like that. 

Also, education is a matter for the state. Everything I've said is only for **North Rhine Westphalia**.

    Est-il possible de refuser de recevoir de la prospection politique envoyée à partir de la liste électorale consulaire ?

Les informations figurant sur la liste électorale peuvent être utilisées à des fins de propagande politique par les candidats ou les partis. Le code électoral permet en effet à tout parti politique et tout candidat d'obtenir ces listes, sans que les électeurs puissent s'y opposer.

En revanche, vous pouvez demander au candidat ou au parti concerné qui vous a adressé un message de ne plus vous en envoyer.

    Que doivent contenir de tels messages ?

Tout message électronique envoyé à un électeur doit contenir les informations pratiques lui permettant d'exercer l'ensemble de ses droits "" Informatique et Libertés "" (droit d'accès, de rectification…). Il doit également préciser les modalités selon lesquelles il peut demander, à tout moment, à ne plus recevoir de nouveaux messages et contenir un lien de désinscription par exemple, de nature à faciliter ce droit d'opposition. Il doit enfin mentionner l'origine des données (les listes électorales consulaires).

    Que faire pour ne plus recevoir de messages électroniques de la part de tel parti ou tel candidat ?

Pour cela, il suffit de cliquer sur le lien de désinscription qui doit figurer dans le message. Vous pouvez aussi adresser un mail ou un courrier au parti ou au candidat concerné. Le responsable de traitement ne peut alors plus utiliser l'adresse électronique de l'électeur.

    Je me suis opposé à la réception de nouveaux messages de la part d'un parti ou d'un candidat déterminé mais je continue de recevoir des mails de sa part. Que dois-je faire ?

En cas de difficulté pour exercer votre droit d'opposition, il faut vous rapprocher de la CNIL qui s'assurera du respect de vos droits par le parti ou le candidat concerné. Vous pouvez à cet effet utiliser le formulaire "" témoignage "" de ce site ou adresser directement une plainte à la CNIL.

This is not to be underestimated, as it means that unlike France Australia's bond yields will always be low, for they are as safe to investors as the currency they are denominated in.

This is demonstrated most clearly watching what happened once the ECB announced that it'd buy bonds for embattled nations assuming they met the prescribed austerity programs - bond yields fell immediately. In Australia we have the RBA that will *always* back our bonds if it came down to it, and without even imposing  austerity on the country. Accordingly, bonds are seen as the safest possible investment one can make in AUD - unlike French bonds which are not the safest possible investment one can make in Euros.

It's really no coincidence that the only countries that ran into issues with bond yield spikes were Euro users - even small nations with their own free-floating currencies Iceland/Poland etc experienced no such thing. Their bonds remained just above the central bank set interest rates, exactly where an investment seen as completely safe ought be.

Currency-issuing governments such as ours though are, whether they realise it or not, limited by inflation - by the real output capacity of their economy - and not by how much much money they've ""put aside"" in good times when it comes to tackling the bad.

This is simply because they can print assets that will *always* sell for a high price to raise revenue - bonds denominated in the currency the government issues. They can, although this is more controversial, even print the currency itself. Either is fine to tackle a recession, and neither is dependent on how much they've put aside. Crucially it is important to realise that spending money put aside in ""good times"" is no less inflationary than either of the other approaches. It's still adding money to circulation, money that was not before.

All that said, the 2000s were an appropriate time for surpluses for Australia. Private sector demand for spending was huge, and if the government attempted to run deficits the RBA would have had to have countered with high interest rates crowding out private sector investment.

In più, invita dei personaggi incredibili quando c'è il dibattito di cronaca/politica:

* Poletti (ex conduttore di TeleLombardia, leghista mai eletto)
* Sgarbi
* Mussolini
* Francesco Bruno (criminologo laureato in tuttologia e arroganza comparata con la lode)

Wait, now you lost me. You just said it was. Which is it?

&gt;  It's about a subculture of a subculture of a religious and regional culture. Islam per se isn't at fault - not entirely, although the story of Muhammad's having sex with a 9 year-old doesn't help - but rather the distorting lens of religious a social mores that despise non-Muslims and denigrate women. And that is the truth.

That may very well be the truth. There is no question that there are very significant problems in certain cultures on the Indian subcontinent having to do with gender roles. However, pedophilia is most certainly not accepted to any extent — the closest you get is some very rural areas in which underage marriage is still practiced.

The thing that just boggles the mind is how some people, apparently you included, can maintain this dual-think — you announce these facts as basis for your whackjob political opinions, while the truth is that networks of pedophile criminals are being discovered among the white majority just as often.

Child abuse doesn't change because of skin colour or religion — it's still just child abuse, not a part of the global conspiracy to introduce the caliphate state through cunningly having sex with children somehow…",0,1361721472,null,0,false,0,c8kt1iv,t3_1931ap,t1_c8kt1iv,t1_c8ksmga,null,1431391608,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1
true,JanitorsMonkey,NETH,The Netherlands,"In the Netherlands we have basic education (basisschool) from ages 4 to 12. It has a total of eight grades. 

After the eight grade you go to high school. From here on you can either go to **VMBO**, **HAVO** or **VWO**

VMBO is the lowest out of the three (preparatory middle-level applied education) , and it has 4 grades.

It's  divided in 5 different parts, from high to low:

* VMBO-TL (Theoretical education)
* VMBO-GL (Mixed education, both theoretical and practical)
* VMBO-KB (Middle management-orientated)
* VMBO-BB (Basic profession-orientated)
* VMBO-PrO (Practical education - meant for people who can't achieve a diploma with the other 4 educations. Note, this is usually an exception: around 25,000 people do this, in a country of 17 million.)

After VMBO you get HAVO, which literally means high general continued education. HAVO has 5 grades.

In HAVO you can select 4 different profiles at the 4th grade:

* Culture and society
* Economy and society
* Nature and health
* Nature and technology

At VWO (prepatory scientific education) this is the same, only it is more theoretical.

So, the average age of people who graduate from high-school is either  16 when they're in VMBO, 17 when they're in HAVO or 18 years old when they're in VWO. 

After high school follows the tertiary education.

**MBO** (4 years) when people graduate from VMBO

**Higher education** which consists out of **HBO** and **WO**

With HAVO you can enroll in HBO (4-6 years) for a bachelor. You can do a master, which takes 1-2 years. 

However, if you already did MBO or got a VWO diploma and you want to do a HBO education, you **can** get excemptions from courses so it takes 3 years to finish a HBO education.

**WO** is meant for people with a VWO diploma. This education is given at research universities. In other words, less practical, more theoretical. 

In Dutch you can't refer a HBO-school as an university, but in English you can. So basically, if you want to go to a ""real"" university, you should follow a WO-study.

If you want to know more, feel free to ask.

6-12 year olds go to primary school. 13-15 go to secondary school. 

Then you get a choice, you can go to a technical lyceum (15-18) or a general lyceum (15-18) or quit education altogether. 

For higher education there's a yearly exam you need to go through. If you come from a technical lyceum you are only allowed entry to technical colleges called ΤΕΙ. If you come from a general lyceum you can gain entry to both technical colleges and universities. 

University degrees take 4 years, most people take more time than that. Books and tuition were free until very recently. Universities also offer master programmes and have Phd positions. Universities are in general underfunded so you really need to take initiative to get the most out of them.

&gt; I always had the impression that Americans view their legions of lawyers more as the devil,

Yes, that cursory attitude is there among some people, however I think those same folks don't realize that the people whom they most look up to and admire - including politicians and activists - are erudite in respect to the issues they care about only because of having studied law.

America is a place of a lot of social drama. If you survey blogs across the US internet - you'll see that everybody has a passionate (and often ill-informed) opinion about public policy. This is reflected also in private discussions in people's homes and among friends.  It just strikes me as interesting that in that environment, the only people who are left standing at the end of the day when the partisan fights between people of different viewpoints have run their course are those who are versed in law. As I see it, they're the only ones who really have the cachet to command respect from people of every quarter. If you think about who the people are that are actually out there in the public eye doing things to try to effect progressive change, and not just sitting in their parents' basements venting in their internet blog - it's those who have studied law - people like Lawrence Lessig, or Susan Crawford, or Ralph Nader or Barack Obama.

Furthermore, one can look at on the other side of the coin, and see that Americans very much believe in a polarity between ""bad people"" and ""good people"" - and that they earnestly want the bad people sieved out like the chaff from the wheat and put into prison. Even here on Reddit, whenever there's a news story posted about some crime in the USA, there is endless passionate invective directed toward the person who did it. Relatively progressive US states like California have at the heart of their  system things like the ""three strikes law"" which is ostensibly there to get troublemakers into jail and out of idyllic suburban neighborhoods, before they do anything terribly wrong. Who exercises this wish of the public? Again, it is those who have studied law. They are the ones who hold the fate of many individuals in their hands (like gods would).",0,1361722838,null,0,1361725953,0,c8ktcdg,t3_194cqu,t1_c8ktcdg,t1_c8kov39,null,1431391741,0,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,0

May not be 100% correct. Some things sound awkward when translated. Also you can switch ""Rezension"" with ""Bericht"" if necessary.

Also next time use someone who is a professional. Only costs about 85 cent per row and someone may use you in his CV. How cool is that ;)

true,umbama,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Ok, I was quoting a claim made by Trevor Philips, the (black) Chairman of the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission - and he, I'm sure, was using 'race' in a broader sense, not to suggest there's something ineluctably criminal about an entire race - but more in the social / cultural sense.

So, taking your points.

1. Does it exist.

Yes, there is an over-representation by Asians whose family origins are in Pakistan:

&gt;*Last Week Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of The Ramadhan Foundation, said: ""There is an over-representation [of Asian men] amongst recent convictions in the crime of on-street grooming [and] there should be no silence in addressing the issue of race as this is central to the actions of these criminals,"" he said.*

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18092605

2. What's the reason for it?

I'd say it's a number of factors including but not limited to: the position of women in Islam; a sexually distorting culture; a culture that's derogatory of women and non-Muslims.

&gt;*You and a lot of other xenophobes*

I'm not a xenophobe. You're the one denying the facts or declining to do the most basic Googling to inform yourself of them. I think under the circumstances I'm being very temperate.

&gt;*assuming you're talking ""The Liberal Party""*

No, never mind, you're missing the subtleties of politics here in the UK. I didn't mention the Lib Dems I said my view these days incline more towards the classical Liberal of Mill - but again, if you can't be bothered to Google yourself out of ignorance you can let it pass, it doesn't matter.

&gt;*the other stuff that's all the jive in /r/europe*

There are of course racists around. Racists like those criminals who targetted white girls, for example. There are some on Reddit. But they're not anything like the majority. Your difficulty is a propensity to leap on any discussion of fact that disturbs you as evidence of racism.

And as I've repeatedly said, sticking your head in the sand is a very, very inadequate response. It's why the BNP picks up votes - because sensible people aren't taking the facts head on and trying to talk about them reasonably, in the way I have here (and for my pains been called a racist, a xenophobe, and suchlike).

&gt;&gt; mi vorresti dire che tutti i partigiani avevano un dottorato ? Eppure hanno contribuito a scrivere la costituzione 

&gt;Dire che la costituzione è stata scritta dai partigiani è una grossa semplificazione... http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblea_Costituente_della_Repubblica_Italiana

Infatti ho detto contribuito intendendo ideologicamente , mio nonno era partigiano ma era un contadino ovviamente non aveva le capacità di stendere il testo di una costituzione però ha rischiato la sua vita per un ideale che riteneva giusto e che anche una persona semplice capisce perché è appunto innato

&gt;non lo so, forse lo è. Quello che penso io è semplicemente che non si può pensare di saper fare tutto né che tutti abbiano la competenza per decidere su tutto. Ognuno ha il suo bagaglio di competenze e dovrebbe esprimersi solo su quello di cui è competente. Per citare un esempio concreto, l'altro giorno si discuteva sulla sperimentazione animale. A me fa bollire il sangue quando vedo quello che scrivono gli anti vivisezionisti- sono persone che di come funziona la sperimentazione non sanno *niente*, non sanno *niente* di biologia, non sono mai state in laboratorio etc - eppure pretendono di venire a dire a chi fa il ricercatore come deve fare il suo lavoro! L'opportunità di usare o meno animali deve essere decisa da *chi ha le competenze per deciderlo*, punto. Nessun altro ci deve mettere bocca. E lo stesso vale per un sacco di altre cose. Non si può pensare che tutti possano decidere su tutto - a un certo punto si deve scegliere una persona competente che ti rappresenti e decida per te. 

Se è per questo anche i politici di altri partiti non hanno tutte le competenze richieste da ogni caso ,non penso Bersani o Vendola sappiano come gestire una banca o un laboratorio.Ovviamente si affidano a consulenti per i dettagli e per avere una idea delle politiche da proporre. Quello che a mio parere gli elettori del M5S sono chiamati a fare è brainstorming sulla strategia o politica da seguire. Certo dovrebbero trovare un modo per ridurre la caciara ad una discussione più civile . E magari fanculizzare gli esperti di scie chimiche :-)
Per gli esperti di vivisezione la risposta è molto semplice ,se non ci fosse stata sperimentazione sugli animali la vita media dell'uomo occidentale sarebbe di 25 anni (senza fonte ma rendo l'idea )

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; in reality people stop lending you money.

You cannot provide a single example of a government that issues a free-floating currency and has all debt denominated in that currency ever being denied its own currency by lenders. I know that, because it's never happened in history.

Japan is testing this theory more than any other - yet despite more debt than any other nation, a comparatively low credit rating and *no* prospect of ever ""paying it all back"", there's still a queue of Japanese looking to buy newly issued bonds.

Oh, and they're struggling with *deflation* to boot - not even inflation.

&gt; it's delayed taxation

Whoever said anything about paying it back?

Government debt, merely as a matter of accounting, is non-government savings. Money is created through debt, if the non-government (ie households) want to accrue net savings they need to put the government into debt. Paying back the government debt is then destroying non-government savings - not something most economies would take well to.

So debt is the normal state for most governments to be in, at least for all but the most debt happy private-sector nations like Australia and Norway (one of the most indebted private sectors in Europe).

The more savings households have denominated in the currency a government issues, the more debt that government has. That's no coincidence - the latter provides the money the former calls ""savings"".

&gt;  from the savers and the strivers

Deficits add to savings. Surpluses drain savings. If society wants more savers and less indebted households - you need government deficits, not surpluses.

&gt;So the future fund to actually pay for the retirement funds of public servants is bunk?

Completely bunk. The government doesn't need to buy assets today to be able to spend AUD in the future, and anyone that thinks it does is gravely mistaken.

As for Singapore/China - I'm personally less socialist on these matters and more free market, but if you want to argue that it's the government's role to secure foreign resource contracts and plan foreign investments I'll let you have that. Personally, I'd leave foreign investing up to the private sector as I believe them to be more efficient allocaters of capital and that the government being the institution that imports resources as inappropriate, but I won't debate it. There is a decent argument for socialism at times, I accept that.

As for Norway, fascinating case. Foreigners buy NOK on forex markets to purchase Norway's NOK-denominated oil exports. The government acquires this NOK, and then puts it back on the forex markets purchasing foreign currencies and foreign currency denominated stocks. The net effect of this is that it devalues the NOK, making imports and foreign investment more expensive for Norwegians than if the government wasn't devaluing the currency in this manner/investing in foreign stocks. What the Norway government has to show for this devaluation is a long-term store of wealth which it can rely on to hold its currency up even after the supply of oil has come to end. Is it appropriate for it to be doing this? I'm unsure. *Probably*.

Make no mistake though - the government doesn't gain any additional ability to finance deficits through this. It always has the capability to do that. What the sovereign wealth fund grants it is the ability to make imports cheaper at a future date, at the cost of making them more expensive today and depleting its oil reserves faster than had it not been intervening in this manner.

Importantly too, this policy isn't dependent on surpluses in the slightest. Governments can always instruct their central banks to simply buy foreign currencies - China did this for the longest time with the renminbi, and the net result is the same. A lower exchange rate and a wealth of foreign currencies it can use to prop up its exchange rate at a later date at the cost of a lower exchange rate today.",0,1361728715,null,0,1361771719,0,c8kuthd,t3_193klr,t1_c8kuthd,t1_c8ktyo7,null,1431392513,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The 'good' APN is ibox.tin.it if things haven't changed, whereas wap.tin.it will generally only let HTTP and mail through.

H3G (or 3/Tre) is the cheapest, but 3G coverage is poor outside cities and in some edge areas. You'll still have call coverage, as it roams on TIM's 2G network, but you will pay full price for data, so remember to disable data roaming in that case. For some reason they block the SMTP port if not to their server, but you'll be fine with any other port.

I don't have direct experience with Vodafone and Wind, the other 2 operators, but as far as I know they fall inbetween, with Vodafone somewhat more expensive and iffy with some ports, while Wind is cheaper and has clear plans.

In most cases if you change country roaming will work, but you'll incur HEAVY charges, especially for data, unless you purchase some specific roaming option. Each operator has some, and the international ones like Vodafone or H3G have some very good ones if you stay on their network in the other countries.

Honestly? I think it's a failing experiment to have an American-style university in Paris. Unlike some schools in Switzerland (such as Franklin College in Switzerland), the school is only accredited by an American organization (the French system is just too different, which is why very few French students attend the school).

You probably won't learn to speak French fluently if you are like most of the students there that hang around the ""campus"" all day long (**the location is terrible for a college. the administration is quite stubborn about staying in the 7th; they'd be MUCH better off trying to relocate to the Latin Quarter, near the Pantheon where a number of French universities already exist. It would not only be more tolerant of students, but also offer more physical room to grow for AUP and better, more welcomed ""penetration"" into the Parisian/French culture**).

*There is no more French major offered at AUP.* That should tell you a lot about the school.

I will say there is certainly a level of arrogance within the administration -- they think they're on the same level as schools like NYU (which they previously had an exchange relationship with before NYU wised up, broke off, and did their own program), so they charge NYU prices. It simply doesn't add up and when you dare to challenge them, they get defensive and throw the blame back on you with the excuse of ""you're paying for living in Paris.""

I'm sorry, I don't believe that excuse works at a place like NYU or Columbia which offer EXCELLENT academic programs. You don't see Hunter College or Baruch College (no offense) ripping off their students (do they?).

The school could really be great, but they use the ""we don't have money"" excuse a lot, especially ridiculous when they send the school president jet setting around the world on ""fund-raising"" functions. The general population of students are entitled, spoiled, don't give a shit about academics, and just want to party and do drugs (and the school doesn't bother to educate the new crop of 17-18 year old kids on idiotic pressure to conform to the ""AUP lifestyle"" of drinking and smoking a pack of cigarettes every single day. It's shameful and irritating to those who want to actually, you know, learn and try to enjoy the environment).

I was disappointed to find out that the school didn't offer (or even think about instituting) partnerships with any of the ~17+ or so ""American University of _____."" There is no affiliation with any other institution (other than some exchange agreements with more entitled art schools in NY), but AUP really could leverage the international experience by developing an official agreement with some of the other ""American University of"" schools.

Keep in mind there are ""good"" things about the school, but the irritations/annoyances never go away, and you're faced with them every single day. What is most bothersome is with all of the frustrations and difficulties of adjusting to life in a foreign country (setting up a bank account; trying to get a cell phone; finding a decent apartment), the school's administration further compounds on frustration with a markedly unhelpful attitude in a number of things. Obviously they have their own frustrations in dealing with students who are lazy and entitled, but they still treat the majority of students with disrespect.

A lot of this may just be due to the difficulties of Paris/France -- which is why I'll say again: an ""American-style"" college in Paris just doesn't work.",0,1361731636,null,0,false,0,c8kvn6x,t3_16way7,t1_c8kvn6x,t3_16way7,null,1431392952,2,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,2

Interestingly, most of the main parties are actually for marriage equality (Social Democrats, the Green party, the Liberals) - but the main party, the Christian Democrats are having a bit of struggle.
They had a party conference not too long ago, where they decided against marriage equality. But now, due to the constitutional court's decision on adoption, there are people asking for a revision of the decision. Problem is: the Christan democrats have a very ~~conversvative~~ conservative Bavarian branch (CSU), that are pretty vehemently against it. 

Personally, I think they will reverse their position: societal pressure is mostly against them. But basically, they are afraid to lose their core voting base.

I don't recall ever having used a public toilet in the US that had a suction power that you're eluding to except for on planes or something.  I find most German toilets about the same as those i used in the US my whole life.  
I think most public toilets in Germany usually have a wall switch that consists of two buttons: a small one (for if you just took a piss) inset in a large one (for number 2s).  Usually, you only have to push these buttons once and the toilet just flushes like normal as the button slowly retracts from the position you push it in to.  If you push it in all the way, i feel it flushes for a normal (US standard) amount of time and usually gets the job done on the first flush.  
  
Some older toilets and many in private houses such as my flat have a button on the pipe that i have to hold in for it to flush.  I've never held that button in for more than 5 seconds.  And i have one of those [shelf toilets](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=xw3e6DJ8aKU#t=11s) where your shit lands on a porcelain shelf above the water and needs to be pushed into the water at the bottom by flushing.  
  
I've seen just as many of those truck-stop rotating towel hand dryers in the US as here.  Actually the only places i've seen them here are in old bars (and one random movie theater).  The kind of bars where you don't really wanna touch anything with your bare hands anyway and aren't really surprised to find something like that in the bathroom.  
  
In my city, i can think of at least three restaurants, plus the shopping mall and the train station that all have air-blades.  I've also seen them in an airport in Croatia so it's not like they're foreign technology in Europe.  
I think you've maybe just had some bad luck in Germany.  Most likely you were in old buildings or something.  
  
If you're gonna get pissed about German toilets, let's talk about why you have to pay to piss everywhere.  Even in restaurants where i am paying for every beer that's making me have to piss, when i go downstairs to the bathroom, there's some cleaning lady standing there with her plate of 50 cent pieces staring at you.
