The artificially set interest rates to often encourage investing do not indicate the true health of the economy,leading to misinformed decisions by investors as well as banks,which in turn leads to a crash.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;First of all , that's pretty racist ...

What is? Could you specify? 

&gt;Second of all , that's a very simplified version of it, and it's not really exactly how it works. 

What is? Do you know of any federation that do not have permanent transfers? Are you saying that the perment transfer would be *smaller*? 

&gt;Italy or Greece isn't exactly an example of sound economics either,I'll give you that, but you're really not making a good argument against integration itself.

And Spain and Portugal, and I am actually quite doubtful about France. *Any* federation contains permanent tranfers - are you saying that they do not? That would mean *more* money transferred from north to south. Furhtermore, they do, which I have absolutely no problem of proving if you like, pay less taxes than we do, and also, which I also have no problem of proving, are far more corrupt countries. 

Apart from that, I'd like to point out that Greece and Spain for example has been on the receiving end since *1986*. However, the last 27 years has *not* managed to make them fix their economy and become contributors, it is worse than ever. How many more decades of some counties receiving money do you want? How many generations? Estonia didn't exists as a country when Greece entered, they are now paying their debts! Empires have risen and fallen in the time southern Europe has not fixed their economy. What is more relevant, countries like Brazil, Korea, Thailand, China has pulled themselves out of their misery, but southern Europe is *still* on the reciving end - with no end in sight. How many generations of us do you want/need to pay for southern Europe? 

&gt;It's not really a case of lazy southerners as you make it sound.

I have never said lazy. Point out where I have. I have said, and I can back it up too, corrupt and low productivity. Add to that that they like to vote for even more corrupt politicians like Berlusconi and have made a mastery of escaping taxes.the north pay far more taxes, both in percentages, and in the fact that we actually pay them.  I can back that up too, if you like. Also, they refuse to implement changes. That is for example evident if you see how the EU laws and directives are implemented. Which countries are in the lead? Not Greece, I can tell you that. 

&gt;It's not really a case of lazy southerners as you make it sound. If it really was , then countries such as Netherlands and France wouldn't be in the situation they are in now.

No, the whole Euro is messed up (and I am not to fond of the international finance market, but that is a whole different issue). Making a currency union without rules (or, to be correct, make rules and then ignore them) for economies that are far to different, that is not ending well. So, the reason for southern Europes problem isn't all low productivity, it is also added by the Euro, I certainly agree to that. That doesn't mean however that I was not right about everything I said before and I do not want to be in a federation with any countries really, apart form maybe other Nordic ones.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I agree that the government should address the issues, but if you're going to criticise the EU for attempting to appease the feckless masses then you ought to use less emotional language such as ""bankers bonuses misses the real problems,which governments ought to address,rather than putting on a political show for the common folks"". It's just this criticism of ""they should focus on the *real* issues"" which bothers. They are focusing on the real issues. If this is not a real issue, then I invite you to tell me what the *real* issues are. 

Let's address this problem from a different angle. Let's assume that they're not just putting on a show. We should base our decision on an analysis of the facts and not on presumptions about what the real motives are. If a piece of populist policy works, then who cares if it's populist?

I do like what you said about the Wall Street Crash. There were many factors at play. Bull pools are what I emphasise as the main problem, but I'd be lying if I said the 5% of Americans who had begun traded stocks were not also a cause of the problem. It's a question of emphasis. They both helped, but I don't think that one would have happened without another. If the non-economically literate masses had avoided dabbling in stocks then the head bankers of the time would have had nobody to fool with their bull pool. And if the masses hadn't had those bull poolers deceiving them, then there probably would never have been a crash because the markets would never have been distorted to the extent they were. However I think that the entire problem could have been avoided if the Federal Reserve Board had actually intervened and taken proper action which if consistently failed to do. But now we're getting side lined.

Your point about Fannie Mae and FReddie Mac. You're right that they are government sponsored, but I ask you what difference that makes? They act like normal enterprises. They have the same problems of executive pay just like any other privately funded organisation. 

Anyway, we're really got lost in in the detail in here and you're trying to trip me up with it and I think I've proven my case. I have solidly backed up everything I've stated and so far no one has offered an criticism which would prove that we would be better off without this legislation. You've said that other things are more important. Yeah, other things are always more important. But this is important too. Can you prove that it doesn't work? No, but neither can I. Can you prove that it would cause any meaningful negative effects? That I wonder.

 The government has the right, it has the authority, there is little to lose and there is much to gain. Those are the arguments. ",0,1380138859,null,0,false,0,ccfb6qj,t3_1n3zrb,t1_ccfb6qj,t1_ccfakx9,null,1429344631,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; It will be interesting to see how the world's developed economies deal with this in the future. Most likely with Japan having to figure it out first. 

Japan has a problem with its low fertility rates, declining population and caring for the aging population, and it will only become worse in the future. Currently almost a quarter of the population is over 65 years old and their share is rising while the population is declining. Even now already the healthcare system is strained for the lack of personnel such as nurses.

So far Japan's solution seems to be to try and develop robots to work as nurses and companions to the elderly. One reason for that is their immigration policy which is quite xenophobic. Rather than having for example foreign nurses immigrating to Japan they would have robots to care for the old.

Did. It's a form of tribalism, which is inherently racist by itself.I`ll look up academic articles about it if asked for.



2)There is literally no country that does not have transfers.In fact, there is no city in which all areas pay the same tax as they benefit for.I'm sorry if you feel like you're paying more than you're getting,but it's a fact of society.

I'm saying that the notion of transfers is not as much of a sin as you make it to sound like.




3)
Greece joined in 1981,Spain and Portugal joined in 1986. Both of them have a history you might want to look up,even Italy does.You don't fix a country overnight,and even if you want to...look at Eastern Europe (which to be honest,has much less fault in their history as it was pushed down their throats...) It's been 23 years and it's improving rather well, and will probably catch up with western and northern Europe at some point,if things stabilize and continue well maybe at some point Nordic countries will be receivers and they contributors.

 I'm glad you had the good fortune of being born in a country that did not have the same issues and can look down upon others with less luck than you.When it comes down to this, what you're commenting about is people, people that would like their chance for a better life.You're not talking about governments fate , but innocent individuals which are already suffering because all of this.

You forget that at some point, for some not THAT long ago, they were the Empires. Italy, Spain,France, even Portugal.Greece is where democracy came from. Things change... You're making it seem like the life-cycle of a country is that of a person.UK had 240% debt during the Napoleonic wars.

The total sums are not that big as you make it sound,but let's put that aside.I agree that there is a transfer between North and South and West and East.That's a basic fact of an internal market.Not everyone can be net contributors in an internal market,that's just not how things work.It's not about being in a federation or in an unitary state,this applies everywhere. Generally, zones which are economic powerhouses are going to be net contributors and zones less developed are going to be net receivers. 

If I grow up in France and the gov pays for my security,healthcare,education,etc. they are going to have a deficit.What happens when I get to 18 and instead of paying taxes there I move to Germany and pay taxes there. What happens when capital and services start doing that too? Are those countries ever going to be able to balance their budget ?

In any trade area there will be deficits and surpluses.Deal with it ! I agree with setting up regulations which keep everyone in check,of course.Although,it's not like the rest of the countries that you hold in regard have been respecting the 60% GDP and 3% deficit standard. Ireland and Spain have actually been more in line with those standards than anyone else, at least up to the financial crash.After the crash many countries increases their % of GDP debt as to bailout banks. 

I'd also like to point out the fact that you're not paying for them.The amount of money that the EU gets is for the common use,every country will benefit of investements in another Member State.A bridge between Romania and Bulgaria will benefit all trade within the EU that comes through that area.Don't make it sound like charity work. Futhermore,I'm not familiar with the specifics,but a lot of money gets exchanged between MS's , for example welfare of nationals that live in another MS country. 


4)Low productivity translated to lazy,unless you mean it in an economical sense.Then, what fixes low productivity is investment in capital.You invest in capital by borrowing money and paying it back later. I see a problem here.
Actually , Germany,Netherlands,UK, Sweden are one of the countries with the worst implementations of Union Law.Don't flatter yourself.
You do pay more taxes,but you do receive so much more in return from your gov.I'd even say that France pays more.Italy about the same.It's really not relevant if you pay more or not ... it's up to each country to make it's national budget as it can, and I already mentioned a problem with making a budget in an internal market without common regulations.
You make it sounds like people in those country enjoy corruption and don't want their country to improve. I assure you, that's not the case.



5) I agree.The euro was set up as a broken system.I'd even agree that financial markets are one of the main reasons why we even got here.

I disagree with you that you're correct. Why nordic countries? Are they superior or what?

Political prisoners, [Jews]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust_in_Lithuania), other unwanted minorities, refugees, Soviet prisoners of war, anyone who was killed during the years of German occupation by the Germans or collaborating Lithuanian military units and government. According to the Wikipedia page to which I linked above, the roughly 200,000 deaths under the German occupation time were the highest loss of life ever in the history of Lithuania. Yet I don’t see people talking about it, historical museums and events focus on the horrors of Soviet occupation or older history, and when I brought it up a few times while there people got defensive and visibly annoyed with me. 

Discussion of that period seems to revolve more around an interpretation of ""well, it was bad, but what could we do, we were fighting for independence against the Soviets"" as opposed to ""it was a horrible time with two horrible forces occupying our country. We are sad for the losses caused by both, and sorry for the losses caused by Lithuanians."" The hatred of the Soviet Union seems to be so strong that it overpowers any revulsion over any opponents of the USSR, even now, when people might have more historical perspective about what happened in the 1940s.

For example, in Vilnius there is a memorial wall with the names and dates of victims in Lithuania. Almost all of them are from the years of Soviet Occupation, before and after German occupation. There were very few dating from the years of German occupation. When I raised the issue to a Lithuanian (who brought up the topic first, specifically a need for more honoring of Soviet victims), he said something along the lines of ""of course victims form the German times should be honored too, but that the victims of the Soviets were the more tragic victims and the true national victims so it was understandable that they get the lions share of information. When I said “yes, but can’t their be room for everyone’s name on the wall” he told me that I didn’t understand how horrible the Soviets were. He just couldn’t see how there could be room to for all bad times, and that everyone who was killed was sad.

There are also cases like that of the Museum of Genocide in Lithuania. It was founded in 1992. For the first 19 years of its life it focused only on crimes committed by the Soviet Union. In 2011, after 19 years of international criticism, it finally opened an exhibition on people killed during the time of German occupation. Until then, it focused on the police state in the Lithuania (bad, and deserving of remembrance, but not genocide) and the harsh imprisonment of about 12,000 Lithuanians, of which 4,000 died (terrible, also worthy of memory. But far less than the 200,000 people killed during German occupation that the museum resisted mentioning for so long).  The bulk of the museum is still about the Soviets. 

According to the [same Wikipedia page to which I linked above]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust_in_Lithuania#Participation_of_local_collaborators), as well as other historical reading I did before going to Lithuania, this is in part because the was overlap between people hailed now as independence freedom fighters against the Soviets and people who collaborated in the deaths under German times, and the modern emphasis is on hailing independence efforts above other issues (Lithuanians, and the other Baltic states, are understandably excited to be independent). This sounds plausible to me – to bring up that time implies that their heroes were also villains, and that nationally, the country bears more responsibility than its chosen narrative of “only a few fringe Lithuanians collaborated in the Holocaust” story.

[This article]( http://www.lituanus.org/2001/01_4_04.htm) from the Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences Litaunas, goes over some  of the history, and mentions the current issues with denial and tensions, saying 

&gt; The only way for Lithuanians to lighten the load of the difficult history of 1941 is to embrace it. However artfully presented, the strategies of denial and evasion, the finger-pointing and righteous indignation directed at the Other, serve only to further weigh society down…Recognizing a historic burden is not the same as accepting collective guilt. No honest person argues that Lithuanians are a nation of criminals, or that today's Lithuanians are responsible for what happened in 1941 (anymore than contemporary Americans are responsible for slavery). But the legacies of such crimes, the historical burdens, remain. As a general proposition, attempts to evade, deny, minimize or misrepresent historical offenses are unsuccessful in the long run.

true,Kit_Emmuorto,vaticano,,"Per il momento non succede niente. I parlamentari oggi dicono: se il 4 ottobre in giunta si formalizza una maggioranza contro Berlusconi noi ci dimettiamo. La minaccia è integralmente politica: agiti l'aventino di un terzo del Parlamento ed è chiaro che se ci si arriva sono cazzi. Si tratta di un atto del tutto simbolico (gli si dovesse davvero dare seguito pratico sarebbe un delirio: ogni singola richiesta di dimissioni deve essere approvata dall'aula a voto segreto, e se passa al dimissionario subentra il primo dei non eletti).

In sostanza, questa faccenda è un piccolo passo in avanti nella strategia di pressione di Berlusconi sul Quirinale. Occhio al dettaglio: la decisione dei parlamentari di presentare le dimissioni è stata data prima che Berlusconi arrivasse. Questo serve per rappresentare un gruppo parlamentare avvelenato a prescindere da quello che dice Berlusconi: in questo modo, Berlusconi può dire al Quirinale o mi salvi o io questi non li tengo e anche se la follia non voglio farla io la fanno loro di testa propria. Altro dettaglio: stasera si è parlato di dimissioni dei parlamentari, ma non dei ministri. Questo serve a Berlusconi per tenere alto anche il versante poliziotto buono rappresentando un gruppo parlamentare (tendenza Forza Italia) di teste calde ma una delegazione di governo (tendenza Pdl) di profilo più basso. Questo per dire che se da qui a breve non si ravvisano inversioni di rotta scatta il giochino dell'appoggio esterno però coi ministri dentro.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; I disagree with you that you're correct. 

Prove me wrong then. I'd like to see you prove to me that southern europeans do *not* vote for corrupt bastards like Berlusconi. What more, I'd like for you to prove that they do not cheat far, far more on their taxes, and pay less while at it. Also, I'd like for you to prove that they are less corrupt. Also, I'd like for you to prove that it will be less permanent transfers to the south with a federation.  Start with that. And, I'd like real proof, as in credible links. I am at the uni, so I have access to all scientific journals. 

I am sorry, but if you say that I am wrong, I expect you to prove it. 

&gt;UK had 240% debt during the Napoleonic wars.

Are you serious? Who cares, we have never paid for them! It was 200 years ago. Are you saying that my grandchildren will have to pay for Greece's non productive corrupt grandchildren? 

&gt;Greece joined in 1981,Spain and Portugal joined in 1986. Both of them have a history you might want to look up,even Italy does.You don't fix a country overnight,and even if you want to...look at Eastern Europe (which to be honest,has much less fault in their history as it was pushed down their throats...)


So, you are saying that Greece that came out of dictatorship in *1974* and Spain in *1977* (I belive), and Italy in **1945** had an **harder** time than the Baltic states that **didn't even exist**. Talk about getting things showed down their throats-they fucking didn't even exists as a country. 

What you are saying is not only historically incorrect, you are extremely disrespectful towards Eastern Europe. In fact, you are just making shit up. I'd like you to post scientific evidence that Greece, Italy and Spain have had no chance to fight the corruption and develop properly and become productive. Scientic evidence please, as in well known economic journals. Otherwise, you are just making stuff up. 

As I said, countries who had it way worse, Korea, China, Brazil has pulled *themselves* up. They had it far, far worse than southern Europe (how many millions died on you in the last 50 years)  yet you ignore those. 

&gt;Generally, zones which are economic powerhouses are going to be net contributors and zones less developed are going to be net receivers.

Sigh, that changes. In the time of that Napoleonic war you are so fond of, we were dirt poor in northern Europe, so you are not talking about a scientific law. 

What irritates me is that you play it like southern Europe do not have a choice. Of course they do. They choose not to pay taxes, vote for dirtbags and not become productive. They have choices. When Estonia was deep in trouble and reforming their economy, Greece was living high on our money. Again - it is about the choices one makes. Why are you excusing that? You are just playing southern Europe as a victims. They are not, they have chosen every single game.



There are no special circumstances that excuses southern Europes lack of development, refusal to deal with corruption (how can you excuse southern Italy. It hasn't been fixed in 70 years. How much more time do you need?). 


&gt; If I grow up in France and the gov pays for my security,healthcare,education,etc. they are going to have a deficit.What happens when I get to 18 and instead of paying taxes there I move to Germany and pay taxes there

That question isn't even relevant until now, since the transfer of people in between EU countries has been very low. So, no excuse for the poor perfomance in the south. I think one of the biggest transfers were between the Nordic countries btw. Sweden have something like 10 % of Finns. That doesn't seem to have harmed Finland. So again, you are making stuff up. 

&gt;Although,it's not like the rest of the countries that you hold in regard have been respecting the 60% GDP and 3% deficit standard.

I agree, the Euro area is generally in trouble and no one cares about the rules.  

Again, some more questions.  How many more decades of southern Europe not giving, but receiving? What federations do you know that do not have permanent transfers? How are you going to fix southern Europe and in what time frame. For how many more years/decades/centuries are you planning to transfer money to them? 

&gt;That's a basic fact of an internal market.

No, that is when they buy stuff. What we are talking about is perment transfer, like California transferring to Alabama, since California is rich, and Alabama is poor. I pay for Greece's subway for example, or Spanish roads. They do not pay for mine. So, you are talking about the wrong sort of transfer. Try again. 

&gt;Not everyone can be net contributors in an internal market,that's just not how things work.

Again, we are talking about a federation. Please, do not mix up the terms. 


&gt;It's not really a case of lazy southerners as you make it sound.

**FFS-Prove that I said lazy southerners. You are making stuff up. Stop lying** Honestly, if you continue to write that without proof, I am going to start calling you far worse names. Why are you lying? Are your arguments so bad that you have to make stuff up? That is such a cowardly thing to do. 

&gt;Then, what fixes low productivity is investment in capital

Sometimes. Yes, it works in China and in Eastern Germany. Southern Europe has been on the receiving end for that too, for decades. Still not productive. Do you know how many billions have been sent to southern Italy? Still no change. One has to want to change too, want to become productive. Apparently they do not.

&gt;. Actually , Germany,Netherlands,UK, Sweden are one of the countries with the worst implementations of Union Law

No, we are not. Evidence. I am getting so tired of you making stuff up or straight out lying. 

&gt; You do pay more taxes,but you do receive so much more in return from your gov

Well, maybe it is because we do not vote for shitheads like Berlusconi. Furthermore, unlike the Greeks we might no be swayed by stuff like ""pensions for everyone at 55"". We vote for stuff like a balanced budget........Why do you choose to say that the voters in southern Europe are innocent? They are responsible for their politicians, and for their economy! Are you saying that southern Europe are not responsible for the choices they make? Why not? 

&gt;You make it sounds like people in those country enjoy corruption and don't want their country to improve.

So, the re-election of Berlusconi was by accident? It didn't happen perhaps? Or are you saying that he is completely honest? That the Greeks are just dying to pay more taxes, but somehow they just forget too? 

&gt;It's really not relevant if you pay more or not

Ok, then you pay more for the next three decades. Southern Europe are net contributors then if it makes no difference. I warn you - we have a lot of roads in Sweden.....

&gt; Why nordic countries?

Because I trust them, because our economies are far more similar (important), as some of our languages and a lot of our culture. Because they are not corrupt. Becaue they do not vote for assholes. Because they do not like you, excuse everything with non scientific arguments, they take responsibility even for their bad choices.

 Well, if one is not a complete madman, one lives up to the obligations. That is how politics works, if one is not insane. One follows treaties.

No, not really. Futhermore, it does no allow for bailout, transferring of debt, debt forgiveness, or the fact that ECB intervenes on behalf of individual countries. All that is against treaties and ECB rules.....

&gt;What are they going to do?

Let countries leave. Not bail them out. We do not have a federation. If one put oneself in the shitter, one should dig oneself out of it.

Do not think so.  Kick countries out, and force them to pay a fine for example.

No, not at all. Greece, Italy and Belgium started out with a far bigger debt/GDP ratio than they should have (maybe France too). Then everyone else followed.

I don't see how I could convince you that Turkey is a European country through replying to your comment. Basically because I am not certain what your definition of European is. Okay, Turkey's population is mostly Muslim but also secular. Turkey is as much a Muslim country as France is a Christian country. Religion doesn't play a huge role in people's lives, most people don't practice religion; they don't pray 5 times a day, they drink alcohol, have sex before marriage etc. Throughout the history, Turkey (and the Ottomans) always had more relations with European countries than with anyone else. Turkey has more in common with southern/eastern Europe than with middle east. By that I mean historical connections, physical appearance, social values, family structure, world-views etc. And it's not like every single country in Europe have so much in common. Turkey has more in common with, say, Italy than Bulgaria has with Sweeden, for instance. 

Edit: You said Turks weren't white in another comment. The word ""Turk"" doesn't refer to a race, but to a nation. Turks come in many colors and shapes thanks to various Ottoman conquests around Middle East, Africa and Europe.

My point wasn't that they didn't change and that they are victims.I agree that they should have gotten their shit together by now... My point was that the they didn't exactly have a choice between A and B. It's more complicated than that and you know it too.I mentioned the history because it points to the fact that they were once great empires that have fallen.I see no reason why they cannot become relevant again with proper reforms.It wouldn't be the first time that some countries have great recoveries.Bad decisions were made,every country makes bad decisions.Maybe not play the blame game and victimize individuals that are may as well be just as innocent as you are.No one anywhere is happy with the current situation,more than anyone the people that are living there.

Infringements of EU Directives : http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/docs/docs_infringements/annual_report_29/sg_annual_report_monitoring_eu_law_121130.pdf 

Please take into consideration that imports and exports determine the value of a currency(http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/050704.asp ; it's one of the factors that come into play , but in case of the eurozone it really is the most important factor of them all) .While there is the euro, that currency is set at an average above the real value of what they currencies of the following countries would be.That's a huge factor here! Please note the trade balance between all of the countries you dislike. Most of them have a negative trade balance or are very close to 0.

I agree that the macroeconomics of these countries are not solid, that they are not competitive as northern europe and that they have made bad decision (Greece more than all). However, they're not the only ones with questionable finances ( this graph shows how things escalated : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eurozone_Countries_Public_Debt_to_GDP_Ratio_2010_vs._2011.png ).

In my opinion the real problem of this crisis is the euro and the lack of integration necessary for it. The fact that Ireland,,Netherlands,Cyprus, even the UK and France have got hit so hard at the same time, some of them with good macroeconomic foundations tends to prove that it's not an internal only problem.True , the ones you mentioned (Greece may be in a special case of itself) did not have the foundations to survive as long and were first to show signs of problems.However, if not the currency union, they would have been stable and not in the awful situation they are in. (higher inflation; not as much unemployment but some ; increase of debt,etc , just a recession as usual)

Italy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Italy

Spain : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Spain
 
Portugal : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Portugal
 
Greece : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Greece 

France : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_france

They do export in Europe.And if you look at the exports , you'll see Germany, which has a real value of its currency way above the value of the Euro.Furthermore, look how much they all depend on each other for import-exports.

My point about the transfers of wealth between different areas was that people accept it as a gain for an internal market. I'm sure not all areas in Sweden,Germany,etc. have the same productivity and the same contribution to the national budgets.If you consider it so bad to pay for Greece and Spanish roads with a proportion of your tax dollars, then It would be fair to be as upset about paying for any roads that you may never get to use,such as those in Northern Sweden,which (let's assume,i`ll fact check soon) is a net receiver from the national Swedish budget.Correct? In that case I would find it reasonable to conclude that you would have nothing against de-establishing the current swedish national budgetary and fiscal system.


To be continued : Because you made such a strong point of the EU budget and how much we're giving those other countries and not getting anything in return I`ll look at the exact numbers are see how much each of the following countries are getting : Portugal,Greece,Spain,Italy,France , and exactly how much Sweden is contributing/receiving , and how much you, as a swedish citizen that pays taxes, are sending to people you don't trust. Afterwards , we`ll see if that is a reasonable sum to pay for what you receive.


Okay. EU Budget source : http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-interactive-money
Let's go with a 2012 version.It's what happened and not what will happen.Let's see what we actually paid for and what we have already lost from southern countries.Let's see if there's a valid reason for the outrage against them. Seems fair enough,right? 

Sweden: 

You give : 304.45 ; You get : 186.61 =&gt; It means you,as a citizen of Sweden and of the European Union pay 117.84 per year for all of this, on average.
 
National figures are 2.9bn - 1.8bn. Sweden pays 1.1bn for membership per year, out of the 287.9 billion (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Sweden) 

Honestly,I would say that 117 euro seems like a reasonable price for everything the EU does,especially considering that the average gross salary is 3,911 € / 5,279 $, monthly (2006). Furthermore, imports and exports in Sweden seem to be mostly with Member States of the EU or members of the EFTA. Not to mention that you have a positive trade balance. I'd say Sweden needs the EU pretty much.

Now,how much of that 304.45 actually goes to those in Southern Europe.

Spain: Growth - 18.76 ;  Agriculture : 17.17 =&gt; Total : 35.93

Greece : Growth - 10.48 ; Agriculture : 7.10 =&gt; Total : 17.58

Portugal : Growth - 9;71 ; Agriculture : 2.24 =&gt; Total : 11.95

Italy : Growth - 9.34 ; Agriculture :  13.71  =&gt; Total : 23.05

France :Growth - 9.10 ; Agriculture : 25.60 =&gt; Total : 34.7

Sweden : Growth - 1.93 Agriculture : 2.06 (this is what it still gets back in return to Sweden from money spend,besides the ones that you are getting ; i'm not sure how it works)  =&gt; Total : 3.99 

Total money that goes to the southern countries from the total contribution of an average swedish citizen(304.45, the rest go to other EU countries and to EU administration) : 123.21

Italy gives 236.47 and gets 158.11

France gives 277.50 and gets 202.35

So Italy , the country that you were specifically mentioning, is actually a giver towards the EU budget and not a receiver.

I should add, I personally think the CAP is a abomination and would love to abolish it.If so, the number would get a lot lower. Please recognize that the only reason the administration cost is inflated significantly and the CAP still exists is the fact that national members can veto decisions which they consider are of national significant / interests (I forget the exact phrasing , and I believe it was added to the Single European Act of 1986 at the request of France,I may have the treaty wrong,but it's essentially correct). So... blame the French for a significant amount of your money being lost. Personally, I'd want a reform of the constitutional structure of the EU so things like that can no longer happen,but that would essentially,from a constitutional perspective, be a confederation or federation.",0,1380145665,null,0,1380160030,0,ccfdrhx,t3_1n3ivz,t1_ccfdrhx,t1_ccfd1sr,null,1429343428,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

As far as truancy laws, don't think they exist, at least in Belgium. 

There is a store I go to and you see couple of gypsy kids begging during school hours and matter of fact, there is a police station nearby, and I've seen police simply walk by these kids, during school hours, I might add.

I can't really compare gypsies in the USA to the ones here in Europe, as I never met any in the USA, but let's just say that the ones here, aren't the saints painted by Madonna! :D

I should also say, saying that the gypsies in the usa are like the ones in Europe, is like saying, the blacks in Africa, shouldn't be much different from the blacks in the USA. Really?

Innegabile. Però i dati li vedo adesso, finora stavamo parlando di opinioni.

&gt; La mia opinione e' che a questa situazione siamo giunti con anni di 'intrugli' politici in nome dell'Italianita'

Questo è sicuro, l'ho scritto nel primo post di questo thread. La politica ha responsabilità pesanti in negativo nel destino di diverse compagnie italiane nel settore tecnologico.

&gt; Se va bene agli Italiani, buon per loro. Pero' poi anche questo si traduce in bassa produttivita', perdita di competitivita', disoccupazione e tutti quanti gli altri mali per cui stanno tutti sempre a piangere.

Guarda io lavoro proprio nel settore delle telecomunicazioni, anche se non mi occupo di rete fissa. Tra l'altro sono in una multinazionale quindi lavoro con operatori di diverse nazioni. 

Il problema della bassa produttività in Italia ora si sta affrontando. Non per scelta eh, non sia mai. Semplicemente è finita la grana e quindi sta diventando una necessità. Tutti gli operatori (e ancora di più i fornitori) stanno cercando in ogni modo di liberarsi di una marea di persone la cui produttività e competenza sono quantomeno discutibili.

Il più grosso ostacolo al recupero della produttività sono paradossalmente proprio i sindacati, che spesso sono ridotti a meri difensori dei privilegi acquisiti dall'esercito dei parassiti.

&gt;I`ll look up cases of corruption and questionable votes when I have time.

Of course we have it, just not to the same degree. [Here](http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/results/) is the International Corruption Index from 2012. The Nordic countries are all in a top 10, (OK, Iceland is 11). Spain is 30, Portugal 33, Italy 72 and Greece 94. So, yes, we have corruption, but no, nowhere near southern Europe. 

&gt;I don't disagree with most of what you accused them of.

Btw- in the 64 page document you posted, what did you want me to look at? You do know that Italy had most infrigements right? What are you trying to prove? 

&gt;Moreover, you seem to be doing it because of a sense of superiority...

Sigh, still no proof. You really have decided not to post any proof and just read stuff into everything I said. If you can't accuse me of calling them lazy, you have to make new stuff up. Why not stop posting stuff you have no evidence for? 


&gt;You look at all their failures and condemn them, that was my point.

They can do whatever they want, as long as I do not have to pay for them. Unfortunately,their unwillingness to change and their corruption means that they cost me money too, and, probably my non existing children. I mean, I don't rant about Eucadors corruption, or Moldovas bad choices.

&gt;How did you get to the conclusion that southern europe excuses everything with non-scientific arguments

You excuse them with non scientific arguments. And, I don't know how many Greeks that has told me about the dictatorship as a reason for not being productive. When I point out the Baltic states, China, Brazil etc, countries who has/have it rougher and certainly (in particular China)has had dictatorship far later. It is an excuse I am getting tired off, it is non scientific, not backed up by anything but southern Europe uses it. I think they should stop making up excuses and deal with the issue at hand. 

&gt;You need economies that are as diverse as possible trading with each other.

Yes, diverse is good for trading. *Not* for being in a federation or in a union, certainly not a currency union, and *not* for money transfers outside of trade. 

Read about [Optimum Currency area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area)

 

&gt;Yes,they should have gotten their shit together.

And they refused to. Why should I be punished, and my children and grandchildren for their refusal to act like responsible persons? What more, you actually don't help someone by just bailing them out the whole time. Permanent money transfers can be harmfult, that is a lot of economical theories behind that. Just look at Africa. If the perment transfered worked, then some of those countries wouldn't be as poor as they are. Same for southern Europe. They have to take responsibility as a country, and they are not. Instead they are blaming everyone but themselves. Only southern Europe can fix southern Europe. So, more permanent transfers is a bad idea.

I never heard anyone being touchy talking about ""other minorities"". However I can offer my opinion about the Jewish victims.

But let me start with this:

I was not really alive back then but I can offer some anecdotal evidence from the stories floating around. What I heard from my grandparents is that German occupation was a lot better than the Soviet one. Russian soldiers were raping women, killing men, stealing goods. It was horror. However many people had a completely different experience with German soldiers. One story that stuck with me in particular is that when a bunch of German soldiers came to a village they slept in stables along with the animals, were making coffee in the morning and giving away all kinds of sweets to the kids (which was a very rare treat at that time). I even heard that one soldier was shot down by his own general in front of the others after learning that he killed an innocent civilian. 

I am not sure if all this is true, however I found an almost identical portrayal of the Germans in this AMA: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v0nx7/iama_italian_farmer_whose_home_was_occupied_by/c50a00d 

So as far as I am informed German occupation was far less devastating to Lithuanians than Soviet occupation. And a lot of people here don't have any hostile attitudes towards the Germans.

Another thing is this: Soviets were putting a lot of Jews in a positions of power in the occupied Baltic states:

&gt; The genocide rate of Jews in Lithuania, up to 95–97%, was one of the highest in Europe. This was primarily due, with few notable exceptions, to widespread Lithuanian cooperation with the German authorities. Jews were widely blamed for the previous Soviet regime (see Jewish Bolshevism) and were resented for welcoming Soviet troops [WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Lithuania_by_Nazi_Germany#The_Holocaust)


&gt; During the postwar years, Beria supervised the successful establishment of Communist regimes in the countries of Eastern Europe, usually by coup d'etat, and hand-picked the leaders. A substantial number of these leaders were Jews. [WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavrentiy_Beria#Postwar_politics)

Also I've read (can't find a source now) that something like 7 out of 8 top NKVD leaders in Lithuania who were responsible for the deportation of Lithuanians to Siberia were Jewish.

So to me the cold attitude towards the Jewish side of victims comes as no surprise. There were some Jews that played a part in war-crimes. So I imagine a lot of Lithuanians do have hostile feelings towards the Jews. However they cannot express them openly, because of the current post-genocide political climate. And so they are, in your words, ""touchy"" about this subject.

How does this work? There is no wikipedia article on narcology, and what are they doing with needles inside people's brains? Does anyone have some info?   ",0,1380154113,null,0,false,0,ccfgnmc,t3_1n4coj,t1_ccfgnmc,t3_1n4coj,null,1429342008,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Their main function was to work with the European Union and the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to harmonize laws which are in line with EU standards. I spent most of the time talking with different ngo's (there are a lot of them!).

So you understand my perspective, I am a 26 male. The first couple weeks I was there it was really hard to talk to anyone. Everyone seemed distant and wary of strangers. There were even one time where I asked for directions and they looked at me and laughed and carried on their way. However the other times I have asked people were quite accommodating. The key thing here is making friends. Luckily, I was introduced to some Bosnians. Once you are in a social circle it is truly a different experience. They are engaging, talkative, friendly, caring, everything you can imagine. But it was just getting introduced that made all the difference! The girls there are amazing. Your typical Slavic frame and dark hair really caught my interest. Even if a girl were going down the street to get some bread they would be dressed to the nines...heels and everything. The men are not the dainty, clean shaven chaps you'd fine in the U.S., these guys have got thick, hairy chests, deep toned voices, and it seems mostly all of them are balding.

Their English is quite amazing. Everyone in my social circle spoke English at a very high level, but it could vary. This is why I was bummed when I was laughed at when I asked for directions, because everyone under 25 knows English. I noticed a lot of customer service (waiters) did not speak English as great and would become irritated when you spoke it. I remember ordering a Coca Cola and getting a Pepsi and a Jager -- I did not complain. 

The city itself was truly spectacular. Nestled in a valley and surrounded by mountains, Sarajevo really caught my eye. Their market (bascarsijia) was bustling! Everyday this expansive market would be crammed with people who were there to shop, pray, or just take in the scenery. I was there during Ramadan and I thought that this would really hamper the daily/nightly hustle, but instead Ramadan turned Sarajevo into one of the most lively cities I've ever seen. As soon as dusk hit you'd have to penetrate through thick crowds to grab a beer or two. It was awesome. 


I'd really love to go back. I forged close relationships with my Bosnian friends and I miss them dearly. I highly encourage you to go there and check out not only Sarajevo but explore all of BiH!

I've lived in Sweden and you guys are not often of the critical and skeptical type, more like rather gullible.

If you had cared to read about it, you'd see there are many Italians that are very militant against Berlusconi's moves, and are constantly denouncing his shenanigans in any possible way. Sadly, militant minorities are that, minorities, and a TV monopoly gives you a much better speaker than any protest.

true,minnabruna,ASTR,Austria,"I find it upsetting. I appreciate your attempts to explain your perspective and general civility, but I must say that the fact that I am having this conversation at all is an upsetting continuation of at rend I encountered in all three of the Baltic states (I've been to Lithuania and Latvia once and Estonia several times as I go there for work).

Now on to my actual response:

I've heard your argument about nice Germans/bad Soviets before. I find it upsetting. 

The Germans may have been better behaved to non-Jews and other undesired groups at the time.  At the time, I can see how this might have impacted an individual's immediate understanding of the situation.

However, 200,000 people were killed out of a population of three million. It was impossible not to notice that. There are also records of cooperation between Lithuanians and the Germans, both in administration and in the killings. The Vilnius Ghetto was in the capital city. Propaganda was also common. Most people had an idea of what was happening, even if it was not complete. 

If some poor, isolated peasant didn't know any of this at the time, I would be sympathetic to them.  However, it has been 70 years and the history is pretty well known now. Therefore, I have far less time to anyone now who can't find time to be sad that so may people were murdered, and not want to recognize them among their active and public mourning for other losses of the time.

I've also heard the ""Jews were Communists"" argument. A disproportionate amount of Jews were Communist, and not only in Lithuania. Communism, in its ideal form, promised equality to groups like the Jews who were facing social and official prejudice. Communism was also more of an urban ideology, and Jews were disproportionately urban. However, not all Jews were Communists, and when they were murdered, it was because they were Jews. There was no ideological screening, and it wasn't in response to verified, pro-Communist actions. This was an ethnic distinction that no political belief or religious conversion could escape (there is also a history of anti-Semitism in the Baltics that predates Communism). Trying to justify the targeted and murder of an entire community because some of them had political beliefs other than those you want is not excusable. Hearing it so many years later form someone who has the luxury of historical perspective is even more off-putting.

I'm Austrian, from a small town in the mountains. My grandfather found in the war. He was conscripted into the German military at 17, but was happy to go at first - he thought that he would serve his people and save the World from Bolshevism. He was sent to the Eastern Front and came back a very different person, horrified by what he had seen and what he had joined. When he learned about the extent of the Holocaust he was even more heartbroken. 

He and my grandmother also knew what the Soviets could be. They were in our town. They raped my grandmother and shot my grandfather's little brother in the head so that his father would have the memory of watching a son die.  

Yet, with those experiences, both of my grandparents were able to have the perspective, and compassion, to reflect on the crimes of the times and recognize them as such. To see so many people today, in a relatively easy situation and without those experiences, not only ignoring history but seeking to excuse it, it off-putting to say the least.

PS If Austria could do it, Lithuania should do it.

Hopefully the police won't arrest people for walking around in a ski mask during an especially cold winter, but technically the law would be applicable, from what I understand.

There are exceptions, which are the following: wearing a mask for health reasons is okay (maybe ski masks would fall under this, staying warm is about health), as well as wearing a mask for professional reasons, or when taking part in an athletic event, celebrations, or an artistic or traditional event.

In any case, since nuns don't hide their faces, the law doesn't apply to them.

Che il potere del male penetri fino a tal punto nel mondo interiore della fede è per noi una sofferenza che, da una parte, dobbiamo sopportare, mentre, dall'altra, dobbiamo al tempo stesso, fare tutto il possibile affinché casi del genere non si ripetano. Non è neppure motivo di conforto sapere che, secondo le ricerche dei sociologi, la percentuale dei sacerdoti rei di questi crimini non è più alta di quella presente in altre categorie professionali assimilabili. In ogni caso, non si dovrebbe presentare ostentatamente questa deviazione come se si trattasse di un sudiciume specifico del cattolicesimo.""

I didn't mean to upset you. I though I would offer an explanation, but seems to me you already knew most of it. As far as I know you are neither Jewish nor Lithuanian. I don't see why you should be upset by any of this.

&gt; I must say that the fact that I am having this conversation at all is an upsetting continuation of at rend I encountered in all three of the Baltic states.

But didn't it ever occur to you that maybe there is a reason for it? Western Europe was in a very different place during the war. Most of the history was also written from their perspective. The least thing you can do is to hear the experiences of others.

&gt; PPS Why did you start this conversation with ""What victims did you have in mind?""

I was not sure what did you have in mind.

&gt; I've also heard the ""Jews were Communists"" argument. A disproportionate amount of Jews were Communist, and not only in Lithuania. 

It is not the argument that they were communists. The argument is that some of them were responsible for the suffering of many Latvians and Lithuanians. That's the point.

&gt; PS If Austria could do it, Lithuania should do it.

I am not sure what you have in mind. Austria could do it. To make amends for what happened? Neither Russians nor Jews made any excuses for what they did to Lithuanians. If that was your suggestions then it could actually sound a little upsetting to somebody.

I think you didn't carefully consider one thing: the propaganda that is spread by the winners after the war. You name it ""reflection on history"" when in my opinion it is often anything but.

&gt; To see so many people today, in a relatively easy situation and without those experiences, not only ignoring history but seeking to excuse it, it off-putting to say the least.

For an Eastern European it would be off-putting to forget or trivialize the things that were done to us.

I personally think that you would be ignoring part of the history by refusing to acknowledge that almost every nation during the war was both the aggressor and the victim. I don't really understand the Western attitude of ""you should feel and do as I feel and do"". If someone wants to cry about a particular nation - you are free to do it.

German itself, really isnt that hard to learn. Parts of it relate to English, as English is a Germanic language. Sure Dutch may seem more revelant to English but whatever. We just dont have the sounds thats all. I cant get rid of my American accent here, but one things for sure, I can speak with a dialect!

Which ones? The ones about southern Europe payin less taxes or being more corrupt? Or them choosing to vote for corrupt people? Or, the one about the fact that the north have been paying the south for decades (not northern Italy,but southern, I'll admit to that). I'd like for you to scientifically point out where my ""rants"" are wrong. With sources please. 


&gt;Still, sorry we can develop fast enough for your taste. 

So, stop asking for money then. All I ask. Start paying for your own stuff and become net contributors. Why can't Spain do that then if you are so rich? I am all for it, you are rich - so *start paying money instead of receiving*. 

&gt;No, they are not economically on the same level than Italy, Spain, Portugal or even Greece.

No, but they will be. And they have not been on the reciving end of the norts money for decades. They have pulled themselves out. Do you want to take a look at Chinas and Brazils development in comparison to Greece's? [Here](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG), World Bank Data. Look at GDP growth for example. What more, they are doing it on their own, and *not* blaming anyone else.



&gt;In other comment you made some remarks blaming Italians for keeping voting Berlusconi over and over.  I bet you believe your elderlies there in Sweden make the most educated decisions and are immune to TV propaganda. Allow me to doubt it. I've lived in Sweden and you guys are not often of the critical and skeptical type, more like rather gullible.

So, if Italians are not responsible for Berlusconi - who is? Are you saying that they did not vote for him? I'd like scientific proof for that please. Otherwise they *are responsible for him. Or are you saying that people in a democracy is not responsible for their leaders? So, Germany is not responsible for Merkel, and Sweden really didn't elect Reinfeldt, nor did the Brits vote for Cameron? I'd like for you to follow that one up really thoroughly, again with scientific proof of course. Otherwise you are just talking shit. 



&gt; I bet you believe your elderlies there in Sweden make the most educated decisions and are immune to TV propaganda.

Assumptions. I have never said that. Again, you are making idiotic assumptions that you can not prove. How come I am not suprised. 

&gt;llow me to doubt it. I've lived in Sweden and you guys are not often of the critical and skeptical type, more like rather gullible

Doubt your own assumptions about me. Yes, you should do that, since they are idiotic. But you are right, we are gullible, and the south have been milking that and using that for decades. And when someone like me comes along and calls them out you immediately calls me a racist/superios. Well, if they stop being corrupt, start working towards being productive and start paying their taxes, I'll stop calling the south corrupt with low productivity who are voting for assholes. 

However -calling the south sceptical, you are dreaming. If one is sceptical, one do not vote for Berlusconi, again and again. Same for Greece, they have had decades of not If one truly is sceptical and want to improve things, one do not go down the road the Italians and the Greeks have. 

&gt;If you had cared to read about it, you'd see there are many Italians that are very militant against Berlusconi's moves, and are constantly denouncing his shenanigans in any possible way.

Again, you are lying. How do you know I do not care? I have followed the Italian elections, but since you do not care about the truth I guess, I suppose you feel better when you lie. Furthermore, the fact that some Italians are against Berlusconi and his ilkes doesn't matter one shit, when the rest of them keep electing him. It is like the US. What does it matter if some Americans were against Bush from the year 2000. I didn't stop Bush from being elected, invading Iraq despite everyone saying there were no chemcal weapons (and surprisingly enough, Americans, just like you, blame the media instead of taking responsibility themselves. Are you saying that Americans are innocent in the Iraq war, and in the election of Bush? If Italians are innocent, so are they. At the end of the days the American people choose, to elect and re-elect Bush and to invade Iraq and in general behave like a bullying asshole for most of a decade. I hold the Americans responsible for that. Just like I hold Italians responsible for Berlusconi.

So, again, back up with proof what you are claiming. 

Furhtermore, I'd like for you to explain when southern Italy is going to be fixed, and how. I'd also like for you to tell me for how many more decades the north is going to pay for the south, and how much. Also, I'd like for you to extensively explain what has happened with all the billions Greece has received, and where they have gone. 

Furthermore, I'd like for you to answer that when Estonia, and other Baltic states can pull themselves up, out and together to the point that they can pay for Greece, why Greece can't fix themselves? Why can't southern Italy be fixed? 

Also, why are you saying southern Europeans are not responsible for their own countries? Are you claiming that Greek corruption is Finland's fault? And if southern Europe are responsible, why can't you let them take that responsibility? They messed up, they should fix it.

I know who Anne Applebaum is (I agree with you, I like her books) and about Eastern Europe/communism. I do not see what Gulag has to do with Greek corruption. If anything, it just proves that Eastern Europe had it so much worse than southern Europe. 

&gt;My point wasn't that they didn't change and that they are victims.

But all your arguments just proves the case for actually being a victim for Eastern Europe, not for southern Europe, for example Greece and southern Italy.


I do not agree with you that they are victimes - *they are acting like victims, despite not being it*. Everything you have linked to also shows that Eastern Europe had it much worse, and they are acting like victims. Why should southern Italy be a victim. 

And, playing the victim means that they are not trying to fix it, and despite  the situation (some, not everything, no one is responsible for global economy for example, plus the Euro is shit)they are just blaming it on everyone else. *One do not help people like that by giving them money*. One helps them by forcing them to take responsibility. 

&gt;Maybe not play the blame game and victimize individuals that are may as well be just as innocent as you are

Well, as soon as they start taking repsonsibility I'll stop playing the blame game. You do not see me basing Eastern Europe, do you? that is because they do not act and behave like victims. They are trying to fix things. 


&gt;Infringements of EU Directives : http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/docs/docs_infringements/annual_report_29/sg_annual_report_monitoring_eu_law_121130.pdf

I honestly do not understand what you want me to look at in the report. You do know that Italy is the one with most infringements? What are you trying to prove? 

&gt;While there is the euro, that currency is set at an average above the real value of what they currencies of the following countries would be.

I know that, the Euro is a shit currency in a lot of ways and I dislike it. Personally I think Greece, Spain and Portugal should leave. However, that doesn't mean I should pay for them for decades. 

&gt;However, if not the currency union, they would have been stable and not in the awful situation they are in. 

Again, I agree with you, the Euro is an awful currency.

&gt;My point about the transfers of wealth between different areas was that people accept it as a gain for an internal market. I'm sure not all areas in Sweden,Germany,etc. have the same productivity and the same contribution to the national budgets.

Of course not, but it is not the point. We in Sweden are one country, one culture, similar productivity, cultural loyalty, pay as much taxes etc. I don't mind paying taxes towards Gothenburg, (or I might, but I have a chance to influence it) but I dislike intensly paying taxes towards Athens. 

You write like we are one country and that I should be OK with paying for Greece just because we are on the same continent. Why on earth should I do that? The Greeks are responsible for themselves, or at least, they should be. I am not their bloody cash cow. And, even within a country it leads to problems if one area always pay (look at Bavaria for example) Why in God's name should I sign up for paying for countries who just victimizes themselves, refuse to fix themselves, and pay far, far less in taxes, just because we all are in Europe. Hardly. 



&gt;.If you consider it so bad to pay for Greece and Spanish roads with a proportion of your tax dollars, then It would be fair to be as upset about paying for any roads that you may never get to use,such as those in Northern Sweden,which (let's assume,i`ll fact check soon) is a net receiver from the national Swedish budget.

No, because those are a) Swedes that I feel kinship with, and we share history, language, culture. They also pay taxes. *We are one country*. I feel a loyalty and an obligation towards them. I am not in a country with the Greeks. And, if I were to start paying for another countries roads, there are countries in far more need, and being far more gracious and not playing the victim card. So, if I should pay for someone elses roads, that would probably be in Africa. I mean, you want me to pay for another countries roads. What says that I should feel special loyalty towards the greeks? Why? They don't even care about paying taxes and blame everyone else. I'd rather pay for another countries roads. 



&gt;Honestly,I would say that 117 euro seems like a reasonable price for everything the EU does,especially considering that the average gross salary is 3,911 € / 5,279 $, monthly (2006).

No way that is the gross salary. Our gross salary in 2012 was 23000 SEK/month(roughly), just checked it. That is about 2650 Euros/month. Also, remember that we pay the highest taxes in the world on that. 

And saying that it is not a lot - well it depends on things like a) alternative costs for the money. We could use them for increasing our productivity for example or lowering our very, very high taxes. Or investing in environmental causes  b) also, if that means that Greece can continuing *not* collecting their taxes and not being productive, it is a very, very, high cost indeed c) nothing says that our trade would stop with the EU if southern Europe received less money from us. It is just money down the drain, they are not working. Besides, we are actually paying more, through the IMF for example, and we helped bail out Ireland. Also, money spent incorrectly, while we could have spent it better, is always, wrong, always. 


&gt;Italy gives 236.47 and gets 158.11

&gt;France gives 277.50 and gets 202.35****

And, they would give so much more, if the CAP, which I *hate* weren't discriminating northern countries and tailored towards southern needs. We give money to wine and tobacco, and an average Swedish farmer get less for his cows than a French farmer. 

&gt;So Italy , the country that you were specifically mentioning, is actually a giver towards the EU budget and not a receiver.

In the budget, yes, but they would give so much more if a) the stupid CAP stopped b) they fixed southern Italy. If you look at southern Italy, they are not a giver, nor is I believe, southern France. 

In the end, I thank you for the links, although I do not understand the context of most if them. The reason for the state of southern Europe is still shitty, and they are still not fixing it, still playing the victim. I still see now reason or compelling argument why I should pay for them just because we happen to be in the same corner of the world, in particular since they refuse to take any responsibility. 

So, I guess I don't really understand what you are saying, but, just so we are clear, southern Europe are not victims. You still haven't come up with any argument why I should pay for them, not at all. Also, no argument why they shouldn't be held responsible, which they are. 

So, if they are responsible, it only makes sense not to give them more money, not to bail them out, not to fix things for them. Furthermore, what you did forget to answer was that for how long are northern Europe going to pay for them - isn't three decades enough? How are they going to fix themselves, and in what timeframe? I honestly do not believe they will ever do, until we stop sending money there. ",0,1380180510,null,0,false,0,ccfnuke,t3_1n3ivz,t1_ccfnuke,t1_ccfdrhx,null,1429338635,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3

Dieudonné est extrêmement drôle et talentueux. Je crois avoir vu tous ses spectacles et, même s'ils ne se valent pas tous, le niveau est toujours très bon. *Le Divorce de Patrick*, *Mes excuses* et *1905* sont de petits chefs-d'oeuvre. Je dois dire que *Foxtrot* m'a bien fait rire aussi.

Concernant tes inquiétudes, je pense qu'elles sont fondées. Dieudonné a toujours pris le risque d'être récupéré par des gens qui n'ont pas son humour : de virulents antisémites, ultranationalistes et catholiques intégristes. Est-il récupéré ? Je ne sais pas, mais c'est probable.

Cela dit, il est a peu près évident - peut-être suis-je naïf - que l'humoriste sait taper là où ça fait mal. C'est peut-être ce qu'on ne lui pardonne pas. J'en veux pour preuve le passage de *Foxtrot* où il fait allusion à *Golgotha Picnic*, pièce de théâtre artistique et subversive, subventionnée et *Shoahnanas*, bouffonnerie auto-produite : Il le dit lui-même : ""... Je sais, vous avez raison, c'est pas évident..."", dénonçant un ""deux poids, deux mesures"" manifeste. Force est de constater que sur le sujet, il a raison.
Je pense à peu près la même chose que lui : il est de bon ton de cracher sur la catholicisme, l'islam, etc. Par contre, la Shoah, c'est chasse gardée et répréhensible ! Pourtant, comme il le dit à juste titre, il n'a jamais collaboré ou déporté personne.

A major problem in some (rare, but present) cases when we have to deal with violent families that bring crime rates up 500% everywhere they go and terrorize workers that have to maintain and repair their living areas (which are paid for and maintained by the state, at the cost of other citizen).

La conférence est intégralement filmée, mais Soral se la coince durant les ... 2 heures ? durant lesquelles Cardet parle (de manière tout à fait respectueuse d'ailleurs.) 

Jusqu'au moment où un nouveau protagoniste de la supposée machination mondiale du rap travesti est présenté, et que son nom se trouve être juif (je sais plus si c'est Dreyfuss ou Lévy ou whatever mais c'est clairement un nom plutôt juif.) Et là grosse connivence entre le public et Soral, zoom sur la face de ce dernier, sourcils levés, paumes présentées en signe de dédouanement, qui se met à japper ""HA j'ai rien dit !

They aren't very fun people to drink with. I'm sure there are exceptions, but my experience was that they didn't like to cut loose and relax. Amazing beer and wine though!

The second thing is that stupid tax you pay if you have a television in your house. Even if you don't connect it to receive public TV you still have to pay because you just might connect it. It seemed kind of scammy. 

Another thing was the telecoms industry. They all want to lock you into annual contracts rather than allowing you to pay per month. The only provider in Würzburg that had prepaid mobile data without contracts was fonic, and their coverage was atrocious. I had an iPhone 4 at the time and it usually dropped to EDGE rather than give me 3G, and this was within the city. And when I did have 3G it was usually quite slow.

Also, at least in Würzburg, eating out wasn't very enjoyable. There wasn't a lot of variety and the number of restaurants that had actual good food were limited, as most were for tourists and had that heated up factory food. 

Overall, though, I really enjoyed my time there and we're planning on moving there in the future. Bavaria is beautiful and the people there are great. I felt very welcome and I didn't find the people cold. Rather, they seemed to simply be less fake. People didn't pretend to be your best friend as soon as you met them, but they were more themselves. I had many great conversations with people if we found each other interesting.

I think the idea of Germans being cold comes from Americans. I've never been to the US but the Americans I've interacted with have generally been super friendly despite just knowing your name. Very smiley and enthusiastic, so perhaps that's the source of the idea.

The liquidity crisis exists due to the fishy derivatives and overleveraging on the balance sheets of the banks. That is entirely their own responsibility.

Thing about religion is that it goes deeper than going to church/mosque/synagogue/temple and worshiping. Christianity has been shaping european culture for over a millenia and similarly Islam (though not for as long) in Turkey. Holidays, curse words, greetings and to a lesser extent morals and values. Take alcohol for example, Turkey drinks far less alcohol than than every european country. Why? 

&gt;Throughout the history, Turkey (and the Ottomans) always had more relations with European countries than with anyone else. Turkey has more in common with southern/eastern Europe than with middle east. By that I mean historical connections, physical appearance, social values, family structure, world-views etc. And it's not like every single country in Europe have so much in common. Turkey has more in common with, say, Italy than Bulgaria has with Sweeden, for instance.

Youre right not all europe shares the same social values.

&gt;Edit: You said Turks weren't white in another comment. The word ""Turk"" doesn't refer to a race, but to a nation. Turks come in many colors and shapes thanks to various Ottoman conquests around Middle East, Africa and Europe. Add the fact that Turks are originally from Central Asia and you have yourself a very mixed genetic pool.

By white i meant if you pick 100 people from turkey and a 100 people from a european country, how many from both would you clasify as white. Most nations are now an genetic mix.


Why do you want to be European so much? I dont believe europe is better than anywhere else or that Turkey isnt deserving enough to be classed as european. Just when i think ""europe"" i imagine west from the bosphorus and west from (time to piss the russians off) Moscow to the atlantic.

Fortunatamente per me sono sì pirla, ma fino a un certo punto. Ho cominciato a lavorare dopo 6 mesi di università, e ho studiato e lavorato per gli altri 4 e mezzo. E' solo ed esclusivamente grazie alla mia esperienza lavorativa che ora sono col culo al caldo. Io ho mangiato la foglia - tanti, quasi tutti, i miei ex compagni di corso no... adesso o hanno un lavoro vicolo cieco che paga una miseria o passano da uno stage all' altro, sperando di riuscire un giorno a fare l'ingegnere, quello vero, con l'ufficio e 4k al mese.

&gt; Non ho detto che mi ci pulisco il culo. Ho detto che la richiedo, e che purtroppo per i fondi a disposizione non posso offrire più di quella cifra

Allora - prima dici che la laurea triennale vale una sega a scopi lavorativi, poi la richiedi. Dimmi tu, allora com'è che la richiedi? Non puoi prendere uno dei tanti che cercano e hanno voglia di imparare, ma senza laurea?
E' diventato normale pagare un lavoro meno della sussistenza in Italia. Non so perchè. Non so perchè nessuno fa niente. E' la domanda che mi ossessiona - non hai un futuro, ti sputano in faccia e non fai niente? Boh.

&gt; Non voglio fare il matusa ""ai miei tempi ci si faceva più il culo"" o puntare il dito contro gli studenti, anzi. Il sistema a crediti, gli esami a gettone, gli appelli frequenti e ravvicinati, frutto spesso di un sistema il cui unico scopo è sacrificare la formazione per creare cattedre da assegnare a baroni vari, hanno prodotto tutto questo.

Ai tuoi tempi ai giovani si dava la possibilità di crescere. In università onestamente pare si sia sempre imparato un gran poco a quel che mi han sempre detto i miei colleghi. Differenza è che una volta non volevano il giovane neolaureato con 5 anni di esperienza inglese fluente pronto a trasferte all' estero a 1x00 euro al mese.

Della formazione in università non è mai fregato un cazzo a nessuno. E' sempre stato un posto, nel bene o nel male, in cui si fa selezione - se hai fatto ingengeria vuol dire che forse proprio pirla del tutto non lo sei. Problema è che adesso nessuno investe sui giovani o sul talento, tutti vogliono uno che costi poco, risolva il problema e possibilmente poi se ne vada. Dove si va a finire così?

As for the road fires, don't be so fast to blame it on any protester. Leaked internal Police memos published some years ago by newspaper Ta Nea and republished recently by Efimerida ton Syntakton (afaik) show that the Police knows very well that plainclothes officers and Golden Dawn members infiltrate protests to cause trouble and portray them negatively. Which would explain why they still can't find you bombed the Marfin Bank branch. Either way, when people who break the law and cause harm are labelled as anarchists they are promptly arrested (which is good), and they don't receive fair trials, they are kept indefinitely (which is not good). On the other hand, Golden Dawn for 20 years now was an ally of the Police and they worked together. Two days ago even, a police officer shouting GD slogans began shooting among anti-fascist protesters.

C'est faire un anachronisme que de considérer les ""moeurs"" du temps comme aujourd'hui. Les Ottomans c'est 1 état musulmans dans le monde arabe. Qui n'était pas exempte de progroms ou pire. En plus si les massacres étaient le fait des chrétiens, ils étaient condamné par l'Eglise, que ce soit les juifs ou les autres. 

Les cathos sont autant dominant aujourd'hui en Europe que le PCF, un truc veillot que plus personne ne regarde comme crédible. L'Eglise a fait de la merde, les états chrétiens ont fait de la merde, et le plus souvent cela n'avait rien à voir avec la foie chrétienne. Et à leur actifs l'idéologie d'égalté, de respect de tout les hommes (que l'on retrouve aussi chez les musulmans, malgré des ambiguité envers divers groupe), l'école de théologie de Salamanque qui fonde juste l'esprit des lumières un siècle avant l'heure etc... font que pour ma part si comme toute religions et institutions je critique l'Eglise, les principes qui gravitent autour de la fois catholique restent pour certains valable. 

Ensuite les musulmans sont certes peu ou prou ""discriminer"" ici, mais dans les pays à dominance ils sont tout autant un outil de domination, d'hégémonisme et de coercition sociale (et même à present incomparablement plus important que les cathos chez nous) sans commune mesure.

I was not being a smartass, just pointing out that motorcycles are inherently dangerous outside of circuits - in traffic.

Non è proprio questo il punto? Tutte queste cose le puoi fare - meglio - *da solo* senza dover andare in università.

&gt; 1100 euro non sono meno della sussistenza, per un primo impiego senza esperienza, ti assicuro, almeno non a Trieste.

Fai conto di 400-500 euro di affitto, 200 mensili per la macchina, 100 di corrente/altre spese, 200 per mangiare - quanti te ne rimangono? Certo, se per sussistenza intendi vivere a casa del papi e la macchina la pagano i tuoi allora si. E sono tutti numeri ""corti"" quelli che ho citato, e assolutamente niente extra, neanche una birra al bar il sabato.

&gt; Posso anche prendere uno che non ha la laurea e ha voglia d'imparare, se però poi devo perdere un anno a spiegargli cos'è un genoma e perchè incrociando la linea di topi A con la linea B la probabilità di ottenere un fenotipo desiderato è del 12.5%, non sopravvivo. Tuttavia, se trovassi qualcuno VERAMENTE determinato ed entusiasta, lo prenderei anche senza laurea, ti confesso. 

Puoi prendere uno che ha fatto 5 anni al professionale - probabilmente lo sa cos'è un genoma.

&gt; Ai miei tempi (che poi non son tanto diversi da questi, mi son laureato nel 2005, io) finita la laurea, pacca sulla spalla e vai a crepare in strada. Specie con una laurea in Scienze Naturali, come la mia, fatta per passione. Quindi non farmi il discorso da giovane che combatte col mondo del lavoro a vecchio barone privilegiato, non lo sono. 

Io non combatto proprio un cazzo, io sono scappato. Il problema è che è una follia buttare in mezzo a una strada uno che ha studiato per 20 anni - in Italia stanno gettando le basi per quello che sarà un disastro sociale credo mai visto da noi. E offrire 1100 euro e pensare che sia giusto vuol dire, secondo me, collaborare.

&gt; Di ingegneri pirla ne conosco parecchi, anyway.

Anch' io. Per questo il *probabilmente*. E in ogni caso la selezione già quando frequentavo io lasciava molto a desiderare (io studiavo regolarmente il giorno prima e passavo).

&gt; Adesso c'è uno scazzo e un disinteresse per la materia studiata micidiale.

La domanda che ci si dovrebbe fare è *perchè?*. Qual è l' incentivo che ha uno adesso di 18 anni a studiare? Conosco tantissima gente di 20x anni che studia perchè è meglio che stare a casa a fare niente... sapendo benissimo di avere già scritto ""disoccupato"" in fronte il giorno che la laurea è presa.
Se, anche se studi, la società di ringrazia con un bel calcio nei coioni cosa sei scemo tu a buttar via 5 anni di fatiche?

&gt;  Il vero bonus dell'università, che quasi nessuno coglie, è la possibilità di fare networking, di inserirti in contesti aziendali (tirocinio in azienda, anyone?)

Il ""fare networking"", come lo chiami tu, è l'unico modo sicuro di avere un lavoro al momento. Problema è che per tutto il ""networking"" che puoi fare tu, se non c'è papi che alza il telefono te ne stai seduto in panchina come gli altri 100 stronzi che come te non hanno un santo in paradiso.

Per le aziende, per cui ho lavorato prima di andarmene, gli stagisti universitari sono diventati ""manodopera non specializzata gratis"". Gli sputano ovviamente addosso anche (*ahah questo qua ha studiato mille anni e non sa fare un cazzo*).

Well, if you haven't squandered them - why are you not net contributors? Empires have been built and lost in less time than southern Europe can become net contributors. And, the Greece has been on the receiving end since **1981**. How can one manage *not* to become a net contributors and still have such low productivity as they have? Are they not responsible for *not* building up their country. [Here](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG), take a look at the GDP growth in some other countries. Check Brazil, China, Estonia. Why are southern Europe so bad?  Are you not responsible for that? Whos fault is it then? Is nothing ever your fault? Have you no responsibility for your economy and your politicians? Then who does? 

If you haven't managed it in 30 plus years, it is not very likely you are going to change. 


&gt;What is with you and Estonia? Estonia, that has grown a lot and I'm very happy for them, is still poorer that Greece (check its numbers). Estonia is still a net receiver of European funds.

I know!. And I do not mind paying for them, at all. They are improving and dealing with their shit. They are not being bailed out, not blaming anyone else, and *bailed out Greece*. When Greece entered the EU and started to receive their first batch of money *Estonia didn't exists*. That means that countries can improve, if they work hard and stop being corrupt, pay taxes and stop playing the victim. Link of course. [Link](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/29/business/estonia-pm-marketplace-europe/index.html). So why the fuck can't Greece act like Estonia? 

&gt;You wouldn't be so happily blaming Italians if you were aware that that kind of shit can happen in many places, not just Italy. I'm making assumptions based on your comments.

I am making assumptions to, made on your comments. You are one of those people who refuse to take responsibility. And, despite evidence for how fucked up Greece and Italy are, you just want northern Europe to pay them more money, and you are saying it is not their fault. You are actually saying that people in a democracy are not responsible for anything their elected politicians do, nor are they responsible for their economy, or anything. Apparently, you think southern Europe are not responsible for anything. It is never the fault of southern Europe according to you. Apparently, unlike other countries, they are not responsible for what happens. 

&gt;I don't believe southerners are specially skeptical.

No shit, they voted for Berlusconi. 

&gt;Ever worse, you are lying to make Southern European countries and its people look bad

I haven't lied. I have said that they are more corrupt, have lower taxes and far worse at paying them, that they vote for assholes, and have low productivity.I'll prove everything! [Here](http://www.transparency.org/cpi2012/results), the corruption index. Sweden is in top five, Greece is 94. Please, prove me wrong then. Are you saying that southern Europe is not more corrupt than northern? Links please then, otherwise, you are, as always, lying.

[Tax rates](http://www.therichest.com/business/the-top-ten-countries-with-the-highest-tax-rates/) Where the fuck is southern Europe on that. The widespread corruption that I just proved, also means that you don't even pay your lower taxes. 

Assholes- Berlusconi. Rest my case, but it is not hard to dig up more corrupt assholes.

Productivity. - http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=LEVEL. Again, look at southern Europe.

So, I have *proven* every single one of my claims.

&gt;Yes, I do believe Americans are innocent of the Iraqi war and they are not to blame for it

So you mean that despite that their democratically elected president, senate and house of representatives said yes, they have nothing to do with it? You can't even have read Politics 101 then. Actually, that is one of the most important points of democracy - you are responsible. That *you* do not think that do not suprise me however, but you are of course, wrong, and have nothing factual to back you up, of course. 


&gt;that you are an anti-South Europe bigot.

Oh, demanding that people take responsibility makes me a bigot. I can see that *you*, who refuse to take any responsibility whatsover, see it that way. Demanding that they stop being corrupt and stop electing assholes make me a bigot? I can see that it must be hard for you, paying taxes.....

&gt;you are not willing to challenge your bigotry with the facts.

I have backed it up. Every singel one of them. Now apologize, you asshole, or *prove* that Greece is not corrupt and that Spain pay far more in taxes than we do and that Portugal is productive. Not that you can, you asshole. You just rant, wanting to avoid actually saying""We fucked up,we should fix it.

Coding is this rather strange thing that you always keep hearing about when you visit your grandmother: ""Oh, have you heard, your uncle Arthur* got coded again?"" (*Uncle names may vary)  
As it says in the article - it's a suggestion-based method, the suggestion being ""you drink - you die"" kind of thing. From what I gather, coding is sort of like hypnosis, and it should help you feel aversion to alcohol for a period of time (Coding for 1 year costs about 75 Euro in Lithuania, coding for 5 years - 200+ Euro). There are, of course, many similar methods to fight alcoholism. For example, getting a ""torpedo"" which is, traditionally, sewn under the skin. If someone starts drinking while having the torpedo, rumour has it, the poison will be released into the body, killing the person (again, the ""you drink - you die"" principle). While I think, it mostly just causes nausea and digestive troubles.  

The biggest question is - does it work? 

It does not work, if you do not make it work. Coding is just part of the treatment, although many people view it as the easy way out, and that is a terrible approach to the problem. It's easy to get a code, but what good does a year of sobriety do, if the situation that led to alcoholism hasn't changed? I've read about many cases where a person who stopped drinking for 2-3 years while the code was still ""active"", started drinking immediately after, and in many cases, the situation only got worse (maybe it's just me, but I think it has a lot similarities with people overdosing when they start using drugs after a long sobriety, because they usually use the same amount they used before quitting, at the same time forgetting that the body is no longer used to that amount). These people do not look forward to getting better - they look forward to the code expiring. The final outcome of these treatments really depends on the support of family and close friends and on the people themselves. If I do not aceept that I have a problem, no amount of coding or torpedoes, or other treatments will help me.  
I'm not sure if anyone in my family used coding. I believe, my mother's brother might have, because he was in a pretty bad shape and then sobered up quickly. Not for long, unfortunately.  
So, this is my rather simplistic view on coding and narcology. I do hope someone could explain everything better.",0,1380191445,null,0,false,0,ccfp3lo,t3_1n4coj,t1_ccfp3lo,t1_ccfgnmc,null,1429337980,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

You are referring to anarchists. Anarchists are not Syriza and KKE (political opposition) and they didn't increase in number in any noticeable way. 

&gt; edit: Have you ever wondered that apart of the failed Greek society, the rising of leftish anarchists or extremist left groups caused the rise of GD as a political party ? Have you ever asked yourself that violence only leads to more violence ? ... the harsh reality is that Greece killed Fyssas because it didn´t stopped the rise in the first place, of extremist of leftwing extremists or anarchist groups.

Golden Dawn existed and murdered people in cooperation with the police for 20 years now. They are not new. Fyssas is already old news. Golden Dawn attacked 3 more people in the last week. The road for Golden Dawn was paved by the media since the 90s. 

What left-wing extremists risen in Greece? Anarchists are pretty much who they were. They don';t run in elections so we can't have an accurate number, but there isn't any noticeable increase in anarchist attacks against ""statist targets"". Extremist left political groups? Which? The post radical leftwing party Greece has is ANTARSYA, and they are a tiny party, only elected one mayor or so. And ""democratic socialism"" is not an extremist ideology anyway. The only party to rise is Syriza, but they are not extremist in any sense. They are a carbon copy of PASOK in the 80s. PASOK was a near-centrist party. 

Noone who claimed that ""left wing parties are at fault for the rise of Golden Dawn"" managed to say why yet. Can you? 

And anarchists remained the same they always were, and don't you worry, the police is taking care of them zealously, they are not out of control.

* Receiving EU funds: when countries join the EU they have to open their national markets to the more competitive EU market, meaning a lot of companies that survived on protectionism will quickly disappear without a chance of becoming more productive. That happened with Easter European industry or Spanish mining. EU funds are little more than a ""bribe"" to these countries, so they dismantle these sectors. Of course, once dismantled they: 1. Stop producing cheap stuff that could compete with other more industrial countries (guess which ones); 2. Start buying those goods from those countries (may this have something to do with certain heavily exporting-focused economy in central Europe?). I will add here something about productivity: productivity is not really about being a hard worker or working ""smart"" Productivity is mainly about having industry. A dude controlling a robot that makes a few 30000€ cars a day is way more productive that the best waiter in the world. Tourism and service-based economies will never be as productive as industry-based ones. Productivity=money made by worker. BMW=lots of money/few workers. Hotel=meh money/lots of workers.

* Selling debt: many northern European countries and banks are buying Spanish and Italian debt. They don't do this for charity, that debt has a very succulent interest (much higher months ago) and will end up being very profitable. If you want Sweden to stop buying our debt that's fine, but that would be a pretty stupid decision.

* Being bailed out: being bailed out is basically being saved from bankruptcy by someone who can do it and believe your bankruptcy may hurt them worse than paying you that money. Countries may bail out banks (as Sweden did in the 90's) so their citizens don't lose their savings. Greece or Ireland (but not Spain nor Italy) have been bailed out for fear of what could have happened to the Euro. Here I surprisingly agree with you, the Euro was a mistake, specially for countries like Spain and Italy that now have no control of their own currency, while others (well Germany, probably not even France) do. Again, bailouts are not result of charity but fear of losing what is a very profitable tool for some countries.

Just one note more, about corruption. Those are *perception* index. I don't doubt there's less corruption in richer countries like Sweden or Norway. People up there live nice lives so why would they risk prison by being corrupt? But still, if you believe there's no corruption at the government level you are making a point about Nordic naivety.

Intanto, se definiamo fondamentalismo il cieco attaccamento alla lettera di un testo, allora, *in questo senso*, la Chiesa non è stata così fondamentalista come la dipinge la propaganda anti-clericale, che troppo spesso usa come modello di ""religioni"" (cringe), in modo del tutto incongruo ed inadeguato, il modello di religiosità ammerregana, che tende al fondamentalismo, nel senso appena definito.

Anzi, sin dagli inizi della sua teologia, che è stata fortemente influenzata dalla scuola filosofica alessandrina, presso la Chiesa, i vari punti ""scomodi"" (tipo l'antropomorfismo della divinità così come appare nell'A.T.) sono stati spesso interpretati in chiave allegorica, cosa che peraltro le ha permesso di vedere prefigurati, negli episodi veterotestamentari, l'avvento di Gesù, nonché altre dottrine che noi ora diamo per scontate come gli angeli, la loro ""caduta"", il diavolo, ecc.

Quindi così è rimasta fedele al testo sacro *in toto*, anche, ma non solo, in reazione allo gnostico Marcione, e anzi ne vede il *vero* (sì lo so, abbi pazienza) significato nascosto della rivelazione. La sua interpretazione poi la adottò in quanto vera, ma poi si pose il problema di come approcciarsi alle altre, le cosiddette eresie.

Nella tarda antichità, quando la Chiesa non era un'autorità centralizzata, gli eretici erano coloro che avevano compiuto una scelta (in greco αἵρεσις, da cui ""eresia"") dottrinale, che era una come un'altra delle tante possibili. Il problema sorse quando il vescovo di Roma si sentì il diritto di avere l'autorità sugli altri e la Chiesa divenne di fatto la prosecuzione dell'autorità imperiale, a mio vedere, e quindi un vero e proprio regno.

Gli eretici bruciati nel Medioevo e all'inizio dell'età moderna divennero quindi coloro che mettevano in discussione, in ultima analisi, l'autorità della Chiesa, che a questo punto era uno Stato a tutti gli effetti (contrariamente a quello che diceva Gesù, se vogliamo): coloro che professavano dottrine assolutamente incompatibili non tanto con i testi sacri, ma con la strumentalizzazione da essa compiuta finivano per essere bruciati in quanto minaccia all'autorità.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;This comment is actually for you, because I believe you confuse a few concepts: receiving EU funds, selling debt and being bailed out:

No, I am not. I know the differences you are talking about. Greece has received EU (EG)funds since 1981, they are still net receivers, 32 years later. Greece are in addition to the money they are receiving, being bailed out by the troijka.Before I started to study environmental issues, I studied economics for two years, I have no problem with the issues. 

So, I know a lot about what you are talking about. For example, the Swedish bail out of banks is often seen as a model bail out and the opposite of what the Euro countries did btw....

For the record, I do not like the Euro, it is the most imperfect of currencies, and I think Spain, Greece and Portugal should leave, but that is a discussion for another day. That does not diminish the fact that southern Europe is far, far less productive, despite the investments they get from the EU, far more corrupt, and seemingly determined to stay that way, and far less inclined to pay their smaller taxes. 

Nor does it change the fact that *you* think that somehow southern Europe is in no way responsible for that. Just out of curiosity - who is then? And, who is going to fix it then? For how many decades are they going to be on the receiving end? 


&gt;Just one note more, about corruption. Those are perception index

I know that. However, it is the best and the most widespread that exists. Get another one then, that is better. You also should understand that it lies in the nature of corruption that one can never get exact numbers. So, this is the best and the most widespread - it holds up for scrutiny. Again, you said I lied, I proved you wrong. 

&gt; I don't doubt there's less corruption in richer countries like Sweden or Norway.

So why call me a liar? You are the liar.

&gt;People up there live nice lives so why would they risk prison by being corrupt?

You are making up the reasons now. That is not a scientific answer, and it is not a correct one. In fact, the willingness to pay taxes have far more to do with a trust in society actually, but I am not going to do your work for you. Also, with that sort of reasoning, no one who has a nice life in Greece ever needed to be corrupt, for example rich people. I think they are corrupt too (and if one should believe the Greeks on this board, more so than ordinary people), so your reasoning do not hold, not one bit. You do not get to the level on being 94 without the *whole* country being involved. I can't find that number, but I read that the average Greek paid 1500 Euros in bribes each year before the crises.......Hundred here to the tax man, hundred to the doctor...Obviously, on average and I don't have the energy to find the quote at the moment. 

&gt; But still, if you believe there's no corruption at the government level you are making a point about Nordic naivety. 

I have never said that there were none, just far far less.I belive that there is corruption in every country. In Sweden too. I could write angry rants about that, but that is a) not the issue here b) I do that at r/Sweden. Again, stop putting words in my mouth. 

Please answer who you think is responsible for the state of southern Europe if not the southern Europeans. 

However, we do not willingly vote for it, like the Italians for example To elect and re-elect Berlusconi, that is not a people willing to fight corruption.

Just random information in addition to this that jumps around in my head (I am an environmentalist/biologist after all). 

With regards to the falcons, it also has to do with less reducing the poison in nature etc, not just protecting the habitats. So, a brilliant example how the whole society has to work together to protect species. 

Never ever underestimate bird lovers. Animal lovers have a lot to learn from them. Most of the issues/habitats that has been protected throught the EU, are bird habitats. Ornitologist are phenomenal at a) keeping records and b) going to court and winning their cases. I am just waiting for them to take on Malta. (who kill millions of birds for no reason every years, many of them protected species)....


It is also important to protect species, not just re-introduce them. The genetics are often different, and loosing an original species, we loose genetic diversity. 

Sweden are idiots when it comes to wolves....We can sustain more, but we refuse too.

true,Frensoa,ZZZZZZchatf,Chatf,"Le gros problème dans ton discours et dans celui de pas mal de représentants de l'antisionisme en général, c'est le mélange des genres.

D'après mes connaissances, et si j'en crois wikipedia, le sionisme est, je cite, ""une idéologie politique [...] prônant l'existence d'un centre spirituel, territorial ou étatique peuplé par les Juifs en Terre d'Israël"". Grosso modo, c'est l'idée qu'il doit y avoir un Etat juif sur le territoire de la Palestine/Israel. C'est une idée **politique**. Je suis d'accord avec toi pour dire qu'elle a apporté beaucoup de malheurs et qu'il est légitime de s'insurger contre elle.

En revance, là où je ne te suis plus du tout, c'est quand tu mélanges politique et communauté, idéologie et terrorisme. Quand tu me dis que le sionisme est un terrorisme, je ne suis pas d'accord du tout : on peut imaginer vouloir un Etat juif en Palestine, sans pour autant que ça implique de tuer des gens. On peut considérer que la communauté juive est aussi légitime là-bas au regard de l'histoire que la communauté palestinienne/arabe, sans pour autant vouloir opprimer les palestiniens. On aurait pu imaginer une bien meilleure réalisation du projet sioniste. Un Etat unique qui reconnaisse les deux religions comme religion d'Etat, un partage moins injuste des territoires, etc. Je suis d'accord qu'en l'état actuel, les israeliens oppriment les palestiniens, c'est une honte, et ça doit cesser. Mais dire qu'être sioniste, c'est comparable aux islamistes radicaux, c'est biaiser le débat et l'envenimer encore plus qu'il ne l'est actuellement.

Ensuite, en termes de mélange des genres, je suis toujours choqué de voir que les anti-sionistes reprennent un discours aussi proche de l'antisémitisme. Si on remplaçait le mot ""sioniste"" par ""juif"" dans 90% des discours des Soral et autres Dieudonné, l'illusion serait parfaite, on serait en 1936 dans certains milieux nauséabonds. Quand tu parles de ""communauté"", je suis désolé, mais je ne pense pas à un courant politique (le sionisme), je pense, bah, à une communauté (les juifs). Quand je vois Dieudo donner un prix à Faurisson, je ne lis pas prioritairement ""la loi Gayssot est peut-être un peu trop forte, je souhaiterais insérer à l'ordre du jour de l'assemblée nationale son abrogation"", je lis d'abord et avant tout ""je n'ai pas peur de mettre en valeur quelqu'un qui nie l'un des événements les plus évidents, les plus tragiques et les plus importants de notre histoire récente par haine d'une communauté"". Je vois que Dieudonné établit un lien entre négationnisme et anti-sionisme, entre antisémitisme et anti-sionisme. C'est désolant. Après, est-ce du domaine de la loi ou non de condamner ce genre de trucs, ça se discute. Par contre, ce qui est évident, c'est que c'est au mieux très maladroit, au pire mal intentionné (faire le pont entre anti-sionisme, qui est une idée politique légitime dans le débat public, et antisémitisme, dans le but que les gens intéressés par le premier s'engouffrent dans le second).

Quand tu finis ton post par ""maintenant, si tu ne te rends pas compte de la sur-representativite de cette communaute dans les medias et la politique, je ne peux rien pour toi"", revois ton vocabulaire. Tu seras beaucoup mieux entendu si tu arrêtes de parler d'une idée politique avec les termes qui s'appliquent à une religion ou à une communauté.",0,1380196903,null,0,false,0,ccfptl7,t3_1n5evl,t1_ccfptl7,t1_ccfp8lk,null,1429337644,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

There's really no such thing a Swedish history.You're acting like Sweden has existed the way it is now for ever,that at no time has it been speaking a different language, had a different territory or a different culture.


This is what it really boils down to.Your lack of empathy towards other people that you feel that are not as same as you, distancing and dehumanizing them.The economics and political arguments and just an excuse so you can believe what you want to believe. 




&gt;In the budget, yes, but they would give so much more if a) the stupid CAP stopped b) they fixed southern Italy. If you look at southern Italy, they are not a giver, nor is I believe, southern France.

I'm sorry,but you keep victimizing Italy so much. I would think that the fact that they are giving more money than taking is enough to stop blaming. As long as it concerns your national interests,Italy has nothing broken to fix and is giving you money. The notion that you need to fix Southern Italy and make it a contributor is unrealistical and if you demand that Southern Italy has a net budget of 0 then it would be fair to have region x of Sweden (which let's assume is a huge receiver from the swedish national budget) reduce its budget deficit to 0 as well. But that's just not how it works, and you refuse to acknowledge this.

Furthermore, the reason why you should have to pay 120 something euro per year for Athens is simple : Internal Market. 


&gt;So, if they are responsible, it only makes sense not to give them more money, not to bail them out, not to fix things for them. Furthermore, what you did forget to answer was that for how long are northern Europe going to pay for them - isn't three decades enough? How are they going to fix themselves, and in what timeframe? I honestly do not believe they will ever do, until we stop sending money there.

Again. You make it seem like I somehow try and make excuses for Southern Europe. No. I agree fully that they need reforms.I agree that the CAP is awful. 

However, I've given you the exact numbers of how much this all costs. You seem to be on a witch hunt without looking to see if the people you want to burn are actually witches or not. Italy,which you despise so much, even sends you money.France too. The total amount of money that was,let's say invested or wasted, in the countries you accuse is not sufficient to ask for such a response. 

I'm with you and they should fix things. But you have a very unbalanced, unreasonable and un-factual fanaticism going against them. 

Note: The notion of how much are we going to keep paying for those Southerns is factually incorrect.France and Italy and net contributors.You are paying more for Eastern Europe than you're paying for South Europe. 

If you demand that your money stops being wasted on Southern Italy everyone else has the right to ask that their money does not go to x area of Sweden either. This is really a geographical issue and not a nationality / ethnic / cultural issues as you make it sound to be.

La vidéo mentionne bien ""citation sujette à polémique"", mais devrait plutôt indiquer qu'il s'agit d'un document inventé de toutes pièces par les fascistes américains.

Un antisioniste n'aurait jamais utilisé ce genre de document, seul un antisémite l'aurait fait.

Depending on the kind of map, we account for many details like the scattering of light by molecules and aerosols, the extinction along light paths, the atmospheric aerosol content, the Earth curvature, the altitude of each area, the mountain screening, the observed sky direction, the natural sky brightness, the stellar extinction, the eye capability.

One parameter not accounted for in the calculation is the increase of the stellar extinction with the zenith distance, i.e. the extinction of starlight is greater near the horizon than in the zenith.

And we all, including you, come from Africa. There is no such thing as Europe and European history then either. Also, there is no reason why Greece should be in line for receiving money, or why I should feel any kinship with European countries. So, they can start fending for themselves, which they are not. Besides *you* were the ones who brought up Napoleonic wars, or from what I will now call them  -the African civil war......


&gt; Your lack of empathy towards other people that you feel that are not as same as you.The economics and political arguments and just an excuse so you can believe what you want to believe. 

What?I could say the same to you? Why aren't you paying for the roads in Africa? Why aren't you giving 10 % of your GDP towards people who needs it, more than you. After all, we are all just humans, with no European history that came from Africa. If there is no Sweden, there is bloody hell no Europe, no Greece, and no reason for bailouts, I hope you see that. 

And, I do not lack in empathy. It is just that I, unlike you do not automatically think it means that I have to pay for them for decades, which I have already done btw. Furthermore, it can actually be bad to just paying for someone and never let them fix stuff themselves. One could say that *you* are the one who lacks empathy - you do not want southern Europe to learn, to fix themselves. 

&gt;No. I agree fully that they need reforms.I agree that the CAP is awful. 

So what will the consequences be if they do not fix themselves. How will they be punished? 


&gt;The notion that you need to fix Southern Italy and make it a contributor is unrealistical 

Why can't southern Italy be a net contributor to the EU. Scientific reasons please. I think Sweden have every region being a contributor, and I think at least the Dutch have the same. Why not every region in Italy? 

&gt;However, I've given you the exact numbers of how much this all costs.

No, just the EU numbers, we haven't even started on the bailout numbers....But however, I admit, that was very nice of you. Thanks. 

&gt;Note: You are paying more for Eastern Europe than you're paying for South Europe.

Certainly not with the bailouts. Not that we pay more for that than we have to, but ask the Finns. They hate the bailouts. Or, Estonia, poorest country in the Euro, who bailout Greece, number 94 on the corruption list..... And, we are paying through IMF too, btw,And, now they want to use EU funds (they already have) for use espcially for Greece, although the funds were not meant for that.So, they will have more investments.  

Also, Eastern Europe haven't been on the receiving end since 1981, some of them didn't exist then. I'd be extremely suprised if Estonia wasn't a net contributor in the next 20 years, then it will be the same time Greece has been in the EU. I don't think Greece will be a contributor then. Do you think that Greece will be a net contributor in 20 years?  

&gt; But you have a very unbalanced, unreasonable and un-factual fanaticism going against them. 

I am sorry, I have backed it up, and I do not understand why it is unreasonable about asking people to stop being corruptive, stop voting for assholes, become productive members of a union instead of taking from it and start paying taxes. If that is unresonable, I am guilty. 

&gt;I'm with you and they should fix things.

Good, everyone says so, but they never do. What should one do when they refuse to fix things?  So saying that they should is like saying that the skye is blue. The question is how, and should we pay for it? What do you think? Also, how much should we pay, why should we pay (I mean, I do not feel more kinship with the Greeks than I do with my fellow Africans) and for how long. Why can't they just fix themselves? 

Greece have had 30 years, and is worse than ever. So, at some point one has to say - these countries choose this and cut our losses, as in not give them more money, not bail them out etc. Or, tell me, which you haven't answered - **How are you going to fix them? How many more years are then going to be net reipients, not payer? How many decades or should I say generations**. You have to admit, that if they had wanted to change, they would have. So, most likely they will not. Then one has to decide what to do with them. I say - no more money.

Bon ça ne serait déjà pas très sérieux pour quelqu'un se voulant leader d'opinion. Sauf que s'agissant de Soral, il existe une véritable montagne d'éléments de ce genre, de citations antisémites, de bouquins notoirement antisémites réédités dans sa maison d'édition, sans compter que la grande majorité des événements mondiaux ou sociétaux s'expliquent selon lui par un présumé complot judéo-maçonnique.

Un enseignement dont on peut voir les effets sur Dieudonné dans ce merveilleux Tumblr: http://uncomplotsioniste.tumblr.com/

**[edit]** Voila quelques citations que j'avais glanées lors du visionnage de quelques vidéos de Soral:

* ""Depuis la nuit du 4 aout et le procès de Dreyfus le catholicisme ne cesse de se faire piétiner""
* ""On verra tout à l'heure dans l'évangile de Matthieu pourquoi on devrait ranger le Christ parmi les antisémites. C'est l'antisémite en chef Jesus-Christ""
* ...L'antifrance talmudo maconnnique qui est la clé de tout le reste
* ""J'ai pu constater une fois de plus cette lente domination sur la  France au nom de la laïcité en fait du judaïsme, je pense qu'on peut le dire clairement, finalement derriere la republique il y a la loge maçonnique et derriere la loge maçonnique il y a le temple de Salomon, c'est une vérité historique, sociologique et théorique, c'est pas moi qui le dis""
* ""Le juif antisémite c'est ce qu'il y a de mieux, ce sont les plus intelligents, les plus fins, ce sont les meilleurs des hommes""

**[edit 2]** En me relisant, je vois que je n'ai pas parlé de la réaction de Soral à la première citation faussement attribuée à Benjamin Franklin et clairement antisémite. Après cette citation franchement ignoble, on entend clairement Soral dire: ""Voila il disait ce qui allait se passer 2 siècles après, je vous laisse faire votre commentaire dans votre for intérieur"".

2. The women flood the toilets of every gas station. Like literally. They say they ""wash"" themselves but the truth is the flood the toilets-they throw panties, bottles, tampons and all kinds of shit there. 

3. Tell that to the young girls wearing burqas.

Actually that's hardly true. You were screwing with our trade routes mostly. That's why people started looking for India by sea(and found America) you know. Because the Ottomans would screw with us and attack us all of the time.

A Southern European myself I disagree with that. Vastly. You had historical connections with everyone. India can probably claim they had a lot of historical connections with Europe because they were a British colony. Physical appearance? Yeah, keep dreaming buddy. Turks don't really classify as white. You are more akin genetically to Middle Easterners. I already spoke of the social values I have witnessed.

&gt;Turkey has more in common with, say, Italy than Bulgaria has with Sweden, for instance.

Not how Italians see it. We even have a proverb- ""Mamma i turchi"". The name of the Turks was spoken with fear because they would devastate, murder and rape every village on Italian shores they could get their fingers on. Italy has nothing in common with Turkey. We are completely in Europe geographically. We are Christian(or atheist), we are white, we have Western culture(and could claim being one of it's founders.

true,NewZealandLawStudent,null,null,"Well, it's a complicated economic question which I don't know the answer too, and I suspect nobody really does.

The reason that the UK doesn't lead in manufacturing anymore is that other places, such as China, have huge built in advantages - lower wages, higher populations, lax environmental protections, close supplies chains etc. It would be possible for the UK to compete, but frankly, I don't see the point. The UK has a really high standard of living, high wages, good employment etc. 

Where the UK still competes in manufacturing is mostly the high tech areas - weapons, health, high end auto, and for some reasons vacuum cleaners, etc. These are mostly fields which require an academic background. 

When comparing the UK to Germany (which is a bit stupid anyway, people mostly look at raw numbers and Germany is about a third larger than the UK), we're comparing the UK to the literal global leader which specialises massively to something which we don't specialise in. It's ok not to be winning. We're better than them at other stuff, and that's why we make huge amounts in exporting that stuff. Even then, we're still pretty damn good at high end manufacturing.

Ultimately, yeah, we could do more manufacturing and have a greater industrial base. It would result in the british having shittier jobs for less pay, the country making less from exports, and a general decline in the standard of living. If the only reason is for full employment there are better ways to achieve that - large public works projects or simply paying out a basic living wage. With increasing automation employment from manufacturing will decline fairly steeply anyway (along with pretty much every other kind of employment, especially low skill service).

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"Night sky brightness is indeed very closely correlated with number of stars visible. And judging the paper by it's title alone is not valid critisism as it's the content of the paper that is of interest. If you read bit further to the abstract you'll see what the paper is about:
&gt; We apply the sky brightness modelling technique introduced and developed by Roy Garstang to high-resolution satellite measurements of upward artificial light flux carried out with the US Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System and to GTOPO30 (a global digital elevation model by the US Geological Survey’s EROS Data Centre) digital elevation data in order to predict the brightness distribution of the night sky at a given site in the primary astronomical photometric bands for a range of atmospheric aerosol contents. This method, based on global data and accounting for elevation, Earth curvature and mountain screening, allows the evaluation of sky glow conditions over the entire sky for any site in the world, to evaluate its evolution, to disentangle the contribution of individual sources in the surrounding territory and to identify the main contributing sources. **Sky brightness, naked eye stellar visibility and telescope limiting magnitude are produced as three-dimensional arrays, the axes of which are the position on the sky and the atmospheric clarity. We compare our results with available measurements.**

The site has numerous papers about the subject, and also numerous maps reflecting different variables:  
The World Atlas of sea level artificial night sky brightness  
Maps of the artificial night sky brightness  
Maps of the total night sky brightness  
Maps of the naked eye stellar visibility  
Maps of the number of visible stars  
Maps of the growth of light pollution  
Maps of the night sky in selected sites  

If interested you could also read this other relevant paper: **Naked eye star visibility and limiting magnitude mapped from DMSP-OLS satellite data**
&gt; We extend the method introduced by Cinzano et al. (2000a) to map the artificial sky brightness in large territories from DMSP satellite data, in order to map the naked eye star visibility and telescopic limiting magnitudes. For these purposes we take into account the altitude of each land area from GTOPO30 world elevation data, the natural sky brightness in the chosen sky direction, based on Garstang modelling, the eye capability with naked eye or a telescope, based on the Schaefer (1990) and Garstang (2000b) approach, and the stellar extinction in the visual photometric band. For near zenith sky directions we also take into account screening by terrain elevation. Maps of naked eye star visibility and telescopic limiting magnitudes are useful to quantify the capability of the population to perceive our Universe, to evaluate the future evolution, to make cross correlations with statistical parameters and to recognize areas where astronomical observations or popularisation can still acceptably be made. We present, as an application, maps of naked eye star visibility and total sky brightness in V band in Europe at the zenith with a resolution of approximately 1 km.

Now, that is not to say their method is totally accurate, they even point out possible sources of inaccuracies themselves (e.g. zenith vs. horizon). But even if there is place for valid critisism your first assessment does not do justice to their methods at all. The maps are far from 'sham'.",0,1380203521,null,0,false,0,ccfr81g,t3_1n4hh3,t1_ccfr81g,t1_ccfqhsz,null,1429336990,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

They are still receiving money due to agricultural funds, whose utility and necessity is debatable. That does not mean our countries are sinks of money, since agriculture is a minuscule part of Italy or Spain's GDPs. The EU has decided that having food independence is important and decided to subsidize those guys.

Am I supposed to believe *ALL* EU citizens are highly educated and cultured? Oh and I saw a group of Italian tourists who were rude and loud and littered everywhere, where can I claim my PhD in Italian History?

Those immigrants all over Europe were uneducated, unemployed poor Turkish people who couldn't find jobs here. My grandparents an my uncles are immigrants in Germany, so I know many people in that situation. Then they spent the next half-century in the countries they went to, in almost total isolation (they didn't know the language, the culture etc.). They basically kept living how they used to live in their little villages they left. Turkey, in the meanwhile, progressed, changed for the better. Now those immigrants are outcast and ridiculed both in Turkey and wherever they immigrated to. That's the situation, they do not represent all Turkish people. 

How do you have the audacity to tell me what I am genetically more akin to? My ancestors just so happen to be from the Caucasus region originally. You know the one where the term ""caucasian"" originated from. I'm not saying all Turks are white, I'm saying it's much more mixed than you think. Darker ones are usually people with Kurdish or Arabic origins, and yes, most people are as white as any Mediterranean person.

Why do you think Turks can't be atheists, by the way? Is it a privilege only Europeans can have? I don't believe in god. My parents are Muslim but they are okay with me being an atheist. Most of the people I know my age or younger don't believe in god either. And you guys have to understand that Islam in Turkey is VERY, and I can't stress this enough, VERY different than in the Middle East. It's a relatively chill, pick-your-favourite-rules-and-ignore-the-rest kinda religion. That's why drinking alcohol is no big deal but when you wanna eat pork it's a big no-no, for instance.

The way I see it, most Europeans have negative thoughts about Turks because of what the Ottomans did. I can't argue that they didn't do anything horrible, but keep in mind nothing that horrible is ever one-sided. If brutal raping and enslaving would make you non-European, then all the greatest nations in Europe are not European either. You don't get to become a world power without violence. 

I know all of you want to confirm your prejudices and your racist views by picking out a few bad examples and generalize it to a whole country but it's just not right.

And I don't say all EU citizens are cultured but I've never seen such barbaric behavior from anyone European. It's not secret that all tourists tend to at bad when they leave their countries. Especially young people. But we're not talking about young tourists though. We are talking about millions of people, who work and live in Europe and make that trip yearly.

Hahahahahahahaha, no. Just no. Turks are not as white as other Mediterraneans. Maybe as white as some Mediterraneans(Lybians, Algerians, Egyptians). Sorry. I'm not insulting you. You're just not white guys. Sorry. Even Greeks and Spanish are lighter than you. Turks are naturally dark. Any non-dark Turk is the result of a Slavic woman from the Balkans being enslaved and raped by a Turk or a little Slavic boy from the Balkans who was taken away from his family and forced to become a Turkish soldier.

Well it's no privilege. I didn't say that. I'm just saying that to be European you're either Christian or atheist. To be Turkish you're either Muslim or atheist. Besides it's no secret that Turks(and other people with Middle Eastern origin) are much more religious than Europeans. And I don't care which rules you follow. I have no idea why pork would be a no-no. It's like cows or chickens. I never said it's the same as in the Middle East. But it's not the same as in Europe either.

You see I have a problem with this. I don't have a negative attitude on Turkey. I have nothing against it and I'm just quoting facts. I'm just saying Turkey isn't European. Just like Japan isn't European. Doesn't mean I don't like Japan.

What saying you're not white is racist? It's not. It can't be. It's not an offense. It's a fact. It's not a bad thing. It's just how things are. Have you seen me offended when someone said I'm not black? I'm just not. As Turks are simply not white. It's not racism. You're just not European.

6 hours is a bit too little.

If I were to go to Sweden, I would first have to go to either Grenaa, Frederikshavn or Hirtshals, which would take anywhere between an hour and 2 and a half hour. Then there's the boat ride, which can be as low as 2 hours(the fast ferry between Frederikshavn-Göteborg) and 12 hours (Frederikshavn-Oslo), but generally the trip takes between 3 and 4 hours. 

From there on, you have to get to the mountains. Göteborg is the place you can reach quickest, but also the place furthest away from the mountains we want. In order to at least reach Sälen, you can add another 6 hours of driving through Västra Götaland and Värmland. 

That's 10-13 hours with rests and pauses.

I don't mind going to either Norway or Sweden(Or the Alps), but having mountains of our own would just make things so much easier.

&gt;Genau das ist ein Strohmann Argument.

Nö. Ein Strohmann wäre es wenn ich behauptet hätte, dass meine Gegner denken würde es sei ok Menschen zu töten um sie zu essen. Dies ist nicht der Fall. Ich habe etwas absurdes aus den Prämissen meines Gegners abgeleitet. Dies ist ein Widerspruchsbeweis.

Well, yes, of course, I agree with you there. Either follow the rules, or try to change them, through the proper channels, whatever they are. However, that is not what has happened in the EU and that is harming the whole union. I mean, it is not like Belgium said, ""Hmm, 60% debt/GDP, that is to low, let us change that"", they just joined and no one gave a shit. No observing or no trying to change it. Now it is just a ""free for all"". And that annoys the hell out of me, in particular since I know that it is harming the EU.

I do, but that's not enough reason for me making them to. 

I am certain they would prefer to work reasonable hours. I've seen the zombie shift workers in countries where this is a thing, and lately, that staff more and more looks undead throughout the day. There are very few people who I'd want to punish with such a schedule, and I wouldn't want to buy my groceries from them. 

Economically: do you think if opening time is e.g. doubled from 12 to 24h, revenue or profits will increase with the additional labor cost? if not, what does that mean for prices, wages and employees?

If the alternatives are no job and a job with inconvenient hours, I would personally prefer the latter.

An argument against legalizing 24/7 shop opening hours, that I would admit is the fact that people wouldn't actually start buying all that much more. Impulse shopping for luxuries would be up, but things like groceries would remain as it is. So depending on they type of shop they would have only little more revenue. Since much of retail already works on thin margins, they would likely have to raise prices to pay all these extra workers. Large franchise chains would have an easier time dealing with 24/7 opening hours than small mom and pop shops.

Still overall I think I would prefer a system where shops are actually open while I am not at work.

true,d4lm3t,ASTR,Austria,"Ok, we’ve got elections coming up on Sunday so I’ll quickly explain the situation and reasoning behind it. Not that I share these views, mind you.

We’ve got five parties in parliament right now. None of them has more than 30 %. There are three between 20 and 30 %: social democrats (SPÖ), christian democrats (ÖVP) and the infamous right-wing freedom party (FPÖ). Then there are the greens and the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ, an FPÖ spin-off but less xenophobic and racist). In theory, there is a right-wing majority but the last coalition government of ÖVP, FPÖ and later on BZÖ didn’t turn out too great causing the SPÖ form a coalition with the ÖVP since then. The only alternative would be to form a coalition with the FPÖ that got even more racist and disgusting since Haider’s days. So the SPÖ say, no way we form a coalition with them despite the fact that the FPÖ has a very pro working class rhetoric going on behind all the racism.

Therefore, the ÖVP has two potential partners whereas the SPÖ only has one. The SPÖ usually ends up with the relative majorority and there’s a tradition that this party starts coalition talks with the others. But there is only the ÖVP to talk to which leads to a grand coalition almost automatically and people are fed up by this kind of government, as there are many foul compromises to be made between conservatives and social democrats. 

So, naturally, some think that a first-past-the-post system could stop this deadlock and pave the way for an absolute majority of one of the larger two parties.

I mentioned the upcoming elections on Sunday. We have a record number of parties running this time, up to seven could end up with seats in parliament. This is what the press sometimes refers to with „italienische Verhältnisse“ (italian cirumstances) implying chaos, endless arguments and frequent re-elections. This is an argument against the current system as well.

It's not like the negotiating parties just hand them the entire treaty as has been currently negotiated and say 'do what you want'. Instead, they're asked for their opinion on a clause (how much would this affect your business, or something like that) and then the EU politicians decide if thats what they want. 

Seriously, people see lobbying as some kind of sinister 'money-under-the-table' deal, but its mostly just trying to get a feel for how the treaty would actually affect the economy. The lobbyists give good reasons, and its up to the politicians to figure out whether its worth whatever ancillary costs that might impose on the rest of the population. 

They can't campaign against the treaty as they don't know everything it contains, or whether the negotiators accepted their positions. The populace, if given full access to the negotiations (as opposed to the citizen inputs we have now, which function in a fundamentally similar fashion to the corporations) would simply hamper the process too much.

It's so easy to see the corporations as evil, influence imposing, bandits.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; I have already answered you,

No you have not. You have not said, at all who is responsible for the state of southern Europe. I know you said that the southern Europeans were *not* responsible for their democratically elected government (a statement I find moronic btw) but then who is? Who elected the governments then, if not the southern Europeans? Who is responsible for the corruption in southern Europe if not the southern Europeans. You are not answering that, and I guess it is because you are a coward. 

&gt; Your question itself is loaded.

No, it isn't- only if you are someone who is afraid of the answer. For normal, non cowards it is a normal question, we ask it all the time. ""Who is responsible for the outfishings of the oceans""? ""Who is responsible for the crappy housing situation in Stockholm?"". That is what adults and responsible people do, one a) ask what is wrong b) then who is responsible. That is part of the process of fixing things. The very fact that you do not even *want* to talk about responsibility and is avoiding it like the plague tells me that you are not a responsible adult who is interested in fixing things. You just want to make sure, at all costs, that southern Europe is not made responsible for the mess in southern Europe....

&gt;1. Southern Europe has wasted EU funds. 2. Southern Europe is corrupt beyond solution and we all must be blame its people for it. 3. Southern Europe should become more productive (cool let's move all beach resorts to Rheinland and its industry to Mallorca)

Are those things wrong then? What is wrong with southern Europe becoming more productive and less corrupt? Btw, it is you who added beoyond salvation and ,moving to the Rhineland, but that is just your idiotic assumptions and made up stories again. It is odd, it is you that accuse me of lies, yet you are the irresponsible person who makes stuff up. 




&gt;I have debated all those points, but you keep asking the same questions over and over, showing that you just don't give a fuck about any fact it's presented to you.


Facts? I know about the funds, but you have not given me any facts about corruption and how to fix it. You just called me a liar, when I proved you wrong, you changed the subject. Fact is that southern Europe is corrupt , pay far less in taxes, are not a net contributor and far less productive. That is nothing to debate about that, and at least you are intelligent enough to change the subject when I prove you wrong, again and again. I think southern Europe should stop being corrupt, and become productive, pay taxes and become a net contributor. But, to do that one has to be responsible. You have proven, over and over again, that it will take a long time. Grow the fuck up and realise that no one but you put yourself in the spot where you are. You caused it, now fix it, with your own money.

&gt; Die Pflicht zum Besuch des Schulunterrichts ist das Instrument zur Verwirklichung dieser staatlichen Erziehungsziele. Für die Schul(besuchs)pflicht im Allgemeinen hat das BVerfG dabei die Bedeutung namentlich des verfassungsrechtlichen Erziehungsziels der Integration unterschiedlicher Kulturen hervorgehoben, dessen Verwirklichung die Einübung und Praktizierung beiderseitiger Toleranz in der Schule voraussetzt (vgl. BVerfG [2. Kammer des Ersten Senats], BVerfGK 8, 151 = BeckRS 2009, 38783). Für die Pflicht zur Teilnahme am koedukativen Schwimmunterricht gilt hinsichtlich der Relevanz für die vorbezeichneten staatlichen Erziehungsziele nichts Anderes. Der Sport- und Schwimmunterricht ist neben der Vermittlung von bewegungsbezogenen Kompetenzen auf die allgemeinen Erziehungsziele ausgerichtet. Die die verfassungsrechtlichen Vorgaben einfachgesetzlich ausgestaltenden §§ 2 und 3 HessSchulGbeanspruchen Geltung auch für den Sport- und Schwimmunterricht. Insbesondere soll auch dieser Unterricht die Schülerinnen und Schüler befähigen, die Grundrechte für sich und andere wirksam werden zu lassen, eigene Rechte zu wahren und die Rechte anderer auch gegen sich selbst gelten zu lassen (§ 2 II Nr. 1 HessSchulG), die Beziehungen zu anderen Menschen nach den Grundsätzen der Achtung und Toleranz, der Gerechtigkeit und der Solidarität zu gestalten (§ 2 Nr. 4 HessSchulG) sowie Menschen anderer Herkunft, Religion und Weltanschauung vorurteilsfrei zu begegnen und somit zum friedlichen Zusammenleben verschiedener Kulturen beizutragen sowie für die Gleichheit und das Lebensrecht aller Menschen einzutreten (§ 2 II Nr. 7 HessSchulG). Darüber hinaus sollen Schülerinnen und Schüler auch im Sport- und Schwimmunterricht lernen, eine gleichberechtigte Beziehung zwischen den Geschlechtern zu entwickeln (§ 2 III 2 Nr. 2 HessSchulG) und Konflikte vernünftig und friedlich zu lösen, aber auch Konflikte zu ertragen (§ 2 III 2 Nr. 3 HessSchulG). Nach § 3 HessSchulG, der Grundsätze für die Verwirklichung des in § 2 HessSchulGeinfachgesetzlich geregelten Bildungs- und Erziehungsauftrags der Schule beinhaltet, soll die Schule Voraussetzungen zur Förderung der Gleichberechtigung von Jungen und Mädchen schaffen (§ 3 IV 1 HessSchulG). Schülerinnen und Schüler werden grundsätzlich gemeinsam unterrichtet (§ 3 IV 2 HessSchulG). Sofern es pädagogisch sinnvoll ist, können sie zeitweise auch getrennt unterrichtet werden (§ 3 IV 3 HessSchulG).

Beim Schwimmen haben wir Jungs liebend gerne gerauft und die Mädels wollten eigentlich gar nicht ins Wasser (wie gesagt, nicht aus religiösen Gründen). Weiter gibt es auch Untersuchungen, die zeigen, dass Mädels im Mathematik-Unterricht bessere Leistungen bringen, wenn sie nicht koedukativ unterrichtet werden. Man mag draus machen, was man will.

The insane widespread bribery in the US industry and patent system; and their utter lack of enforcment of refusal due to prior act; or even the very fact they don't read any patent before signing it in the US (seriously how the fuck can somebody patent clicking on an hyperlink on internet ?); or the fact they tend to apply it only when it suits em (*cough* apple vs samsung *cough* where the US judge never bothered to aknowledge any Samsung patent before blasting them by enforcing US patents like patents on ""tapping a touch screen"" ) because it gives more money to the US is also highly responsible of their own current system.

&gt; A host of companies also had to fend off a suit in East Texas filed by a company that claimed to have invented the “interactive Web.” 

Seriously those kind of people only deserve a patent clerk's boot to the arse.

tl;dr : Europe's gov is not as bribed as the US' one. Oh, sorry, i forgot, nowadays it's called ""generous disinterested donations"" and ""campaign donations to friendly politicians"". As long as we keep the corrupt US patent system away we'll keep running.

What the US would need to do would be :

- Enforce real search of prior art. People should not possibly be able to patent the computer mouse in 2013. It's a farce.

- Enforce complete reinspection of all patents owned by a company or corp suspected of corruption, bribery, conflicts of interest, falsely filing patent to claim idea or destroy the market throught unfair monopoly practices

- Re read every single current patent and destroy the corrupt placeholders (borderline fake or illegal patents) used like lawyer minigun ammunition by every single large corps around. It's totally insane.

- Tax patents. Make a tax for each owned patents. Maybe it'll force them to go to the essential and stop ""chain producing"" those as legal ammunition, once again.

- Prevent patenting common ideas or ideas invented by the concurrent (right now in reality it's to the first who patent things and not the one who invent things). There's a serious need for a reality check in the US.

- Company found to be willfully submitting bogus patents should be banned from deposing new patents for a length of time; like 5 years. It would stop them once again and make them think twice and look first.

- Rebuild totally from scratch the US justice system. Basically a single individual can't sue anyone without risking is life in lawyer costs. Let alone defend himself against anything. It's therefore commonly used as blackmail by the patent owners mafia (oh sorry, called ""intellectual property companies"") or big companies; and i'm pretty sure threats and blackmail are extremely illegal somewhere in the US legal code. 

- Legal costs should be regulated by laws or the court should send you a ""free"" lawyer (paid by the state or fed gov) should you need any legal recourses and cant afford one.

True, there isn't much of a binge drinking culture. That seems to be a predominantly anglophone thing, for some reason.

Again assumptions. At least you have now admitted to the fact that you are refusing to answer my question! So, you are accusing me of lying despite having no proof, you make assumptions you have no proof for, and you refuse to answer questions. That sort of makes you a person who can't discuss, and btw, a coward for not answering. 


&gt;Southern Europe problems are to be dealt by Southern Europeans not but some Swed bigot full of himself. We know the shit in our countries pretty fucking well.

Proof for bigot? Again, you are so pathethic, you have no answers, and then you accuse *me*. I am not the one not answerings questions and lying, you are. 

&gt;EU industry has been promoted in certain areas and dismantled in others.

I very much doubt you can categorize something as EU industry yet. It is much more constructive to talk about Germany's industry, Finlands industry etc. We are not that integrated you know. 

&gt; Other sectors like tourism or agriculture have been developed in other areas.


What do you mean? Southern Europe has not  adjusted properly, *that* is why they should have developed in other areas, or, again, southern Europe has refused to see the writing on the wall. For example, he CAP is rather idiotic, and what it has done, is to sustain non profitable agriculture. The CAP is still doing it btw, but to a lesser degree. Countries like Denmark, Sweden and Finland has adjusted to the harsh realities of modern agriculture since, well, since the 60's. The fact that southern Europe (and France) has sustained their agriculture who is very old fashioned and now is complaining, lies on the doors of those countries, and is a failure to see what has been going on since forever. I hate the CAP btw. Not completely against all forms of agricultural support, but the CAP is idiotic, and take up far to much of the EU budget.

And for example tourism has not been hit that hard in other countries, it has been hit hard in Greece, the Euro makes it more expensive than for example Croatia and Turkey. Again, not news, just failure to see the writing on the wall. Not exclusive to southern Europe though, by all means. But still, it was and is well known that the Euro is very imperfect currency area and that the Euro would be to expensive for the Greeks. I very much remember the arguments around our Euro vote, and one of the main argument against the Euro was that it would never be adjusted to our economy. Obviously that argument holds for everyone really (apart from Germany). But, the reason we said no were more suspiscion against rest of Europe, not any intelligence around economics btw. So, that the Euro would be to expensive was well known. 



&gt;A lower productivity is not necessarily wrong, it's the sign of certain types of economic activity. 

Yes, but Greece has lower productivity on stuff they make too. 

And, for anyone that has studied economics, it is not smart to build a whole economy on tourism and services. While one can enjoy it while it lasts, it is not a sure thing (nothing is really).Look at Thailand, they are trying like hell to diversify. That is why I ask what Greece for example have been doing for the last 30-40 years. Anyone with an economic background can tell you it is good to diversify a tad,and not put all your eggs in one basket, in particular if that basket is agriculture and tourism. Look at Estonia, and Poland. They are trying to build up industries. Why haven't we seen more of that in the last 30 years in southern Europe?  That is one of the big question that I have been asking, and I would very much to know who is responsible for that. Had southern Europe bothered to do that,they would not be in the situation that they are in. 

Greece has been in the EU since 81, and I do not think they are on their way to become net contributors. I think the Estonia will be net contributors in 20 years, maybe Poland too. That is because they have dealt with their situation completely different. However, you do not want to see that. You are refusing to accept responsibility. You do not even think that people in a democracy are responsible for their own elected government. 

The problem is, until you guys actually accept your part of  responsibility for the situation southern Europe is in, it will never change. Change is not nice, but it is necessary for everyone. And that involves accepting ones part. However, looking at the way you are arguing you are just refusing to accept any of it. You are not even admitting that the Italians are responsible for Berlusconi. Since people like you seem to be far to many, I fear for the future of southern Europe. I can't change you, but I can influence how my country acts. And my advice is - stay away until they actually prove that they are attempting to change. Fight integration, because that would mean integrating with people like you, who refuse change, refuse to accept responsibility.

true,baycitytroller,SCOT,Scotland,"There are many reasons why it would be desirable, some more important than others and each person will have their own various reasons. Here are a few - in no particular order.

* Getting rid of the nukes - forget for the moment that they are an abomination and are illegal, currently the UK's nuclear arsenal is located 25 miles from George Square in the heart of Glasgow (Scotland's most populous area). Can you imagine the French locating their arsenal 25 miles from the Arc de Triomphe or the Americans locating theirs 25 miles from Times Square? Or what about 25 miles from Trafalgar Square? We want rid of them.

* Mismanagement of resources - few nations are lucky enough to be blessed with a windfall such as North Sea oil and gas. Norway - a country similar in size and population - had the same luck at the same time and has built up a sovereign wealth fund of US$737Billion. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_sovereign_wealth_funds) is a list of various wealth funds from around the world. Many governments from countries less wealthy than the UK and therefore with more pressing need to spend revenues derived from their natural resources now, rather than the future, have seen the sense of setting aside some of their revenues for future generations. The UK is absent from that list because Westminster has pissed North Sea oil and gas revenues against the wall. The North Sea will continue to produce for about another 40 years and although the volumes will be lower there is as much value to be taken out as has already been extracted.

* Getting a government we actually voted for.

* It is the only way to protect the gains of devolution. Only 6% of those living in Scotland would like to see devolution repealed. Most  (67%) would like to see it extended further or to have full independence ([Link](http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/1021487/ssa12tables.pdf) - table 4). Many believe that if we vote ""No"" we will see Holyrood emasculated.

* Having control over taxation is the only way to make the powers already devolved work properly. Although the Scottish Parliament has control over education and health (amongst others) the money available is determined by spending decisions made in Westminster for England. So, although the Scottish Parliament is in favour of free university education, when Westminster decided to cut its funding for student tuition fees to zero the amount of money in the block grant relating to student tuition fees was also reduced to zero (block grant - all our tax revenues go down to London and then we are given pocket money back). We have been told that there will be [no further devolution of taxation powers](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/no-further-tax-powers-for-scotland-says-david-cameron-1-2084365) - so independence is the only way forward.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;If wolves/bears where to be introduced I think doing it away from the mainland would be the best bet, that way the population has a cap, both wolves and humans are safely separated (we don't want either being killed), 

Wolves do not kill humans really, unless you insist giving them a newborn. Sweden has had two deaths in 200 years from wolves, both tame wolves that went berserk, in cages btw. We do not even have wolf attacks. I have never ever heard of one on a human. 

Bears - the only death I have heard about is a hunter who a) had a dog who woke the bear up midwinter and annoyed it b) the bear was hungry and confused and went for the dog c) the hunter tried to protect the dog and shot the bear d) the wounded bear went for the hunter. If you can avoid doing that, you are safe. In fact, we have something like 2500 bears in Sweden, and really no attacks. At a research facility in Sweden they made of study of seeing how easy it was to get close to a bear. They walked towards bears who wore a GPS collar. 1000 times they have walked towards bears, behaving like normal people in the forest, talking, perhaps being quiet and picking berries etc. They hardly ever even got close. A very few times they could spot the animal, and this was when they knew where the animal were. They were never attacked. 

So, do not fear being attacked by bears or wolves, they should fear us much more. ",0,1380221385,null,0,false,0,ccfxc3s,t3_1n5ru3,t1_ccfxc3s,t1_ccfqbyd,null,1429334066,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

That's quite an indirect consequence, but, given the globalised nature of our day and age, a very important and damning one. 

Another hugely important consequence along those same threads would be, in my opinion, the current cultural fragmentation of the country. Spain has always had vibrant different cultures (Catalans, Basques, Galicians, etc), but following the nationalist victory, Franco's Spain imposed an incredibly harsh cultural homogenisation, in which Castilian culture (blended with some facets of Anadalusian traditions, such as bull-fighting and flamenco) was brutishly imposed upon all the provinces as a socially-engineered ""Spanish"" identity (which was more an oppressive construction than anything previously native throughout the peninsula). My conjecture would be that decades of such particularly harsh and artificial imposition of a misrepresentative and somewhat foreign identity on the provinces from Madrid's bureaucracy had the long-term effect of fanning the flames of cultural separatism. People couldn't speak their dialects, couldn't use certain names for their children, and were generally severely mistreated. Following the transition to democracy, it's honestly no wonder there are so many political factions wanting greater autonomy, cultural independence, and even secession. 

As for other impacts, honestly, it seems to have really been glossed over. It's definitely not something deeply embedded in the national consciousness, like say Vietnam in the states or the Great Patriotic War (WWII) in Russia. That doesn't mean to say people aren't aware of the absolute great atrocities that occurred during the war; the common graves and deaths of famous individuals (such as Lorca and Unamuno) are well-known public testaments to them. People *know* these things happened. It's simply not discussed or debated, though, probably out of fears of more division and polarisation on such incredibly sensitive topics. Outside of young activists who are pro-republic/anti-monarchy, these issues simply go ignored.

Zu der Sache mit den Werten: Dein Argument ist Scheiße. Natürlich und völlig ohne Frage sind ""westliche"" Werte besser. Hier werden Homosexuelle nicht auf dem Marktplatz aufgehängt oder gefoltert. Hier wird auch keinem Dieb die Hand abgehackt. Es läuft vielleicht nicht alles rund, aber es hat sich mittlerweile rumgesprochen, dass so ein Scheiß nicht mehr geht. Und wo sind unsere Werte bitte christlich geprägt? Sie wurden im Gegenteil im Zuge der Aufklärung gegen die Kirche erstritten. So eine Art Reformation bzw.

I've always been quite the stickler for justice, facts and history. Any of those issues will upset me. 

&gt; As far as I know you are neither Jewish nor Lithuanian.

I do not have to be Lithuanian, a Lithuanian Jew or another type of Jew to feel sorry for Lithuanians, Lithuanian Jewish or other Jewish victims of oppressions and murder. The emphasis on the importance of nationality or identity over justice is part of what troubles me with the situations in the Batlcis today. 

➢	But didn't it ever occur to you that maybe there is a reason for it? 

It did. I don't care. Murder is murder. War crimes are war crimes. Genocide is genocide. There are some acts that cannot be explained away. 
I do not believe in collective or national guilt. People alive are not guilty for what their ancestors did. The times were pretty bad and there were a lot of people with very warped understanding of how the world worked. But if people now, who have the luxury of historical perspective, who have a relatively comfortable life and a modern understanding, seek to excuse or mitigate these crimes, then they are falling victim to a weaker form of the same warping. 

&gt;&gt;PPS Why did you start this conversation with ""What victims did you have in mind?""
&gt;&gt;I was not sure what did you have in mind.

Why not? Did you not know who died during the German times? Or was the confusion over if there were a particular group I cared more about? Or that people in Lithuania were more touchy about? If it’s the last, then I can answer now that the reaction was similar to yours now  -a general lack of interested/concern/sympathy/mourning/whatevery-you-want-to-call-it over people killed during the German time and efforts to somehow explain it away, mitigate it, or show how other victims, those under the Soviets were somehow more important. To my outside eyes, this seems a little like being OK with genocide and is really creepy. I took a bus tour in Vilnius and overheard other tourists expressing similar opinions.

&gt; &gt;I've also heard the ""Jews were Communists"" argument. A disproportionate amount of Jews were Communist, and not only in Lithuania.
&gt;It is not the argument that they were communists. The argument is that some of them were responsible for the suffering of many Latvians and Lithuanians. That's the point.


So the holocaust and targeting of all Jews in Lithuania, that causes the death of 95% of all Jews there, 200 000 people, the greatest loss of life in Lithuania’s history, they were all asking for it because they were some “bad Jews?” Or, barring that they were all asking for it, the ones that weren’t don’t deserve to be remembered or mourned? What about collaborating ethnic Lithuanians? They worked with the Nazis. Others worked with the Soviets. By the same logic I should show some understanding for people who killed any Lithuanians, or at least not include them in any memorial or historical efforts. 

&gt; If Austria could do it, Lithuania should do it.
I am not sure what you have in mind. Austria could do it. To make amends for what happened? Neither Russians nor Jews made any excuses for what they did to Lithuanians. If that was your suggestions then it could actually sound a little upsetting to somebody.

If you want to have a conversation about why the Russians need to acknowledge their historical crimes, then I would agree with you. I have had that discussion with Russians. The common understanding of the history there is very flawed – many believe that the Russian soldiers were mostly heroes, and that accusations against them are propaganda from the West to diminish their contributions in ending WWII. I can understand how hearing that line could be upsetting – it was upsetting to me to hear that my dear Oma maybe made up being raped, or that she was exaggerating the number of women and girls raped in our town.

If you want to have a conversation about why the surviving 5% of Jews owe Lithuanians an apology, then that it too crazy for me, and too sad. Lithuania owes them an apology, same as Austria did.  Lithuania also owes them, and every other victim of the time, from all sides, the historical consideration to appreciate what their losses meant. If Lithuania wishes to engage in memorials, then they need to make room for all victims, and learn from the situation as a thing to be avoided, not celebrated in part. Austria did that too, and society is much the better for it. That’s what I meant. 

In a way, I actually prefer having that conversation with Russians to the one I just had with you, even if it is more personal, and therefore upsetting. The Russians swear that their soldiers were all angels. They deny the bad things that the soldiers did, not that those things are bad. Your conversation seems to try and excuse some of the terrible things that you do admit happened. This is just as upsetting from a historical and truth oriented side, but even more so from a modern personality and culture assessing side.

TL;DR This exchange makes me sad and confirmed my previous stereotype about Lithuania being defensive about its history. It also confirmed a stereotype about Lithuania that I heard from Russians and took to be a biased interpretation – that Lithuanians aren’t defensive about their history and focused on their victim times, rather they aren’t sorry about the bad parts, that they were and are more than a bit anti-Semitic, that they viewed Jews as collectively guilty for some being pro-Communist and as an “anti-Lithuanian other” who deserved to die.  Therefore they, and any other victims of the German and Lithuanian leadership during the time that they were together, aren’t actually deserving of memorials, and that is why they aren’t memorialized.  Sad and infuriating at the same time. ",0,1380223028,null,0,1381723655,0,ccfxy2s,t3_1kxpzp,t1_ccfxy2s,t1_ccfjkq1,null,1429333781,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,baycitytroller,SCOT,Scotland,"There are different strands of thinking within the independence movement regarding EU membership. I think most favour continued membership but some do advocate joining EFTA instead. Opinion polls currently show that, as opposed to the rest of the UK, the majority favour continued membership. One of the dangers of a ""No"" vote is that the proposed UK in/out referendum would result in Scotland being dragged out of the EU against the wishes of the majority of those living in Scotland - another argument in favour of independence.

The position of the SNP, who currently form the government in Holyrood, is that Scotland would negotiate its membership in the period between the referendum (18/9/14) and when we finally split from the UK (which would be some time in 2016 if all goes to plan). So this would be done from within the EU while we are still members - a process dubbed INlargement rather than ENlargement.

The beauty of independence is that the people of Scotland will be able to decide for themselves - much like people living in Poland can - it is the normal state of affairs for most nations.

Here are a couple of articles by a former BBC Radio broadcaster Derek Bateman about what it would be like the day after the referendum - [Yes](http://drderekbateman.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/dateline-september-19-2014-2/) written as he sees it - [No](http://drderekbateman.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/dateline-september-19-2014/) - written in the style/parody of Simon Heffer a particularly splenetic Unionist who writes for the Daily Mail; a particularly nasty paper often joking refered to as the Daily Fail or the [Daily Heil](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Daily_Mail).

&gt; UNITED NATIONS—Despite the economic crisis that has hit budgets across Europe, the European Union has proved it won't shirk from its international duties, one of its top leaders told the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; In his speech, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy focused mainly on the crisis in Syria, appealing for a rapid political solution and offering Europe's help in advancing talks.
&gt; 
&gt; But Mr. Van Rompuy's other message was that Europe remains a serious player on the international stage—from significant aid donations to the peace and security missions it runs in various parts of the world.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Despite the financial crisis that put our economies to the test, we don't disengage from our responsibilities in the world,"" Mr. Van Rompuy said.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We are meeting our political and financial commitments for development and humanitarian action from the common European budget, even at a time that we are cutting the budget,"" he added. ""During the last two years the European Union has launched no less than five new EU civil or military missions: to support the reconstruction of Mali and South Sudan, to reestablish security in the Sahel and on Libyan borders, as well as across Somalia.""
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Van Rompuy said Europe had now also proved that it will never let the euro zone, or the EU itself, break up. This time last year, Europe was still in the midst of a deep financial crisis with many expecting that Greece—and possibly other countries—could be pushed out of the single currency and the bloc as well.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Our political will to preserve Europe's unity cannot be underestimated,"" he said. ""We have shown it these past five years. For ultimately, it is a political project that unites us—to bring together countries, to bring together people.""
&gt; 
&gt; Underscoring the upbeat domestic message EU leaders were determined to take to this week's UN meetings, Mr. Van Rompuy said the results of economic overhauls ""are starting to work.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""The existential threat to the euro area is over and we are now fully focusing on improving prospects for employment and growth,"" he said.
&gt; 
&gt; However on Syria, Mr. Van Rompuy's message was devoid of cheer.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Syria, as a country, as a nation, is being destroyed beyond recognition. It will take time, courage and perseverance to build an inclusive, united, democratic Syria, where all Syrians can feel they belong and where all share a common future regardless of their identity, regardless of their religion,"" he said, according to a text of his remarks.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The promise of the Arab Spring must be met in Syria too—just as it must in Egypt and beyond. At heart, it is a shared yearning for democracy, for tolerance, for social justice—a powerful message in which we still believe.""",0,1380224677,null,0,false,0,ccfyjvz,t3_1n6htb,t1_ccfyjvz,t1_ccfxkw4,null,1429333499,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Es gibt Staaten die es auf die eine oder andere Weise handhaben - einen wirklichen Sieger kann ich dabei nicht ausmachen. Beide Systeme haben ihre Berechtigung. Übrigens habe ich nur von Schulbildung, und nicht von Schulpflicht geschrieben.

&gt;&gt;Schwimmunterricht

Ich weiß nicht wen du da zitierst, mich jedoch nicht. Aber egal, ich will dennoch darauf eingehen.

 Ob du einen Sinn darin siehst, ist ja für die grundsätzliche Fragestellung, wie weit Religionsfreiheit den Unterricht und die Bildung einer jungen Person beschränken dürfen auch irrelevant. Wieso ""muss der Staat jemanden dazu zwingen Schwimmen zu lernen""? Weil schwimmen zur Allgemeinbildung gehört wie Deutsch, Englisch, Mathematik, Erdkunde und Biologie beispielsweise. Und darüber hinaus sogar lebenswichtig sein kann. Außerdem kommt noch ein sozialer Faktor hinzu. Ein weiterer wichtiger Grund ist außerdem: Weil es so von den Volksvertretern beschlossen wurde.

Recht interessant finde ich, dass du mit der Bildungs- statt Schulpflicht argumentierst. Wenn es in Deutschland eine Bildungspflicht gäbe, und in dieser Brust- und Rückenschwimmen sowie kraulen stünde, was würde sich denn dadurch ändern? Die Kinder müssten es trotzdem lernen, und wenn die Eltern nicht gerade einen Pool im Garten/Haus haben, müsste dafür auf öffentliche Bäder/Seen zurückgegriffen werden. Da würde das Mädchen dann auch Jungs in Badehosen sehen, was die Eltern ja anscheinend verhindern wollen da es gegen ihre Religion verstößt. Und wenn das Kind dann am Ende die prüfung nicht besteht, weil es nicht schwimmen kann - was ist dann gewonnen? Es würde sich nichts Ändern. Da würde es nur helfen, den Lehrplan auszudünnen. Also Schwimmen raus. Die Rettungsschwimmer werden es dir in ca 10-20 Jahren ""danken"". Und wenn wir dabei sind, Mathe raus. Irrationale Zahlen sind gegen meine Religion, die sind quasi Hexerei!

Europe-wide parties should campaign for seats instead of national parties, to avoid the European elections being a tool to simply punish national governments in power. 

As the only directly elected body of the EU, Parliament's powers should be increased at the expense of the powers of the other institutions. This will also help to increse turnout in elections.

The member states which currently do not use the euro (including those with a permanent opt-out) should adopt it as soon as they meet the convergance criteria.

And it is a law in Germany that you only drive on the left lane for overtaking and have to change on the right lane as soon as possible.  And most people do this. in fact I think that german drivers in general are good drivers.

But there are some people who don't give a fuck or are too dumb to drive. Sometimes they drive with only 120-140kph on the left lane and block it for the other cars. Often there are cars driving 250kph or more. And it really sucks to brake for those assholes when there is more than enough space on the right lane.

Once I drove with ca. 245kph, the car behind me was even faster. I wanted to let him pass after the next overtaking. I was on the left lane (there were 3 lanes) and suddenly a car changed the lane directly on front of me. So i (and the car behind me) had to do a full brake to avoid a collision.


Regarding the nazi thing:
Well, most of the nazis look like you and me, only a few dress like the cliche neonazi, but there often are legal protests of the far right npd and other far right groups. 
There are also videos of ""secret"" meetings of the npd, recorded with a hidden camera, where you can the the people making hitler greetings.

Er gab Ihnen den Erlös vom Verkauf des Autos. Das Auto war sehr schön. Es war sauber und sportlich. Es wurde schnell verkauft. Ein netter Mann hat das Auto gekauft. Er hat den Preis hinterfragt, ob er denn richtig war. Ich habe ihm erzählt, dass der Preis richtig sei und er war sehr froh. Er hat für das Auto 250 Mark bezahlt. Sie hätten es nicht machen sollen. Er war mein Mann. Sie haben meine Ehe zerstört. Benutzen Sie die 250 Mark und kaufen sich Moral. Sie sind eine Schlampe.

Things that we aren't even really thinking about, because they're not **really** pressing now, are going to get pressing real soon, in the next twenty years I'd say.

The people who are having the kids now will gain more and more political clout - Muslims and other poor, not-so-well-educated immigrants. If that comes off as racist, I'm sorry, and that is definitely not how I mean it, but, you know, those demographic groups have more kids on average.
Increasing ethnic tension, too.

If China's economy doesn't melt down, their middle class keeps growing, and interior demand goes up - then we might be in a spot of bother.

If Europe's economy keeps stagnating, you can expect more social tensions to bubble over, with the (few) young people frustrated that they have to work so much to support the (many) pensioners.

A comprehensive reworking of the whole pension and welfare system might be in order. Or it might just kinda fall apart.

I have a sneaking suspicion that this is a somewhat natural circle of life for civilisations. Rome was also rich and educated, as was Byzantium and Baghdad before the Mongols sacked it. Their education, culture, and ethnic/religious tolerance didn't do them much good, however, when the young and hungry barbarian hordes came a-knocking.

They were plundered, fell, and then the center of power moved to some other place. Some other culture or ethnic group began to gain power and wealth, and with it time, resources, and opportunities to improve education, health, and so on.

Of course, history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes.

As the horrors of the Second World War fade out of living memory (also in the next 20 years), people might start collectively beating their chests again, hankering for some action that their stagnant economies and social situations can't give them otherwise. On the other hand, it sure would be nice if Steven Pinker's ""Better Angels of Our Nature"" book and theory is right - that violence has lessened over the course of human history and will continue to lessen.

Interesting times a-comin' in any case, though. It might be good to invest in some land tucked away in some high mountains somewhere where there isn't anything terribly important that somebody might want.

I never had a problem to go on a drinking binge when i was in Bremen (you need general understanding where to go, the student quarters are pretty small, still works very well), in Hamburg (well on the Reperbahn everyone is on a drinking binge after 9pm) or in Berlin (really big club scene, if you meet some local people you can hang with, you will get offered drugs *really* fast. Lots of drugs in the club scene. Drinking in the streets isnt that big as it is in Hamburg. You move from pub to bars to clubs.)

If you try to find a prepayed contract check the flyers of supermarkets or discounters. Never walk into a mobile shop. Check the internetpages of discounters like ALDI. They got really good coverage in the cities for 15€ a month, (3€/month smallest inet flatrate).

And the GEZ taxes indeed suck ass, but well, thats how it is. 

And now on a personal note:

And as good as the south might be, the north got the sea. ;)

Let me offer you something:

Next time come visit the north; come to Hamburg and drink your way throught the Reeperbahn on a saturday evening. The Reeperbahn is friendly and dangerous at the same time, with hundreds, maybe thousands of drunken people who are looking for their next drink like camels seek the water. You'll find many great bars, many bad bars!, small restaurants, theatres, and clubs here, along with sex shops, sex museums, erotic theaters, profi and amateur burlesque and strip clubs. You think you know drunk? Wait till you shuffle over the Hans-Alberts-Platz at 4am. 

If you can make it till the crack of dawn grap your friends, grap your drinks and follow the caravan of drunks until you and all the other alcohol zombies get spilled onto the fishmarket at 7am on a sunday morning.

Quickly you will find yourself on hunt to buy cheap shades so that you can bring at least a small barrier between you and all the sober people with their families who are just there to enjoy the flair while they have no idea that you have just survived a suicidal drinking binge that would have made Jack Nicholson proud.

  With some luck the sun will shine in your face while you eat delicious seafood and listen to the resident coverband by some 50 year old men who will change forever your perception of the song Born in the USA.

 And then you will finally find some rest for your feet while you sit at the Altona peer, really close to the water, where you still can hear the band in your back. And then you will just sit there on this glorious morning, completley out of your mind, sipping on your freshly tapped, ice cold beer, watching the tide roll in and the cruise ships crawl by.

@ontopic: my condolences. it is really sad, when a young person with ambition passes away. :/

i work for a tourist agency and i see lots of younger folks still book their flights in persona, not via internet. just as a hint, if you can't find anything on that pc. 

and if the flight has already been paid, maybe the family can look at his mail. or even apply for a check account balance (handout). I don't know the procedures in the states, but family members need to fill in some paper work and generally have to have official papers like a death certificate to apply for a look at the check account of the deceased. maybe this could help, but this can also be a real nerve wrecking for family members.

&gt; In the eve of the Revolutions of 1989, the palais became the resort of numerous East German refugees who had reached Prague, climbed over the fence and camped out in the grounds. While there were small groups hiding there occasionally since the embassy was opened in 1974, the number rose to several thousands in September, causing serious problems of supply and hygiene.
Behind the scenes the West German government negotiated with East German authorities and the Soviet Union how to solve these worsening conditions. When Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in the evening of 30 September stepped on the balcony to announce an agreement on the refugees' voyage to West Germany, the crowd cheered on the keyword Ausreise (departure). This event marked an emotional and significant moment in German history.

/edit: Keep in mind that those people who reached the grounds of the embassy had lost everything from their old live in the DDR by entering the embassy. They knew that and took the risk anyway. And they were trapped there because Soviet Russia wasnt allowing them to move through the Czech Republic.

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","Yep. In Germany, there are 3 secondary school degrees. Only one requires you to take a second foreign language (So I didn't have to take it). I remember that one year, we had a course after school where you could take Dutch but that was only offered for one year. I think if I had the option to take Polish or something, I might have done that. Even the cold North would have been more interesting to me than the Romance languages (though I'm learning French right now because the interest came when I was 19 or something like that).

I think it's still pretty much French or Latin here. But I don't think there is need for French or Latin anywhere. Even if you want to go for historical linguistics in uni, you can still benefit from speaking a third modern language and every Frenchmen that works in an international company will probably speak English. So why not go for stuff that interests people like Old Norse, Ancient Greek for old languages or Danish, Polish, Russian for modern languages as an option (sure, French and Latin should be on that list as well but it shouldn't be the only languages available everywhere).

A school in my city actually offers Japanese because a lot of big Japanese companies have their Europe or Germany HQ in my city (Düsseldorf). 

Schools always go for languages with which you can make money so basically, surrounding big countries. French, German, Russian (and English, obviously) though I guess Russian is declining. But why wouldn't you be able to make good use of your Dutch or Danish skills? They started offering Spanish even though the Spanish economy is going down like a hooker and most other Spanish countries are economically not really competitive with EU countries. And Norway might not be big but they earn something like 25-30€ on average per hour so why shouldn't I be able to make good use of Norwegian?

Jobs are also not a problem. Think about the linguistics major that can't find a job. Would you rather teach other linguistics students just so they will try to steal your job at some point or people that might actually be interested?

And, of course, culture can be interesting as well and you learn much more about culture through language than through any other method except visiting constantly.

Posso capire perfettamente il tuo sfogo e le situazioni spiacevoli che questa professione si porta dietro: straordinari non pagati, responsabilità eccessive rispetto allo stipendio percepito, incapacità di far comprendere al personale non-tecnico la complessità del proprio ruolo, vita personale ridotta e così via.

Per quel poco che ho imparato ti suggerisco di approcciare la situazione in questa maniera:

1. Ho la possibilità di chiedere di più al mio attuale datore di lavoro? L'azienda ha la possibilità economica di valorizzare maggiormente il mio lavoro? Vi sono quindi soldi per potermi aumentare lo stipendio o pagare qualcuno che mi aiuti? Ho abbastanza esperienza per chiedere di essere valorizzato maggiormente?
2. Se le domande poste al punto 1 hanno una risposta positiva allora: Chiedi. E' difficile che il tuo datore di lavoro decida in autonomia di premiarti a meno che non abbia un'interesse specifico nel farlo. Se le domande poste al punto 1 hanno una risposta negativa passa al punto 3.
3. Se il tuo lavoro ti opprime ma ti permette di andare su Reddit allora hai anche tempo per:
    - aggiornare il tuo Curriculum Vitae;
    - aggiornare il tuo profilo su Linked.in;
    - cercare un altro lavoro su Monster, Infojobs o quel che ti pare.
E' tempo di crisi ma nel nostro ambito un altro impiego, difficilmente peggiore dell'attuale, si riesce facilmente a trovarlo.

Scrivo questo post più per me che per te. Lo scrivo a te per ricordarlo a me. Ho avuto modo di lavorare con diversi colleghi esteri europei ed extra-europei. L'unica differenza che ho notato non è nelle capacità/competenze tecniche/lavorative ma nel farsi rispettare come professionisti. La consulenza e il body-rental in Italia hanno svalutato enormemente il professionista ICT ma dobbiamo sforzarci per far rispettare il nostro lavoro ed ottenere di più.

In bocca al lupo! :)

Consider moving to Fürth (there is a subway connection between Fürth and Nürnberg, takes about 15 minutes and the ticket is the same price as the ticket for riding around Nürnberg). Fürth is a bit dull, but certainly cheaper.
Erlangen is also an option, but apartments there are rare and expensive (because of the University and Hospital, Siemens, Areva etc.) and you will have to go by train/bus, spending more time and money on transport between those cities.

true,Roky1989,EURO,European Union,"Some points were already raised about a reorganisation of the EU, that I find really interesting. I'm from Slovenia that has been a part of a federation gone REALLY REALLY bad, when it went bad. Bellow I present my view of how the Union should look like. Please keep in mind that I'm a supporter of a European federation, but I won't use the word much and talk about the Union and it's institutions instead as they are more tangible right now.


Here are some points about the functioning of the Union:

- EP gets the right to initiate legislation

- the Commission President becomes the person proposed by the party with the most votes - no need for coalition building* &amp; the Commission Presidents proposed Commission is subject to a parliament in which support isn't guaranteed - like now famof. The Commission's legislation has to go through the EP and CMEU.

-the Council of Ministers of the EU right now only tables the legislation the European Council has agreed upon beforehand. I'd like to see it become some kind of second chamber of the EP, with the right for initializing legislation, amending the EP's legislation or vetoing it and visa-versa.

- the European Council should be abolished as there is no need for it. It makes the EU slow to react as everything has to be agreed upon between the EC members (heads of Member States) in only some sessions per year &lt;- I claim it's one of the main reasons the Euro crisis hit so hard. CMEU represents the interests of Member States just enough. The heads of states or governments should tell their ministers what the legislation should look like and they should agree between themselves how and what - like they ultimately do also right now. It's just wasting time and money.

- a common European Military, but with only half or less of the military of each member state** (I know this is really weird, read my explanation below)


Here is something that I personally would like to see:

- the institutions should be spread out -&gt; right now Brussels is the de facto capital of the EU, which makes the whole institution seem distant and unworldly. Especially to (older) people of former socialist republics as they didn't have much chance to see the world. The Commission should stay in Brussels, the EP should be relocated to it's official seat - Strasbourg and CMEU should have it's seat somewhere else. This would make it harder to lobby for legislation and bring the institutions nearer to the people. If the members of different institutions want to talk they can use modern communication methods or sit on a train or plain and go there. Let's make them work for their money. :-)


The EP should represent the citizens and have the right to initiate legislation. The CMEU should represent the interests of the Member States and have the right to initiate legislation. And the Commission should represent the Union and have the right to initiate legislation.

Ultimately, it's too soon for the EU to become a federation. It has to overcome this crisis, reorganize and become a confederation first, as it hasn't reached it's full extent and then push for a federation. This could take another 40 or more years but it's totally worth it, if it's build to last and not to please the people of one particular time period.

--------
*I like how there's no need for real coalitions in the EP and how legislation gets amended because the amendments are good and not because they were tabled by a member of the ""right"" party or political orientation. I'd also like to see this with legislation initiation.

**A Yugoslovan scenario has to be prevented. Right now it's impossible, even though some people claim otherwise. The EU's Member States are in the EU voluntarily (YES, you too UK), their borders are mostly set (ok... Slovenia and Croatia are lagging behind... again) and there is no common military that could be wielded in the face of state's that want to cede. No country will dare to go against people of another just because they want to leave the Union. The EU still needs a common European military as it turned out that coordination in the Battlegroups is really bad. I also don't see Germany dispatch it's military together with the Polish and the Portogese ones to deflect an invasion of Turkey in Greece and succesfully coordinate their counter. (this is just an example I had to make. I don't think Turkey would attack Greece.) But to avoid another Yugoslavia, that would probably eclipse the Balkan Wars themselves, it's also necessary for the European Army's maximum strength to be the same as the combined military power of the Members or even a tad weaker - half or less of each Members military should be merged in a common European Army. It should be a fast reaction force in case of large scale industrial and natural disasters and for the primary defence of the Union's territory and area of influence. It should also act as a hub for coordinating once/if some EU Member militaries join in potential fighting or relief operations.",0,1380235525,null,0,1380237563,0,ccg2dr9,t3_1n6pnf,t1_ccg2dr9,t3_1n6pnf,null,1429331712,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,Fairwolf,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;but I very much doubt you can class the tongue spoken by the vast majority of Scots today as a completely distinct language from English.

It's a language that pre-dates modern English. The basic tree goes:

Old English &gt; Middle English &gt; Early Scots &gt; Middle Scots &gt; Modern Scots

Old English &gt; Middle English &gt; Early Modern English &gt; English. 

It was considered a seperate language at the time of the treaty of Union. The only reason it's been devalued into a ""Dialect"" was due to a deliberate effort by the Scottish School board to stamp out both Gaelic and Scots, because they were considered ""Uncivilised languages"" compared to English, with Gaelic being referred to as ""A language of barberous people"" and the Education board's opinion on Scots was: ""...it is not the language of 'educated' people anywhere, and could not be described as a suitable medium of education or culture"". 

Scots -is- a language, it has ALWAYS been a language. The notion that it's a dialect of English is absurd. It's like claiming that Danish is a dialect of Norwegian, or Portuguese in a dialect of Spanish. 

As to ""The tongue spoken by the vast majority of Scots today"" they aren't speaking Scots. They speak Scottish English, which is English with several Scots loan-words, which is why English people can understand it ""Once they get an ear for the accent"". They're two very different things.
