Geographically speaking, why not. People just use that argument because it's easier than justifying themselves.

Culturally speaking, they are not European. Maybe Istanbul feels like Europe, but not Ankara. 

They are quite keen on religion and they are muslim. It's not an official reason (and can't be), but it's enough for many people to not want them in. It's not because they are muslim, it's because they have a very different religion than the rest of Europe (and it's not like it's Buddhism).

They are big. So they would be newcomers but already have an important role and power. This isn't compatible with the doubts about their culture difference.

They have a large diaspora from the middle-east, which isn't really ""European"". Again it's not an official reason but it's doesn't help.

They are in conflict with Cyprus.

They are seen as a strong ally (or rather muppet) of the US. With their large size it would feel like giving the US a strong political power in the EU.

They're too close to the war-zones and Islamic countries to be in the comfort zone of many people here. 

They know Europeans don't want them in, and they've stopped talking about it. It looks like they don't even want it anymore, which is fine for the rest of the EU.

So yeah, it's probably not a good idea to let them in while they dispute the existence of one of the current members. If you even go down the route of ""But Turkey is a big and important country and Cyprus is a small unimportant country"", then the whole concept of the EU would have failed :)

To give you an example of what this would mean in the USA right now: Turkey is Mexico, they attacked and took over a 3rd of Texas and claim Texas does not exist as a state while trying to create a new country called Mexican Republic of Texas. The former Texans fled to the Northern part which is part of the USA and more Mexicans moved to the Mexican Republic of Texas after being given incentives to do so.. these people feel very Mexican obviously and feel that the territory belongs to Mexico. So: What do you think of Mexico joining the United States of America under those circumstances?

&gt;Hitler, both in public and in private, expressed strong disdain for capitalism, accusing modern capitalism of holding nations ransom in the interests of a parasitic cosmopolitan rentier class. He opposed free-market capitalism's profit-seeking impulses and desired an economy in which community interests would be upheld. He distrusted capitalism for being unreliable, due to its egotistic nature, and he preferred a state-directed economy that is subordinated to the interests of the Volk.

&gt;Hitler took a pragmatic position between the conservative and radical factions of the Nazi Party, in that he accepted private property and allowed capitalist private enterprises to exist as long as they adhered to the goals of the Nazi state. However, if a capitalist private enterprise resisted Nazi goals, he sought to destroy it.

Just because the Nazis did not go as far as to nationalise all industry doesn't mean that they weren't anti-capitalist, rather it seems private enterprise was tolerated out of pragmatism since, as you said, the most important thing was to keep production going.

Yes. I agree with you on the facts, it's just I would label them as being neither anti-capitalist nor pro-capitalist. Hitler's idea was of a national community (*[Volksgemeinschaft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksgemeinschaft)*) acting as one for the good of all of its members, and in competition (especially violent competition, which the Nazis regarded as inevitable and desirable) with other nations. The acquisition of natural resources through military conquest was part of that, and was regarded as necessary for Germany to attain prosperity.

With that outlook on life it followed that who owned the factories wasn't be considered particularly important, and as you quote they ""allowed capitalist private enterprises to exist as long as they adhered to the goals of the Nazi state"".

I'm not sure that http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005479 is a reliable source, since it says: 

&gt; African German mulatto children were marginalized in German society, isolated socially and economically, and not allowed to attend university. Racial discrimination prohibited them from seeking most jobs, **including service in the military** [my emphasis]

My understanding is that many of them did serve in the military, Wikipedia [says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people_in_Nazi_Germany):

&gt; On the other hand, a number of blacks served in the Wehrmacht. The number of German blacks was low, but there were some instances of their being enlisted within Nazi organisations like the Hitlerjugend and later the Wehrmacht.

You don't have to be a Bush-doctrine-supporting, liberty-spreading neocon to consider that we are affected by things happening outside our borders and it is vital to protect peace and stability beyond our own neighbourhood. 

I can think of plenty of examples where Europe could have used more capable military despite the end of the Cold War.

First and foremost, the Yugoslav Wars - a shameful episode in the recent history. Europe sat idly and watched genocide and crimes against humanity happen at its own doorstep, unwilling and unable to do anything about it. It took the USA to step in from the other side of the planet.

More recently, Libya. As Gaddafi's regime was reeling, it was prudent from both moral and pragmatic standpoints to intervene. All we needed to do was to aid the rebels with equipment and provide them air support - minimal risk to our troops and relatively little material cost. And we didn't have the resources to do even this without the help of the Americans.

Thirdly, Somalia etc. Protecting our trade routes.

This is before we even consider the broad picture, the overall geopolitical landscape fundamentally determined by USA's military hegemony - the *pax Americana*. It is hard to imagine what the world would look like without it, but it certainly would be less cosy from European point of view. 

As much as we like to contrast the peaceful and civilized Europe with the imperialist US, Europe is implicitly relying on America's military power in its broadly-understood defence. I am convinced that if it wasn't for the US, European countries would soon find themselves spending a lot more on military force, despite their rhetoric.

Let me make it clear before you continue reading: I do not care for assimilation and I do not consider it vital for the progression of society.)

I just did a quick search for reliable information on ethnic groups in France, but discovered instead the interesting fact that ""it is illegal for the French state to collect data on ethnicity and ancestry"" in their census. So, I'm working now on rough estimates. It's true that Scotland's population is predominantly white; in the 2001 census, our population was estimated at 2.01% non-white, and the 2011 census data on ethnicity is not out yet (as there will be additional quality assurance beforehand). To an extent, I completely agree that it is harder for me to understand the French situation, when your white population was estimated at 85% in 2003, compared to our 98% - but I still have many objections to common rhetoric in the UK on immigration policy, and I would welcome any immigrant to this country with the provision that they have an interest in some level of integration and we have the infrastructure to sustain them. Obviously, I don't want to take ""all of France's North African immigrants"": France's North African population exceeds Scotland's entire population, since France's population itself is thirteen times that of Scotland, and France accumulated those immigrants over a long period of time, not all in one mass exodus. Sure, if they came here, they could ""breed [us] out in a generation"", but they'd also be homeless and starving.

What I am contesting is that an individual's ethnicity has a strong impact on their ability to integrate with another country, especially as my definition of ""integration"" is solely the ability to contribute to society in that country. That definition probably differs from yours; I don't consider integration to be a rejection of multiculturalism. I essentially agree with what Wikipedia says on [social integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_integration): ""Social integration requires proficiency in an accepted common language of the society, acceptance of the laws of the society and adoption of a common set of values of the society[; ...] it does not require assimilation and it does not require persons to give up all of their culture"". I don't believe ""being Middle Eastern"" means this social integration in Scotland is not possible. I do not believe that a person living in Scotland must rescind their national identity, and therefore I have no issue with foreigners living here and continuing to identify as a member of their native nationality. So long as they can live within the law, work, and pay taxes, why shouldn't we take them? I don't understand any argument against immigrants ""taking our jobs"", because a fair assessment of job candidates gives the position to the person deemed best suited to carry out that job. If that's an immigrant and not a Scottish or white person, then great; another well-skilled worker rightfully exercises the ability to secure a job, and that should benefit both our economy and our job sector.",0,1357056915,null,0,false,0,c7p8arb,t3_15r3fn,t1_c7p8arb,t1_c7p7wsj,null,1430824404,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

If you add all the European forces together, you get quite a big army, enough to have kicked Muammar's ass on it's own especially since we didn't commit our full armies so we would have had more to fall back on.
  

The big difference between European and American military operations is that our public opinion is much less tolerant of collateral damage which causes our commanders to be much more cautious and less effective from a pure war fighting point of view.  To be clear, the overly cautious nature of Europeans is not always a good thing, we noticed this in Bosnia, Kosovo and Rwanda in the 90's but it's not always bad as we tend not to invade first and ask questions later as the US did in Iraq. 

But currently, an fully committed European army, could kick the ass of most countries baring the real big ones like the US Russia and China.  At least in the first destruction part of a war.  The occupation part would be hard, but that's not different than it is for the US as we have seen the past decade. 

So it's less a ""issue"" of military hardware but more an ""issue"" of our not wanting to fight so much.

I think that's not completely true. We call it the *European* Union for a reason. The goal of the EU (or ECSC c.1950) was to provide peace, stability, perhaps unity and eliminate war in *Europe*. The EU's remit is not to provide those things for the whole world, as much as it (we) would like to. 

Yes, Europe as a continent is an arbitrary and some times ambiguous line. However that's our line which ultimately determines what is European and what is not. It's unfortunate that one country can be outside there and thus be considerably less likely to join simply because of bad luck of location, but that is indeed a legitimate argument in this instance.

The EU's top goal is not to create unity in the world it's to create unity in Europe. If, geography, Turkey is not in Europe then it is not part of the main EU objective. However, that wont stop Turkey, nor should it. 

If there's enough in Turkey's favour in terms of culture, democracy and human rights then there isn't a reason Turkey should join. It just can't be considered part of the main EU objective because it isn't. It's part of a wider objective, the objective that necessitates EU states being the largest givers of aid (per capita) on the planet.

That's very vaguely where the *'no Turkey in the EU because Turkey's not in Europe'* people are coming from. Kinda, sort of.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"I agree with most of what you said, though you emphasize too much on the ethnic/color factor although I didn't really speak of ethnicity, but rather of cultural differences. Granted, however, that color difference does play a role in integration, by both the majority who may discriminate on those who look different, and the ethnic minorities themselves who may feel and want to be different/separate from the rest (communitarianism). 

I feel integration, and social integration as well, is only possible when immigrants stay relatively few in numbers. I don't think it's possible to have a peaceful integration if immigrants are numerous enough to form ethnic neighborhoods, entire communities where they wouldn't need or have the opportunity to interact with the native culture and population. Many people say countries form ethnic ghettos with their immigrants, but it seems to me many times ethnic neighborhoods are formed by the immigrants themselves. No country decided to create a Chinatown. It created itself, by Chinese immigrants deciding to go live where other Chinese people did, and in time formed a Chinatown on their own. Thus Chinese immigrants are often not at all socially integrated, though, contrary to African immigrants, they tend to not resolve to violent crime or form ethnic gangs. 

If in small numbers, immigrants seem to integrate, socially and in general, very well. But when a country like France lets in 200,000 immigrants each year, most of them coming from Africa and the middle-east, integration is painful. 200,000 a year is enormous, equivalent to the population of Aberdeen, and to that of the French city of Rennes (11th largest city). It makes integration especially more difficult when there already are massive integration difficulties with immigrants (or children of immigrants) who are already here. The integration of immigrants has been on the forefront of public debate in France since a decade at least and yet we're still importing massive numbers of unskilled labor from third world countries, although we do already have unskilled and massively unemployed immigrant populations here.

That's why I'm for restricting immigration more. From Africa and the middle east because that's where most immigrants to Europe come from, and because since they're of a very different culture, their integration is harder than for, say, a Spaniard or Pole. Not to mention historical and cultural factors will often lead some African youth immigrants not wanting to integrate, and hating France (even though Spain and Italy suffered bloody conquests in the past from France, they have largely moved past historical differences - and I've never heard a Spanish immigrant complaining about how Napoleon massacred Spanish people or something). 

The situation is very complex and I don't want to seem like I'm generalizing, but do your country a favor, and support parties who would rather prefer selective immigration of skilled workers, and not massive imports of unskilled labor, especially if they're from outside Europe - and thus you'd avoid the problems massive immigration countries like England, Sweden, France and Germany have.",0,1357059227,null,0,false,0,c7p8qhv,t3_15r3fn,t1_c7p8qhv,t1_c7p8arb,null,1430824603,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Dogs helped us hunt, and now they protect us which isn't far from what they originally did in their wolf packs (except for small dogs, I don't understand why people bred them other than using them as experiment babies). I don't understand the purpose of a miniature pig as well but it's not a regular pig (regular pigs are domesticated for food, miniature pigs are not).

&gt;In any case, meat is meat, and animals are animals.

I agree, but don't forget humans are animals as well. I would try human.

&gt;The only thing that matters morally speaking is IMO what the other people involved (more specifically: other sapient beings) have to say about the whole thing. This is why it's bad to eat one person's pet, but farm-produced dog meat would be an entirely different story, and also why it's ok to eat porkchops from a supermarket but evil to kill and cook your neighbours' pet miniature pig.

I agree, it's evil to kill anyone's pet and eat it regardless whether it's a miniature pig, dog, bird, iguana, or fish. Just like killing a neighbor's son or daughter and eating him/her is wrong. But miniature pigs, dogs, birds (aside from turkey, hen, chicken, and what-not), iguanas, fish (aside from most fish except some select pet store fish), were not and are not domesticated as a food supply. In Ecuador, they eat Guinea pigs but Guinea pigs were not originally domesticated as pets, they were domesticated as food. 

&gt;Likewise I don't see anything wrong, from a purely moral perspective, with eating human meat so long as the original owner of said meat consents.

What's wrong with farming humans for food?

Edited: the word ""domesticated"" I forgot the ""d"".

1. Klinsmann is saying when they have the ball they have to broaden it. He tells Schweinsteiger he has to get to the line and come back in again to make himself available for the ball. The argument with Lehmann is actually not with Klinsmann (you can see him leave the locker room before) but with Ballack. Ballack is arguing that he has to follow a player that runs to the side line. Lehmann is arguing no, Ballack needs to stay center. 

2. The commentator is saying it's the penalty shootout. The 120 minutes are over. Score is 1 to 1. Both goals scored in the second half.

3. Lehmann talks about how Oliver Kahn wished him luck before the penalty shootout and that was a nice gesture. When he practices penalty shootouts he tends to save 1 or 2 out of 20. He gathered information on the shooters before hand to consider what the shooter might do. There is also some tactics involved: the first shot he might not save, but he should save the second or third.

4. Oliver Kahn says there are times where you have to do something irregardless of yourself, and it was natural for him to wish Lehmann luck for the penalty shootouts because that is what a goal tender needs.

5. The last bit with Lehmann, he shows the camera the piece of paper with his ""shooter information.""

They are the same species, and since the miniatureness is a recessive genetic trait quite a few pigs are born that should be miniature but then become regular (plural metric tons) sized.

They are also a very new kind of pet, only appearing in the 60s, but then that's not such a strange thing considering before the modern era all animals were kept exclusively for utility or food, not company.

&gt; I agree, but don't forget humans are animals as well. I would try human.

I wouldn't, but that's only because I'd be vary of harmful prions.

&gt; But miniature pigs, dogs, birds (aside from turkey, hen, chicken, and what-not), iguanas, fish (aside from most fish except some select pet store fish), were not and are not domesticated as a food supply.

Maybe, but would it even matter? Cows weren't domesticated for slaughtering, but for milk production, but most people don't have an issue with eating a steak.

true,elperroborrachotoo,null,null,"The first step of protection was and is *Arbeitslosenversicherung* (job loss insurance), which, among others, did pay a part of your last wage for a limited time. Payments are mandatory for ""normal"" employees. 

If you aren't eligible - e.g. you never paid or you our out of a job to long - there was *Sozialhilfe* (social aid) that would pay a small but bearable amount. You had to show you have no other source of income or assets. Social aid was managed by community (town or county) which had enough wiggle room to meet specific local needs.

Hartz IV reforms replaced the communal *Sozialhilfe* with a federal program, using their existing infrastructure of job centers, and added the requirement to accept job offers or suffer sanctions (i.e. no payments). Results:

There is a steady decline of full-time jobs, paired with an increase of shit jobs: underpaid, temporary, mis-qualified, seasonal, shift-work etc.

These people lose employment benefits that were once normal. They have to be ready to take a job - even if they didn't get one for years, they have to ask (!) the job center for vacation. Future for them is unreliable, making them predictably unwilling and unable to invest into their future. Why pay for a secondary education if it's the first thing to cut when you aren't employed next month? Try to make a relationship work if you get your shift plan a weeks ahead and your partner has a four-hour commute. 

In addition, there's a larger segment of ""Aufstocker"" that work a full or half-time job, and still don't meet the Hartz IV payments (the difference is paid to them by government). 

---

The biggest difference is the motivation: Sozialhilfe was designed to *grant* a decent life to everyone who couldn't afford it on their own, Hartz IV is designed to make them get a job, no matter what.

---

For balance: Arguably, *Sozialhilfe* old style couldn't have been financed anymore, so Hartz IV may well have saved out social system. Hartz IV is likely in part responsible for making the german economy as a whole resilent against the recent recessions.

NATO is as close to a unified armed forces as is necessary. It has the likes of France and the United Kingdom with their third and fourth largest-in-the-world military budgets to defend our European neighbours with. Not to mention we still maintain nuclear deterrents independent of the US. 

If the US withdrew its soldiers in Europe and refused to assist us, we would be fine. If Europe was then invaded (which it wouldn't be, but *if*) [all NATO partners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO), with a combined force of 1 100 000 (one million one hundred thousand) soldiers, would mobilise to protect which ever state happens to be in peril and try to repel the attackers until they are unable to retaliate. This is without mentioning that European nations are incredably advanced and are massively, if not overly well equipped. They have more better kit per head than an American per head due to the size of each European army compared to the number of troops.

Basically, what would happen if the US stopped being the global police, which would include not helping Europe, would be that Europe would get by defending itself and being a bastion of stability in the region. It would not try and fill American's shoes and be the global police because we do not have the will to, or desire to. We do not want to bend the world to our whim using military means and instead rely on soft power for global persuasion (The EU on the whole is a larger economy than the US after all).

Us Europeans aren't big fans of violence. We'll have large enough forces to protect ourselves but don't really desire more. Every single EU nation must not have the death penalty as a matter of principle. Having that penalty alone is enough to deny entry into the EU because we're so intensely against such acts. You see, there's a fundamental difference between Europeans and Americans. It hinges on how we project our selves around the world and how we like to treat people and how we would go about securing a better world. Our methods may not be terribly effect, perhaps not as effect as US ones, but they're effective enough.

So we should make sure we have the option of *invading them* to make sure we don't get nasty refugees stinking our streets or have to deal with oil prices going up.

&gt;But as a consequence, Europe won't have America's support like it did during the Cold War and today, so they need to start carrying their own weight and stop relying on the French and British to do everything when it comes to security and power projection.

I seriously fear you're *humanising countries*. Countries are not people. They don't get jealous. They don't not support people because they don't like the look of them or do support them because they have a crush. They do what they do out of benefit to themselves. They act rationally.

I'm rather amused that an American is complaining that they had to pay out for a war which they wanted fought on their behalf, but without any significant involvement.  

Americans are the ones who have the big chubby for overseas military adventures. Europe, as a whole, just isn't interested. As a continent, we have enough arms to see off any potential agressor, and we don't really want to spend more on overseas force projection, which is what the Americans actually want us to do.

true,Alpha023,TURK,Turkey,"Geographically speaking, we should be in EU with the same reason Cyprus had. If Cyprus is considered, geographically, an EU country then Turkey should be also considered European. 

Culturally I am afraid Turkey is kinda divided into two. There is this at least 40% of Turkey that is secular and more westernized than the rest. Look at Istanbul or Izmir(or any western cities)for example. However I believe with time, we can change. Just like we did in 1920s when Ottoman Empire disbanded and a whole new country born with more based on western values. However with the current government emphasising more on Islamic culture, things doesn't look so well right now. Now I come from a what you might call the elite part of Istanbul but everybody I know is either secular or are not associated with Islam. I don't believe 99% percent of the population is Muslim. If there was no peer pressure and more freedom of speech, we would be way more secular than most of the countries in the World. 

Yes, Turkey is big. And we are gonna need a whole lot of investment on the eastern part of Turkey to prevent any drug or immigrant trades. And the fact that these parts are all mountainous will be hard to control. 

I think the connection to the Middle East and to the islamic world would be better for EU since they can use Turkey as a gateway for anything that is related to these areas. 

Turkey is not in conflict with Cyprus right now. Well at least not militarily. My father side is Cypriot so I think I have more say to this issue than the European people have. Now all most of my family lives either in UK or in Turkey with frequent travels to Cyprus because of the conflict. In this issue I believe both sides are wrong. I believe what Greek Cypriots did was a big NO-NO around 1950s-1960s and Turkey tried its best there to protect its people. Now Turkish military may have used a little excessive force but it isn't any different what US did to Iraq or Afghanistan or what European countries did to rest of the world for colonization(what I am trying to say that anything country would have done the same thing if they were in that position). If Turkey did really intended to invade Cyprus, they would have done it by completely taking the Cyprus. Anyways the fact is the northern Cyprus is really in shitty condition compared to the Southern Side. I have been to both places. I have seen the difference. The fact is I don't like the Turkish or Kurdish immigrants to Cyprus from Turkey anymore than Greek Cypriots do. And I know that is one of the reasons Turkey cannot settle on any resolution with the Republic of Cyprus. But you can't just ask the 200 thousand people to leave and go back to Turkey. Especially to those that actually born in Northern Cyprus. The Greek Cypriots are not really excited about any settlements either. They are acting to overaggressive to the issue and are not really trying to use any kind of empathy(What I am trying to say that they are looking at the issue on only one point of view). I can't blame them because probably they were taught like that after the ""Invasion of Cyprus"". 

The connection to the US isn't something that will make a big difference to EU. Lets all be real, It's not like US doesn't have any influence on any EU countries. 

The closeness to the war-zones  never effected the people of Turkey. Except the issue in Syria. That is the result of the bad decision of our government and the fact that other countries are not doing anything to help Turkey to protect and feed the immigrants from Syria. The issue with Kurdish terrorists(""seperatists"") doesn't seem to be resolve with any military force unless we fully attack on the terrorist group as well as the cut the funding from the kurds in Europe. Not to mention, we have to stop the drug supplies to EU which basically funds the whole kurdish terrorists. 

Another issue with Turkey for joining to EU is that people in EU sees EU kinda like a Christian union. And lets all be really people are also afraid of Muslims from the Middle East because of those live in EU(even though they are different)

There are more things to talk about but I am tired. If you don't agree with  me or just feel like to ask any question, don't hesitate to reply to me and we can argue this issue more specifically if you like

Zuerst: Du meintest vermutlich Sinn **ergeben**, etwas **hat** keinen Sinn wird hauptsächlich im Kontext von Bedeutungslosigkeit verwendet. ""To make sense"" hingegen weist auf logische Schlussfolgerung hin, passt hier also nicht wirklich.

Nummer zwei: Desaströs ist seit langem akzeptiert, und - wenn überhaupt man sich dieser Korinthenkackerei annehmen muss - ein Lehnwort aus dem Französischen. Wenn das so weitergeht, kann ich ja gar nicht mehr am restlichen Argument herumkritteln.

Letzter Versuch: Was ist das bitte für ein Schund? Keine Redaktion, die wenigstens ein bisschen Wert auf ihren Ruf legt (okay, ich weiß, ich weiß), würde derartige Formulierungen leichtfertig durchgehen lassen.

Also gut, nehmen wir mal an, du hättest einfach ein unglückliches Händchen in der Wahl deiner Beispiele gehabt. Passiert, also gehe ich trotzdem darauf ein. Unsere Sprache ist erstaunlich konsistent. Jeder ist am Ächzen und Stöhnen, weil es jedem so vorkommt als würden allmählich sämtliche Bestandteile unserer Sprache durch Formulierungen aus dem Englischen ersetzt. Wie gesagt, keinem würde es auffallen, wenn es nicht der Fall wäre. Wir sind so furchtbar unbeeindruckt von dem Gewöhnlichen, sodass bereits ein Minimum an vermeintlichen Veränderungen ausreicht, um die gesamte Bevölkerung der BRD in Angst und Panik zu versetzen. Aber wieso? Ich musste erst vor ein paar Tagen die Tür in /r/linguistics eintrümmern um einigen Sturköpfen klarzumachen, dass Code-switching der natürlichste Teil (mehr-)sprachlicher Entwicklung ist. Was ist an einem einwandfrei abgeleiteten Synonym für ""katastrophal"" auszusetzen? Wieso sträuben wir uns gegen eine höhere Auflösung, gegen mehr Lebendigkeit im alltäglichen Sprachgebrauch wenn doch gerade pun trains und Wortwitz-Imagemacros zu den am meisten geschätzten Sprachspielereien zu gehören scheinen?

Es wird sich einfach nicht ändern. Sprachen beeinflussen sich gegenseitig, und viele Nationen dieser Welt schreien im Einklang auf: ""Unsere Sprachkultur wird durch Fremdeinfluss zerstört!"" Aber keiner kümmert sich auch nur einen Scheiß darum, mal ein-zwei Worte in Google einzutippen. Man könnte ja einen Einblick in die tatsächliche Materie bekommen.

Ich kann sie mir erklären, diese Aversion gegenüber neuem Vokabular aus anderen Sprachen. Ein konservativ eingerichtetes Gemüt, das noch nicht einmal die entsprechenden Fremdsprachenkompetenzen aufweist... sicherlich. Da wird gewettert und gezettert.

But otherwise... you'll mostly be ignored. French people don't really have an admiration for their military. Most of the time we think that they are jerks. It's not like in the USA where everyone is proud of the military and being a veteran is something cool and etc. In France, no one cares, and those who care... don't like the military. 

But it's true that the members of the Légion Etrangère are treated a little better. Still not much, and a lot of people still think it's a place for foreign criminals trying to hide a dark past (but in reality it's not). 

Keep in mind that I'm just giving the my view of this,  based on anecdotal evidence, not scientific. 

Edit : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAdhCEICLV8 

Here's a video of their parade. They're badass because everyone is parading at 120 steps per minute and they walk at 88 steps per minute. Oh... and they are allowed to sing. Also the fact that, every other regiment, when passing in front of the Presidential Tribune, are split in two groups, one goes to the left of the presidential tribune, the other to the right. But not the Légion, because in the Légion, they stick together. So they all go to right together. Screw the President :-).

In the video, the guys at the start with their mothafucking 'staches n' beards (mandatory for them, btw) are the combat engineers of the Légion étrangère. They always parade first, because in combat they are always the first sent to the battlefield. That's why they are called the pionners.

Their conflict with Cyprus is a huge issue, so they have to solve that first if they would like to get in.

Sometimes in the news I hear about attacks in connection with Kurdish groups and AFAIK the Eastern part of the country is very undeveloped compared to Western Turkey in many aspects.

Turkey serves as a drug trafficking hub to Europe and if they were part of the EU it would be much easier to distribute that stuff in the continent.

NASA's SLS is starting to look more and more promising. Currently, the cadaver of Constellation program is beeing kind of ressurected; early draft of schedule lists 2017 as a date for Orion's manned lunar flyby with free return trajectory and 2021 for Orion manned lunar orbit. Neither of these are lunar landings, there is no LEM beeing designed and Altair was scrapped along with Constellation.

2032 is an early date for SLS Block II launch with 130t to LEO capability. Using either this or one of SpaceX heavy launch vehicles you can start thinking about going to Mars, multiple-launch LEO ship assembly beeing the most probable option.

In my observation, I've noticed an inherent difference in Europeans and Turks;  

It's the mindset, it's the rationality, it's the enlightenment and the alleviated sense of purpose of Europe that sets us apart. This may sound harsh, but I can not deny these truths, as most fellow Turks do, which in turn stagnates us. 

Turks do things haphazardly, we have a national attitude of 'last minute goal', the easier path is always chosen over all other ethical or moral paths which in turn doesn't solve or achieve, we are very polar in attitudes, we seek extremes, we don't understand specialisation, systems and routines are just not our kinda thing and most importantly of all,  we are emotion over mind.

*Everything* is fucking sentient. I wish people would stop using that term as a magic word for ""smart as a human"". It simply means you are capable of perceiving the world and act on that stimuli. A spider is sentient.

The word you are looking for is sapient, and no: elephants and dolphins do not qualify. That's not to say they aren't smart animals, but that's not the same thing.

In any case my point entirely is that purpose in domestication is meaningless for whether it is morally correct to eat an animal or not. You brought up the bull as an example of how a species not domesticated for its meat was by necessity used for it anyway in olden days. My question to you then: what do you think people do with dogs in times of starvation?

If you think the reason you shouldn't eat human is because that's not ""humanity's purpose"" then I shudder to ever face you in real life, when the reason is supposed to be that it's wrong and evil to kill another sapient being and end their life against their will.

In fact, I think you'll find, presuming from the fact that neither of use have brought up a religious argument in a debate about morals that we both share at least our sympathies towards an atheist paradigm, that things and species don't actually have a quantifiable purpose and that the whole point of life itself is seemingly to find a way to live and procreate on the terms of your species wherever and however, at the expense of other species if need be.

Regardless of whether dogs were domesticated to hunt or for slaughter it is not *morally* wrong to eat them. Purpose has no bearing in this.

Just decide on a popular MVC framework, and find tutorials for it online. And find tutorials for HTML, JavaScript and CSS. There are a million.

Major in something you would use web development _for_. Get domain knowledge. Domain knowledge + programming is like 100 times more useful than just programming. (At least when it comes to stuff like web development, not necessarily true for all other kinds.) Want to develop the next generation web-based ERP? Major in accounting / business administration. Want to focus on medical software like self-diagnosis web-MD websites? Major in medicine. Package tracking? Learn logistics. Amazon? Trade/retail.

""Pure"" programmers may work in deeply technical fields like writing device drivers. But a technically easy, put-a-database-on-a-website knowledge is like 10 times simpler, means everybody knows plenty of people who can do it and competition is huge. The only really big advantage is knowing the domain so well that people do not have to write detailed specifications for you, you can do a short analysis and then go coding. This is why you should focus on the domain knowledge.

The era of programmers who have a ""well, this is what the users wanted"" literal-minded approach is over, now we need people who are 80% analysts and advisors and 20% programmers because the high-level web frameworks like Ruby on Rails are so easy, any chump can learn it, so being only a programmer is nothing, and being someone who intimately knows the business needs of the given domain and requires no detailed specification is everything.",0,1357116878,null,0,false,0,c7pncyi,t3_15tdv4,t1_c7pncyi,t3_15tdv4,null,1430831697,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

true,KhanneaSuntzu,null,null,"Let me get this straight for you - most Europeans realize full well the US is not a friend. US policies have been selfishly unilateral and interested *exclusively*  in its security and oil interests. The US uses state department (US taxpayer) money to effectively bully, coerce or bribe foreign states, and that includes playing European nations versus one another. Individual European countries get relatively plush deals from the US, but only after we consent to de facto US dictates on air flight rules, security cooperations, extraditions, fly-overs, spying operations (I can point out at least three intelligence agency 'safehouses' in Amsterdam and the Hague to you, let alone the clandestine ones we know nothing about). 

The US is not well liked abroad. It is distrusted. The dollar is distrusted. The government is distrusted. Many go as far as distrust the 9/11 narrative in full, and that includes speculation among Dutch parliamentarians that 9/11 was in fact an inside job. Can you imagine? Your own allies regard the US *as being morally capable of killing a few thousands of is own citizens in a friendly soil PR exercise*.

In fact I personally express a strong desire to completely see the US vacate the world stage. Its military does not bring peace, it only brings corporate protection and secures trade deals. In fact I could well argue the US military presence world wide is causing massive bloodshed, supports right wing dictatorships and cultivates slave state production facilities. 

If the US would somehow find itself incapable of honoring its debts, for instance if the dollar would end up losing its reserve currency status, it would have to relinquish most of its military and bases abroad. I speak for myself when I strongly welcome that. At this stage I'd prefer the EU takes its chances. *there is no cold war strategic competitor*. Terrorism is a matter for law enforcement. 

If the ""pay american' would fall away I am also fairly sure we as Europeans would end up paying **a lot less** for oil. And we are globally at a point where lower oil prices effectively *equate* economic growth.

As your quip about ""disaster relief"", don't make me laugh. I read the wikileaks consular emails on what your own diplomats mean with your version of ""disaster relief"". So I sweep that argument of the table. It is ludicrous.

Exit baggage claim and purchase an RER return ticket to Paris.  Don't wait in line for the machines because you need a European credit card (chip).  Go to the booth to buy the ticket.

Take the RER-B to Denfert-Rochereau (the sign says TO PARIS, it will be direction Robinson/St Remi Les Chevreuse).

Change to metro line 6 (green) and get out at Montparnasse.  Stash your luggage in the lockers at the station, taking note of the opening hours.

Get back on line 6, and take the train to Bir-Hakeim.  Exit and admire the Eiffel tower, enjoy a walk through Champ de Mars.

Have lunch at [Au Derniere Metro] (http://www.auderniermetro.com/) a nice informal Basque restaurant and it's cheap too.  The pave boeuf with frites is great.  Be sure to try the tarte au basque too!

After lunch, walk North, stopping by Ecole Militaire, then continue until you hit the Seine. Walk east and check out Musee d'Orsay, and the Louvre across the water.  Keep walking east along the water, admiring the water and the galleries.  Check out Ile de la Cite, and Notre Dame.  Then head South a bit, to see the fountain at St Michel.  Wander around a bit, to find a cafe, where you can get a standing coffee.  If you have time, consider walking up rue St Jacques and checking out Park Luxembourg and/or the Pantheon.

Depending on whether you went to the park, either get on the RER to Denfert Rochereau, then transfer to Montparnasse via line 6 -OR- Get metro line 4 to Montparnasse to pick up your stuff.

Once you have your stuff, take line 6 to Denfert Rochereau, then transfer to the RER to the airport.

As you only speak English, the obvious choices are the UK and Ireland. While we pay little in fees for college here in Europe, the same colleges tend to charge non-EU nationals significantly more.

For example, University College Dublin (Ireland), for a degree in Computer Science we Irish will pay €2250 per year, Europeans will pay €7k per year but non-EU nationals have to pay €20k per year. This is the same with most of the colleges here and in the UK, where you'd also be looking at a fee of somewhere between £15k and £20k. It would also be a minimum of 3 years in the course to receive a BSc. 

I had a look at a Computer Science degree (taught in English) in a university in Sweden for you but the fees are still $19k for year 1, $13k year 2 and 3 so it appears your options in Europe may be limited based on the budget you have available.

I agree that a social minimum should always be granted but the other side should be discussed, too: getting money for decades (because that's what we are talking about, short-term unemployment is a completely different story, as it falls under ALG 1) without doing anything automatically means there are a lot of working people paying higher taxes for that.

Lol ? If they did'nt try that pissing contest with the russian, NASA would never have done anything, got no budget or exist seriously. What boosted NASA to what it became was actually the insane nationalist hype around it and space exploration. The moon race allowed NASA to even EXIST.

Better to try and fail than don't try anything. And if you fail try again. Maybe with something new. Then try again, and again, and then some more. Space tech is fully trial and error.

true,Ntang,UNSA,United States,"Hi, OP. Fellow 'murican here who wants to help out a young man. Let me get this straight:

* You want to live on 1500 EUR for an entire year.
* You want to spend less than 8000 EUR on tuition getting an associates' degree at an EU university
* You are ""about to"" learn Javascript and PHP using reddit university

Dude, none of this is reasonable. Europe is a wonderful place, but it is not a magical land of rainbows and unicorns and free everything.

Here's what you do. Go to a U.S. community college. Work part-time as necessary. Get your associates' degree and try to transfer to a 4-year school. Get major in comp sci. Work for a few years, and then go to Europe to get a two-year MS degree in something. There are many outstanding European universities that offer degrees almost entirely in English - not only in the UK. Look at the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Germany and the Nordic countries.

Don't have money? Like I said, work part-time while in school and get loans as necessary to pay for undergrad at an inexpensive state school. A solid CS degree will help you get a good-paying job after graduation to pay off said loans in a few years.

Don't worry about the language stuff. Sure, French or German or Swedish will help you get around better in each respective country, but it's not like a pre-requisite to going there. If you visit a foreign country and don't speak the language, just don't be a dick. Buy a handbook on the local language, read up on the plane, and be super polite. 

Most Europeans like Americans just fine. They just don't like assholes, just like Americans don't like Europeans who are assholes. We're not like two completely different people, when you get right down to it.

If you REALLY REALLY need to go travel in Europe, save up a few hundred bucks and go backpacking.

Many European voters no longer see the reason or need for funding their own armed forces. While smaller EU states (particularly in Central or Eastern Europe) are traditionally a lot friendlier, the wealthier, Western Europeans are pretty suspicious of American military power projection and continued investment. At the same time, they're not completely without a point - the Soviet Union is gone, and Russia is unlikely to invade Poland or the Ukraine or Germany anytime soon.

At the same time, we would probably advance American global interests better with Obama's pivot to the Pacific Rim, where countries who DO feel threatened by China are very eager to take the Europeans' place under our protective umbrella, and are willing to put resources in place to upgrade their defensive capabilities.

Ideally, I'd like to see a more global alliance of democracies - sort of a NATO for the globe.

No matter what sort of federal structure you put in place in the UK, you will continue to have these problems; even the federal idea pitched by the Lib Dems, whose support in Scotland is hilariously low, will still reserve welfare and pensions to the UK government. The Scottish Government has consistently been at odds with the UK government over the period of devolution, most poignantly now that Scotland continues to protect free education and universal health care while it is disassembled in England and Wales. I am very sorry for the people down south who suffer from the austerity cuts and I will always vote to protect them from it in UK general elections. However: with Scotland's budget controlled by the UK government, a parliament in which only 59 seats (of 650) are elected by the Scottish people has a ridiculous amount of control over Scottish spending. Add onto that recent observations that the private sector jobs that are ""replacing"" public sector jobs are mostly based in London and it's becoming increasingly obvious that the UK government is not equipped to improve the economy in Scotland or even serve the will of the Scottish people. Those Scottish people now have the mandate to go it alone if they choose - and why shouldn't they? It's not an isolationist movement; it will remain in the EU alongside the remainder of the UK, assuming that the south's growing Euroscepticism doesn't see them withdraw. Technically, this should be good news for the rest of the UK too: they get the government they voted for, without the divergent Scottish vote harming their favourite party's majority. I'm in favour of any movement, like the independence movement, that will greatly empower the Scottish electorate and afford them the right to be governed solely by the party they elect.

Kann ich so schon nachvollziehen. Diese geforderte Sensibilität und Rücksichtnahme sorgt dann aber auch schnell für den Vorwurf, dass Kritik am Judentum an anderen Maßstäben gemessen wird als bspw. Kritik am Katholizismus. Und das ist dann ehrlicherweise kaum zu entkräften und gibt den Stammtischbrüdern nach dem Motto ""nie darf man was gegen Israel/Juden sagen"" Vorschub.

true,Ricky_Boby,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;most Europeans realize full well the US is not a friend.

If that statement is true then I am truly sorry because most Americans consider Europe to be our friends and allies. I personally believe in a form of the [""special relationship""](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Relationship) as described by Winston Churchill expanded to include all of Europe.

&gt;The US uses state department (US taxpayer) money to effectively bully, coerce or bribe foreign states, and that includes playing European nations versus one another

Why would we do this to countries who are our allies? We even have no-spy and information sharing treaties with many western countries.

&gt;Many go as far as distrust the 9/11 narrative in full, and that includes speculation among Dutch parliamentarians that 9/11 was in fact an inside job. Can you imagine? Your own allies regard the US as being morally capable of killing a few thousands of is own citizens in a friendly soil PR exercise.

You've spent too much time on r/conspiracy. 9/11 was a terrorist event that has been proven as such form every legitimate study into it, including studies by independent third parties. To say it was an inside job for PR is like saying that the Dutch (I'm assuming you're Dutch) wanted to get invaded by Hitler to drum up sympathy from other western nations. If any of 9/11 was an inside job I can assure you that the citizens of the United States would have every politician striped from power and in jail.

&gt; In fact I could well argue the US military presence world wide is causing massive bloodshed, supports right wing dictatorships and cultivates slave state production facilities.

I'll agree with you that we have been in the wrong by trying to advance our interests through puppet dictatorships such as the Shah in Iran and ngo dinh diem in south Vietnam. I feel like we were wrong to take away the freedom of choice in their government of these country's citizens for our goals. Hopefully our government has learned it lesson from how badly these normally go.

&gt;Terrorism is a matter for law enforcement.

I wish that terrorists were just a simple street gang but in reality they far outgun law enforcement agencies. They are also outside of most law enforcement jurisdictions.

&gt;As your quip about ""disaster relief"", don't make me laugh. I read the wikileaks consular emails on what your own diplomats mean with your version of ""disaster relief"". So I sweep that argument of the table. It is ludicrous.

* As for your analysis of spy agency treaties, check your facts. You drag citizens of friendly countries of their owns streets and ""disappear"" them. This is causing a storm of resentment. And that is just the peak of the iceberg. 

* I talk to a gathering of about a dozen VVD, D66 and PvdA *parliamentarian* politicians 3 years ago. We were having drinks. We openly discussed 911 and the collapse of the WTC. They *volunteered* facts on how the demolotion worked, how long it takes to plant demolition charges and what the objectives might be. As such I conclude that ""truther"" thinking is normative (even if they don't do it out in public) and common among Dutch governmental parliamentarians. Live with this.

I think we've moved on from slavery, yes. I don't. however, think we've moved on from other things like say same sex marriage. I think you're being a little naive here. We're not the ultimate society. Far from it. There's plenty of horrible things we do that later generations are going to look at with disgust. I can't tell you what all of them are, because I don't know what they are, yet. Perhaps it'll be polution, perhaps same sex marriage, perhaps animal cruelty, perhaps some thing different that we don't think of as bad at all like *owning other animals*. 

It seems perfectly reasonable to us now, but it wont always. This is without even mentioning that different people have different ideas of what is good. A majority in Britain say the death penalty is a stupid idea, a majority of Americans in certain states, say otherwise. We're very like minded on a global spectrum but even there's a *huge* difference of opinion. Just imagine the difference of opinion between us (westerners) and Indian culture(s) or Chinese Culture or African culture(s)

&gt;Having entire consensus means that stuff like Syria continues to happen

It's extremely regrettable that people in Syria are dying because of a tyrant dictator who's only going to be ousted anyway so is just causing suffering for no reason at all. It really is awful. There's no denying that, but there's two things 

A) The west's solution (which is being blocked by Russia and China) is to do a Libya and effectively invade, or at least do a no fly zone and bomb the living shit out of the middle east *again*. You can see why a lay man might oppose that. 

B) What if a majority of nations suddenly decided that America was suddenly the enemy and *it* should be attacked, causing the deaths of thousands to millions of innocent civilians as happens in every Western war in the past two centuries.

&gt;but it isn't working.

I mentioned this before ""The west's solution (which is being blocked by Russia and China) is to do a Libya and effectively invade, or at least do a no fly zone and bomb the living shit out of the middle east again. You can see why a lay man might oppose that.""

I know that's not really why it's being vetoed. It's more to do with Russia protecting it's interests and allies in the middle east than anything moral. However, how are you ever going to get other nations to sign up to something new where they get less power than they already do. It's an unideal system but I think we forget how lucky we are to have this. Before that we had the League of nations and before that *nothing*. Before WWI, we had no UN substitute, no international organisation *at all* to inspect nations and make sure they don't go *starting a world war*. Making sure *world wars* don't happen is the UN's main objective. It was founded because of World War Two with the intention of making sure it never happens again.

The UN is a relatively weak international organisation, but compared to nothing it is practically the Terminator.

I don't know where you live, but in Nimes, Montpellier, Avignon, Orange, all the cities down south, I am not allowed into clubs, bars(some do, most don't) and people are afraid of you.

They see your shaved head and hear your English accent when you speak French, and they know what you are. 

On the other hand in Paris, especially on the 14th you are a fucking celebrity because they don't know what Legionnaires are like.

And in Nimes, where I live(2REI) the Arabs will jump you for no reason because of what you are. During the Ferias in Nimes it can reach total war with 2 sections or even a whole company going out to get revenge on the Arabs after someone has been badly injured.

Unfortunatly this is all mostly our fault as certain nationalitys have a tendency to get really drunk and destroy shit and beat people up. A guy I know is in jail in England for rape and theft, another had sex with a prostitute in Nimes and beat her up and didn't pay.
I have seen the interior of bars destroyed by Legionnaires. Cars flipped and windows smashed, police backing off calling for backup.

What I'd recommend is that you find a room in a shared flat in the city. You'll have a more authentic experience of the city and it will probably be cheaper.

What I would also say is for sharing a flat don't pay for anything before you've seen the flat and met the people. If that means you have to check into a hostel for your first few days / week here and spend that time viewing flatthen do it. Spend the next couple of weeks looking at places online and setting up viewings for when you arrive and go from there.

Why? Americans are no more stupid (or smart) than anyone else. Just because we have different views does not make us imbeciles, just as you are not an imbecile for having a different view than mine. That's the reason I read this sub-reddit, to hear different views from mine and to learn more about Europe and its people.

&gt; I regard the US government as deeply corrupt and dangerous.

I do as well. I regard *all* governments as corrupt and dangerous by their very nature. They are a necessary evil and must be closely watched and controlled by their citizens. The US government has become too large in my opinion and is in need of downsizing.

&gt;As for your analysis of spy agency treaties, check your facts. You drag citizens of friendly countries of their owns streets and ""disappear"" them. This is causing a storm of resentment. And that is just the peak of the iceberg.

In many respects I was referring to the US-UK-Canadian-Australian-New Zealand spy alliance. As to the attacking of friendly citizens, I can understand how that causes anger in other countries and I do not think American citizens condone such actions.

&gt;I talk to a gathering of about a dozen VVD, D66 and PvdA parliamentarian politicians 3 years ago. We were having drinks. We openly discussed 911 and the collapse of the WTC. They volunteered facts on how the demolotion worked, how long it takes to plant demolition charges and what the objectives might be. As such I conclude that ""truther"" thinking is normative (even if they don't do it out in public) and common among Dutch governmental parliamentarians. Live with this.

I sincerely hope this is not a common sentiment or was said in a joking or ""what if"" manner. A cover up of the proportions needed for 9/11 is practically impossible due to the amount of explosives needed to destroy the towers but more importantly the fact that these explosives would have had to be placed in positions impossible to reach without major, conspicuous construction. It would have taken hundreds of personnel including construction workers, airline officials, pilots, and government officials to pull of the attack. To keep all of these people silent about the murder of nearly 3,000 innocent civilians would be impossible.

&gt;You still support torturing regimes to this very day. In fact you cooperate with them all throughout the middle east. You rendition Europeans to these countries.

Ok, some people deny the holocaust and they're totally wrong, by denying them the right to speak we make them victims in the eyes of their supporters. If they're allowed to express their views there will be people to explain why they're wrong and they'll lose credit.

Really, freedom of speech is better for every one.

&gt;  But what is certain is that few people have done as much harm in history as those who deem themselves worthy of criminalizing ideas they dislike.
