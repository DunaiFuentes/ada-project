true,ingenvector,null,null,"Why are you set to study business in Germany? Germany is not a country with a good reputation for business schools and began adopting them only fairly recently. And even then, Germany often still holds on stubbornly to the traditional German business model which is something not found almost anywhere else. If you want to do business in Germany, business management proper may not be entirely useful to find work in Germany, since that option is somewhat limiting. Instead enroll into a programme that places heavy emphasis on subjects such as finance or acturial science. But then, in these programmes, Canada is just as good a consideration as anything Germany has to offer (e.g. Acturial science in the University of Waterloo is quite good). You would be much more successful identifying an industry you wish to conduct business in, studying that field, then obtaining an MBA. This is somewhat the reverse of what is done in most countries, but it is still the German way.

That said, if you do insist on studying in Germany, the most common recommendations would be University of Mannheim, Goethe University in Frankfurt, and the European School of Business in Baden-Wuerttemburg. You can find out more about these schools via your preferred search engine. 

Again though, if you want to study in Europe, look into Insead or HEC in France, or IMD or SBS in Switzerland, or the London School of Business, instead. These schools all have very good reputations and more importantly are internationally recognised. Or just stay in Canada. McGill, the University of Toronto, or UBC are all very good schools.

If it's such a small amount that basic subsistence is impossible, it wouldn't be useful for replacing any existing subsidies and lessening the 'welfare trap' of being disqualified for benefits as you earn more in the private sector.

If for example, the USA were to cut unemployment insurance, medicare, social security, disability assistance, medicaid and housing assistance for the old and poor in the states and replace it with a block grant of $10k for every adult, those who can't just get a job would be destitute and dependent on private charity to survive.  Giving everyone a small fraction of the cost of living does nothing to free them from having to work to live.  

Thirty five years ago, they did try an experiment in Dauphin, Manitoba, a relatively remote town in central/northern Manitoba, where for five years people of low income could apply for money in addition to whatever they might be getting from existing welfare services which would be moderately cut back the more you earn (25-50% clawback depending on luck of the draw, as it was testing the effects of various rates on behavior.)  The only demographics that significantly left the workforce were teenagers (who also stayed in school longer) and mothers.  Hospital visitations went down as well, since stress related health issues were lessened by people not having to worry about money so much.

As to staying in Canada, the average tuition for Canadian residents is about $3,000 per semester, or about $600 per class (you don't have to take exactly five courses a semester), for most programmes which is actually pretty cheap. I just finished my degree from UW without any debt. This despite going to school out of province. I found a place for only $350 per month. Business schools often have many courses in the summer where rent can drop to as cheap as $150 for the summer months. That said, rent wont be as cheap in places like Vancouver or Toronto, but there are good schools with nearby cheap living accommodations.

Business is not a hard programme. If finances were an issue, a part time job could easily pay your way through school plus pay off rent, food, etc. Some people I knew who took business worked full time jobs.

If you do go to Germany to study, keep in mind the smaller universities like Europa Universitaet Viadrina in Frankfurt an der Oder. At least in business, they are often as good as the larger universities and living accommodations can be quite a bit cheaper.

i don't know that shuttle bus, but i guess they should be on time: early in the morning there is less traffic. anyway, when i plan this kind of trip i always mentally add 10-15 extra minutes just because there could be an unforeseen difficulty, you never know

&gt; how much time will it take me to get from there to the aiport

wait a minute... doesn't the bus stop directly to the airport? btw which airport?

&gt; should I consider paying up 50euros for the taxi.

you can consider it, it's an easy solution. taxi driver can speed up a little if he knows you are in late. for this solution i suggest to talk with the reception of the hotel: they can book a taxi (in italian: prenotare un taxi per l'aereoporto) the day before, otherwise you have a little risk not to find the taxi early in the morning. 

&gt; Should I buy train tickets in advance if they are expensive last minute

there is not last minute option. local/regional trains have fixed price. ""le frecce"" (frecciarossa, frecciaargento, ecc) are the best and faster trains, and the sooner you buy it, the cheaper they are. there are also ""intercity"" train, cheaper than the ""frecce"" but a little slower, i don't know if prices varies..

I always liked the potato story:
Frederick the Great of Prussia saw the potato's potential to help feed his nation and lower the price of bread, but faced the challenge of overcoming the people's prejudice against the plant. When he issued a 1774 order for his subjects to grow potatoes as protection against famine, the town of Kolberg replied: ""The things have neither smell nor taste, not even the dogs will eat them, so what use are they to us?"" Trying a less direct approach to encourage his subjects to begin planting potatoes, Frederick used a bit of reverse psychology: he planted a royal field of potato plants and stationed a heavy guard to protect this field from thieves. Nearby peasants naturally assumed that anything worth guarding was worth stealing, and so snuck into the field and snatched the plants for their home gardens. Of course, this was entirely in line with Frederick's wishes. :

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's hard to say why do one over the other. One way you might think about it is likeliness you'll go to either place without doing the study abroad. 

I've done studies in latin america before spain (in spain now) and I get really surprised at a lot of the differences in the spanish (things you say in latin america but not in Spain typically). There's more academic awareness of Spanish grammar and conventions in Spain because in Spain they have RAE which 'regulates' that sort of thing, which is very bizarre from an American perspective. That's not to say that everyone in Spain speaks super properly (supposedly Salamanca is known for its super-''correct'' Spanish or something though). Like anywhere else people have their accents and dialects, they just may have more formal explanations for the grammar.

 Latin American Spanish is probably more relevant to your usage of spanish and in any case you need to be familiar with both but another way to look at it is that you have the rest of your life to immerse yourself in Mexico. 

It's great to go to Spain because it's Spanish speaking europe and that's a very interesting thing. Being in Europe is very fun and there's a bit more ease of mind because you stick out less, assuming you're a white or just very  American person. Everything's also very close and I personally just feel more free to move around because there's less uncertainty. I don't get nervous about being lost and being out late at night is normal, and I have more in common with people because there is a higher standard of living and more people have more education (this is not necessarily relevant in a city like buenos aires but it's worth mentioning). 

On the other hand, going to places in Central or South America is very special in its own way and there is also lots of value in being an 'outsider' when doing a study abroad, plus you will have the benefit of being a part of a study abroad program, which will give you guidance that you might not have if you were to plan an independent trip to South America on your own, while also giving you immersion (homestay maybe?) that you might not be able to find independently or in a shorter trip as easily. And although there are obviously breathtaking parts of Spain, Argentina has got to have some gorgeous wildlife and ecosystems that are totally different from anything you've seen. I definitely find myself missing latin/south America, and people say Argentina is really, truly A-MA-ZING as far as places to visit, study in, eat, see stuff, etc, and I'm sure it's extremely different from Mexico. 

Another angle is that you might compare touristiness? I'm not sure if you'll find yourself more immersed in one place over the other. Spainiards tend to not know english, but the big cities are obviously very touristy  (which isn't bad), I don't know how Argentina compares. 


wherever you do study I don't think the accent really matters. Hopefully in one mere summer you're not picking up a strong accent irreversible, right? In any case you should be adapting your accent to where you are at a given moment (try as hard as you can to speak like a spaniard if you go there for example) but there's no reason you can't switch. Obviously the accent will influence you but it shouldn't really matter. Whether you go to Spain or Argentina you will simply add another set of knowledge about dialects of Spanish to your experiences.

tl;dr the choice depends on you. I would love the opportunity to study for a long time in a place like Argentina. That said Spain has many things going for it. ",0,1381045136,null,0,1381098634,0,ccm088y,t3_1ntgy2,t1_ccm088y,t3_1ntgy2,null,1429228971,6,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,6

You see Julius Caesar had the city of Aleysia under siege. The rebel against Roman rule, Vercengetorix, tried to use a weapon-the fact that the Romans may have hearts, so he sent all of the old people, women and children(anyone unfit to fight) out of the city. Caesar had built a wooden wall around the city to help the siege. The Gaulic women and children reached Caesar's wall. Vercengetorix hoped that he would a)save them due to Caesar's assumed compassion and b)spare himself resources. 

But Caesar was a smart man. So he didn't let them pass. And they wandered between the Romans and the Gauls for a few days. Untill Vercengetorix broke. He couldn't take it. So after many of the people who were supposed to escape died Vercengetorix took them back. 

Now, can you guess who eventually won the battle? The heartless Romans or the Gauls?

Just the CV requirements themselves vary from country to country, some want photos and/or professional accomplishments etc. I created specific versions of my application and CV for each company.

Where I live, and in much of Northern Europe, the interviews are usually informal, open and friendly. I work in consulting with international clients. The last couple of interviews were like meeting new friends. 

My papers and application was present, but it was never used like an agenda. We had a nice, long chat about my work experience and my personal life (relocation, family, finances). 

It was a frank discussion about the company, the position, the skills needed and what I could and couldn't do. Products, services and company strategy was explained and open for questions. 

As they had already ""checked"" me out informally and talked with my references this was also discussed (positive and negative). Other candidates had been formally tested for basic knowledge during the interviews but we skipped that part. 

They did bring in people from various departments that I would work with to explain their roles and challenges. After a few hours I finally had to leave, but I still had more questions and they wanted to show me more. Still, I felt I had a good enough understanding of the job. We just didn't have any more time left on the clock so we had to end it. I accepted the offer.

true,ingenvector,null,null,"One of my favourite subjects in German history is the intellectual history of Germany from the time of Humanism (what the Renaissance is called outside of Italy) and the Reformation to the destruction of Germany's domination on science in large part due to the Second World War. It is, I argue, a genuine Golden Age.

From the Baroque onwards, the intellectual development of the German lands, awoken to its potential, began to rapidly grow increasing in both its radicality and innovation. Major achievements in music and aesthetics, increasingly becoming more avant-garde, began to mark the transition towards the Enlightenment. Thus, we have the important developments in music starting from Bach through Mozart onwards to Beethoven where the predictive power of musical analysis begins to end and every work after is a response back to Beethoven. Germany revolutionised philosophy into one of the great philosophical schools: German Idealism, initiated by Kant. This would lead later to Existentialism, Phenomenology, and contribute significantly to Analytic philosophy. It was in this time that German universities began to reorganise to focus on philosophy and natural sciences removing the dominance of theology from dictating the direction of studies.

This leads to the Klassik era which is marked by increasing scientific proficiency. This era witnessed the beginnings of the comprehensive university research institute. It was in these institutes that the endeavor of scientific practice in a scientific community was first wholly unified in a rudimentary way. Patronage would not hold dominance any longer in funding a scientists career nor would exclusive national academies be the only significant conduit of scientific practice. In this time mathematics began to flourish, particularly in Goettingen.

With the coming of the industrial revolution, many physicists and engineers became entrepreneurs making their fortunes on important technologies founding firms, many of which still exist today. From these firms came the industrial laboratory and the beginning of academic domination in chemical sciences. The humanities, not to be forgotten, also witnessed new and important developments such as the development of philology. Much of what we consider in ancient Greek texts are owed to the interpretation of German philologists who became enamored with the Socratic dialogues and Aristotle.

Then, naturally, there is the modern era. Einstein's annus mirabilis, the development of quantum mechanics, advances to cosmology, aeronautics, ballistics, materials, radiometric imaging, etc. are all fields with prominent or dominant influence by German scientists, particularly in physics. In its time, Germany was the greatest scientific nation on Earth rivaling France, the United Kingdom, and the USA combined, all of which were scientifically conservative (only in theoretical sciences, in applied sciences, France and the United Kingdom were more developed). Lack of organisation and insufficient will to implement meaningful or significant research programmes would not come until the 1940s by which time the UK and USA finally began to reform their universities under the German model and fund powerful research departments. Naturally, with the end of the war and Germany's destitution for spare funding and the emergence of the USA as the world's new great scientific power, our little narrative ends here (but an interesting question regarding American self-interest in rebuilding European science emerges, but alas, this is off topic and so I digress).

I tried not to go too much in detail and to be consise - I have left much out of my little narrative. Do keep in mind that while Germany's advances were considerable, it was by no means complete or dominant over other nations except in physics in the early 20th Century. Up until then, the German lands were still socially and technologically backwards in many important ways and it was necessary to supplement its deficiencies from other nations, particularly the United Kingdom. I add this compulsory caveat because the subject is Germany, it would most likely not be necessary if it were any other country. That, and I don't want anyone to make the mistake that I would ever fawn.

 If anyone is interested in this subject even after reading my obtuse rambling, these are my sources:

As one can tell, my focus is largely on the hard sciences. For a more general approach to this subject, Daniel J. Boorstin has an excellent series of books covering intellectual history from early human history to the contemporary era.

Another interesting field of study in Germany history, but I omitted discussion of due to its content, is Nazi foreign policy which I find highly fascinating. I also recommend another book from this time period pertaining back to science: The Nazi War on Cancer by Proctor.

I don't know how it's like in Germany, but I suppose I might find out one day if I choose to persue a PhD there.

Check OUAC (Ontario Universities Application Centre) which is where you apply to certain, if not all, universities in Ontario. The base fee is $135 plus $12 transcript fees per transcript plus an additional choice fee of $44 if you want to apply to another school beyond the first choice plus supplementary fees to the schools themselves. The University of Toronto charges $100, I've averaged the charges to $68.

Let's say you wish to apply to n schools in Ontario alone, plus UofT as a first choice. The application cost would be:

C(n)=135+12n+44n+100+68n=235+124n (I wonder if Reddit supports LaTeX... $$ E=mc^2 $$ ... I guess not)

Then, for two universities plus UofT, C(2) = $483. The cost increments $124 for each additional university from here (I didn't use the most sophisticated math, but it'll work). If I remember correctly, UBC charged $100. Expect to pay on average $70-$100 for direct applications to any non-OUAC university.

Germany likely has something similar and you could potentially be also caught with extra fees like notorising or translating transcripts for example. Without direct experience, I can't help you any further in this regard and I am already broaching speculation.

Assess realistically your options and apply only to the schools which you think are worthwhile.

Here's what sucks about multicity, compared to the other services:

**1) The cars are awful in almost every way.**

They are terrible to begin with: Very uncomfortable seats that won't slide back far enough for even slightly taller people to drive comfortably (I'm only 1.90m and I'd need for the seats to go back at least another ten cm for me to consider a C-Zero for any trip longer than 30 minutes). I have absolutely no problems driving a Mini Cooper, which is a much, much smaller car. Yet somehow, Citroen figured anyone over 1.80m can go fuck themselves. There's even a ton of legroom in the back row when I have my seat all the way back, so there'd be plenty of space for them to go back further!

They're taller than a car of that size and width should be, which makes it feel like you're driving an old 2CV - wobbly and unstable.

And then it gets even worse: The cars have some of the lowest possible configurations. None have parking assist, most have no **interior lighting**. Yes, you've read that right - imagine it's night, you get into a car you've only driven a few times before, and you are supposed to figure out how to switch on the headlights in total darkness. And you're paying for every minute you spend fumbling with the knobs.

By comparison: Every DriveNow Mini or 1 series coupé has the highest possible configuration. The 1 series convertibles and X1s lack the mediacenter, but are otherwise very well configured, too. And yeah, absolutely all of them have both parking assist and interior lighting. Of course.

**2) The App is total shit.**

On average, in 100MBit WiFi, the App takes between 30 seconds and 1 minute to figure out where the next available car is. That is, if the server is responding at all, which it often isn't. DriveNow consistently finds the next car in under ten seconds, whether you're in a fast WiFi or on 3G.

Every service allows you to reserve a car you've found using the app for free for 15 minutes. Using DriveNow, it takes about five seconds from the moment you first hit the button till you've hit the confirmation button and you get the final confirmation. Using Multicity, this takes another 30 seconds to a minute. Again - if the server is responding at all.

Plus - every other App will show you the reserved car on the map. Multicity used to only show you all of the other available cars but hide the one you've reserved. Now this has been fixed, and you have a one-third chance of the app doing the former, a one-third chance of the app doing the latter, and a one-third chance of the app not displaying any cars at all.

**3) The service is total shit**

Now, if you've actually managed to find one of their cars, and you've even reserved it, too, by my experience, you have a 25% chance of the car either not opening, or, if it did indeed open, not starting.

Plus, while every competitor offers special rates while parking (for example, DriveNow will lower the rate to 10c/min while the engine is off and the car has been locked from the outside), Multicity does not, so it's completely useless for shopping.

After trying the service for a while, and testing out the others at the same time, I've decided to let them know about my experience and so in January, I sent their support a long and detailed Email on what it's been like using multicity, how they could improve and gain me back as a customer, and that they should, by god, try the other services themselves, to see how it can be done better. All I got back was a standard Email with text snippets addressing some of the criticism with standard bullshit like ""We're working on X"", ""Y has been vastly improved"", etc.

By contrast - I've emailed DriveNow in the past to address a problem that occured in the calculation of the cost one booking, and they sent me a personalized Email explaining what happened and that they'd fixed it - before my credit card was even charged.

**In conclusion:** I still use multicity, when there is absolutely, positively no other vehicle in a 1.5km radius. I avoid it like the plague, since it really is just that bad. Sorry for the long, venting post, but I just hate when someone just tries to phone a project this big in. They had the first all-electric fleet in Berlin, and instead of using that potential, they half-assed it like a motherfucker.

**TL;DR:** Fuck Citroen Multicity. If you want to use a carsharing service, try DriveNow or car2go!",0,1381051020,null,0,false,0,ccm0zre,t3_1nrw8b,t1_ccm0zre,t3_1nrw8b,null,1429228615,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

As other said the cheap supermarket chains (called ""discount"" here) are Dia, Lidl, Aldi, Leader Price. Not all of them are in Vincennes. Google them with ""à proximité de Vincennes"" (=near). They are small size, with little choice, poor quality, really cheap by french standarts.
But if you already went to Dia and it didn't solve the issue you need to take a different approach. Because that's more or less the cheapest you'll find. 
Maybe you should give us a little bit more background info so we can help better. 
Like are you a student ? Did you already live on your own in the US ? What is your budget and how much is your rent ?
 
Because cheap supermarket won't be enough to solve the issue alone. What is really expensive in Paris and surroundings is the housing. Let's say you are a student, your income is your parent´s allowance of 800€ per month. If you are paying 600€ per month for your studio you can't make it with the remaining 200€. So you need to live in the cheaper areas. As a rule if thumb the furthest you are from city center the less expensive it is. Vincennes is rather posh and expensive because it's close to Paris and there is the big park (bois de Vincennes). 
Also you should consider flat-sharing ""co-location"". 
Say you lower your rent to 300€ you could make it with the remaining 500€. Semi-random numbers here, just to make my point.
Plus you can possibly share food expenses with your room-mates.

If you have never lived on your own you should look for advice in r/frugal. Because the ""I can only afford salami baguette cucumber"" sound strange to me. If I had the choice between 3€ worth of cucumber or pasta/rice/potatoes I would rather chose the later ones.

The intent against said action is secondary. Unlawfully enter a vessel against the will of the crew, and you're a pirate. 

Please also note that maritime law is pretty straightforward against this:

&gt; Article 101
&gt;
&gt;Definition of piracy
&gt;
&gt; Piracy consists of any of the following acts:
(a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed—
(i) on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;
(ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;
(b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;
(c) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).
&gt;
&gt;Article 103
&gt;
&gt; Definition of a pirate ship or aircraft
&gt;
&gt;A ship or aircraft is considered a pirate ship or aircraft if it is intended by the persons in dominant control to be used for the purpose of committing one of the acts referred to in article 101. The same applies if the ship or aircraft has been used to commit any such act, so long as it remains under the control of the persons guilty of that act.

Ich persönlich finde, dass ihr beide richtige Sachen gesagt hab und fühle mich dadurch auch in meiner eigenen Einschätzung bestätigt.

Versteht mich nicht falsch, anfangs fand ich die PP sehr symphatisch, aber so sehr mein politisches Interesse (sprich: mein seriöses politisches Interesse) &amp; polit. Bildung voranschritt, umso mehr fand ich die Forderungen der PP sehr weit entfernt von der politischen Realität.

Das ganze Gehabe der Reformation des politischen Alltags, die Sache mit dem BGE und der Basisdemokratie. Das wurde einfach alles maßlos übertrieben.

Mir ist auch klar, dass ich wahrscheinlich jetzt von allen Piraten Symphatisanten downgevotet werde, aber von meiner Warte sollte jetzt auch einfach mal die konstruktive Kritik kommen, das ganze Auftreten und den Grad der Forderungen zu überdenken, d.h. sich selbst mäßigen.

Die PP muss sich im Klaren darüber sein, dass sie auf Dauer mit der ultra-progressiven Schiene auf Dauer keinen Erfolg haben wird.

Imho sollte die PP einfach zusehen, dass sie ihre Netzpolitik und Urheberrechtspolitik ein bisschen mäßigt, um auch andere Wählerschichten nicht zu verschrecken, noch mehr auf Bürgerrechte setzt, die Idee des BGE in den Hintergrund drängt, die Forderung des kostenlosen ÖPNV erneuert und in den vordergrund stellt und dann zusieht, dass sie mit der Idee der Basisdemokratie zurückfährt.

That is from 2011, but it's recent enough for me to hold it as relevant. A tax on smoking is a de facto tax on the poor and unemployed, who are as likely to smoke as the better off. 

&gt;Smoking is a huge burden on health services.

Have you balanced the revenue taken from tobacco taxes against healthcare expenditure? The best figures I could find are from the Irish Minister for Health, [James Reilly](http://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/19762/), in a debate from April this year.

&gt;A study commissioned by the European Union estimates that in Ireland health expenditure on treating smoking related illnesses is approximately €500 million, while approximately €170 million is lost because of absenteeism and long-term incapacity due to smoking….

But according to the Irish Government's own study (posted above),

&gt;Cigarettes are the largest contributor to excise revenue from tobacco. For example, in 2008 excise revenue from cigarettes was €1,132 million while revenue from other tobacco products (cigars and cut tobacco mainly) was €39 million.

Holding all smokers responsible for fires, of all things, is absurd. 

If anything this measure will just increase the lucrative smuggled cigarette market in Ireland, already substantial (c20% of cigarettes in Ireland were not subject to Irish duty according to the 2011 study), since the price of tobacco in Northern Ireland is so much lower.

I would support action on alcohol going down the same route as smoking but its not going to happen solely because it's political suicide. The social backbone of this country is completely dependant on alcohol and even things like minimum pricing are hugely opposed by voters.

The only research I could find on the topic of healthcare costs was a [BMJ article from the 90s](http://thorax.bmj.com/content/53/suppl_2/S38.full.pdf+html) which says smokers cause 40% added health costs but non smokers would add 6% health costs (due to longer lives), but even this article says ""it could still be seen as economically favorable under reasonable assumptions of discount rate and evaluation period"". Healthcare expense isn't the only problem, less time spent in work (and paying tax) affects healthcare funding from the other side as well. I couldn't find research looking at other costs, just [news articles](http://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/news/20130604/smokers-cost-employers-thousands-more-than-nonsmokers) and [action on smoking advice](http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_121.pdf) (this actually has an ""international studies"" section which talks about studies that conclude smokes saves money and cites evidence refuting it).

If we want people to die to save healthcare costs maybe we shouldn't enforce seatbelts or helmets or any other personal protective measures either.

Your presumptions also amuse me:

&gt; these people often want an outright ban

Let's stick to discussing what the article actually says.

Zorg voor euro’s ](http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/270751015.pdf) (PDF) 

&gt;Only a limited share of the total health care costs can be attributed to unhealthy behaviour While smoking, overweight and other determinants have a significant effect on health, disease, and care consumption, their share of the total health care costs appears to be relatively limited. The health care costs due to smoking amount to 3.7% of total care expenditure, while the figure for overweight is 2.0%. This is relatively little in comparison to the percentage costs of major disease groups such as psychological disorders 
(22%), cardiovascular disease (no less than 10%), and musculoskeletal disease (6.8%). In general, chronic conditions are the main cause of higher health care costs. To the best of our knowledge, many of these have no direct link to unhealthy behaviour or other
determinants. Cardiovascular disease (including stroke) is the most significant of those
disease groups that involve a combination of substantial expenditure and unhealthy
behaviour as a major causative factor.
Furthermore, the eradication of unhealthy behaviour results in increased health
care costs, as it causes people to live longer In the short term, the promotion of healthy behaviour leads to a fall in health care costs. The above-mentioned figures indicate that there are only limited opportunities
for making savings in the total cost of care, yet irrespective of the investments required
to achieve a healthy lifestyle.
In time, another aspect also makes an appearance. This derives from the fact that
healthy behaviour results in increased life expectancy, which means that people are at reater risk of developing diseases in later life that involve health care consumption. This involves illnesses such as dementia, psychological disorders, stroke, and conditions affecting the nervous system, such as Parkinson’s disease. Such health care consumption during the life-years gained by healthy behaviour results in additional costs that exceed the short-term savings. For the population of the Netherlands in 2003, this would mean that the complete eradication of smoking would cause the costs of
related diseases to fall by 8%, while the costs of unrelated diseases would increase by
16%. The overall result would be an increase of 12% in the total costs. The eradication
of overweight would result in an overall increase in costs of 4%

I subscribed at Finya a second time a few days ago, and found out they copied some features from OKCupid, e.g. the ""100 Fragen"" section (Edit: This feature is disappointingly not designed like OKCupid's questions. The answers are just added as text to your profile). 

Some people have profiles on both platforms, but in numbers, Finya is far ahead. As they are online for 12 years now without fees, I reckon they have their business model worked out and will not close unexpectedly. They where tested with a ""Befriedigend"" in 2011, main drawback was loose handling of personal data. Which seems logical, as they are ad-supported and probably sell user stats to market researchers.

This is what they do in Australia. 

Now again, are you proposing that Europeans should tow this boat full of refugees, that is sinking and would not make it back to any kind of land, out of European waters and then not give a shit about them? They would not make it back to North Africa.

EDIT:

So to make this EXTREMELY clear to you.

The refugees, when in European waters and spotted by an official vessel (like a coast guard or military ship) will destroy their passports and identification, and will sink their own ship. This means that the European ship has to rescue them, and once they do they are under the legal care and jurisdiction of that ship's country, where they can claim asylum. Under the UN, that country now *HAS* to process their claims. But since they no longer have passports or identification, that takes a very long time to determine their identity, or their status of being a legitimate refugee or not, during which the refugee is under the legal protection of the country that rescued them, and the refugees can choose to stay their until their application is processed.

From the RIVM Report [Zorgkosten van ongezond gedrag 
Zorg voor euro’s ](http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/270751015.pdf) (PDF) 

&gt;Only a limited share of the total health care costs can be attributed to unhealthy behaviour While smoking, overweight and other determinants have a significant effect on health, disease, and care consumption, their share of the total health care costs appears to be relatively limited. The health care costs due to smoking amount to 3.7% of total care expenditure, while the figure for overweight is 2.0%. This is relatively little in comparison to the percentage costs of major disease groups such as psychological disorders 
(22%), cardiovascular disease (no less than 10%), and musculoskeletal disease (6.8%). In general, chronic conditions are the main cause of higher health care costs. To the best of our knowledge, many of these have no direct link to unhealthy behaviour or other
determinants. Cardiovascular disease (including stroke) is the most significant of those
disease groups that involve a combination of substantial expenditure and unhealthy
behaviour as a major causative factor.
Furthermore, the eradication of unhealthy behaviour results in increased health
care costs, as it causes people to live longer In the short term, the promotion of healthy behaviour leads to a fall in health care costs. The above-mentioned figures indicate that there are only limited opportunities
for making savings in the total cost of care, yet irrespective of the investments required
to achieve a healthy lifestyle.
In time, another aspect also makes an appearance. This derives from the fact that
healthy behaviour results in increased life expectancy, which means that people are at reater risk of developing diseases in later life that involve health care consumption. This involves illnesses such as dementia, psychological disorders, stroke, and conditions affecting the nervous system, such as Parkinson’s disease. Such health care consumption during the life-years gained by healthy behaviour results in additional costs that exceed the short-term savings. For the population of the Netherlands in 2003, this would mean that the complete eradication of smoking would cause the costs of
related diseases to fall by 8%, while the costs of unrelated diseases would increase by
16%. The overall result would be an increase of 12% in the total costs. The eradication
of overweight would result in an overall increase in costs of 4%

&gt; second hand smoking doesn't kill

False. There is [a lot of evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Passive_smoking&amp;oldid=570687480#Evidence) that it does.

(Yeah, it's a Wikipedia link. Follow the references, they are solid.)

Funny. The pro-cannabis argument is always that the black market will disappear as soon as cannabis is legalized, regulated and taxed.

And they live longer because...? I'm sure that the fact that fewer and fewer people are smoking is purely coincidental.

&gt;False. 

No it's not, at least not if you hadn't clipped my comment for convenience of argument. Also, I take serious issue with passive smoking being blamed on smokers. With children, yes, it is the responsibility of the smoker to make sure they don't inhale any smoke, but with adults it is their own responsibility.

&gt;Funny. The pro-cannabis argument is always that the black market will disappear as soon as cannabis is legalized, regulated and taxed.

Perhaps you should find a pro-cannabis argument and raise your concern there? If I can buy tobacco at a quarter of the price it's sold at legally, common sense says I'll go for the cheaper option.

&gt;And they live longer because...? I'm sure that the fact that fewer and fewer people are smoking is purely coincidental.

Not sure what your point is. I was pointing out that the problem frequently cited for healthcare systems going forward will be people living longer, as in too many people will be living longer, putting a bigger strain on services.

You need to get more into the Parisian mentality of just letting time pass and enjoying it, rather than having specific plans all the time, to really enjoy Paris.

There's also tons of live music, everywhere, all the time. Go to a show at a bar or a club or a jazz venue, and just see if you like it. Drop the expectations and you'll have a lot more fun.

Main thing was that we had two referendums, one on abolishing our senate and the other on setting up a Court of Appeal on a constitutional basis.

The government wanted us to abolish the senate, arguing that it was costly, undemocratic and ineffective.  However, the anti-abolition side argued that the senate should be reformed to be more democratic and have more power, and warned against concentrating power in the lower house of parliament.  Polls generally predicted that the country would vote to abolish it, but in a surprise result the referendum actually failed and the senate is retained.

The government also wanted to establish a general Court of Appeal on a constitutional basis, the main advantage being that it would ease the caseload of the Supreme Court and reduce the amount of time it takes to have appeals heard.  There was less opposition to this referendum, and it passed by almost a 2-to-1 majority.

Wait what? Resenting *all* foreign countries is linked to resenting immigrants now? Haven't heard about that one yet. Man, even most extremist right wing parties have allies in neighbouring countries. 


&gt; It is quite common for dislike of domestic minorities to be coupled with dislike of foreigners generally. In fact, dislike of domestic minorities can be described as xenophobia (dislike of foreigners) because oftentimes the domestic minorities are disliked precisely because they are perceived as coming from elsewhere. 

My god... I don't even. Fine I'll have a go at it. You don't have to be an immigrant to be seen as strange/foreign. They are both perceived as immigrants , that's correct... I thought that was common sense. But that doesn't immediately result in a hate for their country of origin.

Meine Position ist, dass die PP in ihrer derzeitigen Verfassung *qua Architektur* dysfunktional und jede Unterstützung Ressourcenvergeudung ist, es also besser ist, sie nicht zu unterstützen, bis sie diesen Missstand aus sich heraus beseitigt hat.  Dein Standpunkt ist, dass solche Unterstützungsverweigerung im Grunde Selbstsabotage ist, und dass Erfolg sowie eine Verbesserung der Parteiarchitektur nur durch mehr Engagement in Form von Beitritten erreicht werden kann.  Wir können nicht beide Recht haben.  Allerdings ist es nichttrivial, diese Sache mit Sicherheit zu entscheiden.  Aber Du bist doch Physiker, und ihr Physiker seid doch so clever mit eurer wissenschaftlichen Methode.  Deswegen wüsste ich gerne einmal, inwieweit Deine Hypothese falsifizierbar ist. Meine wäre falsifizierbar durch die Demonstration effektiver politischer Arbeit nach einer Welle von Eintritten, messbar an steigender Zustimmung bei Umfragen und Wahlen, sich füllender Parteikasse und wachsender Zahl von Mandaten. Von meiner Warte sieht es nämlich so aus, als ob Deine Antwort stets ""Mehr Menschen müssen mitmachen/hätten mitmachen müssen!"" lautet, völlig egal, welche Probleme die Partei tatsächlich plagen.  Darüber hinaus stellt sich mir die Frage, wie viele Leute überhaupt beitreten und wie sie verteilt sein müssten, damit sich etwas bessert.  Gibt es da quantitative Schätzungen?  Oder wollt ihr den Ansatz solange fahren, bis ihr entweder euer Ziel erreicht habt oder total ausgebrannt seid?  Und woran wollt ihr Erfolg messbar¹ erkennen? Was ist euer Abbruchkriterium?  Und wie wollt ihr sicherstellen, dass es durch die neuen Beitritte nicht noch schlimmer wird?  Habt ihr eine Methode, Querulanten herauszufiltern?  Und wenn all jene, die nun beitreten, dann doch nicht auf die Parteitage kommen werden, um die Querulantenkonzentration zu senken, wird doch letztlich alles für die Katz' gewesen sein, oder nicht? 

Die Beantwortung dieser und ähnlicher, noch zu formulierender Fragen dürfte mehr noch in Deinem als in meinem Interesse liegen.

Zorg voor euro’s ](http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/270751015.pdf) (PDF) 
Is a dutch source that says the following:

&gt;Only a limited share of the total health care costs can be attributed to unhealthy behaviour While smoking, overweight and other determinants have a significant effect on health, disease, and care consumption, their share of the total health care costs appears to be relatively limited. The health care costs due to smoking amount to 3.7% of total care expenditure, while the figure for overweight is 2.0%. This is relatively little in comparison to the percentage costs of major disease groups such as psychological disorders 
(22%), cardiovascular disease (no less than 10%), and musculoskeletal disease (6.8%). In general, chronic conditions are the main cause of higher health care costs. To the best of our knowledge, many of these have no direct link to unhealthy behaviour or other
determinants. Cardiovascular disease (including stroke) is the most significant of those
disease groups that involve a combination of substantial expenditure and unhealthy
behaviour as a major causative factor.
Furthermore, the eradication of unhealthy behaviour results in increased health
care costs, as it causes people to live longer In the short term, the promotion of healthy behaviour leads to a fall in health care costs. The above-mentioned figures indicate that there are only limited opportunities
for making savings in the total cost of care, yet irrespective of the investments required
to achieve a healthy lifestyle.
In time, another aspect also makes an appearance. This derives from the fact that
healthy behaviour results in increased life expectancy, which means that people are at reater risk of developing diseases in later life that involve health care consumption. This involves illnesses such as dementia, psychological disorders, stroke, and conditions affecting the nervous system, such as Parkinson’s disease. Such health care consumption during the life-years gained by healthy behaviour results in additional costs that exceed the short-term savings. For the population of the Netherlands in 2003, this would mean that the complete eradication of smoking would cause the costs of
related diseases to fall by 8%, while the costs of unrelated diseases would increase by
16%. The overall result would be an increase of 12% in the total costs. The eradication
of overweight would result in an overall increase in costs of 4%

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Female ""circumcision"" IS female genital mutilation. See wikipedia, see the UN on it.

Yes, I've read on the matter quite extensively using primary sources and I am aware that by WHO female circumcision is called Female Genital Mutilation.

What you don't seem to be aware of is:  
Even non-invasive or purely symbolic forms of female circumcision are defined as Female Genital *Mutilation* even when there's no permanent injury to genital tissue at all. For example, would you call a ritual where someone is touched with an herb, or pinched, or scraped with a wooden stick without causing any permanent injury a mutilation? 

WHO does, which is the source for a lot of confusion about what FGM is, what it causes, and how prevalent it is worldwide. Many seem to mistakenly think that all FGM=Pharaotic circumcision which is drastic yet actually one of the least prevalent forms of it.

You claim that female circumcision leads to ""no feelings anymore, just pain. Forever."" which is incorrect. FGM varies from symbolic to some very invasive operations with removal of healthy tissue. But even the horiffic 'Pharaotic' circumcision does not lead to total loss of all feelings or sexual stimulus and such women self-report that they can experience orgasms during intercourse. 

Some forms of FGM **do lessen** the sexual stimulus. For example removing the external part of the clitoris indeed does that, yet because the clitoris is quite large and mostly *internal* organ (see the [actual anatomy of clitoris](http://blog.museumofsex.com/the-internal-clitoris/)) it does not lead to 'no feelings anymore' or total loss of sexual stimulus. And in fact such operation can even be corrected with plastic surgery because the clitoris is such large organ.

Some forms of FGM **have no effect** on sexual stimulus at all, because they cause no permanent alteration or injury to the genital tissue and no tissue is removed.

And some forms of FGM **do enhance** the sexual stimulus. For example making an incision or an excision on the clitoral hood makes the tip of the erect clitoris to protrude more outside during arousal and therefore more exposed for sexual stimulus. This is one of the most prevalent forms of FGM for example in Indonesia among with some of the non-injuring forms of FGM (for further sources see my [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nqqmn/israel_attacks_council_of_europe_move_to_restrict/cclk3ng)).

That is also the reason why this form of FGM is gaining popularity even among western women (see [hoodectomy](http://www.clitoralunhooding.com/faq-drbenson.html)). Women often choose do have it done with another quite popular form of FGM: labiaplasty, where parts of the labia is removed and which is [the third most popular procedure in the UK](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2395641/British-women-hanker-designer-vaginas-labiaplasty-sees-109-cent-rise-sought-cosmetic-surgery.html).

It's important to note that the popular FGM done to western women are done to persons who have consented and have the ability to consent to such procedures. If people want to modify or mutilate their genitals they can do it be it for health, sexual, esthetic, cultural or even religious reasons. And when such is done to a consenting person I see no human rights problem with it. 

A human rights issue arises when healthy tissue is removed without a medical reason (treatment) from a person who *does not or even cannot consent* e.g. children, infants. That does break the relevant human rights conventions in Europe.

Such as:  
The UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, articles 12, and 24 (3) which say that children should have the right to express their own views and must be protected from traditional rituals that may be harmful to their health.

The Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine which bans removing living tissue from a person who cannot consent: ""No organ or tissue removal may be carried out on a person who does not have the capacity to consent under Article 5.""

That applies also to boys. Boys are not excluded from the human rights. The same conventions protect their right to their bodily integrity just as well as girls.

Children's right to physical integrity, and consent and the ability to consent are at the heart of the issue.  

OP is about the European Council's resolution which says:  
*""The Parliamentary Assembly is particularly worried about a category of violation of the physical integrity of children, which supporters of the procedures tend to present as beneficial to the children themselves despite clear evidence to the contrary. This includes, amongst others, female genital mutilation, the circumcision of young boys for religious reasons, early childhood medical interventions in the case of intersexual children and the submission to or coercion of children into piercings, tattoos or plastic surgery.""* (resolution available here: [Children’s right to physical integrity](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/511200/20131003/male-circumcision-muslim-jewish-condemned-european-council.htm))

And then this:
&gt; Male circumcision: Everything keeps on working fine.

Except when doesn't. 

We do know that male circumcision does have inherent risks of complications even when done in clinical settings. Those include: infection, necrosis, gangrene, BXO, urinary tract infection, urinary retention, meatal ulceration or stenosis, urethral fistula, hypospadias or epispadias, lymphedema, loss of penis or even death.

Transparency programme not getting shafted. Government published a proposal in a public consultation. An article suggested that there could be a difference between the publication of a government body decision and the time this decision would become valid. Some people think that this would also allow a decision to become valid before being published online. The text is not finalised and the consultation is still open.

PM and Greek government did not compare Nazis with Eurosceptics. What PM says is that there are many extreme views in the country, from different groups. This is the typical knee-jerk reaction from the leftist opposition and the new populist media associated with it. No one can make anything ""disappear"" in this day and age.

Discussions about the next tranche are always paused and restarted because this is the nature of negotiations everywhere. It doesn't really matter now because the next tranche is small. Not to mention that it is crazy to see people against the loans raising this matter.

Former rectors and the majority of students and parents are against the decision, say that current rectors play political games with the opposition. Opposition tries to create an Autumn of Discontent in order to gain popularity, as 2013 is the last year of recession and Greece's economy will start growing again.

In effect, Naurgul writes what the party newspaper of the opposition publishes. He is also noted for doing the same in /r/greece. Anyone should have this in mind when reading his comments.

First post I see... doesn't seem very meaningful really? Some article saying ""teach your children not to rape"". Fair enough. Seems pretty biased against boys, but the concept (you should be clear what consent is and isn't) is unobjectionable. And people who say it's implying boys are born to rape are missing the point. It isn't. The problem is that somehow a lot of people end up having horrible notions of when rape is justifiable or when consent is implied and the only way to fight that is to teach people otherwise, I suppose.

Second one is being silly and moaning that someone said Diabetes is to fat people as AIDS is to gay people. Of course it's not literally the same but I don't see anything wrong that observation and they're not claiming in that post that it really is, it's just making a silly musing.

Third, well, you may have a point. But I'm never sure which side to believe on these kinds of things. Both ""sides"" (I'm upset there even are any) are highly incentivized to side with particular participants based on gender, unfortunately. You can bet that there are also MRAs all over it as well who are just as ridiculous.

Fourth is someone getting mad at a Mexican because they thought they were being racist.

Once you decide to go to the Cinque Terre you basically end up in Genoa (one way or another). There is no quick way out of this area. After going Florence &gt; Pisa &gt; La Spezia up to the 5 Cinque Terre towns you will be hard pressed to justify this slow trip south again.

So basically, cross Venice off......unless you want to make a huge arc over Italy and waste like 5 hours doing it.

If you want to do the Cinque Terre cheaply.....there are cheap lodging options in Pisa and Genoa. This includes hostels.

Well, that is your definition, and you are fairly alone with it. It seems the rest of the world are not agreeing with you. Of course, you can call those people whatever you like, but I'd advise you to at least call them economical refugees, because they are not refugees other than under your definition. I mean, if you want to be alone with using a word, fine with me, but I do not even see the sense of that. 

&gt;Even though both Spain and Greece are experiencing economic difficulty right now they are still some of the most successful and rich nations on the globe.

You do not seem to have read the definition of a what a refugee is. The people from example Tunisia or Algeria who are trying to make it to Europe, are not being prosecuted. That is actually a definition of refugee, that you have to be prosecuted for something outside your control, like ethnicity or religion. A definition of a refugee is *not* someone who wants to make more money, no matter that they are poorer than the European average.  So, from the definition you use, someone who wants to go somewhere else and make more money - then yes, Swedes are refugees too. I think the term is ridiculous of course, and would never use it on neither Swedes or Greeks, but I do not call the people coming across the Mediterranian that either. I call them migrants, people who want to migrate for economical reasons. Understandably, certainly, but it does not make you a refugee. 

Rich people can be refugees for example, which they can not be under your definition. Think of rich Kambodjans who fled the Khmer Rogue (granted, not a lot of them got away) or Chileans who were against Pinochet. Or, from our own continent, just wealthy Jews trying to get out of Europe during WWII. Certainly refugees, but not fleeing for the economical reason you are citing. (and yes, I know that the Geneva definition of refugee didn't exist  until after WWII).

I mean, if you want to be alone with using a word, fine with me, but I do not even see the sense of that. 

Calling them anything but refugees makes it seem as if their situation isn't critical or desperate. 

&gt;You do not seem to have read the definition of a what a refugee is. The people from example Tunisia or Algeria who are trying to make it to Europe, are not being prosecuted. That is actually a definition of refugee, that you have to be prosecuted for something outside your control, like ethnicity or religion. A definition of a refugee is not someone who wants to make more money, no matter that they are poorer than the European average. 

I think you're making the mistake of comparing what these people did to conventional immigration. They don't want to make more money, they want the things that you, and everyone else in Europe and North America for that matter, take for granted: clean water, clean food and security. I'm not saying we should encourage africans to come to Europe but when they do we shouldn't do everything in our power to expell them for wanting nothing more than to live a better life. 

&gt;So, from the definition you use, someone who wants to go somewhere else and make more money - then yes, Swedes are refugees too.

When was the last time Swedes were displaced due to war or genocide? When was the last time a Swede died because he didn't have access to clean water or food? These situations are not comparable.

&gt;Rich people can be refugees for example, which they can not be under your definition.

Again, feel free to do that, but please, understand that the UN do not agree with you, they do not classify the immigrants as refugees under the Geneva convention.

Again, what does that has to do with anything? I am not the one defining refugess, the Geneva convention is. You seem to have a really hard time grasping that. Again,the Geneva convention is.

Your definition which I am admitting is a bit unclear since you seem to dislike stuff like laws and the Geneva convention, which defines refugees. You seem to think that the whole world should disregard the Geneva convention and take your definition to heart and follow it. That is actually what you are arguing about now, your definition is better and above the Geneva convention. I think that is hybris.

Face it - these people are not refugees. That fact that *you* want to call them that, doesn't make them that. I can call them Martians or Japanese but that doesn't make them that. The fact that you seem not to like the Geneva convention, doesn't make them more refugees. I you want to make them that, become a politician and change the convention.

Mit einem veggie day nimmt man dir quantitative Freiheit. Darin ist sich wohl jeder einig.

Allerdings öffnet man mit einer Förderung eines Veggie Days die Gesellschaft hin zu etwas Neuem. Das würde einfach neue Chancen auftun - in dem Sinne einer Öffnung zum vegetarischen Essen. (Und das sagt jetzt ein Nicht-Vegetrarier der schon oft von Vegetariern/Veganern ge- und entnervt wurde)

Das ist eben das, was der Autor unter Liberaler Chancenpolitik und dem progressiven Aspekt versteht -vorrausgesetzt man gewinnt Vegetarismus einen progressiven Aspekt ab-.

Das sind jetzt alles natürlich sehr abstrakte und theoretische Gedanken, das muss ich auch sagen, aber der zweite Teil des Artikels über den humanistischen Liberalismus erklärt doch ganz gut die Sichtweise des Autors und diese Theorie.

Ich persönlich kann dazu nur so viel sagen, dass ich -was jetzt nur den veggie day betrifft- dem theoretischen eigentlich folgen kann, allerdings denke ich, dass die Komplexität der Theorie in der Realität vielleicht ihren Anspruch verliert, bzw die Theorie von ihrem Anspruch einbüsst.

true,WhiteGradSchoolMale,null,null,"&gt; Sarei curioso di sapere qual'è la percentuale di reddito che un italiano devolve realmente allo stato.

Do per scontato che intendi la percentuale del reddito lordo. Pensavo di riuscire a trovare rapidamente uno studio ma il mio google-fu mi sta venendo meno, quindi mentre approfondisco ti rispondo con un calcolo spannometrico. Ovviamente parleremo di valori medi.

L'OCSE stima che il cuneo fiscale sia al 45%. Questo significa che del reddito lordo complessivo che un'azienda potrebbe corrisponderti se tasse e contributi fossero nulli, il 45% se ne va in tasse e contributi (a carico tuo o dell'impresa). Quindi, per un lavoratore dipendente il reddito netto è circa il 55% del reddito lordo.

Da qui deduciamo che se anche solo il 10% del tuo reddito netto finisce in ulteriori tasse (IVA, accise, service tax, imposte comunali), la percentuale del tuo reddito lordo che se ne va in tasse supera il 50%.

Ecco, io non ho ancora i numeri per poterlo affermare ma mi sembra abbastanza plausibile che più del 10% del reddito netto di un lavoratore dipendente finisca in tasse, quindi che più del 50% del reddito lordo se ne vada nelle casse dello stato (in una forma o in un'altra).

I thought they had calculated the total costs associated to treating smokers for smoking-related conditions. But after reading here:

&gt; This is relatively little in comparison to the percentage costs of major disease groups such as psychological disorders (22%), cardiovascular disease (no less than 10%), and musculoskeletal disease (6.8%).

It appears the above figure excludes conditions that, while related to smoking (among other things), are not solely caused by it. If this is the case though, this isn't the relevant figure: if, for example, smoking increases a chance of cardiovascular disease by 5%, then the costs associated to treating the 5% additional cardiovascular conditions should be listed under smoking-related costs. Is this what is done in the study, or is it different?

The last one here though is an interesting point that is rarely brought up:

&gt; Such health care consumption during the life-years gained by healthy behaviour results in additional costs that exceed the short-term savings.

Eradicating unhealthy behaviors could end up raising healthcare costs by enabling people to live longer and thus live into those later years when many costly conditions crop up.

Parisians aren't any more rude than people of any other large city, they just have different customs/ways of interacting than those people from smaller towns or cities.  Also they deal with loads of tourists so I can see where that gets annoying sometimes.

I actually never really even thought I wanted to go to France.  Then the opportunity presented itself and I jumped on it.  I knew next to no French when I signed up.  So I studied up.  I know I butchered the shit out of it.  And I felt stupid as hell saying it... but I greeted everyone in French and began every conversation with French.  Not once was I met with a rude reply.  The majority of people weren't just overly friendly, but they were nice.  Don't expect random conversations with strangers.  I had a few people attempt to correct my French, but it was always done with a smile and they would congratulate me when I got it right (or close enough) then continue the conversation in English.

Natürlich ist beim Angebot auch viel Schrott-Füllmaterial dabei: Low budget, Direct-to-DVD Filme usw.

Watchever ""funktioniert"" auf PC und PS3 sowie tablets, AppleTV usw. Das ist auch ein Plus.

Die Nachteile: Die Software macht keinen sehr ausgereiften Eindruck. Hängt sich auf der PS3 gern mal auf, oder bleibt beim Ladebildschirm hängen... Es gibt keine Fehlermeldungen, man weiß nie, was los ist, wenn mal was nicht geht.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"You should visit London. While you are there, you should go to Dennis Sever's house.  It re-creates rooms from various historical periods (18th century onward, I believe).  The idea is that the occupants of each room left it just before you arrived.  The sounds, sights, and even smells are simulated.  Talking and phone use are not allowed. 

This review sums it up well, but it does make three mistakes.  First, while you can go through the house's rooms in any order, you are supposed to start with the basement.  Next, while the ground floor is the home of a wealthy family, the top floor isn't.  Finally, while it might be wise to book in advance, and the house might have special events that require a reservation, I just showed up during its hours of operation and got to walk through the place without a reservation.  It wasn't very crowded, either.

On a related topic, you should definitely check the British Museum's website to see if it has any special exhibits that you want to see.  Getting a ticket for one of those requires calling weeks or even months in advance.

-begin review-

""Easily my favorite site of all the museums, oddities and nooks I obsessively explored while I was in London.

""This house is a time capsule, sometimes opened up. To enter its door is to pass through a frame into a painting: one with a time and a life of its own.""

As the web site explains, the house's creator, Dennis Severs, spent many years trying to recapture, through painstaking effort and detail, the lifestyle of a family living in the 1700s in London. The product of his efforts is Dennis Severs House, and it is captivating.

Why spoil the mystery by revealing details here, though? The idea is that this house is a unique experience for each visitor - it captures your imagination and your senses (including smell!) and will leave specific interpretations up to you.

You wander from room to room, perhaps starting in the basement and making your way up several levels, and the whole time you feel as though you are a visitor (an intruder, rather) in a house that is being inhabited by a wealthy, busy family in the 18th century.

It truly does take you away. I remember being jolted back to reality when I found myself on the outside doorstep afterward, thrust back into the cold, damp streets of 21st century London. It's almost a lonely feeling, and you suddenly rush to commit to memory every image you've just taken in.

But enough blabbing from me! Go see it for yourself. I was fortunate enough to get a ticket during Christmastime, when the house was appropriately decorated, but it will no doubt be unforgettable regardless of the time of year. To reserve your spot, go to the web site, click ""bookings and visiting,"" and send an email.

When I have kids one day, I can't wait to take them here and experience it all over again with them.

&gt; A ban on councils giving social housing to individuals with no connection to an area, with “penalties” if the rules are not followed

It depends how this is implemented, but I support the general principle. Social housing need to be thought of as a community resource, that people support because their family or friends may need it in future. i.e. something which is direct, local and practical. You're making a decision now which will decide what will happen in 20 or 50 years, and people aren't going to give a damn if twenty years down the line someone can move in from the other part of the country (perhaps where all the housing has been sold off) and reap the benefit.

Effectivement, le plus simple serait de déménager. 

Maintenant pour répondre plus précisément aux questions :

Problème dans les parties communes : comme dit auparavant, c'est le syndic qui s'occupe de tout ça, après accord avec les copropriétaires. 
Et un syndic, c'est pas rapide. Dans ma copropriété, quand on a eu un problème de lumière (ampoule grillée) généralement ce sont les proprio qui siègent au conseil syndical qui changent les ampoules (en plus ça évite des frais). 

Franchement, 1 mois de délai, ça ne me choque pas plus que ça. 

La boîte aux lettres : il faut qu'un propriétaire se plaigne et demande l'installation de casiers / boîte aux lettres. Sa demande sera relayée lors de l'assemblée générale de copropriété et soumise au vote des copropriétaires. Si ils sont rapias, ne compte pas trop dessus

Le reste, c'est à voir avec ton agence si c'est elle qui te loue l'appartement ou avec le propriétaire. 

Pour ce qui est des stores/rideaux, il va te rire au nez. Il n'a aucune obligation à ce niveau. Par contre si tu veux installer une tringle et donc percer le mur, tu dois le prévenir. 

L'isolation de la porte ça va être difficile à faire passer, surtout si c'est juste une question d'isolation et si la porte ferme correctement tout de même.

Pick one, and just one. Two if the cities are really close (like a few hour train-ride close), or if you are really bored quickly.

Here's why: Your first day or two, you're going to be jetlagged to all hell and you're just going to be a zombie. Then you're going to be rushing to see everything you possibly can in each city, and you're not going to enjoy much of it since you'll be in a constant rush. You're not really going to absorb the essence of the city/country. You're not going to get the nuance that each of them has. And each trip to another city is basically a whole day lost to logistics.
 
If you pick one, you'll see all the touristy crap off the bat, and then afterwards you can see the stuff that most tourists miss or that aren't as well known. Some historic church or building, or even just some natural features nearby. After a few days you start to notice the cultural differences between you and everyone else since you're not in a rush and you can actually observe things. Take a day or two and just make no other plan than wander around the city.

Oh, and your biggest bonus is that it ends up much cheaper since your logistics are simple.

Seriously. The whole quantity over quality thing is shit. You're going to be exhausted and all you'll have for it is pictures of the same stuff that's in every tour book everywhere.

If you're thinking of ancient Britons, the people who built Stonehenge etc? Then English, Welsh and Scottish people are all largely descended from ancient Britons. Who, by the by, didn't speak Welsh, and weren't celts.

If you're thinking of celtic Britons, the people that lived in Britain when the Romans invaded, then.. guess what..? English, Welsh and Scottish people are all descended from them.

The only meaningful difference between English people and Welsh people is ""when / to what degree have the people forgotten their Brythonic language"". I'm sorry if this comes as a surprise to you; the nationalistic mass simplifications of British history into distinct English, Scottish and Welsh parts that are popularly understood just don't hold up when you get down to the detail. In fact, examined in a modern context, they sound uncomfortably like racism.

I don't know my Scottish history so well, but I presume the same is true of Scottish people, who like the English would have spoken a Brythonic language before the various incursions from Ireland and the Nordic countries; and, like England, ends up as a mish-mash of different cultures.

To answer you original question, if I've understood the subtext...

i) Not just the English are the ""enemy"" - it really is the British. There were many, many Welsh and Scottish people who settled in Ireland. I don't know the proportions, but I believe the settlement was largely from the geographicically proximate areas.

ii) The IRA, however, specifically attacks England. I'm not sure why this is, given the links between Scotland and the Orange Order, but I presume its because attacks in Mainland Britain were often intended to disrupt the economy and garner attention. That meant attacking the big cities; London, Manchester, Birmingham etc. I'm not aware of any attacks in Wales, but I'm not sure that, say, Kent, or Yorkshire, was targetted either.",0,1381126394,null,0,1381128237,0,ccmmehc,t3_1nvjyx,t1_ccmmehc,t1_ccmgzao,null,1429218252,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Here: From the RIVM Report [Zorgkosten van ongezond gedrag 
Zorg voor euro’s ](http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/270751015.pdf) (PDF) 
Is a dutch source that says the following:

&gt;Only a limited share of the total health care costs can be attributed to unhealthy behaviour While smoking, overweight and other determinants have a significant effect on health, disease, and care consumption, their share of the total health care costs appears to be relatively limited. The health care costs due to smoking amount to 3.7% of total care expenditure, while the figure for overweight is 2.0%. This is relatively little in comparison to the percentage costs of major disease groups such as psychological disorders 
(22%), cardiovascular disease (no less than 10%), and musculoskeletal disease (6.8%). In general, chronic conditions are the main cause of higher health care costs. To the best of our knowledge, many of these have no direct link to unhealthy behaviour or other
determinants. Cardiovascular disease (including stroke) is the most significant of those
disease groups that involve a combination of substantial expenditure and unhealthy
behaviour as a major causative factor.
Furthermore, the eradication of unhealthy behaviour results in increased health
care costs, as it causes people to live longer In the short term, the promotion of healthy behaviour leads to a fall in health care costs. The above-mentioned figures indicate that there are only limited opportunities
for making savings in the total cost of care, yet irrespective of the investments required
to achieve a healthy lifestyle.
In time, another aspect also makes an appearance. This derives from the fact that
healthy behaviour results in increased life expectancy, which means that people are at reater risk of developing diseases in later life that involve health care consumption. This involves illnesses such as dementia, psychological disorders, stroke, and conditions affecting the nervous system, such as Parkinson’s disease. Such health care consumption during the life-years gained by healthy behaviour results in additional costs that exceed the short-term savings. For the population of the Netherlands in 2003, this would mean that the complete eradication of smoking would cause the costs of
related diseases to fall by 8%, while the costs of unrelated diseases would increase by
16%. The overall result would be an increase of 12% in the total costs. The eradication
of overweight would result in an overall increase in costs of 4%

Je m'avance certainement, mais au vu de leur site, j'imagine tres bien le scénario type suivant : 

Un jour velorution appelle ses sympathisants a se rassembler quelque part dans paris. 
Plusieurs dizaines de vélos se pointent, et partent tous ensemble, au mépris des règles élémentaires de ""savoir-rouler"" sur la route, dans paris (circulation de front, ralentissement de la circulation etc ... )

Bref, ils font chier le monde, mais dans *la bienveillance, la tolerance et la non violence*. 
 
Bref, ils se sont certainement frotté aux flics qui ont utilisé des methodes musclées pour régler le problème. 

Ca ne fait jamais plaisir. 

Mais bon, c'est un peu ce qui s'est passé avec l'arrestation de Nicolas B. de la manif pour tous, et franchement j'ai trouvé ca normal  ... 

Donc, oui, messieurs-dames de velorution, nous vivons en société, avec des règles, notamment la déclaration du parcours en préfécture.  Comme dirait eolas (que je n'écoute que lorsqu'il parle de droit, pas quand il fait de la politique) : *Une simple déclaration, qui se fait en mairie 3 jours francs avant la date prévue (à Paris à la préfecture de police), pas une demande d’autorisation.* 

Maintenant, c'est clair que c'est difficile de declarer un rassemblement. 
Et puis, surtout je crois, ca ne fait pas très revolutionnaire. 

Allez, ce n'est pas moi qui va pleurer sur votre sort, bien que j'aime faire du velib a Paris :)

That's inconsistent. If migration is a solution, then we should send planes to go get all poor people and bring them here. What you advocate now is to ignore the problems until they show up on your doorstep and you can't keep a clear conscience anymore. A more consistent position is this: migration is not a solution to economic disparity and shouldn't be considered a right; anyone attempting it is kindly reminded of this fact and sent back home.

Rather than showering money to keep bad debtors breathing, the EU authorities could finance early-retirement programmes for civil servants in peripheral countries, subject to substantial deregulation and privatisation in key areas, including the labour market and state pension schemes.

Oh wow, the classic right-wing bait-and-switch. In the name of efficiency and prosperity we will cut down on the public sector, reduce workers' rights and privatize state welfare. Notice how the hook is about removing ""regulation, red tape and taxation"" but the actual interventions affect NONE of those except in the labor market.

Fuck that noise. If you feign scandal because filing your taxes requires stamps from 7 different offices you propose to change the law and make it so it needs only one stamp (and you can get it online). If instead you propose that we put a few thousand public sector workers in early retirement, privatize a few programs and deregulate the labor market, while mentioning literally nothing about those 7 stamps, it's petty clear that the motto playing in your head is ""state bad, private good, state bad, private good"".

The fact of the matter remains that the healthiest countries in Europe also have extensive *public* welfare programs and great workers' protection; oftentimes and especially after the economic meltdown their public programs and labor laws are actually *more* extensive than their counterparts in financially unhealthy countries.

Sadly, most of that money is instantly gone because I need 70 euros/month for my Navigo pass and I've already spent more than $2000 just getting over here between my flight costs &amp; the cost of all the paperwork I had to do, which I need to pay back (I borrowed from a family member).

To pay this back, I'm trying to break that $2000+ down into the following 12 months, so that's an added cost of ~ $200/month (~150 euros). 

Essentially, what this works out to is that I have to pay (70 +150 =) 220 euros/month for the Navigo pass &amp; for fees I've already paid, leaving me ~100 euros/month for anything I need in France.

Actually, we can't, and I'm amazed how you could come up with such flawed reasoning. If they were desperate enough to embark on a barge alongside a hundred other people just to escape their country we can safely say their situation was pretty terrible. 

&gt;That's great. I want an income of a million euros. Should I migrate to the house of some billionaire?

The situation is not comparable. 

&gt;That's inconsistent. If migration is a solution, then we should send planes to go get all poor people and bring them here. 

It would be good if we could do that. Unfortunately, we can't, but what we can do is help those who seek help. 

&gt;What you advocate now is to ignore the problems until they show up on your doorstep and you can't keep a clear conscience anymore. 

I'm not saying we should ignore this problem, more should be done to help the countries these people are running away from. 

&gt;A more consistent position is this: migration is not a solution to economic disparity and shouldn't be considered a right; anyone attempting it is kindly reminded of this fact and sent back home.

&gt;I don't care. Really, I don't. Freedom is more important.

If we went with this inane philosophy we wouldn't have a ozone layer anymore. The ban on CFC gases is the perfect example of how individual agents are unable to come together to cause coordinated action and how corporate interest will subvert the truth even to the detriment of all humanity. And the idea that freedom is being able to ingest whatever you want shows that you do not know what freedom is.

I am not sure what you are referring to here. Are you saying that there is a genocide going on in Africa that the UN are not aware of, and have not named, that the people on the boat were fleeing from, but *you* are aware of? Could you then please post links and scientific evidence of it? Furthermore, I think the UN classified the genocide in Ruwanda as genocide. Are you saying they didn't? Or are you saying because the world didn't get the involved, *your* definition is above and above the Geneva convention? 


Can you post evidence, legal and scientific, to online journals and recources why *you* are above the UN and the law, and are smarter and better, and *your* definition is above legal experts. I honestly don't think anyone who has the slightest expertise with Human Rights Law would use the silly arguments you are.

&gt;That term cannot be applied to people trying to escape living conditions on par with what was the norm in Europe five hundred years ago. 

Norms change. 500 years ago, as in 1513 capital punishment was also a norm and a lot of words have changed definition since then, among them refugee. You are clearly grasping at straws now. 


&gt;Were there no refugees before the Geneva Convention? 

What does that has to do  with anything? Again, you can call people what they like, but you have no evidence for it. You call them refugees, but they are not. I can call them Martians, but they are not. 

You obviously can't handle to loose an argument on the Internet, and apart from your aparent hybris (*your* definition is above UN and the Geneva convention) I suspect you are one of those persons who justs has to have the last word, no matter how silly your argument is, or how wrong you are. It is clearly evident in the way you argue, you have attacked everything from my nationality (which obviously has nothing to do with the Geneva convention or the UN) to trying to bring up hisorical arguments that does not matter one bit in todays world. 

The fact is that you are wrong, and you can't handle it. Those people are *not* refugees, and you know it. The fact that you are trying to argue that you are more important, know more and are above the UN and the Geneva convention, frankly, it makes you rather pathetic. 

I guess I'll get another post from you, since you just have to have the last word, but both you and I know you are wrong. Try to admit it every now and then, it will not kill you. Say - ""those people are not refugees, but I feel sorry for them nevertherless, it is never fun being poor"".


Haha, whom am I kidding. You would never do that. You have posted that your definition is above the UN and the Geneva convention, you'd never, ever admit the fact that your definition is not the correct one.

If they would put the effort and money they made to migrate into digging wells, they would have clean water.

Are you saying that there is a genocide going on in Africa that the UN are not aware of, and have not named, that the people on the boat were fleeing from, but you are aware of? Could you then please post links and scientific evidence of it? Furthermore, I think the UN classified the genocide in Ruwanda as genocide. Are you saying they didn't? Or are you saying because the world didn't get the involved, your definition is above and above the Geneva convention? 

The Rwandan Genocide is a text book example of the uselessness of the UN as an organisation.

&gt;Norms change. 500 years ago, as in 1513 capital punishment was also a norm and a lot of words have changed definition since then, among them refugee. You are clearly grasping at straws now. 

So there were no refugees before the Geneva Convention, is that what you're saying?

&gt;What does that has to do with anything? Again, you can call people what they like, but you have no evidence for it. You call them refugees, but they are not. I can call them Martians, but they are not. 

The definition of refugee is as follows: ""a person who flees for refuge or safety, especially to a foreign country, as in time of political upheaval, war, etc. "" 

""a person who has fled from some danger or problem, esp political persecution""

How exactly are people leaving a country due to deplorable living conditions not reefugees? Hell, the first thing you'll be told if you want to visit Africa is not to. Apparently, it's dangerous for us to go there but not dangerous for the people who live there. 

&gt;You obviously can't handle to loose an argument on the Internet, and apart from your aparent hybris (your definition is above UN and the Geneva convention) I suspect you are one of those persons who justs has to have the last word, no matter how silly your argument is, or how wrong you are. 

Please tell me exactly where I have provided an altered definition of what a refugee is. 

&gt; It is clearly evident in the way you argue, you have attacked everything from my nationality (which obviously has nothing to do with the Geneva convention or the UN) to trying to bring up hisorical arguments that does not matter one bit in todays world. 

Feel free to quote the post where I have attacked your nationality.

&gt;I guess I'll get another post from you, since you just have to have the last word, but both you and I know you are wrong. Try to admit it every now and then, it will not kill you. Say - ""those people are not refugees, but I feel sorry for them nevertherless, it is never fun being poor"".

There is more to this than simply ""being poor"". By European standards, not affording a big screen TV or a smartphone is considered phone. These people don't even have access to clean water. 

&gt;Haha, whom am I kidding. You would never do that. You have posted that your definition is above the UN and the Geneva convention, you'd never, ever admit the fact that your definition is not the correct one. 

I'm a going to ask you again: where have I provided an altered definition for what a refugee is?

I'm not the kind of person that believes that the italian food is the only good food around, but i'm proud of italian culture.
In the end i appreciate both italian and foreign food, but i'm not a taliban: if ""goulash"" tastes better than &lt;other italian dish&gt;, it tastes better. ""Patriotism"" is about being proud of your country, not about being haughty (France, i'm talking about you ಠ_ಠ).
[on a side note: when i see someone cooking an italian recipe with ""some change"" to make it ""more italian"" (""lasagne"" with ricotta, mozzarella and garlic) well, that makes me cringe]

If I were the OP, I would use Les Echos instead ( http://www.lesechos.fr/economie-politique/france/index.php ). Maybe less coverage but they tend to stay more focused on giving the information and less on making it palatable to their audience. They don't really care for the fake left/right divide that is characteristic of French politics,  and explains why for instance our Green party is more a leftist party than an ecology party or why you will never have the PS speak with our center parties which are rather close to them ideologically and will instead try to broker completely useless deals with the communist one that they have nothing in common with. 

So even newspaper like Le Monde have to make it clear which side they're siding with and it is often at the expense of politically balanced description of events whereas Les Echos don't have that much of a necessity for bias since it deals mainly with people interested in the economy and the repercussion of political events on it.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;The Rwandan Genocide is a text book example of the uselessness of the UN as an organisation.

So, the fact that *you* (again, this is all about you) find them useless doesn't change the definition of what a refugee is. I don't find them useless. Again, it is all about you, you, you.

I've asked you to post links - why can't you do that? Are you afraid? Don't you have any? Post the links of the genocide they are missing now that they migrants are fleeing from? Why can't you do that? Are you denying the Geneva convention? 

If your definition is the right one - post links to your extremely high credibility then. You must be one hell of a famous Human Rights Judge, since you apparently know more, and have a better legal definition than the UN and the Geneva convention. I am looking forward to you proving that the Geneva convention is incorrect.


&gt;    matter one bit in todays world.

Feel free to quote the post where I have attacked your nationality.

You asked the last time Swedes were the vicitims of genocide for example. It clearly has no bearing on the case whatsoever, but was a useless attack on my credibility. 

&gt;The definition of refugee is as follows: ""a person who flees for refuge or safety, especially to a foreign country, as in time of political upheaval, war, etc

Not according to the Geneva convention. That was *again* your definition. If you want the world to accept *your* definition, above the Geneva convention, post proof that you are the legal mastermind of the world. I am waiting, but you seem not to have anything. 


&gt;I'm a going to ask you again: where have I provided an altered definition for what a refugee is?

All the time. You refuse to accept the definition in the Geneva convention and that the UN classifies people.  If you accepted the definition in the Geneva convention, we would not be having this argument. The UN do not classify those people fleeing across the Mediterranian as refugees, nor are they. 

Basically, you are saying, without any evidence of course, ""I am right, the UN and Geneva convention is wrong"". So, *post* evidence of it then. If you *are* right, there must be evidence of it. 

&gt;So there were no refugees before the Geneva Convention, is that what you're saying?

No. What I am saying is that the Geneva convention gave us a clear definiton of what a refugee is.It has been signed by almost every country in the world and used for decades, yet you seem to think that you are above it. 

&gt;There is more to this than simply ""being poor"". By European standards, not affording a big screen TV or a smartphone is considered phone. These people don't even have access to clean water. 

You are making stuff up. You have no idea if that is the case or not. Besides, being poor does still not make you a refugee in the Geneva convention. 


&gt;How exactly are people leaving a country due to deplorable living conditions not reefugees? Hell, the first thing you'll be told if you want to visit Africa is not to. Apparently, it's dangerous for us to go there but not dangerous for the people who live there.

Now you are lying and making stuff up, again. My cousin lives in Africa, in one of the regions people migrates from btw, and I am going to another part of Africa this winter. I am not being told not to go? You are just lying sometimes, I wish you would stop doing that. 

Since you seem to be arguing ten things at once, I'll thought I'll make it simple for you. Answer this.


**The question is - are the people coming across the Mediterran refugees according to the Geneva convention? Yes or no? ** 

Both you and I know that you want to call them refugees, and you can keep doing that. You call them refugees, I'll call them Martians for the future. That is the glory of the freedom of speech. But, you have to admit, according to the legal definition that both our countries, and all countries (ok, maybe not Israel) around the Mediterranian has signed, the migrants are *not* refugees. Then you can keep on calling them that, and I'll call them Martians. Are you happy now?

But they can get one if they mean you harm.

&gt; When they expect to meet armed resistance, they just take hostages or make sure they shoot first. And since they're initiating the violence, they have the advantage: it happens on their terms.

So are they cowards who run away at the first sign of some defenceless person present, or do they take hostages and shoot first?  Make your mind up.  They're at extreme ends of states of aggression.  And on the wrong ends too.  In reality, criminals confronted by armed resistance will leg it.  Criminals who encounter defenceless people are emboldened by the fact that they have power over the defenceless person, the elderly are particularly vulnerable prey for these lowlifes.  Also, people who commit armed robbery get significantly harsher sentences than unarmed robbery.  Both of those factors combined are why US states with low gun regulation have the lowest instances of burglary.
