Joke aside - make a budget. Include everything you use at least once a month and then start to cut and skip. However, I would not recommend to cut back on nutrition, rather try different ways of getting your food (i.e. working in a restaurant gets you to the kitchen. Free meals and leftovers). 

Also, a GA is a splendid way to combine commuting and travelling. I spent almost all my holidays between 16-21 in Switzerland, travelling with my GA, a bike (even rollerblades do the trick) and a tent. This way it also gets you across the border to Austria, Germany, Italy or France.

Accommodation will be a big chunk of your budget as well. As you will have a GA, look for something out of town. You could even rent your own small flat on the countryside for as low as 500.--.
