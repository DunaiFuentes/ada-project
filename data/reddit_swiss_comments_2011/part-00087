true,fondueguy,null,null,"Hey, sorry it took my so long to get back. I forgot about this post then I remembered.

My guess is that quote had to do with the idea of men providing for and protecting women, and women choosing the ones who gave them the most. There is an argument that women are inherently more valuable, in a biological sense, because a womb is more rare than sperm; ie it only takes a few men to impregnate many women so each man can be replaced more easily than each woman. Because of this imbalance men had to do more to start a family. Men had to earn their value while women already had their value. (Feminism talks as if a marriage is about making money, but if a marriage is actually about starting a family then it is clear that the ""provider"" is a service and not a privilege). This has resulted in men exploring, building, competing, conquering (things that shaped civilization) and women getting their pick of what... Shopping.

An alternative explanation is that, in modern times, women have been picking and choosing their rights and responsibilities. Women want the vote but not the draft. Women want the choice of working but they aren't willing to let the man be the stay at home parent. Women want the choice of parenthood after conception (abortion and even early adoption) but still want to force men into parenthood after their unilateral decision to go through with birth. And so on.

But ya, that list is incredible. I'm a little iffy on whether on not megazen.should have included that one quote. The other stuff is so solid and that quote really only makes sense to those who already understand what he/she is saying...

Since most spots ""in the alps"" are in the 1.5 - 2 hours driving range, I wouldn't know what she meant by that either. However, as you see, a day trip is worth it for checking out the freshly snowed over Swiss alps. 

About New Year's: You have two major public spots: The lake or the ""Polyterrasse"", the terrace in front of the polytechnic institute, which is a little more elevated compared to the rest of town, therefore offering a better view onto the fireworks, but confined and therefore a little more prone to crowding. Also, it's not that close to the main crowd: on the B체rkliplatz. If we choose to watch the fireworks there, we make sure to stay a little off the docks, towards the end of Bahnhofstrasse, as the view's the same and the crowding is really moderate. Other than that a really festive and cheery atmosphere is prevalent. 

Hope you're having fun!

When we planned the trip we mostly just planned for Basel and Zurich, but after we'd booked hotels and such she then threw in this desire to ""visit the alps"", whatever that means.
