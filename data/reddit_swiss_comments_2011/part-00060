* The government has no control over the monetary policy of the SNB. 

* We have an export-driven economy. Exports make up more than half of the Swiss GDP. A 1.20 floor is the absolute minimum to prevent export-oriented companies from immediately moving abroad/going bankrupt.

* I don't care at all about foreign investors. The assumption that the CHF is a safe haven got us into this mess. 

* I don't mind that the banks will have to scale down a bit. They will have less money to pump in the next bubble and are less likely to bankrupt the country.
