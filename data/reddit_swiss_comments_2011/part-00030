That would be great! Tell you what - I'll heed your advice and only request one night with you (the day that I arrive; June 30), then I'll be out of your hair and take one day in Lausanne/Montreux or Interlaken the next day.

Do you mind if I get your address/phone number so that I can call/meet you on the 30th?

Send me a request on CS, I have all the info for my place saved there as a template.

Interlaken itself is rather dull (a tourist resort) but there are loads to explore around. Search those on google images for some epic tourismgams: Lauterbrunnen, Grindelwald, Rosenlaui gorge, Truemmelbach Faelle, Ballenberg, and last but not least, Jungfraujoch.

All those are pretty cheap and easy to access from Interlaken, except Jungfraujoch that is ridiculously expensive (about 160$ I think, but the view is absolutely amazing and it's worth to do once in your life).

Around Montreux, you can see the Chillon Castle, and the view of the lake with the mountains behind worth the trip too.
