true,Commander_Adama,sz,Schwyz,"If you are in the Interlaken area then Grindelwald is probably one of your top destinations. In May it will still be a bit brisk, but not cold, perhaps between 5 and 15 degrees Celsius. There won't be any snow at that height, but of course the mountains will still be covered.

[Here](http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/interests/hiking1/top-hikes.html?region=007) are some of the most beautiful trails in the Berner Oberland, however, it says that the seasons are July/June to October, so I'm not sure if they are closed before that, or if that is just a recommendation. The way the hiking trails are written in Switzerland though, on the yellow sign posts, makes it very easy to find a nice trail. It will show you the destination and the estimated time like [this.](http://www.wandern.ch/fileadmin/wandern/Bilder/Medienbilder_allgemein/_c__Schweizer_Wanderwege_Emmenuferweg.JPG)

true,shadowman131,null,null,"Thanks!  Yeah, Switzerland is one part of our trip from Portugal to Sweden, so we can't really move it back further into the Summer unfortunately.  But 5-15 degrees doesn't sound too bad, just have to check the trail closures I suppose.

Snow on the mountains but not much below would probably be very scenic!",0,1300868113,null,0,false,0,c1lxgg3,t3_g9hd8,t1_c1lxgg3,t1_c1lxaee,1427006188,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
true,[deleted],null,null,"There will still be lots of snow on top of the mountains. But in Interlaken you can't say: On first of May it still could be pretty cold, but it could already be warm. Best thing is you come with an open mind and are prepared to change your plans.
A beautiful hike is to Kleine Scheidegg. You start in Grindelwald, go up to Kleine Scheidegg and then down to Wengen. Okay, it's a pretty long walk (6-8 hours), but you are always walking near the railroads, so whenever you need a lift you just take the train. Plus: this track is very safe, even if you have never hiked in the alps you would feel safe.
A favorite with the Swiss is also the Schynige Platte: It's a high plateau you can easily reach by train and mountain railway from Interlaken with lots of hikes. For some reason the summer there starts earlier than in most parts of the alps so you have a good chance to see some mountain flowers.",0,1300873126,null,0,false,0,c1lxldy,t3_g9hd8,t1_c1lxldy,t3_g9hd8,1427006252,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

It's a big detour, but one of the most beautiful trips in the Switzerland. If you have time (it takes almost a day to go from Zermatt to Chur and then to Zurich), you definitely should take it: http://www.glacierexpress.ch/
As for Zurich: Well, there is so much to do...

true,zachv,null,null,"Went to Zermatt for a weekend in January with work. I don't remember the names of any of the places we ate, but everything was amazing. I was quite surprised that it didn't disappoint, after all the hype it has.

In Zurich, there's a little route I take whenever I take someone there for the first time. It's more intended to give a nice little overview of the town for a tourist or someone who don't have tons of time.

I start at the train station, then take the PolyBahn up to the ETH/University Zurich and go to the look out. From there we meander down the hill and down the river and eventually make it to the Grossmünster (big church).  

Next, I like to take the short-trip with a boat around the lake (kleine Rundfahrt). After we're done with that, take a stroll up the Bahnhofstrasse.

Also, the Swiss National Museum (located behind the train station, sort of) is sort of neat, if you're into that kind of thing. 

I'm sure other people have better suggestions, but that's my 2 cents right there. I don't live there, so I don't know all of the ins and outs of the city, but that's maybe a start.",0,1300999456,null,0,false,0,c1m63eb,t3_g7ora,t1_c1m63eb,t3_g7ora,1427010611,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
