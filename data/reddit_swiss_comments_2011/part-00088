true,futurespice,zh,Zürich,"I'd definitely recommend Luzern over Bern if you only have time for one side-trip - sorry Berner friends :)
If you had more time and the season was different a trip to Lauterbrünnen would be good (2.5 hours or so from Zurich by train) but right now the snow might get in the way.

For fireworks on the 1st a place I have found nice in the past is the Zollikerberg in Zurich but it may be difficult to get to for tourists. Beware: they are rather disappointing; the big pyrotechnics are normally on the 1st of August.",0,1324899102,null,0,false,0,c3b9l8e,t3_nqjyr,t1_c3b9l8e,t1_c3b5lhy,1428077311,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

But in one point I have to disagree, there is no official, organised firework in Zurich on the 1st of August, only at Zürifäscht  and New Year's eve, which are quite impressive if it's nod cloudy or foggy. ;)",0,1324902271,null,0,false,0,c3b9q55,t3_nqjyr,t1_c3b9q55,t1_c3b9l8e,1428077369,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
