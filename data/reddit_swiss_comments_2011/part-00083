true,djacobson86,usa,USA,"Hey there.  American also living in Switzerland now.  I would say that it is very important, especially if you are a doctor, to have a moderate amount of French or Swiss German(depending on which part of Switzerland you would come to).  I know a couple of doctors here(French part of Switzerland) and it sounds like they are speaking only French in the hospital.  The second thing to consider would be the compensation.  For a doctor in Switzerland at your level you will earn probably CHF 50,000 if you are just out of Medical School and then after 2-3 years this will bump up to CHF 70,000.  This is not a lot of money for Switzerland and the doctors I know are certainly not living lives of luxury.  I guess this would probably be about 1/2 of what you would earn in the US as a doctor.  Just want to make sure you understand those things.  Besides that, Switzerland is a great place -very high standard of living, lots of beautiful sites, and lots of great people.",0,1323500200,null,0,false,0,c36shrm,t3_n4vq7,t1_c36shrm,t3_n4vq7,1427999763,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

true,anyone-but-me,bs,Basel-Stadt,"Why thank you :) I actually went over this in my head again last night and if you're ever in Basel you should definitely go to the Tinguely museum (http://www.tinguely.ch/en.html)! It's such a unique experience and great fun :) Also if you don't mind walking around in the cold winter air the Zoo is a nice place to spend an afternoon. And as futurespice mentioned the art gallery is just fantastic. In addition to that there's tons of great independent galleries and museums (such as the paper museum (http://www.papiermuseum.ch/en/the-museum/) and the cartoon museum (http://www.cartoonmuseum.ch/index.cfm/3E3A33F7-1C23-4C99-AFE5AF048ADC7F1C/?&amp;lang=en)) I'm afraid I can't tell you much more on what Zurich has to offer as I'm not too familiar with it myself, but as I said before, it just depends what kind of person you are. If you like to drink and go out clubbing then Zurich is your better option, but if you prefer a nice walk along the Rhine after some quality sightseeing then Basel is the place for you. (Not to mention the fact that if you'd like, you can get to both France and Germany with ridiculous ease!)
