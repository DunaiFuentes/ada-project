Hmm, I've only lived here less than a year, so I haven't found too much to do yet. It's a tiny little town (at least compared to where I used to live, ha ha). 

My hubby and I did venture over to St. Gallen twice this past year. First time we were looking for a phone for me that was sold out everywhere (didn't find it in St. Gallen either unfortunately) and the second time we went out to dinner at this American BBQ style type of restaurant. We got lost on the way back. My hubby blames the GPS but I know better ;) ",0,1302894082,null,0,false,0,c1plrgf,t3_exsz6,t1_c1plrgf,t1_c1ploov,1427070177,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
