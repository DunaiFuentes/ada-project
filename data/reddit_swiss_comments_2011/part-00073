true,futurespice,zh,ZÃ¼rich,"1. Why does it have to be an American plane we are taking about?
2. During WW2 the Swiss airforce both shot down a few American planes and forced others to land in Switzerland.
3. It would be quite hard for the US to invade Switzerland on flimsy grounds like being forced to land.

I have little sympathy towards the army but this guy is just trying to score a political point, not reason.

true,canteloupy,vd,Vaud,"I don't think you got where he was going.

He mentioned American planes because it is them who lately have been flying over our airspace without authorisation. Moreover, it is likely that any other plane flying over Swiss airspace would be an ally rather than an enemy given our position in the middle of Europe and the EU surrounds us.

The point is that if they argue we need to spend billions on new planes and raise the army spending, they should be able to tell us what the point is. Since there is no current threat and the only people who are going to violate our airspace are people we would never initiate retaliation against, it's purely to sustain weapons manufacturers and an army for its own sake rather than for any kind of actual purpose.

I think it was a very smart way to expose the current hypocrisy in defense spending.",0,1321206193,null,0,false,0,c2zgd6n,t3_mamg0,t1_c2zgd6n,t1_c2zfobi,1427871926,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
