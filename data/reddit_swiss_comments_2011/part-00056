Second, if you want to buy just a case, mobo, CPU and RAM, and you're planning to add the HDDs, graphics card, etc by yourself... why don't you just buy the parts and assemble them?

true,Wakers,null,null,"You earned the downvote.  Crappy attitude in the post and you assumed I hadn't looked just because I didn't mention it in the text? What sort of crappy reasoning is that?  Is that just your low opinion of people coming through?

I'm looking for the bundles because they tend to be good value for money, they come pre-assembled (CPU cooler included) and tested and have an extra warranty on top.  It works out well because over the hundreds of computers that I've built, the components most likely to be RMA'd are RAM, CPU, Motherboard in that order.

The idea is to then buy the case and everything else and build the rest of it.  In the UK you can do that and not add anything extra onto the price (maybe £10 or so).

Doesn't seem possible in CH though, sadly.  Neither in Germany apart from a custom seller on Amazon.de, which won't ship to Switzerland anyway.",0,1316610939,null,0,false,0,c2lhb5f,t3_kmndk,t1_c2lhb5f,t1_c2lhabi,1427627946,-3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,-3

I'd say free speech doesn't give you the right to put anything you want on someone else's billboard without his approval, so this can't be considered as censorship, even if sbb is doing this for political reasons (which would be very surprising).

I wouldn't mind if they would forbid all advertising.
