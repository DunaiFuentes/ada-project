Switzerland was finally industrialized during the 70ies (yes, that late, think about it) and all other nations that have a standard this high had much longer to adapt socially. Most define themselves about their work, not about what they love to be (US after '68 for a short time) or what they think others expect them to be (China, e.g.); this is a classical protestant ethic: If god loves you, your successful, if not, your broke.

There is also no time left to think about yourself in other parts of the world when you are undergoing the hormonal shift during the late teens.

Right off the bat I would tell you if you can make it happen without starving or living on the street(which you wouldn't be with 100k) I would say go to Geneva.  It's such an incredible life experience not to mention an international stint is basically like putting gold on your resume.  You'll have plenty more opportunities to build your bank account. 

Now as for the cost of living, yes, Geneva and all of Switzerland is really freaking expensive.  You also have to remember that you are a US citizen(i'm assuming here) and all of that is taxable income in the US.  I don't know your whole situation but suffice it to say that you probably need to keep that in mind as it can be a substantial amount of money sometimes. This is why alot of US companies sending expats overseas have a tax equalization policy, so their expats don't have to worry about it.   

You also need to take into account a few other things like buying/leasing a car.  I would highly suggest if you are living in Geneva to not buy a car(alot of people don't).  The public transport is so easy and efficient here that you don't need one.  If you do need a car every now and then, just join one of the car sharing groups, like mobility.   So, that's probably a good 400-750/ month that you will save over Philly.  

Your groceries and dining budget should be about double what you would have in the US.     Same thing applies for going out.   Drink prices are about 1.5-2x higher than you would see in NYC, Chicago, etc.

So, all in all, yes, you'll be able to get by but probably won't be able to put as much into savings as you would in Philly.  However, you will not have as satisfying of a life and professional experience. I promise you.   Send me a PM if you have any more specific questions.
