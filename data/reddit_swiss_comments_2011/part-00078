The Swiss can speak standard German, of course, but the fact that you won't be able to follow conversations between them really diminishes your ability to learn the language. I studied abroad in Basel without fully understanding how Swiss German is basically another language altogether and it took me a long time to adjust. If I hadn't come in with a high level of German and tried to learn the language organically, I wouldn't have been able to use that language anywhere outside of Switzerland except maybe on the border with Germany or Austria.
