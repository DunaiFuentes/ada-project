UBS and Credit Suisse are among the worlds biggest banks. They are part of the 147 transnational corporations who in theory can control the rest of the global economy and shape policy. They too are were officially labeled 'too big to fail' and bailed out. Which in other words means they are too dangerous to exist. They too pay astronomical bonuses to their managerial elite.

Those bailouts were never voted upon democratically.

People who say only those who are suffering can legitimately protest and all others are effectively hypocrites make me sick. Actually those people who are economically powerful have a real chance of effecting change when they go protesting - not the 'have nots'. Pretty logical isn't it? 

Protesting is a form of raising awareness, of getting representation of a differing viewpoint in the media, of showing solidarity and breaking isolation. Thus a way to help change a broken system.
