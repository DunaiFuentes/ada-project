You can also look into the Glacier Express (again, good weather is important) for an amazing trip through the Alps.  Ticino has a lot of cool places as well (Lugano, Bellinzona, Locarno).  Luzern would be another great day trip from Bern, you can go up to Mt. Pilatus and/or take a boat trip down the lake.

....by the way, it's probably worth it for you to get a 1/2 price card (""halbtax""... for, as you can guess, half price on all buses/trains in Switzerland)... and you can also consider a month unlimited pass on top of that if you are going to be really, really using the trains/buses a lot for that two weeks...

The Jungfraujoch mountain is amazing, you can get up there by train and have a view on the biggest glacier of Europe, truly breathtaking. It's pretty expensive to get up there, but if you can afford it, it's definitively worths it once in your life (and if you have a train pass you'll save a lot).

Other stuff to do / see in Switzerland: Chillon castle, Gruyères village and the Giger museum, Tinguely museum in Basel, take the glacier express train through the alps, go to an awesome open air music festival or rave in the moutains (there are loads in summer), climb some other mountains if you don't make it up the Jungfraujoch, have a barbecue by a lake and swim, go camping somewhere...
