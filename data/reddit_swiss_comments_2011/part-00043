To look for a job you can go to the RAV but try the job search platforms too, they are innumerable but here is one to get you started:

Zürich is probably the most forgiving city when it comes to knowing little german as long as your english is good. Bern will probably be harder as we have less international megacorporations and more national companies/government institutions. On the other hand, all that depends on what kind of job you are looking for.
