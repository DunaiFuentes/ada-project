true,grtaser,null,null,"I don't have a problem when regular citizens are doing security work for a company, because it's absolutely clear that they have the same rights as everyone else, no matter what kind of uniform they are wearing. 

As soon as these boundaries are overstepped and we're starting to grant them additional rights, the distinction between police and private security firms is getting smaller and i'm starting to get worried. 

There are three main problems. The integrity of the people who are working at these jobs, the lack of oversight, and the corporate structure of the companies providing these services. The companies themselves are huge and making tons of money, the security sector has seen a huge growth in recent years. The leading figures in that business have connections to politics, police and defense, the prime example being securitas, quasi owner of securitrans. 

In the end it's about private companies getting multi-million contracts from the government, getting quasi-police power for their employees doing the work that police should be doing, while their bosses are in bed with politicians and government figures. Do not want. 

There is an interesting article about securitas [here](http://www.multiwatch.ch/cm_data/Beobachter_Juli08.pdf) (in german, pdf).",0,1317391433,null,0,false,0,c2nry84,t3_kwf9g,t1_c2nry84,t3_kwf9g,1427667696,7,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,7
