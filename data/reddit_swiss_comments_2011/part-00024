FCSG. I am dissapoint. 

Here the current points and next (last) two games.

Xamax: 31
(Xamax-YB) (Sion-Xamax)

FCSG: 30
(FCSG-Basel) (YB-FCSG)

Bellinzona: 29
(Thun-Bellinzona) (Bellinzona-GC)

So FCSG probably won't make more than 1 point in the next two matches. They can only hope Bellinzona doesn't make more than 1 point. FCSG has a better ""goal difference"" than Bellinzona so if in the end they both have 30 points FCSG will probably play in the ""Barrage"" (relegation?).",0,1305455328,null,0,false,0,c1u5qcr,t3_hb8zc,t1_c1u5qcr,t3_hb8zc,1427149049,1,false,SanktGallen,t5_2s9fb,1
