If you're looking for an English Pub, there's the Oliver Twist in the old-town (which is known as Niederdörfli), Paddy Reilly's Irish Pub near the Bahnhofsstrasse, the Big Ben Pub, near the station ""Hardbrücke"", and the quite popular Nelson's near the Mainstation. There's a good chance you run into some English folks in all those places.

As in going clubbing, the place most crowded with bars and clubs is probably around ""Hardbrücke"". You've got great bars like the Akt4, lounges (try Basilico), cinemas and lot's of clubs (To name a few: Escherwyss, Club Q, Hive, Supermarket, Härterei). In choosing which one to go, you should just check their website and decide what kind of music you're up to. But be aware that prices are fucking ridiculous. A club entry costs you around 25.- CHF and when you're in, a drink's  around 15.- 

The Niederdörfli is great to just hang around, moving from bar to bar and just have a relaxed atmosphere.

As for food, you have to try a ""Zürcher Geschäntzels"", as it's our speciality, and a Fondue speaks for itself. 

I don't really know anything about cheap accommodation as I'm living here, but I guess you could check out some couchsurfers sites. 
There are no laws that come to my mind that would be special to an American, except maybe that you shouldn't be building minarets in your free time ;) If  you're a smoker, it has become normal to only be allowed to smoke outside of every establishment.

You can use sbb.ch to check travel distances and costs.  I think for 500chf you can get a half-price card (valid for a year) and a one-month unlimited travel card (you have to first have the half-price card to be allowed to buy the one-month unlimited pass), for all of Switzerland.  Might be worth considering if you want to explore the country a lot.

The public transport in Switzerland is excellent, so for day trips you can reach a lot of places within 1-3 hours each direction... even though there isn't much in the ""immediate"" area around Bad Zurzach.  Anyway, if you go a bit further, some ideas to start with are Luzern, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen/Rhine Falls/Stein am Rhein (same area), or for an overnight/weekend trip, perhaps Lausanne and that area, or Ticino (Bellinzona/Lugano/etc).   There are endless beautiful places in the mountains throughout the Alps (even if most people only go to the Interlaken area).

For bars/clubs, you can find anything in Zurich (going out is extremely expensive, though).

I think hostels are the cheapest way to go, be sure to book ahead in the summer (hostelworld.com), especially for weekends I bet they fill up pretty quickly.  Otherwise, couch surfing is a possibility (you can google it).

For foods, anything cheese-related.  Not the ideal season, but you should still try Fondue and/or Raclette.  Any grocery store has a huge variety of good chocolates.  There are many good Swiss wines around... unfortunately, I can't say the same for the beer (imported beers are often cheaper and better).

Otherwise, I don't think there will be any big surprises.  Don't make too much noise late at night or any time on Sunday and your neighbors will be happy. Recycle everything.

true,OnlyOnePairOfShoes,null,null,"&gt; What foods should I be sure to try? 

In no particular order: Bratwurst with a ""Bürli"" at the ""vordere Sternen"" at the Belevue, Züri-Gschentzelts mit Rösti at Kronenhalle (or if this is too expenisve (which it will be ;) ) anywhere, all the chees stuff (Fondue, Raclette), Cordonbleue with French Fries at the Aargauerhof at the Langstrasse, Asian/ Thai food at the AhHua at the Helvetiaplatz, Potatoesalad and a ""Wienerli"" at the Werdinsel.



&gt;Are there any bars or clubs that I should be sure to visit? 

That depends on your taste in music. If you like the electronic variety visit one of the (free) after hours outdoors (at the lakeside at the GZ Wollishofen or at the riverside at the ""oberer Letten"", since there is nothing better than sun, nice music and happy people. Or try the Cabaret !! or Fridas Büxe (although the prices are ridiculous). Or, if you are lucky at the Hubertus!. If rock'n roll is more your thing, there is the Abart, the Moods, Helsinki and several other places with concerts almost every weekend. Try to stay away from places like the Q or Supermarket, Bahnhofstrasse and Niederdorf (maybe for a one hour visit, but not longer ;) )



&gt;Are hostels the best play to stay while traveling or are there cheaper or free places I can spend the night? 

There is a youth hostel in Zürich, and there are some bedandbreakfasts. The prices per night will be around 80.- CHF which is fragging expensive. If you just want to go out one night you won't need an place to stay at all since the clubs stay open till early in the morning (normaly around 8 am). 



&gt;Also, are there any laws that I should be aware of? 

Not really, except, you are allowed to drink at the age of 18, prostitution is almost everywhere legal (and there is a increasingly disgusting street prostitution scene establishing),you are only alowed to smoke in ""special rooms"" so called fumoirs, and sometimes we swiss people behave like douches. But then , who does not??



&gt;Anything that an American wouldn't expect (a level headed American)?

The thing about prostitution, Marihuana is not that illegal as it is in the US (generaly drugs, there are Heroin distribution projects in Zürich where heavy users get their drug from the state (not only methadone but also heroin) Loads of bank employees in Zürich, Switzerland is very diverse (If you find the time, go to the region of Graubünden, in the alps.

It's a nice little place. Make sure to check out the Thermalbad while you are there. It's a little pricy but go at the weekend and make a day of it. 
There's also the Regibad down near the river. It's a lot cheaper and more youth oriented. 

Since you are going to PSI the best way of getting to work is thus: 

1 - Get a Halb-tax card and the Gleis 7. 250CHF total, lasts a year. Trust me you WILL SAVE THE MONEY. 

2 - Get a monthly ticket from Bad Zurzach to PSI Ost. 

Then the journey itself:

3 - Train from Bad Zurzach to Döttingen 

4 - Then there is a bus that goes from there to Brugg. That bus goes to PSI which has two stops. 

The train takes about 15 minutes then another 15 or so on the bus. 

After work a nice place to go is Waldshut in Germany. It's a nice old town with some great restaurants. 
To get there just get the train home as normal but get off at Koblenz. From there it's just one stop over the Rhine into Germany. 

There is also a Lidl just next to the station in Waldshut so we tended to go there for food shopping since it was quite a bit cheaper than the alternatives in Bad Zurzach (Migros, Coop and Denner. Denner isn't too expensive but it's a small shop).

You can also walk from Bad Zurzach over the Rhine into Rheinheim which is much smaller than Waldshut but also has an Aldi. 

Bad Zurzach itself is a bit of a way from Zurich HB (the main station). To get there you need to get the InterRegio service that goes to Brugg and get off at Baden. Then you switch to the S27 line which goes to Bad Zurzach. Those trains are every 60 minutes but you can also get a train to Koblenz and switch. Essentially this means you can get a train every 30 minutes to Bad Zurzach from Baden.

Baden is a nice place too with some bigger shops (like H&amp;M and other high street brands) and the Freibad is great fun on a nice day. 

Switzerland is a fantastic place and I highly recommend that, if you are not already aware of IAESTE Switzerland you look them up and attend the events they put on.

What I can recommend for chilling out in summer additionally is the area around Gessnerallee close to the river Sihl.

It's also not too far away from the Langstrasse where you have more bars and clubs (usually the cheaper ones). However the Langstrasse is also the place where most junkies, prostitutes and other poor people live. So this is not a wholehearted recommendation.

Also worth mentioning is the Swiss shyness, that is very much different from the American (superficial) openness. People will rarely approach you and the Swiss are easily startled when you approach them, but that's just the first few seconds. After that people are very friendly, but a little distant.
