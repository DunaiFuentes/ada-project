I beg to differ, it's MUCH better, although you pay a lot for it through insurance. Nevertheless... The hospitals here are incredible, medicine in Switzerland is very modern as a whole. 

That said I do agree with the pharmacies, most of the pharmacists in Switzerland don't seem to have much medical/chemical or scientific background and their liking for homeopathic medicine is ridiculous. The main thing I miss is being able to buy medicine in supermarkets. Most of them just seem to be store clerks, the pharmacists I know in elsewhere round the world have bio-med / bio-chem backgrounds.

But I think that it is part of a culture difference (particularly the leftist green influence) that encourages homeopathics over pharmaceuticals. Which I also find quite odd considering the big Pharma based out of CH.

true,Thoroughbred_Of_Sin,null,null,"I've worked in a call center in Switzerland, I'm not proud of it. I was a student and needed the money. However, that awful job provided me with some good insight on how to get rid of telemarketers. Although unlisting your number might get the number of calls slightly reduced, you can't get rid of them that way. A lot of those companies randomly generate the numbers. That means they pick the districts they plan on calling that day (for example 044 for Zürich) and let a computer add the rest of the number.

Also, do not hang up the phone. Whenever someone just hangs up, or yells something like ""no"", the number automatically goes back to the pool of numbers and they'll call you again in a few days or weeks. They just hope to catch another family member next time or have better luck with you on another day. 

A good idea is to say that the person they are looking for has died. Or that you are not the owner of that house/apartment, that they have moved away or are on a prolonged stay abroad (at least half a year). Also pretending not to speak German, French or Italian is a really good idea, just make it known that all family member (this is important) speak nothing else but Swahili. This probably has the biggest success rate. If they can't communicate with you, they will put you on a list of numbers in their system that they won't ever call again. Same goes for pretending that your hearing is really bad.

But whatever you do, please don't be rude to the people calling. They are just people who have to work there because they need the money, no one does it because they enjoy bothering people. Just keep in mind that no one wants to be called a bitch and a faggot all day long (yes that's what it's like).

A couple of weeks ago I talked to a young Russian woman, an immigrant from Siberia currently married to a Swiss guy she met 7 years ago. I asked her opinion about such nationalistic rhetoric and whether she felt offended by it...To my horror, she said: ""I'm not offended at all. In fact, I support it. I'm conservative. We do need to stop immigration"". ""But you're an immigrant yourself, right?"" - ""So?"" - ""So, if you could vote, you'd vote...against yourself and folks like you?"" - ""Yes, I would vote against myself. I'm against immigrants"". 
I asked her to elaborate on her position. She reasoned that immigrants are ""all anarchists"" who defy the very concept of allegiance and loyalty to the state (""they already betrayed their home country, they can easily do it again with the host country but in a different form like criminal activity and disrespect for traditions""). 
That was an interesting discussion...
She - a recent immigrant, no Swiss passport yet - really is conservative on a ton of issues besides immigration. In fact, she seems much more conservative than ANY Swiss I know. So is the whole Russian diaspora here (at least, according to their forums and newspapers)...I wonder why...
(btw, something similar I observed in NY where the Russian diaspora consistently votes Republican)

Iran is a theocracy. When Michelle, head of state of Switzerland, visits Iran, citizens expect her to represent them, their nation and their values.

* There are 4 official languages which are spoken in Switzerland: (Swiss-)German, French, Italian and Retoromanian. In the north and most part of the east most people speak Swissgerman, in the west French is the main language, in the South Italian, Only a small part of the east speaks Retoromanic (I don't even know how the name itself translates to English). In bigger cities and tourist places you won't have any problems communicating in English because almost every time someone can speak a little bit of English. In the more rural areas it can be quite hard to get along with English but there are always possibilities (and as I said, at tourist attractions you will always find someone who speaks a little bit of English).
* I would recommend to use Swiss Francs. Most tourist places and the bigger stores in cities will accept Euros, but you will get a bad exchange rate and the change will be in Swiss Francs.
* Marijuana is illegal. The social acceptance depends on the place you are. In Zurich I've smoked on the streets, in backyards or in the park and nobody complained. In Basel there were some guys who even smoked a J in a club. But in general I wouldn't recommend to smoke in public because problems with the police can be a hassle, especially if you're here on vacation.
* The guys I've spoken with always complained that most of the bars only sell Lager. I personally like some beers from smaller Swiss breweries so I think it will be the best idea to ask the locals which beer they would recommend.
* I think there are two or three places with enough snow to have some open slopes, but I don't know if they're any good (I think Zermatt is open during the whole year).
* There are a few posts on this topic so I will leave this question open for the other guys/your own research.
