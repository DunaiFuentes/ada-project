true,canteloupy,vd,Vaud,"50% of the emissions we're responsible for are ""grey emissions"" that are not taken into accounts. This is mostly because 50% of the energy use we are responsible for is grey energy. This is not due to regulations, but probably to the fact that we mostly get our revenue from tertiary sector activities, industrial activities having been delocalized mostly during the last century, which has cause heavy effects on our economy in some regions. We do not have much heavy industry any more in Switzerland.

Our policies about water pollution came about after our Basel chemical industry was able to get rich and produce polluting chemicals to do this, after which they delocalized production and we were able to keep less polluting activities in the mainland and avoid polluting waterways. There are interesting studies involving the regulation of water pollution and the capacity of Switzerland to put laws into place after we benefited from polluting activities getting revenue.

As a green party member in Switzerland, I would encourage you to become critical in your approach of our glowing record. Our cars pollute less because we are rich consumers so our whole car park is very new, but it also means that these are heavier cars, especially with the 4WD fashion, which is heavily co-opted by our upper middle class. Even so, we do have strict regulation regarding air pollution with mandatory controls for your car every so often, which are the condition for being allowed to drive it.

One place we are quite good at is house isolation. When building a new house or renovating any building, there are strict regulations as to the energy efficiency of the construction. In addition, the rate of people living in apartment buildings in some regions is high, even though the overwhelming majority of new construction is individual houses.

We also do attempt to use rail and public transport, even though despite our good infrastructure the rate of car use is very very high. Large amounts of money go into our public transportation and there is no stigma associated to taking it. Our ministers use it to go to work, for instance.

In addition, we have good recycling rates, and in the German-speaking part of Switzerland there is a garbage bag tax, which is a huge incentive (for instance in Z端rich) to recycle everything from compost to glass to aluminium to paper, etc, with very comprehensive systems for all of this allowing people to easily do it.

Now this is just off the top of my head. I don't know for now what effects all of this truly has on the environment. I am part of a movement struggling for higher standards, still, and better integrated activities, for instance we have interesting things we start to do with one industry working with the waste of another nearby industry, but it is at the embryo stage. The two biggest things we should work on in my opinion is energy efficiency for buildings, and urban planning to reduce incentives to build houses in farm land at the periphery then go to work every day in a car. I think our advantage is that given the relative wealth of the country we are able to put into place strict regulation without affecting the overall economic tissue too much. Grey energy and emissions is also a huge part of our responsibility that is hard to tackle. We don't make the iPhones here, nor do we make the steel that our cars are made of nor the industrial materials for the building of our energy efficient houses, etc, but we consume much of it.",0,1321609867,null,0,false,0,c30sbm6,t3_mga11,t1_c30sbm6,t3_mga11,1427895001,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5
true,YouLikaDaJuice,null,null,"I'm not terribly farmiliar with big peices of legislation and industrial regulation here in Switzerland, but I can tell you that a big part of our environmetal health is little things.  Here is one anecdotal example:

Unlike in the US, when you put out your trash for collection here, the bag must be of proper dimensions and weight, and must have a sticker on it.  These stickers must be purchased, and thus the more you throw away, the more you spend.  Boxes and other product packaging take up alot of space, and people didn't want to waste money filling up garbage bags with packaging so people started taking their products out of excessive packaging at the store, and throwing it away there (think of a toothpaste tube in a superfluous cardboard box).  Well the stores didn't eppreciate having their customers filling up their garbage cans and dumpsters with all this disgarded packaging, so they told the manufacturers to stop using excessive packaging materials.  

Voila, this waste was cut off at the source by popular demand in the interest of frugality.  

That being said, there are also many controls here that don't really exist in the US.  For instance, many homes are wood heated, and these ashes may be analized to determine if you have been burning dangerous or polluting agents.  The same is true of waste water.  

Also relative to the US, recycling inferstructure is pretty aweful here.  Of the Reduce and Reuse Recycle triangle, the Swiss have the reduce and reuse figured out.  Waste of food for instance is simply not socially acceptable the way it is in the US. But the recycling inferstructure in Switzerland is god aweful, and in many places completely non-existant.  

Also affordable and efficient public transit coupled with expensive driving.

And a large proportion of renewable or semi-renewable energy sources.

And more than anything else.  People here are educated enough to give a shit.  People here actually make decisions based on social responsibility rather than only with their wallet.  For instance, many Swiss will spend the extra money to get organic, fair-trade, or local food even though they could go Germany and buy it for a third the price.
