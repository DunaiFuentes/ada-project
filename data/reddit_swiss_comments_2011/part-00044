Minarets have been blocked for quite some time now so in a way it wasn't forbidden but it was near impossible to get one built. At least the issue went official in all it's xenophobic aspects.

Note that when the vote passed, there where protests in the streets and not just Muslims.

This was sadly the majority's will. Some populist right-wing party's helped by the banking money had a big campaign and passed the silly law after popular vote. Not much to discuss when each had the chance to say and act.

If you look at a chart of Switzerland for this vote as well as other populists votes, overlay a population density map over that and you'll notice the more rural, isolated States lead in saying ""yes (ban)"" whereas the big cities tend more towards ""no (don't ban)"".

- I agree with you that culture and values do make a difference. BUT:
- While it can't be denied that the Swiss mentality has been shaped strongly by its Christian history and protestant ethics, the founding ideology of the successful modern Swiss state is not Christianity, but rather secular, democratic liberalism. That, to me, is the fundamental Swiss value that the resounding success of our country has been built upon.
- Although I am not a religious person myself, I believe that restrictions of religious rights stands in direct opposition to these fundamentally Swiss values and thus hurts our nation in the long run. I also believe that the minaret ban is detrimental to our long-held national value of neutrality. In other words: By banning minarets, we have started to abandon our fundamental values of freedom and liberalism in order to protect our fundamental values of freedom and liberalism.
- I do agree that religious fundamentalism is harmful to these values; but that applies to fundamentalism within any religion. Evangelical fundamentalists can be just as dangerous as islamic fundamentalists. My problem with the minaret ban is that it singles out just one religion, ignoring the fact that the lion's share of muslims in Switzerland consists of peaceful, law-abiding, reasonable citizens. In the long term, there is a risk that this specific rejection of one particular religion may actually serve to increase radicalisation of muslims.
- I don't believe that the mere presence of a one-digit number of small towers serves to significantly advertise the existence of islam. The SVP's massive poster campaign has most likely done much more to make people aware of islam than minarets have ever done.
- And finally, I believe that the emotional style in which the SVP has lead this debate stands in complete opposition to the successful and important Swiss tradition of reasonable, factual, levelheaded political discussion -- a tradition that has contributed significantly to our democracy and our nation's success. I consider this initiative to be a populist move that has a lot more to do with strengthening the SVP's influence on public opinion than with protecting Switzerland's identity.

In summary: I respect your opinion and your right to vote in whichever way you think is right. But to me, Switzerland's fundamental values are liberalism, secularism and level-headed, reasonable debate. I therefore see this initiative as a dangerous attack on our core national values. That is why I voted no.

My reasoning for not voting no was that I feel there really are issues out there and no one takes them on. (SVP actually realized this and it does take them on, but in such a ludicrous populistic way that I could not vote for them either.) Under no circumstances did I want SP to feel like they're doing everything right, which in my personal opinion, they absolutely don't. In my humble opinion, the left is ignoring and ridiculing the people's concerns and I do not know why. As a consequence, I feel not represented by the left and will not vote for them.

Now back to the mosques: To be perfectly honest, I do not want any. I feel like as a people we have finally come to a point where our average christians have evolved and are not really that religous anymore. And now there seems to be a whole new batch of really religous people from islamic countries and the whole process starts again. Arrgh.

I would like to point out one thing, though. Everybody's talking about islamic fundamentalists... but where are they? Practically all muslims I've come across in this country seem to be just as passively religious as most christians. And even in the few cases I've come across where people are deeply religious, their children are generally not. I know, I know, anecdotal evidence and all that... But still, for all the talking, nobody -- even hardcore SVP proponents -- has been able to point out any real signs of significant fundamentalist activity to me.

This whole thing is about the impression the citizens get. It's about the direction in which the western countries are headed. It's about if the people feel represented by their leaders.
Let me give you a few examples that might help you appreciate why, in my personal opinion, the SVP is winning initiative after initiative and will continue to do so:

* The girl with the headscarf that took the basketball liga to court because she wasn't allowed to play while wearing it. (Allthough in this case she actually lost, this was a huge wtf moment for the average citizen.)
* All the bullshit about kids not being allowed to go swimming in school.
* The guy that died on the plane while being deported because he resisted like hell. Consequence? Deportations were stopped, restaints banned. WTF is this shit? Can I now just resist if I don't like the state excerting power over me?
* The left once tried to forbid the media to name the nationalities of the parties involved when reporting crimes. Do you have any idea what a hans Mueller thinks of this when he hears it?
* How the Swiss government let themselves being treatet during the our Lybia crisis.
* How Michelle wears a scarf when she's visiting Iran. 

There are hundrets of those occurences. You read about them every other day. Now please understand that I am trying to show why the SVP wins all the time, not to make any other point.
As long as the left does not really show some strength, even if it might go against their ideals, I fear we will move more to right in the future.

&gt; But the way I see it, all in all, Switzerland seems to be doing pretty well -- as usual.

Absolutely, I one hundret percent agree. ;)
I am just saying that the SP has to stop their utopian let's love everyone line and come down to reality. Because actually I'm quite the humanitarian, but the left let's so much bullshit slide that I simply don't feel comfortable voting for them.
