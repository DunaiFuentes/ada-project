true,meeeow,null,null,"Thanks for the compliment. Me and Biwook are actually dating so the knowledge must have rubbed off from him (He should write a guide to Switzerland, seriously) :))

The biggest expense for you will probably be food and transport. Biwook went through transport extensively, but for food I'd just carefully plan your meals. NEVER buy anything at stations or airports it's very, very expensive. Also remember that things close at 7, everywhere, 5 at weekends and don't open at all on Sundays. So if you're caught short and need to buy something you'll have to go to an over priced corner shop re-selling stuff bought at supermarket or to Aperto/Co-Op Pronto which are an extortion.

I'd suggest stickint to Migros (the main supermarket chain here). Their budget line is pretty good, but they don't sell alchool and cigs. As a result you often find a Denner (their sister store) near by. I think most people go there for booze BUT they also are really really cheap for food. Also, here you pay for carrier bags, so once you paid for one fold it and save it.

But really the key to traveling here is to plan ahead and around the info you already have. Geneva, Zurich and Interlaken are particularly expensive places so get ready. Geneva is boring by the way, instead of staying here I'd plan a trip to Chillon castle which is tres, tres cool. Bring bathing suits too, you can swim in the lake! One more thing. It's really bloody hot here at the moment so I wouldn't bring anything too heavy.
