My mother earns just a little bit more than me, although less tax as she is based in a different canton. My father holds a good position at a large company, so he and my mother get by perfectly well, whilst supporting my younger siblings.

Living here is expensive, but I think it is possible to manage if you look after yourself and your expenses, I find it bizarre that there is still a relatively large uproar about minimum wages, when there are so many jobs earning so well.
