Aarau is full of shitty places. Shitty bars, shitty clubs and lots of shitty hairdressers. However, there's a couple of good places to hang out:

**Clubs**

* [Boiler](http://www.boilerclub.ch/) (Can be shitty, but maybe if you want to meet people and listen to music that was chosen to appeal to everyone... go there.)
* [KiFF](http://www.kiff.ch/) (Most concerts in Aarau happen there)

**Bars/Restaurants**

* [Gossip](http://www.bargossip.ch/) (A bar, sometimes crowded, mostly okay people though.)
* [Krone](http://www.krone-aarau.ch/) (Very good and mostly organic food.)
* Garage (Little bar right next to the church. Try the Absinthe while watching the nuclear plant in Gösgen slowly deteriorate.)

**Hairdressers**

* None. There's really just bad ones.

Sure, it's not Zürich, but I still like the city a lot and go there every once in a while, you just have to know the right places. 

I quite like the [Waage](http://www.waage-aarau.ch/) for a quiet pint on evenings. Or if you prefer to stay with people that are a bit younger, the Pickwick Pub is nice as well. 

The Spaghetti Factory is great for having a nice meal with friends, not the cheapest place but definitely worth it.

And if you like good coffee and real Italian atmosphere, check out the [Bar Cafè Da Matteo](http://www.smagoo.ch/p/2780/2/0/&amp;company=Da_Matteo) or Giusi Bar as it is now called.

People party harder, there is more alcohol, drugs and sex (and fun?).

I'm not an expert but that's what I hear from people that do organize or partizipate in said parties. So I'm not really affiliated, just a more or less close observer.

Now the people started to party in the middle of the city (Bellevue) a couple of weeks ago. I'm not sure whether it was planned, but the party escalated into vandalism and a street fight with police.
