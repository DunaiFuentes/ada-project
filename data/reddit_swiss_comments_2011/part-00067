However I am not unhappy that GLP &amp; BDP won... They are both good parties, imho.

Yes you can witness some people complaining about the country they live in, it happen all the time, everywhere, even Swiss people complain about it all the time, it's always I hate that town, I hate my job, bla bla. Whatever. When it's a valid complain listen to it, if it's not move along.

Do you really think foreigner should praise every bit of Switzerland. It's a nice country, but not everything is beautiful. People can have a hard time, so they have the right to complain about it. It never feel nice when I walk in the street with my wife and hear assholes say ching chong, because she is asian. But like I said whatever fuck them, hopefully they will grow up.

99% of my foreigner friends are awesome people and they make what modern Switzerland truly is. We need those people, and the SVP follower, more than anybody else because they are the one paying their retirement pension.

true,korky1318,vs,Valais,"&gt; I'm really thinking the problem is really complex, and the svp is making it sound really simple. They don't talk about what crime, what is the situation of said foreigner, what are his chances of re insertion etc etc.

See that's exactly the kind of behavior that doesn't change a damn fucking thing. Always going complex about things, and what if, or what when, blabla. My father's been in my town's council during 4 years and honestly that was the worst problem about their debates and progress. Just making a big deal out of anything and in the end you're no further than you were weeks/months ago when you started. 

I'm not saying, for instance on crimes, that we should jump to life sentences based on the mere judge's opinion or something like that, but sometimes I feel like someone has just to, in order to get his point across, spit it out straight the way it is. The SVP kind of meets my opinion on this matter.


As for the complaints, I'm not talking about common complaints concerning jobs, towns, people and such. I'm talking about actually just shitting on everything, and massive disrespect because it isn't going their way or their culture/style. Some Yugoslavs (just an example, as I've actually witnessed it, but it could be anyone else don't get me wrong) blow me away when I hear their opinions on Switzerland in general whereas if it wasn't for us their whole family could of fucking get gunned down in Srebrenica and nobody here would give a shit.
