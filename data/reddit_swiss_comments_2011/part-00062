true,shapul,vd,Vaud,"I depends on the volume and weight of your shipment. Last year I moved from Portland, OR to Zurich. I shipped some books, some electronic devices, clothes and some small items. No furniture. The total shipment was almost 1000 lbs. That's too much for Fedex and probably a bit too small for sea freight. Also, sea freight can take a long time. By long I mean something up to 3 months!

I contacted several international shipment companies and finally one of them found a solution that was not too bad: they sent our stuff by air freight to Netherlands and then by truck from there to Zurich. This solution was almost half of the price of direct air shipment to Zurich! It took only one week and they took care of all paperwork: they just sent a truck to our home in Portland to pickup our boxes and here in Zurich another truck delivered everything. I was very happy with the whole shipment process. The company was: sterlinginternational.com. As for the price, they did it for almost the same price others were asking for sea freight. 

Finally, a word of advice: stick to bigger, well known shipping companies. There are lots and lost of smaller ones if you just simply search by Google. Many of them have very poor services specially when they ship overseas. Sometimes they do not disclose all the costs and details or stop answering you when you are abroad and stuck with some irregularities in your shipment. Ask several of the bigger ones and compare their prices. Read reviews and reports from clients to learn about the company. For our case at that time SterlingInternational was the best but you should definitely shop around a bit before making a decision.

ps. Just to give you an idea about prices, I paid round $3,000 for shipping 1,000 lbs from Portland to Zurich. Three years before that, i.e. in 2008, I paid round $2,500 for shipping round 800 lbs from Lausanne to Portland, also with air freight.
