true,zupatol,ge,Genève,"Swiss german is my mothertongue but I grew up in the french speaking part of Switzerland. I remember having a german friend as a small kid and we had no trouble talking to each other, although at that age we probably didn't have very complicated conversations. The way to deform words and pronunciation to get from one to the other is not so complicated. There are a few differences in vocabulary, and some negligible grammatic differences (Swiss germans don't use one of german's past tenses and a few names have a different gender). I think the difference in vocabulary is maybe just a little bigger than the difference between colloquial english and colloquial american. The biggest hurdle is the pronunciation.

Another way of looking at your question is to ask who understands whom. 

For Germans swiss german is like a dialect. German dialects found in places close to Switzerland are closer to swiss german, so south Germans understand it much more easily than north Germans. There are also different dialects of swiss german, but everyone mostly understands the other dialects, except for the dialects from Wallis which get more and more impenetrable the further you go up the mountain.

The swiss-german-speaking Swiss all understand german, because they learn it at school, hear it on german television and use it every time they need to write - swiss-german is only a spoken language. Cinemas show films dubbed in german, not swiss german. Germans who live in Switzerland usually just learn to understand swiss german but speak in german because everyone understands it, and trying to imitate the accent would sound like an impersonation. The french-speaking Swiss also learn german at school, but they don't like it and most of them forget it rather quickly. They also complain that it doesn't help them understand the swiss-german-speaking Swiss, which is true unless they would spend some time living in the swiss-german-speaking part of Switzerland.

(I tried to spell out things clearly, but it makes it sound awkward. We never speak about swiss-german-speaking Swiss, we call them Swiss-Germans.)

That being said, there's sort of a sliding scale from 'pure dialect' to 'pure Standard German with an accent', which they'll adjust depending on who they're talking with.

Swiss German can be tricky to decipher at first, but simple things should be easy to figure out, and once you've got that down, the rest of it gets easier.

true,djacobson86,usa,USA,"American living in Switzerland here.  You should be fine with English as long as you don't stumble upon pricks like get_some_perspective.  They come down from the mountains from time to time to get their ass pubes shaved and yell at each other. 

You will be more than safe anywhere in Switzerland, so don't worry about travelling alone.   In regards to exchanging money, I've found that the airport will usually give you the best exchange rate(USD-CHF is the lowest it's ever been right now, so only expect to get about 0.92-0.93 CHF for every dollar)  The prices are steep here, so just get use to it.  There won't be a cheaper price at a different store or a cheaper restaurant, they are all ridiculously expensive, just bite the bullet and enjoy your time.  

You will be amazed by the train system. It is incredibly efficient and easy to use.  Like some other posters said there will be a touch screen ticket purchase machine and there should be a little button on the bottom right hand side that will say english.  I'm not sure how it works in Zurich, but here in the canton of Vaud you can usually get a ticket for a certain zone or zones that will allow you to travel by any public transport for the entire day.  It's usually about 6 francs for this day pass.  Like the other poster said, check out sbb.ch and it will give you complete directions including any walking between points.  

Hope you have a great trip to Switzerland.  It is truly a great country.  Shoot me a PM if you have any other questions or anything.
