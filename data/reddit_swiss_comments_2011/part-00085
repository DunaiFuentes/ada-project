- The TPG monthly pass is 70CHF and is well worth it. 
- The Half fare card (Demi-Tarif) is 165CHF for the entire year and is also well worth it. I've already make the money back after a few trips to Zurich and Bern.
- If you still want to eat-out or have cheaper drinks, try the bars and cafes around Plainpalais, I can recommend Le Calamar or Maison des Soupes.
- Looking for a cheaper night out? Try L'Usine or Palladium.

I think a reason that chicken is expensive, is that most chicken in Switzerland also comes from Switzerland. And the laws to protect animals are much more strict in Switzerland than in other countries. And when I see how chicken e.g. in Germany is [produced](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=g38UNClwgLY#t=72s), I don't mind to pay a little bit more for it.",0,1324043038,null,0,true,0,c38l0r2,t3_ndlp4,t1_c38l0r2,t1_c38kf51,1428030756,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

After this, I find it quite normal that the parliament doesn't want them to dictate who gets and doesn't get a seat.

What you describe is purely political parties trying to fuck each other over (and yes the SVP are useless at it - no excuse) - and again you ignore my point about the popular mandate.
