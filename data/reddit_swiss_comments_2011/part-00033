- Hergiswil has a [glassblowing museum](http://www.glasi.ch/) I've heard is worth a visit, but have never been to myself.

It's on offer at the moment, so you get 2 for 1. Make sure you get it before hand though, you can't buy it in Interlaken. If you want to see the Jungfrau it's definitely worth it, since you only pay for the last car going up :)

There's loads to do in Interlaken. I would absolutely go to Lauterbrunnen and visit the [Trümmelbach Falls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trummelbach), it's really worth it. Piz Gloria (Schilthorn) was ok, there are more impressive mountains around that area.

We got a really nice deal for 51.- this weekend. We from Interlaken to Grimmewald, from there we went to a few different alpine villages with different things. You end the trip in Brienz and from there you can get a lovely boat ride to Interlaken Ost, all included in the price. We did a cool hike to see the [Grindelwald Glacier](http://www.flickr.com/photos/seekingrb/2789814232/) which is unfortunately much smaller than it used to be. Other than that I would recommend the [Rothorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brienz_Rothorn_Bahn) (You can catch it at Brienz, about 20 minutes by train from Interlaken Ost) and [Ballenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballenberg). This last one is really, really cool and relatively cheap (About 12.- from Interlaken to Ballenberg West, then 20.- for the tickets) and it's HUGE. Plan to get lost there for sure. You can even bring your own food as they have grills and picnic areas. Also, bring some food to feed the animals, the goats in the Ticino area are awesome :D

If staying in Interlaken, there is a camping site opposite the train station (though you have to go around the bridge because there's no pass, about 10 minute walk). Really nice facilities, showers, kitchen, etc and prime location. Another thing, try to plan ahead and buy your food at the Coop outside Interlaken Ost or the Migros outside Interlaken West. You'll save an absolute fortune. If you want to eat local food, I would do so in the mountains. There is a hike you can do from Grindelwald to a restaurant near-ish the glacier. The view is fabulous even without it though. Try the raclette while you're her btw. Make sure that wherever you stay you get the little card that gives you free transport between the Interlaken station. 

For whatever you want to do though, the best thing is to just take all the flyers you can at the station. There's SO much to do that a post on it would be massive.",0,1309269147,null,0,false,0,c22daas,t3_ib4ns,t1_c22daas,t3_ib4ns,1427292966,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5
