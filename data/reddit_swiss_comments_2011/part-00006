true,Phaedrus85,null,null,"Very different, I would go so far as to say that it is another language. The Zurich dialect is even a bit different from other parts of Switzerland. Be prepared to have lots of conversations about how to correctly say the number ""five"".

If you are an international master's student, I would highly recommend enrolling in a course at the Sprachzentrum. It's a joint operation between ETH and Uni Zurich that provides language courses; for foreign master's students, enrollment in these courses is free. Once you have a basic understanding, I would recommend the theater-games class. Extremely fun!

You will find that most master's courses are offered in English, however, some of the professors haven't translated all of their lecture materials into English. I struggled with this once or twice during my M.Sc.

Most government agencies are very good about dealing with people in English. If your German and French fail you, it is always a good fall back.",0,1297389683,null,0,false,0,c1gbes6,t3_ff6cp,t1_c1gbes6,t1_c1fmysj,1426909138,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
