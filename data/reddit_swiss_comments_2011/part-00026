I am hoping that we get rid of this technology for several reasons :
1. The dangers of the plants when they dysfunctions cannot be accepted because while the risks seem minimal, the consequences are so far reaching and long lasting that they can poison an entire region for thousands of years. In fact, insurance companies are not able to insure for the damages.. Therefore, it's a typical case of privatising profits and collectivising damages.

Finally, while Switzerland might not rest on as big a fault line as Japan, our mountain ranges testify to the tectonic dynamics around them.

true,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"It is clearly possible to switch from fossil and nuclear energy to clean and renewable ressources. People calling nuclear energy safe and cheap don't look at the whole picture. Once again the problem of getting the ressources and getting rid of the waste is not accounted for in any risk or cost equation.

It's shocking to me that there is no final storage facility ANYWHERE on the globe. Instead the waste gets driven around the world and temporarily put somewhere in Russia. Doesn't sound like a very clean and safe technology anymore.

Even though Switzerland is likely not to be target of terrorism any time soon, we don't need to put out dangerous materials for dirty bombs. Just a small quantity of nuclear waste can contaminate large stretches of land (also in cities) as long as you are able to explode it with a normal bomb.

As long as there is no good solution to the problem of waste I cannot with good conscience support nuclear power.

Also the likelyhood of earthquakes is quite high in Switzerland. It's not California or Sendai, but accidents of any kind can't be ruled out.

Also the plan to not renew old nuclear power plant isn't very radical at all. In fact I think it's the only reasonable and realistic decission following a progressive energy policy. Yet the parliament and the people have not decided on the matter, so the decision might still be overturned.

Many people feel horrible about the wind turbines as the appearent only solution to renewable energy. In fact it is very unlikely we build any wind turbines (there is just not enough constant and strong wind). Also new dams are not likely to be built because we already have a dam at each site where it would make sense. Using the sun directly however doesn't seem to come to anybody's mind. Instead of burning oil or gas to have warm water in summer we could use the sun. Also photovoltaic is a very neat solution and could reduce a lot of energy consumption overall.

While the risks *seem* minimal? The risks *are* minimal. The only two nuclear power plants to EVER melt down catastrophically were Chernobyl and Fukushima (3Mile Island did not do any exo-containment damage), both of which failed in ways a Swiss power plant NEVER could. 

Chernobyl was built in an antiquated Soviet style, that is now illegal to still use in a nuclear power plant; it lacked a primary containment shell. Once the pressure vessel burst, only the thin roof separated the cores from the outside.

Fukushima withstood a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and a 14m wave; the only reason it failed was because the *combined* events shut down the coolant pumps. A 9.0 earthquake, even if Switzerland is on a fault line (an incredibly inactive one, at that), will NEVER, mark my words, NEVER happen in or near Switzerland. Flooding is already considered in the safety protocols of active Swiss nuclear reactors, it is pointless to argue that they could cause a full meltdown of the plants.

My point? You're fearmongering. You have no good argument save the one Greenpeace and the green politicians have been feeding you. The risks of failure in Switzerland are infinitesimally small.

&gt;We do not have a safe reliable way of treating all the waste that is generated. They are a hazard for hundreds of years and there is no guarantee that we can durably ensure the safety of the environment and people around them. When corruption occurs it has deadly consequences.

When *corruption* occurs? Please look up how nuclear containment is done. Spent nuclear fuel is very easy to dispose of, and safe to transport in containment cells. These are lined with lead and concrete, and are proven to industry standards to be able to withstand attack or accident, and to be quasi-useless to terrorists.

I'd much rather have my waste resting deep inside a mountain than floating around the French, Bay of Mexico or Alaskan coast (oil), inside my lungs (coal, oil, natural gas) or lining my windows (soot deposit from fossil fuels).

Moreover, a great deal of nuclear waste is now fuel for reprocessing reactors. It can be used to power nuclear plants for even longer.

Again, you're arguing against a strawman out of blind fear. **Abandoning nuclear power in the way you advocate will mean a switch to fossil fuels - because there is no way a renewable energy source will be able to catch up to the lost capacity within any reasonable timespan - or to imported, expensive energy.** Not to mention the hypocrisy of importing French nuclear power.

&gt;The supplies of nuclear fuel and their price are not going to last forever, especially with the new Chinese nuclear boom that is looming, therefore it's important to give clear signals to the energy sector so that the right investments may be made in a timely manner. The first countries to get rid of nuclear power will have it easier than the others.

Another knee-jerk argument. China is looking to set up Thorium reactors and LFTR reactors, along with a series of reactors capable of using U-238.

Uranium is actually quite common. Up to now, however, U-235 has been the fissile material of choice. U-235 makes up less than 1% of the world Uranium supply. Thanks to redirected efforts into fissile materials, U-238, which makes up pretty much the entire remaining 99%, is now a viable alternative. Even if China decides to power itself using 238, there is enough of it to power the entire world for hundreds of years at the very least.

**tl;dr: you're rehashing popular 'green' arguments out of blind fear. You're wrong on all counts, but it is your opinion to remain wrong.

It's a terribly misplaced priority. The greatest danger mankind faces nowadays is global warming caused by CO2 pollution.
Coal, gaz and oil power station output a significant amount of CO2 in our atmosphere and directly threaten the whole planet's population.
Our German neighbours being a stark example of this. Their coal plants are permanent 24/24 7/7 365/365 ecological disasters.


Every MW of alternative energy we use to replace a nuclear station is a MW of alternative energy we can't use to shut down a coal plant/gaz plant/oil plant and bring down our global CO2 emissions ever so slightly down.


I do understand that nuclear energy is far from being ideal and I do support us getting out of it, but before we do that we need to make sure we can replace them with CO2 neutral energy sources. 
The problem is, we are not going to be able to achieve this till we shut down the nuclear stations. Which is why the plans to build gaz stations are now back into play.


It's horrendously stupid, to shut down power plants in one of the safest land in the world when it comes to earthquakes, floods and other natural calamities, we are going to start spewing CO2 into our atmosphere, accelerating global warming...


I for one hope, when minds have cooled down a bit, we'll get the possibilty to chose a more pragmatic solution:

1: Shut down the 5 old reactors as soon as possible, they are old and not as safe as modern reactors can be

2: Build alternative energy up to replace those 5 reactors, what we can't replace with alternative energy replace with one or two modern reactors (so we'd reduce the risk from 5 to 1 or 5 to 2 reactors AND get safer designs to operate in the future)

3: Once alternative energies are capable of replacing the new nuclear reactors, then we can shut those down.


This way we can stop the old reactors faster than the current proposal, dramatically reduce the latent risk of our current nuclear energy and have a pragmatic CO2 free path to a nuclear free future.
