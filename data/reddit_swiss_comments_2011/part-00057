We just got done there. Let's see...

My advice depends on budget, mostly. We were trying to be as cheap as possible, which is really hard in Switzerland. People told us it was expensive, but they didn't tell us that a full dinner at a restaurant would cost us AT LEAST $15.00 each no matter where we went.

In Switzerland, the main grocery chain we came across was called ""Co-op"". There are two train stations in Interlaken (Interlaken West and Interlaken Ost (East)). Across the street from Ost was a Co-op which closed at 7:00 on weekdays. Further away from the city center there was one that closed at 6:30, but downtown was a mini one that closed some time around 9pm. Essentially what I'm saying is if you want to shop for your food, do it early.

Interlaken itself was fairly simple. It's a very pretty town, but all it's really good for is being a central train hub for the region and a tourist destination for those looking to do skydiving, parasailing, etc. If you have a Eurail pass, it will get you as far as Interlaken Ost for free. After that, it will get you discounts on trains (i.e. to Grindelwald or Lauterbrunnen and further) past Interlaken, but it WON'T use up any of your days.

From Interlaken, there's about a 8hr trip (full trip) to Jungfraujoch which is a 180sfr train ride (140 with Eurail pass) up to (near) the top of Jungfrau (""Yoong-frow""), the highest peak in Europe. Best views of the glaciers, valleys, etc on a clear day. There's also a shorter trip for ?80sfr? that takes you to Schilthorn, another viewpoint with a panoramic view of a different landscape. We went to Jungfraujoch so we didn't go to Schilthorn.

If you can, stay in Lauterbrunnen. It is absolutely breathtaking and a tad cheaper than Interlaken. It's also more central to anything worth really seeing. Trains V out from Interlaken into the valley where Grindelwald is (*snore*), or the valley where Lauterbrunnen is (WOWWWWWW). From there they meet up at Kleine Scheidegg to go up to Jungfraujoch. However, Lauterbrunnen is much closer to Schilthorn, and is just a much more enjoyable place to stay. There is a lot to do that is worth walking around for.

true,WearSunscreen,null,null,"We stayed in Lauterbrunnen for a couple days which was absolutely gorgeous. So much scenery to see for about $10.00 if you take the gondola up to Grutschelp and walk above the valley to Murren (you can take a train there, too, if you're lazy). and take a gondola back down to Gimmewald (famous from Rick Steves books) and further down to the valley below into Stechelberg. Then the walk back to Lauterbrunnen is about an hour and is well worth walking because base jumpers, parasailers, and squirrel suit guys jump off the cliffs around you and you can watch them come down and land next to you.",0,1317023714,null,0,false,0,c2mmy3q,t3_jy8q9,t1_c2mmy3q,t1_c2mk58u,1427647922,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

All the other parties are about the MONEY. Like 99% of all political parties worldwide, they almost fully consist of businessmen and businesswomen who are only interested in making more MONEY or opening ways (i.e. make a law that extends music copyrights from 50 to 70 years) to make even more MONEY.
