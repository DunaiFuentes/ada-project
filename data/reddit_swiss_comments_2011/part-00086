Not sure what else to expect, though I'd say be prepared to use public transportation as it might be cheaper and just as fast depending on where you live / work. There are usually ways to pay monthly to get transportation in a specific region.
Also if you want to visit, the 1/2 price abo is a good way to start. It's about 120 bucks a year, I don't know how much it is monthly, you get all fares for half price. It should allow you to visit a lot, since Switzerland is small enough for all this.

Maximum wait at a bus stop: 7-8 minutes.

For traveling through Switzerland, consider getting a [Half-Fare Travelcard](http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/half-fare-travelcard.html). Can't be bought monthly, but If you're planning on traveling by train a lot, it pays for itself.

If your company will provide you with a subscription for public transportation, try to get a [GA](http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/the-general-abonnement/ga-for-individuals.html). They're very expensive, but you get to use any mode of public transportation in Switzerland for free.
