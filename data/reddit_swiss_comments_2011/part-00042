...won't help if 

&gt; visa/residency permit

isn't sorted. Teaching English won't be easy either (it's not as simple to find as in China or South Korea) and also doesn't work without a permit. 

Of course it depends what nationality you are. If you are an EU citizen the work permit is technically already sorted, living permit isn't complicated. 

If you're not from the EU you really need to find a job first. Or move together with someone who has a job. Or bring a boat of cash. Or a sleeping bag.

It will be incredibly hard to rent a place in Zürich if you can't prove you have a steady income.
