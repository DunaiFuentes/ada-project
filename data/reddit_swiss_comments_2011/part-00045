1a - Unless you want a serious (&gt;$1000) mountain or road bike, then just buy a cheap one here.

2 - Buy a pre-paid phone here.  You can get one for 20chf.

3 - You can get a pass that extends to Zurich, but it is only slightly less expensive than the GA (which covers all of Switzerland).  Most likely GA is the way to go.

4 - It's hard to find something before you arrive.  I am guessing you will be at PSI, when you arrive you can look at the bulletin boards at PSI, there is a lot of stuff posted.  Baden is probably the best place to live, it's 15 min from PSI and 15 from Zurich main station, and has more life than Brugg or any of the other little villages in the area.  There is pretty much nothing at Villigen, you will be very bored if you live there for 10 months.

Bonus) There are no cheap bars in Switzerland.  To meet people, IAESTE does stuff constantly, you don't have to be a member.  There are plenty of other expat things to do, you'll be fine.

true,file-exists-p,null,null,"My own method to deal with telemarketers consists of being very polite for 10s, and then put the phone on the table (without hanging up) and go on doing what I was doing before being interrupted. Usually they go on speaking for ~1min. Hang up when you hear the ""tuut tuut tuut tuut"" which means they hanged up.

This worked remarkably well:

 1. It cost them money, which is what you want.

 2. It is fun! You are more annoying and rude than they are.

 3. You can try to break my current record: 1min45s of uninterrupted speech before they hanged up.

&gt; How Michelle wears a scarf when she's visiting Iran.

This was a surprisingly big deal in the media and the public in general. It really baffles me how in one only saying, foreigners are expected to comply with our customs, but when we (in that case mrs. calmy-rey) do the same, it's actually considered a small scandal. I really don't get this. 

Another conundrum for me is why there is so much fuss about some fundamental islamic people, while the many (and growing numbers) of christian fundamentalists, that are all too often found as teachers in our schools, go largely unmentioned.

If they say ""the telephone book"" I ask them if they have seen the asterisk. They usually hang up almost immediately.

If they say ""from my supervisor"" I ask immediately to talk to the supervisor and refuse to continue the conversation.
