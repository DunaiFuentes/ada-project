Here are some quotes from a [link]( http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/Swiss_stage_world_s_first_antifeminism_event.html?cid=28666110 ) in the above article,
&gt; “A lot of people have the wrong impression about what an antifeminist really is,” said Andersson.

&gt;""They believe that an antifeminist is a woman-hater. Not at all. An antifeminist is a kind of peacekeeper who wants to return things to normal. As an antifeminist I believe in true equality between a man and a woman.” 

&gt; In a written statement prepared for Saturday’s meeting, Andersson has drawn up five key beliefs of antifeminists: “opposing the feminist hatred of men, valuing the nuclear family, believing in the child’s rights to both its parents after a divorce or a separation, looking at the individual and not judging people by their gender, and accepting that men and women are different and counting that as assets”. 

Here is a quote from the anti feminist [website]( http://www.antifeminismus.ch/english/definition/index.php) itself.

&gt; The outcry of some left-wing extremists youngsters that antifeminists would want to turn back the clock, to put women back into the kitchen and to deny them their emancipation does not represent reality. 

&gt; Why should antifeminists want that? What would men gain from that? Women back into the kitchen and men back into the factories? Which man would want that?

I think that last line could not be more true. When feminists label any descent towards them as being misogynistic or akin to wanting women back in the kitchen they are just using scare tactics. Its also obnoxious to claim that they speak for all women or that they are the authority on equality... especially when they fought against it [time and time again]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/g2eme/feminists_tell_you_that_the_solution_to_mens/ ).

Many men, children, and women have been hurt by feminism or can see the damage that it does that has nothing to do with women being emancipated; enough with the misogyny attacks.
