I don't know if this makes sense, but even though I don't believe in God, I value the monument, I value the effort that was put into it, I value the symbol of people coming together to celebrate life, and I wish that all of us could be the heirs to this tradition without a question of faith, which is mainly a hypocritical oath nowadays for people who want a church marriage.

A **decent** beer will usually cost you about 5-7 francs for the small one,  7-10 for the big one.  Maybe a little bit more if you are going to a nicer bar or restaurant.  


Websites for apartment searching:

These are the best ones I've come across and what I used in my search.

[Homegate](http://www.homegate.ch/rent/apartment-and-house/switzerland?a=default&amp;l=default&amp;incsubs=default)

[Home.ch](http://www.home.ch/en/rent/residential) 

I really suggest checking glocals as well.  It's an expat website that will have some apartment listings on there.   Highly recommend taking a look through the whole website too- really good info in there and also a good way to meet other expats!

true,mathiscool,zh,Zürich,"I'm pretty sure that you can keep your old car insurance as long as you don't change your plates. Which I think you have to do if you live here long enough. This can be quite expensive, though, as you might have to pay import tax on the car, I'm not 100% sure, but this is really important.

Car insurance in Switzerland can be anywhere from 400 to 2000 chf a year, depending on your previous driving record and the car. You can check the price [here](http://en.comparis.ch/).

Don't forget about health insurance which is one of the most expensive in Geneva, compared to other cantons. Basic walk-in insurance will cost you around 350 CHF/month, private ward +75CHF/month.",0,1310172009,null,0,false,0,c24h5zc,t3_ik756,t1_c24h5zc,t3_ik756,1427329404,0,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,0
true,ours,vd,Vaud,"Allow me to recommend you not to take your car. You can pretty much go around Switzerland and even France/Italy/Germany by train. You can pretty much reach anyplace via train and, for the most neck-of-the-woods towns via postal bus. Geneva is also a nightmare to drive in but has lots of buses and trams. If you do take the train, the first thing you should do is buy a half-fare subscription. You can take one for 1 or two years and all public transports are half-price (as the name suggests) with that card and that's a good thing because otherwise transportation is relatively expensive.

In Geneva the price of beer depends quite a lot where you take it. The city centre (rule of thumb: the closer to those fancy bank buildings, the closer to the centre you are) is quite a bit more expensive. But check this out, in some expensive restaurants beer costs *less* than a bottle of water. Count around 4-5CHF for a standard beer (plate of the day goes around 17CH at noon in a nice restaurant, they make up with the drinks).",0,1310206010,null,0,false,0,c24jjko,t3_ik756,t1_c24jjko,t3_ik756,1427330621,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
