true,shinnen,zh,Zürich,"But defence spending creates jobs too. Don't forget that by buying planes you're not just creating pilots but hundreds of surrounding jobs. I was thoroughly impressed with the presentation at the airbase in Meiringen.

true,csssss_,world,Auslandschweizer,"You are only looking at one side of the equation. While it is true that defense spending creates jobs, it is also true that the money used to pay for it must have come from somewhere else. Just as jobs are created in the defense sector by increasing spending there, jobs will be lost in other sectors by reduced spending there.

Now the question is: If we have millions of francs to spend, do we want to spend them on defense or on something more useful? There are dozens of better things to spend that money on, like healthcare, social security, reducing taxes...",0,1321234546,null,0,false,0,c2zk1yg,t3_mamg0,t1_c2zk1yg,t1_c2zjfnt,1427873741,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

I think it all boils down to this.
Do we, the Swiss people, want to have the capability to deny our airspace to other planes (be it american, another nation or a terrorist organisation)?
If yes, then we ought to buy them, if no, then we ought not to.

What I dislike with Neirinck's argument is that he conflates the political will to use a tool and the usefulness of the tool itself.

true,TWanderer,vd,Vaud,"This entire ""we have to create jobs"" story is just a marketing strategy from governments, but in general doesn't make sense at all. Especially if it's used as an argument on its own, so like ""let's just throw some money at this or that, just 'because it creates jobs'"". It does make sense to e.g. spend extra money / manpower on constructing roads, if they need to be replaced anyway, because then you have the benefit of the newer roads. Why the heck do you need to 'create' artifical jobs ? Let's say that there are 10 people on an island, and 5 of these people do all the work, and there is no work left for the other people. Do you really need 'to create jobs' for these people ? Wouldn't it be just better that everybody works a bit less, and the jobs are just spread over the 10 people .... 
An extreme example is Japan, there the unemployment is low, but the kind of jobs people do is also crazy. E.g. next to road construction works there is this entire bataljon of guys standing with flags (like in F1), just to warn people, and it's completely useless, these things that are done in Europe by warning lights and so on. These kinds of jobs over there are 'created' by the government to lower the unemployment, just because they manage to brainwash everybody over there ...
