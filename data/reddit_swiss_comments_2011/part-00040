true,urbanradar,bs,Basel-Stadt,"I don't know if there are any differences between how things are handled for Swiss citizens and EU citizens, but I (Swiss citizen) recently became a freelancer, and here's (roughly) what I learned:

Basically, as soon as you start working under your own name and earning money, you are legally considered a one man company - no paperwork involved. However, you do need to register as a freelancer with your local pension and compensation fund (Ausgleichskasse). The compensation fund can then decide to legally recognise your freelance status, or to deny it. But usually, you'll be fine as long as you fulfill the following criteria:

- You work under your own name and send out invoices under your own name
- You make your own investments and pay for your own business costs
- Your company name includes your name (or is identical to your name)
- You work for more than one customer

In order to register, you need to fill out a fairly simple form and send it to the local pension fund, along with evidence that you really are working as a freelancer. Evidence can include anything from business cards, printouts of your own websites, copies of estimates and invoices you've sent out, a description of your services, etc.

Once the pension fund has acknowledged your freelance status, you're fine. You can also have yourself inscribed into the local business register, but this is only mandatory above a certain income.

The advantage to doing things this way is that it's cheap, simple and straightforward. The downside is that there is no legal separation between your personal finances, debts and properties and those of your company.

If you don't want to register as a one man company, there is also the option of founding a corporation (GmbH or AG), which is itself a legal person -- however, this is more complex and expensive. Registering a GmbH requires you to have (IIRC) CHF 10'000.- in capital, for example.

Since you said you'd like to avoid unnecessary administrative overhead and bureaucracy, and since it sounds like you'll be working mainly on your own, a one man company should probably be fine for you.

However, your mileage may vary and I am not a lawyer, so I encourage you to research further before you come to a decision.",0,1311683768,null,0,false,0,c2811n3,t3_j01z9,t1_c2811n3,t3_j01z9,1427394811,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

If you want to live in Switzerland, be aware that everything is more expensive than in France, particularly the rent and the health insurance, which is mandatory. On the other hand some people seem to think it might be possible to have a company in Switzerland without living there, if you don't live too far away from the border.
