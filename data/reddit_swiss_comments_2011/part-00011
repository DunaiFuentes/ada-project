  * ""social security for the Swiss instead of self-service store for immigrants from all over the world""

  * ""priority for Swiss people in housing and work""

  * ""stop Islamization and third-world-ization""

  * ""Swiss character, keep Zürich white""

  * ""It is better for them to remain on their continent""

  * ""You have to protect us if we want to survive!""

true,noonee,null,null,"""Swiss character, keep Zürich white"" - I'll take a wild guess, here. The average SD voter probably loathes Zurich's urban environment, left/green government and ""rampant bourgeoisie"". However, suddenly the city everyone at the regular's table usually is running down has to be urgently protected for its ""white"" legacy?

I didn't even know there was an urgent issue of foreign, dark-skinned infiltration in Zurich - at least it didn't occur to me during the last 8 years which I've spent here. 

The increasing xenophobic tendencies are starting to really worry me. I hope the political representatives are able to keep up with the more moderate decision making and won't let themselves be carried away by destructive populist opinions.
