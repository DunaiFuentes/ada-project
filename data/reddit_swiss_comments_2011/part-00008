true,Sandok,null,null,"I would have to agree. OK, I might have some bias since I grew up in Lausanne (well around Lausanne), but I currently work in Geneva and from a local point of view, these two cities are quite different.

Lausanne is very Swiss, you mostly hear French, and it’s quite small and organized around a few central hubs. It's also very picturesque and personally, the nightlife in Lausanne is far more relaxed and enjoyable than most places.

Geneva is highly international, has a lot of international people as such (in the majestic TPG, you rarely hear French...) and from a proud Swiss Romand point of view, everyone considers Geneva ""part of France"". It's a stereotype, sure, but in the many months of work here (and more), I think its true.

But to OP, I moved from Connecticut to Switzerland when I was young (10 years old) and just so you know, for your kids, it shouldn't be too tough to adapt to the language and culture. Kids are kids!

true,telllos,vd,Vaud,"&gt;Bad things - something of a stereotype, but after 3 years here, I've found it to be fairly true: Switzerland is quite boring by the standards of most other countries. Here, I don't mean that the Swiss people are boring, just that they're very family/club orientated and don't really engage people outside of that formal frame-work. I've found the best solution is to organize lots of dinners and parties at your apartment - once you break-down the walls a little, Swiss people are just as social as everyone else.

Sad, but very true, we are not really outgoing. it's not in our nature. ",0,1298288465,null,0,false,0,c1hnz81,t3_fo96h,t1_c1hnz81,t1_c1hfnel,1426932561,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
true,zachv,null,null,"I'm an American who moved here for school, and have had pretty good luck so far. Here's a quick overview of my thoughts:

I have two part time jobs here, doing programming and translation, and each of them pay more than 3x what my part time job in the US paid. Wages here are high, as zupatol says. Prices are also higher, but I think that the increased wages more than offset that.

I came here already knowing German, but I know several people here who don't speak a word of French or German and get by just fine. Especially in the German part, most everyone in a city speaks at least a bit of English - once you get out of the city a bit it's a different story, though. There are classes offered by Migros (one of the big supermarket chains) for French, German, Italian, etc, so you'll have a chance to learn if you want.

Regarding the work visa... I have a simple B-class residence permit and can work 15 hours per week as a student, but I have also heard some conflicting stories about visas as well. Since your wife has a Master's , that would definitely help.


Transportation in Switzerland is pretty good. Most people seem to have a GA, which lets you ride all public transportation for free, or a ""Halbtax"" which gives you half off. People do have cars, but if you live in a city like Zurich or Geneva, you likely won't need one.


Despite Switzerland's reputation for disliking foreigners (somewhat hypocritically as 20% of the population is non-Swiss), everyone seems really interested and friendly when they find out I'm an American.
