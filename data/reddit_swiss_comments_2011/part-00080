In order to become a Swiss citizen, either your father or your mother must be a Swiss citizen (or you have to apply for naturalization, see article 1 of the PDF linked below). However, it is unlikely that your father will still be able to get a Swiss passport. Since your father was born outside of Switzerland and is already a citizen of another country, the law states that he must request citizenship before the age of 22 or it will be lost (see article 10). I'm guessing your father is older than that, so he probably lost his right to a Swiss passport by now.
