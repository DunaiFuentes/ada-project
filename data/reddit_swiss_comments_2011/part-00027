true,Vlip,be,Bern,"Heating and hot water is mostly done via gaz or oil burners. There is only a small part of Swiss houses that do those via electricity. Air conditioning is already severly regulated and only allowed for a select few cases so I doubt we'll get much economies in that front either.
The only way you'll get real economies is if you force the Swiss people to make painful cuts on their quality of life, ie less TVs, less computers, less phones, less trains,... That's not going to fly.

The solar thermal collectors are nice till it gets cloudy (unheard of in Switzerland, I know ;)) and during the winter. Obviously we could then switch to an electric heater but that would mean our electricity consumption peak would be at the precise moment our energy production would be at its lowest... That's not going to end well.


Efficiency measures are nothing new, we have been going after them for a long time already and all they did was slightly reduce the rate at which our consumption of electricity increases.


As for your importing plan, it is based on an electric grid that doesn't exist and on the assumption that somehow other countries will be able to build so much renewable energy production that they could spare sending some our way. That sounds hardly like a solid plan for the future.",0,1306475901,null,0,false,0,c1wadwe,t3_hjubs,t1_c1wadwe,t1_c1w6o8c,1427185850,0,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,0

true,canteloupy,vd,Vaud,"Nuclear or petrol/coal is not the only choices we have. I truly will work as much as I can so that our energy can come from safer sources than these.

I used to think the green party's position was only ideological until I read reports on how you can actually use renewable energy together with decrease of energy consumption to cut our use of nuclear power. If the governments backs it up, I'm sure that it's not out of blind fear or populist sentiment, but because it can realistically be done.

As far as nuclear waste not floating around in the ocean, I suggest you look up what the mafia has done to the Italian nuclear waste, it's very enlightening.",0,1306489116,null,0,false,0,c1wb0a1,t3_hjubs,t1_c1wb0a1,t1_c1w4fae,1427186144,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

We do not tap it, because we need all the drills and money to drill holes trough our mountains for Trucks who bring tons and tons of cheap Spanish veggies and fruits and to channel all the Germans who somehow need to rush to Italy for a few days around the Zombie Jesus event every year (No offense, Germans :-) ).   
.  
We also do not tap it because that would mean that our country could have their own energy in abundance AND  self sustaining! OMG! Who would want something like that? How could we even start explaining that to the shareholders?

TL;DR: We could use geothermal energy, but we don't, because MONEY.   
It's my personal opinion. I am not a Geophysicist or whatever you have to be to scientifically know this stuff. ",0,1306785475,null,0,true,0,c1wucaj,t3_hjubs,t1_c1wucaj,t1_c1w7k7l,1427195465,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
