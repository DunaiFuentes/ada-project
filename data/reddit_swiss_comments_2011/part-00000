They take your money and use most of it for buerocracy. And they CAUSE a horrific medical system. Any dumbass doctor can order useless CT scans or worse. No-one checks if it's economically sound. 

The insurance is NOT a cornerstone of the social security, its simply a scam. See the dental care. Social security pays ALL the costs for low or no income people without any insurance.

For ""average joe"" the money you pay into insurance is much more than what you get out. This payout ratio can be very low. Even with very expensive care, you pay more into insurance (in your lifetime) than what the expensive care costs. This is the way insurance works. All insurances ALWAYS cost your ""average joe"" more than they get paid out. Insurance is per definition only a good deal for the seller.


Another effect of the insurance craziness is as seen in another post the chemotherapy for cancer. Widely used, very painful, and proven to work only on a few types of cancer (another scam). The whole medical mafia is FULL of such scams. And insurance is like a money printing machine for the healthcare mafia.

According to the people of St.Gallen it is taboo to add mustard to your OLMA Bratwurst. It shows that you are not of the region.

As sort of a joke people get overly offended if you ask for mustard at the Bratwurststand.

The sausage has one that Munich white sausage similar consistency. The fried sausage of the fair OLMA (east Swiss land and dairy exhibition) inherited the name.
