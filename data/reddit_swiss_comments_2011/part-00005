You probably received / will receive the link to the housing office. They have listings on their intraweb. But it will likely be challenging to secure a place if you are not in Zurich. 

&gt;* Any textbooks I should be familiar with? Book suggestions in general are also welcome.

I don't know for the CS program. Generally, however, if you have additional requirements you need to take, you might want to start looking at those courses and what books they use. http://vvz.ethz.ch

&gt;* Should I start learning German? I studied French in high school but it's a bit rusty.

Swiss German is the main language used in Zurich. At ETH, people tend to revert to English because people from all over Switzerland and the world come to ETH. French will be useful because signs are often in multiple languages (I look at the French and Italian when I don't understand something that's in German). But yes, start learning German if you have the time. On that note, there are intensive language courses offered the 2 weeks before the semester starts. They are free (you only pay for the photocopying). Language courses are offered free for master's students during the semester.

&gt;* How is the social life?

Knowing German helps a great deal. But there is enough of a international presence that it will be fine. There are parties almost every Thursday.

true,bbqwtfomg,null,null,"First of all congratulations to getting accepted at ETH!

Securing a place in Zurich is, even if you are there, pretty challenging. If you want to take a look at flats you have to be at the flat at the announced date or you just can't inspect it. Prices for flats are currently on an all time high. Moreover you don't need to live in the center of Zurich to get to ETH fast as the local transit is plain awesome (look up how long it would take you from your flat to ETH). A few links to look up some flats:

* [Homegate](http://www.homegate.ch/)
* [Immobilien](http://www.immobilien.ch/) or [ImmoScout24](http://www.immoscout24.ch/) (they should use the same database if I recall correctly)
* and [Comparis](http://www.comparis.ch/immobilien/default.aspx)

There are no textbooks you should be familiar with in general, but knowing the textbooks of your focus area is preferable (yet not required).

Although learning German is not necessary as more or less everyone in Zurich speaks English pretty well (from employees in Coop/Migros over beggars to train drivers) or can translate for you it is recommended as it makes your life much easier (understanding signs or official letters you get from the city or ETH which are in Standard-German not Swiss-German).

The social life in Zurich is pretty pricy if you go clubbing but there are casual/student parties more or less every week, most cinemas show movies in English (with German, French or English subtitles) and you have an extensive sports program (www.asvz.ch). 

Furthermore you should check out if you have to get another health insurance or an extension to your current one.

My recommendation is that you check flats out in person, maybe try to find a lot of viewings in one week and just visit Zurich for this week. Moreover you should outstand in your flat application (some flats had 30 to 50 people who were viewing it in just 1 hour during business hours!) just as you outstood other people in your ETH application (focus here: credit standing: can you pay the rent or will your parents/family back you up; have you worked in the past, were the employers satisfied with your performance; are you reliable etc).

I see there are already very good and detailed replies all around. I'll try to add some stuff and emphasize some. 

If you're going to remember one thing about life in Zurich, remember this:


Housing is going to be your biggest problem.



The internal housing offer from ETH will be only for a one-person room, and if you want to register your SO as a resident in Switzerland, this won't work. You can temporarily register two people in a one-person accomodation, but there's a time limit on that (something like 3 months, if I'm not mistaken).

I no longer live in Zurich, but if you pm me with your price range and any specifications, I'll be happy to ask around friends. I know some of them are leaving soon and there might be vacancies. Also, depending on my friends' graduation status, I could e-introduce you to some CS MSc. students :)


I'd say don't worry about textbooks. I've observed that pretty much all of my CS friends were using the course notes, or the internet. 


People understand German, though as it's pointed out their native tongue is Z端rchert端端tsch. I was able to live 2 years in Zurich with barely any German, as daily shopping, etc. is very simple anyway, and for legal matters and such, people speak English. I must add Switzerland is no place to learn or improve German. Living with 4 Swiss people, I tried immerse myself in the language, but the Swiss German hasn't helped my budding German, at all.


For social life, if you're not going to be in a student house, you'll have to look for it in school. [VIS](http://www.vis.ethz.ch/en/home/) is your department's student club, and is populated by a lot of international students, who are looking for the same thing you are :) [VSETH](http://www.vseth.ethz.ch/) is the largest one, and they're really magnificent at organizing large events, but it's mostly Swiss undergrads. Most of their meetings, etc. are conducted in Swiss German.

Here are a few places that I used to go to, and that I miss dearly:

[Mehrspur](http://www.mehrspur.ch/): Rather small ""jazz"" club which doesn't limit itself to traditional jazz. There's always some interesting and/or different band playing at Mehrspur.

[Helsinki](http://www.helsinkiklub.ch/): A very small club with a lot of character. The surroundings and the internals are not much to look at, but again, good music. With a slight bent on the rap/hip-hop scene.

[Rimini](http://www.rimini.ch/): This is great in summers. Especially if you can claim those on-the-water pillow areas. So relaxing and peaceful on a summer evening.


Misc. tips:

* [English Forum Switzerland](www.englishforum.ch) is a valuable information source where you can access a lot of first-hand experience. 
* You can rent cars from ETH at cheaper prices. Really useful for when you go IKEA shopping. 
* [ASVZ](http://portal.asvz.ethz.ch/Seiten/default.aspx) is the best gym in Zurich and it's practically free for you as a student. (there's a mandatory 25 CHF yearly fee). You can even take classes, make sure to check it out.
* [SBB](www.sbb.ch) can route your way from address to address, and if you get the iPhone app, you can even buy tickets on-the-fly and just show the QR code to ticket control. Don't trust Google Maps' public transport option, always use SBB.
* If you want to travel around in Switzerland get the yearly [Halbtax](http://mct.sbb.ch/mct/reisemarkt/abonnemente/halbtax.htm) and [Gleis 7](http://www.gleis7.ch/home/) cards. They'll pay for themselves pretty quickly. Also, for transport within Zurich, you can get a yearly card for cheaper (2-3 months free). I think you can even suspend it if you leave Switzerland for holidays and such.

* If you're not against shopping at discount supermarkets, shopping at ALDI will make a huge difference in your budget. Get the basics from there and buy the more fancy/quality stuff from Coop or Migros. Food is expensive in Zurich. For fast food, Turkish kebab shops are your best bet, they have the best price/performance ration in my opinion.

immo.search.ch can give you an overview of what might be available, and you can scan neighborhoods for price ranges and sizes. Keep in mind though that about 50 people will be interested for each. I know it's hard but personally I'd try to hit up visitation times for WG (apartments with roommates) in a week of vacation early in the summer when students are leaving if you haven't found anything by then (which you should absolutely try to!!!). For private apartments, it can be hard on a student permit, people tend to look for Swiss citizen and permanent residents, since there is a hughe housing crisis they can afford to choose. Otherwise try the English language forums for people subletting stuff.

English is enough to live there. You might not even learn German at all during your stay!

The social life has to come from you, you have to go to the different events. But there are many, such as the Xchange nights or the Stutz parties. Another great thing is the sports center, which offers a really wide range of activities. In fact, you can take yoga or pilates classes right next to the computer room (really more for girls, but really nice for stressed out students). The rest of the sports activities are really close too.

I honestly didn't do anything cultural while I was there so... sorry. I went to the big tourist things the grossmunster, the Swiss museum, the lake, but I used to go back home on week-ends.

I have to say though, it's a tough market, I've known a friend who although living in Switzerland before going to Z端rich had to spend a few weeks sleeping on someone's couch to find something. I started in September myself and went in July to visit a bunch of things, but mainly I was lucky. Most of the time you really have to be there for a few days and talk to the people personally, get to know them a bit, look charming etc, most often while you're competing with several others. The people just set up a date and wait for the crowd to show up. You have to visit a few to get chances of landing one.

I've gathered that for apartment visits it's pretty much the same, but worse, though thankfully only did it in another city where the pressure is a bit less. The tough thing there is the competition, and the file you're asked to give, where you need all the details showing that you're going to pay rent, that you're allowed to stay in Switzerland, etc. It includes a statement from the office of pursuits (basically the debt collection office), salary or parents' salary proof, etc. I think if you're here on a student visa this will be really tough.

I advise you to start looking for a flat 2 months in advance. You may be able to find a subsidized flat through JUWO or WOKO. In general it is difficult to rent a flat as a student because you don't have a steady source of income. It doesn't help that you will probably be given an L (temporary) residence permit. 

Luckily you are from a country *north* of Switzerland (considered to be ""tidier"" :-) ).

I would recommend getting a letter from either your parents, or the parents of your SO saying that they are willing to come up with the rent if you are unable to. 

Also, they'll ask you for a /Betreibungsregisterauskunft/. This is a document you can get from your local Administration building for about 17 CHF, once you are registered as a resident. It shows that you have no outstanding debts. If you can get a document like that from Iceland and include it in any housing application, it will improve your chances.

Regarding books, you'll need to be more specific about the direction of your CS degree.
