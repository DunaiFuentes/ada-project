true,Tarlitz,null,null,"Port du soleil is awesome. It's one of my favourite areas to go and it's absolutely HUGE. You can ski for a day and never take the same slope twice. Though it is quite expensive. If you are in for long scenic routes, you are in for a treat. Everything is clearly marked and there are always people and maps around. You won't get lost easily :)

My favourite region would be between Les Crosets and Avoriaz. Many great and long slopes here and a few snow parks (if you are into that) and the notorious Swiss wall if you are feeling dangerous. Often our first stop is Avoriaz and then we see where we go (about 3 lifts from where I'm usually staying -- about 45-60 min) from there.

Avoriaz is pretty much the epicentrum of skiing activity in Port du soleil with lots of activity, events and people. I have never stayed there, but the apartments look quite small and cheap and I think it's many young people there who just go for skiing and social events. It's a very high, car free town that's surrounded by slopes. You can ski right through it and visit one of the many bars/cafes there for a drink or lunch (which is something we often do. Yeti bar &lt;3 :) ). Secondary to that you have great towns like Chapel, Champery, they are a bit lower down, but offer great connectivity to Les Crosets/Avoriaz.

The Les Gets/Morzine area is also very nice, but very expensive from what I remember.

Places to avoid would be Morgins (mostly suited for beginners and connection to Avoriaz is terrible), though the view over the lake from the nearby Torgon is absolutely stunning.

Got to go now, but in short, check out Les Crosets/Avoriaz!",0,1325144277,null,0,false,0,c3c2nbr,t3_nue7i,t1_c3c2nbr,t3_nue7i,1428091395,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
