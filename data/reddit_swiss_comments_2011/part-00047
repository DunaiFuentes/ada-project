&gt;It's my understanding that the Swiss speak a variety of languages but I am only fluent in English and Spanish, will there be any communication issues?

There are four official languages, german, french, italian, and romansch. However, it is not hard to find someone who speaks english. Don't be too worried about it.

&gt;Should I use Euros or Swiss Francs?

Switzerland is not part of the EU, so you'll need to use francs.

&gt;What's the country's policy (legal/social) on marijuana?

It's illegal. I wouldn't recommend smoking there, personally.

&gt;What's a MUST SEE? Where do I absolutely have to go?

I would say the Matterhorn, the Lauterbrunnental, and Bern's Altstadt (old town).

You have to take a train up from the village below because they do not allow vehicles with combustion engines there. The lodging is still relatively cheap if you plan it right.

Everything there is within walking distance.

My favorite time to visit was when the Swiss, German, or Italian women's national teams have their tryouts there. Great parties, but October will be a little late for that. The skiing in the morning may be the only good time if the weather is warm.

Get a ""swiss pass"" a ticket (expensive like everything) that would let you ride any train, bus or boat in Switzerland that is not private. Even free entry to most museums. Then i'd stay somewhere in Luzern overnight and in the morning I'd take the ""Golden Pass"" (a special train for tourists - slow but beautiful route). Get out wherever you like it. Brienz is nice (http://www.google.co.uk/m/search?site=images&amp;source=mog&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=uk&amp;client=safari&amp;q=hotel%20giessbach&amp;sa=N - i had my wedding there). Take a boat ride on lake Brienz. It's my favorite lake in Ch. If you have a lot of time and interested in such things visit ""ballenberg"" a huge open air museum with very old houses that were brought there from all over Switzerland. Also there are actors living there showing how every day life might have been. 

Back on the golden pass you travel through simmental. Secret tip: get out in Erlenbach and take the cable car to the middle or top station (stockhorn). Beautiful mountain lakes. Hike 1-2 h around the lake - go for a swim if you're tough then find the place where they rent out the kick boards. Ride down the mountain road for +1h. (we used to do this trip on shrooms but it's nice even without). Back on the train, head to Gstaad, don't go out unless you want to see how the Russian Oligarchs live. Final stop is in Montreux and spend the night there. Pay a visit to Freddy Mercury. If you like Castles chateau chillon is a must see the next day. 

You won't be able to do everything unless you stay somewhere over night. 

You can also do it the other way around by starting in Montreux. Or there is another touristy route called ""glacier express"" also very beautiful between Arosa and Zermatt.

Ask away if you need something to know.
