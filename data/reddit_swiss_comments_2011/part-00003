I have yet to see any argument that wasn't a crass appeal to emotions.
The SVP is whining about traditions and fear.
The initiants talk about irrelevant statistics and another kind of fear.

I have yet to find anyone who brought a rational argument on this subject.

I also don't think it matters that much. 
The weapon at home is a tradition, but it's also one that has little to no benefits to society. I mean, does anyone really believe national security is improved by it? IMHO it's a very long stretch.
On the other hand, I don't see how taking those weapons away will have any benefit to society either.

Quite clearly your issue is with domestic violence. I don't think limiting the scope to guns is logic in any way. As you said, if you don't have a gun you can use a knife.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Switzerland#Gun_crime
From this article:
&gt;Police statistics for the year 2006[12] records 34 killings or attempted killings involving firearms, compared to 69 cases involving bladed weapons and 16 cases of unarmed assault. Cases of assault resulting in bodily harm numbered 89 (firearms) and 526 (bladed weapons). As of 2007, Switzerland had a population of about 7,600,000. This would put the rate of killings or attempted killings with firearms at about one for every quarter million residents yearly. This represents a decline of aggravated assaults involving firearms since the early 1990s. The majority of gun crimes involving domestic violence are perpetrated with army ordnance weapons, while the majority of gun crime outside the domestic sphere involves illegally held firearms.[13]

According to those numbers it seems we ought to retask our priorities to bladed weapons, not guns...

Locking away the 250k military issue guns doesn't make any sense to me. The initiative claims that people who need guns and are trained in their use should be able to keep them. That sounds like the perfect description of a soldier to me.

Furthermore, these guns are about 10% of guns in private households, yet the initiative specifically names these guns. Why? Is this initiative about gun safety or the army? Not that I'm a big fan of the army, it's just that I dislike dishonesty.

The initiative also aims to prevent suicides and domestic violence, but I don't see how it would acomplish that.

I agree that taking away guns from suicidal people will prevent them from shooting themselves, but hanging or overdose or jumping in front of a train is equally deadly.

On the point of domestic violence: If you feel threatened by a gun in your home, ask the one who owns it to remove it. Explain why you want it gone.

First is your best bet, it's mostly for either a room in a shard apartment, or people who sub-let their rooms for a fixed amount of time.  Second is mostly stuff in Germany, but some in Switzerland (same thing).  Third is mostly for actually renting, like with a contract and everything, not likely possible for you.

I think you can't open a bank account without at least a ""B"" residence permit, but I'm not 100% sure. (your best chance will be through Post Finance).

To swim, I'm sure there are plenty of pools around, but mostly likely they will be expensive, like everything in Switzerland (range of 6-8 CHF per entry if I had to guess)
