true,roborabbit,null,null,"The most important thing that you can do for visiting Switzerland is to get a Swiss Pass. To ride the trains in Switzerland is very expensive. On my last trip to Switzerland I saved well over 50% of what the tickets would have cost had I purchased them as I went. The pass includes all of the federal trains, buses and ships as you want to ride for one price. The pass also gets you discounts on museums, mountain railways and other activities. A 2nd Class pass for 4 days will cost around $295. 2nd Class on the trains is plenty comfortable. You must purchase the pass ahead of time. You cannot purchase it when you are in Switzerland. [Raileurope](http://www.raileurope.com) website is where I get my pass from.

The Swiss railways website is helpful in planning. www.sbb.ch
Click “en” at the top for English. 

The railway station offices are very helpful in providing maps and information on attractions.

That said here are three of my favorite cities.

Luzern. I take everyone that visits Switzerland there. Make sure you check out the Lions monument. The Chapel Bridge is hard to miss. From Luzern you can easily make it to Rigi or Pilatus to get a nice view from the mountains overlooking the lake and cities. You will have to decide between Rigi or Pilatus it takes a little while to get to the top and back. If you want to go to Rigi get on one of the Lake ships, have lunch on the ship and get off at stop for Rigi. Pilatus is very cool as it has outdoor activities such as zip lines. The transport museum in Luzern is very cool but I was able to spend the entire day there from open to close. 

Geneva. Nice city. I recommend both the Red Cross Museum and the UN.

Zermatt. Best done spending the night in Zermatt. No cars there except for electric buses. The air is very clean and the view of the alps is spectacular. It is a good destination for outdoor type activities. Lots of hiking in the mountains. From Zurich to Zermatt takes about 3 Hours 15 minutes by train. There are lots of hotels available in Zermatt. They are listed on a board at the Zermatt train station. Though you can easily find hotels for Zermatt on the internet. I recommend the Gornergrat Railway to get you up into the mountains for a nice view of the Matterhorn. Its about a 33 minute ride from Zermatt to Gornergrat. You can hike down from Gornergrat but it is a very long way. I always eat at the Walliserkanne in Zermatt. Reasonably priced good food. On the main street 5 minutes from the train station.",0,1309283554,null,0,false,0,c22ev6o,t3_ib4ns,t1_c22ev6o,t3_ib4ns,1427293777,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
true,rockenrohl,null,null,"I disagree with most of the things written down here. Skip Interlaken: It's ugly, you don't want to go there. The surrounding places up in the real hills though: Make your pick. And yes, you can have all the outdoor fun, too, but don't sleep in Interlaken. I've never understood the average American's fascination with the place. Check out Wengen, check out anything else higher up and a bit more secluded (you know: Interlaken is not even high up, so if you want the Alps, go up there.)

Züri: Yes, club scene. Yes, nice enough (I live here). But if you don't want too much international chain overload and prices that will kill you and generally a shitload of people overcrowding all the nice spots, check out Basel instead. Much more beautiful and larger medieval center, a great river (the Rhine, goes up to Rotterdam) flowing through it, and generally a more relaxed athmosphere. oh, and: far better Museums (renowned worldwide).

Luzern, yes, go there if you want postcard Switzerland. However, since everyone else, Japan und China included, is already there and blocking your view, you might as well just check out some really nice small places up in the alps instead. Or take a boat in Lucerne and go check out the Vierwaldstättersee - better than Lucerne on a hot summer day for sure.

Ticino (i.e.: Lugano etc.): Why not. Chances are it's too hot and you'd better stay north of the Alps or in the Alps in high summer.

Coming from the east: You might want to check out the Canton of Graubünden instead of heading to Bern (i.e.: Interlaken and beyond) - for any adventure sport in the book, and beauty all around. Google a bit, you will find something you like, soon. you can go to SBB.ch if traveling by train to figure out all the times and fares for all of Switzerland.

Lausanne is much more beautiful and cool than Geneva. Geneva is overcrowded and rather fierce compared to that lovely French speaking city with lots of good restaurants, bars and some clubs.",0,1309291516,null,0,false,0,c22fuzo,t3_ib4ns,t1_c22fuzo,t1_c22cmbc,1427294249,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
true,zachv,null,null,"I'm from the US and live in Switzerland. My mom came and visited for about a week and a half, and here's a list of some of the things we did. I live in St. Gallen in the east, so we didn't get over to the French part.

- [Appenzell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appenzell_(town\)) and hiking. Appenzell itself is a small little city up in the mountains near St. Gallen. It's very picturesque. We spent one day hanging out in Appenzell, and then another day hiking around the [Seealpsee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seealpsee). Appenzell is about an 1:45h - 2h from Zürich by train, since you need to get to St. Gallen first (about 1:10h) and then wait for the train to Appenzell. I'm sure there are other places you'll want to go hiking, but I really enjoyed it here. I'm not sure about the logistics (you might need to have prior training), but there are a lot of parasailers here as well. If you're coming through the east anyway, it might be worth stopping by.

- [Zürich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zürich). Switzerland's biggest city, lots to see and do. Take the [polybahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybahn) up to the universities and the outlook platform, climb up the Grossmünster for another view of the city, take the boat for a kleine Rundfahrt, visit the Swiss national museum (and others), wander through the old town, take a stroll down the [Bahnhofstrasse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahnhofstrasse), hang out in some bars / night clubs, etc.

- [Rheinfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinfall) and [Schaffhausen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaffhausen. The Rheinfall is basically the Swiss / European version of Niagara Falls. There's a big rock in the middle of the falls, and you can take a boat to get a view from the rock. It's pretty cool. Schaffhausen has an interesting old city, lots of little market squares, old architecture. There are also some museum. Also of note in Schaffhausen is the [Munot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munot), which is a big fortress built in the 16th century. From the top, you can get an interesting view of the area.

- [Luzern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzern). The old town is neat, and the bridges are also fun to look at. If you travel to the north edge of the city, you can see the old wall and some watch towers. If I recall, you can even go up on top of the wall. Luzern has two main mountains next to it, the [Pilatus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pilatus) and the [Rigi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigi). I took my mom up to see the Pilatus, but the Rigi could be nice too. It's maybe a little expensive to go up and it takes an hour or so (check sbb.ch), but it was really cool and well worth it.

- [Basel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel). Basel is a really nice town. It has a lot of museums, and a lot to do. My favorite Swiss beer comes from Basel ([Ueli Bier](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brauerei_Fischerstube)). In Basel, I would recommend touring through the old city (on both sides), climbing up the Münster, taking a ferry across the river, etc. Like Zürich, Basel is also very international, and there are a lot of bars and places to go out at night.

- [Lugano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugano). I had never been to Lugano before, but we got up early and took a train ride down there. From the train you can get some really spectacular scenery and views of the alps. Once we got to Lugano, we really just wandered around along the lake for a few hours. The food is good, and the town looks completely different from, say, Zürich. You really can feel the Italian influence. Some of my friends think that Locarno is better, but I'm sure both are great.

- [St. Gallen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St. Gallen) and [Lake Constance](http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Constance). Since I live in St. Gallen, it only made sense for my mom to the city a bit. There are a couple museums, but perhaps not the most riveting. If you come to SG (maybe other than passing through to Appenzell), take a trip to Lake Contance (Konstanz, Romanshorn, Rorschach, etc). The lake is nice. Chances are, you'll come through here if you're coming from the east.

She had a bit more time, and wasn't planning on heading down towards Interlaken, but that might give you some other ideas. Other than that, Bern is really nice, but I've never been to Interlaken. I'm sure you'll find plenty to do.

Someone else mentioned Zermatt. Zermatt is really nice, with the Matterhorn and all, but it's quite expensive. (Maybe less so in August?) My company took us there for a ski trip, otherwise I would have probably never been able to afford it. It's a really beautiful area, and the train ride down there isn't bad either, especially travelling through the Matter Valley. The town is kind of neat as well, but all in all, you can probably see mountains that are nearly as picturesque elsewhere for a lot less money and travel time.

If you want to see the countryside go to the Aargau, visit 
Baden-Wettingen or Aarau, both towns are a good example of how swiss is.
For some really stunning alp-landscape go to the Glarus, Ticino, the if you want to you can visit the Vierwaldstättersee. It's a pretty famous swiss lake, so get a boat tour and drink a beer or two near the lake.
My best advice is to visit this site
http://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays.html
its the site for the swiss railways, you can look for offers for activities and buy the train-ticket to the destination.

If you want to go into clubs here is what i think:

Luzern: Don't go into the opera, yes its cheap and free entry but the crowd is not that great.... go to the pravda if you want to go into a club in luzern.

Zürich: Depending what kind of guys you both are you can visit different clubs.
    Indochine: It's a club that can be a bit snobby yet there are really
    a lot of good-looking girls there. However its not cheap and you 
    cant enter with a t-shirt. Everybody will be able to talk english.
    Härterei: There is more of a skater snowboarder crowd there, so 
    quite relaxed and fun times i wouldn't know how good they talk 
    english over there so you would have to find that out yourself
    Kaufleuten: If you think the guys in the Indochine are snobbish 
    don't go there, and if you like the Indochine stay there. Not a good 
    club in my oppinion.
    X-tra: If you have selfrespect don't go there. The chance to have a 
    good crowd there is very low, most of the time it's 16ish girls and 
    boys, with a chance of getting stabbed or beaten  up.
    Alpenrock: It's swiss people celebrating swissness. If you want that 
    dont let me hold you back, they are nice over there but don't go 
    pissing people off, because some are farmers and they will kick your 
    ass and no bouncer can stop them.

In my opinion Zürich is the best city to party so my post about it is so long.
