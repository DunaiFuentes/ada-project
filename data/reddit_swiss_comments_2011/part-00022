If you are going there as an assistant you should ask your lab's secretary if she can help.
As a student, there should be numerous offers on campus for colocations.

First will be most useful, probably, it is a web site people use to fill rooms in shared apartments - that's where the vast majority of students in Switzerland live, not in university-owned housing.  The second site has some of that, too, and the third is for finding a place to rent, i.e., where you are the tenant, have the contract, etc (much more expensive to live alone than in a shared place).

It's a huge pain finding a place to live in Switzerland, and even more so if you are not actually here while searching.  Just expect a lot of difficult, and let it stress you out too much, you will eventually find something.

What will you be doing at EPFL?  I went there for a semester, I'm at ETHZ now, if you have any other questions about anything please ask.

Also, www.englishforum.ch has an unbelievable wealth of information about all things Switzerland-related, just search the forums, every question imaginable has been asked and answered there.

edit:  As Vlip said, secretary is also worth a try, and that reminded me that there is also some kind of EPFL list that you can ask for with a lot of places, I forgot how you get it, it's not simply posted online, I never used it but I remember some people I knew having good luck with it.",0,1304267402,null,0,false,0,c1rvlyg,t3_h1e4d,t1_c1rvlyg,t3_h1e4d,1427109461,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

That of a good place to keep your money? There is certainly a number of people out there who have this view, but they are mostly ignorants. The main factor why Swiss banks are as successful as they are, is because of the country's stability and strong economy. Yes, people put their money there because they want to hide it from the tax man, but they still pay a 35% on any derived income to the Swiss government. You can only claim this money back if you file taxes in Switzerland or in your own country (double taxation treaty).",0,1304430231,null,0,false,0,c1s7a1q,t3_h2olw,t1_c1s7a1q,t1_c1s681a,1427115028,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

An alarming number of people are not aware that what they read in these highly available papers like Blick am Abend or 20 Minuten is not news, but recycled headlines from other sources, their validity being assumed but not guaranteed. The factual situation and circumstances of a current event or context are far from being reflected in depth in such papers, the consequence of which could be a misleading coverage or in worse cases disorientating commentatorship. This leads in most cases to misinformation, misinformation that many people find to suffice. The constant availability of such papers, and especially their gratuitousness, is endangering more reliable news sources like established newspapers (NZZ, Bund, Tagesanzeiger to name a few), who now are forced to fight this trend by lowering their own standards to what people perceive as more interesting (and these days this seems to be boulevard and the sensationalism that comes with it).
