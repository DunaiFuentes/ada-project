Virgin Media are the UK's sole cable provider and they also use FTTC - the only difference between them and BT is that they use a ""TV"" cable to run the ""last mile"" - the section of line between your house and your local cabinet. They advertise about ""superfast fibre"" because they have FTTC and that's apparently enough for the advertising regulators. 

Sky, TalkTalk, Plusnet, and BT all rent connections from OpenReach - the company that owns all the infrastructure. OpenReach is owned by the BT group, which is why most people think other providers rent from BT, but due to anti-competition regulations BT Broadband is a separate company that has to rent from OpenReach on the same terms and at the same prices as any other provider. 

So at the end of the day you are using the same physical cable as you would with any other provider (unless you use Virgin), and they all have to go to OpenReach to fix any problem. In theory this means that resolution time of faults should be the same across companies, but because of BT Broadband's ""special relationship"" with OpenReach they tend to get better service, even though they shouldn't.

true,Gungunum,null,null,"This has a sombre tone gwnun, but...I hope you forgive me because I wanted to try and quantify what I feel and think for the most part. 

I...Didn't post yesterday because I spent a long, long time coming to grips with Robin Williams and death. How devoid of hope must he have been to feel he needed to leave. How bereft of love must he have felt that he believed he was so alone, despite yesterday proving conclusively that he was never, *ever* alone, and so beloved by so many. There are very few with such a blessing, and even fewer that realise that suicide, while selfish to others, is a release to him. He is at peace now, and for all the love, and joy and laughter he'd given in his incredible, *wonderful* life, I hope he finds the peace in whatever lies beyond that he couldn't find with us.

I couldn't help but feel though that I'm fucked. I suffer from similar things, and I have nowhere *near* the support base, and I spent yesterday, perhaps selfishly terrified that eventually, my demons will win. I won't be here any more, and there will be no one to mark my grave, remember the good I may have done in my life, and leave the rest in the embers where they belong. I remembered that on the times I'd been put in hospital where I'd almost done the same, when I came out there was patch adams; there was what dreams may come, and hook and jumanji. That there was mork and mindy, and that wonderful, beautiful smile who - in absence of real family and friends, were amongst the catalogue of people I look to to tell me that things will be ok - and that light is gone. It terrifies me that I have one less example to look back to.

I'm...Thinking a little more clearly now though, and I feel that I'd like to remind people to do the things that I've learned from many places; that life is beautiful. *You* are beautiful in all the forms you take, that your uniqueness is what ultimately sets you apart, and is what makes you so very wonderfully special. That life is beautiful, and despite the fact that people *like* Robin feel the need to go home, the tragedy is that they're the ones that feel and notice that more keenly than others.

Embrace the people you love, and tell them that you do at *least* once a week, if not more. Embrace life, and do one thing every day that scares you - and never forget to smile.

I come from an asian family and the second my parents found out (my own mistake for accidentally let it slip) that I literally had enough for a deposit, I was suddenly in search of a mortgage. No complaints though, aside from an occasional top up, I have renters in my flats and they're paying my mortgage for me. My advice: don't look for a property to live in, but a place that's a good investment if you can afford it, that way country doesn't matter and the british pound works in your favour.

To be honest, if you enjoy culture (live theatre, dance, art, music and etc) you'll love London. Cycling isn't as easy as Amsterdam, but as long as you're careful, plenty of people bike in London.

Moving in London is easy as you usually don't move much furniture, all the basics like beds and mattresses are usually included, you might own a bedside table or a desk or two, but you don't usually need much more than a weekend and van. Don't think that the first place you live is the last place you'll live – just make sure that the lease you sign has a 6-month break clause (quite a common thing in London), where you have the option to leave in 6 months if you don't like it. Get something central to begin with, see if it works for you, if it doesn't, then move further out. :)

And oh… look for a place in the East (E postcode), it's still cheaper than the West and has a livelier culture as it's more mixed and ethnic (if you prefer that – dunno how whitebread you are). West is more yuppies and money. East is more hipsters and graffiti artists. Walk around the Bethnal Green/Shoreditch/Hackney/Whitechapel area to get an idea of the neighbourhood.

Yeah I don't particularly enjoy former fighters being in government. As long as it keeps the radicals marginalised and quiet then I see it as worth it.

&gt; The one biggest thing that affects our government for better or for worse (mainly the worst) is religion and what side of Christianity you follow.

Religion has been more of a label for political affectation. It's been a long time since the protestant and catholic churches have encouraged sectarian behaviour.

&gt; I for one think that religion should be kicked out of the government as it makes the decision makers choose what will please their supporters, just so they can secure votes.

And just how do you propose we do that? I'm all ears.

He expects all his signings apart from poyet to make a big impact this season poyet signed for the development squad. 
He wants youth team players to break through and he named Elliot Lee and Burke as two who have a good chance, 
Aaron Creswell was asked if he knew the words to bubbles and he said no 
Vaz Te wants to play more this season and hopes for no more injuries 
Downing wants to score more and set more up.

There was under 200 people there and that looked a poor turnout as it could have held at least double that and it was free. 
No free food like at upton park and with no chair ment there either no questions about the new stadium that Sam could answer apart from we need premier league footie when we get there.

I like to hope 100 years from now we look back on this period in time with a different view.....

My partner has relapsing/remitting MS and smokes cannabis. This is of course after trying the prescription drugs, Copaxone (which nearly killed her with an anaphylactic reaction) and also Beta Interferons (yay for horrible scarring from repeated intramuscular injections and having flu-like side effects!)

So, her only treatment now is cannabis. She hasn't had a relapse in nearly 6 years and at this rate her MS will be classed as benign MS.

Is it the cannabis doing it?

I have no idea, but she can walk now without a stick, her optic neuritis has slowly over the years improved, and she is now continent. (continent is the opposite of incontinent, right?)

My point being is appears to work, and if it's not working directly it's certainly not making her condition worse. 

However, if the cops came smashing our door in to nab a wee bit of weed, I'm pretty sure the resultant court and legal proceedings with their extra side-helping of stress are going to do her MS wonders.
But because a bunch of politicians with their fingers wedged to firmly in their ear BELIEVE it's some kind of boogeyman drug making kids go insane it's gotta be banned and punished, while completely ignoring that ANY drug is a bad idea when mixed with a still-developing mind- not just cannabis.......

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;1. How do you think this season will go?

Hard to know. We've let our star striker go but we haven't squandered the money. We've made several signings including Moreno and Manquillo in the past week which for me is the most important bit of business we've done. We've added competition in every area we needed to except up front but if Sturridge can stay fit and replicate his form of the last season and a half I'm confident we can hit top 4, hopeful we can hit 2nd again and wouldn't say we're any less likely to win the title than last season.


&gt;2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why? It would help if you can put the 3 names in bold.

**Emre Can**: Has looked strong and powerful in pre-season and, if he can take his chances, has a chance of disrupting the Hendo (CM) /Gerrard (CDM) partnership. He's only 20 so there's room for improvement and it might not happen this season but when you look at the strides that Sterling made last season, you can be sure that Brendao will give him his chances.

**Javier Manquillo**: We're all hopeful that this guy can give Johnson competition for the RB spot and either make him raise his game or take the RB spot for his own. I'd be happy either way, he's only played one pre-season game against Dortmund but slotted in seamlessly with Hendo down the right. Doesn't hold back in the tackle, good going forward and looked happy to run all day and track back. We'll see if he gets his chance this season but if he impresses I'd love to see his loan move made permanent.

**Raheem Sterling**: Wasn't going to put him in because everyone's seen a lot of him already but he just keeps getting better and better. Composure, strength, pace, skill, awareness, vision.. he'll be expected to step up and contribute a few more goals to help fill in the Luis Suarez, 31 goal sized hole but the way he's started pre-season I'm not so quietly confident.

As a fiscal conservative my primary opposition is naturally going to be the cost of it. It adds multiple more levels of trials, appeals, thresholds of guilt and investment in specific mechanisms to actually kill people which all cost a whole lot of money which I would rather spend rehabilitating people who need rehabilitating or just on good old fashioned tax cuts.

As a lazy progressive it is exceptionally worrying that the weakest, least educated and most legally unaware individuals tend to be the poorest and from ethnic minorities while rich people can hire wealthy lawyers to avoid the worst penalty. This leads to racial tensions, distrust of the police and more trigger happy murderers who assume it is better to go down fighting than giving up and spending the next ten years on death row.

As a ruthless pragmatist when there are terrorists who thrive on a martyrdom complex and use it for there political ends it can prove more effective for them to be killed by the state, increasing the total level of backlash. Furthermore, there is massive amounts of evidence regarding incas aerated gang members being rehabilitated and then engaging with stoping young people being part of gangs.

As to the deterrent effect, this also has a cost. In the same way that criminals might be deterred as a consequence of the death penalty witnesses and family members with strong ties to the accused are less likely to come forward if their loved one is going to die than if they are going to go to prison. Proper life sentences are far more effective at maximising people coming forwards.

Then there is the core argument. The police have a tendency towards institutional corruption. This is exceptionally problematic now, but when the issue is innocent people who have been killed or might be killed? All the negative aspects of the modern police force would be amplified even more leading to more miscarriages of justice.

I just do not trust the police or the state enough to give them the ability or responsibility to kill people.

There are more important and better made arguments, but this has been long enough already. Feel free to ask for citations, I was too lazy to do them as I go.",0,1407920845,null,0,false,0,cjowuz2,t3_2dexm4,t1_cjowuz2,t1_cjownn8,null,1435213330,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,tomasnz,flair8,,"See I always think of Dembalee as a more physical Box to Box midfielder, which while might not always fit Poche's system, as he tends to Run with the ball well rather then pass it forward (like Holtby or Betaleb), he offers something the others don't and that is significant ball control and defensive shape. 

He excells in breaking up opposition attacks and winning the ball back either through smart tackels OR being in a great position to get an intercept, he is also very strong at holding onto the ball and very rarely spills possession (Holtby).

So for me if we assume we have Copoe/Sandro/Manson (in that order) playing DM, then the Box to Box player next to them could be either Holtby/Bentaleb/Dembalee/Paulinho. 

but where the DM order seems easier (Sandro if he is fit, Capoe if he is not), the BtB player is alot more up in the air AND lets be fair an area where we probably have 1-2 players more than we strictly need.

I'm going to ignore Paulinho as I just haven't seen him do enough for me to really understand his strengths yet - and I suspect he also represents a 3rd way from the therory I am about to propose.

this is the Controling vs Agressive axis. 

At the controlling end I think you have Dembalee, strongest in holding posession, disrupting attacks, winning the ball back, and stablising the middle

At the agressive end is Holbty. Great visionary passing forward, agressive pressing in the attacking third, lots of energy, but lets be fair sometimes prone to defensive lapses, either giving the ball away slightly too easily or being caught out of position (this last one he seems to be getting better at..).

And the Bentaleb seems to strike a mid-point between the two, good passing forward, good positional play, but neither quite as good at shutting down opposing attacks nor pressing in the attacking half.

So from this I would suggest that all three have merit and that it might prove useful to have all three in our squad and use them to slightly tweak the plans depending on the opposition. This second of the midfield pivot seems to me to be the easiest place to make minor tweaks within Poche's overall strategy/system and game plans.

Where you want to be slightly more defensively solid (say against liverpool or Man City) play the more controlling player (Dembalee), where you are trying to pick the lock of a solid side (say Stoke or Hull) play a more agressive player in holtby, and where counter attacking from behind a wall is the concern (Chelsea or West Ham) maybe Bentaleb offers a good mix of breaking the lock, without opening the door too much.",0,1407921469,null,0,false,0,cjowz6q,t3_2den4e,t1_cjowz6q,t3_2den4e,null,1435213365,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"The problem with the figures you've provided are that they only seem to account for deaths in Ireland. To get the full picture we'd need to see both deaths and injuries across all nations involved. 

That isn't to say that these figures aren't interesting. Arguably they do show that Republican Paramilitaries did kill more of the security forces than they did civilians. They also show that the British security forces killed more civilians than they did Paramilitaries. Then again they also show that the Republican Paramilitaries killed nearly 4 times as many civilians as the British Security forces and that the Loyalist Paramilitaries killed even more than that. 

Furthermore, from these figures we can see that Republican Paramilitaries apparently killed more other Republican Paramilitaries than both other groups put together, as did the Loyalists. This, if anything, demonstrates the fact that neither group of paramilitaries was made up of one single organisation. It is therefore impossible to say from the numbers alone, whether or not the IRA (for example) even targeted the Security Forces at all (they obviously did, but you couldn't say so just from the numbers). 

Therein lies the trouble with arguing either side of this point. There are and were so many separate groups operating that it is hard to say with any certainty who did what.

true,tealeg,newcr-5,,"I should, all things being equal, be an Arsenal fan.  I grew up in an area where there are literally no top-flight clubs, and my Dad was an Arsenal fan.  

The nearest clubs anyone has ever heard of would be Dover Athletic, or Brighton and Hove Albion (and when I was a kid, Brighton was a nothing team).  Even so, those two places where still a long way away, even by car.  I think I'd been to those towns about twice each before I was 16.

Anyhow, all this meant that I didn't get taken to football as a kid, so it took me a while to take an interest, and when I did it was inevitably and Arsenal game.  9th of November 1985.  Some older toffees might see that date and know where I'm going.

Now there are two things you have to understand about me. Firstly, I have always, passionately disliked the colour red, can't stand it, never could.  I loved blue, still do.  The 2nd thing is that I don't like to be told what to like.  If you tell me ""I'm an Arsenal fan, you should be to"", then my head will start thinking, ""I need to find a different club"".

So, combine that with an Everton 6 - 1 Arsenal scoreline, and you've got one 5 year old toffee.  Never looked back.  Never hated Arsenal.  I'm always glad to see my dad happy when they win.

I'd hate to see him leave, I think he's been poorly managed last season and he can show a lot more now, I would expect him to play great under Pochettino.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"The trouble is that big bang reforms don't and will never work.  They don't work for three reasons:

1. The people who actually do the reforms are the staff - 'reforms' inevitably alienate those people who see good work they've done on the ground being thrown away.  They will then lose interest in the reforms and they won't be implemented properly.
2. Doing lots of large scale changes all at once inevitably means that you don't know what has worked and what hasn't worked.  Lots of small, incremental changes work better because if something doesn't work you can isolate it more easily and roll it back.
3. 'Reforms' implies lots of large changes all at once and then leads to situations where it takes time to implement and then nothing happens for years because we think we've solved the problem.

Instead of reforms we should have a long term plan of small changes that can be prioritised based on current need that are implemented one at a time.

The other thing that we fail badly at is working out what should happen at a national level and what should happen at a local level (whatever the size of that local level is).

End of the day, the creation of the NHS was a massive task, what you (and many other people are saying that), that's it, fundamentally it structure is now fixed for all time. 

&gt;The other thing that we fail badly at is working out what should happen at a national level and what should happen at a local level (whatever the size of that local level is).

See this is the problem of the primary health care trust system in a nutshell. Fundamentally at some level the NHs has to be run, or at least funded as a first point of entry at a national level. You then have a big mess when it splits down into the Scotish/Welsh/English NHS, then a further one at the local level, because funding is utlimately competative and each trust has to make it case, before the year peroids actualy treatment that it needs X amount to do the Y it expects to do.

It's just not a very good system. IF we could link funding in something much closer to real time, by what each user of the system is needing. I think that would be MAJOR improvement and solve a range of problems.

Industrially produced with the prime focus on budget and year-round uniformity rather than taste, reheated at the premises, usually in a microwave because it's easier to give space to freezers than ovens, and train and employ chefs. The menus will pull in certain ""expected"" things from other countries' cuisines (cajun, pan-asian). When you get to ""traditional"" British food, you're looking at roasts and so on... especially when you're in a national chain, regional specialities are largely unrepresented.

Home food-wise, we have an increasing amount of people who don't cook, either because they don't know how, or they can't afford to, don't have the equipment (kitchen space in newbuild housing quite often comes with just space for a fridge, sink and microwave) or the time. Same goes with garden space for growing which is increasingly a luxury, community allotments which flourished in the war period are disappearing.

The supermarkets have pushed out a lot of traditional butchers, bakers and grocers, so getting hold of ingredients is harder than it was (compare with eg France where as well as the big hypermarkets even a small village will sometimes have more than one of each). Not to do a ""supermarkets are evil"" thing, but they do have an effect on what gets sold: on the one hand, it suits them to sell mainly prepared food because they can charge for value-added, but also their buying power has allowed them to force huge sections of producers to produce food on vanishingly small margins, and again to cost - better to have a high yield, red and round tomato than an unusual colour tomato that tastes fantastic but might not survive the harvest or produce enough. Its an unfortunate but inevitable consequence of that kind of food-chain, that the diversity of ingredients is incredibly narrow and skewed heavily in favour of other concerns than flavour.

Even our ""imported"" cuisine suffers too, there are plenty of takeaways and restaurants that are built on reheating cash-and-carry bought frozen items, or make curries built on flavouring the same uniform base rather than hand-crafting individual, authentic dishes.

So we are in this position where the mainstream food culture doesn't really celebrate what's good about the food, or when it does it's seen as a niche thing. That said, we have some of the world's top chefs and restaurants, we have some great ingredients where they can be found (small producers selling seasonal ingredients to markets or farmers markets, farm shops) and there are still a lot of people that make their own food. What it does mean is that for, say, a foreigner coming across and comparing what's available, our good food is more difficult to find, or priced out of budget because of the realities of how it was made. So we have this reputation for ""bad food"", and I think on balance the answer is a ""yes, but..."" sort of thing. The good food is definitely there, it's just harder to find unless you actively seek it out.",0,1407923711,null,0,false,0,cjoxec4,t3_2de78l,t1_cjoxec4,t3_2de78l,null,1435213512,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Well again, I think the problem comes down to a lack of a proper mechanical understanding of what the pathology of the problem is. Whether or not their is a particularly rich spectrum between 'light' depression and the cases we are really talking about is an open question.

Also whilst I imagine people do abuse it to get out of work (everyone can probably think of one case, I can). Again the problems here come from the lack fo the same hard diagnostic criteria that other pathologies can have. You can't for example prove with much objectivity that you have depression like you can prove that you have lyme disease.

I've never taken the time to study enough poetry and I'm not really sure why because it can lift your feet from the ground with exhilaration at times; at others it's just pretentious trying-too-hard bollocks. Poetry as an art form is especially guilty of veering towards the latter too often.

Dear old Radio 4 has a terrible habit of poetry-ising as they seem to be overly fond of hiring voice talent with special poetry-intoning voices who employ that clichéd poetry drone that is supposed to tell you ""Hey, this is poetry! You should thank me for making you more edumacated and sophisticated!"" Bullshit, a good poem stands tall on its own content, not because some fucking luvvie is ploddingly overemphasising the meter and emoting like their life depended on it.

Great poetry lies somewhere between William Shakespeare, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Edward Lear, John Hegley, T.S. Eliot, John Keats, and Samuel Butler.

For the purposes of the NHS services themselves, it is irrelevant how you fund them, as long as the service itself is free at the point of service.  As it is, NHS funding comes out of general taxation.  If you replace that, but keep things free at the point of service, then all you are doing is changing the way the taxation works.  Mostly our tax is a progressive system at the moment (given about half of it comes from income tax).  If you are suggesting that funding for it needs to be less progressive, I don't think you'll win many backers.

&gt;  IF we could link funding in something much closer to real time, by what each user of the system is needing. I think that would be MAJOR improvement and solve a range of problems

This is one of the fatal problems of the way that we do things - we just shift where the decisions are made, rather than how they are made.  Any system that can be tweaked at a local level is far more likely to get things like that implemented because each risk of failure (ie something costs more or doesn't have improved patient outcomes) is smaller.  As it is, the same decisions are made at a different level each time.  How are Health England going to be able to do these things when the local NHS authorities couldn't?

'Reform' is just another way for government to say I want to change something so it looks like I've done something to the public.

That's why reform doesn't work and why more autonomy at a local level does work.  It's the same reason that privatised hospitals work more efficiently - they don't have to play by the same rules.

Sugar is the killer and it's in everything.

Take a look at a typical can of baked beans and see how much sugar is in there. Even more so on the cheap stuff that is usually used from catering tins. Sugar activates your insulin production and that tells your body to stop burning fat and to start storing it.

If it's the beans are good quality without so much sugar then it's a good food source with lots of fibre and protein but you don't find that in the shops, you have to make it yourself.

Bacon and sausages on the other hand are basically just protein and fat. If you aren't eating sugar then your body won't be storing the fat. You can eat fat and protein all damn day and lose weight if you just cut the sugar out.

Sell Townsend? Why? Under a manager who has done wonders with young, talented but raw players in the past, Townsend is definitely capable of something.
Lennon, one, if not our only, consistent performers in recent years. Not spectacular but you're team is not going to be full of Bale's/Eriksen'.
Depay has no PL experience and will take time to settle and won't guarantee an immediate upgrade.

Sell Capoue, Dembele, Sandro? Capoue and Sandro both had injury ravaged seasons but otherwise looked good. Capoue, I feel, didn't show his full potential but there were glimpses of greatness.
Dembele, has so many strings to his bow. Strong, quick, decent shot on him, if we can keep him fit can be an excellent player.
Sandro, we all now can be spectacular.

Soldado and Chadli, disappointing seasons granted but working in a system geared to high tempo and attacking, I think these two will look a damn lot better.

The only people there we should realistically be looking to sell are Dawson (who I'd be sad to see go), Ekotto and Chiriches. We can't sell Naughton with Walker's injury looking as bad as it is.

I know this article is probably a load of wank but the speed at which everyone jumps on the fbandwagon is ridiculous.

The more sugar you eat, the more insulin you will produce and the more fat you will store.

Over the past few decades we have eaten less fat than we used to yet we still continue to get fatter and diabetes is a growing epidemic. That's because everything you buy these days is full of sugar.

Do you mean why is favouring the innocent more important than punishing the guilty? Personally I don't have a good answer for that. It is one area where the various systems of ethics disagree. There are arguments for it but nothing convincing enough to close the topic.

However if somebody honestly disagrees with Blackstone's Formulation we are so far apart ethically that it is not possible to hold a debate the topic on this basis. Your entire view of justice is so disjoint from mine that nothing can be concluded other than we disagree on everything.

I don't think ethically we are required to convince everyone on the fundamentals.

I had to have a minor operation as a teenager, and was fortunate that my dad's job provided him with health insurance for the whole family.

If you don't do this then any change will fail because you don't know if it actually works and staff will just end up ignoring the orders and doing whatever they think is best.

This all started with the madness of internal markets and is continuing with the procurement of private services by a public health provider. Then the banking sector arranged loans it couldn't afford to pay back, in the form of PFIs, by over inflating the cost benefits of new services (this is a classic economic play). Now they're introducing privatised systems that provide the same services but offer less bartering power for the NHS because trusts have been broken up into smaller chunks. 

The introduction of privatisation being a good thing goes almost entirely criticised by its supporters, free market interventions are never questioned and never criticised. Personally, I think the NHS staff are well trained and dedicated individuals capable of seeing through the bullshit but they are given almost no organisational power as a consequence of bureaucracy that relates to ownership.",0,1407927596,null,0,false,0,cjoy5pd,t3_2df46v,t1_cjoy5pd,t1_cjowhwa,null,1435213851,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,newb0rn11,,Lewis Cook is fucking brilliant,"Here's a few things I noticed from the match last night:

* Smith, Doukara and Ajose worked really well up front together. Doukara and Ajose came short to collect the ball from the midfield, then looked to lay it off to Taylor/Berardi on the wings, who would then look for Smith in the centre. Good system, Smith always looked dangerous and won just about every challenge that came his way. We were able to switch this around by having Smith knock the ball on to Doukara and Ajose running in behind off long balls. Good stuff. I'd start them against Boro on Saturday.

* Tonge, Cook and Bianchi impressed massively in the midfield. All three looked composed under pressure, and were constantly looking to receive the ball from the defence. You have to give Hock credit, it's been a hell of a long time since I've seen Leeds play effective possession football in midfield. Great to see Tonge back to his best, Bianchi is obviously talented, and Cook is going to be absolutely class if he carries on like this.

* The back 4 were less impressive overall. Pearce is obviously the best option we have, but he was *very* physical last night, and he runs the risk of getting turned by quicker, more intelligent strikers if he continues to get so tight to the last man. Wootton was okay, but against stronger attacks he's going to struggle if stays as flat-footed as he was (see their goal for evidence). Berardi and Taylor were good going forward, fairly solid at the back, but a little rough around the edges. I think the red card was kind of harsh, but I understand why it was given. There was no need to go for that scissor-kick clearance, and the reaction of their player convinced the ref to send him off.

* **SUBS:** Hunt was garbage. Might sound harsh, but he did *nothing* when he came on apart from knock the ball out of play a few times with his first touch. Benedicic wants to get the ball at his feet, but he ran himself into trouble a few times and needs to look for the easier option more often. Poleon did what was expected and ran like a madman, including a fantastic piece of ball retention on the edge of the area.

* Overall, a solid first half performance, Doukara was fantastic throughout. However, that last 10 minutes was pathetic. All the hard work and possession play completely fell apart in a section of the game that Hockaday has insisted was going to be our strongest point with all this fitness training. The officials didn't help with some shitty decisions, and Berardi lost his head for no reason, but that doesn't excuse how hard the team made it for themselves against poor opposition. Better teams will tear us apart given the same chance. ",0,1407927754,null,0,false,0,cjoy6ta,t3_2dcurs,t1_cjoy6ta,t3_2dcurs,null,1435213880,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

I'm just saying, with reference to op's initial question, that the Mountbatten killing had significant tactical and propaganda advantages and he was obviously a political target in the way that drinkers and shoppers were not.

In the logic of military operations, that we have been forced to accept with regards to Iraq and Afghanistan amongst other places, the elimination of high value targets sometimes comes with margins of error in which acceptable levels of ""collateral damage"" are permissible in pursuit of a tactical or strategic goal.

To my mind, and to yours also, this highlights the moral vacancy of the venture but I would think that if that were someone's mindset they wouldn't be arguing that the IRA hit mainly military and political targets on the internet in the first place.",0,1407929774,null,0,1407933709,0,cjoymhs,t3_2devgm,t1_cjoymhs,t1_cjoyfzo,null,1435214168,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

As you say, due to the law cannabis isn't the easiest thing to obtain on a regular basis. I used to know some really good people online who would send it out; you may have heard of thc4ms who used to make cannabis chocolate for therapeutic use, but they were busted and shut down.

There was also Medical Marijuana Today, a site run by a lovely guy who had MD and terminal stomach cancer who also grew cannabis and sent it by post to those who needed it (as long as you provided a letter of proof of illness from your doctor)

Sadly the guy running it died and the site is long-gone.

For anyone that doesn't believe me, from the report itself,

&gt;Looking at men and women working full-time and part-time, between April to June 2013 and
April to June 2014, Chart 1.3 shows that:

&gt; • the number of men working full-time increased by 469,000 to reach 14.27 million,

&gt; • the number of men working part-time was little changed at 2.10 million,

&gt; • the number of women working full-time increased by 223,000 to reach 8.13 million, and

&gt; • the number of women working part-time increased by 132,000 to reach 6.09 million.

I guess he will add depth, and he can play out wide and down the middle in a 4-3-3, which is where we need to strengthen our squad.

true,CheeseMeUp,null,null,"Ah dude you've invested too heavily in defence. For me, defenders have a certain level of value. You get more if you pay more, yes, but they still will not send you to giddy stratospheres. My view is to get really good value in defence (those that are undervalued), then to try and make room for the guys that will really get the big points. Of course it's hard to tell at this point in the season, but i'm basing my opinion on the last few years. Here's my team:

GK:   Foster, Krul
DEF: Debuchy, Davies (Ben), Chester, Van Aanholt, Hutton
MID: Fabregas, Mata, Ramsey, Sterling, Albrighton
ATT: Rooney, Costa, Bojan

My reasoning: These keepers are fairly solid, though i'm happy to switch for any similarly priced starting keeper. Arsenal had 2 of top 10 defenders last season and most of their defenders finished on more than 5.5 - I forsee an increase in value. If Davies is first choice and Poch performs the sort of defensive miracles with spurs that he did with southampton, then he'll score well. Added bonus that they play a similar system. Chester and Van Aanholt because they are likely starters in decent defences. Hutton (although I dislike him) because of price and posibility of starting.

Midfield i've gone for proven point scorers plus sterling and albrighton. Up top all of these three have had very good preseasons.",0,1407930523,null,0,false,0,cjoysp8,t3_2ddn81,t1_cjoysp8,t3_2ddn81,null,1435214219,3,false,avfc,t5_2s569,3

Would there be much difference between A level IT and BTEC IT? I mean apart from exams and coursework.

I'm looking at the different courses that they offer for IT, and the BTECs are more about how to install software, update systems and stuff.

&gt; • the number of men working full-time increased by 469,000 to reach 14.27 million,

&gt;• the number of men working part-time was little changed at 2.10 million,

&gt;• the number of women working full-time increased by 223,000 to reach 8.13 million, and

&gt;• the number of women working part-time increased by 132,000 to reach 6.09 million.

So thats a total increase in full time jobs of 692,000 and 132,000 for part time.

Bielsa's greatest sucess was the transformation of the Chilean national side, and all his teams are characterised with systems for how they transition between losing and gaining possession. 

That system's varriant that we associate with Poche is the 'high press'.

There are lots of good articles and blogposts on this so rather than links I am going to suggest punching combinations of these search words into google, and you will find LOTS of information about Bielsa, his style and how Pochettino has applied it at southhampton and Espanyol.

W1 means you get paid weekly, and this is an emergency tax code. The 1000L means your annual tax allowance is £10,000 (the numeric part of the code, multiplied by 10 - W1 is not part of the code for the purpose of working out your allowance).

Because it's an emergency code, they will pro-rata your allowance for the remainder of the year - because we're about 1/3 of the way through the tax year, they assume you've already used around 1/3 of your allowance at a previous job, and so they've allowed you only about 2/3 of your £10,000 allowance.

This - together with the fact that £10,000 may not even be the correct allowance for you - probably explains why you're paying more tax than you ought to be. But it will sort itself out once you've got the correct tax code. If, by some remote chance, you don't have the correct tax code by April, you can either claim it back from HMRC, or you can have your tax code for next year adjusted to take into account your overpayment.

Long balls on the ground would be the tinkering Poch seems to have incorporated towards attack.

So what we have is:

Defensive: pressing high up the field as a unit

Transition to attack: long balls up the field (above)

Attack: wing backs creating space, wingers cutting in for short passes in the final 3rd, CAM the true playmaker with support from CMs

Transition to defense: there seems to be enough time for everyone to get back following an attack, which means shots on goal or corners, or ball retention.

Connections is a different matter.

I'm not sure that's the case. If we were to intervene in the civil war, we would've undoubtedly been on the side of the rebels - of which many are part of IS or fighting with IS against Assad now. (Unless of course we had troops on the ground in a 'peacekeeping' capacity - which may have worked but could equally have been a disaster.)

During this recovery and in fact the recession itself the UK had remarkably low unemployment compared to many other countries and historic recessions. This was predominately thanks to very low wage growth. Unemployment is now reaching a level where wages will have to rise as the spare capacity is removed from the workforce and I would expect to see that start to happen in the next couple of quarters.

Low unemployment through the recession and recovery is definitely preferable due to the social effects of unemployment and the long term damage being long term unemployed does to peoples future careers.

I've looked into one bedroom flats, but at the absolute minimum they're about £450 a month, and that's just for the property alone!

This is around the city centre though, to be fair, so I'm not sure what it would be like a little further outside of town, probably not too much less to be honest. There's also the social aspect of it. The last two (and only two) times I've found a flatmate through there, I've become best mates with them.

Tips? Pick very carefully. View any property that you are interested in, and make sure you read any paperwork you're signing. If you're moving in with a flatmate, try and go out with them a few times. Maybe a coffee or a few pints or something, just to get to know them a bit better. It can help it be a bit less awkward at first, well, maybe not awkward but y'know what I mean? Haha.

That's it in a nutshell but it doesn't answer your question. For that we have to look at the roles of each position. I think this where the brilliance of Poch's system really shows (and what Timmy was lacking). 

First the goalkeeper. As you've noticed from our previous implementation of the pressing game, it means having a high back line. In turn, this means your goalkeeper has to be ready to come running off the line should a ball come somewhere between him and the CBs where if the CBs track back, we place ourselves in danger. Lloris' already got this down but what he needs to change is his passing game. In Poch's system, the plays begin at the back and the keeper should be comfortable passing. Lloris is capable of fiting in this system, but it leads me to the next role. 

CBs function differently under Poch, and Dawson might be a casualty of the regime change. First, like the keeper, CBs are expected to build from the back, so passing (not one of Dawson's strengths) is a crucial skill. Next, instead of placing 2 CBs in the center, Poch splits them a bit wide. The goal is to shepard attacks to the flanks. As I will explain later, the center midfield will be overloaded in the center, meaning our opponents will need to come at our goal from the sides. This is why you want your two CBs split up a bit. However, since they are covering a way larger area, speed is critical to survive counters (an even bigger weakness of Dawson). For this reason I think Chiriches can be a huge success with this new system, he just need a leader as his partner to organize the back and keep him focused. The full backs perform similar duties like we're used to, but keep in mind, Poch uses them more than anyone for width. 

As I said, the central midfield should be overloaded to push attackers to come in from the flanks. To do this, he fields two pivots (CDMs) that play different roles. One CDM plays the role of the DM, screening the back 4 and disrupting incoming plays. What makes his role different I'm this system is his positioning. When the CBs split, he moves in between them and ahead of them. This serves two purposes. One, it creates less room for our CBs to track back to. Two, he is a release valve for passes going forward and backwards (He is in the center/middle of the pitch). As such he needs to be able to also pass the ball and move it with him some distance. It's Sandro's passing skills that are making some wonder if he'll fit in this new Tottenham. 

The other CDM of this of this pivot is the Box-to-Box midfielder. Here we would expect to see either Paulinho, Dembele, and as of now, we've seen Holtby when he's not playing the #10. Their job is 50% offense, 50% defense. Also, they are supposed to help fill in for whichever full back is the most offensive minded. In Southampton, Schneiderlin filled in for Shaw when he want up the pitch. For us, we've seen Holtby go back for Rose and I imagine we'll see Paulinho for Walker and Dembele for Davie/Rose. People say the Paulinho and Dembele are too slow for this role and I say Holtby is not disciplined enough to be one of the pivots (great #10 though). To be honest, given Schneiderlin's price tag, I think we'll have to stick with our current options to see.

The next row of midfield consists of our dynamic players. It could be Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli, Lennon, Chadli, Holtby, Townsend, and Kane and Soldado if we want secondary strikers when we play against weaker sides which will take more defensive approaches when facing a quality opponent implementing a pressing/high-line strategy. Since any number of players can fill these 3 slots, this formation gives Pochettino a lot of tools at his disposal as to how he wants to approach the attack. Want to leave the defense eating your dust and send crosses into the box for Adebayor to put away into the net? Put Townsend and Lennon on the wings with Holtby sending in some amazing vertical balls to our speedsters. What about a dynamic strike force? Put in Eriksen as your playmaker with Lamela and Chadli as your inverted wingers to create multiple goal threats along with a linking Soldado. The beauty of this is how many options you have. Here we have no problems, we might just need more quality on the LW/LM since Chadli hasn't lived up to expectations for a club wanting Top 4 and we don't want to waste Eriksen on the left, especially since they have to track back. But it seems that Lennon has been playing on the left in the pre-season.

The striker is pretty much the same. Put away chances. The only difference is that they will occasionally drop back to hold up the play and open up the opposition for the wide forward or the #10. As we have seen, Soldado is more than capable than doing this while he is looking to rediscover his scoring instinct. Adebayor and Kane with their height and strength are great target men, capable of reaching long balls and bringing them down for teamates to use more clinically. Again, not much controversy here other than Soldado might not come good and Adebayor might have yet another drop in form - therefore us not having enough fire power to challenge for a CL birth. I'd argue, however, that with Lamela, Eriksen, Holtby, Adebayor on his day, Soldado on his day, and Kane coming up, we should be well equipped.

 His style is focused on attacking. Hence the the high pressure, winning ball back early is to fuel the attack and create counters and more scoring opportunities. 

Another thing to note is the importance of the CDM. He sees it as the link between defense and offense and is crucial in starting the attacks. Once the ball is won back in our defensive half, the CDM needs to find an outlet pass to stretch the ball out wide or to catch the opponents defense unprepared. The CDM needs to be a great ball winner as well as a great distributor. Schneiderlein excelled under Poch last season and Capoue could be the man this year.

My course was system support and networking which is what you're trying to avoid but I just looked up my old college and they do a course called  Edexcel BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in IT (Software Development) which is probably what you want to be looking for when applying for a college, although my first job was actually trainee software support, generally if you have any type of IT qualification you can get taken on as a trainee in any branch of IT if you change your mind when you're out of college.

In terms of what other courses you could take with that I can't give you any advice i'm afraid, I don't know enough about the different types of subjects in A levels and I wouldn't want to give you any bad advice.

Just make sure you take a course that you have a good interest in, because you've got 2 years of it ahead of you and a mountain of coursework (but plenty of partying too).

Hadn't the primary care trusts been in place for less than a decade by the time Andrew Lansley decided to get rid of them?  It has been [forcefully argued](http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c3843.full) that the main structural problem with the NHS is that its structure keeps radically changing, often for political reasons and with no concrete goals.

We could have a brainstorming session and come up with thousands of different ways of implementing a universal healthcare system.  The problem is, it's very difficult to produce evidence showing that one system works better than another, even if you try them both out.  Imagine that we switched to an insurance-based system a couple of years ago, we are now spending more on healthcare, and public health measures have worsened.  Is that because insurance-based systems are fundamentally a bad idea, or because there are issues with the details of the system we picked, or because there are teething problems and the long-term benefits haven't kicked in yet, or is it just because people have got older and are leading less healthy lifestyles?  Governments generally haven't even tried to measure the benefits or drawbacks of major reorganisations of public bodies, because nobody wants to be put in the position of having to announce that important policies have failed.

He's a decent leader, which Skrtel obviously seems to require, this has helped the Skrtel/Agger team somewhat. With Lovren, and a young Sakho presumably growing in confidence and stature at the club, I think Agger will be surpassed as a leader of the defense.

Right now, Skrtel and Lovren seem like they're tailormade for each other. Both are strong, and Lovren is able to command the defense. Skrtel and Sakho would also be a great pairing in theory, but Sakho hasn't really showed his dominant side yet, so they haven't been effective together. I rate Sakho above Skrtel, but we still don't know how a Lovren/Sakho pairing would work.

Skrtel/Lovren: :-D
Skrtel/Sakho: :-|
Skrtel: Agger: :-)
Sakho/Agger: ? (probably bad)
Sakho/Lovren: ? (probably good)
Agger/Lovren: ? (probably okay)

true,Melancholicdrunk,null,null,"It's a public service. Like other public service workers they should care about their jobs. I don't think the argument that they'll go off to private business is a good one. We don't pay people who risk their lives every day (eg firefighters) millions of pounds because we think they'll run off to do something easier and better paid. We expect them to care enough to do it.

I suggest they are given housing in their constituency and bed and board when in London. No rent or mortgages to pay then. Rather than expenses where they put receipts in they could do it like my work does where you apply for train tickets in advance and they are bought for you. Then there's no retrospective fiddling.
Without rent/mortgages or transport their wages could then be just for food and leisure, which would save a lot of money. Even if we're saying they could have more than everyone else for food and free time it'd be what? £500 a week?
Then it'd ensure they're not living in mansions, they're not fiddling expenses, you might get people who care about their jobs and the people they work for a bit.

You'd have to have lived in your constituency for at least two years and you'd have to spend at least four nights a week in your home in your constituency (after all, that's what they demand if you want to claim housing benefit).

Oh, and I'd also have rules saying while they're serving they aren't allowed any shares or interests in any companies. They aren't allowed access to personal or family fortunes, and their housing standards are linked to average standards in their constituency. Give them an incentive to work for the people they're meant to.

As for pensions, if you've got a personal fortune to live off, you get no pension. If you don't you get a lifelong public sector pension from when you're no longer elected (unless of course there's been some scandal involving shares or future lucrative job offers from private companies).

You should have relevant experience for your post. Every MP would have to have worked in some other job or claimed jobseekers allowance for at least two years. This means fewer career politicians and the cabinet would be more representative of the country. 
To be in the cabinet you'd need representative experience. To have worked in that field for at least two years. Education secretary to have been a teaching assistant, teacher or other relevant things etc. To be work and pensions secretary you'd need to have claimed job seekers allowance (this has the double whammy of experience and ensuring the person isn't a millionaire who will never have to worry about their personal circumstances). Health secretary, nurse, doctor, bed manager etc for at least two years. You get the idea.

The fee for standing for parliament would be means tested. So if you have no money in the bank it's free. Gradually increasing to large amounts.
This would mean there's not that initial financial barrier most people face, and also that it's not a flippant, easy decision for people with money.

I know some people will say ""ooooh, but whoever from down the jobcentre wouldn't be qualified"", that'd be up to their constituents to decide. ",0,1407934880,null,0,false,0,cjp029z,t3_2dcljj,t1_cjp029z,t3_2dcljj,null,1435214716,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,LordMondando,null,null,"&gt;Hadn't the primary care trusts been in place for less than a decade by the time Andrew Lansley decided to get rid of them? It has been forcefully argued that the main structural problem with the NHS is that its structure keeps radically changing, often for political reasons and with no concrete goals.

Previous attempts at reform being fucked, does not thereby make all reform fucked in principle. 

&gt;We could have a brainstorming session and come up with thousands of different ways of implementing a universal healthcare system. The problem is, it's very difficult to produce evidence showing that one system works better than another, even if you try them both out. Imagine that we switched to an insurance-based system a couple of years ago, we are now spending more on healthcare, and public health measures have worsened. Is that because insurance-based systems are fundamentally a bad idea, or because there are issues with the details of the system we picked, or because there are teething problems and the long-term benefits haven't kicked in yet, or is it just because people have got older and are leading less healthy lifestyles? Governments generally haven't even tried to measure the benefits or drawbacks of major reorganisations of public bodies, because nobody wants to be put in the position of having to announce that important policies have failed.

I'm not pretending to have a proper scientific argument here, such is impossible, unless we set up a country just to field test policy ideas. 

My point is though, that there is a fundmental proble in the a spesific aspect of the current system, from which problems often arise. That needs have to follow funding, often well in advance, as opposed to funding following needs. 

This is one aspect that German and France have over us, and nets a series of benefits from speeder access to better localised funding. IT's one aspect we should copy. 

&gt;I can imagine that making administration more complicated,

Speaking as a junior software and database engineer, so long as you don't go down the 'lowest bidder' route and hire fucktards, you could actually have a automated system that would require a huge amount *less* adminstration. Fundamentally its not some new world of complexity from how say oyster card works.

As it is, the same decisions are made at a different level each time. How are Health England going to be able to do these things when the local NHS authorities couldn't?

On the other hand, when decisions are made at a higher level, you get economies of scale, and fewer problems caused by people moving from one area to another.  Certain things, like public health campaigns and outbreaks of rare diseases, have to be dealt with at a pretty high level anyway (unless you think every village should have its own anti-smoking TV ads and ebola experts).

There is a free HTML5 framework called Phaser, which has loads of example apps you can study and modify to give you a head start. There are a lot of other frameworks, Phaser just seems like one of the better ones.

Get vocal in the communities that exist and try and score a job that way. It will be hard work and can be quite daunting but it is a viable way in to the industry.

true,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"You're going to be seeing military aircraft more often in the lakes, it's often used for low level flight training, if you don't live near any sort of military base then your not going to be used to it, but that doesn't mean it's uncommon in your current location. Where do you normally live, perhaps we could explain why you're noticing more aircraft than usual? The summer months are air show season, so perhaps it's that.

I live in North Wales, home to RAF Valley, a fairly major RAF station which provides fast jet training to all RAF pilots. But it's not uncommon to see other aircraft such as Hercules and even the USAF playing around in the mountains.
Seeing low flying aircraft around here is as common as muck, when it's not blowing the usual 25mph winds you'll hear the roar of aircraft almost every single day.
But I can't say I've noticed anything different in terms of activity at all. 

North Wales is also obviously a big tourist destination, when I used to take orders at a cafe as a summer job people would often ask me if it was normal to see Hercules or a a couple Hawks flying a few hundred hundred feet off the Menai Straits.

And..

&gt;Around two-fifths of all new jobs since 2010 have been among the self-employed, a trend that has triggered debate over the strength of the recovery and helped shape Labour's cost-of-living agenda.

School advice for students picking A-Levels is often poor or non-existent, so even students perfectly capable of getting into good universities end up doing the wrong subjects or ""soft"" A-Levels which means they get screwed when it comes to university admission.

Schools often give poor advice as they don't want to say ""subject X is better than Y"" due to internal politics and because it's in their interest to have students doing easier A-Levels (because the grades are what matter in league tables regardless of subject).

It's also worthing noting that well-off students from state schools have higher admissions into good universities than worse-off students at the same school. And it's not just about the money, social capital is also very important. Poorer students will often not know any adults socially who went to a good university who can give them advice while better-off students will often be surrounded by such people (parents, family friends, etc.).

A lot of people seemed obsessed by the fees argument but it's largely irrelevant here.

The first one being that 'free' is the default state of life in this world - laws are created by man and by their nature restrict what man can and can't do. You would have to convert the whole of society into a slave society in order to be able to control the level of freedom to the point that punishment is meted out essentially for not obeying.

The second one is a more practical one - if you simply lock up or hang the most convenient suspect without due process to establish whether they are in fact guilty - then by logical inference, you are letting the actual guilty party go free... to commit more crimes, or at least breed a healthy disrespect for the law and the life of others.

What if some people got very good at covering their tracks and framing others... an entire underworld industry might gain an economic boost. How easy would it be to get away with murder if the authorities didn't see the need to perform the basic tests that are needed to ensure someone's guilt?

In fact the law becomes arbitrary because the point of the law is to identify an act or behavior is wrong - if you aren't concerned with righting the wrong - only punishing someone for it, then why bother having a law in the first place?

It does raise a good point though. Yesterday my Facebook feed (and indeed a lot of Reddit) was awash with pictures of the Genie from Aladdin and other tributes to R.Williams. 

All this from people who in all likelihood never really knew the man. My friends on Facebook in particular - who knew him? Who had *any* connection to him beyond having seen him on a screen? 

That's not to say his passing isn't sad, but I’m not entirely sure what pushes someone to jump on the bandwagon of posting their own heartfelt picture / message etc. in honour of whoever has recently passed away. It’s fair enough to reiterate that you’re sad at someone’s passing, but there’s almost this competitive edge to be the *most* grieving person or post the *most* heartfelt message / image etc. 

Perhaps there’s something cathartic in shared grieving or in allowing ones emotions to wallow in pity and sorrow for a bit – rather like when you’re really sad and decide ‘screw it all, I’m going to see just how sad I can make myself, I’m really going to plumb the depths of my own sadness here’ – rather than thinking ‘oh, I’m a bit sad – better cheer myself up’. 

I may be rambling… but the short version is that I agree. It’s not insensitive to comment on this and I don’t understand why so many of my friends who never knew this man (who will in all likelihood never see or know of their Facebook posts) climb over themselves to post the most sincere message about a strangers passing.

Workfare / skills courses suffers from the same problem too, as these schemes aren't reported seperately from a regular 9-5 job in the LFS.

Since there's been a perception by many that in the past 6 years since the GFC that there's been an increase in workfare, 'skills courses', and zero hours contracts, when they are all lumped in with regular employment for reporting purposes people are cynical.

To give one example, in the last year there was a significant fall in youth unemployment, which is regularly defined as 16-25 NEETs. However in the last year we made it illegal to be an under 18 NEET, so if you don't have a job lined up at 16 you have to stay in school.

So the issue is that headline figures aren't nuanced enough usually to explain the smaller 'unmeasured' effects. Especially when you look at other metrics such as productivity which is falling, it seems we as a nation are 'working harder, not smarter'.

What would be better is to have more accessible and more in depth data analytics instead of topline numbers. But I suspect this would make it easier for opponents of the government to do a quick analysis to see where the areas for improvement are.

But it has not issued a penalty, saying the company has assured it the problem has been addressed.

Learn the old code, learn the history of computer programming. It will be very good for bragging rights when people start asking what languages you know.

I know that if you want a job in a major company they usually look for Perl, C++ , Java, Ruby etc. It's also good to know all linux commands like the back of your hand and the advantages of different distros. You will be working on different enviroments to make sure your code works so it is best to get to learn all the distros and if your code will work across all of them. OR at least the most popular, (Debian, centos, etc)

Keep at it and you will do well. If you find that you cant be bothered within the week you are better just giving up. Programming is a life long thing. It will take years of practise and years to build a portfolio. Best of luck to you man if you have any questions feel free to ask.

true,FinalEdit,null,null,"I grew up as a massive fan of Pantera. When Dimebag Darrell was shot and killed on stage (a bit before the days of facebook in 2004), I was devastated. Here was a guy I'd idolised, and modelled and respected since I was a wee boy. Before that I never understood why people feel the need to say this kinda shit publicly, I always silently mocked fans of Kurt Cobain when they were doing the same thing.

Then Dime was shot and I realised what a hole he would leave in not just my CD collection, but in my influences as a (albeit hobbyist) musician. I was angry at the senseless murder, and I was distraught that the genre of music I loved was so affected.

People felt the same when John Lennon died. As for RW, well I guess his movies provided a lot of joy to people when they were kids, and his death probably leaves them feeling similarly.

At the time of Dime's death there was a huge outpouring of grief on web boards, at gigs, etc etc - I didn't feel at the time that this was particularly wrong or outlandish. Personally I never really cared one way or the other about RW's films and comedy, but if people found real value in what he did with his work, then I feel a bit weird complaining that there's an outpouring of grief, because when the same thing happened to me, I felt compelled in the same way. It's just that with social media so prevalent nowdays, the lines of communication are so much stronger between people that it's easier to get bogged down in nothing but ""RIP"" posts. It's the news that bothers me, covering the story all day whilst other more important things are going on.

I never met Dime, I never worked with him or had any connection to him beyond his music. The same is said for probably 99% of everyone who posted about RW yesterday. But that to me isn't reason for accusing everyone of being shallow, or proclaiming that they shouldn't feel anything. Certain artists touch people emotionally, through their work, and that for me is enough to feel genuinely upset at the loss of such a person.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Looks like you're roughly at 3-4x your income. Not horrendous IMO.

A return to 8% interest rates is unlikely anytime SOON (I.e next 3-5 years). 

Although a 35 year mortgage is pretty unusual - a 2.2% rate is v good.

If I were you I would fix now for 5 years (we did recently) - with a view to re fixing in 3-4 years before rates go sky high. If I can refix for another 5 years in 2017/18 at 4-5% - I'll be fairly pleased.

Are you also not expecting your income to rise ? When we bought (very similar mortgage, deposit and salaries) we thought I a similar vein - our household income was 45k and we worried. It's now approaching 100 only 3 years later.  Given the mortgage length I'll assume you're very young - so your earning power should increase.

Bear in mind also, your 230k mortgage will be slightly less in 2 years, and less in 5 years, making higher interest payments more affordable once you rejig. 

Politically, it's unlikely the base rate will budge from 0.5 until after the GE next year. Then after that the consensus is for slow and steady increases. You can safely expect 1-2% by the time you come out of your fix in 2 years.

Longer term, it's anyone's guess - and Over a 35 year mortgage, it's Highly likely you'll see high rates. During those periods, dip into savings, tighten belts, and plan for them during good times. 

Overall, your mortgage isn't huge for your income, and id be more worried about losing your partners salary if you had kids over interest rate rises! 

Final thoughts;

Owning a house is expensive. Over the past few years we've pumped everything back into it. We've laughed, cried, fought and hated and loved our house in equal measure. It remains the best purchase I've ever made and is the biggest consistent thing our lives. It's made us more grounded, more adult, it  sounds great at interviews, and overall is just an absolutely amazing rite of passage almost.

1. How do you think this season will go?
The season will be better due to our summer transfers, we rectified our striker problems (for now) with Diego Costa leading the attack and we bolstered our defense with the addition of Felipe Luis. We also brought in Fabregas who is a creator for a great poacher like Diego Costa.

2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why? It would help if you can put the 3 names in bold.

**Eden Hazard**- Simply put, the best player on our squad and will mostly impact the team in every way with his speed and his abilities. Need him to do well if we are to win any trophies this year.

**Diego Costa**- The new star striker at Stamford Bridge, he is a big upgrade from our strikers last year (Torres, Ba, Eto'o). We lacked finishers last year and Costa is a star poacher, knows where to be at the right time.

**Cesc' Fabregas**- He is the new creator of the team, he will need to get forward and create opportunities for Diego Costa, yet he is also a deadly scoring option.

I guess so, yes. And also that professional writers should strive for accuracy (I can hear hollow laughter as I type). Definition III of ""commit"" in the OED, which is the most relevant definition, is ""To perpetrate or perform (in a bad sense)""; ""To do (something wrong or reprehensible); to perpetrate, be guilty of (a crime, offence, etc.)."" ""(a folly, an error, etc.)""; ""To commit an offence, offend; to commit adultery or fornication."" http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/37160?redirectedFrom=commit#eid

I realise there are various other things that people can commit, but in the case of ""commit suicide"" I think linguistically it's not far removed from ""commit homicide"", ""commit fratricide"" and so on. The negative association with a past criminal act seems fairly clear.

I'm fortunate not to have suffered from this myself, although I have friends who have. It's rather distressing to see that almost every interaction with medical professionals they have results in preconceived conclusions based upon their mental health issues, rather than an unbiased evaluation of the facts and symptoms (as they would with other patients). 

This discrimination seems to result patients being denied care, or receiving poorer levels of treatment - even for issues entirely unrelated to their mental health; in effect punishing them for taking the recommended course of action. 

I'm sure being regarded as incredible or treated with suspicion is an awful thing, especially from the institutions that are supposed to help them. Hence, I can understand why many don't seek treatment when they perhaps ought to (plus, the possibility of being excluded from certain jobs, being used against a person in court, ...).

That being said, I have a hard time believing that even w/o the 'distraction' of CL Man Utd will finish 4th.

I think another interesting wrinkle is that the Europa League winner will qualify for the Champions League. Obviously it's highly unlikely that we'll win the CL but winning the EL is much more in range.

Crystal Palace were supposed to have a 2/3 chance of being relegated and came 11th. To me, confidence and belief made the difference. Tony Pulis came to CP and got them all working together decently, a good run of games gave them more confidence and belief to take people on and by the end of the season they were one of the top performing teams. On the other hand Moyes was handed the Utd job and never got hold of the dressing room. Doubt that was there from the start only grew as questionable results started to pile up. Confidence nose-dived and Utd went from champions to outside european places. Liverpool had their talisman in Luis Suarez but their 11 game winning streak which took them so close was down to team performances and a growing belief among players and fans that anything was possible.

How well a player or team has been performing in a sport over the immediate short-term (last 5 games) means absolutely nothing compared to the medium short-term (last 20 games). Basically the whole idea of ""form"" or ""confidence"" means nothing for individual results and it's an easy way to lose money if you let it influence your betting patterns because bookmakers know this and will play to it.

The difference between Man Utd 12/13 and 13/14 wasn't confidence. It was having a great manager versus an OK manager.

true,86legacy,null,null,"True, but in this case there really isn't much difference in the 3-5th positions in terms of their statistical chance of being in the top 4 (which is our goal, right?).

For example, they have chance of a top 4 finish at: Arsenal (67.2%), Man U (62.7%), and liverpool (54.5%). The difference between us and Arsenal is 12.7%. Where as between Chelsea and Arsenal it's 23.9%. 

I guess my point is, and I am not an expert with statistical analysis, that Bloomberg has the top two positions as almost guaranteed to be in the top 4 (hard to argue with this) and the likelihood they will challenge for the title is great (again, to be expected). 

However, their confidence outside of these two teams is a lot less. To me, this is where the most change could happen. Look, Tottenham isn't even considered relevant for a top 4 finish. To me, this puts it as they are confident that Arsenal, Man U, and Liverpool will be the three teams challenging for the last 3 spots. Pretty straight forward. 

Outliers do happen, think us and Man U, but they can't be predicated. 

TL;DR: The specific numbers mean very little, they are predicting what we already know. Liverpool, Arsenal, and Man U are the most likely candidates to be fighting for the last 2 spots in the top 4 this season.

Rooney couple of years ago became expert at free kicks but he also started scoring long distance goals regularly, another example is Bale who didn't have the shooting power he has now his first couple of seasons. If you watch Suarez' free kicks you will see his technique is focuses on placement more than power, which is why we rarely see him shooting powerful shots but curved shots like Coutinho use to (he drives them low and places them at the corner these days).
  
Hendo already has and ok technique, Sturridge just does it like normal shots (places them without taking time or calculating) and Sterling I don't think has ever taken a free kick for us. I really want to see more of our players taking different types of free kicks and hopefully improving our threat from outside of the box. Currently we only have Sturridge who is able to consistently hit the goal from outside of the box. And now that Suarez is gone they will to try them when Gerrard isn't crossing.


Sturridge needs to improve in the air, he will get lot of crosses and he doesn't seem like he has any ability in the air, he also needs to practice his penalty technique which is currently probably the worst in the squad. Sterling obviously the shooting and even when he showed composure against CIty last season and this pre-season he still isn't very consistent (BVB match) he moves with ease at midfield but doesn't use the same technique when a defender is blocking his way in the box, Coutinho and Suso are a great example of players who will always create a space before shooting regardless of their finishing ability.

2) Love the guy, he works his ass of every time out there, is much better technically than most Premier League center backs and he's just a good soccer player. His leadership is outstanding, he's a loyal servant and absolute professional, and he's absolutely deserving of vice-captain status. But as a defender he's also weak, not great in the air and can be caught on the break, and we seem to leak goals when he's out there, and with Brandaõ's high pressing defense he doesn't seem cut out to play a high line due to his lack of speed. When he's healthy he's an excellent individual defender, but he doesn't seem cut out for the system we've been playing. I want to see him partnered with Lovren and see if he fairs any better than next to Skrtel, because if Agger can be accommodated into the team I think it could be better of with his leadership and ball-playing ability, but the problem is Sakho had been very effective last year and was our best center back, his ball-playing ability, tackling and pace paid off and are tailor made for Brandaõ, and by trying to shoe-horn Agger into the defense Sakho would likely be the first one to be benched. I don't think we should sell him just yet, but keep him around for at least this season considering the depth we'll need for cups and the league, but if isn't going to fit in with the new team he should be given the ability to leave.

true,Melberger,1972crest,,"Armani, the guy who founded it, is a top man.

I remember a series CityTV did about 4 years ago, where they told his story. 

He was trying to make a living selling watches on a beach in Sierra Leone about ten years ago, and he met a blue from Reddish, and they got taking about football.

IIRC Armani was a City fan and had never met one from the UK before, he struck up a friendship with this blue and he soon provided him with old kits etc for a local football team.

Eventually the club got on board and made a series about the football team Armani had started up with the help of the Reddish supporters club and City. Together they donated loads of kit, football boots and even a coach for the players of this local club to travel to play other teams in the country.

It made for a fascinating story, and was really interesting to see how the club and this unlikely friendship had such a positive impact on Armani and the kids in his local area.

It was brilliant to see their passion for football in Sierra Leone. A country with serious poverty, and still recovering from a recent war.

It was humbling.

I'd really recommend watching it if you can find it online. Armani's a really cool personality and it's hard not to like him.

Given the nature of Sierra Leone however, a few years later, and not so long ago, he was targeted with false imprisonment by the owner of another rival club. Due to the corrupt nature of the country he spent months in jail trying to clear his name. Apparently the dispute was over the football boots and kit City and the supporter's clubs had donated to Armani and his team, this owner of the rival club was a powerful businesswoman and had made a complaint against Armani that the equipment was stolen from her club and had him put in jail.

It was an absolute disgrace, thankfully he was eventually released without charge.

On a more positive note, the connection really is a great one, you really couldn't have written one like it. He's even flown over for a few games over here.

I actually saw him at Goodison towards the end of last season, that crucial game where we battled to a vital 2-3 win. I recognised him and saw him running down the steps like a big kid on a sugar rush not far from my seat after we'd scored!

The whole away end was in raptures.

We were complete strangers, but I called out his name on his way back up and shook his hand and we hugged like long lost brothers.

Smiles all around.

It was priceless. Brilliant.

Also you need to chase regularly - call them every couple of days.

Enrique has lots of experience, knows how to use his body, and is generally very solid in one on ones. but Moreno's differing attributes gives him more use to our team and are more relevant to the modern game.

I'm a Brit but I lived in Chile for 2 years, and while I was there I was absolutely stunned by the healthcare. Forget waiting lists: if you want to see a doctor, you can see one straight away, even for non-emergencies. And the doctors are ultra-cautious: they'll order up a full battery of tests to rule out serious problems as a matter of routine. They'll even invite you once a year to have a full health screening. 

And that's just the GPs. The hospitals are like 5 star hotels and the dentists... my god. 

One time I walked into a dentist and asked for an appointment, expecting to be told to come back in a few weeks. Instead they invited me to sit down. I waited 20 minutes then had my check-up. They saw a problem, so ordered an X-Ray. Another 10 minute wait for that. 20 mins after the X-Ray they invited me back into the room for a filling. 

I walked into a dentist with no appointment and no pain, had a check-up, x-ray, and treatment, all in an hour or so. And the cost? 40 pounds - about the same as it would cost at an NHS dentist, only with far better service. And the filling they used was a resin that matches the tooth colour, not the grey amalgam they use in the UK.

I remember clearly when Skrtel was out of favor and basically was benched for a season only to come back like a man on fire. He left Brendan no choice but to put him back in the first team after everyone was doubting his future and resigned to unloading him to Napoli or wherever. Let the man work and do what he needs to do to get back to the level most were accustom to with Daniel. I love his attitude and character to death.

 [**Astroturfing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Astroturfing__ is the practice of masking the [sponsors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponsor_(commercial\)) of a message or organization (e.g. political, advertising, religious or [public relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relation)) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by [grassroots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots) participant(s). It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations more credibility by withholding information about the source's financial connection. The term *astroturfing* is a derivation of [AstroTurf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstroTurf), a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to look like natural grass, a play on the word ""grassroots."" The implication behind the use of the term is that there are no ""true"" or ""natural"" grassroots, but rather ""fake"" or ""artificial"" support, though some astroturfing operatives defend the practice (see Justification below).

true,GhoostP,null,null,"As an American who finally got pushed over the edge this year at the World Cup to start getting into club football; I wanted to address each of these issues and how I feel they apply to me and other Americans picking up a new interest in the EPL.

Tim Howard - One of the #1 reasons for deciding to follow Everton; after the World Cup, what better way to have a connection with a team than to have a National team player as a starter?  I admit though, GK is not a very glorious position on most days, and I wish I had an American field player to root for.  I think Tottenham is making a good move for Yedlin, and will pick up a good deal of US fans for it if it goes through.

Everton's History With Americans - Okay, cool.  It's nice to know they have a history with Americans and therefore may not be so opposed to trying them out again in the future.  A nice to know- but didn't really sway my decision too much.

If You Can't Beat 'Em… - This is going against Everton's favor here.  I'm excited to root for Lukaku, but some other Americans aren't as forgiving about that goal in the WC.

America Loves Roberto Martinez - Probably second big reason I decided to start following Everton.  He was featured on ESPN's broadcast of the WC and did an absolutely great job.  I'm happy to be following him into the EPL season.

America Loves an Underdog - The reason I felt compelled to stray away from Arsenal, Chelsea, and Liverpool was that being a frontrunner from the beginning just doesn't feel American.  (Nothing was going to get me to wear that Chevy jersey, so they were out from the get-go)

Everton Can Actually Win - While I wanted to root for the underdog... that can be tiresome if you never win and end up in relegation.  I believe in Everton; and I hope Everton's growth in America and potential earnings from a new fanbase can boost their wallet to bring in more big name players.

You Can Watch Every Match - This is a centerpiece.  Without being able to watch the matches, my fandom would surely die out sooner than later.


Just thought I'd share my thoughts.  I feel there is a great oppurtunity for big commercial gain by adding a larger US fanbase for any EPL team and I really hope Everton tries to capitalize on it.

Technically (and only technically because MLS bends their own rules) a transfer with a loan back to Seattle should have been completed a week ago (MLS Deadline).  Therefore, they may be holding off on the deal as long as possible because once it's signed, he's gone if the loan wasn't finalized.

Though I think it benefits all parties to let him stay in Seattle.  They're playing well and obviously utilize him.  Whereas we have a questionable Walker with a decent backup in Naughton.  I don't think we need Naughton and Yedlin, but I certainly don't want there to be any chance that Yedlin is playing for us against Liverpool (first game after Transfer Window Deadline).

2) I love him, not only for his abilities, but his presence, leadership, determination, and dedication to the club. I think if Skrtle can bounce back like he did last season, there's no reason Agger can't do the same this season. A lot of people were calling for Skrtle to be transferred last year at this time, but he stepped up and provided an anchor in an otherwise shaky defense, even if he did make a few big mistakes. I think, if he stays healthy, Agger and Lovren in our back 4 could be the pairing of the year. However, with the talent we now have, including a commanding presence in Lovren, Agger seems obsolete. I would love to see him stay and return to the top of his game, but I would also understand him leaving. That money could be allocated to a better cause. 

3) Nobody watches football really. If they do, they support Chelsea, Man U, or Arsenal (again, not really football).

If you'll recall, our defensive record early in the season last year was incredible, but we were relying on late penalties to win.

Once the narrative started building that Spurs couldn't score, AVB tried to create more goals by committing more people into the attack. At that point, we lost the focus in our press and our midfield organization. That's when the pressing from the front fell off and the high line was eviscerated.

true,ManateeSheriff,null,null,"There's lots of good information here already, but I'll add a few things:

1) Pochettino has consistently put his most creative guy on the right side of the attacking midfield. At Southampton that was Lallana, and at Spurs that has been Eriksen. Traditionally, you'd expect that guy to be your number 10, but Poche has opted for a more industrious presser in the middle. When on the ball, the creative guy drifts inside and pulls the defense apart from there.

2) On the opposite side, then, Pochettino plays a speedster whose main job is to run behind the defense over and over again. At Southampton, this was Jay Rodriguez, who had by far the best season of his career because he was constantly finding himself one-on-one with the keeper. In preseason, Poche has been putting Townsend and Lennon out there, and I think that's a major reason you keep hearing that Chadli's on the chopping block -- he's not fast enough to be the threat Poche wants on the left. Lennon has traditionally been terrible on the left, but perhaps in this new role his speed will make him more dangerous. He's looked rejuvenated in the preseason.

3) Despite their initial positions, the attacking four will play very fluid, interchanging football. Lamela, in particular, seems to have license to run all over the field to find space, but you'll also see the creative guy popping up on the left and the speedster running behind the defense from all different angles (as Lennon did when he scored against the Fire).

4) The two pivot men are more defensive than you'd traditionally expect. At Southampton, Pochettino played Wanyama and Schneiderlin together, both of whom could be considered traditional defensive midfielders. Neither of them really approached the box the way, for example, Paulinho does. The front four are tasked with a lot of pressing, but not a lot of tracking back, and the fullbacks are bombing forward a lot, so the system requires a solid pair of defenders in the center of midfield.

5) The system involves a lot of pressing and also quick transitions into offense. At Barcelona, they used to say, ""We rest when we have the ball."" Not Pochettino's teams; they just don't rest at all. His hard training sessions are famous, and Southampton were a very fit side, but you sometimes saw them wearing down at the end of games. Against big sides, they often controlled the early going but had to fall off the press after halftime. It will be interesting to see whether Spurs, with a more talented group of players, can keep it up for the entire game.",0,1407955729,null,0,false,0,cjpaejc,t3_2dfay1,t1_cjpaejc,t3_2dfay1,null,1435219694,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,RupertSacamano,lfc68,,"&gt;Can I just say that I didn't make the A-B-C comparison you're stating and I've prefaced the post by saying that! I even said so that there are several other factors in play here..

You did preface it, but with the thoughts you made it was, at least by my perception, in the end an A-B-C - comparison. The questions you asked where in fact interesting (how we do in europe or ""speculate/talk psuedo-intellectual shit"" like you beautifully phrased :)), but it was the most unfavorable introduction --  but it could be that I'm little to oversensitive regarding the topic, because I'm reading that faaar too often.

&gt;Looking at the Bayern squad again, there are several notable players out so fair point. But Dante got 60 minutes, Lahm got 45 and Goetze got 30 and they were all on by the time Dortmund scored again. That would put 9 potential first team players on the pitch for a good spell of the game (Neuer, Boateng, Alaba, Dante, Lahm, Lewandowski, Shaqiri, Mueller and you could even put Martinez in there).

Except there's a great difference between starting and getting some minutes in a game which is just a bit more competive than a friendly. Bayern was quite solid defensively until the Martinez injury, which rattled the defense. What they lacked was threat over the wings, which is very much needed in a 3-at-the-back system. A threat which was well served last season through Ribery and Robben (in a 4-at-the-back system), today there were Hojberg and Bernat, the former unexperienced, the latter new with the team. A second great Bayern-advantage last season was the security in the middle, to let the ball flow and have experienced players (Lahm, Schweinsteiger, Kroos) which play quite a long time together, today there was Gaudino, who's a Academy-Player who just should help out on the USA tour but played well so Guardiola wanted to see more of him and Shaqiri which wasn't a starter for Bayern last season and didn't take the role in the middle tooo good, there were just too much errors. Which, in my opinion, describes the Bayern performance in general very well today, insufficient flow, slow linkage play and too much faults. And this is something I see to be mainly caused by sending a B-Team (or let's say a B-Plus-Team) out, Pep is known for his system football, which just doesn't works as well when the core of it isn't on the pitch.",0,1407955765,null,0,false,0,cjpafaf,t3_2dgho4,t1_cjpafaf,t1_cjp9rm4,null,1435219699,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I'll tell you why I find it odd, I've earned my frequent flyer pass sadly, and having found myself at UCLH a fortnight ago, which I always consider to be one of the best hospitals in London (I'm biased, a close friend works there!), anyway, I was triaged by a very professional nurse, a credit to everyone who works there, but it had taken 30+ min.  Sure I'd arrived by ambulance, so they knew I wasn't going to die, but still.  She confers quickly with a Dr (in my absence, which is fair) I'm now waiting for imaging, and more vitals.  1 hour passes, I'm x-rayed, I comment at this point the gasair is wearing off.  I'm not new to pain sadly, I'm the kind of person who only realised I must have a fracture when I couldn't use chopsticks, I haven given my self stitches after a nasty animal bite (this tiny, pathetic looking spider) but it was stressing me, and not good to be left so.

Anyway, my point is this experiance was one of the best NHS experiences I've had, yet I was left for over an hour just waiting, no explanation, no pain relief.  Just trying to meditate myself to a light trance.

Before I've had to force ably drag a nurse over to a child who'd vomited what looked like half his body weight, only when I proclaimed my girl friend was a Dr did they realise this poor child was in danger.  The child was being ignored as the parents were too polite, the child quiet as they come, and the A+E dealing with a road crash.  I waited over 6 hours to be seen, I was not vital I knew.

A bad A+E doctor messed up my mothers medication, he was over worked, under rested and gave too much of a medicine, my mother now has diabities, this is a certain direct result, her consultant was amazed and pleased that she didn't sue.

Mistakes happen.  Demand on A+E is hard, it's probably poisson distributed after all, but this whole NHS is perfect circle jerk is pissing me off.  It isn't, it isn't nearly good enough, we should be spending a lot more, we should be demanding a lot more.  No one in my situation (higher rate tax payer) should be thinking of private health, do you know what my tax bill was, I've paid enough for amazing health already thanks, and I'd rather have the triage team decide who gets it.

Let's not pretend that it's amazing or prefect, if you have to be reminding people why it's great, it probably isn't great.  I know I've been far more impressed by Changi Hospital in Singapore than any I've visited in the UK.

The best plan of action is to treat this like any other night. You might have a few reserve universities outside of your first and second choice. Great, google their number if you need it, have it on hand.

**Whatever you do, make sure you can wake up early. Get yourself a twitter account and a StudentRoom forum, they will post the ucas hidden links between the Ucas system crashes** 7:30 ONWARDS FOR UCAS TRACK 

If you've made it into your second choice, decide tonight on the best accomodation by checking with people who have already gone to uni there (If you're going to Nottingham Uni, jubilee's a safe bet and at Trent, Maltings)

If you're going through clearing, don't panic, people go through clearing up until January, it doesn't mean you've failed either. Get your smartphone out to check the phone numbers and call, stating your results. If your school loves their league table place, one of the teachers as you're collecting your result may help

Can I just say, be proud of your results, whatever you choose to do.

Heritability is about population, much like BMI, where as you seem to think it's individualistic.

Furthermore, what's related to the context of this post:
 
&gt;Turkheimer (2003) found that for children of low socioeconomic status heritability of IQ falls almost to zero.

You are, however, implying a (false) dichotomy between *the current way* and *Gove's way*. Most experts seem to be very annoyed both with what Gove is doing **and** with the current system.

Ultimately, it seems like politicians want to avoid tackling the big issue, which is *teaching*. Improving teaching is expensive and difficult, but it's the only thing that will really solve the major problem. That problem is kids - particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds - completely losing interest in academic achievement. Those with pushy parents to chivvy them along (despite mediocre teaching) are lucky.

As education minister, there is an easy way to look like you're doing something useful, which is to fiddle incessantly with the examination system. This doesn't really achieve anything. People love to quip about whether 'measuring a boy repeatedly makes him taller'. Well - does measuring a boy with various different kinds of ruler make him taller either?

It is not just the lack of staff, but also the physical space for extra staff to work.

I think also the demographic might not be quite what they expected all those years ago, I suspect the population is older than expected (life expectancy has increased, plus young people can't afford to live here).

In addition there is a bit of a shortage of GPs round here, 3 week waits aren't uncommon. This results in people pitching up at A&amp;E, sometimes calling a bloody ambulance, for things that they really should be taking to the GP.

Once we agree on a fee, it gives us a ballpark of the market we can shop in.  We identify a target and make contact with their club.  Discuss a fee and if it is aggreeable, we enter talks with the player. FSG fronts Brendan the cash for our new signing, to get him in and then we let Borini go and FSG gets paid back (give or take a few £).  This prevents us from being too vulnerable in the market when teams know we are short in a position and try to get us to pay above market value.

We are holding him back, if his desire is to get matches, because he won't be getting matches here.

Q) Do u think you can captain France to winning the euros in 2016?

A)   Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: It's our target but we know there will be a lot of big football nations there. When you play at home you need the ambition.
.

Q) What thoughts go through your head before a big game?

 A)   Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: You are just thinking about the game. I always feel better once I get out on the pitch and do a warm-up. Otherwise you just get yourself into your own zone.
  

Q) Elliot Harwood What do you like to do outside of training?

A)    Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: I enjoy spending time with my children. That's the main thing for me outside of football.


Q) You have well sculpted stubble. Do you do your own facial hair, or do you use a barber?!


 A)   Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: Thank you Jim! I do it myself!


Q) Who was your idol as a kid?


A)    Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: Pete Sampras. I loved watching him play tennis. His attacking style was great.
.

Q) When someone is taking a penalty, what goes through your mind and makes the decision of what way to go?


 A)   Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: There is no secret to saving a penalty. It's very tough but you have to give yourself a chance to stop it. To do that you have to concentrate. You have to look at his face, his position but after that it's only your feeling. Video can help too but it's mainly feeling on the pitch. It's very different in training and a real match.

Q) Are you thinking of climbing Mt. Everest in your lifetime? if yes, i will be at airport to recieve you

 A)   Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: Before I do Mt. Everest I need to start with Mont Blanc.


Q) Who is the funniest player at Tottenham? Could you tell us about his worst joke that you ever heard?


A) Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: Adebayor and Sandro. If you spend time with them you are bound to laugh!
  

Q) Hugo, what part of your game has improved the most since joining Tottenham?

A)   Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: I feel I have improved the most off the pitch. There are challenges that you have to overcome. I think I've improved all round.


Q) What made you become a goalkeeper?


A)    Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: I started with tennis but I started to play football and just said I want to be a goalkeeper. Don't ask me why! It was just my feeling. I wanted to be decisive for the team.
 

Q) Would you say there's a difference in goalkeeping style between the Premier League and Ligue 1? How have you had to adapt?

A)    Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: Goalkeeping is universal but you have to adapt your game in the Premier League because there is more contact with the goalkeeper. The referees let the game flow much better. This is the charm of the Premier League. Decision making is important for a goalkeeper.


Q) What's it like to know that millions of people see you as an idol?

A)    Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: I don't think about that I just try to do my job. You have to stay focused.
 

Q) Who is the best player you have ever played against?

A)    Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: Suarez, Messi, Raul, Ronaldo. It's difficult to choose just one player!
 

Q) Who is the most playful person in training?

A)    Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: Adebayor. He always plays with a smile on his face. He is always laughing!
 

Q) Who's got the most difficult shot to deal with out of the 

A) Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: Eriksen. You cannot read his shot.

Q) Dorrell Who is your favourite goalkeeper of all time?

A) Tottenham Hotspur Hugo: Casillas, Buffon, Barthez. It's difficult to choose one.

&gt;The problem your son had was something that can be directly observed (not something a drug seeker or malingerer would choose to fake)

That's right - the fatal flaw of the NHS is all the drug addicts coming in for free drugs while the doctors stand by helpless ""I can do nothing! The drugs are free for her! Curses!""

&gt;there’s no question of what to do about it when the problem is identified, what to do about it is very simple and will cost them very little to provide. Thus you got good service.

That's right. We can't afford American-level expertise or equipment. All we have is a couple of guys who dropped out of vet training and some old spatulas, so if you go in with anything more dangerous that something stuck in your eye, you're literally going to die.

&gt;Now, if the issue was expensive, not so clear cut and something elective things tend to go differently.

That's right. Just as your politicians told you, if  Stephen Hawking were british, we'd have said ""sorry mate, too expensive. fuck off and die.""

&gt;The basic problem with NHS-style systems is that you have the same people paying the bills and defining what constitutes good care. That’s a big conflict of interest and the patients in the grey areas tend to get bit by it.

I'm pretty sure that's not the case at all. I'm pretty confident that the last doctor I saw wasn't in charge of either local or national health funding. Unlike the American system, where the people who pay the bills (insurance companies) have absolutely no say in the matter of what they will pay for, depending on if they feel it is good or necessary care, or even covered by your plan.

&gt;There’s also the fact that they basically rely on the regulators rather than lawsuits

1) How do you think this season will go?

I think we'll be in the chase for the title.  Without too many changes we have a stronger team than last year, but my chief concern since last summer has been over Pellegrini's ability to motivate the team.  Last season his master stroke is that he didn't motivate the team as much as he calmed them down and kept them from doing a ""Typical City"", but I still can't shake my doubts.

2) Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why? It would help if you can put the 3 names in bold.

**Joe Hart** has had a topsy turvey couple of seasons but looked back to his best in the second half of last season.  Willy Caballero will provide stiffer competition for the starting spot so Hart will have to push himself.

The big money addition to the squad this summer is **Eliaquim Mangala**.  A big French centre half who will be hoping to tighten up a defence that dropped a lot of points in the early stages of last season.

After an injury plagued debut season **Stevan Jovetic** has stayed fit throughout the full preseason and will be hoping to show the Premier League exactly what he is capable of.

3) If anyone wants to offer a lineup

When everyone's fit, this is a fairly typical lineup,

but all positions have a good rotation option

true,acarmine,newcr-1,,"As a newly minted american everton fan, here are my reasons for choosing the club.  

1.  I hate perennial top teams.  fuck the patriots, fuck the heat/lakers.  This nixxed Chelsea, Man. U, Man. City.  

2.  I tend to root for a good underdog &amp; likeable teams.  I'm not a true fan of any professional american sports teams because I don't have a local sports team, so I root for whichever team I like better that particular game or if a certain result will be beneficial to another team I like at the time.  Everton fits that mold as a solid contender and nobody particularly hates them (except on derby days). 

3.  As a Nebraskan I can only call myself a true supporter of our college Football team.  We have a reputation of being the nicest fans in all of collegiate football.  I get the sense that Everton extends that reputation as well.  

4.  My co-worker is a Liverpool fan.  The rivalry was unbeknownst to me before I decided to throw my hat in with Everton (still learning the geography of the PL).  This will make for some great trash talk to pass the long hours.  

5.  The new kit is awesome.  I'm a sucker for a dark blue.  I wasn't too keen on the previous royal blue and yellow theme, but this year....fuck ya!  Got a gift card from soccer.com last month from a survey, and I've been carefully weighing my options on where to spend it.  My Everton home kit should hopefully arrive this Friday.

I will never consider myself a true supporter of Everton, just a fan.  I know what it's like to grow up with your team and ""bleed insert-color-here"". ",0,1407962603,null,0,false,0,cjpe8wv,t3_2dgd14,t1_cjpe8wv,t3_2dgd14,null,1435221589,6,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,6

true,kochcurve,null,null,"There is some good information presented there and I'll add to what you have to say in this reply. All schools have a program to help oxbridge hopefuls get a place, and these programs are where public education and private education really start to differ. At my school students were given an hour a week with a teacher who hadn't been through the application process and was a full time teacher, really someone who was trying to gain a favorable situation with the senior management. The advice was pretty thin, occasionally dubious and otherwise freely available. Certain teachers, if they were so inclined, would take time with hopefuls, give them interview style 1-1 time and such, I got lucky since for me this guy was an Oxford chem graduate with a PhD. This is the extent of it though, this is all one had in the way of support from a '2nd from best' ofsted rank, biggest in the county grammar school.

Private schools have the resources to hire professionals, genuine Cambridge / Oxford faculty (or ex-faculty perhaps, credit to the aforementioned institutions rules) to come to their schools, give interviews and advice to the students for truly exorbitant fees (£200 for a non student to go for 1 day by the grace of the school in question). There are events such as the 'Cambridge Scholarship Program', whereby an applicant can pay £6000 + £200 application fee to get lectured for 2 weeks at Cambridge and various other paid summer schools etc. that look very good on a personal statement and will work in ones favor during an interview. I could talk at great length still about advantages given to private school students during the application process. You've mentioned some more benefits afforded to more affluent students in other aspects as well, the standard of teaching, the student : staff ratio in private schools is far superior to those in state schools.

There are more subtle differences between the classes still, affluent families can afford a parent or carer to cook for their kids in the evenings. Half of weekdays throughout my time in school I either didn't eat or ate ready meals sold at reduced price, all tasks are harder when one is hungry.

Well, I'll say nothing more of the advantage of the affluent, I've thought about this a lot and I have more to say, though I fear I'll get my arguments in the wrong order and weaken myself in this thing since I want to end quickly. I'll close with this though; the most outrageous aspect of this situation is the conviction of the institutions and the government that all is fair and equal, that just because the institutions no longer discriminate between public school students and private school students on that criteria alone there exists no advantage for the affluent.

However - I don't know why - but Williams' death has felt different to me. In fact when I heard yesterday morning I had the usual 'oh, that's a shame' reaction you did, but then I thought about it and watched Dead Poets Society and I am genuinely sad about it. Of course, not in the same way I would be if a family or friend died, and it won't impact my day-to-day life, but I just feel sad.

I think it might have been because of how he died. I think there is something heartbreaking in a person who is so revered for their comedy and ability to entertain the world but who is suffering inside. He obviously struggled with depression for years and was very frank about it, and I think I'm just sad to see that there are cases in which the illness does beat a person and they take their own life. I've struggled in the past with feeling very low and having suicidal thoughts and although I would say I'm absolutely fine now and happy in my life, it's just a reminder that for some people that illness never goes away.

For me, Williams' death just highlights the thousands (or even millions) of people in the world that struggle with the illness - many of whom never get help. It just saddens me to think about. Perhaps that's what I'm more upset about personally rather than his death directly, although of course it is a tragedy.

Whilst in discussion on a web forum I got speaking to some young Muslims and I was struck as to just how similar in terms of absolutism and hard line views they held and how similar they were to the Far Right groups.

At first I tried really hard to put it down to the reactionary views of  the young etc.

But then I found  organisations like [5pillarz](http://www.5pillarz.com/) 
who claim to be a un-biased source of Islamic views and news

When I went to their Facebook page (90,000 Likes) my jaw dropped as to just how far disconnected so may of them are/were from 'mainstream' thought.


So many Muslims from all different sects and from all over the UK with ISIS flags as their profile pics, praising the establishment of the Kaliphate, genuinely believing ISIS are CIA and Mossad funded. Shocking anti-Semitism, glorification of appalling violence the list goes on and on. 

Please don't take my word for it go and see it for yourself. 

I'm a die-hard Leftie, born and bred to immigrant parents on a rough council estate in Central London and even growing up in the mid-70's and 80's with BM, NF, IRA, Footie Firms etc I have never experienced such genuine nihilistic and profound seething hatred for the 'kafir'   

And before you pile in with the inevitable 'just a minority, ""not representative of moderate Muslims"" I urge you to check out some of the profile and professions. I've counted teachers, council workers, office workers, restaurant owners, mechanics, civil servants, housewives, school kids and University students.

This isn't just Choudry and a bunch of bleating blinkered followers, this appears to be something much deeper and more significant than I think many Muslims and non-Muslims are prepared to admit.

He was pretty quiet by his standards in the title run in, where Sterling and Gerrard came to the fore.

We have a settled playing style and philosophy that means we will not do a Spurs. AVB rode off of Bale's winners, Spurs were never as complete and competitive a team as us. So when Bale left, he actually had to build a team and couldn't.

Also, Spurs did not actually do that badly in the end. They were only a few points worse off, despite Lamela being injured all year and Soldado flopping. Add to that the fact that they signed players with very little PL experience, and added 4/5 new starters to the team.

We will inevitably face some issues throughout the early parts of the season where we may have looked to Suarez to create or lead, but eventually we'll grow past that.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"The difference with Spurs is that Rodgers played a massive part in picking the players we've picked up this year. AVB had little, if any, say in the matter. Baldini picked many of them, especially their 'marquee' signing Lamela, who was at Roma with Baldini just a short while before. I've heard that AVB had no idea that some of the players were signing until right before they did.

Add to that the fact that they had no set system of play in place. Bale covered up gaping holes in their squad. They relied on him in 2012/13 more than we ever relied on Suarez. Just calculating points he won alone will lead to that conclusion. I was talking to my best mate (a Spurs fan) about it this time last year and we worked out that Bale's winning goals accounted for 23 points Spurs got that previous season. Of course, that argument ignores the fact that some of those points had Bale not played would've been at least partially replaced by whoever stepped in for Bale anyway. But he was still the biggest asset in that squad by a considerable margin, in terms of points won.

Of course, Suarez scored a bucketload of goals for us, but in terms of points won, each of those goals had a smaller effect than Bale's goals the previous season. Suarez scored 4 vs Norwich in one match, 3 vs WBA, etc etc, when only one in each was needed, for example. Bale scored 20-odd goals that previous season and almost all of them were vital in terms of earning a draw instead of a loss, or earning 3 points instead of just 1. You know what I mean?

He was born on the 10th of April 1996. He signed from us from Danish club Brøndby IF (One of the bigger teams in the Danish league). He chose us ahead of teams like Arsenal and City. 

**Paying Style:**
He relies mainly on his intelligence, more so than physicality. He has been compared to Ricardo Carvalho by the youth coaches due to his technique and ability to read the game. He is a fairly good tackler and will only get better as his body matures (He is only 18 years old). He is very composed on the ball and isn't phased by pressure. His positioning is good and will only get better. He played big roles last year in both the FA youth cup and the U21 Premier League wins. 

**My opinion:**
IMO he could be a great player for us in the future. As stated earlier he is already, at 18 years of age, a brilliant reader of the game. You'll regularly see him intercept passes and distribute the ball really well. Him and Zouma could make a brilliant partnership in the future. With Zouma being the complete tank that he is and Christensen being the more technical centre back we could have an amazing pairing on our hands.

The other thing to take note of is that many of the players Spurs bought were from outside the PL, and it takes time to adjust to a new league. Of the seven players we've brought in so far, 3 have previous Premier League experience and Can has enough physicality that he should be able to adapt quickly.

If you did the same with god knows how many categories which make up ""other"", you would end up with a pie chart with hundreds of tiny slices, none of them identifiable as particularly significant.

So what do you do, give up altogether? No, you have to put effort into all of them.

You do have a point that benefit fraud seems to get more flack than it truly deserves. Maybe if people see someone sitting on their arse taking money they aren't entitled to, it is more infuriating than someone who works hard but is a bit cheeky when it comes to paying tax (it isn't actually any different of course). Maybe people understand benefit fraud, whereas they can't get their heads around some complex VAT fraud, so they can't get quite as worked up about it.

The whole ""do a Spurs"" thing is a load of rubbish. If Suarez would have stayed we'd have probably still brought in all the players that we have done.

Another big difference is Bale was Spurs main goal threat, last season we had Suarez &amp; Sturridge, plus Raheem upped his game towards the end of the season. We still have a lot of players who can score goals and have proved they can score goals. Spurs got Soldado who was not a threat at all.

The whole do a Spurs argument is really fucking annoying because it isn't going to happen, we've added a lot of depth to our squad, not all of these new additions are going to be starters.

AVB was given 4-5 new unproven players who were all going to be starters, Bale left and instead of trying to replace him they tried to rebuild their whole squad, it was never going to work out.

Anyway, going back to the points I was making, many of the players Spurs bought to replace Bale were just aimlessly bought, it seemed. Spurs with Bale had no identity. No plan B. It seemed that when things got tough for them in 2012/13, their only plan was 'give it to Gareth and hope he scores another worldy'.

Therefore, when it came to recruiting players to replace him, it seemed Spurs just bought whoever was the popular target that week. Eriksen has been very good for them, but the rest have all disappointed greatly.

We on the other hand know exactly how we played with and without Suarez last season. That carries over to this season. Our players know their collective strengths and weaknesses and they play to maximise those strengths. They're much more versatile than **any** player Spurs have had in the last 2-3 seasons. We buy attackers who are fluid, who can play across the line. Our midfielders are hasslers. They're strong and don't give up. When we lose the ball, the entire team aims to win it back within a matter of seconds. If we don't, we drop back into a more structured formation and wait for a chance to win the ball back. We're much more disciplined than Spurs have ever been. Granted, our defence last year was shockingly poor, especially for our standards. I was a massive critic of our defenders last year and I'm glad we've finally addressed that. So we can only assume we'll be better off in that regard this upcoming season as well.

Then there's the management/coaching. Like I alluded to earlier, Spurs have no plan B. They never have. They played with a high line every week, despite everyone and their dog being able to tell it would backfire horribly against quick teams like us and City. They had no creativity up front either, apart from Eriksen. Both of their managers did exactly the same thing. Neither could figure out the players strengths and weaknesses.

That all being said, doing a Spurs wouldn't be a disaster. They finished 6th, one place back from the year before. In the grand scheme of things, that's probably exactly where they deserved. They have probably the 6th or 7th best squad in the league. Ours is considerably better from back to front. If we finish one place back from last year, we'll still have guaranteed CL football next year.",0,1407965104,null,0,false,0,cjpfm21,t3_2dh2k2,t1_cjpfm21,t1_cjpf6nl,null,1435455513,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;__Ermine Street__ is the name of a major [Roman road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_road) in England that ran from [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) (*[Londinium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Londinium)*) to [Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Lincolnshire) (*[Lindum Colonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindum_Colonia)*) and [York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York) (*[Eboracum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eboracum)*). The [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language) name was 'Earninga Straete' (1012), named after a tribe called the *Earningas*, who inhabited a district later known as *Armingford Hundred*, around [Arrington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrington), [Cambridgeshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire) and [Royston, Hertfordshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royston,_Hertfordshire). 'Armingford', and 'Arrington' share the same Old English origin. The original Roman name for the route is unknown. It is also known as the __Old North Road__ from London to where it joins the [A1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_road_(Great_Britain\)) [Great North Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_North_Road_(United_Kingdom\)) near [Godmanchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godmanchester).

&gt;

&gt;__Frobisher__ is a [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character) who appeared in the *[Doctor Who Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_Magazine)* comic strip based on the long-running British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* in the 1980s. He was a [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)) of the [Sixth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Doctor) and [Seventh Doctors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Doctor).

&gt;Frobisher is a __Whifferdill__, one of a [shape-changing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting) [extraterrestrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life) race. What is assumed to be his natural form, as seen in his first comic strip appearance, is [humanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid), pale yellow in color, three to four feet in height, with a round, featureless head, and wearing spectacles. However, he preferred to spend his free time in the form of a [penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin).

&gt;When he first appeared in *The Shape Shifter* (DWM #88-#89), written by [Steve Parkhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Parkhouse) with art by [John Ridgway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ridgway_(comic_artist\)), Frobisher was a [private investigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator) calling himself ""Avan Tarklu"" (a play on the phrase ""Haven't a clue""). He came across [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) when an enemy of the Time Lord, Josiah Dogbolter, had placed a bounty on the Doctor in an effort to acquire his secrets and his TARDIS. After infiltrating the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS), instead of turning the Doctor in for the money, Tarklu decided that he liked the [Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) and helped him against Dogbolter; both split the advance bounty Tarklu had been given from Dogbolter. He then joined the Doctor on his journeys. He assumed the name of Frobisher because he felt that it sounded British and thought that the Doctor would like that.

So I agree it's always good to test your own biases and follow your beliefs to the logical conclusion... even though sometimes it just comes down to a matter of principle.

In response I hope you don't mind if I break down your arguments into manageable chunks....

&gt; but if we accept freedom is important, then it's vital we protect the freedom of the masses by doing everything we can to stop others impeding on the freedom (e.g. committing crimes).

First we must answer the question - does crime impede upon the freedom of the masses (or individuals). In many cases I do not believe so. If I break into your house and steal your laptop, do I deprive you of your freedom, or rather do I deprive you of your time and money? You still have your freedom to continue with your life, albeit more inconvenienced than usual for a temporary time - I have not taken away your freedom to do what you like. If on the other hand I was to kidnap or murder you - then I do deprive you of your freedom. So not all crime leads to a loss of freedom for others- only crimes that target freedom specifically.

In most cases of crime you may be inconvenienced or troubled, but ultimately you have the opportunity to continue with your life and move beyond it. In the case of murder or kidnapping, you are deprived of this opportunity - especially murder because it is final - there is no ability to return to normal life and recover. Which leads us to....

&gt; Sacrificing the freedom of a few innocents for the freedom of others is an inevitability because the practical aspects of any legal system are subject to human error - the freedom of the majority is more important than the freedom of the inevitable minority of those wrongly convicted"".

So, if we take the kidnapping example - it's a horrible experience in which you as a free person has been deprived of freedom for a period of time. However, if things go well you get your life back. Let's say the police arrest an innocent man but for whatever reason he ends up being convicted of your kidnapping - and now he is deprived of some freedom. But later new evidence turns up, it is found that he was innocent all along, he is now in the same position as you - we have 2 innocent people who have been deprived of freedom for a time but are both alive, but are now able to get on with their lives.

But let's not forget - we're discussing the death penalty, not freedom... so in the case of murder. Let's say the same innocent man gets arrested again, but this time, because it's murder, he's given the death penalty. Later, after his execution he is found to have been innocent - unfortunately he is no longer able to go back to living his normal life - it is over. So rather than having just 1 innocent person dead, we have 2. We're not just depriving the man of freedom, we've taken his whole life away.

We both agree that the system is subject to human error  - which is why we have courts, appeals, procedures and evidence. It seems to me if we are going to execute people we find guilty though we accept some may be innocent, we are really saying that all that stuff doesn't matter. We are also saying that although the real murderer is still out there - we don't consider it important that they are caught.

&gt; you're effectively saying ""because we can't do it right, we shouldn't do it at all"".

I'm not saying that at all. I'm actually saying that if we have a law that red jumpers must not be worn on a Sunday, but then we start prosecuting people who wear pink jumpers because they look close enough to red, or conversely everyone ignored it including the authorities, then really the law about ""red jumpers on a Sunday"" is arbitrary and not enforced - it may as well not exist because it is not being followed.

This is actually how law works in the real world... case in point, recent changes to the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act to allow format shifting and parodies - because people were ignoring the law (actually many UK citizens don't even realise they have been living a criminal lifestyle up to now) and police were not enforcing it. The truth is, if the majority of the UK citizenry decided to become bloodthirsty, murdering maniacs overnight... they would ignore the law, the police would ignore the law and eventually the government would follow the lead of the people and make murder legal.

&gt; So where do you draw the line regarding acceptable consequences of human error/mistake?

At the line where people are killed by other people unnecessarily.

&gt; It's almost comparable to the argument ""we should never have explored electricity when we discovered it, because some people will accidentally kill themselves with it.""

Not really. Someone killing *themselves* through bad practice, suicide or stupidity is the result of someone exercising their freedom to the fullest extent. I am free to stick a fork in a socket if I want and there's not much to stop me... you could make it illegal, set a prison sentence to life imprisonment or death penalty, but I'm free to do it whenever I like.

If I survive, and the government finds out I did do it, then they prosecute me and I *lose* that freedom.",0,1407966154,null,0,false,0,cjpg6bw,t3_2dexm4,t1_cjpg6bw,t1_cjp1nqf,null,1435222417,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Decium,null,null,"Strengths:

* Doesn't have any sort of injury problems.  The few bumps he did suffer he bounced right back from.  He also played the most minutes of anyone on the Sounders last season - his rookie year.

* He's quick, he's fast, and he's got pace.  Watch [this @ 3 minutes in](http://vimeo.com/99741936) to see him in action.

* Defends near post on corners very well and saved probably 5 goals last year.  Nothing to write home about, but it is worth mentioning.

* At the start of last year his crosses were all over the place and rarely threatening.  This season they've been *much* better and are at worst now barely out of reach of the forward.  So he's definitely able to improve his game.

* Looked much better and more confident at the World Cup games than he has all season.  This shows his ability to not only rise to the occasion but also play better when he's surrounded by better players and better coaches.

* His endurance, determination, and motivation will last through the entire game.  One example comes to mind is in the 2nd leg of a playoff match last year against their rivals the Portland Timbers.  The sounders gave up 3 early goals and were down 0-5 on aggregate.  At about 60' into the game the sounders had given up hope, and their play was reflecting that fact.  Yedlin seemed like the only person trying, and was able to score a goal off a set piece.  Then he bombed up the side and put in a cross for an easy header a few minutes later.  The sounders still lost 5-2 on aggregate, but at least for the last 20 minutes of the game he was able to rally the team into actually playing.

* Able to beat defenders dribbling 1v1, and not greedy with the ball.  

* Good for an occasional goal when the opportunity falls to him.  Think he had 3 or 4 last year.  [Here's one example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I5xBQqtjJA), which is about the only time I recall him taking a shot from outside the box.  The other ones were loose balls bouncing around in the box.

Weaknesses:

* His first touch can be really heavy at times and lead to silly turnovers (and has led to goals).  

* Will pick up an occasional yellow card from frustration.  Not a big concern though, only a handful a season.

* Basically every aspect of defending is pretty weak.  His marking is decent and his speed allows for him to recover easily.  His strength has improved since last season too.  His positioning and decision making will range from average to poor with the occasional ""well that was just embarrassing"" moment.  He's only been playing at right back for like 2.5 years though, so this is hardly surprising.  He's never had the benefit of a good defending coach either.

    This quote from Caleb Porter (his college coach who now coaches their rival team Portland) sums it up:

&gt;“Could he be a winger? Yeah, sure,” Porter says. “But when you look at the top wingers, he’s never going to be more technical and more clever off the dribble and in his combination and movement than those guys are. He just doesn't have that. But at right back? With his athleticism, bombing forward, going box to box? Right now, this is just the tip of the iceberg. I mean, he obviously already looks like the right back of the future for our national team. Beyond that, he can be a Champions League right back. He can be that good.” The difference, says Porter: At age 21, it may already be too late to master the finer points of midfield technique. But defending? “Yeah,” Porter says, “that can definitely be taught.”",0,1407966339,null,0,false,0,cjpg9wc,t3_2dgsos,t1_cjpg9wc,t1_cjpct0t,null,1435222463,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

It's always tricky with mental health, as those that need it usually don't want it or have trouble going through with the therapy or taking the pills every day. Especially because neither produces a short term effect- so what's the point? If you can't muster the energy to get up in the morning then how can you bring yourself to go to the therapist's every week? If you're persuaded into doing it by someone else then you're not really at the right stage to open your mind up to help as well, so you're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Personally, I've not had a problem getting a therapist on the NHS, but I was 18 when I started going so perhaps that had something to do with it. Higher risk and all that. Or probably just location lottery.

Floating timeslot syndrome abounded, reruns would be aired in place of scheduled new episodes, and they would frequently be scheduled immediately following sporting events which always ran long.

If, by some miracle, the telemovie had actually gotten ratings which the executives couldn't downplay or ignore, they would have filmed a ten-episode season, aired the first three episodes out of order, scheduled it for a different time and day every third week, broken the remaining episodes up into A/B segments to be aired as individual episodes at half length, and abruptly stopped airing it after broadcasting the first half of what was originally the seventh episode.

No news would have surfaced for months, and not even the cast and crew would be told what, if any future there might be for the show. The pilot and episode 3.5 would be released on home video, but one would have out-of-synch audio, and the other would be missing a scene, and have two other scenes out of sequence. Further videos would be solicited to retailers, but the release date would always be at least 3 months in the future.

Finally, when customer demand mounted up to a point which couldn't be plausibly dismissed, the ""Complete Collection"" would be released on DVD in a four-disc set. The initial pressing would include discs 1 and 2, plus 2 copies of disc 3. The replacement discs initially sent out would have audio problems, with a low buzzing sound in the left channel throughout playback.

After a long letter writing campaign, Fox would finally relent and release the remastered complete collection. Purchasers of the flawed set would be given 20% off the purchase price. Despite selling over 150,000 units of the flawed set, they would only press 10,000 copies of the remastered set, and would only ship about half of them. This remastered set would be of substantially lower quality video, and the sound would be entirely mono, but the episodes would all be present in the intended sequence.

Today, that box set would sell for approximately $200, with only a subtle packaging difference between the tolerable, complete version and the completely ruined original pressing.",0,1407967391,null,0,false,0,cjpgtvl,t3_2ddjf7,t1_cjpgtvl,t1_cjok32u,null,1435222787,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

For me, I don't think it is about getting younger, necessarily, but I have to put faith in BR and the system that he is developing.  If he is seeing Agger being outperformed in practices in the system he is developing, I have to trust that BR will make the decisions that will be best both in the short term and long term success of the team.  I wasn't a fan of Agger riding the bench most of last season, but I also didn't work with the team in any practices, so my opinion is limited.

First, I'm going to ask - like all sensible scientists - what is intelligence?  Surely not something as arbitrary as scores on IQ tests, which we know full well people can easily become better at by training, indeed arbitrarily _are_ better at if they possess certain characteristics or occupy certain occupations?  If you're not measuring something which is valid, something which actually _gets at_ intelligence, it is totally irrelevant if you an measure it reliably, nor what you can manage to correlate with it or how many genes you link it to...

&gt;You're already really grasping at straws with next to no evidence in your favour.

The irony is delicious...

&gt;If you think IQ doesn't mean anything, go try and teach someone with an IQ of 80 how to perform brain surgery, then let them practice on you. 

See, there's _more_ evidence that IQ tests are poorly performed by those with functional brain damage...  Now you might be on to something.

1) obviously we're looking to win the league, but I think it will be even harder this year. We have made some very good signings, but the money spent looks like a modest amount compared to chelsea who already came in second place. Even more worrying is that players like costa and fabregas are looking like great deals (albeit expensive great deals). Other teams like Liverpool and arsenal have made good signings, and man u are looking good, but at the end of the day I think it'll be a hard fought battle with chelsea for 1st. No shame in coming in 2nd, but the league will be a priority so it's still very important we win again.

2) I'll keep this short and sweet: 1-jovetic. Amazing preseason and was injured most of last season so this will be the first time most pl fans can see just how good he is. 2- navas. Again, he's had a great preseason and with city's attacking style there are always lots of players in the box to meet his crosses. He was vital last season and will be again. 3-silva. Every last city fan knows how much better we play with him on the field, nothing too different has changed this year, but he is always a very important player in every game he plays in, if not the most important.

**1- How do you think this season will go?**

Barring injury (obviously), this season should go well. There are a few teams in the Premier League that have a strong squad, but if we're talking about depth strength, that list narrows down to three, maybe four. There is enough quality in the squad for a definite top 3 finish in the league, if not winning it again. It's no secret that teams like Chelsea and Arsenal are well equipped to challenge for the title. The ability to stay focused might be the biggest challenge.

**2- Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why?**

**Stevan Jovetic** has a great opportunity to contribute early. He had a good pre-season and with Negredo injured and Aguero slowly working back to fitness, the time to show what he can do is now.

**Joe Hart** now has legitimate competition for the goalkeeper spot. When he was benched last year, he responded well. If Caballero can provide the competition everyone is expecting, Hart will be forced to perform well to keep his job or risk another (and more telling) benching.

Last season, Aleks Kolarov became the preferred left back as the season progressed, but **Gael Clichy** still has plenty to offer. He has the ability and the mentality to fight for his place in the starting eleven. If he's able to improve his crossing, he could have a pretty high number of assists by season's end.",0,1407971953,null,0,false,0,cjpj2pg,t3_2dgu72,t1_cjpj2pg,t3_2dgu72,null,1435223844,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

true,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"If there was a United Ireland it is highly unlikely that there would be an outbreak of Violence. If we look back at the formation of this state, it was a brutally repressive regime that used state sanctioned violence against its Minority Catholic population.

&gt; Between June 1920 and June 1922 428 people were killed and 1,766 were
&gt; wounded. 8,750 Catholics were driven from their employment and 23,000 were
&gt; driven from their homes (Buckland, P 1981: 46-50)^[1](http://www.communitydialogue.org/PDFs/UnderstandNI-HistJune05.pdf)

The New ""Northern Ireland"" set about creating a one party state with institutions and infrastructure that routinely and systematically discriminated against Catholics. This oppression did not necessarily lead to a mass uprising.The IRA border [campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Campaign_%28Irish_Republican_Army%29) was ineffective and largely ignored by the catholic population and the IRA of their own accord abandoned it.

The Nature of the state remained largely unchanged until the civil rights movements. They where demands that would have led to more participation in the state and equal rights for all citizens. In effect Nationalists wanted to be treated equally within the state of Northern Ireland. 
The brutal repressive onslaught that the state unleashed on peaceful protesters led to a sea change in thought within the catholic community, spontaneous defense committees sprung up. At this time the IRA had dwindled into a tiny organistion. They were mocked by the Nationalist community; slogans were daubed on walls I.R.A: I RAN AWAY. The IRA heavily influenced by Marxism had increasingly turned its sights to community based activism rather than militarism had in fact been involved heavily in the Civil Rights Movement and saw that as a way forward. They simply did not expect a return to violence. The leadership viewed that a return to armed struggle would inevitably lead to an escalation in sectarianism. Faced with an increasingly hostile state, The IRA split over the issue; Giving birth to the PIRA and the Official IRA. The rest is history.

Republican Ideology has been dragged through a murky and twisted past, perversions have been carried out in its name, But lessons have been learned. A united Ireland could only be created if all citizens are treated equally, every aspect of Republican thought revolves around that idea. Anyone who claims to be a Republican and fails to want that; falls at the first Hurdle. 

&gt; The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all of its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.

To summarise; there is no intention to discriminate against Protestants in a potential United Ireland. They would be cherished as equal citizens just like anyone else.",0,1407972785,null,0,false,0,cjpjgs6,t3_2ddh2q,t1_cjpjgs6,t1_cjpg9e7,null,1435224040,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

It's bizarre. What other service can't/won't give you a quote until you have the service. 

So it's all done. Couple months later, $8k bill. We complained. It has been re-coded and now the hospital only charged $2k. However, the insurance adjusts it to $800. But we still have to pay that as a deductible (aka excess).

true,arc4angel100,EN,england,"i've just never seen him as a great player people see him as. I really can't see why there was ever a fight with Man U over him. Of all the players we can afford to lose he seems like the best option for me.

These are all of the listed non homegrown players (from what I can tell)

Petr Čech	

Branislav Ivanović

Filipe Luís	

Kurt Zouma

Ramires	

Fernando Torres	

Eden Hazard

Oscar	

John Obi Mikel

Thibaut Courtois	

André Schürrle

Didier Drogba

Marco van Ginkel	

Mohamed Salah

Diego Costa

Nemanja Matić

Willian

Mark Schwarzer	

César Azpilicueta	

the only viable options we have from my perspective currently are van Ginkel, Mikel, Cech and Torres. 

Cech is still a great keeper and we need to have 3 keepers for insurance purposes, so if we did choose to sell him we would need a replacement who is homegrown

Van Ginkel could possibly be loaned out although judging by his performances in pre-season I have a feeling that Jose will start rotating him into the squad gradually. 

Torres is a difficult situation. His wages seem to be scaring away all possible buyers. Also we would probably need a replacement striker who meets the home grown standards to maintain our depth. 

Mikel seems to be the best option of the 4. We have enough depth in our midfield to cover his position and with what he has to offer I really don't see him staying much longer especially with the prospect of van Ginkel coming into the side.",1,1407973745,null,0,1407974011,0,cjpjwvy,t3_2dhfw2,t1_cjpjwvy,t1_cjpjmcf,null,1435224245,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Higher exam results mean either a) exams are easier or b) students are doing better.

If b), either 1) schools are teaching better (in which case Ofsted does work) or 2) students are doing better all by themselves (in which case it doesn't).

true,winchyy,lfc68,,"So first off Reus is a long shot. A really, really long shot. He's good enough to play for any team in the world, and a player that good will want Champions League football year in year out.

Considering we have only just requalified for the Champions League, on the back of one of the best players in the world, I think it unlikely that big name players will want to come to Anfield until we have consistently secured Champions League football year in year out.

The last thing Marco Reus wants is to be playing for Dortmund in the Champions League every year, only to move to Liverpool and be playing Europa League next season.

Alot of the time in transfers the players agent will be contacted by clubs to ascertain whether or not the player is interested in moving and where he would prefer to go. When a club is told by a player that he does not want to move their, they are not going to put a bid in.

While I don't think that Reus has told Liverpool no, with the stranglehold that Bayern Munich has over German talent, and the reported interest in him by Real Madrid, Barcelona and United, he is clearly waiting to see who has the best offer. He might have already decided to move next season when his release clause comes into effect. With that, he might have already decided where he wants to go.

Therefore I think he'll move next summer to Bayern or Barcelona, but anything is possible with the sort of money we still have.

Remy has an apparent heart condition that they found in his medical. If a club of Liverpool's size with our medical facilities and resources deem him unfit for transfer, then other clubs will acknowledge this and will no longer be interested. Harsh, but fair.

I say Salah goes, my thoughts:

The ideal situation for me would be to loan Salah somewhere he can get a lot of time because his ceiling is so high with all the flashes of speed and technique he's shown so far. He needs to marinate in epl sauce.

Mikel should stay because he offers physical presence that is such an integral part of mourinho's game, no other midfielder but matic provides us with that. He's got the champions league experience, and he has been of pretty good service to us over the years. A player like him can really give us the defensive edge, which is so vital for the club.

I think Moses deserves a season with us to come off the bench. He has a lot more premier league experience than Salah and with newer squads it's always most likely that the more experienced players play better. Hopefully he has trained well and is ready to prove worthy of a selection. Who knows, all it could take is a couple appearances and a goal or two to really start finding his form. He's had some poor displays, but he definitely has the experience and talent to become a solid player for the club. 

Then sell Torres, dirt cheap if we have to, so we don't have to pay him to do nothing here another year. I like the guy and I feel for him but clearly blue isn't his color.

true,brianlaukh,logo,,"1.) In all honestly, most of us here would love to have us retain the title, but I feel that this year is going to be much more tight and tenser than last year. The potential of having six teams fight for a trophy is insane, we would have to work hard and perform well to take it. I personally feel that City will do better than Chelsea and take maybe first or second place, however if Arsenal stay fit, we will have a hard time dealing with them. I believe we'll have wonderful cup runs even though Pellegrini may not focus the team on them as compared to the CL. Speaking of the CL, I sure have high hopes of advancing even deeper into the CL as we have shown to be able to beat Bayern in group stages. I do hope we at least get to the semis and try our best.

2.) #Aguero. He is the spotlight this year and his performance post-injury will be crucial to our run, without him last half season we sometimes struggled to get goals in, hopefully the beast in Aguero will earn him a good performance this season.

#Caballero. Our new keeper will be challenging Hart on all fronts, his performance will need to be spectacular which means we will have a much stronger defence in front of goal. Looking forward to his showcase of skill and stability.

#Mangala.

**Short list of concepts that are incomprehensible to Americans.**

1. Risk-pooling. AKA the most basic foundation of any insurance scheme for any reason.

2. Law of large numbers.

3. Health care delivery that doesn't function as a series of niche boutiques within individual stores, vertically integrated or not.

4. Prior to 01/01/2014 when the provision of the ACA that forbids denial of health insurance coverage due to ""pre-existing conditions"" actually became law, the only ""competition"" in health insurance was between potential coverage purchasers. They were literally competing against one another for the privilege of purchasing something that might prevent them from being bankrupted by medical bills.

City has no major losses off of a returning champion, and the team has another year of familiarity with Pellegrini's system. City's depth will allow them to be competitive in league and in cup. Should be in the thick of it for the premier league, but Arsenal, Chelsea, and United all got better. 
Top 4 Finish, out of group stage in the Champions League.

2.) Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why?
Fernandinho: Last season's biggest addition, the team's success was often driven by the performances of the holding midfielder. With the addition of Fernando, Dinho will not have to be such a workhorse and can save himself a little more for big matches.

Samir Nasri: Nasri's career was rejuvenated by the manager change; a massive force on the attacking end, Samir can facilitate and create for himself. It remains to be seen how Nasri will respond to being left off of the French National Team.

Eliaquim Mangala: A 21 one year old, unproven CB with a world of upside; with and aging/aged CB core, (Kompany and Demichelis respectively,) Mangala will need to grow up fast. IF Mangala is not ready to face Premier League level competition, then City could be in real trouble at center back.

Cutting costs recently so as to not handicap ourselves financially upon completion of our new stadium is the most preferable explanation for the lack of outgoing expenditure in recent times and i've posted before that this is what i think is the case here.

However.... Daniel Levy has been here since 2001 and the very first job on his list back then was to secure a new stadium for us.

It has taken him 13 years to secure the go-ahead for a new stadium and it'll take a few more before it's completed. 

Can we hope to SERIOUSLY compete with the top of the league every year when we refuse to outlay cash on players without offsetting that with selling off our best assets? Can we continue to afford bringing in a new manager and system everytime our short term goals are not met?

We can't.

I appreciate the business model as it is. Bringing in 3 prospects and a back up keeper at the expense of 3 players we aren't going to use is to be applauded. If we could just outlay the money on a player that would push us forward right now though.... That would only put us further ahead in the long run. We're not that far away squadwise.

I guess my issue is the lack of communication from the club. If we were certain that Levy and co had our best interests at heart (not their pockets) then it'd be golden.

What's key about this is the 3 in midfield have to be mobile enough to cover the wingers when they get caught on the counter, while also having the numbers advantage in midfield. 

I think the system against Dortmund will be our first choice, because its strong in defense, on the counter and when in possession. Also, having the 3 in the midfield mean there's more cover if we get caught on the counter and that there is more options for Gerrard when he is pulling the strings from the back.

I think Hendo and Can are fabulous supporters to Gerrard in midfield, because they are both big, imposing figures with stamina, pace and power.
