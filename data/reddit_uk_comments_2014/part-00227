**A FATHER killed a violent thug who robbed his son of his iPhone at ­knifepoint.**

Derek Grant traced Patrick Bradley using an app that revealed the gadget’s location.

Grant confronted Bradley, who stabbed him in the eye. Grant then repeatedly stabbed Bradley, who died later of cardiac arrest.

Grant yesterday admitted culpable homicide at the High Court in Glasgow.

The tragedy began on August 30 last year when Grant’s son, politics student Jordan, 20, was robbed by Bradley in Greenock on the way home from work.

Jordan went home and told his dad, who discovered the iPhone was nearby using a Find My iPhone app.

Grant then left his home in the town’s Wellington Street with Jordan and his two younger sons Lee, 17, and 16-year-old Jamie.

They spotted Bradley, who had a significant record for violence, and Grant told him to hand back the phone.

Bradley, 29, instead lashed out and knifed Grant in the left eye.

He retaliated and repeatedly stabbed Bradley with a knife he had taken from home because he feared for his safety.

Father-of-four Grant was arrested and later said: “I wish to declare for the record that at the time of this ­incident, I was acting in self-defence.”

He had faced a murder charge but prosecutors accepted his guilty plea to the reduced charge of culpable homicide.

His three sons were also accused of murder but their not guilty pleas were also accepted.

Ian Duguid, defending, told the court his client only lashed out as a “reaction to the extreme violence” he faced.

The QC also said Grant, 38, had been forced to give up his job as a driver having lost the sight in his eye.

Judge Lord Boyd remanded Grant in custody and deferred sentencing until September 1.",0,1407324424,null,0,false,0,cjieq3f,t3_2crxqn,t1_cjieq3f,t1_cjie4pw,null,1435098398,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

And there's also a very nasty association with persecution in history of Jewish writers/artists/intellectuals.  Might not mean much to you, but I think it probably does mean a lot to Jewish people and to those who are familiar with history.

OK - so what about their claim that they would cover the funding shortfall?  This is in effect saying that Israeli government funding of the arts is 'blood money' which should not be accepted.  But there's no connection between the pot of money used to fund arts and that used to purchase military hardware.  Boycotts aren't about punishing the individuals responsible - they're about punishing *everyone* in the hope that it will weaken the government.

The point stands Israel has all of the power and in Hamas eyes will never peaceful let go of the hold it has over Gaza. Their motivations are understandable even as their actions are abhorrent. Just in the same way that Israel's actions are understandable even as their actions are abhorrent.

&gt;

&gt;The national __flag of Ireland__ ([Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *bratach na hÉireann*) – frequently referred to as the __Irish tricolour__ – is a vertical [tricolour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricolour_(flag\)) of green (at the [hoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_terminology#Description_of_standard_flag_parts_and_terms)), white, and orange.  

&gt;The proportions of the flag are 1:2 (that is to say that, as flown horizontally, the flag is half as high as it is wide). The Irish government has described the symbolism behind each colour as being that of [green representing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green#Nationality_and_politics) the [Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Ireland) tradition of Ireland, [orange representing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(colour\)#Politics) the followers of [William of Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England) in Ireland, and [white representing the aspiration for peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White#Government_and_politics) between them. 

&gt;Presented as a gift in 1848 to [Thomas Francis Meagher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Francis_Meagher) from a small group of French women sympathetic to the Irish cause,   it was not until the [Easter Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Rising) of 1916, when it was raised above the [General Post Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Post_Office_(Dublin\)) in Dublin, that the tricolour came to be regarded as the national flag.  Meagher was the son of [Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador)-born mayor of [Waterford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford), Thomas Meagher Jr, however there are two theories on his inspiration for the flag; the similarly-coloured [Newfoundland Tricolour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_Tricolour) credited in legend as having been created in 1843, though this seems unlikely given the actual known history surrounding the Newfoundland Tricolour, and the [French Tricolour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Tricolour).

Even if you think of our track record with Jan, Eriksen and Chadli it's obvious we're keen to dip into that Eredivsie Market more often than not, so it's a move I can see a youngster in the Dutch league thinking ''yeah, why not?''. And he'll for sure get games - it's Depay - Eriksen - Lamela. There's no danger of his talent stalling - I just hope he is somewhat humble and realizes that he either needs a move to a club like ours, or to stay at PSV but I hear he's quite over confident so who knows. 

He's not quite ready for a huge club, but he'll know in the back of his head even if things don't quite pan out with us results wise and he turns into Bale v2 (hoping Lamela beats him though) he'll still get a move to Madrid 4 years down the line at 24 - and London isn't bad. It pains me to say it, but really we're one of the best ''stepping stones'' in World Football with the training ground, location, not quite CL football but not mid table and I swear Real just have a quota to fill with our players. If only we could keep them before they left...

I just feel there's more in this one than Griezmann - just in terms of ''believably'' and the fact I'm pretty sure he's been linked too us during or pre-WC too? I dunno, just my gut says out of the 2 moves this is the one I can see happening more than Griezmann. By far.

What should be done is the demotion of Nolan and Carroll at this stage, one is injured and the other barely has the fitness to function let alone captain and lead the side. Following this a different structure in formation should be played with 2 forwards, supported by the midfield. Alas this won't happen under Sam. We have the chance and opportunity to field a great team here, with signings such as Zarate, Valencia, Cresswell etc all being important to the team dynamic. Existing players help greatly here too.

Why? Suddenly every confrontation that officer is involved in necessarily escalates to use of a gun. He has to. If somebody attacks him he either uses the gun or risks having it used against him. This turns non-deadly situations into deadly situations for no good reason. The very existence of the gun creates threat that isn't there otherwise.

This isn't a capacity issue. The basic principle on which the country treats guns is one of necessity. It doesn't matter if you can use a gun.

true,multijoy,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"Criminals can already get guns. They're not the average tool of choice because a) they're pricey and scarce b) you'll likely be shot if you're still holding it when the ARV turns up and c) you're going to go to prison if you're caught using one.

Arming the police won't increase the amount of guns in circulation (you can bet theft of an issue firearm would be a really serious issue, and the simple loss would be career ending) - the criminals aren't arming themselves to defend themselves from the police, they're arming themselves to carry out crime. You might get a small uptick within the serious and organised crime side, but the officers dealing with that are routinely armed anyway. 

What it will do is allow officers to defend themselves and you, the public, when it all goes bandy and not have the laughable situation of the Rigby killers hanging around waiting for an ARV to turn up, or Derek Bird not being able to be stopped until he'd committed more murders.

I reckon that 99.9% of weapons issued to the police are never fired outside of a firing range, just like CS is drawn once in a blue moon (and is usually discovered to be 3 years out of date) and batons are usually used to switch the projector on because nobody can find the remote. The issue is that armed cover is really scarce (especially outside of the metropolis) and 15 minutes is a long time to wait to have an armed unit running to you. 

A sidearm is only a novelty because nobody ever sees one. The airport coppers say that their job isn't hindered by the fact they're armed and they deal with domestics, petty thefts and missing kids on a day to day basis. PSNI (notwithstanding the 'unique' security situation) do the same job as their mainland colleagues whilst armed.

As far as I can tell, the only reason that it's an issue at all is because people think it looks oppressive, and even that's recent - it was as late as the seventies that firearms were issued as needed to ordinary constables.",1,1407327710,null,0,false,0,cjifjx9,t3_2crr1n,t1_cjifjx9,t1_cjif2uk,null,1435098798,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"&gt;Might not mean much to you, but I think it probably does mean a lot to Jewish people and to those who are familiar with history.

That was rather uncalled for. For your information, I am British Chinese, and my ancestors have known plenty of persecution from a wide variety of people, not least including the British. But I don't call anyone who disagrees with me a racist, and I am perfectly capable of distinguishing between opposing the Chinese **government** and discriminating against Chinese **people**, two very distinct things.

From what I read in the article, there is no boycott of Jewish artists/intellectuals, there is a boycott of Israeli money (not **Jewish** money, **Israeli** money) and to me, these are two very distinct things. The funding offer means that money is not the issue, and the history of the theatre with the group means that religion is not an issue. It's the source of the money that's an issue.

Whether it's really blood money or not is obviously a subjective assessment, but there's no arguing the fact that the Israeli government has a controversial public connotation due to what's going on in the Middle East. I should correct my earlier statement that they are opposing the Israeli government. Now that I think more about it, I think that maybe it is more about distancing itself, just as any company would seek to distance themselves from any controversial public figure or organisation.

Perhaps it's really less about effecting social change, and more about reducing PR risk.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I'm not questioning the reality that we may be interested in Depay, i would actually almost guarantee that we are interested.  Like you said, numerous things point to Depay being of interest and Spurs being willing to do business in the Netherlands.

I question where **the story** is coming from and that it bears a bit of a similarity to the Griezmann stories.  Note with the Griezmann stories that they were all ""broken"" by authors who do not have a track record of reporting on Spurs with any frequency and even less of a track record of reporting on Spurs with any accuracy. Everything with Griezmann pointed to his agents feeding information to the press to build some momentum around a potential move.

Depay made a statement last week saying that he would be willing to move to a bigger club and a bigger league. Prior to that he had been in the news when a story about LvG telling him to stay at PSV had been circulating.  Then yesterday a reporter from Goal.com printed an ""EXCLUSIVE"" story about Spurs having put in a bid and using the same quotes that Depay had made the week before. Incidentally the ""exclusive"" story comes from an author who doesn't normally cover Spurs or for that matter PSV. If it was truly a ""Exclusive"" story and the information was coming from inside Spurs wouldn't it more likely come from Stobart who has a pretty bang on record with us, who is known to be connected to the boardroom and often can be seen sitting in the directors box at WHL would be the one to break it?

This story was picked up in the Netherlands and carried yesterday and now today De Telegraaf (a paper who's reliability on stories like this sits somewhere close to the Sun and the Mirror) picks it up, yet the information doesn't seem to be coming from people who normally report with any accuracy on either Spurs or PSV.  The story was also covered by the London Evening Standard this morning by ""Standard Staff"" as the author of record. So if the information is not being provided to the journos from sources inside the clubs where is it coming from? Well, there is one other source available.....the agent(s).

I don't question that we may have interest in Depay. I question that we have made an offer since the story is coming from unreliable or uncredited sources which usually screams the work of agents.

I think Depay wants to move, I think Depay's agents see that they have an opportunity to cash in on his performance at the WC, i think Depay thought he was going to join LvG at United. When LvG said Depay should stay at PSV until at least January i think Depay and his agents made a decision to ring the dinner bell and see who comes in to see what is for dinner so they are feeding stories to less connected journos so the story is prominent.",0,1407328196,null,0,false,0,cjifp1f,t3_2crqmn,t1_cjifp1f,t1_cjif1z6,null,1435098906,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I can't help but agree with one of the comments:

.

&gt; Everton have, currently, got a small squad and are playing in 4 different competitions.

&gt; Nobody is doubting your talent, i just feel you need a few more big players . 

&gt;Van Gaal seems to have set Utd up in a way that means they won't leak goals very often and still employ 2 great strikers so could take 4th

&gt; Chelsea's team is just ridiculous.

&gt;City - see Chelsea

&gt;Arsenal's team is more balanced and exciting than i've ever seen it and i think they'll take 3rd

&gt; Liverpool will not be the team they were, but nor will they slip too far (5th i reckon)

&gt;Spurs are the only real question mark for me.
So you'll either finish 6th or 7th

.

I would love to see some quality players added to our ranks to ease the inevitable burden these 4 competitions will take on us. Only then would I consider our prospects in staying on top of the above mentioned sides.

true,Sell200AprilAt142,english,"England (Liverpool, City of London, Bournemouth)","&gt; Because with so many letting agents, tenants now believe the only way to get a house is to go through a letting agency.

Well, possibly, but I don't think that's likely.   I think renting directly from landlords _does_ occur to people - they just find it hard to get connected to them.  And have doubts over trusting an unknown landlord with a deposit protection scheme etc.   Having said that, I know many people who rent directly from their landlord and in most cases found them through online services like gumtree.   However, having attempted to use gumtree when I was looking for a place (and hoping a potential landlord would contact me while I look at other ads) I was disappointed instead to receive 3 invitations from various conartists.   I can see why people prefer to put a flesh and blood middleman in between them as would-be tenants to filter out most of the time wasters.

&gt; As I said, that only applies to Landlords who don't want to be landlords.

Or don't have time to be there because of work etc.   Offering to do a time consuming task for someone else for a charge is a legitimate thing to do - many many people obviously find it handy...

Remember many landlords don't earn their income from letting.   Often the rent income just covers much of the mortgage payment.  And they've moved elsewhere for work / family etc.

&gt; AFAIK, that entails doing to a credit check provider, putting in a name and address (Capita charge around £1 /address for credit check IIRC). But agencies like to sell this as some daunting extensive challenge out of reach of mere mortals and charge £50+ for what is essentially 3 minutes work + a £1 fee.

People will pay for someone else to do almost anything where there's the potential to do a part wrong and screw up big time.   Have you seen how much people will pay to have their tax self-assessment done for them?

&gt;  If the landlord does these things, there's no room for legal disagreement.

I meant problems with the tenants.... (non payment of rent, damage to property, noise problems, legitimate complains from neighbours etc).   All good reasons to spend a relatively small amount to have a middle man whose job it is to be slightly more familiar than yourself (as a landlord) about these things.

&gt; Even if they DID perform those tasks, the price charged is far far in excess of the actual time and effort invested in that particular property by the agent. 

Then it ought to be trivial to setup a new estate agent and undercut all of them...

&gt; The idea that ""we should charge our customers for all our failed attempts at getting money because they have no choice but to use us"" is basically extortion and textbook definition of racketeering.

Well, fine.   If you prefer a world where you pay £20 just to _look around_ a place (each place), but there's no contract signing fee, then... I guess...   But it would never work in practice because people would never answer that ad.   And even if they did, it would be in the letters interest to not actually let it out but just keep endless viewers looking around.   No.. much better to do all that up front work for free til the tenant with the best offer emerges and then they pay for the cost of the estate agents work showing everyone else round.

Or, you know, have the landlord pay that cost.   All of this is possible but remember it's just driven by competition and at some point any work done needs to get paid by someone who benefits from it.   Agents try to be competitive to landlords by keeping their percentage take down and passing the setup and signing costs on to tenants.   If it actually helped get more deals done them I'm sure agents would pass that cost on to everyone equally who viewed properties.   But since that's not workable, then the person who's successful in getting the flat is the person who pays for the overhead.   

Again, if there's an obvious better way of doing it then it should be easy to take the market by storm - people dislike estate agents.   If it were possible to run a good one in a cost effective way then some good person ought to do it.

&gt; We only need a fraction of the letting agencies we have at the moment for that though, not one on every street corner giving the impression that if you don't use a letting agencies you'll end up homeless.

They really wouldn't be there unless there were plenty of landlords willing to part with 10%+ of the rent income...  The fact there are so many should tell you either:

1. Landlords don't care about money and find it easy to say good bye to 10% of their income (unlikely)

2. OR landlords would very much prefer to pocket that themselves if they could, but marketing a property, finding a tenant, and dealing with the paperwork is genuinely more work than it sounds

true,ParkaBoi,null,null,"1. Good, reasonable areas include Hanover, Preston Park, Preston Circus and Kemptown. The centre has got really expensive recently and Hove, where I live, is going that way too. Further areas to avoid are Hangleton, Portslade (sometimes euphemistically referred to as 'West Hove') and Moulscombe. AND STAY AWAY FROM WHITEHAWK.  
  
2. If you can find a one bed flat for less than £750 you'll be doing well. There are some absolute shockers out there so be careful.  
  
3. American Express in Kemptown and EDF in Portslade have traditionally been easy to get work at. It's call centre stuff so don't expect much. (My info might be a little out of date here.) There's also loads of hotels and restaurants but this work tends to be seasonal.  
  
4. I'd be more inclined to go round the agencies with my CV before I approached the shops directly.  

One thing I've learned about Brighton, knowing the right people here is more important than qualifications and CVs (within reason). There's a big digital (what we used to call 'new media') presence in Brighton. You'd be well served to having a look at Wired Sussex jobs - [www.wiredsussex.com/jobs/jobsearch.asp](http://www.wiredsussex.com/jobs/jobsearch.asp) and seeing if there's any entry level stuff there. Then trying to work up from there.   

Finally, Brighton and Hove is a great place to live. I came here in '96 to study and I stayed for a long time. I left for a few years but I missed being here so much that I came back for good last Easter. I've tried living in lots of places in the UK, this is by far the best.

FIGURES released by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for the most serious rip-off of small British businesses in recent years — the mis-selling of interest rate swaps — reveal how the banks behind the mis-selling are being protected by their loyal servants in the big accountancy firms.

Last month Eye 1370 reported on the plight of Kent marina business Port Medway Ltd, which wasted £2,000 a month on interest rate swaps and was prevented from pursuing obvious and already planned development opportunities. While its bank, Barclays, did agree to repay mis-sold swap fees, it refused to pay for any damage caused to the business under the ""consequential loss"" arrangements devised by the FCA to deal with the multi-billion pound scam. ""Independent reviewer"" KPMG approved this refusal by Barclays' without even looking at Port Medway's claim.

Port Medway is not alone. More than 2,000 businesses have submitted consequential loss claims, 400 of which have been admitted. In total they have received just £700,000; but even the derisory £1,800 average belies the true picture. According to Berg, the Manchester law firm representing many of the businesses, the total reflects just one or two big settlements, while everybody else has received next to nothing, or maybe just reimbursement of extra bank fees.

All the cases have been approved by the so-called independent reviewers — generally the accountancy firms KPMG and Deloitte, who refuse to consider evidence from businesses that have been ripped-off and instead just use information from the banks. The banks, of course, are the biggest source of fees for the accountants who act either as auditors, tax advisers or, all too often, as administrators brought in to struggling businesses (many of which have been driven to the wall by predatory bankers) to ensure the banks if nobody else get their money back.

Everyone naturally wants the best weapon.  They certainly have a valid input, but this is a much bigger issue than one of just letting them get on with their job the best way they see fit.

In my opinion the only time we sold allow the police to deploy guns is if there are other guns (bombs, swords etc) in the hands of the bad guy.  Otherwise the issue can be solved with existing equipment and techniques.  Maybe it's more difficult and dangerous, but so be it.  It's policing by consent.

You feeling that on the streets is OK because it's been OK in airports and the like is the very reason armed officers have been put in airports. It desensitises all of us to this.

The reason we don't need police walking around the streets with guns is it has no possible way to end ""well"". How, in any sense, is it better for the police to be able to kill you in the street by pushing a button (pulling a trigger)? The only possible outcome of this, is at some point someone innocent is going to be shot. 

In the current ""armed units"" situation, we have incredibly highly trained officers holding guns. Officers with very specific targets and surrounded by other officers controlling the situation. Even then, there is much debate as to how many innocent people have been injured and killed in this line of work.

Arming, joe bloggs, officer on the street is a marked worsening of this situation. These officers have much less training than Armed Responce Units (ARUs), they must have less because they spend more time on the streets. These less trained guys are surrounded by angry drunk members of the public regularly. Snatch the gun etc?

&gt; Liverpool have completed their seventh signing of the summer after landing Javier Manquillo on an unusual two-year loan from Atlético Madrid. The 20-year-old defender underwent a medical on Merseyside earlier this week and has finalised a transfer from the Spanish champions that may **allow Liverpool to make the deal permanent, for a fee of around £5m, should he settle in English football. Atlético can break the loan arrangement and recall Manquillo for a fee next summer while Liverpool have an option to buy the player outright in 2016.**  
  
This means that they can pay a fee and take him back next July, but I am curious what the conditions around that clause are. If it is down to the player to decide whether to stay then we have a chance, otherwise we may give him time as a RB, find out he is good and the Atleti will take him back in 2015 before we can sign him in 2016, which is very good for them.   
  
If the clause allows him to reject a return to Atleti in 2015 even if they want him back and stay on until we sign him in 2016 then that will be in our favour as we can ""convince"" him to stay, by offering higher wages when we sign him in 2016.

I want to see special Newsnights and Panorama's dedicated to the issue, I want to see debates on Question Time and the Sunday morning shows. I want there to be a discussion about this before we blindly walk into it. I want studies about the need, and I want studies about the effects. I want to know who has control over these decisions (is it our barely-elected PCCs? Parliament? Force senior officers?). What are the rules of use? At what point is an officer allowed to draw their weapon? Does drawing automatically imply firing? 

I am open to it, if it's necessary. If inner city police are constantly running into armed criminals while they have a spray and a long aluminium stick and they *need* to start carrying for their own safety... I'm okay with that. 

There is so much that I don't know about this issue because it's not being discussed, I haven't looked into the data, I haven't been informed by the media or my government about why this is a necessary step.

I don't regret those years of my life, especially because I managed to spend a long DJ career completely sober, without even beer to provide me with the energy to perform in front of people who were paying good money to see me play.  The ""scene"" helped me grow as a business man and performer, and I learned skills and drive that I today still use within my current career and home life.  For me it was akin to theater or being in a professional musical group, to which I learned I got out of what I put into it.

&gt;The term __British subject__ currently refers, in [British nationality law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law), to a limited class of people defined by Part IV of the [British Nationality Act 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981). Under that Act, two groups of people became ""British subjects""; the first were people from the Republic of Ireland born before 1949 who already claimed subject status, and the second covered a number of people who had previously been considered ""British subjects without citizenship"", and were not considered citizens of any other country. This second group were predominantly residents of colonies which had become independent, but who had not become citizens of the new country. The status cannot be inherited, and is lost on the acquisition of any other citizenship; it will therefore cease to exist on the death of the last remaining subjects.

We constantly dog on GJ for being wildly inconsistent, and then we can't recognize consistency from a player like Lavezzi.

He's far from past it, based on numbers, and he's shown to be a consistent producer.

You can certainly say that Sanchez has better numbers than Lavezzi in the last two years--and there's no doubt about that. Sanchez had the best year of his life last year. I suspect that if you took it out of his career, his numbers would be inferior to Lavezzi across the board.

In any case, it isn't about whether or not Lavezzi is better than Sanchez. I really get frustrated with this sub sometimes. My entire point is that Lavezzi (114 goals in 414 appearances, .28 goals per game) has a better strike rate than Sanchez (93 goals in 382 appearances, .24 goals per game), and Sanchez isn't always a winger. Yet, people insist Lavezzi ""doesn't score much."" That's just silly. He averages just over 10 goals a season and nearly 9 assists per season.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; Well, possibly, but I don't think that's likely. I think renting directly from landlords does occur to people - they just find it hard to get connected to them. And have doubts over trusting an unknown landlord with a deposit protection scheme etc. 

Having moved from a uni city with 2 letting agencies and lots of private landlords, to a city with 115 letting agencies, and having helped maintain 4 properties for 15 years over the period including the letting agent boom, I can say that it is likely. And the reason it's hard to get in contact is because tenants assume and are told by agencies that agencies are a required part of the process so don't bother looking for private ones.

The deposit protection scheme is setup such that you don't have to trust the landlord. If you don't get your letter addressed to you with your receipt, you explain to your landlord that he's liable for fines of up to £2k (IIRC) or proceed to the CAB.

&gt; However, having attempted to use gumtree when I was looking for a place (and hoping a potential landlord would contact me while I look at other ads) I was disappointed instead to receive 3 invitations from various conartists. 

As an aside, I'd love to hear more about these conartists - how did they try to swindle you?

&gt; I can see why people prefer to put a flesh and blood middleman in between them as would-be tenants to filter out most of the time wasters.

Having signed contracts on a tenancy after travelling 300 miles to do viewings for a relocation, only to get home and get a call from the letting agent saying I can't have the house because the landlord signed with someone else. Or having another agency say ""yeah, you can take it, we'll contact you with forms and contracts"" and then hear nothing, in my experience, many letting agents are conmen/timewasters.

&gt; Or don't have time to be there because of work etc. Offering to do a time consuming task for someone else for a charge is a legitimate thing to do - many many people obviously find it handy...
Remember many landlords don't earn their income from letting. Often the rent income just covers much of the mortgage payment. And they've moved elsewhere for work / family etc.

They're the category of people I was referring to as non-professional landlords (E.g. being a landlord is not their profession). 

&gt; People will pay for someone else to do almost anything where there's the potential to do a part wrong and screw up big time. Have you seen how much people will pay to have their tax self-assessment done for them?

My point was that you can't screw up a credit check, it's literally a 20 second form. The only people that seem to manage to screw it up is letting agencies, and the only people perpetuating that it's something which can be screwed up, or something worth £30, is letting agents.

&gt; (non payment of rent, damage to property, noise problems, legitimate complains from neighbours etc). All good reasons to spend a relatively small amount to have a middle man whose job it is to be slightly more familiar than yourself (as a landlord) about these things.

That's fair play, I can understand that for non-professional landlords - as I said, people who want the money but not the work. IMO, that's like taking a job, and then paying someone else to do the job for you.

&gt; Then it ought to be trivial to setup a new estate agent and undercut all of them...

Except it's not, because the market is saturated in many places. 

&gt; Well, fine. If you prefer a world where you pay £20 just to look around a place (each place), but there's no contract signing fee, then... I guess...

I would be happy to live in a world where I'm charged for the services provided to me, rather then getting tiny freebies in exchange for everyone else's massive bills.

&gt; They really wouldn't be there unless there were plenty of landlords willing to part with 10%+ of the rent income... The fact there are so many should tell you either:
Landlords don't care about money and find it easy to say good bye to 10% of their income
OR landlords would very much prefer to pocket that themselves, but marketing a property, finding a tenant, and dealing with the paperwork is genuinely more work than it sounds

OR, they want to keep the money themselves, but the marketing and finding a tenant is now far harder and therefore costly than it was before due to so many letting agents springing up, leading tenants to assume there is no other way.

In light of that, this leaves landlords with 2 options: pay 10% to deal with agencies, or risk not letting the house out at all because of the agencies. Again, racketeering at it's finest.

And there *are* other ways this can be done without shafting both landlord and tenant. For example, it's illegal for letting agencies to charge any fees to tenants in Scotland. Sure, it's negatively affected the letting agency markets, but that's because the government realised the racketeering had gotten out of control and stepped in.

The idea that landlords and tenants have to pay far more than the value of the service provided simply because the business model is infeasible otherwise is ridiculous and a clear sign that it's not a business model that should be supported. 

Every single landlord I've spoken to who deals with agencies has nothing but complaints regarding the services and the cost. Every tenants I've spoke to has nothing good to say. Every landlord who doesn't deal with agencies has nothing good to say about them. Even the government has stepped in to try and curtail the exploitation. 

Yes, there is a desire for people to handle certain aspects of letting for the non-professional landlord, and yes, the modern letting agency is a solution. However, the majority of people will agree that in many cases it has created more problems than it's solved, making it, by definition, a terrible solution.",0,1407332951,null,0,false,0,cjihcvt,t3_2cmpu7,t1_cjihcvt,t1_cjig2gz,null,1435099832,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I come from a background where I've seen all sides of life, good and bad, and have seen some very close friends take different paths than I had and become ruined by drugs and drink at young ages.  This helped make me different choices and appreciate the other sides of life that they simply couldn't wrap their heads around.  This made experiencing the club scene a bit difficult for me, I'll admit, and is part of why I left it after spending many years of my early life within it.

The people, the music, the energy, the celebration of life was what kept my interest.  I loved supporting creative talents and doing what I could to help a young musician become a household name.  The community was always extremely motivated and excited to provide quality entertainment, and the musicians of that scene cared very much to be taken seriously in everything they did.  I savored the moments when a young fan would come up and tell me that what I did made a difference to them, and that after a long week or working a bad job and having a rough family life, my music would help them smile for a couple of hours.  THAT'S why I could put up with all the less than ideal stuff.

On the flip, it would break my heart to see a younger kid completely messed up on E/meth/coke and not be able to experience the same things I saw... but yet understood that it might be the way they needed to experience it for their own reasons and learn their own lessons.

I consider popping into a club while in London a bit of a trip down memory lane, and to show my wife a bit about my past that she wasn't a part of.  That part of my life is long gone (I retired from DJ'ing before I met her), but I certainly am excited to see how things have changed and adapted to the new generation.  In the 14 days I plan to spend in the UK this fall, popping into a club would be a fun thing to do for us for a couple of hours while coming back from a dinner or show that was a little more mundane.  The rest of my time there, I assure you we'll be spending time in the train enjoying board/card games and the scenery, going on lovely hikes and meeting new friends along the way.  :)",0,1407333069,null,0,false,0,cjiheo0,t3_2copdu,t1_cjiheo0,t1_cjigyef,null,1435099866,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

If I recall, there was this article last year that compared Webb to other referees, in terms of calls given. And it was found that post 2010 final, Webb stopped giving critical calls that might affect the game. 

A penalty in the last minute that would lead to a draw instead of a win? Not given. No red cards at start of the game and so on. He kept the game going and never gave any decisions if he felt it'll change the game so as to avoid criticism I guess. 

I'd agree with you, Pre-2010 Webb was amazing, Post though, he's been rather mediocre.

Tasers are an interesting one. I can see the benefits of them, but they can do quite a lot of damage, and do present police with an option that they wouldn't have had before. That's good in some respects though I suppose. However, whenever there's an article on tasers, it always surprises me how much use they've got since they've been bought in, and makes me think ""if they didn't have the tasers, how would the situation have been resolved?"" 

Interesting to hear your perspective. What you're saying regarding most criminals normally not wanting to harm police officers confirms my belief that the current model of speciality firearms units for emergencies is suitable for the UK. It does feel like there's been a few high profile police shootings over the past few year. I could understand if it keeps creeping up, it would become more and more justified for police to carry weapons, but I don't think we're there yet.

Sorry about the gun crime you guys do have to deal with - I hope it's not affected you too personally. Nobody deserves to be shot, especially the majority of police officers who are just trying to help:/

&gt; The service life of the filter cartridge depends on the local water quality: if your mains water contains a carbonate hardness of 12 to 14.5° EH (degree of clarke hardness), then the filter cartridge should be replaced after a consumption of 100 litres of water

Rangel is first choice, but his pace has been shown to be lacking over the last few years. 

Tiendalli is a bit of a liability in my opinion, I'm not confident over his tackling always holding my breath when he follows an attacker into the box. Crossing also isn't one of his strong points. He did have a strong game against Reading according to the reports.

Maybe worth strengthening this position, but I doubt Tiendalli would want to move to a new club seeing as he joined us out of retirement and has 2 years left on his contract.",0,1407334204,null,0,false,0,cjihvvm,t3_2cscub,t1_cjihvvm,t3_2cscub,null,1435100230,3,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,3

* Currently now LFC are paying his wages.

* In a years time (2015) Atletico will have the opportunity to pay a fee to be able to pay his wages again. 

* If Atletico do not exercise their recall option, LFC then will have the opportunity to pay a fee to continue to pay his fees after the second year (2016).

* If LFC do not exercise that option, then Atletico will return to pay his wages at no extra fee.

Really weird deal, hard to see who is benefiting financially from it. Strictly speaking the club the player is departing should always be the benefiter but imagine if the kid has an amazing season and Atletico use their recall option, then LFC receive a small fee for a player that technically belonged to the paying club. Mindfuck of a deal. 

**EDIT**: I think also we should all bear in mind that we are dealing with a club that signed Demichelis on a free from Mangala last summer transfer window and sold him to Man City in the same window.

The United States did not accept the automobile very easily. The Farmers Anti-Automobile Association from Pennsylvania drafted a list of essential requirements for cars, including a rocket to be fired out mile, and a blanket to cover the vehicle when horses approached as such painted so it blended in with the environment. If horses were unwilling to pass the car, the FAAA also required the car to be taken apart and hidden.

Very glad to hear Williams signed a new contract with us. Wouldn't be surprised if the big guys didn't put a great offer for him, so he held out with the hope of more money from us. It is what it is. He is a strong leader and some of his anticipation and interception play is great. First choice.

Chico would also be my first choice. While he can live dangerously when it comes to being physical with an attacker, he is good with the ball at his feet and not afraid to move forward with it - Although at times too far forward.

Barkley is tall, strong and did well at Birmingham last season. Would be my first pick to partner Williams if Chico is injured. Doesn't stay on his feet too much which could prove tricky against some of the better teams. Needs to work on challenging better for the ball because he has the workup to grab a good number of goals from set pieces.

true,seandalai,,Co.Cavan,"I actually cant believe what that women just said. Fuck me, she is so far of the mark and it's hard to believe that there are people so uneducated about history yet they preach it. 

I might be wrong here but I think she is claiming to be a descendant of the first Mesolithic population to arrive on the island and I'm guessing she's believes that Mountsandel is the earliest evidence of humans on the island (does she think then that they originated in Scotland or what?). Following on from that she must be claiming that the Ulster Meso population that became the farming community during the Neolithic period responsible for the Megalithic tradition are of her stock. From there I guess she is still the bloodline that become the Ulaid in the Táin Bó Cúailnge defending Iron Age Loyal Ulster from a Wee republic southern celtic invasion around the year 500-300 BC. Then I guess she is the Scoti that culturally expanded in to Scotland spreading Christianity to the point that the Picts abandoned their own language for gealic. Finally her clan was planted in her promised homeland the 6 counties whose borders were scribbled on an inaccurate map of Éire in Westminster some 90 years ago. 

Am i right ? is that the version history that some loyalists follow ? I know their was that whole British-Israelite movement that desecrated the ancient site of Tara looking for the ark of the covenant in the early 1900s. Then a terrorist group called Tara aligned them selves with this British Israelite idea during the troubles but fell apart because the leader was a pedo. Does Ruth also think she is part of the lost tribes of Israel ?

 
Well for starters the southern most counties where not covered by Ice and may have been inhabited during the Ice Age when Éire and Briton was still joined to the continent.  
Following the Ice melting people would have migrated North (from the south) as the sea levels rose and animals plants took over the Island. The earliest evidence we have for humans is in cork (genetics suggest that these people came for Spain and Portugal). There is also preIceAge evidence (meaning Paleolithic) but it's too scanty to be concrete. In the year 7000bc the people of all Ireland abandoned microlight technology however all the rest of Europe continued with its use making this the first time that the people of Éire were united. In Cork in Ferriters Cobh we have a Meso date for cattle bones representing an early attempt at farming however it failed but it is evidence that farming may have originated in Cork first. 

We also have some very early dates in Sligo regarding megaliths and some archaeologists propose that the entire Atlantic megalithic tradition may have started in Sligo during the Mesolithic period and moved east (because the oldest smallest and poorly built Megaliths are in the West and the later bigger and more technologically advanced megaliths are in the East) but its still a far fetched theory. Genetics suggest that farming was largely adopted by the Meso community rather than an invasion by Neo communities. 

The Iron Age Celtic invasion is a complete and utter myth. As with farming during the Neo period their was a cultural expansion rather than an invasion and genetics prove this. The Táin Bó Cúailnge was most likely written in the Early Med (I wish it was Iron Age but I dont think it is) and therefore could not be a battle between an invasive Celtic peoples (that never invaded Éire anyway) and a native population in ulster. We adopted the La Taine and Hallstatt artistic styles but there was never a Celtic invasion, that is just a common misconception. 

Science Bitches !!!

Hi there! 

I'm not a student in Edinburgh but have lived here for a while and will try to answer your questions:

*Living cost*

Rent is expensive here and council tax. I shared a 3 bedroom flat with friends and we were paying: £350 each rent, £43 council tax, £30 gas/electricity, £12 phone/broadband. Food here is also expensive but if you shop smart, cook your own meals in bulk you can easily get by on £15 a week.. Personally I'd allow about £30-40 a week. Lets say £100 a month too for actually having fun :P So that's: £655 a month for flat, food and fun. I think you could easily get by on £500 a month if you have a bike and found a cheaper flat! Have a look at rental prices and people looking for flatmates on gumtree to get a better idea of what is suitable for you and what the price range is. 

If you don't mind cycling then you don't need any transport costs outside of getting a bike.. Edinburgh is pretty good for cycling if you don't mind the hills! Public transport here is £3.50 for a day ticket on the bus so even if you had to take multiple buses every day that's only £98 a month extra transport cost. The buses here are great and much cheaper than elsewhere... but like I say if you don't mind cycling and don't need to drive for work then I'd suggest going down that route.

*jobs*

It seems to depend... A lot of people complain about how hard it is but from personal experience and what I've seen of my friends... if you are quite proactive about it then it isn't any different to living anywhere else.

*uni*

I know there are a large number of Edinburgh students who read reddit, but this subreddit doesn't see much action.

Might be worth your time looking at glasgow Uni as well... It is also a good university with a nice campus. I find the nightlife more appealing in glasgow with pub/clubs being a bit cheaper and a wider selection of decent live music (Excluding Edinburgh festival in August). There is more of a music ""scene"" there and people tend to be a bit friendlier. The flats are also cheaper to rent and tend to be larger :). Of course Glasgow has it's downsides too!

Ki was great on loan at Sunderland last season. With Britton's injury I expect him to start most games and will be good enough to prevent Britton getting back into the team when he's better. Had a bit more movement under Poyet than he will under Monk as I expect Shelvey to move forward more oftern and he'll have to cover.

I think this season could be a breakout season for Shelvey. Ki will give him more flexibility and Siggy will nearly always be available for the easy pass. I hope Montero mimics Routledge's runs behind the defender because with his pace and Shelvey's passing ability it could be deadly combo. He will be disappointed losing free kick rights to Siggy though.

Britton will be injured for the start of the season, but will always be trusted to come on during a game and restore momentum in the Swansea build up play.

Fulton can do a job, will most likely get a few opportunities under Monk to come in and be aggressive in the middle. Bright prospect.",0,1407336586,null,0,1407337969,0,cjiizpt,t3_2cscub,t1_cjiizpt,t3_2cscub,null,1435100886,5,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,5

A Gallup poll from 2011 revealed that [about half of Americans had a gun in their home](http://www.census.gov/popclock/), which at that time equated to 146 million people, if we include children. According to the 2010 census [a quarter of the population was under 18](http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf), so for the sake of argument let's say 109 million adults had access to guns.

But how many people were murdered by guns in 2011? According to Bloomberg it was [11,000 people in 2011](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-31/u-dot-s-dot-gun-homicide-rates-a-comparative-look), and it seems relatively safe to assume that most of these people were only shot by one person, so we have 11,000 gun murderers, give or take.

So of the 109,000,000 people who have access to guns in the US in 2011, only 11,000 committed murders with them. What was that you were saying about ""common sense""?

In addition they'd be entering into a literal arms race with organised criminals/gangs. That kind of escalation is not conducive to making the public feel safe. (Although perhaps that's the point?)

If this is just a case of the devil making work for idle hands, why not have the firearms officers secure their weaponry at the station (or in their response vehicle) and then just send them out on the beat with the standard taser/baton combo when they're not on call?

I will always be amazed with Dyer's ability to win flick ons against a lot of defenders. He has good foot work and his movement during 1-2's in tight spots is excellent. I can't help but think he'll be the one dropped out of the three this season - making second half appearances to change things up.

Routledge had a good end to the season last year and I was impressed with his workrate/ability to beat a man. I expect him to play on the right more this season while Montero takes the left because of his strange, DiMaria-esk, refusal to use his opposite foot to cross. Couldn't count the number of times he would beat a man down the line only to try and cross with the outside of his right foot. This usually meant the ball floated, wasn't quite in the right direction and because of the lack of power, could be defended easily. One thing that Monk tried last year was playing him off Bony, he looked dangerous but left a large hole on the left side - wouldn't be surprised to see that formation again.

Montero has looked exciting during preseason and appears to have been a good purchase. Very quick, has the ability to beat a defender, and score a goal. After watching some of his highlight clips from Spain and Mexico he appears to hold onto the ball maybe a little longer than he should, but I'm sure that's something our style could kick out of him. He could be very dangerous from through balls like Routledge and Dyer were last year.

I think we're quite flexible in terms of position with our wingers, except I don't remember seeing Dyer ever play on the left. Our passing play in the middle with Bony dropping deep caused many teams to play a high line against us last season, this allows ample room behind for Routledge and Dyer to run into - I hope to see us do this more often with Montero's pace. I'm very happy with the three players we have, but I expect we strengthen this position before the end of the window, unless Monk sees Emnes/Siggy playing wide when needed.

true,Sell200AprilAt142,english,"England (Liverpool, City of London, Bournemouth)","&gt; I can say that it is likely. And the reason it's hard to get in contact is because tenants assume and are told by agencies that agencies are a required part of the process so don't bother looking for private ones.

I can't believe people are _unaware_ of things like gumtree (honestly, there are tons of busy private letting sites).  More likely that many landlords simply opt for the services that estate agents offer.   You seem to be suggesting that the necessity of using agents if a myth perpetuated by agents themselves.   I'm sure they try..  but there's nothing forcing landlords to use them.  Unless, that is, the service they provide is actually useful.

&gt; The deposit protection scheme is setup such that you don't have to trust the landlord.

Yes I know.  I just listed it as a reason why tenants may be (rightly or wrongly) more comfortable with an estate agent involved.

&gt; As an aside, I'd love to hear more about these conartists - how did they try to swindle you?

I'd listed what we were after, the general area and a price range and got back some astonishingly good offers from would-be ""landlords"".   The flats were spacious and surprisingly cheap for their size.   I was also surprised that they hadn't come up on rightmove etc.  even as ""let"".   Except that one of them did, and the photos were from a flat that went for 3 times the rent some 6 months before.   I'd already replied to all the mail and the general gist I got back in each case was the following:

1. thanks for getting in contact, thank goodness, the tenant I had arranged fell through at the last moment!
2.  I'm a private landlord I don't like using estate agents (fees etc)
3.  I live abroad and manage the flat myself
4.  I'm desperate to get this let out by today (I'm old / frail / some sob-story etc) hence the good deal on the rent, if you make the deposit today, I'm flying over next week and will show it to you
5.  Deposit payable via Western Union transfer to....

So you'd have to be a mug to fall for that.   But by the number of them I received it seemed to be a common scam.  This was all in London.

&gt; Having signed contracts on a tenancy after travelling 300 miles to do viewings for a relocation, only to get home and get a call from the letting agent saying I can't have the house because the landlord signed with someone else. Or having another agency say ""yeah, you can take it, we'll contact you with forms and contracts"" and then hear nothing, in my experience, many letting agents are conmen/timewasters.

That sounds crappy, but I'm not sure how the first one was the agents fault.   Also in the second one, is this after you made a deposit?  I'm not saying there aren't crap agents, just that the costs of running a basic one are higher than people realise.

&gt; My point was that you can't screw up a credit check, it's literally a 20 second form. The only people that seem to manage to screw it up is letting agencies, and the only people perpetuating that it's something which can be screwed up, or something worth £30, is letting agents.

I'm not doubting it's simple if you know what you're doing.   Only that many people find themselves in the position of wanting to let out and are not comfortable that they would know/remember everything...

&gt; Except it's not, because the market is saturated in many places.

It's not saturated if you're offering your service at 50% or less of what the existing estate agents are...  Tenants would use a new estate agent if they charged no fees, and if your charge to landlords was 1% less then who wouldn't consider it?   It's just that I don't think that business model will pay for anyone to live well.   Or rather, that dealing with tenant problems is surprisingly time consuming for agents and gives rise to the extra cost.

&gt; I would be happy to live in a world where I'm charged for the services provided to me, rather then getting tiny freebies in exchange for everyone else's massive bills.

Really?   First flat doesn't look quite like the pictures, that'll be £20 for your trouble.   Next one get in to find the neighbours make noise - £20 thanks, next.  Third one the kitchen's too small - £20 etc.  No-one does this because no-one would go for it.  You don't know if you're going to look at 2 or 20 properties and people like to know their costs in advance even if it's high.  Besides - if the contract-signing charge covers actual costs then the agents (all of them) will just pass that on to the landlord if they're prevented from charging the tenant.   But if all landlords are seeing a small raise to their costs, there's no reason they won't all make a small raise to their rents to compensate.   It simply costs £X to go rent a flat, quite how the rent and fees are broken down is unlikely to alter that.   In all my years in London I've never had an agent who couldn't list all the costs in advance, which at least enabled it to be factored in when considering 2 properties will different agents.

&gt; OR, they want to keep the money themselves, but the marketing and finding a tenant is now far harder and therefore costly than it was before due to so many letting agents springing up, leading tenants to assume there is no other way.

This is the part I can't believe.   No-one's forcing landlords to use estate agents.  Nor are people ignorant of the alternatives.   If you as a private landlord put a flat to let on the market for 5-10% less than the general going rate except you only post it a) outside the flat, b) on gumtree (and openrent, rentfair, findaflat, landlorddirect etc) then I *cannot believe* you wouldn't be inundated (again, London though)   In fact the busyness of those sites shows you how successful they are.   The fact is that estate agents aren't forcing themselves on anyone, it's just they present a service to landlords that many choose to use, and deem the cost necessary.  But clearly the options are there for landlords to let in other ways, many just choose to sacrifice some of the rent to not ever have to answer the phone or show people round...

&gt; And there are other ways this can be done without shafting both landlord and tenant. For example, it's illegal for letting agencies to charge any fees to tenants in Scotland. Sure, it's negatively affected the letting agency markets, but that's because the government realised the racketeering had gotten out of control and stepped in.

Yes I think it would make things clearer that way, but I don't think necessarily cheaper.

&gt; The idea that landlords and tenants have to pay far more than the value of the service provided simply because the business model is infeasible otherwise is ridiculous and a clear sign that it's not a business model that should be supported.

But it's not being ""supported""?   There are no special laws stopping landlords going direct to tenants etc.  Only landlords willing to pay for convenience that estate agents offer.  If there's a shortage of property on direct sites, it's due to landlords wanting the convenience of estate agents.

&gt; Every single landlord I've spoken to who deals with agencies has nothing but complaints regarding the services and the cost.

What are their objection to 'going direct'?   What would a service need to do to guarantee their business?  What percentage of the rent would they be willing to pay?   Seriously.  If it's as easy as people say I'll consider setting one up on the side.   For x% I'll market your property far and wide, deal reasonably with tenants, make sure their concerns are brought to you swiftly, make sure they don't wreck the property etc.",0,1407338468,null,0,false,0,cjijx4x,t3_2cmpu7,t1_cjijx4x,t1_cjihcvt,null,1435101528,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Sounds to me like they are barring the whole film unless the UK Jewish Film Festival caves into their demands. They are forcing the festival organisers to take a stance against a country which is believed by many Jews as their homeland.

The organisers will not reject the funding from the Israeli Embassy because it will lose them hundreds of tickets from Jewish buyers. If I want to be really cynical about it (and given the firebombings, riots and boycotts going on in the rest of Europe, I think cynicism is an acceptable attitude), I'd say that this is a calculated risk by the Tricycle Theatre. They want no part in this film festival. They devised a way to get rid of the festival while at the same time making themselves look good by offering to foot the bill themselves.

But I'd bet everything I have that the festival organisers will not cave on this. They won't risk losing their Jewish audience just to keep one cinema.

I didn't say otherwise.

There is plenty of statistical data available about the [British public's](http://news.opinium.co.uk/survey-results/british-public-opposed-armed-police-force) and [police officer's](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19641398) views on armed policing and the majority do not want to see  more armed officers, especially not while carrying out routine duties.

&gt;Armed Officers have always carried out regular police duties when they are not being sent to somewhere for an 'armed reason'. I've seen Armed Police do everything from go on patrol to direct traffic.

But from a football perspective it would make sense as a straight replacement for Dzeko or Negredo, he's a major upgrade on both players. Slightly younger than both also IIRC.

true,badsyntax,null,null,"&gt;Theres nothing inherently dangerous about cycling. You should stop making out that everyone needs to be protected from ""heavy"" crashes every time they get on two wheels.

You don't need to have a heavy crash to hurt your head. For example, just this morning I fell off my bike at a slow speed. The roads were wet, I believe it was still raining lightly at the time. I was waiting for a light to turn green, and then proceeded to take a left turn. There was a metal gutter cover on the road, and as soon as my front wheel touched it, my bike slipped. This was totally unexpected. Due to some mad reflex skills (that I'm still impressed by), I managed to let the bike go horizontal while I jumped off the bike, and I found myself running down the road trying to reduce my momentum.

This is where things get a little technical. UK police do not use less then a level 3 retention holster (for open carry).

Level 1: these holsters don't actively retain your gun they normally work on friction to retain the gun in the holster.

Level 2: this type of holster provides an active retention feature, normally a lock which has to be disengaged via pressing a button. This button is along side the slide of the gun making it easy for the wears to active but not for another person.

Level 3: this type adds another layer of protection to the holster. Normally a hood which cups over the back of the slide. This has to be disengaged via another button before the going to the level 2 retention.

Here is a via by an American law enforcement officer who explains this. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qIXc9NRLRJI

It should also be noted that firearms in the UK are attached by lanyard to the officer disengaging this is after getting passed the holster before the officer has jumped on you isn't realistically going to happen.

Much like how Muslims will tend to be pro-Palestine, Jews will tend to be pro-Israel. Given Jewish history, the protection Israel offered after the Holocaust, and education (i.e. Jewish schools or Jewish summer camps), this isn't surprising.

So if you meet a Jew in the street, even if they aren't vocal about it, they will probably lean towards the Israel side of things. Unlike how a lot of people will consider themselves on the fence about the issue, the sort of ""neutral stance"" for a Jew will be Israel-leaning. So when a Jew is vocally anti-Israel it can be quite disconcerting. An extreme example of this is the Neturei Karta, an Orthodox Jewish group who are extremely pro-Palestinian (and have even been seen getting friendly with radical Muslims such as the leader of the Nation of Islam) because they believe that a Jewish state of Israel can only exist after the Messiah returns.

Regardless of what's going on in Israel, most Jews worldwide will essentially ""be on their side"". They may not support some actions, but no Jew wants to see Israel lose. So ""pro-Israel"" may actually be too strong a term. It's more comparable to being a citizen of a nation. I'm British but I am in no way nationalistic or ""pro-British"". I am appalled by many actions of the British government, but I still support England in the world cup and I don't want to see British soldiers die. It's that kind of support that is the minimum level most Jews feel for Israel.

So Jews have an affinity for Israel. Call it spiritual, cultural, historical, religious, whatever. So for many Jews, seeing that the Jewish Film Festival has agreed to this ""boycott"" Israel will definitely dissuade them from buying tickets. Again, I'm not saying it's all Jews.

Big fan of Sigurðsson, and expect him to do good things this year. Great on set pieces, decent passer and will most likely get a good few goals. We desperately needed multiple players to share the goal scoring requirements. Great acquisition. 

Emnes offers something different. His link up play last year with Bony was good, and he can also be very direct which is something we don't really get from many other central players. Good feet in the box which won us two penalties last year. Decent impact sub.

Shelvey is pretty much covered by the [CDM post](http://www.reddit.com/r/swanseacity/comments/2cscub/swansea_city_squad_depth_as_of_6th_aug/cjiizpt). He's a good play maker and has a very good shot on him.

I expect this position to vanish if we decide to play with two strikers. Most likely with Sigurdsson moving wide.

Most of the Liverpool pundits are from when Liverpool were really successful in the 80s, making their British players household names. TV pundits tend to be selected by their reputation and nationality over actual analytical ability, hence we get the likes of Shearer, Lawrenson, Ferdinand, Sounness etc.despite their inane insight.

Chelsea weren't especially popular until around the late 90s, where some well known players arrived but from abroad. We had the likes of Wise and Le Saux, but Wise has a bad reputation, and Le Saux was stigmatised basically because he was middle class and educated (more on that later?)

Perhaps in the future we'll see a few more pundits add to the occasional gigs from Nevin, Gullit and Wilkins. It seems likely to be after the recent surge in populalirity. 

You can currently observe how Man Utds retiring players from the 90s and 00s are beginning to replace the older lot from 80s Liverpools. Today Ferdinand and P. Neville have been announced for MotD in England, G. Neville's been at Sky.

Without the easy pundit job on the table after retiring from playing, I think a lot of players go into coaching to remain in the game. I also think that the British working class of the past has stigmatised higher education (Le Saux getting called homosexual for reading a broadsheet etc) and as a result can find it harder than their European peers at transitioning into management.

All in all it's one of the reasons I don't like english loan system, I would have introduced anti-wage incentive where the club pays wage proportional to the game time every week so if Ibe goes out on loan and plays 38 games of 90 minutes in the league Liverpool pay his full season wage, if he sits on bench for a whole season (unlikely, would be recalled) they pay the full wage (which is higher than most championship clubs pay). With Italians system they can include % of ownership and let him leave and buy him back if he improves.

true,Brickmaniafan99,cnty-expat,United States of America,"Seems like the logic here is: ""The police have guns, they're going to shoot me, They're criminals""

No, Police officers have certain situations they are trained for. They know what situations to pull the pistols out of their holsters and what to leave them in for. Only a trained person who was a former police officer would know how the holsters work. Nearly impossible to get out unless you are trained, and even then there is an angle like someone else mentioned. 

Police officers with pistols don't phase me. If criminals know the police are armed, they will be less likely to do the crime because they don't want to be shot. 

You really have nothing to worry about. Get over it and get used to it. Officers won't pull a pistol on you for a traffic stop of a fight. The only time the will use a pistol is if the suspect is armed. Even if the suspect is unarmed and they resist, the police will use a baton or a taser at the most, not a pistol. If the officer misuses his side arm, he should be punished for it.  


Guns aren't the problem. The problem is always the person behind them. Sometimes irresponsible people get a hold of them. Almost 100%  of the time the gun is acquired illegally. Even in the US, where anyone who is 18 and not a felon can buy one.

&gt; If those in on crime are putting someone's life in risk, the police should have the tools necessary to put that to a stop.

We already have that though. We have heavily trained ARUs, who are actioned to very specific scenarios. Even then, there is much public debate on how much force was really required. You as someone from the military knows how much training it takes to really use a gun in a public space effectively, do you really think Bobbies on the street can go through that much training? Certainly the ARUs do, but their ""day job"" is to continue training.

Also, as you've said, this isn't the wild west. In reality the number of people out there will illegal firearms is very low.

Also, do I need to point out that the price listed is £18 million, not £30 million? And give it up about Griezmann or Reus. They are not attainable. I'm not sure why this needs to be mentioned so often on this sub.

Anyhow, you can definitely criticize his wages, attitude, and ability to adapt to England. I think I made it clear that I'm fine with other criticisms.

Committal court cases are public, as are all criminal court cases. It would be impossible to not name them unless we started having secret trials. 

Being summonsed to court for non-payment is not the same as the Council petitioning to commit you to prison (which means a warrant for your arrest is then issued), that comes way further down the line. To be commited to prison you have to point blank refuse to pay or cooperate. Clearly the Councillors cooperated because it was all paid back.

What happened with the Councillors is they were summonsed for non-payment and paid it before the court date so at that point there was no reason to go any further. They didn't even issue a liability order because there's no outstanding debt to take to court.

In my case I was 17 and walking back late. Turned a corner to find a guy waiting for me and without warning he slashed me with a parang. He hit me hard enough for it to stick in the bone of my arm to which when I recoiled back in pain/shock he lost grip of it. Started swearing at the guy and he bolted as he no longer had a weapon. He'd obviously seen me earlier and figured he'd cut me off - luckily though it all went tits up for him. 

Klang in Malaysia has also given me some dicey experiences as I found a body on the Royal Yacht Club marina jetty with a piece of wood nailed to its head with my Grandfather. 

Earlier this year I was also bottled by someone in Chang Kat for ""You look at my girl? Shit! You shit!"" for making eye contact with a girl at a table.

Eventually we put a sign in the window reading ""Hello [his first name]! Have you had a good look in? Knock and we'll show you around properly!""

A quick Google search shows that others have risen up and gobbled up the name since I retired, so everything I see out there now are people from other parts of the country.  I see a couple of random things that are still me, but nothing of real proof of my career other than the design agency that created my CD covers.

I played mostly in Minneapolis in clubs like First Avenue (of Prince fame) and Quest Club, as well as a bunch of local raves and parties.  While I lived in the UK I was still just starting out so I hadn't played anything major there... but I was taken under wing by a couple of UK kids I was friends with who taught me plenty about DJing while I lived there.  We'd go out clubing and shopping at stores like Hard to Find Records in Birmingham.  Once back in the US, I secured a local radio show and played mostly British House and Breaks mixed together.  

As for who I played with, I shared bills with Krafty Kuts, Seb Fontaine, AK1200, Christopher Lawrence, DJ Dara, Tommie Sunshine, John Acquaviva, Dieselboy, Freddy Fresh, Brad Owen, Thee-O, Kenny Gino, Woody McBride, Diva D, Jack Trash, Spree, Speedy, Luna C, UFO, Omar Santana, Freaky Flow, Angel Alanis, Gray Area, Junkie XL, Paul Birkin, DJ StarScream (from Slipknot), and DVS-1.  

Not sure if many of these names would ring a bell, but all of them had pretty decent careers at the time in both US and UK scenes at the time.  I still hear from Freddy Fresh now and again, as I work with his nephew.  He's the one that gave me my first local breaks (pun intended) and introduced me to Krafty Kuts.

The mid 00's and late 90's was a great time to be involved in the electronic dance music scene, esp here in the US.  It's only been in the last few years that dance music has started to become mainstream here, so showing up to a club and playing something that wasn't hip-hop always turned heads in 1999.  Most local DJs were stern techno or house djs, but I was playing stuff that most of the locals in the rave scene didn't know existed, which was pretty fun, and it helped me gain some respect and plenty of gigs.

Eventually I got sick of staying up long hours or dealing with shady promoters and it was the rise in technology that eventually killed it for me.  Clubs stopped having turntables and everything changed to MP3 formats.  This took the soul out of playing IMO, and even though I played around with Ableton and Final Scratch to try and keep relevant, I sold all my equipment and walked away.  I can't say I really miss it, since it stopped being fun.  I'm 40 and have new priorities in life.  I'm just happy I had a brief taste of ""rock star"" life!!

As for recordings, I have a couple of live mixes floating around somewhere.  I'll try and upload a couple for you guys tonight since you expressed interest.

True, though I think it's our best ""similar"" case study. Maybe I should be looking to experiences in other parts of Europe where they have armed bobbies but not the issues I'm worried about.

&gt; it's standard practice to have a pistol attached to the officer

And even getting the gun out of another persons hands/holster isn't easy.

&gt; Probably wouldn't be just the one officer going to break up a drunken brawl, so their colleagues wouldn't let that happen, I should hope.

I would also hope not. Though I guess it's not the planned stuff I would expect to go wrong. It's the single or couple of bobbies who get caught up in stuff anyway. At the moment a collapsible baton is enough.

Hopefully we don't get into the position where a gun is a necessity. But I think putting guns on the street pushes us towards that, it doesn't move us away.

&gt; And how long they can take

Sadly true. But I don't think the fix to this is more bobbies with guns. Better communication and increased mobility maybe.

After we lost our main threat we should have looked for somebody else who would have a big impact on our attack line. We should have done it in FIRST PLACE. We are doing it now. Instead we went for other players and we can call them players mainly with great potential (not for now, but for future). I know they can turn into great players (Marković, Manquillo, we're after Moreno, there's also Can with who i really felt in love, but he's still a future player). There are also likes like Lovren (will have an impact on our defense, anybody would:D), Lallana (coutinho finally will have somebody to fight with for first team place) or Lambert (i like him, he's just somebody who will give us plan B). We also took Origi to secure our future - we did it when we even didn't secure our present)

Just to sum up - I don't like the fact that we did so many 'risky' and future transfers when we need quality for now.

If the government can block these new human rights laws, then clearly ""impose"" is the wrong word to use here.

Wait, I thought they were ""attempting to impose"" new human rights laws, not just discussing the possibility of introducing them?

true,meatwhisper,null,null,"The problem is that pre-internet, American mainstream music cared more about album sales than singles, so it was hard for an electronic artist to make an impact when most popular dj's only put out a song a year.  When an electronic artist did hit big in the US, it was someone like Daft Punk or Chemical Brothers who would put out full albums filled with quality tracks and made an experience from it.  However if someone like Oakenfold tried to release a full album, it would have his one or two good tracks we all know... but then 80% was hastily thrown together garbage that no one wanted to hear.  So the album would flop and they couldn't break into American mainstream music.  

In the UK, the market is far more singles driven, so if you liked a song, you could go out and pay a pound for a single and that artist was successful by releasing one or two tracks a year.  You could be a producer with a fantastic career and only really release 6-8 songs over the course of many years.

Then the internet happened, and suddenly Americans could go out and buy an Mp3 for a buck and the artist didn't need to put out a full album to release something in the US.  This helped the underground success of electronic artists into the mainstream, but even then the stuff that sees serious radio play is something with Pitbull in it.  So the hivemind has opened up to pop music that's faster than 80 BPMs, but they still don't go out of their heads for stuff like ""On A Good Day"" unless they are looking for it online or a friend hears it and passes it along.

As for Chicago and Detroit House, The thing to keep in mind is that house music and techno always had a underground movement, much like hardcore punk or any other kind of music.  As long as you had someone willing to throw a party, you had people willing to show up.  America is a very large country, and if someone was making waves in a local Minneapolis scene, they would be complete unknowns in Miami or Chicago for the most part unless that person was willing to travel and work their butts off to get gigs everywhere.  Chicago and Detroit ""did it first,"" and it inspired cities like mine to get involved and try to make our own thing happen.  

However your average young person these days could likely go their entire lives without knowing anything but the songs that get played on the radio.  If you want to get deeper into ANY kind of music, you have to look for it.  This is what was always so appealing to me about UK house... it was always there.  You turn on the radio, it's there.  You go into a club, and it's there.  If you wanted the top 40 schlock everyone else wanted, you almost had to go to a special club to hear it.  In the US, it's the exactly opposite.  Every club here plays the radio friendly hip-hop and pop... and you have to look for a specialty night somewhere to hear proper techno/house.

Wicked pace, puts in a good defensive shift when the fullback is caught forward, keeps his head up looking to make a pass ... and he *already crosses the ball ~~better than Lennon ever has~~ as well as Lennon did when he was at his best*. His particular strengths are suited to the Premier League. Did I mention he's only 20?

I like having a true wide option on each wing. We certainly could do worse than bringing in Yedlin to eventually replace Lennon. He could arrive in playing shape after the end of the MLS season/Cup (depending on how far Seattle goes), and he would have the remainder of our season to get acclimated.

Do it, Levy.

So the armed criminal has gone from a sawn off to self loading pistols, carbines and rifles. The good news is the weapons were quickly recovered but that is the reason why you will now see armed officers always carrying an SLP (with some exceptions where this isn't an issue).

The fact that he's scored a decent amount in the CL is a good indicator of quality and consistency. I personally just don't see not scoring enough as a valid criticism of Lavezzi. He doesn't score on the level of Reus or Sanchez in recent years, but Lavezzi is deployed differently and is virtually never played as a striker, which both of those players have been. 

Lavezzi has also proven himself to be capable of scoring in two different leagues, one of which is considered the best defensive league in the world. To me, this indicates consistent performance year-to-year.

Another thing to note is that he made more appearances than Reus, but about 400 less minutes of total game time. This indicates how often he was used as a sub. Per Squawka, his goals per 90 is .43. That's really good for someone who is a straight winger.

Is Lavezzi the best value in the market? No, but we don't seem to interested in or able to lure the best values in the market. But £18 million for a consistent, proven player is not that bad, in my opinion. His resale value is virtually nonexistent, but we don't really care, do we? We have loads of young attackers.

That said, this is a terrible, terrible idea. Absolutely no good will come of this. The UK is the one example of effective, positive gun control that I'll point to. In my mind, UK police are the friendly sort that say ""Stop being a twat Dave"" because he got a bit rowdy after having a few drinks; stuff like that gif floating around where a UK cop is holding up his hand to stop a motorcyclist and instead the motorcyclist high-fives him, after which the cops just laugh. 

In the US, police have two handguns and a tazer on them. In the I car they have access to an AR-15 and an 870 Winchester shotgun, both of which they can use based on their own judgement. People feel nervous and on edge around the police here- they're practically a military force. 

Why does all this matter? In the 80s, the US police only carried a .38 special revolver. That was it. Thats how it starts. Guns, while I love them, are a can of worms- once you open that can, you cant put them back in. Once police have guns, they stop being that friendly guy looking out for you and that alcoholic Dave- they put up a wall and keep their distance, because someone might go for their gun. People stop being people to them, and become potential threats. It will not make anyone feel safer if you arm your police on regular patrols. It will not resolve conflicts faster, it will only drive people to do more all-or-nothing type crimes. 

The UK feels like a safe, friendly place. Having the cops carry guns regularly will change that. ",0,1407351938,null,0,false,0,cjir903,t3_2crr1n,t1_cjir903,t1_cjidhq8,null,1435105221,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I haven't taken anything you have said badly or in a negative way at all. I used to live in England and still have family over there. I swear on everything, if my wife could either still work for the company she works for or could get a job on a similar level I would move us to England. I love it there. I took my wife for our one year anniversary, in 2009, and she fell in love with it too. She is from a small town and has only lived in her hometown, the town her college was in (also small) and now the Dallas/Fort Worth area. So that would be such a huge decision for her. Although we have discussed it a couple of times so she isn't opposed to it. 

I agree with ecerythibg you have said. I wish it was different over here.  Now dont get me wrong its not like complete anarchy over here. The thing is there are enough crimes happening that you are constantly hearing about one of them. Then if something happens to someone you know, you realize I doesnt take much for it to happen to you or your family. When you realize that most of these crimes the criminal had a weapon and used it, you start getting the mentality of if something ever happens, and if you have the opportunity to protect yourself, you need to at least level the playing field and hopefully you now have the upper hand. 

Here is the bad thing about fights now days. It used to be one on one. When one guy was down or quit the fght is over. Now if you get into a fight you better expect his 5 friends jumping in. Then they will brag about it. I don't get it. What is manly about 7 on 1? Yeah you bettwr win that fight if there is seven of you. There is nothing cool or manl about it. Ive even seen a guy lose a fight and it was over. Then after the guy just fought, lost, and is tired, a couple guys run up on him and kick the crap out of him more. They were too chicken shit to face him one on one another day. Whats even more sad is girls are getting to be like this. They arent being raised to be ladies. This country is deteriorating. The moral fabric is ripping at the seams.

I dont know what kind of music you listen to but if you want to see the difference in violence check out a rap video from England and then a gangster rap one from America. Listen to the words. Its crazy how different the lyrics are.

I was surprised, actually ... When Johnson (who was at RW) went down, I expected Yedlin to come in a RB, Cameron move up to CDM,  Bradley to move up to CAM, and Zusi to slide over to RW ... so at least Bradley and Zusi would be playing where they had been playing previously during the tournament.  Either that, or because we were in siege mode, maybe play 5 at the back with Yedlin at RB and Cameron at RCB.

Even if they were hard to get hold of consider how effective drug prohibition has been and imagine an increase in demand for an item you can buy in Prague for 300 euros is now worth 2K in the UK. someone will make some money from that. Finally think of the bad cop no doghnut posters who for the most part are both american and most likely liberal rather than criminal and read the sentiments they have for the police, if you are a ciminal you likely have less sypathy for the police and have had more contact with them, and been subject to more agressive behaviours from them, so as a criminal, how do you feel about the police carrying now?

I remember when we signed Sakho I was really excited too because we see new signings come into the front 6 more often with sometimes less, and sometime more impact.

I think a successful signing made in the back line that works out can really kick a team on. Sakho and Skrtel have looked pretty good; add in the quality and confidence of Lovren - I think that's really something to be excited about.

Suarez was no doubt a huge part of the fun and just mad football we were playing last season but we will continue to play that way - there's no doubt. What I'm eager to do is to watch our team do what champions do; control the game after breaking the other team down and knicking a few goals. 

Dejan is here to help tighten things up in back, our largest criticism last year.

Really looking forward to this season, after a challenging summer. I think top half will be just out of our reach, but I don't think we'll be in a relegation scrap. I'd say between 10th and 14th.  
  
**Which 3 players should other fans watch out for?**  
*James Ward-Prowse* - big season for him. Didn't quite push on as much as some were hoping last season. But he's incredibly talented, got a beautiful right foot on him.  
 
*Matt Targett* - Will fight with Bertrand for the left back spot, hopefully will get experience this season. Slightly different player to Luke Shaw, he'll look to whip the ball into the box early rather than use his physicality to get past people and to the byline like Luke. Great pre-season.   
*Dusan Tadic* - Big shoes to fill in Lallana's playmaker role. Scores and creates goals, looked great in our most recent pre-season game down the right with Clyne bombing on past him.  
    
*How do you think the team will line up?*  
I think we'll use 4-3-3. Eventually we'll move to a 3-5-2 but we don't have the players for it yet.

Forster and van Dijk are likely gone now.

Edinburgh:  History on a tortilla.. You can't throw a stone without hitting something 2-300 years  or older.  plenty of places to go for nice walks, I climbed up Arthur's seat.. probably lots of festivals, though there weren't any when I was there.  Definitely should have stayed here rather than Glasgow for my trip.

Stirling: There's the bridge, wallace monument, and castle.  The castle was great, probably second only to Edinburgh castle in Scotland.  Otherwise it's a quaint historical little town.

Oban: A pretty cool little seaside town.  Definitely worth a day trip.  They had some sort of street fair going on when I went

I know you're thick but...wow. Obviously you've formed your opinion of ITK and refuse to change it. I'm sure you completely refuse to listen to anything anyone described as 'ITK' says regardless of whether or not they have a good track record.

But then you go and post links to the Mirror, known for making up stories and pushing made-up links. Like the one you've linked above - how would this guy be the only one saying there's been a bid accepted? How would Darren from the Mirror (not much better than a rag) have good enough sources to break this story?

Of course you say he's a hard working journalist who spends time in club press conferences, etc. Well we all know how much bullshit you can spew even if you sit in on press conferences - look at the journalists AVB called out last year. 

I think you're incredibly naive for taking these links in the press at face value. They have a serious need to be first to post a story just so they can generate hits for their site. This is all journos, not just those in the Mail. They need to post first and if the story turns out to be true then they hit the jackpot but if not no one will remember a week later.

The vast majority of journos aren't much better than the vast majority of ITKs. And like journos, once you find a good, reliable ITK you know you can generally trust you're in a good position.

If your that fearful for your safety that you want to take a knife, perhaps you should call the police, or even let the damn phone go? 

By all means the father should defend him self after being stabbed in the face by the nutter, but stabbing someone repeatedly isn't really reasonable force in an attempt at self defence... Not that I can blame the father for not using reasonable force, being stabbed in the eye would probably sent me a bit crazy as well.

true,Theskian,null,null,"**1. How do you think this season will go?**

It will be interesting to say the least, there's no denying we lost some good players, but we've, in my opinion, replaced 1 with a better counter-part (Lambert/Pelle) and another has the potential to step up to fill Lallana's boots. Off the back of that, I've heard that Targett was going to get the nod ahead of Shaw, however managed to get injured. With all of this, and assuming we'll make a couple more smart signings now/in Janurary, I'd go for a solid 9-11th.

**2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for?**

Going to step aside from the likely 3 you'll see;

**S. Davis** - I think he was already a solid player, but I think this season he is gonna step up a gear, whether it be a more play making role, or having a few more go's on goal then he would, or setting some up/being in the right places, many of us think it's between him and Fonte for the captaincy. Very Strong presence. 

**Ramirez** - Towards the end of last season, he was showing real signs of what he can do and achieve at Southampton, I was incredibly impressed with his performance, on and off the ball, however injury was his shadow last season, and if he avoids it this season, he can really shine.

**McQueen** - The youth player I'm most keen on seeing more of, he looks incredibly hungry and bursting with talent, he has already netted us a few goals in pre-season, and while I think he will be a squad player, he can add to the depth we dearly missed.

**3. How do you think the team will line up?**

As for a lineup - http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=3ry5f *(As of 08/08/14, Turnbull is now on loan to Swindon Town)*. I'm aware I have put Davis in twice, because he rotates in that role often from what I've seen, that's the line-up I'd like to see and mostly expect, with the exception of Schneiderlin who I don't think will play immediately, and Rodriguez who won't be back til around Christmas. I've mostly kept the prospect of no new signings out of this, with the exception of Forster. My squad is primarily youngsters, that's because I rate them over the likes of Sharp/Mayuka etc...

Slight edit to my squad, I've been made aware Taider can play CAM too, so him as the cover there too.

Apologies if the inclusion of Forster seems presumptuous, but it would appear that after tonight, if reports are to be believed, he is likely to sign.

JJ offers a different perspective on most stories and doesn't pull the same shit most ITKs do. I've only been talking about JJ, as I hope you've figured out by now, and he's shown to be right enough times that I'm pretty confident in what he says. Of course there's still salt needed but the stuff he posts shows he's obviously in good standing with someone at the club. Like [this](http://spurscommunity.co.uk/index.php?threads/update-90-jj-on-griezmann.110710/) which was posted when all the papers where posting madly about Griezmann to Spurs rumors. I'm sure even you were in here posting Mirror and Telegraph links to the supposed bids we put in. I was pretty confident it wasn't going to happen after JJ's post, and lo-and-behold. Of course you'll say that's only one example etc but I've been loosely following ITK the last three years just for a different perspective and have found him to be the best.

Also, in reference to journalists breaking stories, you do realize that a story is only broke once, right? One newspaper breaks it and the rest pick it up and run with it. Sometimes that means bad info is picked up and circulated around.

This right here is the key. If you don't play them they'll never improve. If a player isn't brought into the first team by the time he's 21 it's pretty much over for him. If we want to get serious about developing youth we really need to start giving them chances. We have enough competitions that they can get some playtime in to be able to vet out who will come good in the first team and who won't. 

And don't get me started on the crazy feeling half of Spurs fans have that makes them say a player should be loaned out constantly to see if he's ready. How will loaning out a player every year until they're 23 mean they'll get first team minutes? In many other leagues in Europe they'll give youth chances in the first team from the time they're 18-19 - why can't we? I think Fredericks deserves the 2nd spot for RB to prove whether he's got the balls to play for us or not. And we don't need to go on purchasing 4-5 players every summer if we have talented youth we can develop in the first team. By buying our backup every summer and not promoting youth we're basically telling the youth talent we do have that they're not good enough, and they'll go elsewhere. What does that say for prospective academy players - that they'll never get a chance in the first team because we'll buy someone as backup instead?

I'm surprised (and happy) Bentaleb got a chance to prove himself, and I hope he makes it into the first team this year. The backlash against him in the second half of the season was ridiculous. Of course he'll make mistakes, he's 19 and just broke into the first team, but you need to support him and trust he'll come good. At 19 he's been superb and he'll only get better - we have a future starting CM on our hands and if he doesn't make it into the first team this year for one reason or another I can see him leaving next summer for a starting spot somewhere else.",0,1407361878,null,0,false,0,cjiwr69,t3_2ct3c3,t1_cjiwr69,t1_cjiwg7j,null,1435108034,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

There's been tons of games where it's bothered me we just didn't take the plunge - especially in Europa or the Carling Cup against lower opposition. Whats the worse that can happen if we played Winks, Edwards, Onomah, Oduwa, Lesniak - even from the start? Yes, they're young - they might not seem ready out on a training pitch or on loan at some League One club where they're on a completely different wavelength to everyone else. But I wish we took that plunge.

I mean, remember Danny Rose and his first Prem start? Remember what he did in that game, and the goal he scored against Arsenal? It was a solid performance to boot! It's not often that happens and we give a real prospect a shot. Bentaleb and Kane have looked promising, Townsend bounced around and only recently at 22/23 has got himself into a ''squad'' player role. I really hope we don't waste this batch - many players that go on to become first teamers or ''World Class'' are getting minutes at 17 18 years of age. 

Until they're out on the pitch, in the deep end, you just don't know. Look at Pogba and Utd and look at him now. He was doing what he does at Juve at Youth Level, but never got the chance. Onomah could be our Pogba, seriously if you watch this guy it's unbelievable how alike they are. Same build, same ''technique of a winger, strength of a DM'' who reminds me of a Dembele/Pogba style player. Martin Lipton tips him to be in the England First Team in 2018. Will we see him? Who knows. Same as Marcus Edwards - the praise he gets from *other* fans who pay close attention to their academies or the Eng u16/17's is unreal. Like ''he will be World Class'' unreal.

This is important: all adult residents are jointly liable for the tax, and you're legally obliged to inform the council that you live there.

Some people find it hard to get their head around the 25% discount, because you really need to look at it the other way around. A single person, living alone or with children, gets the discount. If full-time students are also present, the discount remains. It's when two or more non-student adults are living there that the full rate applies.

true,rjw57,null,null,"The Cambridge admissions system is one of the fairest I have ever seen. Each and every applicant is judged on their own merits with quite excruciating attention paid to individual circumstance. You will not believe the amount of data that the University will have on your school and the amount of data it uses to come to a decision. In addition, you can ask your school to complete an Extenuating Circumstances Form to accompany your application to allow the Admissions Tutor at your prospective college to take all the information into account.

The University has correlated performance in final year examination with all information that it has available to it including performance in A levels, GCSEs, social and school background, gender and a host of other factors. A summary can be found at [2]. The ECF forms part of this per-applicant context, as does any particular problems in your current or prior schools. The University maintain an extensive schools database to feed into this model.

To answer your specific question:

1) If you're really good at tests, yes. Otherwise, no. Colleges use entrance tests to help inform decisions but your performance in them is measured with reference to the level you're expected to attain given your background and experience, not in relation to others sitting the test.

2) Your choice of college does not affect your chance of being accepted by Cambridge. This is a feature Cambridge is rightly proud of. Consequently, applying to a popular college may lead to a greater chance of being pooled.

3) Ask your school whether they think it necessary to fill out an ECF and, if they think so, get them to do so.

&gt;

&gt;The __Carter Bar__ is the point at which the [A68](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A68_road) crosses the [England–Scotland border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo%E2%80%93Scottish_border) and forms a pass located at the top of [Redesdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redesdale) in the [Cheviot Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheviot_Hills) at an elevation of 418 metres (1,371 ft). The first sizeable Scottish town is [Jedburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedburgh) approximately 12 miles (19 km) north. Other nearby Scottish towns include [Hawick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawick) 16 miles (26 km) away and [Kelso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelso,_Scottish_Borders), 22 miles (35 km) away. On the English side, the first settlement is [Byrness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrness), followed by [Redesdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redesdale), with [Otterburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otterburn) next at the junction of the A68 and [A696](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A696_road) then [Newcastle upon Tyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne) 45 miles (72 km) away. The A696 and A68 combine to form one of the main routes (and a popular scenic tourist route) between Newcastle upon Tyne and the Scottish capital, [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh).

&gt;In 1575 Carter Bar was the scene of the [Raid of the Redeswire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_of_the_Redeswire), one of the last large-scale battles between the English and the Scots.

But if you're willing to take a bus instead of the train, then your range widens a bit.

Beeston, Lenton, and Chilwell are very student heavy, and they're still building in the new tram line, so traffic will be ridiculous until like summer of next year (and that's still debatable).

The city centre is fine if you don't mind the noise, and you should definitely find something tiny and easy to walk to work from for what you can afford.

Darlow and Lascelles are youth players, so no transfer fee.

Sale price: £6m (or whatever)

Bank accounts are notoriously difficult to set up in the UK as a newcomer because you need proof of address but you can't really have an address without a bank account. If you're studying though, banks will usually accept  a letter from your university as proof of address, so you should be fine opening an account at any bank. (If you have issues, Lloyd's Bank are known to be more relaxed with proof of address for Australians but I'm not sure if there's one in Newcastle.)

You can also choose to pay HSBC to open one for you from Australia so you can transfer money into it before you leave; NAB may also do this with their Clydesdale Bank association. I think you'll still need to prove your address on arrival though.

As for transferring money over, I haven't done so myself but apparently CurrencyFair have decent rates. You will need to set it up in Australia first to use it.

United received £20m from an investor in 1989(bare in mind £20m in 1989 is equivalent to well over £100m in football these days) and with that they funded the academy that brought through Giggs, Becks, Scholes, the Neville's etc. Most of which were already top prospects and signed from other academies btw. It also allowed them to break their then transfer record, three times.

All the teams got to where they got through investments at some point, it's all about sustaining it. Chelsea are the third most valuable club behind United and Arsenal, they make the second highest revenue behind United and have the second highest operating income(money you have to work with after all expenditures are dealt with) behind United, we have the second biggest fanbase behind United, we have the best training complex in the United Kingdom and we have the best crop of youth coming through right now. Chelsea put everything in place to be able to sustain this for decades to come without investment. We was one of the front runners pushing for FFP because we're currently in the second best position to operate under the FFP regulations and that could change if United fail to get Champions League again.

Chelsea no longer need investment to operate at the top, they just needed it to get there, like pretty much every other top team.

2. *James Ward-Prowse* others will no doubt mention him, but losing lallana and lambert means he is likely the one who will fit into the role of taking the free kicks as well as the corners he already takes, and we know he can hit the target from distance.

*Nathaniel Clyne* With the focus on the other England fullbacks exiting Southampton, I sort of feel like Clyne (to our benefit) isn't getting the recognition he deserves. He often beats his man on the wing, and he rarely gets beaten when he is defending his wing.

However, those tend to be higher level jobs rather than entry level ones, but I don't see why you'd move to a different country in order to work at checkouts. Really that's the whole point. Having don't need to have the entire EU market opened up to you. If you can just capitalised on a few language zones (like the German, French, Italian or Swedish ones) then it's already more beneficial to more people in the UK than some hypothetical union with the Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Canada, Australia and New Zealand are nice and everything, and I really think we should forge closer links with them (like the EU did with Canada just recently) and definitely freedom of movement.

One of the major problems, is that if anybody wants to capitalise on the benefits of freedom of movement or freedom of labour in the CANZUK, they need to travel literally thousands of miles which about as bad as the language barrier. If people actually learned languages whilst they were in school it would be worth it for everybody easily, but even for those that don't speak a European language (other than English) the jobs available to them in English, combined with the lack of distance, make the EU labour market more preferable than a CANZUK one.

* Manifest destiny and the westward expansion 

* The civil war and the antebellum reconstruction 

* The civil rights movement, covering Unions, Women, Asians, Native Americans, Hispanics etc. as well as African Americans. 

* The cold war and US global relations in the 20th c. up to the 1980s. We looked at the Cold War from the basis of  relations between Russian, the US and the UK and how that affected their respective Empires and spheres of influence.  

We covered basics like the drafting of the constitution and the ending of slavery as part of all of this.  

I think I did an unusual amount of US history, I've spoken to *Americans* who've studied some of this stuff in less depth than I had to! But there was plenty of text-books etc. with American history for British students, I know because I used them. So it's clearly not all that unusual to have the odd module on it.

we would be taking an absolutely enormous risk after damaging cruciate ligaments. It's the kind of injury that can go on to plague a career once it's happened. Not only physically, but that kind of injury can massively damage confidence. I'm not saying he isn't or can't be world class, but what I'm saying is that with £75million available, there are players we can get who are far less of a gamble.

also, you say some like Falcao wouldn't cost that much even on loan. If he came on loan (for argument's sake lets say he's on roughly the same wage he's at with Monaco - £250,000 p/w) that's replacing Suarez's wage immediately. £1,000,000 per month. £9,000,000 for the season. No guarantee that he'll stay fit. That's his wages alone, there'll be a signing on fee, as Monaco have said only the other day that he's indispensable, you'd have to imagine that loan fee would be another £10,000,000 at the very minimum. £19,000,000 (minimum) on a player who might not be even close to as strong as he was previously is a gamble. 

To sign him just because he's the only world class striker available right now would be stupid. It'd be a short-term solution to something we have the money to fix long term. ",1,1407373827,null,0,false,0,cjj2on7,t3_2ctnui,t1_cjj2on7,t1_cjj29i9,null,1435111125,-1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-1

She's an adult *woman* and quite capable of making her own decisions.  She knows her own mind, the risks, and her own heart.  

&gt;that is a 1 year old with a 100 year old.

It's not the same thing at all.  Your are comparing an infant and an invalid.  Clara and the Doctor are both adults in their respective primes.

&gt;If we think it's creepy to see aging rock stars with girls Clara's age, shouldn't we think it's creepy for the doctor to flirt with young humans?

The thing is, it isn't creepy.  People like to shame it because they are jealous or don't like the competition.  For women age can be extremely attractive.  Even women that say it is creepy will forget that for an older guy that they are attracted to.  When a woman chooses a younger man she is making a bet that the traits she sees in him *will* pay off.  When she chooses an older man she can see that they *have* paid off.  And in the Doctor's case, surviving 2000 years on the front line sends a very powerful signal that he has some of the best traits.  

It's also interesting that they have been showing the Doctor interacting with children more and more often of late.  He hasn't been coy about having had a family in his talks with Clara.

Despite the number of first team players we've lost this transfer window, we won't be in a relegation scrap. To match last years finish would be a dream, and highly unlikely.

**2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for?**

**James Ward-Prowse** - I like him a lot right now. Deadly right foot (see [exhibit 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRqIWBMAlgg) and [exhibit 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBSRPgaRGug)). One of many rising stars from the academy. Watch out for him becoming the heart of the team at central midfield

**Dusan Tadic** - A recent signing from FC Twente, he is the most likely to fill the role of Lallana out wide.  Good tactics and a technician on the ball. Can play out wide on either side of the pitch.

**Sam McQueen** - The academy churns out talent year after year, and he is another one from the academy. Came from the same class as Shaw and Chambers, and will be looking to make a name for himself. In order for the academy to be successful, its graduates need a chance at playing first team football, and McQueen looks primed for a breakthrough if Koeman gives him the chance.

http://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/2csc95/british_medical_students_stabbed_to_death_on/

According to the suspects the two Brits were having a drunken disagreement between themselves that was 'too loud' and were rude when the suspects asked them to tone it down, this apparently led to a 'slapping' of one of the suspects. 

No idea if that is true or not, but it is what the suspects are alleging. However the police report seems to indicate the suspects were not only intoxicated but on meth too - so not sure how reliable their testimony is.

The fact that they pursued the two victims by car in order to continue the altercation after the two Brits had left (or 'run' according to their testimony) and that there is an eyewitness to the actual stabbing means the case against the suspects looks pretty watertight and they will be subject to the death penalty if convicted.

I have lived in Malaysia as a British expat for 2 years and have had no issues myself - but then again I don't tend to be out in the local nightspots at 4am in the morning. If expats do start trouble with locals then they can expect a bad time - I know from other friends that some of the locals can be particularly sensitive if they think expats are making moves on their ladies and often these kind of incidents can escalate whereby pretty much all the locals will gang up on you unless you have local friends with you to calm the situation.

Personally I don't find Malaysia to be any more dangerous than the UK if you are being sensible. Just like at home there are certain places that you should avoid and certain behaviours that increase the risk. 99% of the time even being in the wrong place and doing the wrong thing does not lead to a tragic outcome like this - but sometimes sadly it does.

I have to say as fans we have been spoiled.  We signed a defender and everyone is worried about Falcao.  

I don't know if we will finish in the top four.  I sincerely hope so.  If not I am really pleased with the club.  They believe in the system and are trying to implement it.  Reina is about to leave, RB competition has been brought in. BR has invested in talent.  

(I concede here I'm sick and fucking tired of the Alberto Moreno saga)

We have talent in heaps.  No more Aquilani's, far are the Carroll's, unthinkable the Poulsen's.  

We have, potentially, a full season of ridiculous Sterling (who is getting a new contract).  Can looking a presence, Henderson looks sharp, Allen looks improved from last year.  Coutinho...sweet coutinho.  (who is getting a new contract).

CB: **Coates** + **Ilori** - last in line of our impressive-on-paper CB roster. Really gutted about Ilori not yet having donned the jersey even once. 

LB: **Robinson** - still got hopes for this kid (imagine young English duo Flanno + Robbo fighting for RB &amp; LB with young Spanish duo Manquillo and Moreno) but realistically only better than Smith right now who is yet to break into first team properly. Nope Chelsea game don't count.

CDM: Woulda said Coady, but I'd probably say **Can** - Realistically Lucas would be above him right now in the pecking order for the defensive role but we'll see what happens.

CM: **Allen** - playing the Hendo role. Behind Hendo/Can I think.

CAM: **Suso** - playing the Coutinho role. Would've said Teixeira but he's in the same category as Smith to me, only played a handful of minutes, not yet first-team established.

LW: **Borini** - behind Lallana/Coutinho/Sterling/Marko in the winger department. Probably ahead of Ibe but same as Teixeira/Smith.

ST: **Peterson** - I only say him cos I don't want to say Lambert. Currently it's between Sturridge and Lambert (Borini too but put him on the wing). Don't make me say Lambert.

RW: **Assaidi** - Forgot about him huh? He's still here.
