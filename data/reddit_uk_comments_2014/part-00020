There seems to be very little understanding of the effects of caffeine. There are hints that it might have an effect on brain development within teenagers. High doses have shown to increase jitteriness, anxiety and lack of attention. Others have shown that it enhances mental disorders like ADHD, etc.

Links between high sugar and high caffeine intake have suggested a compound effect, so while high sugar alone may not cause hyperactivity, a combination might.

I can fully believe that in your case that these drinks could be having an adverse effect on your son's behaviour, but I would also consider that they are not the sole cause.

I personally agree with the ban on energy drinks within schools, I also believe that they should have a age limit upon them.

I would suggest that if you want an informed view do some reading around on the subject, if you can get access to research journals that will help a lot.

Every companion in the reboot has complimented the Doctor PERFECTLY based on what he needed and when. The hate is just because of personal preferences or experiences faced by the audience themselves. Simple. 

Rose: Playing a 19 year old with perfection. 19 year olds don't have the emotional capabilities compared to someone as old as Donna or Martha. 
She was horrible with Mickey agreed but there have to be flaws in EVERY character so that they are believable. And she played that to the dot.

She was jealous (duh). 19, travelling through space and time with a good looking man who will do ANYTHING for her? Seriously guys. Any girl would be jealous if he was giving anyone else the attention he was giving her. She made her character.

Amy too was very young when she became the Doctor's companion and (even though I never really liked her before) don't forget, she did exhibit similar qualities with Rose knowing that she was the Doctor's favorite.

People conviniently forget that the time Rose spent with 9th/10th and Amy with 11th was WAY different. While Rose spent 2-3 years, Amy spent 10 odd years with the Doctor, got married, had a baby, baby turned out to be an adult who first wanted to kill the doctor and then fell in love with him.

There was so much going on with Amy and the Doctor. Just see the differences in their stories/arcs.

Martha (people like her the least and sympathise with the most) could have done without having feelings for the Doctor but RTD let her character develop into someone who is so much more than just a woman who didn't have her feelings returned. It didn't stop her from doing what she wanted to do in her life. She was strong and it showed perfectly in her role.

Donna's introduction was my least favorite (I had no idea who Tate was before she took up the role) and I found her loud, annoying to the core. But then she was so bloody brilliant as the Doctor's 'mate' (that still cracks me up). The fact she kept him in line and her ending was just horrible, compared to the rest of the companions IMHO.

Stop hatin'.

Too many draws have fucked us again this year. We won't get 4th because we refuse to kill off the smaller sides, particularly away.

Distin needs to be phased out for Alcaraz or Stones, preferably the later. He hasn't adapted to the new style at all like Jags has and constantly plays a long ball down the line like Moyes is still manager when other passes are on.

Martinez should see that game as Osman's Neville performance against Wigan. He should never start a game again barring absolute crippling injuries. He can still do a job for 20-25 at the end of a game but he's just too slow in all aspects.

Romelu is not the striker we need at all next year. We need someone who can bring the midfielders into play more and someone who has technical ability rather than a brute in the box. He finished the game yesterday with 46% pass completion. That's simply not good enough.

&gt;These people are, each &amp; every one is being made in a context that involves Jewish memorials, Business, Road names etc. To me, the people in these photos are clearly doing it to show anti semetism. Hiding their faces in many of the photos is also a giveaway to me, why would you do that if it is just a popular ""anti establishment"" gesture? I think you'd hide your face because you know it is a rascist gesture.

I never suggested, or at least, never meant to suggest, that anyone in these photos isn't doing it as an anti-semetic gesture, just that the gesture itself isn't anti-semetic.  Notice how you needed context to show the gesture was being used in an anti-semetic way.

A source who wishes to stay anonymous says that one Nigerian farmer, hoping for rain for his crops so he could feed his starving family, turned gay for one night, 9 months ago. This abuse of power angered God so much that God decided to drown the farmer ironically by first dropping ""just the right amount of rain"" and then switching to ""seriously too much rain guy.""

However, this still resulted in a bumper crop a few months later, bringing a great prosperity to his family and village, who otherwise would have starved, leading it to be widely deemed as ""totally worth it"". The practice spread like ""wildfire, but not quite the biblical kind"" and God finally said, ""Fsck [sic] it"", and simply drowned the whole continent.

You could try something very British and go to the football. Leicester City have a pretty good stadium and are doing well so should be an experience.

Birmingham, Nottingham, Leamington Spa and Lincoln are all relatively close and worth a look and if you are ok with going even further go to Oxford, Manchester or Leeds.

The whole Middle East political dilemma is just one big power struggle.

Meanwhile, the western powers and USSR/Russia, are hellbent on making sure they get their own share. And thus, they end up supporting vicious regimes, getting rid of said regimes, and other factions leap at the opportunity of said downfall. It's why people like Nasser, Gadaffi, the Assads, and the Husseins manage to stay in power for prolonged periods of time. 

What people have to realise is that there is no moral high ground to be had, because some faction or group has already flattened it. The saying ""In every revolutionary, there is a tyrant waiting to escape"" is appropriate in this context.

The controversy was the fact that clearly someone somewhere did see it and got pissed off, BUT the majority of West Bromwich as far as I am aware is not heavily Jewish, therefore they won't know/care what he did. 

This is the point... No one in the UK knew what it was, it's a French thing by some ""comedian"" who's apparently just racist. BUT he needs to be punished as given the fact we don't all know in the UK what that gesture meant, you don't want kids running around doing that as they celebrate (because we all know kids want to grow up to be Anelka)

THEN Zoopla, their sponsorship are saying they're pulling out as the co-owner is Jewish so obviously he's upset by the gesture. The funny thing about that is Zoopla wanted them to not play Anelka or sell him. (I am anti-racist as the next guy, but come on they have no right to tell a football club who to play and who not to play, even over something like this)

So yeah, Anelka is getting a slap on the wrist. WBA are losing their 3million pound sponsorship and this story is going to be in the papers for another 3-4 days until something happens in next weekends games and we all forget this ever happened.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;I can say from experience that drinking Fanta Fruit Twist turned my daughter's 'inane chatter' dial up to about 20. I could tell from the minute she got home if she'd had one or not by the speed and volume of her speech. Obviously that's a sample size of one so not exactly scientific but stopping her from drinking them did seem to stop her from talking the house down.

Which could be down to a conditioned response rather than a chemical one or something else to do with the drink or the environments in which she is most likely to have drunk it. You could also be confirming your bias if you are only asking if she'd drank this drink when you've noticed her being more chatty or simply that because you associate the drink with her being chatty banning it changes your perception and your less likely to assign ""chatty"" to the same behaviour as before. Control is just as important as sample size and that's why personal experience is no substitute for study.   

&gt;I notice the article is about the difference between sugar and artificially sweetened drinks. I'm not a bio-chemist but I'd be interested to know if the artificial sweeteners behave the same way as natural sugars.

It's a very different molecule that happens to trigger sweet tastes buds in the same way as sugar. It's also much more intense so you can use negligible amounts to get the same kind of taste for far less calories. So it's a question of what do you think sugar is doing to trigger hyperactivity and how would something that is a different molecule that provides next to no actual energy to the body be able to do to produce the same result.

**Butternut squash and chilli soup.**

Take a large squash, top and tail it, slice it in half lengthways, and scoop out the seeds. Put peppercorns, salt, garlic, cumin, a chopped chilli, and some oil into your mortar and pestle, give it a bit of a grind, then dollop that over the flesh of the squash. Roast at about 180C until the flesh is soft enough to be scooped out with a spoon. This can take up to an hour, and some parts will soften slower than others, so patience is key.

As the squash approaches the time you'll remove it from the oven, soften onions and a red pepper in a pan, before adding the softened squash, and add some stock (vegetable or chicken, your choice). Add another chilli (if you so desire), season to taste, then blend it in the pan. I add a little chilli powder at the end, just to give it a little more strength, but this isn't essential.

I use standard red chillis for this, but you can use stronger ones if you like. I attempted a scotch bonnet one time, and hugely regretted it.

Its like playing the potential lottery.  Who knows one them may become a hugely valuable asset for the club in the future.  If not, the initial outlay wasn't so great anyway.

The problem is that this policy disregards the team's immediate needs and also means we are never really in the hunt for proven talent.

We may put a big bid in for a player but, realistically, we will consistently be out manouvered in the transfer market games. 

Fair enough that we don't want to pay over the odds for a player but quality, experience and state of the market dictates the price of top first team players.

Thats why FSG are only after players with potential. Less risk and potentialy greater assets added to the club.

First we have to work out your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), this'll allow us to see what your RDA for calories should be. With weight loss you'll want to reduce this by about 600-1000 calories, if you reduce as such in a sensible manner you will lose weight, it'll be inescapable. I'd recommend planning your meals to ensure you get suitable energy throughout the day, swapping out whatever sets your caloric intake above the amount for a more viable alternative.

However, eating sensibly is only half the battle, I'd whole-hearted recommend you start on some sort of weight training programme ( a much better alternative to a pure cardio programme for weight loss). This will up your TDEE dramatically, allow you to eat a bit more freely and generally feel better whilst also losing weight. Now you mentioned you have back problems, this is actually quite a common complaint and many feel it prevents them from exercising. The key here is to work around your problem area and find lifts that don't put too much pressure or strain on your back, as well as ensuring any lifts that do involve the back and core are done with the strictest form.

Also, a counterpart host would also have to be dismissive, witty, and charismatic--in addition to being funny. That's a rare skill set.

Lastly, as others have said, there will certainly be a vibe of political correctness in a US version. I know you listed a bunch of politically incorrect shows as a counterpoint, but those shows are *expected* to be offensive. I highly doubt weekly guest celebrities on an American version would risk their reputation by being subversive on a single episode. Simply put, it just ""works"" on the British version. Just like ""Top Gear""

true,fidelcabro,,Yard of overproof rum.,"It depends on where you are drinking. I still get decent change from a fiver for a pint. And the political system does seem to work. Aged over 18 guess what you can vote so we are pretty free to decide who to vote for. As for the spying it is nothing people didn't already know that was happening. I am surprised that people are surprised that it goes on. There is no one sat around reading every single email or text or listening to every single phone call made. A computer looking/listening for certain words and phrases yes. And the people that the security services wanting looked at more then they will be looked at much closer.

It has been happening for decades, member of the Communist Party in the UK, file opened on you. Leader of a Trade Union getting lots of mail from the USSR, well the odd letter may be opened. Have a read of Spy Catcher. If you ignore the authors certainty that a certain person was a Soviet mole it is a good read as to what sort of stuff they do.

Protesting in this country gets nothing, a million protested against the war in Iraq, I was part of the student protests in London against the tuition fee raise. (I was against the cut in funding for education). And the problem at that protest was people getting into Millbank and destroying stuff and the number of protesters who thought tuition fees were the invention of the Tories. I explained to one Labour party supporting student that it was his party that brought in the fees, and then against what they said they would do brought in top up fees. He was adamant it was the Tories.

Then we have the looting in London a couple of years back, now that could have turned very ugly. What happens it rains a bit and people cant be bothered to try and cause mayhem.

We do have the ability to protest for our rights, but what rights have we lost? I cant think of any. And when people do protest the government doesn't pay any attention. There are things that you can do though, if your unhappy write to your MP, go see your MP when they have a surgery, inform them that they represent you and that you are unhappy with what is going on. They do tend to reply or speak to whoever is in charge of that department and reply to you.

Stay in Croydon if your longer term plan is to have kids and you want her parents support nearby. Staying there for football is selfless on your part, however, it's not making you happy, so consider that. I have family who travel from Bexleyheath to Selhurst Park (13 miles) and have been doing so for 30 years. If she loves her club that much, she'll make the effort.

In terms of affordability, I hear ya. Annerley, Penge and Croydon are unique in that most people on an average salary can still afford a two-up two-down there on a decent enough street. However, this has put you in a bit of a bubble. Nobody's to say that you'd have to take on a bigger mortgage but you may have to compromise and buy a smaller place, ex-local authority, doesn't have a garden, or somewhere that's a 20 minute walk from a tube/train stop. Don't limit yourself, life's too short. You think you've found the perfect little home but the truth is, you haven't. The old 'location location location' thing is known for a very good reason. Yeah, I live in a shoe box and I'm too long for my bed, but a ten minute walk up the road takes me to a street with 50 restaurants and 10 pubs and there are three pubs and probably eight to ten restaurants on my street.

In terms of ideas, look for: 

- Archery clubs
- Film clubs
- Cycling clubs
- Climbing clubs
- Scuba clubs

All of which exist, but just not in Croydon.

Go on guided walks of London (the small ones, ghost walks etc) and get talking to people.

Put an ad in your local Tesco that you're starting a cookery club. Or a once a month 'try a different curry house' club. Everyone loves curry, and I'm sure there are people in the same position locally.

Go to gigs and get talking to the people at the back who have gone alone.

Get involved in cultural stuff that happens at museums, opera houses, theatres etc, free (or cheap) talks/debates and the like. People love the sound of their own voices so I'm sure a bunch will go to the pub to continue debates.

Drive out to the countryside each Sunday and find a nice pub with locals in to get chatting to over lunch.

Get over your dislike of reviewing books and just do it; I have a few friends who run one and when they're not reading they're out partying and at dinner parties at each other's houses and going to festivals together. 

Ah, festivals: a great way to meet people. You don't have to go camping, there are plenty of day ticket festivals out there (Field Day immediately springs to mind, but you don't go there for the music, you go for the amazing pig roast and to talk to people in the real ale tent).

Forums are good for meeting people too; I've yet to see anyone other than Harry post 'anyone fancy a pint tomorrow?' in here. I'm not getting involved arranging meets because they fall on their arses but occasionally you may get a 'why not' reply from folk here for spur of the moment 'it's beer o'clock.'

The Women's Institute are quite active in London, and from articles I've read aren't full of middle-aged women anymore, and I believe men can also go along - or is there a male equivalent. 

Go along to plays run by amateur dramatic clubs; actors love talking about their thing and from what I've seen are pretty social.

Volunteer. Do a few hours in a charity shop on a Saturday morning, you'll meet loads of people. 

Get your Mrs to find out where the pub action is after the matches.

I was just about to post something similar.  I moved up here in 2006, but went off backpacking in 2008 thanks to redundancy.  I was away for 9 months.  When I landed in Heathrow and stayed at my mum's in Berkshire for a couple of weeks while sorting out a flat up here, I didn't really feel anything at all.

However, when the BMI Airbus banked over the Forth coming in for finals and I had the bridges out one window and Arthur's Seat, Castle etc out of the other one, it hit me like a brick.

Dieting doesn't but ones diet is the key to not being overweight.  It's easier to not eat two slices of bread than to burn it off.  Nearly all fat loss is down to diet.  Exercise gets you fit, helps burn a few more calories and helps you enjoy moving around.

But /r/fitness will tell you, fat is lost and gained mainly in the kitchen ( I'm a fucker for booze and when I was injured recently spent too much time eating and drinking, put on a lot of fat.)

&gt; So what is your suggestion for people like me? I'm already below the 2500 calorie per day intake.

Not everyone needs that base rate.

****
##Loans

**Suso at Almeria** -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.  
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

**Conor Coady at Sheffield United** -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

**Krisztián Adorján at Groningen** -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

**Pepe Reina at Napoli** -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

**Jack Robinson at Blackpool** -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil. **Update:** Paul Ince has today been sacked. Not really too surprising. Hopefully Robinson retains his place.

**Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City** -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

**Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC** -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when [Borini got his sliced goal](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/317665/iCFvMYz54FJyv.gif). Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.

**Andre Wisdom at Derby County** -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.

**Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley** -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

**Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley** -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [\[Individual highlights of McLaughlin here\]](http://t.co/iupeALveRq)

**Tiago Ilori at Granada** -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

##The academy:

**Liverpool U21s** -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.

**Liverpool U18s** -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.  
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.  
Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.  
Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [\[GIF of Wilson's second goal here\]](http://gfycat.com/WelloffSardonicAlaskanhusky)  
Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [\[Highlights of the 3-1 win here\]](http://vimeo.com/84277984#at=0)  

The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.  
Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save. Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.   
Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool.

I'm sorry but that is absolute bollocks. I know it's your opinion and you're by all means entitled to it but Demichelis is probably one of the most experienced defenders in the league. He's played in numerous leagues and was even in last years La Liga XI. If he can stop players like Messi and Ronaldo, it tells you a bit about how good he is. There are other things that Demichelis is inferior at. For example, he's quite slow with his feet and that could bite him in the ass at some point but it hasn't yet. Also, in the first few games he played for City he lacked the communication with his partner in defence. Also.. The lad doesn't stay on his feet. He's taken the wrong decision numerous times by choosing to slide tackle instead of staying on his feet and that's another quality that's not very good to have in the Prem. Overall, I'd take Demichelis any day of the week. Nastasic could blow up and become a very good player in the future but some people on here and some that I know IRL have overhyped him.

Get two pieces of bread(i wholemeal seeded), put a bit of ham and cheese in the middle, also if you have any nice tomato relish or something that goes well.

Then butter the top of the bread and stick it butter down into a hot pan. Whilst that is frying you can butter the other side, Then flip until both size brown.

Also baked potato's are extremely easy and lazy. Get a potato, brush some oil on it and a shit load of salt. Stick it in the oven. Takes 60-90 minutes to cook and it's almost impossible to overcook. Tuna, beans, cheese, even plane with butter.

Income: ~£250/week averaged over four weeks (ESA, Carer's, DLA)

Outgoings: 
Gas &amp; Electric £25 to £40 depending on how cold it gets.

Water £12

Telephone/Broadband/Mobile (no cable TV) £20 combined

Food for four people £60-£100 depending on what's left in the freezer

Petrol £15

'Bedroom Tax' rent top-up £15

Tobacco, papers, filters £17-£35

Loan repayment £10

No road fund license or insurance to pay as it's a motability car.

That's a total of £174 to £252, which pretty closely matches our actual weekly spends given the way benefits are paid out.  We usually end up with a few quid left at the end of the week, that gets thrown in the change jar which gets taken down the bank every few months.

Even amongst those who don't attend university, it's fairly common to stay with your parents until 25-27, especially if you're poorer than average.

Add a can of [chopped tomatoes](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=251202170 ) (34p seriously...). Add your choice of veg after. Usually I add some peppers/mushrooms. Grate some cheese in, season with salt/pepper. Sometimes I add a bit of tomato puree if it's around to boost the flavour a little.

 Now you've got yourself a relatively cheap, nice pasta sauce which will probably last 2-3 meals.

Nope and this is precisely what I'm saying is wrong. We are talking about the digestive system here. It's not a simple case of measuring what goes in and how much energy you expend. The body is not a simple box where you can say if you put 100 calories in you must burn 100 calories or you will gain weight. There are many variables which decide how much of those 100 calories your body digests as well as how much energy it has to expend to digest it.

I agree that losing weight is about eating less and doing more, I just don't agree with the simplistic nature of counting calories.

The Scottish standard grade (equivalent to GSCE) is currently split into three blocks:

1. Changing Life in Scotland and Britain (1750s - 1850s, 1830s-1930s and 1880s to date).

2. International Cooperation and Conflict (1890s–1920s, 1930s–1960s).

3. People and Power (USA 1850–1880, India 1917–1947, Russia 1914–1941 and Germany 1918–1939).

The pre SG curriculum (the first two years of secondary school) includes aspects of more distant Scottish history, some stuff about the Second WW and so forth.

This is why you fundamentally can't trust what anyone with a vested interest in Bitcoin says: they want people to buy in, so that demand rises above supply and the price goes up. They will not say bad things about Bitcoin, or if they have to admit to them (instability in value for instance) they'll explain them away by saying the problem will disappear with time, or it's a good thing because the price will only keep going up! They want other people to view it as a legitimate currency, giving it value, whilst they use it as an investment vehicle, so they can realise that increase in value. People who in turn buy into what they say, and buy Bitcoins, will then do exactly the same thing: attempt to pump up the price so they make a profit. Repeat until crash. It's not a currency, it's a vehicle for gambling (or investing, depending on your state of mind).  

Check out these [two](http://i.imgur.com/QsD0CbP.jpg) [graphs](http://i.imgur.com/vlWYotw.png).  

I got in quite early on Dogecoin (Takeoff on the graph above), and have a reasonable holding. A lot of people in that community are marketing it as 'for fun', not serious, encourage others to use it to tip others small amounts of money instead of upvotes, etc. The apparent prevailing attitude is that people don't care about the value. That is a lie. It's just in all the early adopter's best interests to get everybody else involved, lending it an air of legitimacy, whilst they sell their coins on the sly as the price increases. People didn't donate $30,000 to some Jamaicans with a sleigh out of the goodness of their own hearts, it was a marketing expense. This whole thing is an exercise in human greed.  

There are some people who believe in the libertarian principles behind Bitcoin, they undeniably exist, and Bitcoin does in some ways solve real problems. But they are vastly outnumbered by people out for a quick buck.  

**tl;dr**: Anyone who owns Bitcoins really wants the value to go up, and Bitcoins are worth what you can convince other people they're worth.",0,1390319941,null,0,1390321954,0,cev4328,t3_1vrctj,t1_cev4328,t1_cev3soi,null,1435524077,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

It's amazing how few people give a fuck about the colossal damage we have done to Iraq not just recently but over the past three decades. Over a million dead, more than 250,000 just from sanctions. Permanent ecological damage through the use of depleted uranium that has seen cancer rates and birth anomolies skyrocket. The destruction of vast amounts of Iraqi history. The deliberate destruction of infrastructure including water works and hospitals. 

And for what?

Even polygamy isn't banned in Islam, it is strongly discouraged (and this combined with cultural pressure means many won't practice it) but it isn't 'illegal' in the Islamic faith to have sex outside marriage. If I recall correctly the logic is that denying a man who lusts of sex may drive him to become unbalanced and commit greater sins. 

Divorce is also codified in the Qu'ran itself - there is a whole section on what to do in the event of divorce and whilst it is considered a last resort, it is perfectly acceptable. Once more though a key requirement is that the father support the children of these relationships.

In terms of the age of your wives, this is (I believe) purely a cultural thing, and not defined in scripture.

I'm not having a go, nor am I even a Muslim - I've just read the Qu'ran and want to correct you. You seem to be approaching this from a Christian point of view ... so your comment makes little sense!

Hello and welcome to my weekly loan and youth player round up.

Loans

Suso at Almeria -- As predicted, Suso had a major chance to impress in his favoured position of attacking midfield as Almeria met Racing in a home Copa del Rey second leg tie. Suso played 90 minutes in the game, of which Almeria unfortunately lost 2-0. A poor result, albeit against a better team, but Suso will be disappointed the not having made more of an impact. As of now, his best position looks out on the right wing where it is less likely he will doubled up on.
Despite having played a major part in the recent Copa games Suso is still unfavoured in terms of a starting La Liga place. Although, he is beginning to weed his way back into contention. This time with an appearance in Almeria's tough game away to a in-form Villarreal, Suso came on at half time with the score 1-0 to the home side but wasn't able to make a significant impact as they lost 2-0.

Conor Coady at Sheffield United -- Coady was disappointingly dropped to the bench for Sheffield United's home game vs Bradford, and was only able to make a very late substitute appearance. Although, it's disappointing to see Coady dropped, it proved an effective change as Sheffield drew 2-2 after two poor loses.

Krisztián Adorján at Groningen -- Adorjan and Groningen finally returned to action after their winter break as they drew 1-1 away to Waalwijk. Adorjan played a important role in attacking midfield, although he was sacrificed for defender Lorenzo Burnet when Groningen went down to 10 men. Leading at the time of this substitution, the man advantage helped 
Waalwijk as they grabbed a late equaliser.

Pepe Reina at Napoli -- Reina was absent again, through recovering from injury, as Napoli drew disappointingly with Bolonga due to a last minute equaliser. The game saw Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon give Napoli the lead after previously being 1-0 down. However, Ronlando Bianchi's literal last kick of the game goal, for then 10 men Bolonga, saw Napoli chance of the Scudetto slip further away.

Jack Robinson at Blackpool -- Robinson came up against Barnsley are their new addition in Ryan McLaughlin as Blackpool recorded their 4th consecutive loss. Again, there's little I can say about Blackpool. They show no sign of improving, and with questions of manager Paul Ince's future there could be further turmoil. Update: Paul Ince has today been sacked. Not really too surprising. Hopefully Robinson retains his place.

Oussama Assaidi at Stoke City -- Assaidi returned to Stoke's line up as they met bottom placed Crystal Palace. An easy fixture on paper, but Palace were determined and superb. With Assaidi coming off at the 70th minute, he wasn't able to perform to the level he was prior to a few weeks ago, and Stoke ultimately lost the game 1-0.

Fabio Borini at Sunderland AFC -- Borini was pivotal to Sunderland turning around a tough game to Southampton. The in-form southerners were 2-0 up when Borini got his sliced goal. Borini continued to play well and Sunderland bagged a equaliser in the second half. They even continued to push on and looked close to getting a winner, with Borini scoring another only for it to be ruled out for offside.
Andre Wisdom at Derby County -- Derby got back to winning ways with a tight 1-0 win against Brighton, Wisdom as always starting at right back. However, Wisdom was taken off prior to the goal in the close affair; being taken off for striker Conor Sammon, with Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford getting the winner.
Craig Roddan at Accrington Stanley -- Roddan wasn't part of Accrington's squad for their 2-1 win against Cheltenham.

Ryan Mclaughlin at Barnsley -- Ryan McLaughlin made his Barnsley début directly against fellow Liverpool counterpart Jack Robinson. The right back displayed a number of his skills, highlighting his pace, ability to beat a player and passing ability numerous times. In what is certainly a impressive start, it's good to see McLaughlin finally getting a great chance at senior football after failing to push through to the first team. [Individual highlights of McLaughlin here]

Tiago Ilori at Granada -- Ilori recently finalised a move to 11th placed La Liga side Granada. With comments from Rodgers coming to light, it is evident a loan move in January has been in the pipe line for a while. Again, it's great to see us utilising the loan system, especially using clubs in Spain; playing against the very best is a priceless learning experience.

The academy:
Liverpool U21s -- The U21s returned to attack after a prolonged winter break with a very tough match away to a strong Arsenal side consisting of the likes of Frimpong, Jenkinson and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Unfortunately, the game wasn't televised, so I haven't been able to see the goals but I do know Ngoo (2), Smith and Peterson were the scorers.
Liverpool U18s -- A U18 side, that was absent from such talents like Sinclair and Chirivella through injury, met Aston Villa at Langtree Park in the FA Youth cup 4th round. Due to this Sergi Canos was called upon to lead the line, with Ojo, Kent and Trickett-Smith behind. U21 pairing Brannagan and Rossiter sat deepest in midfield.
Liverpool started well, Trickett-Smith and Kent having early opportunities from outside the box. Liverpool made the breakthrough, from a similar chance, too in the 19th minute. Ojo's cross field run broke to Maguire, who pushed forward from left back. He chipped a ball back to Trickett-Smith who took and score a sublime half volley. Soon after, however, Villa were level. They pushed forward on the counter attack and a simple ball into the box caused more problems than it should have. With neither Williams or Randall able to clear, Villa's striker McKirdy poked it in. Villa were on the forefront now, with Ojo giving away a poor pass in his own half, Crump was the only thing stopping McKirdy from making it 2-1 to the away side.

Wilson replaced Ojo at half time, the Englishman not having the best half all around. Wilson was soon into action, winning a free kick 10 yards outside the area. Although, his attempt floated a yard or so over the bar. Villa were still in this, no doubt about it, and they emphasised that when Jordan Rossiter was forced to clear a header off the line. However, from that clearance Liverpool were able to counter, and it was Harry Wilson at the forefront of the counter attack. After a series of short passes Kent drove down the right and delivered Wilson with the ball. Although Canos and Trickett-Smith were open in the area, Wilson only had one thought in his mind. He cut onto his left foot and placed the ball into the bottom left corner. Liverpool regained the lead.

Liverpool finished the tie off superbly, with what was Ryan Kent's second assist and Harry Wilson's second goal of the game. Maguire pressurised down the left hand side forcing the ball the break the Ryan Kent. Kent did brilliantly to beat two men, and shake off a third. Next, he played a inch perfect through ball to find Wilson. From that point on, the rest was a given. Wilson left two Villa players on their arses and again slotted into the bottom left corner. [GIF of Wilson's second goal here]

Wilson almost finished off his hat trick when Kent, again, got it to him. However, his right footed shot was saved well. Final score, 3-1 Liverpool. [Highlights of the 3-1 win here]
The U18s were soon back in action, with a 5-0 win away to Blackburn. In a game where Neil Critchley made a surprising 9 changes, with only Sheyi Ojo and Sergi Canos retaining their starting places from mid-week.

Liverpool were off to a flyer when Wilson played a lovely one-two with Sergi Canos, although his shot was saved well. Liverpool continued to play well, and made the breakthrough in the 10th minute with Sergi Canos intercepting the ball, playing in Ojo who smashed the ball into the top left corner with his left foot. Blackburn responded well, earning a free kick which resulted in a shot Firth was forced to save. Ojo drove forward down the left hand side, continued to look like Liverpool's biggest threat and won a corner. It was from that resulting corner of which Liverpool went 2-0 up. Marsh delivered a curling corner and Cleary finished it with a well placed header. Soon after, Blackburn's Jack Doyle was fortunate to not be sent off for a potentially leg breaking tackle. Liverpool didn't let this deter them. Ojo, again, driving forward down the left delivered a great ball to Canos who placed the ball in to make it 3-0. Liverpool were in full stride now, with left back Sam Hart striding forward, he opened up play. Eventually, the ball came to Wilson on the left, and as he beat his made and drove into the box he was fouled and won a penalty. Wilson slotted his penalty in to again score. Half time and it was 4-0 to Liverpool.

Liverpool got their 5th before have time when Ojo was set clean through. He slotted past the 'keeper to further extend the lead. Blackburn looked more threatening, forcing Firth into making of impressive saves. Liverpool held on to their clean sheet to complete a superb performance. What was most impressive, was Ojo's performance. He bounced back extremely well after a poor spell midweek. Wilson continued to look much better than his age suggests, such an impressive talent. Canos seems to be settling in well, taking the chance of Sinclair's absence by the horns. Final score, 5-0 Liverpool. [Highlights of Liverpool U18s 5-0 win here]

This theoretically leaves you with about: ~£18480 (assuming both your ISAs need the full 5760 to fill them) in the Santander account.

At that salary you probably won't be able to get much mortgage, so you'd have to grow the savings more or buy a very cheap house.  But it's up to you at this point.  If you can get some money put away every month to build the pot then once your salary increases you might find housing more accessible.

I'm by no means writing off the chance of a mortgage, but at £15k I think you'd be pretty stretched financially if the boiler exploded or interest rates went up.

If you want to get into investments/long term savings then I would do a lot of reading on the Money Advice Service to learn all the terminology and get to grips with what different investments are before even thinking about it.

The article mentions this possibly having a negative effect on fertility rates....personally I'm not convinced. I suppose the real concern is that a lot of young people aren't doing well financially and so are staying at home out of necessity. I know it's become cool to want to break free of your parents ASAP but many people live with parents out of choice. Living on your own is really expensive and even for young people in work they're going to be at the start of their careers with low salaries. The expectation that a lot of these young people should be employed and be able to afford expensive solo living is weird (and personally I think reflects a strange sense of entitlement).

So I presume this statistic is being taken as a proxy measure of a lot of things (youth unemployment, the economic health of the country, the state of the property market). Frankly (for me) hearing a statistic like this provokes a very strong sense of indifference.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Chili is very easy and only a few ingredients.

Put mince (I do 500g and that gives 2 servings but I eat far too much for my own good) and a little oil in a large pan/saucepan or something that can hold a lot of stuff like a wok or something. Brown it a bit then add as much tinned tomatoes or pasata as you want. You can buy cartons of pasata in Sainsburys and I use one carton. Then add onions, mushrooms, kidney beans or anything you have around veg wise. Add some chili and/or garlic for taste and a little cumin. I add jalapeños on top. Then let it simmer on a low heat for as long as you can, an hour or so. I eat it with tortilla chips and cheese but you can wrap it in fajitas or eat it on it's own or whatever. Prep time is maybe 10 minutes and you can make a metric fuck ton and keep it in the fridge and so you don't have to cook when your tired you just need to heat something up. 

Also making fajitas or enchiladas with the Old El Paso boxes is about the best thing I can think of in terms of ease/taste ratio. It's pretty easy and really good. 

Stirfrys are also good. Chicken + veg + noodles in a pan + a sachet of stirfry sauce which most supermarkets have. It takes maybe 10 minutes to prepare and cook. If the vegetables need cooking it might be an idea to cook them a little in advance. Everything else cooks quite fast and the vegetables probably won't soften up in time. 

My friend has a recipe for baked salmon which is good. It's just salmon with tartar sauce on top sprinkled generously with breadcrumbs and baked until edible (can you tell I don't tend to bother following recipes to the letter?). As a side I sometimes fry little cubes of potato in oil until they go crispy or mash sweet potato and add a little paprika to spice it up.

After watching: Can you explain what your point is (I mean that politely, I'm wanting to learn)? I get that EA has [2.3M](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ea) shares trading at $24 and the Nintendo only has [150,000](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ntdoy) (although that number sounds ridiculously low?) trading at ~$16. EA is valued by the market to be worth considerably more and its earning per share are equal to Nintendo so clearly it must be making far more money. 

That to me is saying that in the unlikely circumstance that Nintendo was to go third party on PS4/XBO they would have (at least the opportunity for) far higher earnings per share meaning that each share in Nintendo would worth a lot more than EA?

E: OK another error, those were share volumes I mentioned not total shares, trying to look for those now. Found these http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ea/stock-report for EA but not for Nintendo...

I have a feeling many people see the name Gerrard and just assume he's going to be bombing around smashing the game day in, day out like when he was younger.  It's hard to watch a player like him age and his injury issues a couple of years ago certainly did him no favors.

I think he's still playing quite well most of the time but he hasn't quite figured out how to adjust to his body slowing down yet.  He's getting there and playing more carefully, but it takes time to change the way you play significantly like he's having to.  The people who think he's shit now are just insane, the guy is still tremendous.

I say this as a huge fan of Gerrard's, he's my favorite player to ever play the game and my footballing idol, but I think we played a little better without him when he was injured and I don't think he should be a nailed on starter when everyone is fit, but he still has an absolutely huge role to play for us and remains very important (as he will do until he retires).  To try and pass him off as rubbish is just outrageous, he may struggle at times with some physical/athletic aspects of the game now and he's having to adjust his game a bit to compensate, but he's still Steven fucking Gerrard.

I think the back 3 can work again, IF we have Enrique and Johnson. The system suits them. It might also allow us to play Agger and Sakho which is what we all want to see I think...

The issues then will be whether to play a more defensive central midfield of Allen/Gerrard/Hendo, or a more attacking one with Coutinho behind SAS. It could simply depend on who we face. Bit harsh on Sterling but we are in a tough fight for fourth and Everton and Spurs teams at the moment pick themselves while we are having to chop and change.

The main problem is we simply have to play SAS, and Rodgers thinks they both have to play upfront given that he has changed so many things in order for that to happen. It makes sense, they are incredibly creative and clinical. They make up for so much that we lack. 

I don't think we can play 4-4-2 with our players, Coutinho and Sterling lacking defensive presence in addition to our inability to defend crosses is suicide.

In that game played Berisha one half and must have been impressive in midfield for the Austrian big club. 

Liverpool should also have been on the stands when Berisha scored a goal and was player of the match then beat Salzburg Austria Wien 4-0 in a league match just before Christmas.

true,barejokez,null,null,"not an easy question.  a little while back i was working on a work project which required a good understanding of the new loans.  back in 2012 i worked out that if you had a starting salary of £30k and got annual salary increases of 5% throughout your life, (and RPI is 2.5%), you'd end up making payments totaling over £86k over the 25 years.  these numbers may be slightly out of date as i'm aware some of the thresholds have moved, but they haven't changed dramatically i don't think.

that's a lot more than the c. £45k you'd be borrowing in the first place, clearly.  but it is more complicated than that, as money invested can grow.  put simply, if you think you can earn 5% return on the money over the life, you'd be very close to matching the loan repayments. that's what my quick calculations tell me anyway, please check for yourself, don't rely on an internet stranger's advice!

however, if i can make some educated guesses, i will suggest that your guess of a salary of £25k (with annual rises of 4-5% or so) is probably pessimistic.  if your parents can afford school fees and to give you this no-loan option, they are probably earning quite a lot of money (or have wealth), very likely more than your assumptions, and it seems fair to assume that you could end up doing the same.

if you do end up relatively well-paid (and i'm aware that you don't have to be a millionaire to provide your child's education privately), you will quickly get to a stage where taking the loan would be the less economic option. but you won't know that for sure until you it happens.  speak to your parents or someone about what your career trajectory might look like.",0,1390324601,null,0,false,0,cev64wi,t3_1vr8zx,t1_cev64wi,t3_1vr8zx,null,1432040012,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

Is it sad that my first instinct here is to feel like we're being trolled? Day old account, somewhat silly name. I'm so cynical : (

If you're being serious, I apologize. I will warn you that there's not much you can say in terms of history that won't make you look a bit ridiculous to an Arsenal fan.

Our club has great history, but in terms of silverware we don't really hold a candle to them--especially recently--and you will be reminded of that if you try to gloat about anything. 

We can be proud of stuff that our club accomplished before anyone on this subreddit was even alive, but I suspect there isn't an Arsenal fan on this site who cares that we were the first to do the FA Cup / League double or the first English team to win a European trophy. In fact, I suspect the vast majority of them don't even know that. 

There is more to history and a lot more to football than winning trophies, as both recent Arsenal and Tottenham fans will tell you, but make no mistake you've chosen the historical underdog of the rivalry. 

If you want to make fun of Arsenal talk about their notoriously fickle supporters who have gone from literally crying outside the Emirates after one result to smugly claiming they had faith all along. They are the definition of a spoiled fanbase. Shocking how so few of them realize how good they have it.

true,Lilday,cnty-england,Liverpool,"&gt; Rent is always more expensive than mortgaging. That's by design - the landlord will want to turn a profit. That's all landlords want to do. You'll have to make do with what the landlord dictates about the property. Facilities, even what colour the walls are, will not be your choice.

If I agree to rent a place it will be one I choose. Nobody is holding a knife to my throat. If I want to paint the walls and the landlord says no, I'll look elsewhere. I won't rent somewhere if it isn't to my taste.

&gt; You also get a large chunk of your mortgage payments back when you sell. This is what they mean by property ladder. Buy small, pay mortgage for a few years, now the equity of the property is worth more than you first had to stump up for that place. Buy bigger place. Retirement brings freedom to sell and move away from cities, should you choose to do so.

That is assuming I'd want a 'bigger place'. If I move in somewhere it is because I'm happy with it...not because I want to use it to turn a profit and move somewhere else.

&gt; You don't get rent back. It's gone.

Yeah but I can't take a house with me when I die either.

Maybe I'm young and naive, but I don't understand the whole thing. If I don't have £200,000 in cash, I won't go looking for a £200,000 house and spend 20 years paying for it. I'll live with what meets my requirements and my resources.

I feel like these days I'm surrounded by people who own what they can't afford.

They can't afford a £500 phone so they pay £30 a month for 24 months and end up paying £720 for it (in which time it has depreciated to £100 or less). Or they buy a £5,000 car for £200 a month for 36 months so end up paying £7,200 for it (in which case it has depreciated again).

People seem too happy to jump into contracts and pay more than something is worth just to have it, when actually they end up paying more money for it and resenting it. I can't imagine how much I'd hate a house if I'd been paying for it every single month for 20 years. That is depressing.

&gt;**The Slender Man** (also known as **Slenderman**) is a fictional character that originated as an Internet meme created by Something Awful forums user Victor Surge in 2009. It is depicted as resembling a thin, unnaturally tall man with a blank and usually featureless face, and wearing a black suit. The Slender Man is commonly said to stalk, abduct, or traumatize people, particularly children. The Slender Man is not tied to any particular story, but appears in many disparate works of fiction, mostly composed online.

true,notsurewhatdayitis,eng-yorkshire,East Yorkshire,"&gt; Income: ~£250/week averaged over four weeks (ESA, Carer's, DLA)

How does that work out with assuming 2 children? 

Child benefit £33, Child tax Credit £115, ESA should be around £200 with the carer premium, even more if you qualify for severe disability premium, Carers allowance £58 plus whatever the care component of DLA you have.
I think that if £250 a week is truly your total income if you've kids as well that you may be missing out on some benefits. Might be worth speaking to CAB.

&gt; Tobacco, papers, filters £17-£35

So between £884 and £1820 on smoking. How much was the loan for? Bet it was less than you spend on fags a year. 

I think there may be some savings to be had on the mobile/broadband/telephone. £80 is rather a chunk to be paying even if all four people have a mobile. www.billmonitor.com is a good comparison site for mobiles.

In a frying pan chuck in either chopped bacon, or pancetta chunks that you can buy ready-cut. Stir them occasionally on medium until they're letting their fat go. Chuck in a clove of garlic (not cut, skin on).

Meanwhile break one egg per person into a bowl, whisk them and stir in a shitload of grated parmesan.

When the pasta is ready, strain it immediately and return it to the saucepan (off the heat!). Ignore the garlic, scoop out the bacon bits. Throw them into the pasta. Pour the egg/parmesan over the top and stir until it's completely mixed through. That's it.

Yeah that's something I don't agree with either. I'm in the catch 22 of knowing that increasing the strength of my lower back muscles would help but that doing the requisite exercises means I usually can't walk for a few days.

&gt; Unfortunately as I don't know the severity of your injury I can't give you specifics, but if you're not at disability allowance level or some such, I'm sure we can work something out.

Two shot discs in lower back which resulted in major spinal surgery and then 13 years ago the disc above those failed and its inoperable. If I go to the store 300 yards away and buy a 2L bottle of milk which weighs about 5lb, carrying it back home results in severe stabbing pains in both legs and buttocks and me hobbling back home, usually having to stop a couple of times. In the UK and have been awarded disability for life. Not sure how that compares to the US as I have no knowledge of how they award it. 

I'd be appreciative of any suggestions because as I said, I know that if I could get some strength in my lower back muscles to help support the upper body weight it'd take some of the pressure off my spine and reduce the pain.

true,agentdcf,flair8,,"My own answers to the questions:

1. I think ""success"" for us will be revealed in both a close score and the underlying stats. I want to see us belong on the pitch with them. They are a better team--let's be realistic--but I think if we can avoid getting badly out-chanced or run over, then I'll be happy with it. I don't want to see us blown out on the scoreboard, but nor is it a very encouraging sign if we only lost 1-2 but get out-chanced 1-10.

2. This may be very unpopular, but I've had this wild thought lately of playing a sweeper against City. Yes, obviously Lloris is a sweeper-keeper, but City just lights teams up. What if we did Chiriches as the sweeper, Walker, Vertonghen, Dawson, and Rose as the back four, Sandro and Dembele in the midfield, with Lennon and Eriksen on the wings and Adebayor up front. I'd park the bus. Tell the team to sit deep and soak up pressure, and then attack on the counter--Eriksen could drift inside to help in midfield, while also providing a link to Lennon and Adebayor to try to hit them on the counter. It's probably a ridiculous idea, but hey, what are message boards for if not for ridiculous ideas. If I played football manager or something, I'd totally try this. 

3. I think Sherwood will go with a formation similar to what we saw against Swansea. I hope he brings Sandro in as defensive midfielder in place of Bentaleb, but otherwise I bet it's roughly the same idea.

4. I think we'll lose 1-3--a result that just just not-bad enough that it'll be okay to argue that it's a semi-acceptable result (""we didn't get killed!""), but not anywhere near good enough to be really happy about.",1,1390329490,null,0,false,0,cev8h9m,t3_1vs2o5,t1_cev8h9m,t3_1vs2o5,null,1432041306,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

Drogba probably wouldn't have enough to play a full 90 minutes (we will find out what he has left in a few weeks) but could be very dangerous as a sub after 70 minutes.

Personally, I like to have different types of players at the striker position. A Giuseppe Rossi type player might work incredibly well with our talented midfield and would be a huge change of pace from Lukaku. If not Rossi, some other technically gifted, quick striker. 

I'm very high on Lukaku. I think within a few years, he will be the best striker in England. However, he will unlikely be dominant next year. We should build around Lukaku for the future, and look at another temporary option for next season. Drogba is nice, but he wouldn't be able to handle a lot of minutes if Lukaku got hurt. Maybe Zlatan would be interested in making a run at a title in England. He has won everywhere else, the appeal of dominating another country might lure him to the Bridge.

Yes, there is personal responsibility, and no this won't promote drinking and driving. But it enables people to do so.

At some point, somebody is going to have one too many, and that someone is going to have a lapse of judgement at the wheel of their vehicle and it may cost somebody their life.

This is a really stupid decision to open up this pub on the part of all parties involved (Not just Wetherspoons).

He's cool and collected and can be a part of the build-up. I get the feeling that Nastasic is more of a no-nonsense kind of defender. He does a great job in defence but he is nowhere near as good as Demichelis on the ball. Things like that develop with time, especially when you've been brought up in an Italian system of play where the defender only needs to work on the defensive part of the game.

You could probably get something for 75k, put down a 15k deposit and take out a 60k mortgage over 20 years.  According to [this calculator](http://www.bbc.co.uk/homes/property/mortgagecalculator.shtml) you'll be paying around £400 per month at 5% (but be prepared to be paying closer to £600 per month when the interest rate is around 10%, and it may go higher still). 

Rightmove suggests the going rent in Shrooby-Doo is around £400pcm for a 1-bed apt, or £600 ish for a 2-bed.  So I guess you're already paying something in the £400-600 range.

Obviously you need to get proper financial advise, but at first glance it looks like a possibility.

---

&gt;

&gt;The **quenelle** (French pronunciation: ​[kə.nɛl]) is a gesture which is performed by pointing one arm diagonally downwards palm down, while touching the shoulder with the opposite hand.

&gt;French political activist and comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala is credited with creating and popularizing the gesture, which he first used in 2005 in his sketch entitled **1905** about French secularism and has been used since in a wide variety of contexts.

Gerrard/Henderson/Sterling can cause a lot of action building from the right. Personally prefer Gerrard and Henderson playing offensively in the center of the pitch. Think Flanno could perform well as a LWB or RWB. This of course accomodates the best positioning for Sturridge/Suarez. Coutinho omitted for his drop in form.

Two things about your comment clash in my mind:

* You say that anyone holding Bitcoin would be pedalling it (~~possibly~~ ^edit definitely ^/e to a disproportionate and hyped way) because they want the value to go up (I agree with this), but...

* Anyone who genuinely thinks and feels that Bitcoin (or successor) will change the world of finance (^edit4 for the better) *would naturally be holding Bitcoin because they think that*... Otherwise, they wouldn't be holding it.

true,TKSFGK,null,null,"r/fitness will have a load of resources that'll cover everything in more detail. Given what you've said regarding milk and walking, most people will find that carrying something proportionally heavy for an extended amount of time quite draining. Thankfully though lifting weights is all about short bursts of exertion and rest in between, which I personally find to be less exerting than other forms of exercise.

I'll treat your back as a no-go for the time being in terms of serious lifting, don't want to advise anything that might cause further harm. That said there's still hell of a lot you can work to put on a little mass and therefore up your potential calorie count per day. Personally, if I was in your situation I'd get myself a bench, barbell and dumbbells/gym membership, and build myself a solid routine with of exercises that'll avoid anything involving flexion of the spine (for the time being at least). Most flat bench chest and tricep exercises will avoid putting too much pulling pressure on the small of your back as weight will be distributed over a large surface area (eg, Bench press, incline bench press, close grip bench press, flyes, skullcrushers). You can also lay prone on the bench and do a few rear shoulder/back exercises, allowing the bench to take the strain that'd normally be placed on your lower back/core if your doing the same exercise standing (eg, bent over rows, lying rows, wide grip rows). 

If you match this up with a balanced diet you should find things a bit more manageable.

I find this site to be a great resource for planning any sort of routine, it'll tell you how you can work each specific muscle group with the equipment you have available : - http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html
Also, I'd recommend 5x5 strength training or at least a variation of it to get you going sets/reps wise.

He ran as an Ulster Independence Movement candidate in the 1996 Forum Elections and the 1998 Assembly elections, and as an independent in the 2003 Assembly elections and a council by-election.

The combined Unionist vote in 2005 in the area had been 2,446.
In the 2010 UK general election Frazer contested the Newry and Armagh Parliamentary constituency as an independent candidate. He received 656 votes (1.5%). The seat was retained by Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy who received 18,857 votes.[31]

If United really are prepared to spend this kind of money on an attacking midfielder, does anyone really believe they won't be able to find another player of Mata's quality? For £45m?  Easily. 

OTOH, Mata isn't worth £45m to us presently. So, United is desperate to overpay for a player, we have a player we are not using, shouldn't we take advantage?  When someone is desperate, don't you want to be the guy sitting across the table from them?

And I'm not even convinced Mata will make them that much better. He can only play in one position in their system, as a number 10, which pushes Rooney out of that position. 

I can definitely see what the logic behind this is from our side. 

The only thing that doesn't make sense is the timing. As /u/kyhadley posted elsewhere, if makes a ton more sense to do it in the summer so it counts against next years balance sheet. But we may be worried that we won't see an offer this big in the summer.

Is the reason that the garage is so sure it's the plugs is because they've read the fault codes and it's stating a misfire? If so, it's a bit odd that they have discounted any other parts of the ignition system...

Chiriches has adapted quite well to the PL pace. Given that he was playing in the Romanian league, this is as equally impressive as Eriksen. His reading of the game has been improving as well, not solely relying on his speed and ability on the ball. 

Walker has matured into a great fullback. Doesn't need to use his amazing pace all the time. Offers a lot going forward and tracking back to defend. 

Lastly, our captain Daws has been doing great in Jan's absence. It's such a shame that he is as old as he is.

true,lomoeffect,null,null,"&gt; And I'm not even convinced Mata will make them that much better. He can only play in one position in their system, as a number 10, which pushes Rooney out of that position.

Precisely this. I posted this somewhere else but Manchester United need wingers and a decent CM, not a number 10 which can already be fulfilled by Kagawa and Rooney. There's an argument that Mata can play on the wing, which is correct because he won the BPL player of the month award in that position under AVB, but with the philosophy that United play, he simply doesn't have the pace.

""Pursuing a solo career on stage, his one man shows have been noted for their degeneration into antisemitic vitriol, leading to intense controversy and a string of prosecutions and fines for Dieudonné. Perhaps his most infamous antisemitic provocation came in 2008 when veteran French Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson (q.v.) was given a “heroism” award presented by one of Dieudonné’s assistant’s assistants dressed as a concentration camp inmate replete with yellow star. Faurrison and Dieudonné subsequently appeared together in a video mocking the Holocaust, the commemoration of which Dieudonné denounces as “memorial pornography”.

Dieudonné also allowed the theatre he owns in Paris’ eleventh arrondissement to be used by both FN activists and the now defunct Tribu Ka, an antisemitic Black Nationalist group, whose members marched through a Jewish neighbourhood in Paris in 2006 chanting death to the Jews. The group was subsequently banned and its leader, Stellio Capo Chichi, imprisoned. Capo Chichi acquired further notoriety during the trial of the antisemitic killers of Ilan Halimi, a young French Jew who was kidnapped and tortured to death, when he sent threatening e-mails to a range of Jewish organisations.

true,inlock,lfc68,,"You're right. I'm using Coutinho merely as placeholder for an attacking midfielder, that could score. We currently don't have such a player. I know buying a developed attacking midfielder is lower on our priority list, but I feel we need to buy one as soon as possible.

Who do we currently have in the attacking midfield position? The pecking order of the number 10's is currently this:

1.  Philippe Coutinho
2.  Luis Alberto
3.  Steven Gerrard

That's it. Gerrard cannot be a number ten for more than thirty minutes, before he starts to tire. I haven't seen Alberto play for months, and I doubt Rodgers trusts him to be in the line-up for the full ninety.

Yeah... our only option is Coutinho in the number 10 role.

What other options do we have? Well, we can play Suarez as a false nine. He will have to create space and chances, and there's no doubt he can do that. The line-up will have to look as followed:

            Sturridge
    --------  Suarez  Sterling
        Henderson  Gerrard
    Flanagan          Johnson
          Sakho  Skrtel

We need someone on the left wing for that. And you'll have to make a choice between Moses and Coutinho to play there? Who would you choose? (This is a rhetorical question, of course.)

Do we have a formation where we can avoid Coutinho? Let's first look at the possible starters in midfield and attack: Alberto, Gerrard, Henderson, Allen, Moses, Sterling, Suarez, Aspas, Sturridge.

We can already strike through some of these names, as they won't start. We end up with this: Gerrard, Henderson, Allen, Sterling, Suarez, Sturridge.

If we drop Coutinho, we __must__ start with Gerrard, Henderson, and Allen in midfield.

The formation will look like this:

    Suarez  Sturridge  Sterling

       Henderson  Gerrard
              Allen

    Flanagan          Johnson
           Sakho  Skrtel

Allen as DM, Henderson as CM, Gerrard as CM with licence to move forward. Henderson and Gerrard can swap roles. The midfield is really shaky. It can't defend well, it can't defend well. There's no real number 10 to connect the midfield with the attack.

So, yeah, Coutinho is kind of inevitable. Let's just hope he finds form quickly.",0,1390342284,null,0,false,0,cevevp2,t3_1vrs9r,t1_cevevp2,t1_ceva41u,null,1432044354,-1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-1

The moment you think it is not is the moment your expectations are too low.  I don't care if we are playing Bayern or Barca or some other lower team the loss feels the same. We are one of the best in the world. 

You really think Man City can spend more than us? The difference is we don't need to spend as much because our team has spent plenty to build the young team we have. They are in the stage we were in 10 years ago. We don't need to pay outrageous fees for players. We have them and they are young. We could add a few here and there but we don't need them.

Meanwhile cook the pasta and grate over some parmesan. Takes 10 minutes mostly cooking the pasta. 

* Pasta with pesto, halloumi cheese + pine nuts. Toast pine nuts in pan. Slice halloumi and fry in pan - tastes a lot like bacon. Meanwhile cook the pasta... then mix pasta, pine nuts, halloumi slices, and half a jar of red pesto. Again takes 10 minutes mostly cooking the pasta. 

* Pasta Nicoise. Slice an onion and caramelise in pan. Add salt, garlic, dried herbs to taste. Add a can of tomatoes. Cook till this reduces a bit. Add a tin of tuna. Meanwhile cook the pasta... takes about 20 minutes and is encroaching into actual cooking territory, but not very far.

Edit: Some points in the article worth noting that aren't really getting a lot of traction in subreddit discussion surrounding this.

* Mourinho would still be given the final say as to whether Mata should be released.

* The Portuguese could yet block any move, though his stance is likely to be shaped by **Mata's attitude**

Mata's attitude is an important point. He's still got love for the club and our players, read his blog on weekends.  Minutes on the pitch aside he hasn't been a bitch about this, it sounds like he's taking it in stride for the most part.

* [Mata] would not naturally agitate for a transfer but, if he makes clear his desire to move in talks with the management, the club are expected to yield.

Again, it seems like management wants Mata to make the move even if United make a bid.

* Wayne Rooney, a player Chelsea have coveted since last summer, will not move to Stamford Bridge as part of any prospective deal for Mata. 

So cash only, and we lose some cover in the midfield because of moving Mata out. It seems like the club would either want Cash + Rooney, or force United to break the bank. That is if Mourinho says okay, and Mata makes it clear he wants to leave.

And again...

* Mourinho would still be given the final say as to whether Mata should be released.

People on here are lamenting as if we've already lost him, people on the MUFC subreddit are talking about this like Mata's already in a red tracksuit. In the event he does leave, we're going to make a shit ton of money and make Moyes put Juan Mata on the Glazer's charge card or (on an off chance) bring in another striker with some money as well.

Manchester United, despite their heavily publicised debt, remain one of the few profitable clubs in the world. Add to that the revenues from a Rooney transfer, which looks inevitable over the summer, and they are one of the few clubs in the world that can afford a transfer like this.

**TL;DR:**

* [Alcohol](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/#Alcohol%20and%20Tobacco) blocking fails due to the campaigns being targeted at https enabled social media platforms
* [Blocking filesharing](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/#File%20Sharing) blocks all file hosting sites including sourceforge - but not actual P2P filesharing of course
* [Gambling](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/#Gambling) is blocked. Except on Sky which has a gambling division and doesn't even offer the option to block it.
* [Games](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/#Games) blocking fails to block https-enabled social media sites. Manages to block app stores and critical application patching however. Insecurity FTW!
* [Sky blocks bulling](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/17/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1/#Cyberbullying) via magic fairy dust not available to competing ISPs
* Despite much fanfare, [Pro-ana content](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/#Pro-Ana%20Content) not blocked at all. Government actually realising complexities here? Surprising result
* [Sex-ed](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/#Sex%20Education) block works, knocks out LGBT content, still fails
* [Web-blocking circumvention](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/#Web%20Blocking%20Circumvention) turned on by stealth on BT once base level of filtering enabled. Makes incredibly half-arsed attempt to block VPN sites
* [Esoteric material](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/#Esoteric%20Material) block attempt by government to block cult websites without actually introducing legalisation to define cults. Like pro-ana content blocking, not actually implemented
* [Extremism and Terrorism](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2014/jan/18/inside-default-web-blocking-part-2/#Extremist%20Terrorist%20Material) not yet blocked as that is a separate programme to expend the scope of CTIRU to roll out existing block list not yet implemented

It's a mess of a system, most of which outright fail to work and where it partially works often raises further issues. Analysis illustrates the duplicity of government advocates.

First, you need to go to you hairdresser, get them to thin out your hair, yours at the moment is quite thick and... Staticky? I don't know the right term but basically one thing you'll notice about MS is that he never has a hair out of place, that's in part due to hair styling, in part due to having the right hair thickness.

Just show the hairdresser a picture of how you want it and let them work their magic.

Second, after a morning shower you want to dry your hair off then gel it using standard gel, nothing that'll crisp up and make it look horrible, when it's approximately what you want dry your hair using the cold setting (this helps set the style). Once you've done this you need to use a clay type hair product (Although I don't go for the MS look I've found the Tigi Bed Head matte seperation workable wax [See here](http://www.amazon.co.uk/TIGI-Head-Matte-Separation-Workable/dp/B001SKHJBE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390344618&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=tigi+bed+head+matte+separation+workable+wax) works well on thicker hair), apply this as necessary to shape your hair to the style you want. 

Also, word to the wise, for the hairdresser step if you want to go full out try and get screen caps of MS from each angle (Front, left, right, behind, ideally from the same episode) this will not only ensure that you get exactly what you want but it'll make your hairdressers job a lot easier.

Milner and Navas are ahead of him, but we have a lot of fixtures between now and Nasri coming back. Do you really want Silva playing against Watford? Do you want him playing Villa 4 days before Barca away?

I think Lopes deserves the Watford game, and at least 1 start vs Stoke, Villa or Sunderland (all at home).

Also our formation has stayed the same for a long time now, we've only changed it a couple of times all season, Lopes isn't competing with any of the strikers.I like to think of his performance from this perspective - he picked up MOTM ahead of Aguero and Negredo, 2 assists against a PL team. 

Fact is we are scoring a lot of goals and have quite a few home fixtures coming up against weak sides in the next month. Why not start him and bring on senior players if we are struggling, or bring him on when we are 2 goals up for 30mins or a second half. Now is a great time to blood him in and he's only going to get better with experience.

i find once you get decent at cooking meat so that it actually tastes nice on its own is a good way to feed yourself, so many people seem to overcook things so that it loses all taste and just end out simmering it in some sauce, adds a lot of calories and just no need imho, herbs and spices are more my thing there.

true,sickgrof,num10-away,,"1) Anything other than a loss is success. Some people might say only losing by a goal would be success due to our past run-ins with top clubs this season, but a club with legitimate CL aspirations should never view a loss as a success, no matter the situation.

2) Has to be a 4-2-3-1, IMO. If we play with a two man central midfield against City, we're going to get demolished. The midfield trio, for me, has to be Sandro, Dembele, and Eriksen. Sandro will be incredibly crucial in this match, if he can play. We need lots of pressure in the midfield. I would have Townsend and Azza on the wings. Kolarov might be a lot of things, but fast is not one of them. Azza can abuse him if we play it right. Townsend is great on the counter, which we'll probably play off of, even at home, and is great at relieving pressure by dribbling out of danger. I think him playing on the left, with the form that Ade is in up top, will lead to some real chances in the box.

3) I honestly don't have enough of a read on Sherwood yet to have an idea of what he might do.

4) I never outright predict our matches, I'm too superstitious. I will say that I think there will definitely be goals scored, as in several.

5) I think it's a very important match and also not a very important one. I know that sounds weird, but Liverpool, Everton, and ManU all have to play City again, with only Liverpool being at home. I would bet on three City wins. If we lose, it's certainly not the end of the world. If we draw, it will be a very well earned point. However, if we win, that could be a serious difference maker in the season. We could potentially pick up 3 points that no other team rivaling us for top 4 will pick up this season.",0,1390346127,null,0,false,0,cevgrrb,t3_1vs2o5,t1_cevgrrb,t3_1vs2o5,null,1432045265,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

* Regarding the policy of internet-filtering in general and your suggestion that HMG is incentivised to utilise the private sector to implement its policies; can you assess whether internet-filtering came about because it was a policy the Government could offer the public and didn't need to execute itself, or is it part of a more concrete desire to filter access to the internet and it is only the implementation itself (in which responsibility for filtering lies with ISPs) which has occurred because of variable political factors (saving money, ducking responsibility, etc.) ?",0,1390346970,null,0,1390348131,0,cevh6a9,t3_1vsva0,t1_cevh6a9,t3_1vsva0,null,1432045468,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Spending huge sums like that really doesn't seem to fit with FSG's transfer strategies of keeping net transfer spending fairly sensible. £40m is almost half of our entire net spend for the last 5 years. 

Given Arsenal only paid £42m for Ozil I'd say the Mata figure seems a bit inflated too (go figure, it's January).

&gt;

&gt;**Cabin Pressure** is a radio situation comedy series written by John Finnemore. Its first series was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2008. The show follows the exploits of the oddball crew of the single aeroplane owned by ""MJN Air"" as they are chartered to take all manner of items, people or animals across the world. The show stars Stephanie Cole, Roger Allam, Benedict Cumberbatch and John Finnemore.

&gt;Critical reception to the series was positive and four series have been produced, along with a special 2010 Christmas Day episode. The fourth series consisting of six episodes was broadcast in January and February 2013. The final special episode, a 45 minute long special entitled ""Zurich"", will be recorded in early 2014.  The series' opening music is Mikhail Glinka's Overture to Ruslan and Lyudmila.

true,DeathByCocktail,,Rye Manhattan,"Alrighty, **wall of text incoming**. I tend to cook in batches as it's cheaper and I'm lazy when just cooking for the two of us (and if it's just for me I'm probably going to make a sandwich or Pot Noodle but hey).

I knocked up some chicken soup base tonight, which is as simple as you like. It seems a bit daft to post the recipe but the base is incredibly versatile so I'll pop it up anyway- this is enough to make maybe 8 or 10 portions of soup or stew, and you can scale it up or down appropriately. It's pretty much impossible to fuck up and, whilst this is a long post, there's bigger all to it when you break it down. 

**Chicken soup/broth base**

You will need:

* 2kg chicken legs/thighs/drumsticks. If you want to knock this down into a stock ^^will ^^get ^^to ^^that ^^later then get some wings in there too, as they do add a bit of flavour and will help set the stock into a jelly that's easy to work with (think Knorr Stock Pots). 

* A mirepoix - this is just equal parts carrot and celery, and twice as much onion. For this amount I'm looking at two decent onions, three carrots and four celery sticks but YYMV based on the size of them. Now, peel your veg. No, really. I know it's a faff but it does give you a cleaner flavour and this is going to make a load of food, so take the five minutes. I use one of [these](http://www.amazon.co.uk/WMF-Profi-Swivel-Vegetable-Peeler/dp/B00008XWO7/ref=pd_sim_kh_28) as I like WMF and their tools last for ages, but a knife is fine if you don't have a peeler. Chop the veg but don't worry too much about size as you're going to strain it off later.

* Your bouquet garni- this is just a wee parcel of herbs that will add more flavour. Lay a bit of butcher's string on your board and put on a bay leaf, a of sprig of rosemary and couple of thyme, making a sandwich. Put another bay leaf on top and tie it all together so that nothing's going to come loose. If you don't have string you can just pop the lot in separately, it'll just take a bit of faffing to fish the bits out later.

* A few dried black peppercorns. These aren't massively important, and I prefer a bit white pepper for chicken (that's just black pepper that's been aged longer and adds more heat) but you can always season to taste later.

* A big pot. The one I use for stuff like this holds 9 litres but 6ish will do if you're cooking this amount.

* *Optional* - a smaller pot- doesn't have to be huge, maybe a couple of litres.

* *Optional* - A sieve. The bigger the better, as it'll take less time to strain but at the end of the day a sieve's a sieve.

* One or two biggish bowls.

* One or two containers - you can clingfilm bowls if you're desperate.

* Tongs or a slotted spoon.


Put your mirepoix into the pot with a little bit of oil, over a medium-low heat and get it slowly cooking, moving it around every couple of minutes. If you're feeling flash you can roast the veg in the oven at 180 but there's no real point unless you're already using it. You want them starting to caramelize a little bit- so your onion is transparent and starting to turn golden, after 10 minutes or so. If you take them too far it's not the end of the world, just don't burn them. If you do it's pretty much game over, so chuck 
them and start again.

Once the veg is there, put your chicken in on top. If you're using whole legs you can joint them but I just leave them whole, as it's a bit less messy when it's time to strip off the meat.

Cover the chicken with water (i.e. add just enough to cover, don't go nuts) and whap in your herbs. From here on out it's pretty much a waiting game. Bring the pot to the boil, then bring it down to a simmer. Pop on a lid and wait. Do not let it boil. It'll take somewhere in the region of an hour so so. Do not let it boil. After maybe fifteen or twenty minutes, use a metal spoon (put it in the freezer for a bit and the fat will stick to it more easily) to skim the fat and scum from the surface. You'll want to do this once or twice, more if you have wings in there. Did I mention not letting it boil? Don't let it boil. It'll fuck the flavour.

After your hour or so, you should see that the meat is pulling away from the bone. This is a good thing. Get a knife or fork and shove it into the thickest parts of the meat (heh), and see if it's pulling away cleanly from the bone. If it is, you're done. If not, you'll probably want another fifteen minutes, tops. When it is, turn the heat off and use your tongs/slotted spoon to remove all of the chicken to your big bowl. Now, you want to get the skin off the chicken (chuck that) and as much meat as you can off of the bones. This is why I said two bowls- one for bones, the other for meat. Keep the bones for the moment until you know you don't want them. Asbestos fingers help here but do your best, and letting the meat rest for a few minutes doesn't do any harm. 

Get the meat into the fridge and cool it down. Unless you're cooking for a load of people you now have too much, and you want it cooled quickly because bacteria are not our friends. Just use it as you need it. It'll last for five days or so. If it starts fizzing (you'll know it when you see/smell it) then dump it immediately.

Remove your veg from the pot and chuck it. You can leave it in if you want, as it's not going to do you any harm but by this point you've got as much flavour as you're going to get out of it. Take the herbs out, though-nobody likes choking on a bay leaf. If you're using two pots, then pass the whole lot from the big pot into the smaller one though the sieve. Don't force it through, just let it sit for a bit. Only have one pot? Fish the bits out as best you can. You just want the soup in a pan to have as few bits in as possible. 

As with the meat, you've now got more broth/ soup base than you probably need. Get it into your other container and in the fridge. That's pretty much your basic base done. I'll add a couple of ideas of what you can do with it, though:

**Chicken Stock**

Okay, this isn't completely kosher as you'd normally start with roasted bones but fuck it, times are hard. I'm assuming that you're using all of the liquid you just used from your base here but, ultimately, there's no suxh thing as too many bones so don't worry too much about having used some of the brother for something else.

Now, those bones you kept aside after picking the bird? Get them onto a roasting tray and toss them in a little bit of oil. Not virgin olive. We're not foreign and that crap starts smoking as soon as you look at it, and heating it kills the flavour- save it for dressings. Normal olive is fine, as is pretty much any other normal oil. No butter, though, it has the same problem as the virgin stuff. You're not deep frying them, you just want to get some colour on them without them burning. If you can be arsed to break the bigger ones on your board a bit (use the heel of your knife- the thick bit on the back of the blade close to the handle- or anything else heavy like a rolling pin, though you probably want some cling film or a poly bag covering them if you do that, or a brick, your other half's forehead if it's been sterilised) then you're going to get more flavour from them. It's not a big deal if you can't though. Get them on the tray and into the oven at 180. You're going to want to check them and turn them over in the tray with your tongs every ten minutes or so. Try not to burn your wrist onto the top of the oven while doing this. That sucks and the scars last for ages. After twenty or thirty minutes, they'll change colour- get them out of there. Any black bits? Chuck them. They're bitter and will fuck your stock.

Take your bones and get them back into your pot of beautifully crafted stock. Now bring it up to a mere simmer and get the lid back on. That's it. You can now bugger off for half an hour at a time, if not more. Just check it occasionally and make sure it isn't boiling. You really don't want it to boil. I may have mentioned that. Every time you check it, turn the the bones around a bit in the pot. You don't need to go mad, you just don't want anything to catch, as that'll go bitter. You can give this a good twelve hours if you can be bothered. The longer you leave it for, the richer and thicker it'll be. When you're happy with it, pass it through a sieve and enjoy a few meals worth of glorious sauces and anything else you can think of. Taste it, though- it'll be very strong, so you'll want to let it down with some water or wine, or it'll be far too strong. For example, fry off some shallot, a bit of your cooked chicken and some morel mushrooms, add a bit of cream and you've got a gorgeous pasta sauce. You can do all sorts with it.

**Easy ""Chinese"" Soup**

I say ""Chinese"" but this is just your generic UK Asian-style stuff in a bowl. Works for me, as it's quick and easy. For two people, add three or four ladles of your soup base to a pot, along with a good handful of chicken. Bring it up to a simmer. Now whap in half a bag of beansprouts (200g, 50p at Morrision's at the mo), a bit of garlic (cut the clove in half and take the germ out, then slice it finely), a bit of ginger (the frozen fresh stuff is pretty good if you don't use it often, otherwise you want maybe an inch of fresh, cut into wee strips or julienned), and a chili or two if you like heat, and let those cook for five or six minutes. Now slice some pak choi or some Chinese leaves, and put them in for a couple of minutes to get them just cooked but still having a bit of bite. I also add some of [this stuff](http://www.dealz.ie/food-and-drink/grocery/gravy-and-sauces/heinz-worcestershire-sauce-150ml) which turns up occasionally in cash and carries, though I don't think I've seen it in supermarkets. Good if you can find it, though. 

Whap your bowls in the microwave for a minute or so, to keep it hot, and serve up. Again, it sounds like a lot of work but it's just stuff in a bowl.

I heard the lead UK censorship admin originally had a system websites could only be added to the list, and accidentally added their own website (I believe). So they actually sent an email to the tor developers to get around their own censorship.

You might find it interesting that China actually is somewhat careful abt it because mistakes could have immediate economic impacts for the superpower. One example is that thetorproject got blocked for a week, and everything was fine again. Dingledine, head of the nonprofit, believes that it was due to an explicit policy to avoid the accidental censorship situation. China apparently probes websites individually to also make the targeting more accurate and effective.

Yes, he also said what you said that about displays of power, except that it is only important if most ppl are unable to get past it (unless there's a special occasion).

If you mean the backbone (like Tempora) the answer is 'very low' in my opinion. The reason being is that [Cleanfeed-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanfeed_%28content_blocking_system%29#Technical_Detection) blocking is quite easy to detect. If this were implemented on an ISP core router somewhere a block could be detected from anywhere in the UK. This would then be the responsibility of a high level internet org, like [LINX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Internet_Exchange) who are B2B only.

Currently detection is ISP-specific and blocking owned by the ISP - which is how the government likes it.

&gt; Regarding the policy of internet-filtering in general and your suggestion that HMG is incentivised to utilise the private sector to implement its policies

Absolutely. The government gets to have it's cake (we're doing something about the filth online! The government cares about the children!) and eat it too (any errors are the responsibility of the ISPs and their technology companies in a strictly commercial relationship).

&gt; can you assess whether internet-filtering came about because it was a policy the Government could offer the public and didn't need to execute itself vs [active plan]

To their credit(?) I don't believe the government has **led** a single initiative when it comes to web blocking policy. In every case they have responded to lobbyists and interest groups.

* File sharing site blocking - right holder lobbyists bypassing government
* Obscenity blocking - public campaigns against 'extreme porn'
* IWF Child porn blocking - police lobbying
* Extremism blocking - public sector lobbying from prisons
* Default web blocking - mums net and parents groups

Of course the government has **allowed** themselves to be lobbied into this position (where they could have resisted) because it's in their interest for ISPs to have huge 'kill switches' in place around our national infrastructure. They said it themslves, they would want to [shutdown social media sites](http://metro.co.uk/2011/08/11/uk-riots-david-cameron-hints-at-social-media-shutdown-117028/) like Twitter in the event of rioting.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"1.  Success to me is not the result, but the performance.  We were so horrendously bad last time around, that I would take a 0-1 or 0-2 loss to be honest as long as we don't give up meekly.  Fight, aggression, creativity, and possession is what I want.  My gravest fear is us doing what we did against City and Liverpool, which is panic every time we get the ball, lose it cheaply, and make stupid defensive errors that practically gift goals to the best forwards in the country.  Being opened up by a world class player like Aguero or Silva is not so much of a problem... I just want us to make it as hard for them as physically possible.

2.  Formation is not as important as how the players are deployed.  I would potentially play Eriksen on the left (as opposed to off the striker as he did last match), allowing him to freely drift in field.  I think playing him as a CAM will see him crowded out by Toure and Fernandinho. Also think we need a CDM.  The Dembele/Bentaleb combination leaves too much space between the lines, where the likes of Silva and Aguero will flourish.  Every time we lose possession, Toure will have acres of space to burst into unless we have someone in there, whether it's Sandro or Capoue.  Up front I wouldn't mind seeing both Soldado and Adebayor.  Ade will drop back into midfield to compete with Fernandinho and Toure (probably our only attacking player who can do so), which means we still need someone up front to occupy the CBs.  I'm not expecting Soldado to get much change from Kompany, but we need someone taking up good positions in the box to pin their defence back and create space for Eriksen and whoever is playing right wing.  I doubt it'll happen, but I don't think it's the worst idea to play Naughton at RB and Walker as right mid this match, particularly if Silva starts on the left.

3.  I think Sherwood will play something similar to the Swansea lineup, save for potentially sacrificing Bentaleb or Dembele for Sandro if he's fit.  I can't help but think the decision to play one striker in that match was a dress rehearsal for City.

4.  If I was putting money on any result, I'd say we'd lose 0-2.  City are going to score... I think that's inevitable.  And our philosophy is never to sit back and defend when we're down.  I think we'll cautiously press and press for an equaliser, but City will nick a second late goal with us committing men forward.  Unfortunately our record against the big teams is not very good in recent history (save for at Old Trafford!).  City are just one of those teams where you have to factor in losing both games at the start of the season I feel.  Doesn't at all mean we should be resigned to the fact, and I want the boys to fight to the death.  But I don't think losing at home will change anything much for us.

If you're just sending a message to a black guy telling him he's a ""banana-munching nigger cunt"" then I really don't see how freedom of speech covers that - or why anyone would honestly uphold freedom of speech/opinion as something that should. 

As to whether sending someone racist verbal abuse is so much worse than similarly hateful but non-racist verbal abuse (which AFAIK you can't be arrested for unless you threaten their person), IDK, but I think that's a different argument. Hate speech is hate speech, and it's fairly widely accepted over here that you can't just use ""omg no freedom of speech"" as a valid defence for calling black people ""nigger"", ""coon"", etc.

United look like a sinking ship currently, and they dont look like a place to go in the long run, but Liverpool are starting to look strong, and seem to have forward momentum. As you said, he would walk into any team in the world but only a few of those would play him week in week out, where you can absolutely guarantee he would at Liverpool.

In a world cup year, in a very very competitive national team with a very good chance of winning the thing, Juan Mata will want to be part of that, and he will only get that chance playing games.

Yes he will get those games playing for United, but i feel it would take more than Mata to make United tick better. He would fit our system better and would be playing for a team that genuinely looks like it is enjoying its football.

I cant vouch for his character, but for me, if he had his head screwed on, Liverpool would be one of his better options.

- Games are being lost in defensive midfield and the defensive line. Our weakest positions depth-wise and talent wise are DM and LB/RB respectively. We could even use another CB. CAM the last position we need to strengthen to become a top 4 team - we are scoring enough goals.

- Liverpool FC is in horrible debt. The club does not make a profit. FSG is lending the club money to keep it a viable challenger. They are not going to want to spend ridiculous amounts on players if they don't see themselves getting that money back, let alone if the player isn't even what the club needs most to improve.

I'm happy to say that BR and FSG will not sign Mata no matter how much certain fans want it. It's not in the best interest of LFC. BR knows it. FSG knows it. LFC's return to the CL, big money, and big signings will be a slow and steady one.

true,test1121,eu,European Union,"Ok firstly: the borders drawn on the countries are inconsistent and unhelpful. Since you're trying to illustrate the differences between the UK, Britain, England/Scotland/Wales, Ireland etc. those are the borders your map should have. Instead it seems to show no borders on Ireland and the (I think) Ceremonial County divisions on Great Britain.

Seconly, the flags used are similarly inconsistent. In size (likely to offend the easily offended) and in the case of Northern Ireland, wrong. The Northern Irish Flag should be like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/St_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg/800px-St_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg.png).

Your labels are unhelpfully placed and make no reference of the fact that the Republic of Ireland (Eire) is a different country. The United Kingdom includes the countries of Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) as well as Northern Ireland. Altogether, these are the British Isles, but the Union flag (Union jack) belongs next to the term United Kingdom and not at the top next to British Isles (A purely geographic term).

""Isle of Mann"" should read ""Isle of Man""; plus, if you including this, you should arguably also include the channel islands as they have the same legal status (Crown Dependency). You also seem to have managed to cut the Shetland Islands off your map. (They belong [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Shetland_UK_location_map.svg/315px-Shetland_UK_location_map.svg.png))

1) no clear boundaries between England, Scotland and Wales.

2) the flags cover up information.

3) all of the flags except England dont have a border and are white, this means they blend into the background.

4) the flag for northern Ireland isn't on northern Ireland. 

5) the isle of man(n?) Isn't that important tbh, no offence to anyone living there but you've covered up the isle of Wight and dont show the Shetland islands (I dont think so anyway), the channel islands aren't included either so I would drop the isle of Mann title

6) although white allows everything to be seen easily the general map colour for land seems to be green. If you use different shades of green you can easily differentiate the different countries in the UK and keep a bold border with the republic of Ireland.

7) the flag sizes are different, this makes it look disjointed. Make them all smaller and the same size or dont include them at all. Text can just as easily show which country is which.

8) the text can be changed so it doesn't clash with the map so much, I would make it smaller and place just over each country.

9) I dont know if you need county divisions if you do, keep them, if not, dont.

10) look at what the British isles refers to, AFAIK it refers to both the UK and the republic of Ireland, if so, dont put a UK flag next to it.

11) Eire is spelt wrong, northern Ireland doesn't need ulster in brackets next to it.

12) the united kingdom should be in larger text than the individual names but should be the same weight and font as that of the republic of Ireland. It should be smaller than it is, make it so it doesn't cover such a large portion of the map.

Sorry if this seems like a lot of criticism but these changes would probably make it look a lot better. I am not a mapmaker but I think these changes would help a lot.

&gt; Everton has spent more time in the top flight of English soccer than any other team in history.

&gt; This song  and this little ditty are the big ones to know.

&gt; The nickname ""The Toffees"" probably stems from a toffee shop in Everton village from back when Everton moved to Goodison Park. Nowadays, Everton mints are thrown into the crowd by a Toffee Lady.

&gt; We're also known as ""The School of Science"" because of our traditionally technical and beautiful style of play.

&gt; Dixie Dean set the record for most goals in a season in 1927-28, a record which still stands today.

&gt; Our club motto is ""Nil Satis Nisi Optimum,"" which means ""Nothing but the best is good enough."" Supporters care quite a bit about it, and there was a great deal of controversy when it didn't appear on the badge this year. We often abbreviate it as NSNO, and use it as a sign-off on message boards and such.

&gt; “I’d break every bone in my body for any club I play for but I’d die for Everton.” - Dave Hickson. Just about sums up how much passion people feel for our club.

I don't really understand why anyone would do this though) which might be cheaper but I wouldn't count on it since it's not an exchange - you just get whatever price they give you.

Of course their contributions do not match what they take out because the pound is purposely devalued, but this is not their fault. The govt. devalue it so they can manage the state's debt.

And this is the problem. We have created a society where people do not factor the expenses they will have when they are no longer able to work.

This actually increases the cost of things like housing because they have more available income to spend on it and prices are always what people are willing to pay. They don't have to worry about retirement so they pay more. This means housing prices rise for everyone and more people cannot afford it, so more state debt is created to pay for it and so the pound is devalued to pay the debt and on and on...

This is my lineup, I would really like to see Cabaye in this team. I know he is world class and just needs quality players around him to shine. He always gets in great positions and is overall a solid midfielder. He would complement Henderson very well, who is ready for a bigger responsibility in our midfield.

I started to learn about Spurs when I saw we became partner clubs and at the time I didn't have a club to follow. After reading up on the history and looking at the people who played (Klinnsman was the big one for me) as well as who played for them at the time (Bale, Modric, VdV, etc.) I was drawn to the club. So the partnership brought me in, it isn't as if I was only a supporter because of it. I've stuck around through a lot and I love the team almost as much as I love the Quakes here at home.

If you want to know about the Quakes and their history, [I wrote a brief bit on it last year.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/195th1/san_jose_earthquakes_countdown_to_kickoff/) I have thought about posting about the team during the EPL's offseason but I was afraid people wouldn't care about the team now that we lost Dawkins. If you want to find out more, go to /r/SJEarthquakes.

If you want to check out any games I suggest to start looking at their games against LA, the California Clasico. 

* In 2003 they staged the biggest and greatest comeback in MLS history when [they beat LA 5-4 on aggregate in a playoff series.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0owvnCPzk) 

* [2012 Featured another come from behind win against a team that featured Beckham, Donovan, and Keane.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jYIEcQmnaU) Wondolowski is the star player of the Quakes and he won the game on a beautiful backheel.

&gt;Upwards of 20 million pounds was spent on Iago Aspas, Tiago Ilori and Luis Alberto, while loan signings Cissokho and Moses have fared little better. They've at least managed to get on the field occasionally, but have hardly covered themselves in glory, especially when compared with the loanees at Everton, for instance.

&gt;That 20 million could have bought one top-quality midfield player to go straight into the side, instead it bought one lad who is now out on loan without having kicked a ball in anger, a 26-year-old with just one season of topflight football under his belt who has looked completely out of his depth in the Premier League, and a 20-year-old who was hooked at halftime against League One Oldham Athletic. Two of those may become good players in the future, but that's not what Liverpool needed last summer; they needed players who could contribute now.

Obviously easier said than done to just say, hey, here's 20 million pounds and invest in one player especially when there seemed to be so many question marks throughout the summer.

However, now that we're in January, I think it is *a bit* easier to go out and invest in that - cliche coming up - *""impact player""*.

Of course, we can bandy about a lot of names but I'm not about to fall into that discussion/speculation of random players. But here's what I do know:

* Suarez and Sturridge are scoring a disproportionate amount of goals for LFC.
* Lucas showed his importance in that Aston Villa match and his loss will be felt.
* Our defense - for a variety of reasons - has looked shaky as of late and with Enrique's injury and the seemingly extended dip in form of Glen Johnson, our fullbacks haven't looked as dynamic or dangerous.

In my opinion (nothing new or controversial, I think), those are three areas we need to improve. And as long as we get that ""impact player"" to improve one of those areas, I think I will be happy. I doubt we will be able to address *all* issues. And I'd rather trust our transfer committee, maybe even gamble a bit and invest in just *one* player and then trust that the rest of the team can get healthy, stay healthy, improve and carry on.

My one gripe is that the writing was a little cliche. It's as if the author went out of his way to have certain characters say a catchphrase to someone from the other fiction just to check the fanservice box. Despite the shortcomings, I'd recommend it. It's fun and light, and that's really the point of a comic, isn't it?

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Alpha***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha) : 

---

&gt;

&gt;**Alpha** (uppercase **Α**, lowercase **α**; Greek: Άλφα Álpha) is the first letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 1. It was derived from the Phoenician letter aleph . Letters that arose from alpha include the Latin A and the Cyrillic letter А.

&gt;In English, the noun ""alpha"" is used as a synonym for ""beginning"", or ""first"" (in a series), reflecting its Greek roots.

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Push and run***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%20and%20run) : 

---

&gt;

&gt;**Push-and-run**, also known as a **one-two**, a **wall pass** or a **give-and-go**, is a tactic often used in association football. It was devised and developed by Arthur Rowe, who was the then manager of English football club Tottenham Hotspur from 1949.

&gt;The push-and-run style involved quickly laying the ball off to a teammate and running past the marking tackler to collect the return pass. It proved an effective way to move the ball at pace, with players' positions and responsibility being fluid.

&gt;Implementing this new and unique style, Tottenham ran away with their first ever league title. In 1951 they won the First Division Championship and became the first side to win Second and First Divisions in successive seasons.

Were they justified in using force in this situation. By her own admission it seems, she was obstructing a constable in the course of their duty.

Possibly common law self defence if they felt she meant to attack them. 

The question therefore is was the amount of force used reasonable? The officer has to make a dynamic threat assessment. In a hostile crowd, trying to arrest offender, unknown party keeping us held in crowd, threat assessment is going to greatly elevated. If the officer was holding the arm of a suspect then they may only have their legs to defend themselves. If she was told to ""get back"" or ""get off him"" and didn't do so the officer would be justified in delivering further strikes.

The exterior of the TARDIS is roughly the size of a police box, but the interior exists in a sort of pocket dimension inside of the shell. The shell could fit into something much much smaller than the interior of the TARDIS.

For example, you could store the TARDIS inside of a small spaceship and the spaceship would be smaller than the interior of the TARDIS itself.

So as long as as my stomach is bigger than the exterior of the pancake TARDIS, I should have no trouble eating it. (Though, I guess if my teeth breaks apart the exterior, the interior would expand or something.)

Reasons : 

1) He is a asset, RESPECTED Player within the team, supporters and also the rivals.
2) He is absolute CLASS.
3) He isnt a problem on or off the field, Media doesnt have anything to write in the weekdays so they are fuelling this.
4) Even if Mata wants to leave, *loan him* to Manchester United, as he may get the playing time and prepare himself for the *World cup*
5) He isnt on massive wages, he is very very modestly payed and it aint a problem for anyone of us.
6) We dont need money, we aint Arsenal who need money and get it by selling their talent to the rivals.

Allen is not a defensive midfielder by trade, but we saw him cover for Lucas before and he was excellent while his fitness lasted. Definitely good enough for us to have a chance to remain in 4th. Even with Lucas, top 4 is never guaranteed.

And if I can see that, if the supporters can see that, then surely Rodgers and FSG see that as well and will make the necessary moves to improve the squad.

Suffice to say, the headline is misleading.

Lonsdale Bar have had a lot of problems with students getting so drunk they end up hospitalised. Lonsdale is basically known as the 'party college' on campus and their bar is the one that most resembles a nightclub in aesthetic and vibe. The dean, Richard Austen-Baker, is a larger than life law professor prone to making eccentric comments. He once wrote to Private Eye saying bus lanes should be outlawed because they prioritise people on low incomes who are of less value to the economy.

So, basically the Deanery of Lancaster or of any university (I believe) has the right to fine students for doing ANYTHING that is illegal under English Law. Being drunk and disorderly and serving intoxicated people alcohol are both illegal, so technically there is authority for the Deanery to do this.

The college didn't actually intend to enforce this 'ban' on being drunk - they were rather artlessly trying to remind students that getting or allowing their friends to get so drunk they end up in hospital can in theory be coupled with a fine, and is more importantly illegal, and were trying to discourage people from doing it.",0,1390375149,null,0,1390375337,0,cevstq4,t3_1vhcl2,t1_cevstq4,t3_1vhcl2,null,1432051671,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
