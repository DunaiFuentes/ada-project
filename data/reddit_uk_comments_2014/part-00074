true,j00pY,UnionFlag,SW London - ZX6R-A1P,"Trust me when I say that you don't want to get a new bike for your first learner bike. You are more than likely to drop it and you lose a ton of cash on new bikes.

My first two bikes were new and I lost loads of cash on them. My Mum thought she knew best and 2nd hand would just mean unreliable. I was only a teenager and didn't know better and my dad has zero interest in bikes. My new bikes have both been far more unreliable than any 2nd hand bike I have bought since. I'd never waste cash now on a new bike. I'd much rather get an almost new and spend the savings on kit for the bike.

true,LFCCalgary,null,null,"With all due respect to Lucas I think he has lost his spot in the starting XI. He is good at what he does and there is still a place for him in the team but our best midfield has been Gerrard sitting deep with Hendo and one of Coutinho or Allen ahead of him. 

Where Lucas now fits in is if we need to gain control of a game he may replace Gerrard. He could also play further forward where Allen tends to play. He showed promise the one time he played there this season, making great runs into the box and linking with Suarez and Sturridge well. He did lack quality finishing though. But given time he could do alright there. (Apparently he used to be more of an attacking mid at Gremio).

One thing that we have learned this season is that a midfield with Gerrard beside Lucas doesn't look very good. It works in that we've ground out results playing that way but we look so static and slow. It almost seems like they are each waiting for the other to make a defensive play when opponents attack down the middle. When either of them play alone in that DM spot they take charge of the situation knowing they don't have a partner to fall back on. 

Also, Rodgers seems to be reluctant to ever push Gerrard further up the field anymore. He has also come out and said he prefers to play a 1-2 midfield three as opposed to a 2-1. I think this means Lucas will be second choice to Gerrard for a while in that position.

It's not like there are check points being set up and if you fail some sexual orientation quiz, you are denied entry to march. They are simply being denied the opportunity to march under a banner proclaiming their sexual identity, a not unreasonable request. As someone who has marched in the St. Patrick's Day parade in NYC, we don't march under banners of sexuality, eye color, height, etc. I don't wear a sash identifying as Heterosexual. Why should there be those marching in a rainbow sash or behind a gay pride banner? There's absolutely no rhyme or reason to identify by your sexuality at this parade. It's about the many different civic and social clubs that make up the Irish and and Irish American community in the area. If you happen to be gay, that's great and awesome. Good on you and you are more than welcome to march! However, your sexuality bares zero relevancy to anything going on that day. As an Irish American, I don't show up at the parades of other nationalities, like the Puerto Rican Day Parade or the Columbus Day Parade and insist upon making the goings on about me and mine.

true,pjz4302,null,null,"No we really don't. Of course rehabilitation in the prison system can be improved (and is constantly improving)

What we need is a greater deterrent (the heavy sentencing of rioters in Northern Ireland is a great example and it is going to be very effective.)

We need greater support for prisoners once they are released, no good getting a drug addict into prison, rehabilitate them, get them clean, release them outside and then end up with no work and no hope and then end up back on the drugs and getting back to crime, undermining all the good rehabilitation work done. We treat the symptom and not the cause behind drug addictions.

We need more disciplines in the prisons, honestly they are run by the consent of the prisoners, strict regimes and stability of routines are not being upheld, leading the prisoners to think they can do what they want and authority means little.

We need better addiction counselling, many prisoners have addiction problems.

We need better mental health care, a huge portion of prisoners have mental health issues, which are not supported well outside of prison. Some of these prisoners should not be in prison honestly.

We need to have a huge deterrent for young offenders, scare them straight basically. The young offenders get treated far too leniently and obviously nothing is their fault so there is no reason for them to take any responsibility for their actions. They see the move from a young offenders centre to a jail as being a big boost to their ego.

We need something to stop repeat offending, I have seen people with over 150 convictions get very light sentences only for them to come straight back in. Same goes for breaching bail, especially with young offenders, some will breach bail 7 or 8 times in a row, always getting bail again just to go and break it again. It means nothing if its not enforced. Sentences for repeat offending need to be increased, such as a three strikes rule or something. Breach bail three times and no more bail. It would work. Same goes for offending. Steal a car and get a sentence of a year say. Steal another and you get a year plus have to re-do the first year. Do it again and it increases even more dramatically. There is no deterrent for these repeat offenders. This would serve many purposes 1, it would keep them off the streets longer and the individual CANNOT reoffend when in prison. 2, punishment, self explanatory. 3, deterrent, they will think twice about doing it and 4, allows more time for rehabilitation as it obviously hasn't worked.

We need to get rid of privatised prisons, they don't work and people are going to get hurt because of it.

And finally we need more and better paid prison officers, they do good work but are stretched too thin and are burning out in these last few years.

This is a subject close to my heart so I'm sorry for being a bit preachy and ranting, but prisons are a closed environment so most people don't understand them fully, and often the story told is the prisoners and they will always play the victim card. For the majority of them they have poor impulse control, poor coping strategies, low education, poor mental health, addiction issues and a complete inability to take responsibility for their actions. Most reoffending could be stopped, not all. And the worst for the reoffending are the youths that get away with it early on who just laugh at police, the courts and jail. This needs to be nipped in the bud so to speak and more focus placed there on all aspects of the use of prison. Namely deterrent, public protection, rehabilitating and punishment. Then the ""aftercare"" of prisoners needs to be improved.

Some form of military service would be a great help to most of the young lads who have never had any self respect, father figures, role models, respect, routine, responsibility or all that. It would also make them employable.


And the whole punishment or rehabilitation only arguement pisses me off. A prison has four roles which is public protection (most important in my opinion), deterrant (not only for prisoners but for every one else, I dont go around assaulting people because its wrong and id go to prison), rehabilitation and punishment. All four can and do work together in every prison in the world, just each prison system has different priorities. The UK is far more rehabilitation focused than the US which is more Punishment focused.

true,ctesibius,UnionFlag,Various Triumphs,"Firstly, you're right.

However there is some rationality to what they say. Cars in the USA are a lot cheaper (and tinnier) than here, they don't have MOTs, and in some states insurance is optional. Even where insurance is compulsory, you decide how much 3rd party coverage you need, and $50k of cover is cheap. You just run the risk of being sued into oblivion by a third party if your insurance won't cover your liability. So running a car is really cheap there.

The other point is their training. Often (always?) you get a bike ""endorsement"" on a car licence, i.e. you have to get car training first. The car test can make the MSF look like a doctorate in astrophysics. I saw a Minnesota test 20 years back. You had to drive the car around a space the size of a football field, making two right turns at the corners. Then drive it back, making two left turns. There is a reason why for many countries (France, Germany etc.) you can exchange their licence for a UK one, and the USA is not on that list. 

So a car driver takes the MSF. He learns about using a non-automatic gearbox. He has to ""control"" two separate brakes - I use the word control loosely here, because of that lethal rubbish they teach about not releasing the brake if it locks ""to avoid a highside"". He learns about taking observation half-way seriously.

So you end up with someone who's effectively taken the CBT, teetering along on the latest rocket on roads crammed with brain-dead car drivers who *haven't* taken anything as advanced as CBT. The roads become slippery in the rain because of the oil that leaks from those archaic car engines, so it gets even more frightening than usual. So yes, they keep the bike for a nice sunny day, and keep to country roads rather than city commuting.

And because they don't understand the rest of the world, they think everywhere else is like that. They don't understand the Brit running a CG125 rat on L plates through the winter to get to work. They don't understand that he gets as much experience in a month as they do in a year. They don't understand that this learner has long ago mastered the art of smoothly slipping through traffic, always in the right place, never surprised by someone else's mistake. They don't understand that this novice will change his oil, chain or tyres on the street outside his bedsit in the rain if he has to, and he'll do it right, with a basic toolkit.",0,1394836609,null,0,false,0,cg2t7px,t3_2058p2,t1_cg2t7px,t3_2058p2,null,1432803885,5,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,5

true,[deleted],null,null,"Looking at this article from last week,

http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/03/05/uk-shocking-image-teeth-left-smashed-homophobic-teen-attack/ it says 

&gt;“I heard a group of men shouting homophobic abuse at me,” he told RadioWave FM. “The next thing I know I woke up covered in blood, I had lost my teeth, blood all down my arms and I was stumbling across Preston trying to find my friends.”

So it seems like while pissed, he heard homophobic shit shouted at him, fell and injured himself, and upon waking connected the homophobic abuse to his injuries. I think that's why the police are saying they believe he really did think he was assaulted.

Stating it was an attack when you can't remember the attack itself wasn't a great idea, but it's fairly reasonable to think it was an attack if the last thing you remember is homophobic stuff being shouted at you and then you wake up injured. He was jumping to conclusions, but he didn't necessarily just make it all up.

He wrote this in a fb comment as well

&gt;I haven’t lied to anyone or about anything, my genuinely belief was due to previous events in the night and the state I was in, I put 2 and 2 together and unfortunately got 5, my lack of memory of the night which I made clear from the beginning of the investigation did not support me in any form.

I've not had a WK myself, so can't comment on the make. However on the general features:

* Upside down forks: I'd avoid these. The idea is that they reduce the unsprung weight, which can be important on race bikes. However with the cheap suspension on a road 125, it's pointless. It also means that the chrome parts of the fork legs are more exposed to road damage. Do bear in mind that I'm an old conservative who fits fork gaiters to every bike I buy.
* [Braided brake lines](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Goodridge-Universal-Platinum-Clear-Chrome/dp/B000GZIOEI): they make the feel of your brakes harder. Good when you have more experience, but also more likely to make you over-brake and lock the wheel. In any case, you can fit them yourself.
* Liquid cooled engine: more of an advantage for the manufacturer than for you. If the engine isn't reliable with air cooling, they shouldn't sell it with air cooling.

true,GaProgMan,null,null,"### Actual answer to OP's question

I can't answer for every profession, but I will say this: the important thing, as /u/woxy_lutz is that you get out of life what you put in. The more effort you put in preparing for exams, the more choices you'll have once you've passed - and you'll pass, you just have to take it easy and put the effort in.

&gt; just curious how important they really are

It all depends on where you want to go in life. If you want to get out of school and into a job, then they're *HUGELY* important. Getting into college: also important. Getting into university: not so much, because your A-Level grades are more important.

Let me turn the question around on you and ask what it is that you want to do with life?

### Personal example

I came out of school with 9 x C's and 2 x D's, so I didn't do perfectly, but I got where I wanted to go. I got into college with my grades (I did electronics, programming, IT and physics), then get into Uni with the grades I got from college. Each step of the way, I put it more and more effort and was rewarded for it (I have a pretty good degree, can speak 3 languages and lived in Japan for a while).

You wont stop learning once you get out of school, even if you don't end up going to college. Plus, you can re-sit your GCSEs at college (but why do it all again, in a single year?).

### Generic ""Advice""

Practise, practise, practise. Ask your teachers for help - never be afraid to ask a question - even if you have to do it after class (if you're worried about your mates seeing). Get some homework. Do some Googling on things you're not sure about (but check against a text book or teacher before you take it as rote). Your teachers wont know what's on this year's paper, but they'll know what was on all of the previous papers, so they can point you in the right direction on what *you* (specifically) need to focus on.

### Side note
I used to work in a school and saw this all the time. You just need to try to stay calm as you approach the exam. It might be worth taking an hour or two to teach yourself mindfulness meditation (tl;dr - close your eyes and breathe deeply, push all of your attention to the breath, when a thought comes allow it to be, then bring your attention back to your breath) I found it very calming when I was at uni (I studied Computer Science and am a programmer these days).

One tip that a fellow intervention session provider taught me (back when I used to run maths intervention sessions) was how to take a maths exam:

* Read through the paper, making notes on questions that you have an idea about
* Read through it again, answering all the questions that you can do instantly, skipping out the ones you have to think about
* Read through it again, answering the ones yo have to think about
* Read through it again, making extended notes on how you would solve the questions that you're not sure on

Remember (at least in maths/science), you'll still get marks for putting down your working out, even if you get it wrong. If a question is worth 5 marks, only 1 of those marks is for the answer. Write down how you worked out the answer as well as the answer.

Got a question on Pythagoras' theory on triangles? The first thing you write down is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, then fill in the numbers, then work out the answer.",0,1394838296,null,0,1394838783,0,cg2twaj,t3_20fhmf,t1_cg2twaj,t3_20fhmf,null,1432804211,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

Because of two things:

* The folks writing the syllabus have no idea what's needed in the market so they cater for on the lowest common denominator (""I can open a document, save... save as... print.... print preview"")
* A lot of SysAdmins in schools get shirty when staff ask for new software, let alone a system where the kids can go wild and learn how it works.

I personally think that IT could be scrapped as it is. Take what was being taught and bolt it on to English and foreign languages (using a word processor to type stuff up is all about the correct use of language), and History and R.E/Ethics (using Power Point to create presentations based on points of view).

Then replace what was IT with basic Computer Science. Teach kids how to network machines together; how to build PCs; how to troubleshoot a faulty computer.

1. What would you describe as the rough ideological positions of the Green Party NI in general apart from Green politics? 

2. What would you guys do for more local community autonomy instead of decisions being made in Stormont? This particularly concerns me with fracking in Fermanagh and the nuclear disaster zone on Queen's Parade, Bangor. What can we do to have communities making decisions and not out of touch politicians on the hill and more importantly what would the Greens do?

3. I'm a Libertarian Socialist who is open to the idea of voting if it really can be sold to me that it will work in my favour and have much less government in my life and more involved in keeping big business/cooperations in check and keeping our country a clean environment for all people to use their shared green space. 

I've so far not been convinced enough to vote Green. Can you tell me any REAL reasons why I should vote Green instead of spoiling my vote again? I'm not talking manifesto talk. I'm talking what are you going to do to Northern Ireland for a normal everyday asshole like me?

Major companies in the republic pay an effective corporation tax rate of around 2.5% in ROI because of the tax structure, not the level at which it is set. We cannot compete with the South for this reason. Secondly the costs of corporation tax I believe are far too high (around £500m) and benefit big corporations at the expense of people at a time when we are facing a real shortfall in funding for things like the NHS. Lastly on another point I do not believe the notion that the economy can be too dependent on the public sector. We can be too dependent on funding from London but not too dependent on one particular sector. E.g. Privatising the NHS or our education system would make us less dependent on the public sector but I dont believe that just because an organisation is run by the private sector that it is a universal truth that it is the best way to run a business.

&gt;In reality, the truth is more straightforward. He has youth on his side at 22, but is old school in his approach – other than the fact he is strictly teetotal – and cherishes homespun values.

Do a Google search for ""Jordan Henderson teetotal"" and you'll get some more stuff from around the time he was breaking through at Sunderland. Seems like a dream to train.

&gt;He is teetotal and a non-smoker and he claimed to be ""a little bit boring, I guess"", his idea of a good night being ""watching the Chelsea game again on DVD"". He appears to be the antithesis of the stereotypical, scandal-inducing Premier League footballer.

But there are so many ways to mitigate PCC complaints that it's utterly pointless. And as I said, they deal on a case by case basis. So if you get a complaint upheld for having an incorrect fact, that result has no bearing on the next matter. They're basically mutually exclusive. Oh yeah, did I mention it's a voluntary organisation?

I have CFS. Most of the time, if i'm actually out of bed and not having some annoying cramp go through me, i sit at my computer. Am i right to assume that, i would be revoked access to my computer? They would send bailiffs around to take it away?  
  
What am i supposed to do if i am feeling like crap and unable to go out, sit in a dark corner and make myself surrender to some kind of punishment that makes me hate myself even more and feel guilty? Guilty of what? Guilty that i hadn't had the chance to be who i wanted to be in life, and just go sit in a dark corner because it's obviously my own fault? What the hell happens if i were to be given money from a relative's savings account? Are they saying that i would be unable to spend it on anything? Oh look it's your birthday, we're going to stop your ESA because your grandparents transferred £50 to your account and we see you purchased a new chair. Really. Is this what it has come too?

true,davidsmeaton,lfc68,,"I'm not the biggest expert or most technically knowledable, but here's my 2p.

Both teams have had a rest, but Utd have a very busy schedule coming up. Utd have to play 5 games in the next 13 days, starting with us. it's going to be busy and while they'll be fresh for our game, Moyes will have that run of games (including Man City and Olympiakos) in his mind. He's also away to West Ham in those games, and the hammers are on a very good run of form.

Utd have their hands full and I think they'll struggle. They've got 3 injured players still. Rafael is just coming off an injury and Fellaini is returning from injury. They'll be banking on Fellaini and Mata. Kawaga is an attacking player but probably won't make it on the pitch because Mata is cup-tied and can't play in CL. Kawaga will fill in for him against Olympiakos. Oh, ferdinand probably won't start either. Roony and RVP will probably start, which is their biggest threat. RVP's form is mediocre but Rooney will be dangerous.

For Liverpool, we have such an attacking side that I think we'll cause their back line massive problems. We need to shut down Fellaini and Mata to dominate midfield. That's where we need Lucas, Hendo and Gerrard to really play out of their skins. We need to hope that Lucas and Sakho are up for such an intense game since both are returning from injury also. Our back line can look frail. If we can get them communicating and deal with crosses, I think we can control the game. I'd like to see Sakho and Agger pair up because I think they're more able to deal with crosses but I think Skrtel's form is better. So it's a tough choice.

I don't use them personally but the people I know who do swear by them.

When I did my GCSEs, I went through the specification for the subject and wrote myself a question relating to each bullet point in a word document. For example, if there was a bullet point in the specification about homeostasis which said that I had to know that water content, ion content, temperature and blood sugar are controlled, I might write ""Name four things which are controlled in homeostasis. How are they controlled?"". Once I had done the whole specification in this way, I would make a copy of the document and go through and answer all of the questions in the new document (using the textbook/internet if I needed it to make sure the answers were exact). At the end of this, I would have a document with just questions, and a document with questions and answers. Then, nearer to exam time, I would go through the question-only document, and try to answer all of the questions off the top of my head. If I struggled with one, I would look it up in the other document to find out the answer. I would make a note of which questions I struggled with, then try those ones again until I learned them. I would then go through the whole set of questions very close to the exam for one final check that I knew everything. Coupled with past papers, this worked for me.

The fact that TFL has a high number of workers, doing jobs that are pointless, is a very bad thing.

Look at the price of commuters tickets, the price of employing all these people is very significant part of that when you take into consideration the pension fund too.

The objection is that for many people, there simply isn't another choice, it's fine for me, I like to cycle and I could do with loosing another couple of kg anyway.  But for people who have a physical job I can appreciate why it's not an option.  Before I started cycling, my travel costs where about £1,800 per year.

This is why people didn't like Crow, they felt that the tube drivers were over paid, doing jobs that aren't needed, at the expense of the Commuter and the tax payer.

However, regardless of your views on the guy everyone has to acknowledge that if you were in the situation of being a tube driver (lucky!) then he was no doubt a great asset on your side for the short term.

true,ggow,null,null," The SNP had about 45% in the Scottish Parliamentary election(44% list, 45 constituency). It was in their manifesto, and it is their raison d'être, to hold a referendum on/achieve independence. Further, a large percentage of the Scottish population are in favour of Independence, though they do not constitute the majority. 

Regarding your protest vote comment, when does a party to from being a party of protest to just securing swing voters? Arguably when they achieve government. The SNP lead a minority government and then increased their share of the vote. There's a degree of capitalising on the dislike of the Westminster based parties and their record but it's not fair to characterise that as a protest vote. 

Additionally, you're also making it seem like the SNP are doing nothing besides campaigning for Independence. That's also manifestly incorrect. Love or hate their policies, they've delivered on a greater proportion of them than any other party. Scotland is doing very well, economically speaking and they've gained a solid reputation for competent governance. Their major people have some of the highest approval ratings of any politicians in the UK and they continue to poll very strongly despite being mid-way through their second parliament in power. 

Basically, you're mischaracterising the support for the SNP but I do agree with your underlying assertion: if the people of Scotland do vote to remain in the union, it will be based on having come to the conclusion that that is where we are better off, not that we're too scared.

Also, it's interesting that grammar schools and public schools have been following this format for a long time - teach/test/teach/test and their students do rather well in life. 

I'm also quite pleased that the government wants to move back to testing over coursework, as we all know how schools cooked the books on that front to cover any cracks in teaching performance.

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"&gt;I would like to see us move for LvG if we legitimately have a shot at him

If Louis van Gaal is available and willing, we should do everything in our power to get him. His managerial record speaks for itself, but for me it is his top to bottom approach that impresses me the most. LvG is a foundational manager who has set the tone for the future for all of his previous clubs. Communication and discipline are two of the most important aspects of his philosophy and for me that is exactly what Spurs need from the top to the bottom. One criticism of AVB is that he largely ignored Tim and the youth squad. Another is how he handled the Ade situation when Ade approached him privately and then before the whole squad. There clearly was not a culture of open communication at the club under AVB. This would never happen under LvG. His philosophy is not to separate and compartmentalize the club, but rather to open it up and streamline it and he does so via communication. The first eleven are as important as the youth and the youth are as important as the first eleven. He tells his players that he expects them to know each others' preferences and their strengths and weaknesses. Each week he opens up meetings so that players can talk and express themselves. To do that the squad must be professional enough and disciplined enough to give and receive criticism. Could the bromance culture that so many have lauded as a sign of squad strength survive such honesty? Communication is one of the keys under LvG and I think it is exceptionally important for the future successes of the club at this time of transition. 

Discipline is definitely something that Spurs need. It appears that once Tim was appointed, one of the first things he attempted to instill into the side was discipline. That that was his first focus should tell us a great deal. Spurs needed it, and needed it bad. Discipline and communication need to be consistent from the top down and I'm not sure that Spurs have it at present. When AVB chose to discipline Ade for his lack of respect and for attempting to undermine his authority, Levy should have supported his decision and backed him up. Levy should not have been whispering in AVB's ear, ""Alright now Andre, hasn't this punishment gone on long enough? Why isn't he in our first eleven right now?"" Though he has played well since returning into the squad, I dislike the clear lack of a culture of discipline at Spurs that the Ade situation revealed. Heck, the discipline issue goes back even to Juande Ramos' days at the club. He was appalled at the lack of a culture of discipline at the club when he first arrived and attempted to remedy the situation as well. That Levy would attempt to undermine AVB's handling of a disciplinary matter clearly suggests such a lack from the top to the bottom and a lack of belief in what the manager is doing. I hear it said on here fairly regularly and it rings true every time; no one player is more important than the club. LvG absolutely buys into that and frankly will not take shit from anybody. If you don't buy into his total approach both on and off the field, then you are expendable. It doesn't matter if you are the best player or the worst. If he comes in and manages Spurs as I hope he does, he needs to be given complete control and discretion. Levy needs to back him completely and a manager of his ilk has earned it. As I said previously, LvG is a foundational manager whose philosophy both on and off the field has set the tone for all of his previous clubs. I don't care if we can get other promising managers such as De Boer for cheaper, we need to do whatever it takes to get LvG to come here. Louis van Gaal is just the sort of manager that Spurs need both on and off the pitch.

Before teaching I worked in engineering and although busy and stressful at times, nothing prepared me for what teaching was like. The time I spend actually in contact with kids during the day is the smallest part of my job. The majority is spreadsheets, SMT meetings, reporting, marking, planning... mostly pointless bureaucracy. I work 11-12 hours every week day and try to keep weekend work down to only Sunday. The holidays are used for marking, actually scrap that, the holidays are usually used for catching up on sleep. By the end of term if you go into a school half the staff are walking round like zombies from six weeks of sleep deprivation. 

I've never been ill enough to be signed off work before, but since teaching I have had two long periods where my body said enough. When this happens, you don't just get a cold, you get the flu or pneumonia. I've been in hospital because of illness - when I worked in private industry I never got ill. 

But... the times I'm in a classroom with the kids I love it. I'm good at it, I have extra responsibility and I make time to do exciting extra curricular to help our kids have new experiences and enjoy their time at school. However, I can't do this for more than another five or so years. My body is literally telling me that I will end up having a breakdown or a heart attack if I stay in teaching much longer. 

It's really sad. The teachers that are leaving in droves are normally good teachers, teachers who can easily get jobs in the private industry because of their skills. We need to keep those teachers but we just can't with the shit that's being thrown by the government. 

When some of us strike later in March the press will be full of people calling us greedy, lazy and ungrateful. I am striking because I want to stay a teacher for as long as possible.

To me, the real problem is that some teachers really aren't that bright themselves these days. I have been in schools as part of my own work where the teacher can't spell properly, they can't speak properly, and the only way they know how to teach is by reading a list as they can't really comprehend anything else. 

The people I know who have entered teaching are not particularly clever - one person who I know who is now the head of science in a primary school has never studied science beyond GCSE and it took him 3 attempts to get a C in GCSE maths. 

Of course, this is largely down to salaries, and if I could, I would have teacher salaries doubled to attract a better calibre of applicant, but unfortunately that's not going to happen. 

I have sometimes thought about teaching myself, and have been told by a number of people 'you'd make a good teacher', but at the end of the day it comes down to money.

After losing 7-1 between Benfica and Chelsea, they need to tighten up defensively and have a more conservative approach, focus more on keeping Arsenal out and then worry about scoring. Sagna or whomever is fielded at rightback for Arsenal needs to be kept from making forward runs, creating 2v1s vs Spurs leftback and not have anytime on the ball when their direct opponent is behind them. Bentaleb will not get as far forward as Townsend and should be able to keep himself between Sagna and Spurs goal effectively and take him out of play more.

In the middle, Dembele holds onto the ball too long in midfield and the further back he plays the more chances that becomes a liability and he coughs the ball up in a bad area. He will also stall out counter attacking possibilities because he looks to dribble and keep possession over hitting a forward pass, he kills momentum from the middle. And his defense isn't as good as Capoue's in tackling, intercepting passes or reading the game.

They need a solid block of four in the middle and need at least one fullback/wide mid pairing to play conservatively to have a chance of slowing Arsenal down, while Lennon, Eriksen and Adebayor can be just enough of a threat to keep Arsenal from throwing everything into Spurs half and Spurs will Adebayor to hold up the ball, Eriksen to try provide creativity during any sustained possession(and a free kick threat) and Lennon provides pace out wide but is also diligent of his defensive duties.

However, these aren't hard problems, they've been solved a lot, even on the DLR (which normally has no driver at all on board, nor anyone who could drive it in an emergency)

The argument is simple.  Some people shop at Waitrose, the staff there are paid more than the ones at Aldi, but Waitrose is a shit load more expensive.  People have a choice.  The tube is often the only mechanism that will allow someone to be at work on time, without adding hours to their journey (take a bus from zone 4 to 1 to arrive at 8:45am!)

&gt;People - especially those with ""proper jobs"", as they see it - resent that someone who (to them) does a much easier job is being paid more than them.

Why would rUK be in favour of the opt out? Ultimately, Scotland ending up in Schengen would drag rUK in. They might talk about passport controls but those would be very bad for business and also very expensive. The cross-border flows in the UK are huge, they massively outweigh journeys from Scotland to the Schengen area. Erecting passport controls at coach stations, the road border and various other locations is going to be problematic. Shifting the rUK-iScotland people from domestic security to international security will probably require renovations at airports.

Your argument about choice is valid, but it's also a much wider argument that doesn't just relate to tube driver wages.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"100% agree.

I have been saying that LvG's biggest asset to Spurs wouldn't the team's on the field performance (though i have no doubt we would win a great deal with him) but his ability to instil a philosophy at the club from the top down. This is something we have been completely missing for years, even before Levy/Lewis/ENIC reached Spurs we had no club ethos, the only thing that we have ever appeared to care about is playing ""attractive, attacking football"". as a fan i love the aggressive attacking football but as a club it has caused us to lurch from manager to manager, style to style with no consistency.  As a club we have been schizophrenic in our approach and that leads to a very difficult situation to build a consistent winning team around.

You see people on Spurs boards espousing the idea that we need a manager to stay with the club for 15 years, that they need to be talented and long tenured to be of use. I have seen people say they don't want LVG because of his age and that at best we could get 3 years out of him and we need someone who can stay for 10 years or longer.  Its a wonderful idea, but an idea that is out of synch of the reality of modern football. Managers don't last 10 years, if they succeed they get chased by other teams, they go looking for a new challenge, they move to manage a national team they look for a change.  Football management is like any other profession in that it is subject to the human nature to look for something more. As a club to create stability a simple ideology can make the reality of modern football easier to cope with.

People look at Wenger and SAF and say ""we need that"" and rightfully so, they have been long tenured and successful. Who wouldn't want that?....but people forget it isn't just SAF or Wenger, the clubs are stable, the clubs are bought into the ideology from the top down, the front office, scouts, youth teams, ticket takers and parking attendants all know the marching orders.  If one of those teams lost a player there wasn't grasp at a player they hoped would fit, they went looking for a player they knew would fit.

Swansea is a great example of a club with an ideology and what it can do.  They are not cash rich. They need to be smart in what they do, for everything they do. They reach this not by managers, but by a top to bottom philosophy. When Martinez left in came Sousa, the philosophy stayed the same but Sousa put his spin on it, when Sousa was out (because he was a bit shit) in came Rodgers and the same thing occurred, then Laudrop and the same happened and now Monk is dutifully toeing the line.  It allows the club to identify managerial candidates quickly, if a player leaves its not a case of scrambling to replace the player with the best available player but finding the best player who fits what the club does as a whole. Its the same approach as Ajax or Barca..the club is bigger than any one man.

LVG shouldn't be viewed as the man who finally lifts us to a championship, he should be viewed as an outside consultant to (forgive the comparison) a company.  His job would be to come in and identify the weaknesses and provide a path to correct the weaknesses
as a long term solution.  If done properly LVG could leave after 3-4 years and we would have a clear view as a club as to what the next step should be to replace him. We could lose a player an not approach replacing him like someone playing Football Manager but rather look to the type of player who fits the system. We could lose someone in the front office, the coaching staff or the training room and know what we need to look for moving forward. 

LVG is the type of manager, the type of influence who's impact could reach well beyond the field and well beyond his tenure.  This is the type of gamble we cannot afford to not take as the upside so greatly outweighs the downside particularly in the long haul.",0,1394889794,null,0,false,0,cg36yq0,t3_20escm,t1_cg36yq0,t1_cg35pyo,null,1432810492,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

The only way to learn Physics and Maths and understand it is to understand the links between different topics: you don't use things in isolation when solving problems but draw on many areas to get through them. As it stands I'd seriously consider teaching, but I wouldn't want to do so currently in Physics because they turned the A Level into pretty much a soft subject such that people not doing Maths can do it, which was a really stupid idea.

Liverpool we lost Sandro early to injury

City we were fucked by the ref 2nd time around, 1st time around was like the Liverpool game, a product of the players being frustrated and desperate because they didn't think they could score enough goals

Our best four defenders with Sandro/Dembele in front of them is more than solid enough. Arsenals weakness is their defence. Get four real solid goal threats on the pitch against them we will cause them problems.

Fluid in attack, solid in defence. That's what we want. I don't hear Liverpool fans complaining about Suarez, Sterling, Sturridge and Coutinho drifting all across the front line.

People with addictions actually can be helped, many people suffer from addictions and many get through them... Also, people with mental health issues are still people, and deserve to be treated as such.

If there are homeless people with mental health issues I want to help them get the care they require.

I've volunteered for various charities before and worked for the council a few times... Trust me love, the council 1. doesn't give a fuck and 2. wouldn't know their arse from their elbow in the first place to be able to start doing something anyone could call a decent effort to help them.

""money can buy time"" ..... your point is? People can also give their time for free, it's even painless!
I want people to understand that doing something for someone else without getting some monetry reward for doing so isn't a bad thing, it doesn't hurt... It actually makes most people feel good about themselves!

I also feel time over money would make people look at charities differently instead of money grabbing organisations and help bring communities together, help people find a new way to socialise and see life in a different light, not to mention bring a lot of people down to earth a bit and stop taking so much for granted.

Care to explain what exact qualifications I'll need to run a charity or organisation seeing as others have been set up by highschool drop outs that didn't even bother going to college?

So far this season our wide forwards haven't supported the striker which mean Eriksens had to stay up the pitch to prevent the striker being isolated.

Eriksen can then drop deeper and pick out passes for the three goal scorers in front of him. 

The reason we looked good when Tim first took over was he played Eriksen from the left but had Ade drift wide allowing Eriksen to tuck in and get involved centrally. With Eriksen and Bentaleb playing the ball out from the back and Ade, Soldado and Lennon to aim at in front we were suddenly really effective going forward. Tims somehow forgotten that though

I specifically said Capoue was the only holding midfielder in that game and said ""Sandro was injured then"" which would imply I was aware Sandro was injured for that game. And he was the only one doing the job of sitting back behind the rest of the midfield, Dembele played in that game but Dembele is not overly effective defending in midfield, some like say, oh I don't know, Sandro would be a better partner for him in the middle.

Both Capoue and Sandro have had trouble keeping themselves from picking up yellow cards from cynical fouls as they have to break up an attack because they don't have any help centrally. This is enough of a problem against big sides to suggest that both should be fielded and sit as the ""2s"" in a 4-2-3-1, not the lone holder in a 4-1-4-1. That's pretty simple, no? If Arsenal plays with a holder and two advanced mids, what's the easiest counter to that? How about two holders to match up against their advanced mids and a center attacking mid, like Eriksen, to matchup against their holder and try to pull him around between the lines and create space in the middle for others.

To answer your other question, because you lack the ability to read and then think before smashing your keyboard with f-bombs, because clearly the way to make your point is to call me a fucking idiot instead of just saying what you want to say, which makes you look like an idiot because again, you can't read so well, I suggested dropping Townsend for Bentaleb. I thought I made this clear enough when I wrote the words: ""Bentaleb will not get as far forward as Townsend and should be able to keep himself between Sagna and Spurs goal effectively and take him out of play more.""

And when I said: ""Bentaleb should be fielded at left midfield"" where as the original poster had suggested fielding Townsend at left midfield. Oh.

I don't see why you object so heavily to placing Adebayor up top with Eriksen in behind and a pacey wide mid on the right as a balance to the more conservative left side? That would provide two outlets when possession is regained, get it to the big guy centrally to hold the ball up or get it to the fast guy in a wide area and move possession forward that way. Moving possession forward and away from your own goal, generally, is a pretty solid way of creating what is known as a counter attack and provides the added benefit of keeping the ball and the other team away from your own net, the one in which you wouldn't want the ball to end up in more than the ball ends up in the other teams net, because usually, that's how you lose.

(The point about money vs. time is a very valid one which all charities face.  Your ""consumers"" typically give one or the other and _time_ is the hardest to receive, especially when it comes to __skilled__ time.

And Spurs attacks may not have looked fluid, but doing things like letting the fullbacks get too far forward, letting the left mid drift inside, playing without a holding midfielder, letting the forwards roam freely disallows defensive organization and leaves the team exposed to other team who is much, much better at attacking.

Spurs have rarely looked solid in defense against top clubs, it took Chelsea 30 seconds to exploit Spurs weakness defensively last Sunday and Liverpool and City have torn them to shreds.

I'm sorry I got a bit defensive in reply to your post, but the USA thing irked me a little and I'm glad you explained why you brought it up, thank you.

The thing about the council however is true... They really do suck, and they really... really don't care. If they even cared about the people that work for them I'd have some hope but those were by far some of the worst jobs I'd ever had. Very cruel place to work in my honest opinion. 

Shelter isn't too bad but they do hound people for money which is just one thing I wouldn't want to be involved in, after seeing how much it irritates people and ofcourse if you're annoying people and making them angry they're less likely to help and more likely to do something to silence you.

I was hoping that if we were to get people to donate money it would be for more direct uses than ""oh, give us all your money and uh... we'll find something to spend it on"" like for example, contact a few cafes ect and see if they would be willing to go ""pending"" and offer meals for homless for ""free"" which have actually been paid for by other customers (who were willing ofcourse, not just tricked into it).

I found a hairdresser who would be willing to give the homeless haircuts ect to make them look more presentable for a job interview or something and I was speaking to a laundrette who said she'd think about letting the homeless wash their clothes for free so they can have clean clothes for interviews and in general.

I've only spoke to one company (secretary, but she said she'd get her boss to call me) about printed shirts/jumpers with company logos on them for the homeless to wear, so their company is getting advertising and the company only has to pay for the shirt/jumper and a little money to the homeless person for wearing it (kind of like those two uni guys that rented their face to companies, if you remember?) I was planning on contacting more companies with the same idea.


I was also speaking to a friend of mine (who is a vet nurse in training) about possibly having her or someone she knows who is good in her class and willing to come out with us, and give any homeless peoples pets a little check up and see if they're ok, and if not then help get the pet medical care too, since the homeless person would be able to get help from the RSPCA.

The main donations I'd be hoping for would be like, a little care package that I've wrote up a list of things to include in a little bag (toothbrush, toothpaste, blah blah) or time helping make them up and handing them out to people.

Other than that people willing to give time could maybe even become a friend with a homeless person and help them find AA meetings ect to help them overcome their addictions, but this part I realise is probably just wishful thinking.

And plus, regardless of whether Sammy's going to give a good performance or a poor one (which is so unpredictable), I think the team suffers with him in the side. Izaguirre is massively less effective with Samaras on the left wing. Big Georgios likes to take his time, meander about the pitch and tries to beat players on his own when he should pass. He can certainly be effective but is not at all compatible with the style of Izzy, who likes to pass, make driving runs and whip balls into the box.

For me, Sammy's lack of minutes on the pitch this season is a large part of why Izaguirre has finally regained the dazzling form and confidence he displayed before his ankle break. Back to his best, Izzy is such an essential part to our creativity and forward play. He's currently provided the most assists in the SPFL this season, so Izzy's effectiveness is a lot to give up to shoehorn Sammy into the team.",0,1394896218,null,0,false,0,cg38o71,t3_20hahy,t1_cg38o71,t1_cg37lj0,null,1432811297,6,false,Glasgow_Celtic,t5_2rgo4,6

Midnight came to mind first, but that episode is way scarier *because* you don't see the monster, so that's probably a bad choice.

What does 'the system' or 'the man' do, which you seem to think all teachers should ignore?

Well for on it establishes and defines the job we do when we are trained: I feel I must follow the rules, because my boss, and everyone up the food chain, tell me so. 

The only person in my school who ignores those edicts was trained somewhere else, he has the experience and confidence to know he can get a better job at any time, and he is easily the best teacher.

It is naive to say teachers should ignore a system that educates, trains and pays them, it takes a special confidence to ignore that. And even then, what if a class fails when you were not teaching as the system dictates? Nothing good.

As for pay, are you Tom Clancy? (Seriously some of his books lay his ideology on thick, apparently if you take an underpaying government job you are either incompetent or incredibly wealthy /end rant). You male a fair point but ultimately teaching jobs are likely to be always to be not brilliantly paid, but teachers are reasonably well off (apparently, please don't shoot me).

true,ultra_22,null,null,"Yes, but Arsenal/Chelsea/Liverpool fans based in London get the chance to watch their team plenty of times in and around London. There are, currently, SIX chances for a London-based Liverpool fan to go watch a match in the away section of a stadium.

For Benfica fans based in London, this is a once-in-every-few-years chance to watch the team they support. Or not even that because the last time Benfica came to London was vs Chelsea a few seasons ago, and before then I can't even remember a time.

Being a Benfica fan based in London myself, I have to admit I got tickets for the home section as soon as they went on general sale. I got it through the Tottenham website so I didn't go through some shady website to buy them.

During the match, I didn't bother anyone, I merely watched. Occassionally clapping along with the Spurs fans around me to get involved in the fun.

I didn't celebrate effusively when Benfica scored, and I applauded Eriksen's nicely taken freekick. Even my clothes were just what I had been wearing during that day, I didn't have a single bit of red on me. 

All in all, all I wanted to say is, this was an amazing chance for me to go watch the team I support for the first time in over 15 years, considering I'm only 23, I can barely even remember the last time I went to watch a match (can you imagine supporting Tottenham but not watching them live for that long, and then suddenly you get that ONE chance?).

I understand you might have been annoyed about the atmosphere, but I don't see how that was the fault of the Benfica fans. There were about 10 empty seats on the row I was sitting on and the Spurs supporters around me were constantly complaining about the way Spurs were playing.

If anything, the reason the atmosphere was lacking was not because of the Benfica fans, but because of the Benfica players, because as soon as Erikson scored that goal, the place erupted. I could not even hear the Benfica section at all. But very quickly Tottenham were slowed down by Benfica again and everyone went quiet.

I think the Barbican is great, and the failure of those estates involve a load of factors including poor upkeep and the terrible results of shoving only the poorest of society into them. But mostly they all looked terrible even when new and nobody cared enough to fix their problems and make them better. 

The houses we're building today are very rarely beautiful. More often than not they're as badly thought out as the things built in the 80s. Personally I'd prefer we built good houses that also looked good. I don't think that's too much to ask.

I haven't been doing that work the past couple of months, but they still take the £12 a week. When I phoned up to ask how I could go about having my payments re-assessed, they told me the person I sign on with has to request this happen via email.

I signed on and got told it was nothing to do with them, I had to phone up. I went downstairs to use the Jobcentre phones to give the benefits line a call, and discover that every phone has been removed from every Jobcentre in the country.

These phones had no outside line and could ONLY be used for phoning the benefits departments. They now expect people living on next to nothing (£60 a week in my case) to phone an 0845 number to discuss their benefits, on their home phone lines at their own expense.

They gave me a form to fill out regarding my payments, and I explained that I was disabled and unable to stand to fill it out, and asked where I could sit to do so. They told me nowhere, that I'd have to go into town to do it and bring it back.

Eventually I went to a work programme provider and they let me use one of their phones. And the form turned out to be unnecessary anyway. Apparently I have to write a letter to yet another department requesting they re-assess me, which will likely take several weeks.

It is all - literally - insane.

If the problem is the level at which we export compared to which we import then it is a balance of trade problem - not a problem with the size of the public sector. 

E.g. Deutsche Bahn the publicly owned German train company are selling train services in the UK

E.g. EON the publicly owned french power generation company are profiting by selling electricity in the UK 

Before BP was privatised it exported oil all over the world.

If the problem you are talking about is that we spend more than we raise in tax then it is a problem of a fiscal deficit and not a dependency on the public sector. The problem is however that we are very much economically still part of the UK and politicians in NI only have  limited control over the NI economy.

Just like Fermanagh has a fiscal deficit compared to Belfast, NI has a fiscal deficit compared to London. It is unlikely that this will ever change because of how wealth and economic activity becomes concentrated.

The lack of time with customers is a constant complaint in the morning meetings there, with some staff getting quite impassioned and angry about it.  I've been thinking about writing an essay of sorts about the experience.

Quite often people were sent to me with orders to ""get this done today, right now, or you'll be sanctioned.""  These people were mostly the kind who hadn't been bothering to help themselves.  The vast majority of customers I saw were just those who needed help with using the Internet and such.

I hear Cazorla and Rosicky have been good lately, and Flamini is a good player, but we are looking at a severely reduced Arsenal.


Apparently these Mertesacker and Koscielny characters have been pretty good, so we may struggle to score. Let's see how well they do when faced with our Dane. I'd start Townsend on the left, just to wear out Bacary Sagna. Lennon on the right. Ade. Erikson gets license to roam. For subs, I'd consider taking Lennon off and replacing him with Siggy, shifting Townsend over to the right and therfore completely altering the shape of our attack. Let's see if Sagna can cope with Thor once Andros has run the legs off him.

What you don't seem to understand is that land borders suck if you need to use a passport to cross them. If Scotland gets forced into Schengen there will be popular support for entering the Schengen area in rUK. It may be politically toxic now but if they needed to invest in all the infrastructure and put up with all the hassle of crossing in to Scotland, a compromise would be necessary. The only alternative is joining Schengen. Knowing this, it's likely rUK and Ireland would be heavily in favour of helping Scotland secure an opt out. 

It's funny that you accuse me if hand waving, the political consequences are obvious and I'm just mapping out a likely outcome.

What's your background in community outreach? Training in first aid? Experience with handling finance and donations? 

You are quick to blame other organisations in Edinburgh, The Council mya have its problems but they have huge resources and staff dedicated to helping homeless people in Edinburgh and I have seen first hand the good work that they do.

&gt;don't feel like you're achieving anything and when you find out where most of the money actually goes you lose faith in them..

Where was this? These charities don't run at a profit, Bethany Christian Trust and the SA are not like this in my experience. 

&gt;printed shirts/jumpers with company logos on them for the homeless to wear, so their company is getting advertising and the company only has to pay for the shirt/jumper and a little money to the homeless person for wearing it

I genuinely cant tell if you are serious by this comment. 

Edinburgh does not need another charity. IMO  you seem to be more interested in the whole ""I have set up and run a charity"" aspect than the actual helping homeless people aspect.

If you genuinely want to help homeless people, contact Bethany Christian Trust, or contact the Council's Volunteer service to find out where your handwork would be best valued. They can put you in contact with organisations they know do good work.  

This will be the best use of your time and resources and the best way for you to make a difference.

That's a lot of additional voters who don't ordinarily vote - and they disproportionately comprise of individuals in the C2DE socio-economic bracket and those in the under-35 age group. Who also happen to be the groups where support for independence runs highest in polling.

The fundamental problem with all the polling that's conducted is it tends to over-emphasise those in the higher socio-economic groups and those over the age of 35. For most votes that isn't a problem as they're the groups that tend to vote. But it means a lot of the polling for the referendum is potentially failing to give an accurate indicator because this isn't just another election and people are going to vote who wouldn't ordinarily. 

People are going to vote even if they've never voted in their lives and normally don't give a shit about politics, and that group tends to swing pretty heavily pro-independence. Apparently, a recent poll in the Daily Record put it at 45% yes, 55% no on the question ""If the referendum were helf tomorrow, how would you vote?"" and that poll had the same issues as most of the polls in terms of who was polled i.e. people who tended to vote in normal elections.

One speedtest result is meaningless - speedtest.net really does sometimes provide anomalous results - I've had upload results way above 20Mbit, which is totally impossible when I can see that my modem is synced at 20000kbps. If you can show continous throughput over 80Mbps then that'd be something.

Lucas - He's had a few great games for us and a few games where he is not so prolific. I personally love the way how he breaks up plays. But he does have off-games a few times but was never a burden to us on the pitch, IMO.

I am the eternal optimist, or so I thought. However, today has really made me realise that we are at risk of getting relegated. If there are not drastic changes in *something* very quickly, we will get relegated.

That being said, the amount of fans left in the stands at around the 89th minute makes me think that perhaps we deserve it.

You originally said it first, which I disputed, and then I disputed the speedtest result.

&gt; It might be worth noting that the 92Mbps was in the first week of my plusnet contract, so there may have been some negotiating / training going on - it can take 2 weeks to settle down, I gather. I don't make a point of checking the speed regularly unless there are noticeable problems.

It might settle down or change, but even on the first ever connection it absolutely will not connect above 80000 - it might go up or down but it won't exceed that. If you can check the stats on the modem (which you can't unless you hack the modem, or use a router that can somehow extract it like the BT hubs) it is probably showing 80000 as you say you have a very short line. That's why I think your 90Mbit result is an anomaly.

http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/3373056640 is what I'm getting, I guess there are people using it so it's not 100%.

Lloris

Walker - Kaboul - Vert - Rose

Sandro - Mousa/Bentaleb/Capoue

Lennon(Townsend) - Eriksen - Chadli

Ade

Our back line is pretty easy.  If Walker did pick up a knock Thursday, then Naughton in.  

Sandro needs to start.  As for who starts with him, I really don't know.  Mousa might not be fit, but if he is I think I'd go that route.  If not, Bentaleb or Capoue.  I would go for Bentaleb, but Capoue makes just as much sense.

I've been calling for Chadli on the left for about a month.  Probably won't happen, but I hope it does.  Lennon on the right is because honestly, I don't think we have a better option.  Chadli could be worth a run out there, same for Townsend.  Honestly, any combination of those three that doesn't involve Azza on the left is cool.

I really think we need three men in the midfield.  Two strikers against Arsenal isn't something anyone should be comfortable with.  Eriksen in the hole and Ade doing his thing.

I honestly think we can win.  We're at home, and it's the biggest match of our season.  2-1 Spurs, goals from Chadli and Ade for us, Mertesacker on a corner for Arsenal.

They've got some injuries right now, so how they're going to set up isn't *really* all that clear.

It is relatively difficult to get a named RF and often people do multiple PDRFs and then move to lecturer (although many more move out of academia after a postdoc or two).

~~------------ Lloris  
Walker Kaboul Vertonghen Fryers  
Townsend Sandro Moussa Rose  
------------ Eriksen  
----------- Adebayor~~  
------------ Lloris  
Walker Kaboul Vertonghen Rose  
Townsend Sandro Moussa Chadli  
------------ Eriksen  
----------- Adebayor  

But this is what I assume most fans want to see, based on comments from this sub:

----------- Lloris  
Walker Kaboul Vertonghen Rose  
------- Sandro Moussa  
Lennon --- Eriksen --- Townsend  
---------- Adebayor

However, this is what Timmy'll probably play (though god knows this one is impossible to predict):

----------- Lloris  
Walker Kaboul Vertonghen Rose  
----------- Sandro  
Andros Bentaleb Moussa Eriksen  
------------- Ade

Really I'd be fine with any of the above line-ups. As for scoreline prediction: 3-1 us, book it. COYS.

EDIT: I forgot to put my Arsenal line-up. Given that they're also in injury hell, their line-up is fairly straightforward IMO, though Podolski might feature:

--------- Szczesny  
Sagna Merte Koscielny Monreal  
------- Arteta Flamini  
--- Oxlade Rosicky Cazorla  
---------- Giroud

I think we can take em. It's time to kick ass and beat Arsenal - *and we're all out of ass*.

Also, for what it's worth, whoscored.com has my predicted Timmy formation (433/4141) as their prediction too, but with Siggy on for Eriksen, Lennon for Townsend, and Paulinho for Moussa. I think any of those subs could happen, as they're all fairly like for like, and changes in fitness might make some players available/unavailable.

**Javi Garcia**- has began to complete his 180 and turn around into a really solid player. I honestly thought we where in for  a drubbing when Kompany got sent off and we where left with a pairing of Garcia and Demichelis but the he held his own.


**Samir Nasri**- Ive said this before but this guy is really giving 110% for the team, this is the aggilionth game in a row ive seen him track back essentially the lenght of the field to help out the defence-should be noted Dzeko's been doing this too latley

**David Silva**- a superb world class goal and a superb assist, nuff said.

**Gael Clichy**- was expecting a pretty average performance in line with the performances he's been putting in this season but he seemed like a man with something to prove today; great tackling and marking, and surging runs, unlucky not to get an assist.

All in all great spirit from the team

Because I'm willing to bet it hasn't.

I was agreeing with him until this bit at the end. BBC3 is pretty poor now but it did used to produce some great shows in the past, particularly in the mid 2000s when we had stuff like Monkey Dust, Little Britain, Torchwood, and Gavin and Stacey.

I do however think he's right that the brand has since been tarnished by an over-reliance on cheap reality shows about drunk teenagers and non-stop Family Guy repeats.

**Still signing on while you were there?**

Yup.  I was expected to do as much jobseeking as possible while working (it was full-time, or as near as makes no difference).  Obviously my advisor understood that I wouldn't be able to look as much as usual while at the placement, and my actual signing time was flexible since I was there all day.

**How did you get the placement?**

My advisor asked me one day if I'd be interested and I said yes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Less of a profile and more a sort of calculated political audit of where Benn stood relative to Hitchens' politics at that time. Couple of points:

*  the ANL, anti-nazi league, were a much more successful forerunner of Unite Against Fascism. Organised largely by the Socialist Workers Party, with some Labour figures like Peter Hain, they advocated physical confrontation of the far-right National Front on the streets (hence Hitchens referring to them as less ""respectable""). The associated organisation Rock Against Racism is better remembered due to backing from the Clash, Specials etc. and the NME.

* Although the Hitches' crystal ball correctly predicted the result of Benn's bid for Labour leader, but he has no inkling at this point (as few did) to the extent Thatcherism would go on to change the face of UK politics and society, although he correctly identifies the confrontation. 

* Note how the political positions from which Hitchens is assessing Benn (class struggle feminism, Republicanism, street anti-fascism, industrial democracy, anti-police, anti-military). The idea of a Labour politician advocating any combination of those positions today puts them easily on the very far-left fringe. Again, a testament both to the political culture of the later 70s/early 80s and to the transformation of Thatcherism.

* It's interesting to revisit the extent to which British state power as unleashed in Northern Ireland has been or is being brought back to the mainland - thinking here of the now notorious 'spycops' scandal, and current debates around watercannon/rubber bullets.

MOTM - Azpilicueta. Reads the game amazingly, makes excellent descisions. Shout out to Matic who was great too. 


Ramires WTF?

KTBFFH


EDIT: after giving it a thought, this game should motivate the team to put in a final effort before the season ends. We got everything in our hands to do it. The league being so unpredictable, I think City will slip up more than once in those last 11 games. I believe we have it in our team to do it (win every game from now on). 


It will also be interesting to see how the midfield works out in the CL (Matic cup tied). But I won't be dissapointed if we fail to win anything this season, I'm trusting Jose on the 'small horse' comparisons he has been using. He won the treble with Inter in his third season there! 


also like Chelsea being the dark horse in the CL, there are not many who think we will reach the final or even semis. I think we can beat any of the remaining sides with our back four healthy and an in-form Hazard.

And you know this how? Everyone I know from the continent sees the removal of border checks as one of the most useful things ever to happen from the EU. They're am expensive to run hassle. The support wouldn't be immediate but it certainly would build. We're both well developed nations with high cross border flows, there's a large amount of cross border shipping. There will be a large and vocal number of people calling for the removal of the checks. Those people don't exist now because the cross border traffic in the UK is mostly via means of transport that we don't mind being passport checked at. 

Your problem here is that you're trying to extrapolate from current positions as opposed to considering how fundamentally the situation will be altered by a yes vote and Erecting the Borders. 

&gt; calling everyone who disagrees with you a moron. 

I've only called you a moron. Either your statement is false or everyone agrees with me.

As to hand waiving, the Tories are not going to pursue a spiteful foreign policy. It doesn't win points. Border checks at Scotland is not a vote winning policy unless England somehow becomes radically racist against the Scots. That's not going to happen. Erecting Borders after a yes vote doesn't even make sense with a different immigration policy, let alone without. If the objective is to increase Scotland's population, what does it matter? No one is proposing scrapping border controls and immigration policy is mostly unrelated to that.

I don't think the BBC needs to be paying for low-brow reality TV, or endless repeats of Family Guy - the commercial sector can (and does) do that.

Same with shows like Torchwood - they'll be made with or without BBC3 because they are worth it.

Regarding comedy, perhaps this will mean they'll replace some of the terrible new 'comedies' on BBC1 with some of the better stuff that previously got its break on BBC3. Fingers crossed.

I don't think this is the same as 6Music, which provides something not available elsewhere. That was worth fighting for.

Just tired of seeing Chelsea do everything but score for the past few years. Either we play like champions or we are woeful at putting the ball in the back of the net. The latter puts massive pressure on Cech and the back line to shut up shop for a tight 1-0 win. Our squad and play gets really unbalanced because our defense has to do more work than a lot of others because everyone knows we have to get a clean sheet in order to have any chance of winning. While we are miles ahead in the talent department, against the majority of the league every now and again we get games like this. The opposition scores one goal and holds on to win. A team of our quality shouldn't be losing to Villa, no disrespect to Villa, because teams of our stature know how to score goals. If we think we are of the level of Madrid, Barca and Munich, then we shouldn't be struggling for 90+ minutes to get a goal against a side in a relegation fight. I know that every now and again we might drop points and lose to lower sides because it isn't our day or a fantastic display from the goalie, but that is different from today's game.

Everyone is happy about how we won, but no one talks about how we always shoot ourselves in the foot because we can't score consistently with a striker. Chelsea attack as a team and defend as a team, you can't have 10 men doing the work of 11 in our current system. We need Hazard to play like Suarez/Aguero and Bale from last year, in order to look menacing going forward because he is often doing the work of two people, his own work and the striker. Torres and Eto'o aren't strikers in our systems, they don't often look the goal threat. Torres runs all day because he doesn't have his shooting boots on. All he does is make runs, drag the centerbacks around and make them tired so Hazard, Oscar and whoever the third attacking player is can run inside, link up and score goals. Eto'o links up with the three behind him and acts like a fourth attacking midfielder, not a striker. He isn't a target man, he often doesn't make runs behind and doesn't play off the shoulder of the last man. He drops deep to link up and play with the attacking three. This is nice and all but with a hole in the center of the park, who is going to fill that space? Hazard cutting inside and the amoeba shape of our attacking three. By three people filling the space meant for one, teams sit back and clog the middle in order to stop the runs of Oscar, Hazard and Willian. This is part of the reason why when we score it is a top drawer finish because it takes something truly special in order to evade the legs and tackles of 4 to 5 players.
I won't go down the rabbit hole of who Chelsea might get fill that hole, as its a pointless conversation, but its incredibly frustrating to watch our players do everything but put the ball in the back of the net",1,1394915417,null,0,false,0,cg3fxdg,t3_20i005,t1_cg3fxdg,t3_20i005,null,1432814787,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

I'm a dog person. I've only ever met one cat that I could even remotely stand. I also refuse to own a dog whilst not living in the countryside. Taking them for walks and all that bollocks makes ownership a chore rather than a joy.

My point may have been snide but it sounds like you *can* get rid of them, you just don't want to. That's fine! **I'm not suggesting you should want to**.
There's consequences to that decision though, just like any other.

By the sound of it your problem stems from having a lot of animals in a dwelling designed primarily for humans. Unsurprisingly this results in it smelling like a house with too many pets. How can I put this... Four cats is a lot. Six is mental. I've never been in a house that isn't a stately home that would be large enough for that many.

Essentially either do something about the number of pets or get used to the fact that a round the clock cleaning regime is going to be needed. I once new a guy with two enormous dogs in a little house in the suburbs. It may have only been two but for the size of dwelling the whole place stank of dogs. As I said, I'm a dog person, that doesn't change the fact that a strong smell of dogs makes the place smell like a kennel rather than a household with a pet.

Back in the 80's teachers had scope to teach what they thought was adequate and what they thought was relevant to a quite narrow national specification, test the pupils if and when they wanted to and if the kids they had were not interested the teacher was not sacked or the school punished for ""failing little Johnny"" (Of course there are some cases where the school is failing, but that is the minority) Now teachers simply teach answers that come from the mark scheme, if the inspectors catch them teaching something off spec. or not inside the current popular teaching ""strategy"" (personal white boards at the desks anyone?)

true,BrambleBees,wales-denbighshire,Denbighshire,"Hmmm ... story....

Well my *best* story is that I met a woman there (another volunteer) who was a lot of fun and I hope to see much more of her :p.  But I assume you meant stories relating to the work or the customers?

As boring as it sounds, nothing much exciting happened while I was there.  I hear about assaults and all sorts occurring in jobcentres all the time, but not a single event of the sort took place during my two months there.

There was one customer complaint.  Not about me, but I had worked with her and I took the phone call.  She felt she'd been mistreated by the security personnel during her visit, so called to complain, and as a matter of procedure was asked about each individual interaction she'd had, probably so they could assess the quality of service from as many angles as possible.  They're very big on customer service in this particular centre.

Apparently I received a glowing review, while everyone else was thrown under the bus.  That was my third or fourth day.  The advisor who'd taken the complaint came over afterwards to ask if I was okay, presumably fearing I may have suffered some emotional anguish.  (Un)Luckily I've worked in retail, so I've seen everything they're likely to get at the Jobcentre, and probably worse! so I'm not phased by an unhappy customer.

Other than that, there were no real events.  Some customers were less happy than others, but none were aggressive or abusive.  I spent a good amount of time chatting and laughing with fellow volunteers, and generally just did the work and went home afterwards.

Oh and one guy tried to claim his Universal Jobmatch account wasn't working because the password wasn't being accepted.  The reason it wasn't working is because he'd stuck a 3 on the end of the password I'd written down for him so that he could *make* it not work.  As in he'd written a 3 on the slip of paper I'd given him.  I don't think he'd counted on seeing me again, so figured nobody would know any better.  A perfect example of the totally transparent IT excuses that I mentioned.  It stuck in my mind because it was such an obvious lie, and he was one of the sort who clearly had no intention of seeking work.",0,1394916429,null,0,1395424789,0,cg3gbmc,t3_20hx9d,t1_cg3gbmc,t1_cg3dzmw,null,1432814973,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28

Rodgers seems to use two ""phases"" of pressing: 1) intensely, team-wide, immediately upon losing possession, 2) closing down opposing players quickly as they receive the ball, preventing time to compose a further pass. The second happens mainly in midfield, and appears aimed to prevent that midfielder turning and playing an onward pass. The goal of Rodgers' midfield pressing seems to be to prevent that opposing midfielder turning at all, forcing them to pass back into their own defense...where Suarez, Sterling, and Sturridge do a very good job of closing the defenders down.

Regardless of that, though, I really admire the way that Rodgers has taken a Spanish/Barca style of pressing and adapted it to the English game, using the qualities of a stereotypical ""British"" style (high-energy)  and blending it with technical skill and tactics. You see it in players like Henderson and Allen, who combine high-energy pressing with deepening understanding and use of rotational midfielders (for example), and Coutinho, who has bundles of skill and has now built up magnificent stamina and upper body strength.

If you don't move, certainly you should not celebrate or jump up of we score/win. Not because of fear of getting abused/punched/kicked, but because it is wholly inappropriate. You are in their section, give them respect.

We definitely need more targets up front, and so a kind of 4-2-1-3 when we're in our attacking phase is a good idea.

It's an interesting question ""what will I do for NI"" because I don't think its right to see the interests of N. Ireland in isolation from the wider interests of Europe and beyond. We are all so connected that our fate is dependent on that of others. Of course I will work hard to ensure NI gets the best deal from Europe and work hard to maximise the benefit of being part of the EU by drawing down available funds etc. But it is crucial that rather than taking a strictly competitive attitude to Brussels asking what can we get out of this that I will work for the betterment of everyone in Europe. I think the Greens in Europe are unique in that respect in Europe in that we actually work so collaboratively as a party and are opposed to the concept of nationalism- we actually believe in in solidarity and rather than attempting to undermine the whole EU project. We want to make it work. Only at a European level can we tackle many issues inc. international tax avoidance and evasion - and excessive wealth accumulation, climate change &amp; energy security, overfishing and race to the bottom social and economic policies. I want to see the real injustices of extreme poverty and environmental destruction tackled in this world and Europe is the best place to do this. I think you will find that much more could be achieved for NI and indeed the whole of Europe if our representatives took such an approach. We need to stop asking our MEPs what can you get for us and start asking them what are they contributing to make the world a better place.

true,BrambleBees,wales-denbighshire,Denbighshire,"Regarding what you said about unions: they probably get away with it because they're calling it work experience.  I've been using the word volunteer because that's how it was initially sold to me, but most of the others were a fair bit younger so the phrase work experience is probably more applicable.

In my Jobcentre at least, all but one of the phones that were for the use of customers have been physically removed, with the remaining one being reserved for emergency calls (emergencies relating to benefits, that is, so presumably things like ""I'm about to be homeless"").  I thought this was the case everywhere but apparently it isn't.

Yes, use of Universal Jobmatch is mandatory, but it's *not* currently mandatory to allow your advisor to monitor your activity, so it's not really enforceable.  Some advisors are very pushy about it, though, and they don't necessarily always tell the customers that it's optional.  Only a matter of time until it is forced, though, unless someone with the power to change it wakes up and realizes how awful it is.  I quite like some of it in principle, but making it mandatory when it's clearly so inadequate is absolutely ridiculous.  Not to mention making it mandatory for people who have severely restricted access to IT or who cannot be expected to use a computer even if they have one.  For example, some of my customers were unable to read, and some were recently out of prison and not *allowed* to use a computer.

When I say UJ I mean Universal Jobmatch.  I think you thought I was talking about Universal Credit?  No, I'm not in a pilot area for that, as far as I know.  I didn't really deal with actual benefits in any major way.  I gave a little general advice where I happened to know the answers, but I haven't had any training for that so I typically told people they'd need to ask their advisor.

&gt; I believe in situations such as these they would move you to the Liverpool section or some neutral, press/scout section.

I really, really doubt they'd reseat you. Telling the stewards you're in the wrong area is about as much use as telling them that you think you might have been scammed and your ticket might be counterfeit. They have no requirement whatsoever to do anything other than kick you out of the ground if they think you'll cause trouble. 

I know people to have been kicked out of Old Trafford before for not being in the right section - why would the stewards treat you any differently just because you go to them first? Aside from the fact that almost all the stewards will be Man Utd fans themselves, it'd be a huge hassle for them to personally escort you out the section and find a spare neutral/away seat for you somewhere compared to just kicking you out.

I'd like to share my story of when i was on JSA and what my perspective was.

About 3 years ago having left high school i started claiming JSA. In total, I was claiming for about a year when there was an incident. 

When you go to the jobcenter a random member of staff just picks out a card with customer details on and collects the information onto the computer. They then call you over and check that you have filled out your diary and applied for the relevant jobs, especially the ones they assigned to you. -This is where ""Tim"" comes in.

Tim was a tattooed, bald fellow who worked there, a down to earth like-able guy who was straight forward and didn't put up with as much as the others. So one week I go in and I think everything is normal. Sit down at Tim's table this time and he asks me the standard questions when he gets to ""Did you apply for this job?"". I said ""no, i don't think so"" and as he questioned me i didn't have a good enough answer. I had 2 weeks to apply for 1 or 2 jobs that i agreed to beforehand and i didn't even do that.

At that moment Tim opened up on me and all the staff and customers looked on as he verbally mashed me to a pulp. I got the whole 9 yards of ""what are you going to do with your life?, do you still live with your mum? You've lost your benefits now."" Then i had to go through some sort of appeal process and fill out a form stating why i did not apply for said job while Tim saw to all the good kids.

A few days later after i escape i'm sat in my room contemplating my existing and trying to motivate myself deep within and my brother comes in and says ""I have got you a job at Morrison's (Where he works)."" Sure enough I apply and a few weeks later i'm working their and the job center actually gave me £100 just for finding a job. 

I've been working their ever since and started and completed a college course in Music along side working part time at the big 'M'.

So i was one of those leeches that we all love to bash on and it took a friend or kindness from another to pull me out and become a more useful person.

Unfortunately there is always an element of risk involved in buying a motorbike or anything mechanical and if you don't know exactly what you are looking for then take someone to look at a private sale bike for sure.

You'll find many guides on the internet with checklists of things to check when viewing a bike start with these to familiarise yourself with what to look for, and ALWAYS do them all - even at a dealers!

Another thing to check is the owner. Talk to them, get a feel for the type of person they are. Are they a bit of a scallywag? likely to have overly thrashed / wheelied your potential new bike? Has it had loads of previous owners? Does that mean that there is an issue with the bike?!

Have they serviced it at a dealers or done it themselves? If they have done it themselves do they seem mechanically minded? Do they have a workshop in the garage, or just a shoddy toolbox -are loads of bolts rounded off etc.

It's about having the right people no matter who they are or where they're from and the fact that this is being discussed suggests that quite a few people believe that we don't have the right people in charge and that it's no coincidence that most of the top tories are from eton.

Defoe was brilliant. I didn't expect much from either the team or Defoe going in given this is the first game of the season and 8/11 starters are new to the squad. We actually only had about 30% possession all game but all it took was two quick counters and Defoe finished on both.

Both goals came from strong play in the midfield. The first, Toronto native Osorio made a nice move to cut around a defender and placed a great ball into Defoe's path, who was cutting between two defenders directly to the goal. On the second, Michael Bradley put enough pressure on the Seattle player to cause the turnover, and Defoe did the rest with two defenders back but neither in good position. He looked like he was playing alone out there, clinical finish.

He didn't really see much of the ball for the rest of the game, and that's all we needed as we managed to hang on for the 2-1 win.

Toronto won 6 games last season. We almost lost this one. I think it will take our team a few months to really get into any groove but Defoe alone will be a reason why we win a few games that we shouldn't.

No, I don't think so.  I spent two months getting to know many of them pretty well, and some of them have no sympathy whatsoever for their customers.  They may well be perfectly pleasant people most of the time (they were perfectly friendly with me), but I imagine they've become quite desensitized over the years.  Assaults like the ones you mention are extremely rare where I worked.  Even a raised voice is a noteworthy event, so I don't think the advisors here have had the same experience as your friend.

Anyway, the advisors I describe this way are certainly a very small minority.  I probably shouldn't have used the word 'many'.  Two or three at most out of the 30-odd.  The vast majority do the best they can with the very limited time and resources that they have.

Must they go from dogma riddled religion to dogma riddled ideology?

The other Abrahamistic religions show a blithe disregard for many of the more ridiculous or harmful doctrines. 

Is it because Muslims are typically from more backwards cultures where religion is taken far more seriously than basic human decency, and in fact it's got nothing to do with being a Muslim, and all to do with being from backwards cultures? 

And in fact is it not the case that first and second and third generation immigrants from the third world are in fact still being assimilated into British culture and it's a simple fact that they're disproportionately Muslim religiously so it's simply inevitable that oppressed women are more likely to be Muslim than other religions?

So I say the message should not single out religions or genders and should simply be for people to reject their gender stereotypes and discard any parts of religion that reinforce them. The message doesn't need to be different for men as it is for women, it should simply be to treat each other as people, not based on gender.",1,1394930095,null,0,false,0,cg3lg1b,t3_20hxug,t1_cg3lg1b,t3_20hxug,null,1435546173,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Just out of interest, what are you looking to study?

With the museum I would definitely recommend doing a full stadium tour the day before the match, gets you into the museum and you see everything, better not to do it on match day as it's a couple of quid cheaper and you get to see the players entrance and all of the dressing rooms! The museum is also very good, whilst obviously LFC orientated, it's got some really interesting stuff in there for any football fan, but if you're going to get to Anfield the day before, you might as well go full hog and do the tour, they're both well worth it! I'd also recommend popping into the boot room cafe afterwards, literally right next to the museum and it's good food, good service and a nice atmosphere! A taxi from the city centre to Anfield is about £5-£6 or the number 26 bus from Liverpool One will drop you straight outside the stadium for a couple of quid each! Be warned though, there's not much around the stadium itself, but worth visiting and paying respects at the Hillsborough memorial!

As for the rest of the city, there's the Liverpool One shopping in the city centre, which is very good, all sorts of shops and a nice environment really! There's the Cavern club where the Beatles used to play in the centre as well as lots of museums and other tourist attractions! The Albert Dock is well worth the visit too, the Beatles museum is good, but expensive, but the Maritime museum on the docks is fantastic, free entry and really good stuff to see, especially the international slavery museum, really interesting!

There are more effective charities with funding and experts that need volunteers in Edinburgh now! You may dismiss them but from the Salvation Army to Bethany Christian Church, to soup kitchens and food banks these are good, effective charities.

-&gt; I haven't worked in a soup kitchen, so that would be something to try, but I have worked with a few other charities, I hope you understand that for certain reasons I don't want to name them though, sorry

You're 20 years old. What do you know about addiction and recovery? What do you know about mental health disorders? about schizophrenia?

-&gt; My age doesn't have any effects on my experiences with mental disorders and addiction... I have vast personal experience with people suffering with mental disorders and I care for my mother at home who suffers from schizophrenia, and I helped my dad overcome his alcoholism.

What contacts do you have in the police, social services, NHS, hostels, temporary accommodation, housing associations and the Council?

-&gt; I have family who are police officers and CSO's, I know one person in the social services though she deals with children mainly, I don't know anyone currently working for the NHS as my friend is still in uni training, hostels I have little experience with but that can be gained, temp accomodation same as hostels but could possible also be gained, fair with housing associations and the council as I've said to other people I used to work for and really my faith in them is minimal...

Not to whine but the council really needs some work done before I'll have the ability to trust them again, it was horrifically run when I worked for them, which was rather recently.

What's your background in community outreach? Training in first aid? Experience with handling finance and donations?

-&gt; I have moderate training in first aid, but more classes never hurt. Community outreach isn't as much as some people boast but I have done some. I used to regularly donate to various charities and I've worked in a few places where handling money is a daily thing, with no complaints. 

You are quick to blame other organisations in Edinburgh, The Council may have its problems but they have huge resources and staff dedicated to helping homeless people in Edinburgh and I have seen first hand the good work that they do.

-&gt; I know, I realise my view of the council is most likely very biased and I've tried seeing the good they do but I'm very distrusting in them, they do indeed have a huge resource of people and equipment and supplies ect but they certainly don't use them effectively.

At the very least if they looked into it better and devised a new system to make the work spread around better so more people actually get help and set their priorities out a bit better they could be a god send, but sadly that's not how it is just now",0,1394931849,null,0,false,0,cg3m2vi,t3_20h5uq,t1_cg3m2vi,t1_cg3bh7e,null,1435546471,0,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,0
