true,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"&gt; So why can loyalism have no attachment to the mythology?

To be honest i don't particularly care how Loyalists appropriate Irish Culture, The Myths and they are myths *(no one is disputing that)* are stories to tell children, they don't form a central tenet to our sense of selves; If a fringe group of loyalists want to write fan fiction, fire away. I find it for the most part hilarious, it is extremely difficult to take seriously. Its sends deeply conflicting message:

&gt; In his book, Ringside Seats: An Insider's View of the Crisis in Northern Ireland, former civil servant Robert Ramsay supports manufacturing an ""Ulster Scots"" ethnicity that would be ""fashionably in harmony with the zeitgeist of today's European Union"". Ramsay is correct that the identity politics-obsessed EU would welcome just such a development, but such a move wouldn't be without problems for unionism.
&gt; 
&gt; For a start, it would be a tacit admission that the union was, as a political force, completely moribund. Creating a backward-looking, cod-aboriginal Ulsterish identity is a long way from Margaret Thatcher's 1981 declaration that ""Northern Ireland was as British as Finchley,"" or, indeed, the Ulster Unionist party's former campaign slogan, ""Simply British.""
&gt; 
&gt; In this sense it is an odd project for a liberal, British establishment figure such as Ramsay. Hitherto the Ulster Scots movement was associated largely with the fringes of loyalism, something Ramsay and his ilk have little time for.^[1](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/29/northern-ireland-unionism).

Why do certain sections of the Unionist community feel the need to re-invent themselves wasn't being British enough?

&gt; Yet the North/South divide is a recurring theme.

It really isn't; Have you actually read it? That's a desperately simplistic conclusion to take from an ancient mythical story to suit a modern political agenda. In the tale its the War is between [Connacht and Ulster](http://www.ireland101.com/images/county_crests/ireland-map.png) and Doesn't really involve the rest of Ireland. To further complicate matters the chief protagonist from Connacht, Queen [Medb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medb) is the ex-wife of the King of Ulster, [Conchobar mac Nessa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conchobar_mac_Nessa), also on the Connacht side is the former King of Ulster, [Fergus mac Róich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergus_mac_R%C3%B3ich) whom Conchobar mac Nessa had betrayed to become king. It all kicks off because Medb wants a bull. In the midst of all this is a hardy wee man who is a deft hand at hurling and animal abuse, Conchobar's nephew setanta, later to be known as [Cú Chulainn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%BA_Chulainn). 

&gt; Still, it's probably the first time I've read an Irish nationalist try to argue that their version of fantasy is more realistic than someone else's. A first, not a surprising one, and filled with a predictable arrogance culminating in your closing link.

I see it more like a terrible reboot of an old classic; it's gonna annoy fanboys.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;I hope this shoddy ""We NEED a striker"" mentality wears off

Thank you. I completely agree. We don't *need* a striker. We'll get goals from Coutinho, Henderson, Sterling, Lallana (when he's fit), etc. Hard to complain too much about a 2nd place finish last season (esp. when I thought it'd be a struggle to finish 4th) but one major complaint I had was our lack of goal-scoring diversity; Our opponents pretty much knew that it'd be Luis Suarez or Daniel Sturridge a majority of the time and that would be that. Raheem Sterling, at the time, was still relatively a question mark: Could he keep this up? (Turns out, yes, he can).

Sturridge's fitness always seems to be a concern but it's not as if Lambert has been picked up off the scrap heap; Lambert should be able to do in a pinch.

I think I might disagree with you slightly on Borini. Sure, great season for Sunderland but can he do it for Liverpool with the pressure of scoring goals in less amount of playing time? I'm not entirely sure about that. Upside, though, he's just 23-years-old.

What you're suggesting is that in order for Jews to live safely in Britain without fear of intimidation and violence, they should distance themselves from Israel. Fine. Why end there? Why not say that for anyone Jewish, Christian, Muslim or Athiest to live free from persecution, they should disown Israel? And why stop with Israel? Why not say that everyone in Britain who does not actively distance themselves from Israel, Syria, Russia, Sudan, Somalia, The US and any other country that is currently engaged in armed conflict?

There are 250,000 Jews in Britain. There are Jews who vehemently support Israel. There are Jews who support Israel but are critical of the current military activity. There are Jews who hate Israel. What all these people have in common are that they should be free to live their lives free from any persecution. To quote Hadley Freeman: ""Jews are not Israel (something liberal Jews have been saying for years) but nobody – not a London theatre, not even Steven Spielberg – has the right to tell them what to think about it, or to ask them to prove their good Jewish credentials by either supporting or condemning it.""

Also, with reference to the article, I imagine that the food was labelled as Kosher in Hebrew. Which is the language of the Jews. Nothing to do with Israel. It's highly unlikely that the food would have come from Israel, but even if it did come from Israel, that's no-one's fucking business.

I genuinely don't this is that big a factor. It only serves as a mechanism to further devide when ""black history month"" comes round.

I think the other points you make in regards to housing, education and criminal justice are the core elements as well as the reasonably recent history of segregation.

true,lord_tubbington,US,usa,"I mean I think because of his wages it's been hard not to keep Torres as the second forward. But with Drogba's legacy he'll certainly make an argument. When it comes down to it both players keep their heads down in the press and flat out work. Torres has age on his side and Drogba is likely in better form. I think they'll both get the odd start in cup games to give Diego a rest and it's up to Jose to see who is the late role sub.

 I've always naively wanted Torres to find his form and he looked better when he was working with Drogba so who knows? But that's a bit of a chelsea fan malady, having your heart a bit broken by Torres.

It was just one of those games though, where we could have had 100 more shots and still wouldn't score. Rotherham were sitting really far back (playing much more negatively than last season IMO), and lumping it forward whenever they got the ball back. It meant that while we bossed the midfield, through a combination of them being really defensive and bad luck, we couldn't really convert any chances. Their goal, of course, came from a corner, and honestly, apart from perhaps one chance in the first half, you couldn't see them scoring anything else. Ikeme literally had nothing to do all game apart from picking it out the net after a lucky rebound let them score.

Our back line was impressive again, and didn't really let them do anything with the balls lumped forward. Midfield was good too, McDonald really is a class player, they just struggled to create much because of Rotherham's defending. I don't think the forward and wingers looked as effective as they did against Norwich, but then again, our wingers were being double marked most game, and you're always going to struggle in circumstances like that. I still don't get why Sako takes so many corners though, he seems to hit the first man more often than not.

true,asteroid_9,null,null,"I appreciate how much thought you put into this and I'm a little disappointed it didn't spark more discussion but anyway I'll throw my thoughts out there. 

I don't think Brendan *likes* to experiment with formations but I do think he sets us up to play to the strengths of the players he has available. Last season he had to get both Sturridge and Suarez on the pitch as well as one of Coutinho or Sterling in a central role because that formation plays to their strengths and maximises our goals scored. So he came up with the 4-4-2 diamond for purely practical reasons. I think this shape asks too much of the center mids, they have to cover a hell of a lot of ground and as you mentioned it leaves our full backs exposed. For these reasons I wouldn't expect to see it used extensively this season. 

With everyone fit this year our most natural line up looks to be 4-3-3 with Sturridge as the focus. It's so difficult to predict though because as I said Brendan plays to the players strengths and until we've seen a bit more of the new boys it's hard to say exactly what those strengths are. With the versatility in the squad I wouldn't be surprised if Brendan started to mirror the formations of our opponents and rely on our individual 1v1 ability which he likes so much.

I rate Brendan that highly I feel like the things we are doing now are going to become the blueprint for a lot of managers in a few years time.

EDIT; thought of more stuff.

The really interesting thing for me is how he sets us up away in Europe. He doesn't have much experience here but I'm sure he knows the theory. Standard practice away in Europe seems to be a cautious defensive 4-5-1 ish approach, defend in numbers and try to nick one on the break. I'm interested to see how Brendan approaches it. I have a feeling we won't do well in the CL until he gets more of a feel for it but who knows we'll see.",0,1408229906,null,0,1408231064,0,cjs8lvo,t3_2dppzy,t1_cjs8lvo,t3_2dppzy,null,1435273281,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"&gt; May I assume that you're also just as loudly opposed to the desire for any state that is ethnically or religiously pure and exclusive, not just this one?

I am vocally opposed to any state with a legislated investment in one particular religion or ethnicity, when pertinent to conversation. I don't have much cause to discuss Cambodia very often, and it infrequently makes the news, so its state religion of Buddhism is I'm afraid something I get to decry less often than Israel's 'Jewish and democratic state'.

&gt;What do you think Hamas would do if the blockade was ended?

Lose vast amounts of popularity and legitimacy. There would be backlash, almost certainly. But if Israel allow food, medication and construction materials into Palestine unimpeded, that rather mitigates some of the complaints against them. If Israel further makes a commitment to introducing Palestinian representation in the Knesset and equal citizenship for Palestinians as citizens of an autonomous community, like Catalonia, that would also leave Hamas with rather a lot of egg on their face. If Israel refuse to oppress, Hamas, an organisation which claims to defend the oppressed, will be left without a job. Certainly many would argue that it wouldn't be enough, or that Israel still needs to be destroyed, or whatever, but I sincerely doubt that a majority of Palestinians would look a gift horse in the mouth and wilfully refuse aid and progress towards peace. Israel's military presence would have to remain as a defensive strategy against people who would use relaxed restrictions to try and escalate war, but all it takes is being open about those reasons and people will realize that fighting is no longer in their best interests.

Hell, I'm an incredibly cynical person. I don't think anything I say is going to happen because the ideologues on both sides are too stubborn and bigoted.

As the two banks of four aren't perfect for pressing but are better for containing with organisation. Equally, we know we want a better lone striker and Benitez's system was build around the premise of having a compromised striker up front who really couldn't do anything up top.

Despite how much I might hate Benitez as a person and he certainly didn't do anything aspirational. He was decent to tide us over till we could enact some proper change.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"&gt; What you're suggesting is that in order for Jews to live safely in Britain without fear of intimidation and violence, they should distance themselves from Israel.

I can understand how you could have read it that way, and I should have been more clear. My intention was not to victim-blame at all. Harassment and intimidation are always inappropriate. People are entitled to their views, whatever they might be.

However, it is perfectly acceptable to treat people differently based on the views they espouse. I don't have any friends who are racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. I won't give people who I know are racist, sexist or homophobic the time of day. I am under no obligation to respect the views of people who are racist, sexist or homophobic. As far as personal views and their intersection with socialization go, no-one owes anyone else anything. I don't expect that racists, sexists or homophobes especially enjoy my own *scintillating* company, and I don't expect or desire for them to do so.

As far as the actions of Israel goes, the situation is the same. If someone espouses Zionist sentiment or applauds Israeli military actions, I am free and inclined to dismiss them as someone I don't want to be around. If Israel's actions are inhumane, and I and I dare say most who oppose Israel would argue that they are, I am morally obligated to do no less.

People can say whatever they like, and people can listen to whatever they like. Assuming that a Jewish person is a Zionist or is in favour of Israel's military actions is of course wrong and idiotic, and not something I would do. The idiots with short attention spans that I speak of in my post well might do, in my opinion because of a lack of vocal Jewish opposition to Israel and Zionism. And that is what I am calling for in my capacity as Internet Guy With An Opinion. But don't feel obliged to pay attention.

&gt; Why end there?

I hope that my previous explanation demonstrates sufficiently my stance, and negates the need to examine the remainder of this paragraph. I'll add that it's also a slippery slope argument, which is logically fallacious.

&gt; persecution

Some would argue that what I'm talking about is persecution. If anything less than nodding and smiling and saying 'That's a legitimate perspective to hold' is persecution, there are a lot of people being persecuted right now. Flat Earthers, klansmen etc.

&gt; Jews are not Israel [...] but nobody [...] has the right to tell them what to think about it

People have the right to say whatever they like, Hadley Freeman, newspaper columnist writing an opinion piece about what people should say, do and think about Jewish people and Israel. But no-one has the right to be listened-to.


&gt; or to ask them to prove their good Jewish credentials by either supporting or condemning it."" 

I don't especially care whether people are 'good Jews' or not. Ethnicity is about as silly a thing to defend as the chromosome responsible for handedness. I think everyone should speak out against Israel's actions because I feel that they are inhumane. I am not Jewish (to the surprise of many, funnily enough), and have no horse in the race. The outcome of the conflict has no bearings on me whatsoever, apart from making me depressed. However, to those for whom their Jewish heritage, beliefs and ethnicity are important, they might choose (and I would in their shoes) to make a particular fuss about a state which claims to represent them and is currently engaged in 'self-defence' with a 90% civilian casualty rate.

true,Lebagel,null,null,"I once worked at one of the colleges where I helped the porters do a bike cull. This involved breaking all types of locks. 

Firstly, securing your bike can minimise the risk of stealing down to near 0, but never 0. If someone wants it badly, they can take it. 

Never leave it outside in the same place for long periods of time. People will come to know it, hatch a plan and it will be gone. 

The hardest lock to remove imo was a thick chain link (too thick to bolt crop) covered in a thick material cover. The material meant I couldn't see where my circular saw was hitting the links. The links also had to be cut twice on the same link to actually come undone. Very fiddly. 

D locks are good because you can't bolt crop them in a reasonable time. You have to circular saw them to get them off quickly. Chances are people don't have circular saws. If they do, it will come off very easily. Motorcycle locks are the same deal, just thicker. 

Any lock that can be bolt cropped is not safe (thin wirey locks, weak chain link locks). Bolt croppers are silent so practical for a thief,  and people have them. People don't tend to have circular saws. You could lock your bike up on kings parade with one of those locks and someone could take it in broad daylight it's so easy to do. ""lost my key, heh, looks bad I know"", *snip* and gone. 

Lock your bike to something (stops the frame being stolen) but also lock the mechanism up (wheel to frame) . If your object of security becomes compromised (you'd be surprised with how destructive people can be) and they get the lock unhooked, your bike will still be an awkward heavy useless piece of metal until they can cut the lock. This adds a lot of hassle. For this reason I use two locks. 

If you want to secure your tires, they have to be locked to something as well. No way around that. Especially with quick release. 

If your bike is locked in an awkward enough way, most criminals won't bother. You never know though someone might like a challenge. Good luck. ",0,1408237905,null,0,false,0,cjsbrq4,t3_2dpuxd,t1_cjsbrq4,t3_2dpuxd,null,1435275186,1,false,cambridge,t5_2qh8u,1

Just because of how bold and stubborn he is he seems the type of guy that either will have things going his way, or a spectacular implosion of the highest degree clashing with everyone on his way out. Hell, he already seems like he's been humbled in his first post-game interview.

Obviously it's too early to call, but after all the pre-season hype they actually struggled to really create anything on top of the result. I said it before in the ''build up'' and ''prediction'' threads - he's ONLY human. Yes, he's been successful in his *first* season a lot of places, but he's also been fired and had shitty runs with Barca in 02/03 (IIRC, around there) and sacked from Bayern. Yeah, he swapped a GK that has saved 0 penalties in his career for one a little better in the WC - just feeding the circlejerk material. But people forget he's human and this is the EPL, it's different here. His last real successes were with AZ - finishing 11th, 2nd, 3rd and winning the title is big (albeit Dutch football is pretty up &amp; down) - but that's almost a decade ago even then. I don't consider winning the title with Bayern as a real indication of anything to be brutally honest. His best work was with Ajax in the 90's. 

It's a bit knee jerk, but we'll see. I definitely didn't mind him going to Utd for ONE reason - he's a good ''get this shit in order, 1-2 season type of guy'' which is what they needed, not us.

true,Jo3Fr3sh,newcr-1,Non arte sed marte,"&gt;On average, it takes six weeks for a MCL injury to heal. The initial treatment for most grade 1, 2 or 3 MCL tears focuses on reducing the pain and inflammation in the knee while immobilizing the knee to keep it stabilized. This includes:

&gt;Resting, icing and elevating the knee
Taking pain relievers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, to ease pain and swelling
&gt;Wearing a lightweight cast or brace that allows your knee to move backward and forward while restricting side-to-side movement. It usually is recommended to keep the knee immobilized like this for 72 hours, depending on the severity of the injury.

Looks like Ross suffered a grade 3 MCL tear. 
Once the MCL has healed fully, you should have a minimum of long-term effects, providing there was no other damage to the knee.

&gt;Recovery times differ depending on the severity of the injury:
&gt;A minor, or grade 1, MCL tear can take from a few days to a week and a half to heal sufficiently for you to return to normal activities, including sports.
&gt;A grade 2 tear can take from two to four weeks to heal.
&gt;A grade 3 tear usually takes from four to eight weeks to heal, unless it is associated with damage to the ACL, in which case the recovery time may be longer.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"Even at Bayern, he was eventually bested by Klopp. Of course he's a great manager, but this is supposed to be the legendary Van Gaal. 

I do think he's a great manager (one that's influenced on of our top choices in FdB over the summer in some big ways), but he isn't that great. He's like Bielsa for me in the sense that his disciples-the Guardiolas, the de Boers, the Enriques-will do better than their masters. Bielsa's done this on a smaller scale, with our Poch, Sampaoli, Roger Schmidt in RB Salzburg to a degree, and arguably Klopp himself. 

Another thing I definitely agree with you on is the weakness of the leagues he's played in. Aside from the successes with Ajax, his first stint in Barca came during a time when the Galacticos program didn't exist, and he didn't do all too much in Europe.

Putting all of the big clubs he managed into historical context (for instance, he benefited a lot from Cruyff's groundwork in Barcelona, not to mention a strong Bayern squad, though the CL challenge was the major surprise for me) is something that Talksheeit doesn't seem to be doing. 

And really, he's the wrong fit for United in terms of getting them to play his ideal formation. He could've come into Tottenham and had mostly everything he needed to lay down the law. At United, he has to buy depth and quality with only two weeks to go.

Did you read what I said? These are not assumptions, these are things I actually witnessed on this sub when Sturridge and Mata left.. When Sturridge left us and started a little scoring spree people on here told others to not talk about him or his performances because it wasn't related to the club.

&gt; Also, since when is saying he looks a bit languid consider attacking/bad mouthing a player?

Its bad mouthing when all you can talk about someone is their faults. If the only time you talk about someone is when they are not doing well thats not just making innocent observations..

Also, I am not being overly sensitive mate. Lukaku's performance in a match between Everton and Leicester City has zilch to do with Chelsea Football Club. If you think it does via association I would love to see you post something positive about him when he does well or looks sharp, don't think we will see too much of those though. Just like Sturrdige, and Mata..

 [**Weeping Angels**](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Weeping%20Angels): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;The __Weeping Angels__ were a species of [quantum-locked](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Quantum-locking) [humanoids](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Humanoid), so called because their unique nature necessitated that they often covered their faces with their hands to prevent trapping each other in [petrified](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Petrification) form for eternity by looking at one another. This gave the Weeping Angels their distinct ""weeping"" appearance.  They were known for being murderous psychopaths, eradicating their victims ""mercifully"" by dropping them into the past and letting them live out their full lives, just in a different time period. This, in turn, allowed them to live off the remaining [time energy](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Time_energy) of the victim's life. However, when this potential energy paled in comparison to an alternative power source to feed on, the Angels were known to kill by other means, such as snapping their victims' necks.

To my eyes the ""Impossible Girl"" story arc was the beginning of Clara's development, not it's end.  It seemed meant to establish her as the Doctor's companion, not just 11 or 12's.  If she is leaving, and the BBC isn't willing to invest in keeping companions throughout a planned story arc, then there are fans that will begin to disengage from the show.  The show isn't just about the Doctor after all.  Yes, he is the focus, but the companions are just as important to the story and the show's success.

I don't think that's unique to Clara's character either.  If fans see a story developing, and begin to invest in it, the show needs to be able to see it through.  There are some stories, some changes, that really do need a few years to develop.

I honestly feel like there has been way too much hype about Capaldi taking the role.  ~~I'm sure he'll do a great job~~\*, but I want the focus to be on the stories, not the cast.

At our stage it's play the best player and win the most trophies. If we buy too many players there won't be any way to determine the value of our youth.

Specifically, you think that the lifting of the blockade would lead to Hamas getting pushed out of power by a populace that realizes there's no reason to hate Israel any more. But, Hamas is not a political party that will slouch away muttering ""wait 'til next time"" after they lose an election. They are a terrorist organization/mini-dictatorship which is adroit at media manipulation and propaganda, not to mention sheer naked violence. It is simply not in Hamas's interests for the people of Gaza to be fat, happy, and uninterested in fighting Israel. So Hamas will make sure they aren't.

If I had to guess what would happen? The lifting of the blockade would be spun by Hamas as a military victory: the Zionists' will is breaking after their brave resistance, now's the time to redouble the fight! Iranian heavy weapons would be imported in huge amounts. Some skimpy pretext for continuing the fight would be found, just as happened with Hezbollah after the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, and endorsed by the usual international suspects. The ultimate result would be another war just like the one we just had a few years later, except far more vicious, with many more casualties on both sides. And probably another blockade at the end of it.

The Daleks I've been joking about, like TAKE A SHOT EVERYTIME SOMEONE SAYS 'THE LAST OF THE DALEKS' YOU'LL GO TO THE HOSPITAL. They just aren't threat and they keep popping up to be called the last of the daleks again. 

When YANA and then the Master popped up I was basically on the edge of my seat going HOLY SHIT WHAT JUST HAPPENED WHAT AM I WATCHING OH MY GOD IT JUST GOT REAL

5:  **The Five Doctors** and **The Caves of Androzani**

There are many things to like about Can but what I like the most is that he allows Henderson to push forward into more of an attacking role and that is something that Rodgers seems to want as well. And both Can and Henderson have the ability and work rate to fluidly switch roles as the match dictates.

As for Southampton, I totally agree:

&gt;Southampton are far from a team that are in ""disarray"" as some media have been saying.

Much has been made about the departure of Shaw, Lallana, Lovren and Lambert and they are certainly significant losses but someone on /r/Soccer posted Southampton's starting XI last season in comparison to this season and, y'know what? It's not in shambles as some may suggest.

true,[deleted],null,null,"First of all, let's all calm down a bit. Roberto didn't say he'll be out for five months, he said he *could* be out for *up to* five months. The time fame is still approximately 6-20 weeks. Yes, he said he'll be out for ""a long, long time"", but with with a player we love as much as Ross, anything more than a match without him feels like ""a long, long time."" We won't know until we know, so let's chill for now.

If he's out for around eight weeks or less, I think we'll be okay without him. We saw how good Naismith is behind the striker against Leicester City, and him, Mirrallas, Osman, Pienarr, McGeady, and Atsu, should be able to hold things down for a couple of months.

If Barkley's out for more than eight weeks or so, then we're a bit fucked. With Naismith playing in midfield and Kone's fitness an enigma, we'd be down to pretty much one capable striker. As much as I love Lukaku, he needs rest just like anybody. If Barkley's going to be out for more than of couple months, we need to get somebody on loan to play in that role, and maybe a striker as well (after Leicester, I think we need a centre back as well, but that's unrelated). We have a thin enough squad as it is, and without a Barkley-type, Lukaku and Naismith will be zombies by early February, if not sooner (not to mention how much an injury to either of them or any of the midfield would get us fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists).

It'll be okay. I'm absolutely gutted about Ross's injury, both as a supporter and a humam being. As much as it sucks to be a Barkley fan at the moment, I can't imagine how horrible this must be for him. This was going to be his breakout year, but now he's stuck watching idly. And he's gonna miss the derby. And his knee hurts.

Get well soon, and COYB. (Also keep in mind that I'm an idiot who has no idea what he's talking about).",0,1408256523,null,0,1408256969,0,cjsiixb,t3_2drxom,t1_cjsiixb,t3_2drxom,null,1435278962,9,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,9

He won't qualify for a UK work permit now, so that's a huge hindrance. Playing for us depends on how he does at Bastia, leading to game time with the NT and thus paving way for a work permit.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt;&gt; So why can loyalism have no attachment to the mythology?

&gt;To be honest i don't particularly care how Loyalists appropriate Irish Culture, The Myths and they are myths *(no one is disputing that)* are stories to tell children, they don't form a central tenet to our sense of selves; If a fringe group of loyalists want to write fan fiction, fire away. I find it for the most part hilarious, it is extremely difficult to take seriously. 

Quoting extensively on myths one minute, yet completely disregarding them the next because of themmuns. OK.

&gt; For a start, it would be a tacit admission that the union was, as a political force, completely moribund. Creating a backward-looking, cod-aboriginal Ulsterish identity is a long way from Margaret Thatcher's 1981 declaration that ""Northern Ireland was as British as Finchley,"" or, indeed, the Ulster Unionist party's former campaign slogan, ""Simply British.""

&gt;Why do certain sections of the Unionist community feel the need to re-invent themselves wasn't being British enough?

I'm not sure what your question is here but from that wall of text the only thing I need to point out is that Jason Walsh is wrong: the British as Finchley line refers to the fact Northern Irish culture, and thus myths like Cuchulainn, are inherently British the same as anything coming out of north London.

It would be obviously incorrect to say 'as English as Finchley', yet that is what Walsh really means, taking as he does in his 'journalism' a narrow minded nationalist stance where the UK is an Imperial and wholly English venture. I've no time for it.

&gt;&gt; Yet the North/South divide is a recurring theme.

&gt;It really isn't; Have you actually read it? That's a desperately simplistic conclusion to take from an ancient mythical story to suit a modern political agenda.

King William and the pope fought on the same side, doesn't mean loyalists can't celebrate the Boyne as a victory for Protestantism in Ireland. It's a context. 

The Hound of Ulster was trained in Scotland. One of the fundamental reasons for mythology is creating a narrative. The Ulster people today are not homogeneous. There will always be a place within loyalism for the Ulster Cycle.

&gt;it's gonna annoy fanboys.

I like Costa because he is a good footballer and because he is a world class striker...

A lot of yanks blame the British empire for drawing lines on maps but really the source of this one goes all the way back to the Ottoman Empire. 

Just admit defeat and split the country up. Western powers should support the Kurds - they are a lot closer in outlook to us, they usually protect small ethnic/religious groups and they actually want our help. The Shia areas will likely become an Iranian puppet state but there's not really any helping that. The Sunni areas will end up as ISIS or whomever emerges from the fratricidal bloodbath when they actually gain power. 

The only alternatives are sitting US/UK militaries there for decades of grinding insurgency warfare and taking casualties the whole damn time - with things going straight back to how they are right now pretty much as soon as the occupiers leave - or 'making a desert and calling it peace' ... and frankly I'm not a huge fan of genocide (understatement).

What the article should say:

&gt;Iraq is the jewel of any empire, the theory goes that if you control Iraq you control the middle east. It has rivers that run into neighbouring countries with deserts, it has oil, it has excellent strategic value being in the gulf (fantastic for our expensive warships) and bordering Syria and Iran.
Whoever controls Iraq has everything they need to control the middle east. These Isis members will never go for our usual economic tactics and there is no easy way to assassinate a clear leadership so full scale military is the only option left to defend the empire.

Our policies of invading the middle east, funding and supporting brutal dictatorships, crushing the arab left and unconditionally supporting Israel are why they are a threat to our national security. The acts of our government have converted more Muslim men down the disgusting path of war than any religious leader ever could. More war will not save us.

true,SecretApe,,"His name is John Carew, he's bigger than the two of you!","We played much better defensively yesterday and with a lot of discipline. But I hope that we can carry this momentum into the next game against Newcastle. That will be a tougher game in my opinion, so lets hope we can build on this performance.

The partnership of Lambert and Keane (who I like to call the dream-team) is fantastic. I love seeing the two involved in the game, and maybe some really good calls during the game. Allowing Crouch to get to the long ball was a stroke of genius.

I will admit, I wasn't pleased with the arrival of Senderos. But Vlaar and Senedros actually played really well together, they have a good understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses and I reckon they also get along off-field. Great to see, let's just hope that we can keep hold of Vlaar because if he leaves, the experienced defence is broken.

I love the way that Hutton played, good passes, good awareness and I think he'll play the majority of this seasons games. N'Zogbia might be dropped next game, I didn't think he played that great, gave the ball away too much. But hopefully we'll see more of Bent, who I think would do better as a lone striker than Agbonlahor because he can actually pounce on chances.

In general, I'm happy with the performance. We didn't play beautiful football, but I think that majority of Villa fans want results of style.

Such a state would be a safe haven for Islamic extremists to train and plan attacks on us. 

Committing ground troops would of course be ridiculous as that's what got us into this mess in the first place, but really we have no choice but to at least lend intelligence and drop a few bombs on ISIS. Even if we ignore the potential genocide as an issue that we don't care about, it's in our interests to weaken ISIS to prevent them from becoming a real threat to their neighbours and us in the coming decades. 

The ""but what about other countries"" thing doesn't really hold when other countries ARE already helping out militarily. If you don't want the UK to help out unless every other country in the world is helping then that's not really going to create a sensible foreign policy is it? The UK is a military power that likes to take an active role in the world. Expecting Zimbabwe or Saudi Arabia to fly in to prevent the genocide instead is just laughable.

In terms of insulation, once you've done the basics - draught proofing, loft insulation, cavity insulation, secondary/double glazing it gets extremely expensive for diminishing returns. 

Retrofitting Victorian houses comes with a huge host of problems, and they make up a huge % of our housing stock, so can't be ignored - 

- External wall insulation is expensive - £6,000-15,000 depending on the size of your house. There's the visual aspect. Plus the fact we simply don't know the long term effects on moisture transport through the wall. These houses were designed to wick moisture outwards to keep them dry. Also people are precious about the look of the front of their homes. Who wants to be the one the slaps white render on their middle terrace home when nobody else does?
 
- Internal wall insulation is also expensive. Likely worse issues with trapping moisture. Plus it's quite complicated as everything has to be stripped from the walls and detailing can be difficult. 

- Air tightness and ventilation - once you've got a highly insulated structure you need to ventilate it correctly. If you ventilate too much you lose heat, not enough and you trap stale air/moisture.

- Floors - no point in paying £20,000+ if you don't have a continuous insulating shell. Nobody really knows the implications of insulation suspended floors, but it could causes serious problems with wood rot as you're effectively insulating the timbers from the heat in your home. Replacing floor timbers in 10 years would like negate energy cost savings. 

Very very few contractors/tradesmen/government staff understand these issues, especially how different measures interact with each other. If we fuck it up, it becomes an extremely expensive and a complete waste of resources. 

There's quite a lot of data that shows when you retrofit someones home, you make them a lot more comfortable, but actually energy use remains the same (or even goes up) it's called 'comfort takings'. People were freezing, but now they can afford heat. It's a good thing, but doesn't help with carbon or energy reductions. 

Just some things to think about. The only few people I've met who truly understand the costs of upgrading British homes say it's probably better to knock them all down and start again.

In contrast to Simpson I thought Traoré was fine in his position.

My other main concern is Remy - so obviously talented yesterday, but his body language worried me a bit. I hope he stays until January but I'm not counting on it. His footwork is something that Charlie and Bobby don't have. I doubt Sigthorsson has it and at this stage even with big money we won't be able to buy it in.

Elsewhere I'm not so stressed. We were unlucky to come away with nothing. 

I thought the defense were ok, even with Dunne. It was good to see Ferdinand barking out instructions to everyone looking like he meant it; any concerns over his signing should be put to bed for now, it looks like he brings a touch of that classic Man U dressing room in a way that Park couldn't.

I liked the look of Mutch, and I'm hoping he develops into something special for us. He was running around with an intensity that Kranjcar, Carroll and Ravel didn't serve up last year in my opinion. Faurlin's distribution is adequate. Maybe Barton needs to roll back his duties a bit and stick to adding bite at the back of midfield.

Again....Richard Dunne. The guy is a rock and i think he played well despite my preference in Onuoha. Would like to see Onuoha play against Spurs as i believe they will be a bit more pacey and suitable to Onuoha's attributes.

BZ may not be the best sub. He is quite slow on the ball, and would rather see a new striker fill his role.

Remy is class, especially in the first half. Austin was OK and didn't really look confident in that penalty kick. Would have given it to Barton, especially at that moment of the game.

The only changes that i would make is Isla for Simpson if he is as good as HR says he is. I would also swap Dunne for Onuoha. Overall i was really happy with the performance. My god were we unlucky to score at least two goals, but we have to perform on set pieces as it is becoming ridiculous. HR said that we played far better than last season in the Championship, and i couldn't agree more.

There's no big creation myth or sense of national apotheosis. There's no post-imperial superiority or inferiority complex. They won some, they lost some, and they are what they are.

We don't have that in Northern Ireland. We keep being pigeonholed into 'nationalist' or 'unionist', and within that every person has their own very individual interpretation of national identity and that can be complex. 

Irish culture is certainly part of a shared history, and I guess I'd rather see it politicised by both than unilaterally.

""Mass killing""

That phrase there.

Palestinians suffered more when they went to *Lebanon* 

If ""mass killing"" to you is the same as ""2000 people over the course of a month"" *maybe* you should look up some other conflicts. 

Like maybe Rwanda. Go stand outside the French embassy and complain that they sold them machetes. 

Or ISIS. They kill 700 people in one day sometimes. That's actually ongoing. 

Actually, if ""Mass killing of a people"" = ""Terrorist dead and maybe someone standing nearby.""

Because that's the truth here. Hamas' own estimates said it was 4 civilians per terrorist. That's also what the UN printed. 

That's Hamas saying that ""Yeah, Israel gets better ratios than the USA and the UK.""

Israel printed a number of about 45-55 terrorist to civilian. 

Also, just.. before.. 

Israel has never been found guilty of war crimes by any legitimate organisation.

Firing a gun and leading a squad of soldiers is a useless waste of time when you are responsible for one of the world's largest economies and most influential diplomatic entities.

Even historically, kings wouldn't usually lead in the front line. They might sit on a hill behind the battle on a horse with their guards but they wouldn't typically be in the fray itself.

There are loads of societies and I found running and taking part in them to be a highly rewarding experience that I recommend highly, Freshers fair is a great place to find societies you want to join.

Chelsea did grind out results when we played poorly, we didn't grind out results when the other team was organized. At that time we weren't playing poorly they were organized and we needed a striker which we have now.

We lost the league by 4-5 goals again bottom sides. Arsenal lost the league by conceding 20 to top sides. They can not make that up, we can easily make that up.

I'm doing nothing of the sort, you saucy tart. I'm putting the prevalence of muslims who joined ISIS into context and showing that those who joined ISIS are outnumbered by 4000 to 1. Is it not important to recognise that the vast majority of British Muslims haven't joined ISIS, because lets face it the numbers are overwhelming. 


&gt;As I said, not every supporter will join ISIS. They might have 1000 supporters for every 1 person who actually goes and joins.

That's pure conjecture, you pulled that number out of your arse, that argument leads to a fifth column conjecture and the underlying idea that no muslims can be trusted and that is completely unjust. A fundamental basis of our justice system is that you are  responsible only for your own actions. Every muslim is an individual, they dont all think the same. Those who have joined ISIS are a tiny minority among british muslims. 

&gt;I'll use my same example as before: 

&gt;What % of British people are against fracking? 

No idea

&gt;And what % have even written an email to their MP? 

You tell me

&gt;And what % joined a protest? 

Show me the data

&gt;And what % would actually go and kill somebody for what they believe in? 

That depends on the circumstances I guess. 

&gt;And what % would be willing to die themselves?

Again that depends on the circumstances. 

Protesting fracking is hardly the equivalent to creating a theocratic state ruled strictly along religious lines, imposing a very puritanical perception of sharia law. 

Creating a theocratic state and using political violence to do so is the equivalent to the creation of modern Israel or the russian revolution. Its a manifestation of a political ideology.  Fracking protesters have no designs to create a fracking free state.

&gt;That's why your number of 1/4000 means precisely bugger all. 700 people going to join is still VERY worrying, and it's fairly shocking that people like you are apparently attempting to downplay this.

Where am I downplaying anything, 700 out of 2.7 million people who have gone to join an extremist group. The numbers who joined ISIS are outnumbered 4000 to 1 by British Muslims who didn't.

- [Seamus Coleman](http://i.imgur.com/zcj0mMK.jpg)

Right back. We bought him ridiculously cheap. Like, less than 100,000 cheap. When Moyes was managing us he didn't really see a lot of value in him and usually preferred to play either Hibbert or Neville over him, two older players who are a bit dire sometimes. When he started starting most games he was phenomenal. He's a good attacking-minded defender, a bit like Baines, and we can look forward to him scoring a silly amount of goals for a defender this season as well. Plays for the Republic of Ireland.

 - [Sylvain Distin](http://i.imgur.com/o5IRiCH.jpg)

Center back. This guys ancient. He's solid at the back and super quick even at the ripe old age of 36. He came to us from Portsmouth and was originally wanted by Rafa Benetiz at Liverpool, who reckons that if he'd have signed him they would have won the league. [He spends a lot of his time on twitter abusing Liverpool fans, which is just nice.](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2092696-sylvain-distin-has-incredible-comeback-on-twitter-to-liverpool-fans-trolling-him) [Recently retired from international football in order to prolong his career with us, which is also nice.](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/14/sylvain-distin-france-retirement-international-fooball) French.

 - [Phil Jagielka](http://i.imgur.com/aP3pslX.jpg)

Captain, centre back. Came to us from Sheffield United. [Star of a lot of  photos of him and Baines looking like giddy little girls](http://i.imgur.com/uyRiDx9.jpg). Recently enjoyed a bunch of call ups to the English national team which is cool. 

 - [Kevin Mirallas](http://i.imgur.com/BD66PX7.jpg)

One of my favourite players. Flashy at the feet and links up well with Coleman. One of our superstar Belgians. Legend has it he locked himself in a hotel room with Lukaku until the latter agreed to join him at Everton on loan. [Enjoyable is his banter with Coleman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdVXv_Yu9eI#t=130). He seems to have a really good relationship with everyone at the club which is great to see. 

 - [James McCarthy](http://i.imgur.com/kDNW9bd.jpg)

Midfielder. When Martinez came to Everton from Wigan he brought with him Alcarez, Kone and McCarthy. The other two have yet to make an impact but McCarthy has become a central figure in our midfield. Young too, definitely one for future Ireland teams. 

 - [Gareth Barry](http://i.imgur.com/cg2uvUq.jpg)

Older, experienced midfielder. Always looks shocked for some reason. He came to us from Man City on loan last season and signed on a permanent this season. He's great for the younger players to look up to and provides invaluable experience and squad depth. Would love for him to finish his career with us on a high note with some trophies. 

 - [Steven Pienaar](http://i.imgur.com/5qEVUwy.jpg)

Another older player. Plays on the left in front of Baines. He left Everton a few years ago to go to Tottenham, with whom he thought he'd get more medals. We got 2 million for him. It didn't work out though and he came back to us on loan. At the end of that season he said to Moyes that he missed us and wanted to come back so we bought him back for 4 million. It was seen as stupid business at the time but his link up play with Baines is worth it. Recently retired from the south african national team to prolong his career with us.

 - [Ross Barkley](http://i.imgur.com/zBF7OXw.jpg)

The next big thing in English football. He's an academy player, local lad who loves the club. He's just the ideal Everton player, tough as nails and loves doing well.

Little Leon Osman. Liverpool fan as a child, but we sorted that out quick. A club icon, he's been with us for ages and while he's not that flashest player on the pitch we all love him.

The profit levels of the other players (again back of the bill shows where your money is going) is also likely to be findable. National Grid need a lot of capital investment so they will be up front.

Basically if you don't want these companies making profits, don't expect them to raise money for the infrastructure  investments (they need more than they make out of you).

Mignolet

Henderson - Gerrard - Lucas

Sterling - Coutinho

Sturridge

With regards to the midfield, I'm glad Lucas has a starting position. Though Can will probably come on as a substitute, the whole ordeal about Lucas being ready to leave the club and whatnot will probably be watered down if Lucas can perform well as a starter. Touch the ball a decent amount of times, maybe perform an assist and I think the rumors will start to die down of his discontent. 

With regards to the defense, I'm glad Manquillo and Lovren are both starting. Manquillo has something to prove, coming into the Premier League as young as he is, and if he puts up a strong performance today it'll be great for both his and the team's morale. 

Lovren proved his worth during pre-season, and I'd love to see his form continue. As he said before, ""his head is at Liverpool"", so you know he will be giving that 110%, especially against his former team during the first game of the season.

true,Aedonix,null,null,"My personal opinion is that the whole ""Gateway drug"" argument is false.  The ONLY reason cannabis is considered a gateway drug is because of the underground network that sells it wanting to move their customers on to the more ""profitable"" drugs (i.e. the ones which are cut with all kinds of crap thereby containing less of the drug itself and more talcum powder etc)  The whole criminalization was initially due to some big name companies worried that it threatened their profits.

I would happily bet on the fact that if pot became legal and was taxed and readily availbale from authorized sources, you would see a reduction in use from those who get a secondary buzz from ""bucking the system""  as well as a significant reduction in the legal system from prosecuting people both dealing it, and in posession of it as they would no longer be criminals and therefore the taxpayers money would not be being thrown away in prosecuting people from waging a war (the drugs war) that no government can ever hope to win.

The profits issue is not clear. The figures put forward by people pick short periods (e.g the Labour Party figures in the article) and are never clear about which profits they mean. 


As always look at who stands to gain. 

The political parties (all of them) have no intention of nationalising. They have no plans to take on that much debt. They are all happy to use the indirect taxation approach that privatisation was designed to create.

The big six are playing the start and end of the energy supply chain. Their supply companies are designed as bullet sponges that turn a steady profit. Things get murky at the other end. The banks and other players are just happy being off the radar on this one (ever heard anyone complain about the dividend Nation Grid pays it's shareholders?).

true,bottomlines,null,null,"&gt;I'm putting the prevalence of muslims who joined ISIS into context and showing that those who joined ISIS are outnumbered by 4000 to 1. Is it not important to recognise that the vast majority of British Muslims haven't joined ISIS, because lets face it the numbers are overwhelming.

Which is a WORTHLESS statement to make because it says nothing about SUPPORT. 

As I have repeatedly pointed out, **many people may SUPPORT isis, but few would go join them**. 700 is still a worrying number. Attempting to downplay this with a stupid 1/4000 calculation is beyond ridiculous.

But let's carry this example forward so I can point out how stupid it is.

&gt;Protesting fracking is hardly the equivalent to creating a theocratic state ruled strictly along religious lines, imposing a very putitanical perception of sharia law.

Right. Only a truly insane fuckface would support establishing a state of puritanical sharia law where people will be stoned to death for sex outside of marriage, yeah? Protesting fracking and wanting to protect the environment should be easier and more common, right? Especially since it requires nothing more than driving for an hour and standing in a street holding a placard for a while. Certainly not as risky as flying to Iraq and shooting people.

So let's look at some numbers.

Guardian poll - ~25% of UK public disagree with fracking (http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/28/fracking-protest-david-cameron-public-support-poll). 

So let's do your kind of maths. Let's use the whole UK population as a basis (because you did - you included children and women in the total number of muslims even though they don't participate in joining ISIS). So that's a UK population of 63 million people. And 25% against. That's 15.75m. 

And how many took part in protests? Article from March from a nice anti-fracking website says 1000 people is the largest protest to that date.

http://ecowatch.com/2014/03/10/largest-fracking-protest-uk-history/

So the next time someone talks about fracking, according to your logic, I can say ""But only 1000 people have protested it. That's only 1 out of every 63,000 people in the UK. That's even less than the proportion of British Muslims who joined ISIS!!""

Or I could apply it to anything. You won't like it when we start looking at what % of the public have given money to pro-gay marriage organisations. Then I'm going to say ""only 1 out of every 5000 people has supported gay marriage"". That's 4999 times more people who didn't support gay marriage than did!

However, back to fracking. I don't have a definite number of people who demonstrated, so let's be insanely generous and boost the protest numbers of the largest ever protest by 10x, just to be safe. Let's say that actually 10,000 people have demonstrated. So, 10,000/63,000,000. That's 6300 to 1. Oh, how strange! That's even less than your estimate about Muslims joining ISIS.

At times your CV and current designation brands you as only being able to do some jobs and you cannot move from there. So you need to find a way to shift / move away from that to achieve your career goals.  
  
If you cannot find such roles in the UK with your current CV look elsewhere in the EU or even globally.  
   
Work for a few years outside, get some international experience and then plan for a move back - it might help you rebadge yourself and give you negotiation power to get higher paying jobs.

true,bottomlines,null,null,"Great article, thanks for posting.

I entirely agree. It is very important for us to have our own military which is large and powerful and able to protect the UK and project force elsewhere if necessary.

In general the EU is lagging behind. Most countries fail to hit the 2% of GDP defence target that NATO recommends. In fact, NATO is largely propped up by the US, and this clearly is not sensible for advantageous for the UK.

We've got a middle east which is a volatile shit hole. We've got Putin in control of Russia who is now flexing his muscle more and getting braver in how much shit he talks to the west. He's basically been caught lying 10x over Ukraine and told us to go fuck ourselves. We've got a rising China who are pouring enormous investment into their own military and want to develop a full blue water navy.

We would be absolutely mental at this point to reduce defence spending or to just let everything get old and shitty.

I mean, damn, the Royal Navy only has 95 ships. Only 6 submarines (excluding trident subs). And from what I understand our national air defence consists of only 6 destroyers and we don't have any land-based missile shield or anti-air defences. The RAF only has 100 fighter aircraft (Eurofighter) and 100 strike aircraft (which is the Tornado from the 1980's). It will be replaced god knows when by the F-35, which we have only ordered 45 of.

Granted, our military is still decent right now. But we should not be complacent at all. Plus there's all the benefits listed in the article - science, technology and medical developments which come along with military spending.

It's no wonder that playing two up front worked so well for Timmy last season... it allowed our wide players to contribute less by offering another body in the middle of the park towards their box.

I'm not advocating playing two up front per se... but I think it's a lot harder to play one striker when you don't have at least a proper winger on the pitch (and I don't count Lennon as a proper winger... he doesn't deliver enough of a consistent attacking threat).",0,1408278951,null,0,false,0,cjsmxit,t3_2dsmhe,t1_cjsmxit,t3_2dsmhe,null,1435281165,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Personally I think it is a travesty. The NHS should be supplying free aid to only the Domiciled UK citizens, and those within the E111 system (funny how we never hear how much they spent on E111 cases and how much is re-paid from the EU funding?)

Things such as 'Cosmetic surgery' (where the work is purely aesthetic rather than, for example, reducing the risk of scarring in operations etc) and Fertility treatment should not be supplied as part of the NHS, both of these are not life and death cases, Yes I feel bad for people who have issues conceiving, but will you really die if you do not have a child?

The other part of the issue is the constant 'micromanaging' of NHS funding, gone are the ward nurses and the Nursing Banks (where available nurses could cover shortfalls) and instead they wrote new contracts for GPs that went badly wrong.

What they need to do is to review why each PCC needs so much money to be run, why so many managers all covering the same issues, why the fragmented supply chain and dire NHS systems.

&gt;A __vactrain__ (or __vacuum tube train__) is a proposed design for super-[high-speed rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail) transportation. It is a [maglev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev) (magnetic levitation) line using [evacuated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum) (air-less) or partly evacuated tubes or tunnels. Travel through evacuated tubes allows supersonic speed without the [sonic boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_boom) of supersonic aircraft. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] The lack of air resistance could permit vactrains to travel at extremely high speeds—up to 4,000–5,000 mph (6,400–8,000 km/h), which is 5–6 times the [speed of sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound)—using relatively little power.  [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Vactrains might use [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_train) to assist their acceleration. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] If these trains achieve the predicted speeds, the trip between [Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing) and [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) would take less than 2 hours, surpassing [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft) as the world's fastest mode of public transportation. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

An English parliament would aim to do the same, as at the moment Scottish, Welsh MP, NI MPs get to decide how English healthcare etc works. Perhaps even and English parliament this would be too large to really tailor services to local areas. Would local parliaments or giving councils more power, allow more local solutions to problems. 

Now healthcare is one thing but what if you could change a limited set of taxes to attract certain kinds of business to your area? The North of England could lower certain taxes to try to get manufacturing back into the Northern towns or lure high tec jobs up North?

Quick-release wheels are bad. I've had the QR wheels from my bike stolen from outside of my house, and it's not even in a busy area. I swapped the QR skewers for ones which require tools to remove, and always use an additional cable lock through the wheels as well. The bikes are also stored out of sight.

In terms of safety to our country, what influence does killing some guy in a desert 3000 miles away really have on keeping us safe? As near as matters none. 

Maybe shifting our military towards a purely defensive role, but a more comprehensive defensive role would make more sense. 

I mean, what do you *really* need to defend the UK from attack? 

* Comprehensive anti air across at least the east and south coasts of the UK, with extra around major population areas.

* A decent sized fleet of attack subs to defend our waters 

* A decent airforce, again to defend our waters

* Trident to protect against nuclear attack

* Small army to repel anyone who actually manages to land on our beaches (Never going to happen)

Having much of a surface fleet at all seems extremely outdated when it comes to battling an advanced military. And only an advanced military would stand a chance crossing the channel..

Manquillo and Lovren have been fantastic. Every clearance Lovren makes is useful in nature and always ends up at the feet of a Red. Skrtl, on the other hand, is very average. His clearances are wayward, and he has been looking like a liability all game. I don't know, maybe I just have greater expectations from him. Johnson is no longer a defender in my book, he's more of a winger with a terrible shot, from either foot. His contribution is next to nil and he will hopefully be subbed.

Gerrard and Lucas are doing a great job holding up the midfield. Hopefully, we get a look at Can (fan favourite, amirite?) and what he's beastliness can bring to they pitch. Hendo is absolutely phenomenal and I hope he carries this form throughout the rest of the season. He's always on the gas, making interceptions and pushing the ball forward - a world class box-to-box midfielder, IMO. 


Couts is being choked off, so we haven't seen much of him, but I hope he can produce more in the second half. Studge is just whatever. He has a tremendous amount of potential but he hasn't shown me much this match aside from two wayward shots and a decent passing. Sterling, on the other hand, is sublime. Not just the incredibly composed first-time finish, but also his pace and work rate on both attack and defence. This kid has a fantastic future and I hope he lives up to all the hype.

In places where theres a natural monopoly in place, like the current rail franchising system we've got, then I would support fully nationalising the railways because of the wealth of evidence that current private offering is crap.

In a market which is not tied to geography, like the energy market - and correct me if I'm wrong here, but I'm led to believe that you can largely switch who you pay your gas bill to in a fairly free manner - then instead I'd probably go for a government-owned supplier who supply gas or other energy at cost price or ever-so-slight profit price.

true,Mercc96,eng-kent,Kent,"The problem with Sativex or other medicines like that is it just doesn’t give people the same amount of choice/ ability to find a strain that works for them. 

Each strain and family of strains have vastly different amounts of cannabinoids and terpenes and we are just discovering how important these terpenes are, let alone how important the cannabinoids other than THC /CBD are. 

These cannabinoids change properties when heat is applied to them aka ‘blazing up’ or vaporisation and even change how the brain and body takes up or uses the chemicals.  

What happens if the plants GW pharma work with don’t have the right profile for you?

What if you have a chronic stomach illness that is exacerbated by the alcohol in sativex?  

What if you need relief faster than a tablet can provide? , oral cannabis can be far more sedating then inhaled cannabis so for some people smoking is preferential for them. 

In the US or if you grow yourself you are free to try out the many different variants of cannabis out there and find what works best for you, for example I know that for myself I get better relief smoking cannabis from the Bubba Kush linege than I do from the ChemD family strains (despite being more potent) since I’ve been able to go to the US and actually select and try out the different offerings and I’m sure I’m yet to find the very best strain for me yet.

 Its all just weed right? Wrong.  The cannabinoid / terpene profile of Bubba Kush is unique to the plant itself ( and influenced by how it it is grown and its environment)  and obviously works better for my needs than the profile unique to a strain of the ChemD. Bubba Kush is a strain known to have a higher CBD, CBG profile, I’d imagine it also has a very unique terpene profile too. 

Although I was a little surprised/confused and disappointing that I didn't find the Chem to be particularly effective since I find OG's very helpful and the two are supposedly related anyway I'm digressing.

Yes you can isolate the chemicals and mix them into different amounts but that hasn’t worked very well in the past.  Why this is the case we do not know yet, but I'd imagine cannabis as a medicine works like an opera as in all together at once playing its part correctly or it doesn't work at all.

http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diet-and-nutrition/medicines/acomplia.html

http://www.emedicinehealth.com/drug-dronabinol/article_em.htm

If you want to see medical cannabis done right take a look at Green Dot Labs, like a lot of other companies out there in Denver they have their plants or in this case concentrates thoroughly tested. It helps that they also work with some of the best plants out there. 

http://greendotlabs.com/our-good-medicine-cbd-project/untitled/#main

Personally I think concentrates are possibly the best direction to head towards for medical cannabis, as much as I enjoy smoking cannabis I need to smoke a lot of it to get the relief I’m looking for. This is fine if you have iron lungs or loads of time in the day to actually spend smoking. Properly done concentrates however pack the same amount of medicine (not just THC, terpenes and other cannabinoids too)  into one hit and last much longer than flower - much better for the lungs.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"To be fair, everyone was pretty poor. He showed some great touches and always had that little bit of flair about him (Lamela). I think going down to 10 didn't help, and also you tend to miss the easy option when you're trying so hard. You could tell he was - at one point he lost the ball, then did really well to sprint and close down and win it straight back again - he was TOO hungry to impress and that's detrimental, imo. I don't blame the kid - he's come back of a massive injury, his first start since what...Christmas? 

So I think Lamela just needs to settle. He's not in ''that groove'' yet. His first season at Roma was good, but his second was incredible. I mean nobody really stood out yesterday, tbh. Like Eriksen yesterday he was quiet - but if some of his ideas worked out, he would have been MotM. So many nice little flicks and creative passes that just got cut out. Everyone was to a point which is expected with varying levels of fitness, some people at the WC, some not, some playing more pre-season and some barely involved. I don't think it's indicadive of much - actually it reinforced the fact Lamela is strong enough for the EPL - one of his runs was great and he had someone all over him and just shrugged it off. 

Just needs to settle and get comfortable with the system (he was in the middle, on the left, then the right) in periods and getting comfortable with *knowing* the overlap is coming, like you said. That goes for the whole team - everyone was a yard off the pace or under/over hitting passes which is just early season stuff. Once the system is ingrained into everyone he'll be fine - he showed in Europe what he can do with his vision, he hasn't lost that. I liked his hunger though, I remember one point he was frantically calling for the ball and didn't get the pass and looked disappointed. I like that - wanting to get on the ball is a very good sign.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;what's wrong with ""black american"" if the ethnicity is important?

It ignores any ethnic difference between an African American, one descended from the slaves brought during the transatlantic slave trade, and any naturalised Caribbean or African immigrants or their kids. It lumps people who are not the exact same into one convenient group because people don't want to address one specific groups troubles.

Like I pointed out with sources, African academic attainment and that of the native African American population are *vastly* different, so lumping them into one group would only serve to A) hide the low attainment of African Americans and B) bring down the high attainment of African immigrants and their kids.

My cousins are black Americans, but they're also descended from Nigeria, the birthplace of their parents. They don't want to be lumped in as if they don't have a distinct heritage.

&gt; I mean we even discuss in that very sentence a Jamaican who would technically be an African American (given the continent of The Americas) 

Which means you're missing the point. Jamaica is a specific country with specific culture and history. A Jamaican wants to be an African American as much as a Scot wants to be English.",0,1408284817,null,0,false,0,cjsol7j,t3_2dobue,t1_cjsol7j,t1_cjs6mwe,null,1435451404,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,the_beees_knees,cnty-england,England,"I think you missunderstand the gateway argument so I will play devils advocate here.

Firstly, weed is incredibly profitable. Secondly, the gateway argument is based upon peoples mindsets about taking drugs. If you smoke cannabis and enjoy it, you are far more likely to be open to trying 'harder' drugs that you may also enjoy. Then having contacts with dealers it is easier to purchase them. How many people have you heard of or known whos first experience was a drug like MD? Not many.

The idea that dealers pressure people into harder drugs is simply not true for the vast majority of recreational users and the gateway argument doesn't address this IMO. There is unfortunately an underclass of very vunerabe people who fall prey to pressure from dealers but it is not the case for 99% of people.

&gt;I do not know of a single one who have ruined their lives as a result of pot usage

Then you are lucky. It is also a really vague point because you don't know what particular people could have achieved if they had spent their free time doing things other than getting high, in the case of heavy smokers.

true,ShadowOfTheWasp,null,null,"I use weed to stabilise my mood (diagnosed with severe depression plus others) and it does help, but also doesn't. Obviously it's a form of self-medication and as such isn't very scientific but when it does help it's very useful. My main gain from weed is a sense of perspective, it helps me realise that the depression isn't everything. A way in which it isn't helpful though is it being illegal, one of my other conditions is acute anxiety and even though weed is not a priority for law enforcement here I still get really nervous.

I have asked if I can be considered for treatment with psychedelics, I'd read about Ben Sessa's work, but nothing came of it. I'm very reluctant to go it alone as I did a lot of trips when I was younger and am worried about having a bad one on my own as I'm not convinced I could cope with that now. I've also considered travelling abroad for Ayahuasca therapy in S.America or psychedelic mushroom therapy in Thailand, both of which are being used to treat depression.

I can't believe I took 5 minutes out of my day to disprove something as retarded as this. Look at that image. Where do you see Lucas dealing with that run? How? Randomly cut inside of Lovren like a maniac who completely ignores all football sense. Or better yet. He should run around between Skrtel and Lovren just to pick up a RB who MIGHT be making a run inside the box. Instead, what anyone with half a footballing brain would suggest is that Johnson has the view of the whole thing. All he has to do is tuck in next to his CB instead of worrying about the guy on the right who provides no immediate danger.

If you want cheaper, you'll have to decide what you're prepared to compromise on, usually it's a choice between living space and location. 

The property rental market in Brighton and Hove is very competitive. Good deals go within a few days if being advertised. I'd advise you to set up email alerts with Zoopla and Prime Location and be ready to see flats on the day they are advertised. Also, take around £200 in cash with you so you can put down a 'holding deposit' as soon as you see one you like. 

*EDIT - Looks like Hangleton is not as bad as I remember it. I haven't been up there for a while, but my abiding memory of it is that my brother used to go there to score smack, which may have coloured my opinion of the place. Apologies to Hangletonians.

I was eligible for up to 10k loan, and chose 5k to finance a car and to boost my credit score).  I can't remember the interest rate but I was paying £171 per month over a three year period.

I always paid on time, and as my salary increased I ended up overpaying near the end of the loan term and cleared the debt in full this May, four months before the agreed end of loan term.

With no previous credit account or settled debt to my name, my credit score was hovering around 'Fair' for ages - neither good nor bad.  But I've been delighted to see it rise to 'Good' (this March) and finally 'Excellent' once I had paid the loan off in May.  This very week I've been accepted for a mortgage with a low interest rate, which is exactly what I was aiming for.

For young people who've never had a credit card and don't wish to, I think taking out a loan - as long as the repayments are affordable - can be a great way to gain a good credit history.  With credit cards it can sometimes be too enticing to spend too much as it's available, and just pay minimum payment.

Lucas can't ever start for us again.
Lovren is very good.
Manquillo had a promising debut
Moreno is our left back 
Sturridge needs support
Mignolet is the same as ever: great reflexes, rubbish everything else
Coutinho isn't as good as some think; talented but requires the entire team built around him otherwise he is poor
Sterling is amazing

* A Lucas &amp; Gerrard pivot is slow as molasses and provides no defensive cover. Can't start both of them.
* In response to above, Can better be all that and a bag of chips or our midfield will get bossed by good teams.
* We still suck defending from wide areas. Twice Clyne played a one-two on the edge of the box and twice Johnson/Lucas were nowhere to be found. I think I've seen lampposts more interested in tracking runs than Johnson. Flanagan has the same issue last year as well.
* Our pressing game works very well in the first half as we stifle and force them into errors but we looked gassed and uninterested coming out of halftime. Was the same in the friendly vs Utd.
* If Henderson gets injured/suspended, we are fucked.
* Coutinho has the killer through balls mastered but he still struggles against teams that play physical and press him.
* Having Lallana &amp; Markovic on the treatment table really hurt. We had nothing threatening attacking from the wings. Sterling is great but he preferers to cut inside or make diagonal runs behind the defence rather than stretch the field horizontally. Suarez did a great job of this last year, we'll have to see if Lallana &amp; Markovic can pick up the slack.
* Lambert is damn useful as a plan B/super-sub. I wouldn't be opposed to him getting some strats here and there as well but I would still like to see another forward in, now or in January.
* Lovren and Skrtel looked fine. Almost every dangerous attack from Southampton can be pinned more on the fullbacks/holding midfield than them.
* Migs: fantasic shot stopped but still flappy as fuck on set pieces

I'm sure i'm not the only one who went into that game expecting anything, despite my 2-1 prediction, but I never bet against Southampton.

The first 30 minutes or so were worrying, while it still wasn't a relegation threatened side, the side just didn't look hungry or convincing.

Obviously, that was all because of gelling, and new signings finding their feet, because after that I thought we were terrific, Tadic being the main guy for me, first 30m he looked uneventful, and not even a shade of what Lallana was, but then he suddenly woke up, had his tricks and turns, his balls were great most of the time, and was pivotal in the goal and most chances after.

JWP was another who impressed, although I felt the game wore him down a bit towards the end, to be expected, he is young and this is his first full season. He also had 3 chances on goal where he decided to pass as opposed to shooting, to which I thought all of the chances had a better chance if he took them, mainly the Davis attempt.

Pelle I thought was good, very quiet for the first 60m or so, but everyone needs time to settle in, and I can see him being a great asset to us.

Yoshida I'm still not convinced on, was pretty slow most of the game, wild headers out of the box, although he improved as the game went on, I wouldn't have fancied him if we weren't so pressing.

Schneiderlin was interesting, half the game he was up in their end creating havoc, the other half he seemed sloppy, giving balls away, or just not winning ones he should, but he hasn't been playing til last week, so it's to be expected.

Long I think was unlucky, he was extremely bright when he came on, creating pressure on the defenders, his header I can forgive, he had people coming onto him and he hadn't been in the game long, I can see him doing well for us.

Honorable mentions; Fonte, Bertrand and Wanyama were both solid, Clyne was usual Clyne after the first 30m, and he has had that goal coming for a while now, beauty.

All in all I'm highly impressed, that's about 220% better then I expected from our first game, and I'll admit I didn't expect us to look so creative going forward, can't wait to take on West Brom next week, it couldn't come sooner.",0,1408286589,null,0,false,0,cjsp9bh,t3_2dsuta,t1_cjsp9bh,t3_2dsuta,null,1435282633,18,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,18

true,Jack_the_lionheart,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt; The Type 45 destroyer is equipped with the sophisticated Sea Viper (PAAMS) air-defence system utilizing the SAMPSON active electronically scanned array multi-function radar and the S1850M long-range radar. The PAAMS system is able to track over 2,000 targets and simultaneously control and coordinate multiple missiles in the air at once, allowing a large number of tracks to be intercepted and destroyed at any given time. This makes the PAAMS system particularly difficult to swamp during a saturation attack, even against supersonic targets.[37] The US Naval War College has suggested that the SAMPSON radar is capable of tracking 1,000 objects the size of a cricket ball travelling at three times the speed of sound (Mach 3), emphasising the system's capabilities against high performance stealth targets.

Just to prove that the defence does exist, and is highly impressive. 

Not to get into a long debate but what you've suggested is a defensive force which has only the capabilities to defend us if the enemy is at the gates, and should that be the situation then the world as we know it is already over. Having a blue water navy is the only way to project force on a global stage and it is that ability that allows us to act in our defence before the threat is already upon us. 

Don't take this as me saying anything about our affairs in the middle east and whether that truly is in our defence or not, that's politics and this is about our force projection capabilities. It's easy to say there is no threat to us in the world, there's been no major global conflict since WWII and thus the MoD is oversized. But geopolitics are always in flux and we never know when force will be needed, just look at Ukraine/ Crimea; a year ago would you even think what's happened there would even be a possibility?

Go to the pre-match and line-up threads and see how many people think Lucas will ""add some defensive steel"" to our midfield. There's no ""Lucas is bad"" circlejerk; plenty of people here don't think he should be sold this window. 

The ball by Tadic is a good ball, but good balls like that get played all the time without resulting in goals. If Lucas was actually occupied by another player, then fair enough, he doesn't track Clyne and someone else should. But the fact is, he's not doing anything and *is* ball-watching.

Thoughts on some of the players:

Pelle was ok, I'm not ready to make a call on him yet but he managed to link up quite well at times but never really looked like scoring.

Tadic was hot and cold for me, looked great at times but was a little frustrating as well. Needed to do better with some of his crossing but besides that looks very promising.

JWP was ball shy to begin with and getting out-muscled a fair bit but grew into the game really well. His dead ball stuff was exceptional as usual. He's still young but once his confidence is up he's a great player, if he can bulk out a bit too even better.

Wanyama was fucking immense.

Schneiderlin was pretty flat footed for me, seemed a bit casual with the ball at times and wasn't as committed in tackles as I'm used to. Hopefully it's just a first game back thing and not an indication of a general attitude problem.

Thought Bertrand and Clyne were great going forward, Clyne was sometimes caught out with his defensive positioning but tbh he was having to deal with Sterling all day so not exactly a surprise.

Yoshida is still prone to chasing the ball like a puppy at times and getting himself caught out but he was not bad today.

true,youngmonie,null,null,"Tough loss, but this team is looking very promising. Playing some high pressing football, with both fullbacks bombing forward with the attack. Though this can lead to us being caught out, as with the first goal, with Clyne being caught too far forward and not moving back soon enough.

Ward-Prowse is playing a lot higher up the pitch, and hasn’t seemed to settle into the role yet. Link up play through the middle is a bit disconnected. On set pieces, JWP is wrecking havoc on Liverpool, putting a lot of whip on the ball. Good start by him.

Tadic. Wow. Amazing debut by him. Playing in some great balls and looks like a real threat. Really took it to Manquillo on the left side. Great assist on the goal to Clyne. Almost had an identical one moments later. Feeds the ball well into the middle.

Pelle seemed to disappear. His runs were always a fraction of a second too late, and were always picked up by Lovren and Skertl. His height wasn’t taken advantage of well, with balls coming in pretty low. Not on the same wavelength as JWP, with Pelle making runs in a different direction than JWP anticipated.

Centrebacks look like a liability right now. Both are guilty of ball watching which leads to them not picking up runs. Some bad touches/clearances. Yoshida has been caught out of position a couple of times. He also just watched the ball on the second goal from the cross in, to the header, and into the back of the net. 

Wanyama and Schneiderlin are playing well as holding midfielders, picking up danger and tracking back to help defend. May be forced to do so because of the two centre backs. However, this leads to an immense amount of space between these two and JWP through the middle, missing that link up.

Tadic looked very dangerous everytime he got the ball, he looks like an assist machine in the waiting, like Ozil but 30m cheaper. I have put him straight into my fantasy team based on that performance, looked a little tired towards the end, hope he can play 90 minutes regularily because we need him.

Pelle looked alittle ""slow"" most of the time and didn't seem to react quick enough when he had the ball, maybe he is used to having more time ? He got better as the game when on and hopefully his adjustment period is short.

James was pretty good in the middle, he needs to drink some protein shakes though because he is pushed off the ball too easily. Set pieces / corners were Beckham like as usual. Man Utd to buy him next summer if he plays all season I reckon.

Big Vic was solid at the back, he is like a wall and you can't ever beat him in a shoulder duel. Sometimes I wonder why he isn't a central defender, especially after his shot in the first half.

I agree with /u/Theskain about Schneiderlin, his interest in the game seem to grow and decline every so often. It would have been so much better for him mentally if that shot hadn't hit the crossbar. Hopefully he realises that sulking and not playing well is the worse way to get better teams interested in him if thats what his heart desires.

Long didn't have much time, should really have put that header on target but you can't score everytime. Hopefully he starts more games so he can run himself out over 75 mins then come off, I think hes wasted on the bench with all that energy

Clyne looked dangerous everytime he got the ball, very fast, took people on and had them alot of them the time. Solid at the back also and some great crosses. Goal was just amazing.

Wish I could say the same for bertrand, he looked alright but for a full back he doesn't have alot of pace. Seemed average defensively, will give him more time.

Fonte was solid most of the time, both centre backs ball watched so hard for the second goal. Yoshida was better than expected but still sometimes you get nerves when the ball is near him. Hopefully we can get the new guy fit in 4 weeks before we leak too many goals. I can see defence being our weakness this season.

Solid performances from everyone else I haven't mentioned.

I would have brought Taider on for S Davis around 60 mins instead of taking Tadic off. I think he would have brought the game to Liverpool more.

Well, that's my point, isn't it? You're focusing on when the ball is played, when the move starts before that, as soon as Clyne releases the ball and starts his run. If Lucas tracks his run then - because he's the one best placed to - then suddenly Lucas isn't out of position when Tadic's ball is played. Then it doesn't matter that the ball takes 3 Liverpool players out of play, because the Southampton player trying to get on the end of it is still covered.

As for why those players didn't close down the space - as I've said repeatedly, I think you're overestimating how much ground they could cover.

true,AboveAllBeKind,null,null,"Disclosure: I'm doing some press work for Beat Carnival; been involved with them for about 10 years now (as a drummer in their samba band BEATnDRUM) and want to help raise the profile beyond Beat's core audience. 

It's a cross-community arts charity set up to bring people together through carnival arts; samba was the main art form on the music front as it didn't belong to either 'side' here. In recent years, Beat's brought Ulster Scots and Irish trad drummers together for performances (with the 'Big Drums' project, people made big lambegs and bodhrans in the carnival warehouse on Peter's Hill, to be used in cross-community performances), tho' the mainstay is still afro-Brazilian, with samba, reggae, DnB, hip-hop all in there. Best craic ever and I've had some great festival and event experience from being involved, which has been amazing.

Beat work with community groups and schools across Belfast in producing these events, as well as professional musicians and artists. (Beat also produced this year's St Patrick's Day parade for Belfast City Council; like all Beat events, it worked with community groups from unionist/nationalist areas to create the parade. Don't think that was fully understood at the time...)

Last year, Beat were partners with arts organisations in France, Portugal and South Africa in the 'Urban Ballet' project, which was all about international collaboration and opportunities for people of all backgrounds to get involved in the arts. The Urban Ballet performance on Culture Night was the finale of that international project - this year, Beat's doing it again but with more performers; adding music and lyrics written by Katie Richardson and performed by a Beat Street Choir and Carnival Band, as well as the hundreds of drummers playing Brazilian drums and hundreds of dancers performing the hip-hop choreography. 

Beat's still recruiting singers and dancers - no previous experience required and tuition is free. Any of you fancy getting involved..? :)",0,1408287645,null,0,1408303324,0,cjspocc,t3_2dsvva,t1_cjspocc,t3_2dsvva,null,1435282957,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

true,196884,null,null,"Quick thoughts :

Ugh, that was a tough game to watch. BR got it wrong. We play 4-2-3-1 with SG-Lucas in the double pivot, henderson/sterling wide, coutinho in the middle. Their orders are suppose to be ""stay compact in the middle"" and cede the far wide areas to the wingbacks Manquillo and GJ. But we never got going because of several things :

(1) Soton knew that's what we are going to play, and came up with a gameplan : compress the ""10"" area (Coutinho's, who had no joy all game -- more later), and pack the midfield. They don't mind a mud-fest in the middle -- as long as we don't get our silky passing engine going they are happy. They did this job brilliantly.

(2) Lucas-SG double pivot : Both play well, but they are playing in the wrong system (BR's fault). Lucas and SG is playing in the same space. SG wants to be more forward looking (probably BR's instructions), and Lucas is suppose to cover for SG. But the problem is that SG stayed too deep, and cede the middle too much -- probably because it was too compressed with all the packed Soton players -- and Lucas started to not know where his spot is.  Not SG-Lucas fault -- they are playing in a wrong system.

(3) Coutinho-Sterling-Henderson -- with overlapping fullbacks, Soton packing the midfield, we have at least 10 players from both teams fighting the same space. In principle it might work, but with so many players in that space, Henderson drifted further and further wide, isolating Coutinho (who was double/triple tagged). Now, if Henderson is closer to the middle, he gets the space those Soton taggers cede. But Henderson is out wide...so our attack through Coutinho is stifled....which leads to...

(4) Studge getting no service at all, so he was peripheral until BR (to his credit) realizes that his 4-2-3-1 is not working so....

(5) He took out Lucas (who is probably hard-done by it, becuase he played well in a bad system), and put in Allen, switched to 4-3-3. Allen brings in physicality for the hand-to-hand midfield combat occuring, which makes more space for Henderson to play with. Coutinho starts getting a bit more of the ball and space, and we started to stem the Soton tide (which is caused by us unable to retain possession in their half). Finally...

(6) BR acknowledges that we are getting outfought, so he took out Coutinho and put in Lambert, put Sterling in the #10 (a totally different beast to double team on, and who needs less space to be effective). Immediately, we started to retain the ball, and attack better. We got the goal.

Defensively -- we were organized at the back with Lovren playing really well. I am loving this guy already. He anticipates, reads the game, and step forward when needed to. But....

Midfield is letting our defenders down not tracking runners. Clyne's goal was a brilliant piece of backheel (which has Johnson and Lucas ball watching) by Tadic. But Clyne shouldn't have been allowed to run in *at all* -- he got a free shot. This is a lot of our issues last season, looks like we are going to be facing this issue again. [EDIT : after watching the Clyne goal again, Clyne was SG's man...]

Asides : 

Manquillo looks good -- strong in 1 vs 1, and reads the game very well. 

Johnson's time here is numbered. Loses the ball and putting us under pressure too often.

He was always available for a pass and made some quality tackles and clearances. He always tracked back and put himself in quality positions.

But god forbid he mis-controls a pass or has a bad dribble. All of a sudden he's a scape goat for the Holocaust and the burning of witches in colonial America.

Here I will provide images to help my point. Hopefully you will go into depth as well as to helping me understand how one tracks that run as Lucas 


http://imgur.com/YZUKupk,wPUgSso,zpcAOis

Here Lucas is watching the ball played from Clyne go to Tadic. His first thought as a CDM should be to help Lovren in case he gets turned and to block any ball the might go through the middle. 

http://imgur.com/YZUKupk,wPUgSso,zpcAOis#1

Here he is making that run to close down the space in the middle for any possible balls to be played through and coming close to Lovren to help him deal with the situation. Notice he no longer has vision of where Clyne is or what run he will be making.

http://imgur.com/YZUKupk,wPUgSso,zpcAOis#2

Here he is standing in the perfect position to stop the ball being played through the middle (where the black line is) and at the same time putting pressure on Tadic and helping Lovren. 

http://imgur.com/ddEPh6O

And finally at this point when the ball is played Lucas actually sees where Clyne is. At this point it is too late.

If anything, Lucas had a job to do and was doing it. Gerrard, Skrtel and Johnson were doing nothing but watching. That's what ball watching is.

So I want to know how, if you were Lucas, you track Clyne's run. How do you anticipate where Tadic is going to play the ball, all whilst doing your duties of helping your CBs and controlling your part of the field. Please help me understand. Thank you.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Independence and meaningful devolution has its downsides. We tend not to focus on them as much, but they are definitely there.

Take a richer region. They have richer people, so spend less on services. If you devolve responsibilities for taxes and services to them and don't force them to pool it with the poorer regions, they can cut their taxes but still improve services as more money is allocated. As a consequence, they are much more likely to end up having lower tax rates but high quality schools. At the same time, poor areas which no longer have access to the amount of money coming in from the wealthier areas will have to increase their taxes and likely face worse schools and hospitals as a consequence. 

The result? Rich people richer, poor people poorer, and capital flight as the richer people in the poorer region move to the rich region which has better services but lower taxes. This happens a massive amount in the United States and is the reason why rich areas have near British public school quality state schools while poor areas have really, really bad ones. Even the nice, fluffy, liberal areas of the US are exceptionally dickish about things like reforming spending because no matter how liberal and progressive you are when it comes down to your kids getting a good education nothing else matters.

Granted, this happens under the status quo, but it will happen more and have greater impact. At the moment with the UK we have a large tax base and relatively minimal local tax raising powers, but even now there are real problems when a Conservative government can reduce community spending at little political cost to them at a disproportionate rate to poorer areas.

For the record, I am a Tory who lives in one of the wealther areas, so I would be absolutely fine with independence for the Southeast of England.

How are you blaming Lucas more than Skrtel in this situation? It baffles me! Lucas was doing his job, Skrtel was clearly not.

Personally, I'd still say tracking Clyne's run was more important. When I'm playing CDM, I see my priority as being to track runners from midfield. At the point of your first image, which is when Clyne makes that pass to Tadic, Lucas is in a position to follow Clyne's run.

As for what the others are doing - I don't think Johnson could've gotten across fast enough, nor Gerrard. And Gerrard does have Ward-Prowse to deal with.

Think of features or sections that can help break a Podcast up and generate good discussion. For instance a young 'un of the week could be a discussion of promising youngster coming through or a section about the best r/Everton comments.

Get a decent microphone, Skype is easy way to get a large group and audacity is fine for recording and editing, but that will mean nothing with pops and hisses that your laptop microphone will give.

Building a podcast for the sub-reddit is a great idea, as I personally think that the plenty of Everton podcasts and shows that exist cover all things Everton brilliantly, but one that covers the big things while engaging (sorry for wanky term) with the sub would be original and have a built in audience.

Rather, they demonstrate that Scotland would be in a strong position to assert itself as fitting into the EU. It's not a tiny tinpot republic trying to muscle itself into a relationship with major world players it has no commonalities with. In becoming a member, Scotland would instantly have middling-to-respectable rankings amongst the member states in every regard. Because Scotland is currently a part of an EU member state, it is already compliant with most EU requirements of membership.

&gt;__Coca-Cola Freestyle__ is a [touch screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_screen) [soda fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_fountain) introduced by [The Coca-Cola Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company) in 2009. The machine features over 125    different Coca-Cola drink products,  and custom flavors.  The machine allows users to select from mixtures of flavors of Coca-Cola branded products which are then individually dispensed. The machines are currently located in major Coca-Cola partners and retail locations as a part of a gradual and ongoing deployment. Most machines have Pibb Xtra or Pibb Zero, although some have Dr Pepper or Diet Dr Pepper. The machines have faced some consumer complaints due to long lines as a result of extra time it takes for consumers to decide on a product to dispense.

People might have deluded ideas about what is necessary for peace at the moment; at least some on both sides want to eliminate the other and this is spurred on by religious-ideological demagoguery.

For comparison, in the South West it was 52.4% for the right wing parties, barely any more. 

Northern England is not as left wing as you think it is, nor is it as pro-Europe.

true,PirateMud,,San Miguel | Drinks away from the pool table!,"Fiesta in Menorca, last year. Go out on the first night, dance to samba drums until about 3am when they go into a club. I dive into another club for a slash. As I leave a cute hippy friend who doesn't speak a whole lot of English was walking past, and so I go to another club with her. Leave there at about 7am. Walking out of the club area there's a dude selling homemade nibbles. I have 3 and somehow don't pay. I'd been dancing for 8 hours I was *hungry*.

Yeah. Full of weed. I get to my mum's, have a chat with her, she makes me go to bed. I puke in my sleep, waking my mate up (not the hippy, one I took over from England) who'd got to bed by 2. She wants to be a paramedic but can't handle the vom so she gets my mum to sort me out.

Anyway I spend the next 2 days feeling like I've died. It was a horrendous hangover and ruined the rest of the fiesta for me. Alas.

OOH. How about the year before when I got in on the last night of the fiesta at 4.30am, had 2 hours sleep, had no time to shower before going to the airport and getting on the plane as the hangover came in? I then felt like I got drunk again on my own BAC as I went to higher altitude! I was sitting on this plane next to a young lady and her infant child and I *stank* of horses, dust, sweat, and booze.

* When Yaya is not on his game it's like playing with 10 men. Yes he did set up Dzeko's assist with a great lofted ball but that was the only noteworthy thing he did today. Still early so if he can shake off the rustyness we should be ready to go, it just makes Fernando's performance all that more impressive!

* Fernando had an absolute cracker of a game! So many crunching and crucial tackles. He stopped that dangerous Newcastle break away with a magnificent sliding tackle and his last ditch block deflected Ayoze certain goal just inches away from the goal. In addition to that he was a defensive wall all over the pitch and already seems to be more dynamic than Javi in his speed and his ability to impose himself! 

* Im really quite amazed how adept clichy was as a makeshift RB, was exceptionally solid today and had a couple of bale-esque runs down the touchline

* Samir Nasri needs to be more Direct and incisive because he just recycled possession today. He needs to be more brave and penetrative with his passing and runs, no end product from him. Hopefully he can work on that later this season

* Dzeko was absolutely immense today! all credit to him, he's worked on his creativity and hold up play and it shows! the way he held onto the ball while under intense pressure to lay it off into space was just astounding and his creativity in that back heel assist was superb!

* Demichelis had a sloppy game today. Made some good no nonsense clearances but he was constantly caught out of position and left behind, he seemed to talk the game at half pace and that lazy pass back to Joe Hart almost gave me a heart attack. Hopefully he gets back into his stride and shows his later last season form again, though i would be lying if i was looking forward to getting Mangala on the pitch; he seems to excel in everything we lacked in defence today; speed, strength, aerial ability and positioning.

* Kompany was solid as usual, cant find any faults in his game today and was unlucky to pick up a yellow for essentially standing still. 

* Jovetic was very rusty and frustrating today. He's obviously hungry to prove himself, unfortunantly this leads to him snatching at chances and poor decision making, killed a couple of good moves because of this. Hoping he gets back into form soon.

* Silva was silky silva as usual and happy to see him get the opener, if im not mistaken he got the opener against Newcastle last season too (?), unless it was yaya with his free kick.

* Aguero was only had 5 touches and 2 where shots and one of those shots was a goal-(via bbc). Vintage aguero and hopefully he stays healthy and hungry. Cant wait to see him against Liverpool!

(What motherboard, graphics card, memory, cpu, heatsink/fan, hard drives, Power supply Unit)



The diagnosis may be more costly than it's worth, especially if it's an intermittent issue or an odd failure. A new component may be the only requirement. **BUT** a new component may actually be a temporary fix as the reason for component failure is sometimes hard to find and usually just assumed to be the fault of the component. 

Eg... 

* Your hard drive fails. Get new hard drive. Fixed..... until it fails too. (£60 HD and diagnosis/fix cost gone)

* Your ram fails. Get new ram. Fixed..... until it fails too. (£100 ram and diagnostics/fix costs gone)

Both could be the fault of a dodgy PSU in combination with your home power being ""spikey"". [A Surge Protected Extension Lead would be your real fix.](http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/computing-accessories/accessories-and-bags/power-cables/surge-protectors/masterplug-4-socket-surge-protected-extension-cable-2m-00772890-pdt.html). Both could also be the fault of the motherboard. To actually find the root cause will not happen 99% of the time. It costs too much time. It may take a week of use before the fault arises again after fitting a new component.

Need to know how much cash you have to fix it, along with the actual existing components. At a certain point, you can clearly say what is not an issue, and that it would be cheaper to get completely new components that just ""could be"" the issue.... motherboard and psu for example.

I once had neighbours who made horrific noise all through the night.  Rave music etc.  I couldn't sleep.  I simply called the council and told them and they came round when it was happening with a recording device, they record how loud the noise is so they have proof. 

Then an order (ASBO or equivalent) can be given relating to noise levels and a maximum level they may reach.  Any violation can be met with a fine so I was told.

Also they had the ability to take away means of causing noise (CD player/TV/whatever)

He was asked by BR to play in the ""2"" in a double pivot, which didn't work and it's *not his fucking fault*. He did what he was told to do -- cover for SG when SG goes up. Yes, he is not the fastest player in the game, but that's not his strength. If anything he played well in the game -- cleaned up the mess that was the hand-to-hand combat in the super packed midfield.

The Clyne goal was SG's fault. Lovren had Tadic under pressured and turned away from goal, and Clyne was running into the space behind Lovren. Either SG and Lucas need to track that run. Lucas was closer to Lovren/Tadic, and he went to put more pressure on Tadic (one might argue that Tadic is already covered so that's unnecessary), but SG was the *free man*. Instead, SG strolled, watched Clyne runs behind and Tadic backheels taking out both Lovren and Lucas.

Lucas is never going to be SG. He might not be the player that our system needs, but he didn't play badly. In fact, he plays very well today and he will feel harddone by being the person who has to make way for Allen because BR needs to fix his broken 4-2-3-1 into a 4-3-3.",0,1408296550,null,0,false,0,cjstldh,t3_2dsxdq,t1_cjstldh,t3_2dsxdq,null,1435285096,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

It's being told to leave a student hall because people object to the fact that your food is labelled in Hebrew. On social media it's the fact that hashtags like HitlerWasRight and KillJews have been trending on Twitter. It's the fact that in the last month a Rabbi in Gateshead has been attacked and in Belfast bricks were thrown through a Synagogue window. It's the fact that after a Pro-Palestinian rally in Manchester, protesters drove through a Jewish area shouting ""Heil Hitler"". It's when a Rabbi is walking home in north London and people shout ""free Palestine, fuck the Zionists, fuck the Jews"" and ""Allahu Akhbar!"" at him. It's the fact that in the last few months anti-Semitic incidents like this have increased hugely. And everyone shrugs and says that it's regrettable, but people are right to be angry about Israel.

I have plenty of Muslim friends. Over the last decade I've remained friends with them. When Muslim terrorists blew up bombs on buses and trains in London, I didn't ask them to justify their religion and publicly disown Islam. When Muslims in Iraq started killing great swathes of Christians and Yazidi, I didn't start calling my Muslim colleagues Islamist scum or ask them to stop eating any food labelled in Arabic. When I discovered that some Muslim colleagues hadn't publicly disowned the Assad regime that was responsible for killing tens of thousands of civlians, I didn't ask them to leave my presence. When I find out someone is Muslim I don't spit at them or insult them. When Syria (a Muslim country) started shelling its own civilians, I didn't drive the Muslim parts of London shouting abuse at them and calling for the death of Muslims. When I discover that friends of mine regularly visit their family in Pakistan, I don't hate them, despite the fact that Pakistan has been involved in more war, more bloodshed and hundreds of thousands more civilian deaths than Israel ever has. Because much as I dislike Islamist terrorism and much as I loathe states such as Pakistan, Syria and countless other regimes, I don't hold Muslims in Britain responsible for them, and I don't expect Muslims to suddenly abandon their culture (writing in Arabic, wearing Islamic dress, going to mosque, visiting Pakistan or Saudi Arabia) simply because people on the other side of the world are doing things I disagree with.",0,1408297942,null,0,false,0,cjsu8id,t3_2dmu1r,t1_cjsu8id,t1_cjsswtw,null,1435285400,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Has he genuinely improved from last season?  Can't say for sure, but early evidence suggests that he has.  A month of Pochettino's coaching is nothing to sniff at -- that one of the main reasons we got Poch, isn't it?

true,the_oncoming_storm,cnty-scotland,The Glorious Kingdom of Fife,"&gt; Yes, because I'm sick of subsiding free prescription charges and free/reduced University tuition for Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland when - if they were on their own - they wouldn't be able to afford it.

You know that's not how it works, right? 

While spending in Scotland is currently higher than the UK average, the difference in average tax receipts (inc. geographical share of oil) outweighs this difference in spending. 

[Analysis from Professor Brian Ashcroft](http://www.scottisheconomywatch.com/brian-ashcrofts-scottish/2013/07/has-scotland-already-spent-its-oil-fund.html) suggests over the past 32 years:

&gt; the total value of tax receipts is £1,425 billion while the total value of public spending in and for Scotland is £1,440 billion.

That's a £15 billion debt over the period. Somewhat less than Scotland's population share of UK debt (£140 billion).  And where does that money come from? Borrowing - it's not a subsidy from other parts of the UK.

However, part of Scotland's spend over those years includes interest payments for a population share of UK debt resulting from spend in the rest of the UK (it's also most of our current deficit). So if you also account for that: 

&gt; I estimate that Scotland’s share of UK debt interest amounted to £83 billion at 2001-12 prices. Subtracting this from total estimated Scottish spend of £1,440 billion we get a debt interest adjusted estimate of spend of £1,357 billion. This means that Scotland was in overall surplus by about £68 billion“.

So there you go. Hopefully you can take that chip off your shoulder and do something useful with it (like deep fry it...).

true,eddy_butler,null,null,"Quick rundown for those unable to make the game:

With Watford down to 10 men (it did look like a red card from where I was sat) it's hard to say how well we played and how influential a 3rd minute red card is. 

I thought we looked patient in our build up play and Johnson and Tettey completely controlled the centre of the field with Hoolahan acting in a pivotal role just in front of them. We stretched Watford well with some smart passing and regularly switched the play to make them work hard. This paid dividends in the second half where we took control of the game as they started to noticeably tire more and more. 

Our ball retention was definitely the major positive from the game and I hope we continue to play Johnson and Tettey in DM roles. However, our final product in both the crossing and shooting department was sub-par and frustrating for large parts of the games. Despite creating space in the final third, we squandered numerous chances with wasteful and hopeful shots and some very misguided crosses (Redmond, Garrido and Whittaker were some of the main culprits). 

1. Ruddy - Not much to do, but made a couple of important saves when he was called upon
2. Whittaker - Looked competent in defence but reticent going forward. Should prove to be a decent Championship player.
3. Garrido - Looked to be the weakest link in the side and was regularly caught out of position (as with the Wolves game as well). Was not helped by Hoolahon straying into the centre of the park as it left him particularly expose.
4. Turner - Looks a bit flat-footed at times, but his positioning makes up for it. His experience may be invaluable in this competitive league.
5. Martin - Another confident and consistent performance from Russy. May be culpable in the air at centre back, but was confident on the ball and organised the defence well.
6. Johnson - Great performance, calmly controlled the midfield with Tettey and Hoolahon and got his reward with a sweet finish
7. Redmond - Exciting when he's on the ball, but offers nothing in defence and snatches at shots and crosses. Definitely has potential, but his game needs some refinement. 
8. Tettey - One of the unsung heroes in this team. Works his socks off in defence and clearly knows how to strike a ball as well. Hopefully he gets the game time his talent warrants.
9. Lafferty - I was sceptical when we signed him, but he put in a good shift and looked lively, linking well with Hoolahan particularly. Gives us an aerial option as well (which we didn't see yesterday, but may well in the future).
10. Grabban - Reminds me of Simeon Jackson. An instinctual striker that will undoubtedly bag some goals in the Championship but looks like he might be out-muscled at times and would struggle in the top tier.
11. Hoolahan - Started out wide, but worked his way into the centre as the game wore on. Looked confident and exciting on the ball and offers a bit more flair than Howson going forward. An invaluable asset for our team if we can provide him with space in front of opponents' back four, which he showed yesterday.

Positive stuff and a great confidence booster, but that red card made it very easy for us. Blackburn on Tuesday will provide a greater challenge and a win there could send us well on the way to a successful campaign.

**Carlos Vela**: http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/carlos-vela/leistungsdaten/spieler/35773/saison/2013

Vela didn't do so well in the Prem with Arsenal as a kid but has improved massively since especially in the last two seasons forming a dangerous partnership with Griezmann. 14 goals &amp; 12 assists in 37 games in 12/13 then 21 goals &amp; 14 assists in 52 games last year. 

He has bulked up significantly since leaving Arsenal and would not be bullied in the Prem. He prefers to attack from the right flank but can play just as well down the middle. He would also give us balance as a left footer while his link play and skill level are excellent. 

Looking at the Squawka stats he created nearly twice as many chances as the others on this list last season though he did play the most mins. He nearly created as many as Suarez did! At 25 he is an experienced pro but not too old to suggest he's reached his peak. Current value is probably approx. 20m Euros.


**Kevin Volland**: http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/kevin-volland/leistungsdaten/spieler/82009/saison/2013

Volland was a bit unlucky not to make the WC with Germany whom he has only played for twice. With Klose retiring there should be more chances for the likes of him now. He has had two solid yet unspectacular seasons with Hoffenheim (6 goals, 12 assists then 12 goals, 9 assists) mainly playing on the right of a front three with Modeste or Schipplock as the central striker and Firmino playing in the hole.

He is 5'10 tall but has a strong physique and like Vela I know he wouldn't find the physicality of the Prem an issue. He also has decent pace and a good left foot and at 22 has many years to improve. I've also noticed he is always one to track back and help his fullback, something BR loves in his wide men. Current value is probably approx. 20m Euros.


**Carlos Bacca**: http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/carlos-bacca/leistungsdaten/spieler/119235/saison/2013

Bacca posted 21 goals/12 assists in his first season with Sevilla after a great season with Brugge (in the weaker Belgian Jupiter League) where he tallied 28 goals and 12 assists in. With Colombia having such great options up front he only has 10 caps at age 27. We won't hold that against him!

Bacca is an out and out striker and not one to play wide. He is a pure poacher, almost a classic centre-forward i.e. physical, holds the ball up strongly, links the play yet also sets up team-mates well. 

A negative is he likes to lurk on the shoulder of the last defender and as such gets caught offside a bit too much. Also he only turned pro at age 23! He is very much a 'young 27' with nowhere near as many previous apps behind him as most other players his age. He is something of a wild card choice and was last linked with Everton and Newcastle for approx. 10m Euros. Transfermarkt value him at £12m.


**Alexandre Lacazette**: http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/alexandre-lacazette/leistungsdaten/spieler/93720/saison/2013

Lacazette is aged 23 and managed 22 goals/8 assists last season which was by far his best to date and has earned him links with both LFC and Newcastle. 

I must confess to only seeing him play a handful of times, I don't think I even saw him score. From what I've read/seen he's quite short, very quick and skilful, technically good, two footed (favours his right) and loves to dribble and beat his man. Current value is about 15m Euros I think. 

**Mattia Destro**: http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/mattia-destro/leistungsdaten/spieler/88683/saison/2013

Destro had something of a breakthrough season with 13 league goals in 20 games while missing 14 matches through a knee injury and being suspended for 4 others. He had 11 goals the season before but 5 of those were in the Coppa Italia. 

Injuries are the main worry for him seeing as he's had so many already in his young career. When I've seen him play he tends to be a lone striker and has lead the line well. I was fortunate to see him score a fine hat-trick late last season though this was the game he infamously punched an opponent (Astori who is now his team-mate!) and received a 3 match suspension for it.

He is currently being linked with a bizarre swop deal seeing Soldado head to Roma and Destro sign for Spurs. That makes no sense at all. Current value is probably around the 20m Euro mark.


Others I looked at were Heung-Ming Son, Alessio Cerci, Roberto Firmino and Domenico Berardi.

**Cerci** is a 27 year old winger coming off an excellent season with Torino where he produced 13 goals and 12 assists. He is being linkied with a 20m Euro move to Atletico Madrid though Milan are also chasing him. Probably not worth us pursuing him.

**Berardi** is only 18 and came to my attention in a Serie A game last season where he scored 4 times v Milan for minnows Sassuolo. He had 16 goals/9 assists overall. I since found out he's there on loan from Juve and thus probably only available to us on loan. At his young age he's probably a no go. We already have another very young striker headed to Anfield next season in Origi.

**Son** is a big favourite on here and impressed me playing for Leverkusen last season where he managed 12 goals and 7 assists playing usually as a support striker/inside right behind Kiesling. He is full of talent yet less polished than the likes of Destro, Lacazette or Volland hence why he didn't make my five man shortlist. His price would probably be around 15m Euros. Should we sign him i'm sure he would fit into our playstyle well. I just don't know if he could be the goalscorer we need.

**Firmino** is a CAM or attacking mid so not the striker we lack yet he proved himself an impressive goal threat playing behind Volland at Hoffenheim last season. 16 goals and 12 assists was not enough to earn a place on Scolari's WC squad. We all know how that worked out. 

So signing him may displace our own brilliant Brazilian #10 Coutinho. Firmino has played all across the front for Hoffenheim even as a CF and I think he could be most effective in a support striker role behind Sturridge. However, we already have Sterling to play that role. Lallana also could do it, as could Coutinho. 

But for argument's sake if we compare Coutinho/Firmino. Both have everything you would want from a classic '10 i.e. skill, vision, flair and creativity in abundance plus the ability to beat a man via a trick or dribble. Where Firmino has the edge is his superior strength and his finishing ability. He finishes chances like a good striker whereas Couts lacks that quality in front of goal at times. I do however expect Phillipe to improve that facet of his game this season. Firmino would probably cost again approx. 20m Euros. 


**My order of preference**:

* Vela
* Lacazette
* Firmino (not a striker)
* Volland
* Bacca
* Destro

I think Can's physical ability was sorely lacking v Wanyama. He dominated the midfield in the 2nd half especially. I kept waiting for BR to do something, his solution was to bring on Allen who tried hard and certainly did better than Lucas but I still feel Can would have been a wiser choice. 

Can is more positive than Lucas and has shown he's effective when running with the ball and powering past people. Lucas can't do that. I think if Lucas is to play it must be when Gerrard is rested.

* [60 Million total deaths throughout the world.](http://i.imgur.com/yH9EKwc.png)  

* All deaths measured by country.

* [January 1933, some **522,000** Jews lived in Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Germany)

* [approximately 11 million people were killed during the Holocaust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust)

**The Holocaust refers to an eight year period.**  

I can see where the conspiracy comes from but it's wrong. 

The war wasn't about exterminating Jews. It did turn into it though, in vast parts due to the dehumanization and hate that had been ongoing since before the war. Killing had also become part of the norm, along with forced labour and mass imprisoning.  Jews were one of the ""enemies"" to put in camps to work or imprison.... then after escalation of that method.... to be killed as it's easier than imprisoning. 

The problem is that the Holocaust is used as a word to imply that it was an intentional extermination effort of all jews from the world. It was sectarianism within a brutal war. 

**Poland:** 6.0 million total; 3.0 million Jews, 2.0 million ethnic Poles, and 1.0 million Polish citizens died

**death camp** Polish research estimated the Nazi death camp toll at 2,830,000; including 1,860,000 Polish Jews

**Forced labour in Germany** Poles and Russians who were viewed as racially inferior, were subjected to intensified discriminatory measures. They were forced to wear identifying purple tags with ""P""s sewn to their clothing. (you can see where that was going if Germany had their way)


**The Holocaust was real.** But it is misrepresented quite a bit by the numbers and lack of context behind them. Forced labour camps was what a lot of invading armies done. In March 1947, an estimated 4,000,000 Germans were being used as forced labour

* Great Britain used 225,000 Germans as ""reparations labor""

* U.S. used over 500,000 German POWs in Germany in Military Labor Service Units.

* France demanded 1,700,000 POWs for use as ""enforced labor""

The context is important. It was a time when the ""enemy"" was imprisoned in ""camps"" and forced to do stuff.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labor_of_Germans_after_World_War_II

The course exposes you to many more statistical techniques and gives you a chance to work with some really good people. The careers service is constantly emailing with various job fairs. Many of my friends who decided research wasn't for them very quickly found jobs. In terms of the cons, the MPhil is only 9 months, vs. 12 months in other unis. It can be quite intense with the essay deadlines, your thesis, building a relationship with your supervisor and balancing time between college and department. In many ways, I found it quite taxing straight after my undergraduate. But it was good prep for a PhD. When making postgraduate plans, you may want to consider: (1) Am I really interested in research, to the extent that I want to pursue a PhD? (2) Regardless of interest in PhD, how would an MPhil help my career plans?

Some things to take away (for me):  

* Deserved at least a point, possibly should have won.  

+ Davis should have scored when he was 1v1.  

- Both reporters fishing for gossip on Schneiderlin.  

* Played well, hopefully dispelled some people's belief that we are a club close to collapse.  

+ When asked how what he thought of our new players, especially Pelle and Tadic, didn't gush, and just said ""they did OK, they have no seen the pace and will have to get used to it"" etc. Good answer, no excuses.  

- He has never believed we'd be near relegation.  

* The way he says ""half"" is awesome.  

+ ""Prowsey"" - I like that the manager calls him that, shows a bit of camaraderie already (and we all know we want Ward-Prowse to be our next super-star Saint).  

* When asked about future business said yes, hopefully a couple of players, especially a winger. BUT:

- Didn't comment on Townsend rumours (see [transfer thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsFC/comments/26ta1b/summer_transfer_thread/), as he ""doesn't comment on rumours"". Which is good because he's often said ""we're interested in this player/that player"" when things have happened (i.e. Gardos, interested in but ultimately not getting Rojo etc).  

I really like him so far, and hopefully that's not just as seen through rose tinted glasses. In interviews he's direct, he's (for all we know so far) honest, he says things simply, and he doesn't get drawn in on things (Schneiderlin, rumours in general etc). That's not just from this interview but from all the ones I've seen of him so far.

Had a friend look at it but when he looked it fixed itself, went out of limp mode... but we didn't have the stupid subwoofer on when he test-drove it (and ragged the hell out of it), and then after he left I put into into Chavcon-1 and blasted Ibiza tat really loud on a drive, put my foot down and sure enough, limp-mode again.

Hopefully it is just this horrendous sound system fucking with the car, and it isn't actually already broken, as it's not even done 50k miles, is a Ford (usually reliable, right?), and a major engine malfunction, which the computer is saying is wrong with it, could cost thousands to fix.

Looked up the fault on the first forums that came up in google, and apparently people have these faults and keep driving their cars to work etc. in limp mode? Fuck me, just get the train or even a taxi... imagine how much worse you're making it if you keep driving.

The South's stronger economy attracts more migrants, notably to small market towns. This has the effect of greatly increasing the perceived magnitude of immigration to the UK as a whole in these constituencies, leading to UKIP's stronger representation in the South.

Why? 

What is the point in keeping extreme criminals, who are beyond rehabilitation (serial killers/psychopaths etc), alive in a prison at extraordinary cost to the tax payer?

The arguments against the death penalty seem to me to be silly and illogical. 

&gt;Well what if an innocent is killed?

Simple. Introduce the death penalty only for cases where the evidence is absolutely undeniable, for example a serial killer is caught on HD cctv committing a crime, he is found with the blood of the victim on him as well as the murder weapon, and in his house they find videos that he recorded of him committing other murders. 

That is an example of a case where the evidence is simply so compelling that it is CERTAIN that the person is guilty. 

Why not have the death penalty for cases like that? 

&gt;But if we kill a person, that means we are just as bad as the criminal!

I have never understood this argument. How is it just as bad to kill a serial murderer, for the purpose of removing them from society permanently due to the fact that they are a SERIAL MURDERER, as it is to actually go around killing innocent people? 

This is a completely incoherent and absurd argument that is on its face irrational. 

&gt;But what about the families of those put to death! Won't they suffer?

This is the only argument I consider to actually carry any weight, but even then not much. If we were to take this line of argument, then we should be totally against war in every form, even just wars like the 2nd world war, because after all, every solider we kill will have a family that is deeply saddened by their death.

He let's Clyne run around the back of him clearly because he is the definition of ball watching. He should have also got a shout from Stevie if he didn't already.
It doesn't matter if he is blocking the space for the pass in the middle if the runner is alreadly past him or not going to be there, so he is effectively marking space where the ball won't go and ball watching.

After the long pass over the right. Pellegrini starts shouting: ""Aguanta"" ""Aguanta"" ""Aguanta"" (""Hold"") and then the LB is instructed to overlap. When the overlap is almost complete Pellegrini shouts ""YA"" (""Now"") and the player releases the ball to the space in front of the LB and then he starts running towards the center of the area. The LB is then instructed to cross (more like pass) to the unmarked man. (Pelle's shouting ""está sin marca"" -It's unmarked!"").

I find the video quite interesting because I it shows one of the ways Pelle's teams attack. 

Disclaimer: This opinion is based on my limited knowledge and understanding of football. Take it with a grain of salt.

Despite being a few years old video of his Malaga days, I think  a good chunk of City's goals last season were in similar fashion. Hold the ball, be patient, wait for the teammate, pass to the space. The fluidity and relationship between holds and runs and the understanding of your teammates intentions I think is vital to Pelle's system. 

That's why Dzeko struggled at the beginning of last season. His hold up play was atrocious (now he is totally adapted) and I think it's part of the reason Kolarov and nasri could shine now. The beautiful Serbian can attack/overlap the space and cross or shoot exactly the way he likes. And Nasri can hold and recycle possession to his heart's desire if no teammate run or space is available.

Ljajic had a rather meh season at Roma, but before that he had an amazing one at fiorentina. He mainly plays on the left but is capable of playing as a second striker or cf. Like auba, firmino, and son i think this could help them get on the teamsheet more often than just someone who is a backup striker and would allow us to seamlessly shift into a 4-4-2 diamond if we wanted some extra fire power. Here are two images that I believe display his production the best over the last two seasons courtesy of Ted Knutson or @mixedknuts on twitter

Admittedly I know less about aubameyang but I recall reading rumors awhile back Dortmund were williing to sell for around 14 million euros which is relatively cheap. He has blistering pace, but a poor first touch. He does primarily play on the wing but can play cf, his physicality may be lacking for the premier league however.

Here are some other radars I dug up from those you looked at just to supplement your post. I just like them as a way to give a sketch to the type of player they are. For us it seems we like players that have large amounts of dribbles and through balls no matter the positon. My top picks would probably be vela, volland, and son

However, from a savings point of view, see below:

I would highly doubt you can buy a flat for 20k. I imagine your dad is meaning use it as a deposit, get a mortgage and use the rent to pay that off. I personally wouldn't like to do this, it'll be hard for you to get a buy to let mortgage, and even if you did, its a lot of work if you manage the letting yourself, and if you hand it over to a third party, you'll be paying them fees too.

If you think you'll be staying in the same location for the next 5+ years, then looking into using this as a deposit on a flat (for you to live in) could be a good idea. However, again, getting a mortgage when you only work part time (and plan to go to uni again next year) will be hard.

Putting it in a savings account would be a good idea. The Santander 123 account will give you 3% on £3000 - £20000, and cashback on some direct debts, but you'll have to adhear to a few rules (pay £2 per month, add £500 per month into the account, and have 2 direct debts), but definitely read up on it: http://www.santander.co.uk/uk/current-accounts/123-current-account  
Assuming a few DD's that pay some cashback, then you could earn around £600+/year (so about £50/month).

Although I do understand this argument I am skeptical as to whether it would actually work in reality. It was and still is incredibly easy for teenagers to buy alcohol and cigarettes.

I think people have this idea that if legalized the black market will somehow go away. The most trafficked items in the world are cigarettes followed by alcohol. The inevitable high taxation will still allow substantial profit to be made by illegal dealers undercutting shops, especially as much of our weed is home grown.

It could in fact push them to sell more to teenagers as adults would be more likely to buy from licensed shops. That is just speculation on my part though, however possible.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Because Scotland is currently a part of an EU member state, it is already compliant with most EU requirements of membership.

Other than the mandatory ones that the UK managed to negotiate opt-outs to, which is likely to be somewhat contentious.

&gt; I think it's unreasonable to say that there would be major issues with Scotland becoming a member state other than vindictive obstructionist tactics from rUK, which if my understanding is correct could and I'm sure would be vetoed by other member states.

I think you misunderstand how it works - you cannot ""veto a veto"", nor are accession talks really something that you can veto in general. 

New member states join the EU through a treaty that must be agreed between *all* existing member states. That in itself is not contentious, although a new treaty means that literally everything else in the EU is up for negotiation and reform and you can expect the existing member states to push *hard* to have their own reforms included, particularly the UK which has made a big song and dance about EU reform and the repatriation of powers.

Potentially every member state will try and renegotiate the existing institutions to their own advantage and in reality, Scotland's membership will be nothing but a footnote to the real negotiations between everyone else.

The political wrangling is one thing, the time that it will take is something else entirely and the negotiations will proceed along a time table that will suit everyone else, not Scotland.

I don't think anyone reasonably doubts that an independent Scotland will eventually join the EU, but the exact terms and the timescale are what is uncertain.",0,1408306464,null,0,false,0,cjsy2ef,t3_2druy6,t1_cjsy2ef,t1_cjsqltp,null,1435287302,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

What they are basically doing is trying to connect to everyone's computers and working out what ports it is using -- e.g. if it's 80, they know you have a web server running on it. But they'll also be looking for old software which they know can be exploited.
