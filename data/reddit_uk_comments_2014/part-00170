Is your idea of utopia really sitting around all day consuming endless entertainment?  Why not volunteer, or start making art, or coding videogames, or making music, or becoming a more central part of your local dance/yoga studio, or Church/Mosque/Synagogue if you're religious?   

Automation will lead to a change in society into one in which not everyone works to survive.  Heck, the welfare state is already halfway there.   But just because you might not longer be working for a living, doesn't mean that you can't try and become accomplished, or successful, or good at something.  

People play Chess competitively even though machines became better than the finest players in 1997.   Doesn't matter- because improving and getting better at the sport is fulfilling and something they enjoy. 

If you're middle aged and your job is to be taken by machines soon, the best advice I can give is to make sure you live in a house you fully own (if at all possible), live within your means as much as possible, and have your debts paid off.   If you are especially paranoid or live in the country then perhaps investing in some 'means of production' (ie solar panels, growing a fruit/vegetable garden) might be useful.  If you have an idea for a business, that might be an idea as well.

Actually, after TATM the doctor never has contact with the ponds. As far as we have seen. During the cubes episode, the doctor takes them to an old hotel for their honeymoon as a gift. This obviously went wrong. Then somehow they ended up under the bed through some unknown events. When they return to their anniversary party, Rory's father asks how long they have been gone, to which the doctor responds 3 months I think. (Don't remember exact #)But this all happened between them leaving their anniversary party and returning. 

So as a timeline it would be

1.Cubes
2.anniversary party
3. Hotel invasion during anniversary present from doctor
4. Unknown events that lead to under the bed scene
5. Return to anniversary party 
6. Continued series to TATM 

Someone may correct me if I'm wrong. But that seems like how it played out to me.

Edit: Also, the Doctor is unable to visit the ponds due to issues with the timeline after TATM. If he was to go back, it would rip open time. And all chaos would ensue",0,1402853486,null,0,1402853673,0,ci87csd,t3_287k80,t1_ci87csd,t3_287k80,null,1434250178,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

My point is that you can never tell. Some great talents will just improve and improve untill they're the next Messi or Ronaldo, but most won't. Many of these will become good players in their own right, but most just won't.

Look, I hate to say it but Alexis Sanchez and/or Pedro are not coming to Liverpool. One thing that all users here seems to forget is Barcelona's willingness to sell, which is simply non-existent. Both wingers had fantastic seasons at Barca and are long term investments for the club. There is a very low likelihood that they would part with either winger for less than 50 m, and even then they would probably not sell. It's similar to the Lallana situation where the players mean a lot to the club and the club is very reluctant to sell, barring a transfer request from either player. Both Alexis and Pedro (while maybe somewhat unhappy at the rotation policy adopted by Barca), are still very happy playing at their ""dream club"" and are very unlikely to put in a request for a transfer as Lallana supposedly has. I think we'd have a better chance of signing Cristian Tello, who, with the emergence of Deulofeu will see his minutes probably decrease further. He still has so much potential and has scored a hat trick in his very limited playing time at Barcelona. We sign young players looking to improve their situation, and Alexis's and Pedro's situation is pretty much top notch at Barcelona. We are much more likely to land Lallana, Shaqiri, or Tello as they will probably see their importance and careers improve in the Liverpool system.",1,1402854835,null,0,false,0,ci87wmk,t3_287mch,t1_ci87wmk,t3_287mch,null,1434250438,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

Oh, there are a few things I'm good at, sadly most aren't currently lucrative.  But I wasn't specifically talking about myself.

&gt;Is your idea of utopia really sitting around all day consuming endless entertainment?

God no.

&gt;Why not volunteer, or start making art, or coding videogames, or making music, or becoming a more central part of your local dance/yoga studio, or Church/Mosque/Synagogue if you're religious? 

All of these are great ideas (well, except personally the religion angle), but few people would be able to make livings from them.

&gt;But just because you might not longer be working for a living, doesn't mean that you can't try and become accomplished, or successful, or good at something. 

Yes, of course, I totally concur on that, but it presupposes that people will be able to have the wherewithal to live, and to live reasonably well, without paid employment, or at least, without full time employment.

If they've been periodic from the outset, it must fulfill (4)(a) and end on the last day of the rental period, which an extraordinary number of landlords had great difficulty in doing! There was of course always the popular back up clause 'or if not valid after the next expiry date...' 

A statutory periodic tenancy can be created from the outset, but it's very unusual to see. Essentially, it's any tenant moving into accommodation fulfilling the criteria for an AST rather than a license who is not given a tenancy agreement. 

I'm the duty adviser for possession cases at two courts and the only times I've come across it are B&amp;Bs letting self-contained rooms- they usually just provide a certificate of rent for housing benefit purposes and not a tenancy agreement, therefore it's periodic from the outset. 

We're still seeing quite a lot of agencies serving S21s fulfilling (4)(a) even when there's been a fixed term I think, just to be extra cautious!

One of the District Judges we have regularly can be a bit shakey on the law, and since I'm there to represent the tenant, I am mildly concerned that I'll one day get called out by him for having failed to notice a S21 that doesn't fulfil (4)(a) when there's no need for it to do so. Obviously pointing out that he's mistaken would not be in my client's favour, but I'd look like an idiot if I didn't!

Since you clearly know housing law, this is the same D Judge who, even though a Section 8 Ground 8 was undoubtedly proven in court, allowed my client to remain on a suspended possession order because they were due to inherit some money in a few months that would clear the arrears!

I first read about automation in Wired at the turn of the century, when I was 17 or 18 years old.  I ended up deciding to go into corporate banking, because it's essentially a sales role and I figured those would be among the last to be automated.  Over the past decade, with every hint about self-driving cars and auto-check ins, and self-check outs and so on it's happened slower than I expected back then, but it's happened nonetheless and I think it will continue happening.  

I've saved every penny I could (which admittedly has probably been easier in this career than in most others) and bought some undeveloped land in Germany that I am slowly building a small farm on with my relatives who live there.  We have pooled together our money, and grow fruits and vegetables while using 'negative energy' due to their generous solar power subsidies.   My plan is to hopefully 'retire' there when my own job is replaced. 

Clearly the system has to change, and I have no doubt that eventually some sort of basic income will have to be adopted.   I'm just wondering whether one might begin to think of interesting and mentally/physically stimulating things to do once it happens, when it hopefully does.   To be honest with you, we're here and we have time to prepare, so I don't see any reason not to do so.    Part of that is campaigning for a basic income, and part of it is thinking about how we're going to spend our futures when it's (fingers crossed) there.  

Personally, I just happen to think that lamenting on the internet about how life sucks and things will all go to shit in the next few years, it would be more productive to campaign for UBI and prepare to do fun things with our lives.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The struggle I see with this optimism goes as follows: in spite of early hostility against the migration of Afro-Carribean, West African Indians and those from the Indian subcontinent, the early immigrants seemed to have a much faster rate of integration than all subsequent generations. There was a time when the zeitgeist included the image of Indian families in the Midlands dressing-up in the familiar corduroy trousers and woolen jumpers, or Carribean men in old photographs starting the fashion trend of skinheads with their braces over flannel shirts and doc marten boots. There was some mutual exchange in ideas - but it demonstrated all arrivals finding a place for themselves in a strange new land. 

Today, certain spots of major cities have largely repelled the older inhabitants for the newer migrant communities. Despite some adaption to a new climate and surrounding environment, an immigrant can likely find family to settle in with, and meet people of the same background as them. They have no reason to change their ways, as opportunistic tradesmen will go to lengths to establish businesses for imported produce, and have small communal buildings for meetings or ceremonial functions. These are the places where conservatives (that to us would step over the boundary into the radical due to the culture gap) will take-up residence and do their thing.

There was a speech as I recall, where a politician said the day full integration is achieved is when a cathedral can be built in Saudi Arabia, or better yet no religious buildings be built at all.

true,crucible,null,null,"&gt; Superb news that better routes are being planned. Shame it is happening now, not twenty or thirty years ago. This kind of thing is essential to the existence of railways, and would be happening with or without private operators.

Yeah, but to be fair there were London services to Blackpool ~20 years ago under BR and Intercity. Privatisation and smaller train fleets mean it is harder for the likes of Virgin to spare a Voyager to run to Blackpool, indeed their recent application to run a daily Blackpool service was turned down by the likes of Network Rail.

Perhaps these GNWR services have been longer in the planning stage than we thought.

&gt; Watch out, though: Anglia, in their management buy-out days, reintroduced through services from London to Lowestoft along the East Suffolk line. At a stroke, almost all services became London ones. They also helped to put a passing loop in place, to improve service on the line after singling in the 1980s.

&gt; National Express take over the new franchise, and suddenly none of this is important. The concept of through trains was rejected, and the ""improved reliability"" of connections was the selling point. Back to the local services, square one, but the completion of the passing loop made it possible for them to plug a 'new' 'improved' service.

National Express have had an up and down history with the UK's railways - I would say they are better at running local and regional services like c2c than Intercity ones like Anglia or East Coast.

Thankfully the Anglia franchise will have a few years of stability now under Abellio and there are upgrades planned for some of the train fleets. The last few years have seen a merry-go-round of operators on that franchise which has frankly left the area's rail services in a bit of a mess.

&gt; Nobody is in any doubt that the WCML is reaching capacity. 'The case for HS2' doesn't necessarily address that at all, but rather focusses on the specific supposed benefits a high-speed link would provide. Honest discussions would start with the fact that the WCML can't carry more, passengers OR freight, and then look at options.

Really? And as for Hispanics - that is a recent and ongoing case of immigration, so we haven't had the long-term timeframe needed to look back and see that it actually *isn't* the end of the world.

In the 1920s, America saw significant immigration from Europe; notable Irish, Italians, Jews, Eastern Europeans.

Has American culture been replaced/threatened by any of those? Did they, as was feared, bring about the communist downfall of the nation? Or the crime and anarchy that was so widely claimed at the time? Have the Roman Catholics, with whom the religious tensions from the native Protestants were so high, become the majority? Nope.

We can see clearly that the fears were totally misplaced in the long run (and even in the short run). It's the same with basically all cases of immigration, as with Muslims in Britain today. A few decades from now we'll see that our paranoia was a big fuss over basically nothing, the country hasn't been harmed in the long term, and Muslims have assimilated.

However, I agree with your statement about the need for other countries to economically develop. But that's just going to come with time.

Well, that's true, but that's not the point is it? You're selectively comparing with specific, obviously worse alternatives and ignoring plenty of other possible alternatives as if they don't exist. 

One possible alternative is that Nike pays more for the same labour and takes a marginally smaller profit, but still makes a sufficient profit nevertheless.

But this will not happen, because there is no concept of ""sufficient"" profit in capitalism. Maximisation is the one and only goal. If it is possible to find workers that can be exploited more, then that's where capitalism will go. That is what people don't like about morality-blind capitalism.

true,investor1001,null,null,"Yes this is one factor, and ceteris paribus, an interest rate rise in England will see the £ rise against the $ when US interest rates are stagnant. However, currency strength is also based on a number of other factors which implement demand for that currency (supply is really controlled by interest rates).

Demand for a currency will increase if the underlying economy strengthens, if the country is seen to be highly politically stable and if more individuals want to go to that country (ie live or travel there).

The pound is currently very strong in a relative sense because all of the factors outlined in demand are at a peak. The UK is seeing the highest growth of western countries, UK is seen to be very politically stable in comparison to Eurozone and US, and the conservative policies have seen a lot of foreign money be deposited in the UK because it's unlikely to be overly taxed (such as we see in Hollande's France) or nicked (as we see in Putin's Russia).

If we get a less conservative government such as Labour (high likelihood), and we see a slowing in growth (medium likelihood), along with more centralised and stable governance in France and the rest of Europe (low likelihood) then we may see the £ start to decrease relatively.

I don't know much about Asia and the US so those economies may see major growth and see an influx of £ to them (lowering the £ value).

1. You're 16 - meaning even with a graduated licence scheme the earliest you'll be able to ride that thing is 19 on an A2 licence and even then it'll be restricted. Do you think you'll be comfortable being unable to legally ride your restored bike for three years? 

2. That thing looks like a hunk of junk and at 41,000 is going to run in to a whole host of other problems/already have lots of problems the seller hasn't told you about. The fact it doesn't run/start means the engine internals should be treated as a complete goner - especially if the seller seems to know his way around mechanics. Think of it this way, if it's an easy/simple fix why hasn't he done it? If he has a legitimate reason beyond not having gotten round to doing it, chances are you are getting yourself way in over your head with a problem you potentially can't fix. 

3. Those old XJs are bloody heavy! As a first bike you'd struggle on one, even restricted, given that it's an I4 motor and comes with too much power for a beginner. I'd suggest getting yourself something smaller - wait til you're 17 and get a 125 on a CBT then hold out til you're 19 to take your A2 licence. As someone who did just that, I cannot recommend having a small, easy to manoeuvre and frugal machine as your first. Makes it easy to learn how to ride it too! 

4. Have you got any mechanical know-how? Most mechanical stuff is generally straightforward, the one exception being engine internals. The fork seals, battery, rims and brakes would be easy fixes - it's dealing with head gaskets, valves, carburettors etc. that require a lot of knowledge. What if you spend £500+ getting it almost running and then find it doesn't run? Would you be in a position to diagnose what the problem was? 

I'm not going to say 'don't do it' based on the mechanical aspect but rather 'do you think you can do it and are you willing to be patient and prepared to potentially spend some cash and a LONG time sorting all these problems out?'. What I will say is that you should think about getting a smaller bike regardless, that bike is too big for a beginner and so is still a couple of years away for you. 

Go for a 125 when you're 17, see how you feel about motorbiking and get out on the road. A couple of years will pass in no time and you'll have the chance to get a big bike a bit later down the line. As someone who passed well over a year ago, I can't believe it's been a year on a restricted licence.. feels like yesterday!

Check the inside of the tank for rust. When I got mine it was all rusty and it had formed a sludge in the bottom of the tank that blocked the fuel line.

The older models (pre-1995) had a mechnical fuel pump which was quite annoying if the bike had been stood long enough for the carbs to empty. Setting the fuel tap to PRI only primes the pump, not the carbs, so you have to lean on the starter for ages to get enough fuel flowing to start it up. Something to be aware of before you flatten your battery/burn out the starter motor while you're trying to get it running. I ended up adding an additional fuel line to prime the carbs, made my life much more pleasant.

It's part of the problem, yes. But far from the whole story.

But if companies didn't agree with the poor wages/conditions for these people and were restricted by the government from doing anything about it, they could always choose to not set up business there. However, the reality is that pay and conditions are poor in these countries for the simple reason that the only pressure ever applied on governments in this area is downwards - businesses are able to, and choose to, move their work to whichever economy offers the cheapest deal, whilst the workers are prevented both economically and legally from moving to countries that would offer them better protection.

Equally, western governments could choose to apply a requirement for comparable levels of worker protection regulations for any product that's sold in their country as those in place for ones that are made there. 

And of course consumers don't agree with the price, or don't agree with the way that they are made, they could always choose not to buy them.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"Well the first step is to move away from the view that its our problem to solve.

The Iraqi's shaped their own political climate post-Saddam, and a less sectarian government may have stopped this situation developing.

We also have to recognise that not intervening can be every bit as bloody for the people on the ground as intervening; Syria is no better for us having stayed out of it. There is even an argument to be made that had we got more involved, and strengthened the moderate rebels when we had that chance, that groups like Isis may never have become dominant.

Playing with dictators is what the west has done for years; when the people of Iran got tired of their leaders (our allies) abusing them they had an (Shia) Islamic revolution; we armed Iraq (lead by Saddam - minority Sunni government), and the resulting war between the two countries left an estimated 1.5million dead. When Iraq went on to invade Kuwait &amp; Saudi Arabia to steal the resources to rebuild its shattered economy, we went to war to stop them. When Iraq refused to step in line, we went to war again to pacify the region. It didn't work; Iran used the power vacuum to push a sectarian (and majority) Shai government into power, a group at odds with the Sunni in neighboring Syria (what is now Isis).

What's the solution? Diplomacy, backed up by force. We can't be afraid to intervene when we need too; we have a moral obligation to help those less fortunate who request our aid. Not acting may protect our consciousnesses, but in my view its moral cowardliness; if people die by our refusal to intervene, we still have blood on our hands.

But we also need to recognise that only acting in our own best interests destroys our moral authority, and that we can ultimately only give people the freedom to make their own choices; what they do with that choice is not our responsibility, but if they mess up and ask for our help, we need to be willing to give it.

So my view is we should give the Iraqi government any non-combat support needed (intelligence assets, supplies, tactical advice). We also need to work out a diplomatic end to the Syrian conflict, in the same way that sorting issues within Pakistan is the key to stabilising Afghanistan.",0,1402867812,null,0,false,0,ci8davx,t3_286tmu,t1_ci8davx,t1_ci80miw,null,1434253046,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

That's simply not true. All of these groups started up  due to underlying political issues, most of the time involving a larger nation throwing their weight around in an area they felt affinity with. This is equally true for Christian and atheist terror groups. Some use religion to bolster their ranks but it's all lip-service. 

Our own propagandists focus on the religious aspect so as to not give their demands any credence. Particularly the ""72 virgins"" myth, it is intended to make their entire cause appear retarded.

Actual religion has very little to do with Iraq for example. The battles we are seeing today are two different ethnic groups, Shia and Sunni, fighting for control of the country.

The fact that still now women are expected to retain custody of children is _not_ due to some anti-male conspiracy of the civil court system, but a remnant of our old-fashioned gender roles that the law hasn't caught up with yet.

The solution of course is pretty difficult. Get rid of the stigma of being a stay-at-home dad, give fathers paternity leave equal to what women receive, and get rid of the notion that once a woman gives birth she has to become a housewife.

I think we went to war there on good intentions, I don't think it was a lie from Blair about the WMD, I think he was given wrong information by people he had to trust. I also think it was the right thing to do but I think the worst possible thing we could do was just fuck off out of the country and leave them to it. 

Things I think about when it comes to war....

- Generally the same people who support our troops going to war are the same people slagging off the government when we have troops coming home in body bags. This is the nature of war, people die, and I speak as someone who has been to war on multiple occasions. Those 'patriotic' people who support our troops can't accept that people have to die, so then they demand our boys come home, that ends up fucking up what we're supposed to do. 

- We could have stayed and helped more, we should have stayed and helped more. That may have meant more UK deaths but it could have prevented so many more Iraqi deaths. The problem as I see it though is that the governments are trying to do the right thing, they are trying to give power back to people or groups that can't handle it, but on the other side people will accuse ours government of taking control.

- We will never know what would have happened if we hadn't done something, we have to ignore that and look at what we can do for the future. How can we use our resources to help these people? What can we do for them? But there's no good answer there is there? Parts of the UK public (big parts) put the lives of people like me above those of brown children who are dying in Iraq every day, ""because its none of our business"" or whatever. 

- Governments are scared of putting a value on human life, because the public are also scare to do so. It has to be done but any government who publicly does so will be slated for years.

There's so much more I could say.... I'm pretty much a fence-sitter, I end up sitting here, seeing both sides of things and arguing with both sides because I really hate bias. 

There's no right answer because there's cunts on all sides, supporting wars, against wars, looking for any reason to support the government, looking for any reason to hate the government,supporting 'out boys', looking for any reason to slag off the military, etc etc. 

And it's all deeper-seated than that, it's down to who we vote for and why, to a more base level it's down to human nature, it will never be right and it's always going to be completely fucked up because nobody will ever be happy about everything. I see you all with your strong opinions and I sit here thinking we're all fucked and we always will be, because of us. 

My main point is that we should be helping all innocent people around the world, not because it makes us look good, but it's because it's the right thing to do. 

That's my 2p anyway, I could have written more but I have to go to bed now. Sorry that it's gone from Iraq to everything else. ",0,1402870402,null,0,false,0,ci8ecr2,t3_287r6f,t1_ci8ecr2,t3_287r6f,null,1434253543,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The first time I was driving through Manchester at 2am having driven colleagues home from a catering job in Llandudno. I was driving a little erratically because I'd just worked 3 very long shifts and I didn't know exactly how to get home. I noticed that there was a police car behind me with lights flashing and so I pulled over, expecting them to drive past me. They didn't. They told me that I didn't have insurance. I was sure I did because I'd gone with Swiftcover using Compare the Market and although I hadn't printed the certificate, it was on my desktop.

Long story short, I got my car back and was never charged. I like to believe the Police realised that it was just a careless mistake and not part of anything sinister. It's been 3 years now. I'm a lot more careful now with my paper-work.

The second time was a bit more innocuous. I was driving to Middlesbrough from Darlington where I'd worked as a sound engineer on a Carribean music festival at about 2:30am. I'd been up since 5am the previous day and worked about 22 hours, building the entire thing with 3 or 4 other guys. I realised when I got into my car that the fuel light was flashing, so I had to drive slowly and efficiently home because all the garages were shut. I made it as far as Thornaby, where I knew there to be a 24 hour ASDA pay-at-pump station. I stopped at a red some light, which was right near the job I used to work at. 

These lights were part of a big cross-roads area and I knew the patterns very well because I'd worked nearby for a couple of years. The light was red, the pedestrian light was red too. I was sat there for about 5 minutes and didn't see even a hint of a car. I panicked because I couldn't turn around (one-way) and I couldn't just run the light.. I waited and waited then decided ""fuck this, they must be bust"". So I ran the light. Bam, blue lights flashing behind me.

The officer gets out and gives me a bollocking. I explained the situation and the bobby said ""look, a lot of other traffic cops like this job. Be very careful and don't run red lights"" and let me off with that. Managed to get my car filled up and went home. Really enjoyed that bong-rip when I got in.

I can't speak for everyone, but I see this as a perception issue rather than actual commentary on specific actions. Where RvP was under contract, wrote that awful letter, forced Wenger's hand on the transfer, etc. Sagna faithfully played out his contract and didn't cause any fuss. 

You're perceiving it as him doing something malicious like keeping the club from getting money. You're assuming intent. As you'll sadly get to know, Sagna is an upstanding guy. The perception you'll gain is that he's a hard worker that truly cares about his club. So, throughout the years he's shown us his personality, and in return, we are confident that he didn't have any mal-intent like you're assuming.

true,ZFree2013,null,null,"&gt;What would you do with Reina this season? (if he stays)

I wouldn't let him stay in the first place. I would be doing everything I could to offload him because I simply could not guarantee him a first place start, instead he would be a rotation option that would be on massive wages, and probably not too happy to spend a considerable amount of time on the bench.

Of course there is little doubt in my mind that a second goalkeeper is imperative, but keeping wages down is also a second desideratum to Brendan it seems. 

I personally do not perceive Brad Jones to be of good enough quality for a second goalkeeper from what I have seen of him, and perhaps this could be due to not having the chances arise to really thrive and string together performances, but I still feel a stronger option is needed. If come October, the worst happens and Mignolet gets a long term injury, I think it would be a big issue, and one that should not be over-looked.

And then of course there is the argument of, perhaps you could start Reina over Mignolet, thus justifying his wages. However I would still suggest that Reina may not be the keeper he once was. One advantage however, would be Reinas ability to command his area, which was one of Mignolets few weaknesses last season, so Mignolet could do well to learn from Reina, but it comes at the cost of high wages, and keeping Reina happy with enough football. 

At his age I assume he wants to play as much as he can,  and keeping him on the sidelines for Champions League group games and the FA/Carling cup could frustrate him. 

At the end of the day, I do not think Brendan sees Reina in his plans, and whilst I will always remember him as a legend, I would  rather those memories not be sullied by an ongoing transfer crisis. I think he is pretty much odds on to be gone anyway, so I suppose in many ways it is purely academic.

The question leaves the threat unspecified and names a particular group even though it's perfectly possible to answer yes even if the group was just ""lots of people"", and uses ""do you think it could **ever** be acceptable"" so obviously respondents will consider extreme situations.

""Your religion was under threat"" might mean something like the Jewish holocaust. I think I'd kill to prevent 6 million people being murdered, whatever their religion, but I don't think that makes me an agnostic extremist.

Do you think it could ever be acceptable to kill if your friends were under threat?

Does that mean you think your friends are special? Does it mean you'd just let strangers go to the gas chamber? If you say ""yes"" to both of these, that doesn't mean much other than that maybe you're more honest than most people - most people will let strangers go to the gas chamber rather than stick their necks out, as history shows - but that's not exactly a good thing.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;I'm not going to change my point, which is pretty obvious already.    

Your own comments did already change your point of view.   

Your own comments made it known that you were arguing not could but would, and that what I was arguing could be done.

I then raised it to your attention that the comment you were replying to specifically said 'could'.

&gt; You didn't hesitate making fun of my English language, even though you probably had a very good idea I'm a foreigner and that side comment was only meant to do a personal attack, rather than add anything into discussion.

Actually I made a point of saying that your English in general was good, but that it comes *loose* at times when you seem more angry.  The only reason I raised it was in context to a paragraph which was unintelligible.  I simply stated that I couldn't reply to something which couldn't read.

It wasn't an ad hominem.  It was certainly something that added to the discussion given that it stalled discussion.

&gt;Of course UCAS only relates to pre-university standards.

Good. So we have killed the UCAS aspect then in its infancy. 

&gt;No, my point still stands and it clearly shows that your whole argument of ""the best"" is not real, as UK import people from countries which have very low education standards and they don't even understand medical establishments in those countries, hence the report I've linked you to (surprised it wasn't done before and to all countries, where they import medical staff).

&gt;Also, if you look in details you will see that those differences in position actually show very small differences in overall score.

Actually, and I assume you're talking about the countries *I linked* to, they have very high education standards with courses taught in English.

&gt;Good. Maybe that's the reason gun related crime is so low. I know they have some point in the US to have guns for self defence, but the way they're doing it is clearly mobbed by gun manufacturers.

But that doesn't address the UKIP argument.  We already had the second strictest gun laws in the developed world.  They were tightened by Major post Dunblane.  Blair reforms stopped gun-target, single load laws - firearms that haven't been used in these mass shootings.   

You brought up UKIP gun reform, but in this case it really doesn't apply.

&gt;Doesn't matter, his comment was kind of racist and every sane person would realise that. Why Mr Farage isn't making comments like that regarding migrants from Africa? I've looked a while ago into statistics and it's clear there is something..... but obviously it shouldn't be resolved by pointing fingers and saying you are bad because you come from a bad country. You, defending Farage with this proves my point of not being objective.

This is a bolt out of the blue, and is more a sign of you not understanding what has been said.

You don't really get to say things like 'objective' when you also admit you don't 'know' but want to add an uninformed interpretation.

true,Captain_English,null,null,"The fundamental tenet of capitalism is that those with capital set up structures which produce things of value, but they receive a return on their capital investment. 

With me so far? 

So in order for them to receive their return, they must sell whatever is produce at above the cost of manufacture, obviously. 

A component of manufacturing cost is, and always will be, the labour that goes in to it. 

In fact, even the cost of the materials and equipment used is really just paying for the end product of someone else's labour. Someone had to make the tools or dig out and process the metals, and at the end of the day when you go down to fundamental components it's all just people's time and effort, right? At every step of production, going back down the supply chain, some fundamental bits came in, people did stuff to them, and different stuff came out. You go back and back until eventually you get to someone cultivating seeds and growing cotton or digging in a mine. Everything is just someone's work. 

So you're selling a product which is the end result of potentially hundreds of people's work, and you have to sell it at more than it costs to make to make a profit. 

So you've taken the effort of lots of other people, and then sold that effort for more than you paid the people who did all the work. 

Simply because you put the money up front to begin with, you get to take profit on other people's work, that would otherwise go in to the wages of everyone in the supply chain. 

Do you see how some people see that as theft? 

This is exactly what capitalism is! 

The whole purpose of Marxism is to remove that theft, and make sure that every $ of value from a worker's labour is fairly split according to who actually did the work. Unfortunately... It doesn't work. 

But the fundamental underpinnings of communism is to eliminate theft, to eliminate exploitation of workers, whereas the underpinnings of capitalism is to take exploitation and make a world out of it.

If you want to stitch up your ex, then you claim that he was violent to the kid - say that the child was tardy or misbehaved and the father responded by grabbing the child by the hair or twisting the child's arm.

This will ensure that the accused parent is denied access to their child whilst the thing goes to child protection court, which takes months. I'd imagine appeals can stretch this longer.

When everything's settled the spiteful mother can fail to turn up when she's supposed to hand over the kid for a weekend's access, blame that on the father, too, and make another false accusation a few weeks later. 

This can literally turn into years of separation because the child can't be left with a violent parent, and it becomes his word against hers.

This happens to mothers, too, but ""child endangerment"" lies are used disproportionately against fathers because of a natural human tendency to believe stereotypes in stories. ",0,1402879950,null,0,false,0,ci8i7pz,t3_28754x,t1_ci8i7pz,t1_ci834pl,null,1434255429,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Transfermarkt doesn't work because it doesn't take into account a selling situation. A relegated club, or a club having a fire sale, or wanting to get rid of a player might sell for far below value. A club that has no reason to sell probably will demand a much higher fee. You could maybe make the case that their data is based on raw performance values, but then why is Lallana so cheap?

&gt;Where does money come from?  In the modern economy, most money takes the form of bank deposits. But how those bank deposits are created is often misunderstood. The principal way in which they are created is through commercial banks making loans: whenever a bank makes a loan, it creates a deposit in the borrower’s bank account, thereby creating new money.  This description of how money is created differs from the story found in some economics textbooks. 

Repeat; ""This description of how money is created differs from the story found in some economics textbooks."" - The mainstream is wrong.

As for your quote, that is not the economics term for fractional reserve banking, just because the banks keep some fraction of money it does not mean it is a fractional reserve banking system. Of course they have to have some money to give to people and of course this is a fraction of what they lend, but fractional reserve banking is a model that constrains lending due to the base money supply and a reserve ratio. We do not have this system. 

The banking study is not written by an MP, but commissioned by the MP and written by banking experts.

I finished my Economics degree 2 years ago.

You have not posted very credible sources [this] (http://detlevschlichter.com/2013/01/incredible-confusions-part-1-positive-money-and-the-fallacy-of-the-need-for-a-state-money-producer/) just an economists and financial investor who is tied into the system which makes loads of money for the financial sector and I would assume make lots of money for him. [This] (http://www.primeeconomics.org/?p=2629) shows that there are supporters in Martin Wolf and the IMF, are they not credible? and you should really read the comment section. They destroy this extremely poor piece. Positive Money deals with all the so called problems in the piece. [This] (http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2011/11/whats-wrong-with-positive-money.html) seems to be a just a blog by someone who calls themselves an extremist. He says PM's proposals are simple, in fact they are very complicated. He could read the [28 pages] (http://www.positivemoney.org/our-proposals/positive-money-proposals-technical-version/) of technical information or the [22 pages] (http://www.positivemoney.org/our-proposals/draft-legislation/) of draft legislation.

There are  numerous economists that agree with similar proposals to positive money, historically as we can see; 

&gt;Milton Friedman (1960), James Tobin (1987), John Kay (2009) and Laurence Kotlikoff (2010).

Also [Steve Keen] (http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/) who actually predicted the financial crisis. Using heterodox economic theory.

Plus [The New Economics Foundation] (http://www.neweconomics.org/issues/entry/monetary-policy).

So I have given you sources by the Bank of England lots of different Economists, the New Economics Foundation, you have rightly pointed out another couple of people that agree in Martin Wolf and IMF economists.

Also remember that most of Season 5 took place within one night in Amy's Earth timeline, and I believe he returned them to the past in Season 6 as well. So it goes:

-Doctor shows up to find Amelia has grown up (Eleventh Hour)

-He returns 2 years later, and not knowing it's the night before Amy's wedding, asks her to travel with him (Eleventh Hour)

-All of season 5

-Pond wedding (Big Bang)

-Travel with the doctor through season 6

-He returns them to their ""Earth timeline"" and gives them a house (The God Complex)

-The Doctor goes off traveling for a while (two hundred years or so? seems like a long time but he has to be 1100 at Lake Silencio and he was only 900 before) and he returns to see Craig, Amy has started her modeling career as seen in the department store (Closing Time)

-Lake Silencio, wedding, etc. (Wedding of River Song)

-Some time has passed, both for the Doctor and Ponds, and they are having marital troubles. Ponds captured by Daleks and rekindle their relationship (Asylum of the Daleks)

-More traveling, Doctor meets Brian (Dinosaurs on a Spaceship)

-Ponds are living their lives with real-life jobs, and are having an anniversary party (1 year? 5 years? definitely not more than 5) and the Doctor takes them on an anniversary trip that ends up lasting a few weeks. He returns them to the party. With Brian's blessing decide to travel with the Doctor instead of living normal Earth lives (Power of Three)

-TATM happens-- Amy and Rory live out their real-time lives in the past, the Doctor can never see them again, he is very depressed and goes back to Victorian England. I'm not sure why he can't just go visit them, I don't quite buy the ""world would collapse"" thing because they're living in the same world he is (we see their graves, it's definitely the same world). I buy it for the initial time they're sent back, but I don't understand why if he can live in Victorian London, he can't go back to the 1930s and find them. But anyway, that's their story!

I feel differently after re-reading the book recently. I've always been a fan of the film but I'm somewhat pissed off that Kubrick made Jack look like an ill-tempered madman from the off. His gentle fathering and slow descent into madness was a crucial part of the book. So, fuck you Kubrick! Although I will still watch it whenever it presents itself to me.

We have a cable car, so there's that.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"Not entirely sure on Indonesia, but at least here in the Philippines, the legal minimum wage is 429 pesos - although this varies by region and profession (agricultural / farm workers are on a lower rate, and less in the provinces than in the big cities). 

That's around 5 and a half quid per day, and because of the vast oversupply of labour here, everyone from the street cleaner to a qualified nurse with 20 years experience (i.e. the missus) will ALL earn that same minimum wage.

Although overtime and ""sidelines"" tend to boost that up by 50%, so say 8 quid a day x 26 days = 208 quid a month.

Now that might not sound a lot, but when you can rent an apartment for maybe 50 quid a month, buy 20 fags for 60 pence, a bottle of brandy for about 1 pound 20, a Mcdonalds for about the same 1 pound 20 (go lookup the McDonalds index, it's one of the best guides for the relative value of money) - that minimum wage is a liveable wage.

However, and this is the biggest issue, the one that pisses me off the most when ""armchair experts"" in the UK talk about ""slavery"" in other countries - there is NO dole, NO housing benefit, NO support whatsoever. The SSS (equivalent to National Insurance) will pay you a pittance of a pension when you retire, and cover up to 10% of your medical bills. The other 90% you have to fund yourself. Getting sick is the one thing we have to avoid like the plague (if you'll excuse the pun), because if you're not working, you're not earning (no sickness benefit either).

You work or you die. It's that simple. One concept these experts seem to neglect in their eagerness to take the fucking bread from other peoples mouths in the name of ""fairness"".

People in other countries don't earn as much - but they don't need as much. However, they DO need something, because there is no alternative.

The important thing is not how far I'm running, but that I'm exercising regularly.

Also, it's 27 C at night in south Texas and 40 C during the day, with humidity around 60%.  I don't want to die.

&gt;Any ones you'd particularly recommend?

I'm cautious about King.  I'll read a book that I like (e.g., The Shining), and then one that I don't like (e.g., The Stand, unedited version).  I don't have any recommendations right now, except The Mist, and I think the movie was much better.  It has a different ending, and the woman who plays the crazy religious fanatic does an excellent job.

I agree that Jack's character development is told well in the book version of The Shining.  It's the best depiction of alcoholism that I've read.  The movie is good for the creepy atmosphere, which wasn't done as well in the book.  The dog man near the end, though....

&gt;How long are you here for, and have you visited anywhere outside London

Two weeks.  I've been to Hampton Court, but not for more than 15 years.  I went to Kew, Bath, Greenwich, and St. Albans last year.  I've been to Kew loads of times and I plan to go back this time.  I'll be visiting Stonehenge again because they've torn up all the touristy stuff and restored it to its natural state.

I've been to many places in the UK (like York, Dover, Whitby, Coventry, Cardiff, and more), but mostly a long time ago as a teenager or child.

Some people are telling me to go on the Eye, but it seems gimmicky.  Is it worthwhile?

I'd like to know where to get good food.  I like traditional British food (meat pies, fry ups, fish and chips), Asian food (like Ping Pong on the South Bank), Italian, Greek, and Turkish (like [Iznik](http://www.iznik.co.uk/menu.html)).  But really, just tell me any place that you like.

I'll be staying with family members in Islington near Highbury and Islington station, if that helps.

If the Guardian has a way of making VAT a progressive tax, please let us know.

The article also puts emphasis on Council tax. If local/national govt is to use Council tax to change the inequality in tax liability we should expect to see some massive increases in top-level council tax bands. I can't see that happening as the current criteria used to determine council tax bands would mean many people who have inherited their properties, or simply paid off their mortgages years ago, would qualify for eye-watering Council tax rates.

Personally, if taxes are going to be used in a fairer way, then consumable taxes like VAT should be greatly reduced and replaced with an emphasis on income tax. I'd like to see a flat income tax rate introduced with a higher non-taxable initial income band, to ensure those on low income really do see a reduction in the taxes they pay.

I personally think it's completely unfair and wrong for her to tell you who you can and can't introduce to your children, in the same way you have no right telling her the same. Unless of course there is a specific risk to a child, assuming there will be a risk with no evidence is, in my opinion, wrong. 

I really dislike this kind of situation because the arguments just don't make sense to me. The children might get confused? Children spend half their time being confused and/or upset, it's part of growing up. The new girlfriend might be a paedophile, I need to meet her. As if people have built-in paedo detectors! 

Anyway that was more of a rant than answering your question. However if the worst comes to the worst and she decides to stop you from seeing your kids, yeah you're going to need legal help. 

My advice, especially as you may be up against her in court at some point, start recording all contact including texts and phone calls (completely legal in the UK, she has NO right to know you're recording them either, it's on the OFTel website - http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/oftel/consumer/advice/faqs/prvfaq3.htm , what you can't do is pass them to other people, unless it's a legal case then as long as they are relevant to the case a solicitor can easily get them introduced into court proceedings, just don't start emailing them to your mates), plus make a file on a computer somewhere where you can make notes after seeing her in person. Have a record of EVERYTHING with dates and times etc so you can back yourself up if required.

On average, it costs £8-9 to manufacture a pair of them, shipping them to the UK will be pennies (for a single pair) as they're shipped in bulk. Moving them to a store costs nothing too, because they're going on a truck with a shed load of other products bound for the same store/distribution centre.

They finally reach the store, they cost nothing to have on the shelf because... well, they don't have any incurred costs. OK so you've gotta pay the staff, but the sale of a single pair of headphones isn't going to pay the wages for a whole store's worth of staff. Plus, that money comes from a budget assigned to the store by head office, which is not based on the sale of a single pair of headphones.

Total cost for a single pair of headphones to manufacture and get to a place where you can buy them will be around the £15. The total cost to the consumer will be around £40 (wired earbuds) to £330 (wireless headphones).

When you buy the headphones (until Apple rebrand them all), you're paying for the endorsement by Dr. Dre. The same thing is happening with these shirts. The reason? Because the manufacturers know that if you truly want it, you'll pay.

The current 'Lines' drawn in the Middle East were created by... oh the UK and France just after WW1....

They did not follow any Caste or Tribal lines (Pretty much how we fucked up India too...) and as a result formed countries were one religious caste was in a minority and the Majority caste abused their dominance.

Now Iran has not issues internally (with Terrorism against their own people) as they follow the instructions of the Ayatollah and the Religious leaders.

Sadly Democracy is a Western Ideology, over here we believe in seperating the Church and State, but in the middle east they place a stronger prominence on Religion.

The only way to resolve this is to 'aid' the Iranians in 'Stabilising' what is quickly become a Feudal Iraq, the Peshmerga (Kurds) have taken control of their former lands and no more, they do not kill and slay anyone who does not follow their faith.

Unlike the ISIS, they are killing anyone and everyone, faced with this kind of choice, Die if you fight, Die if you flee, you may as well just fight, either way you make a choice.

Hopefully the 'leaders' of the units that broke and ran will be located and prosecuted for desertation, by failing to stand and fight they caused the death of hundred (if not thousands) of the people they swore to protect, indeed I believe the Iranians have 'loaned' Iraq Special Forces and Guard units to stop the capital being taken. if that gets taken their will be bloodshed on a scale never seen before, one that will require the UN and Russia/China to intervene in",0,1402903512,null,0,false,0,ci8qqys,t3_281cwx,t1_ci8qqys,t1_ci6x2p3,null,1434259515,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So you can end up with the *wrong* SIM for a particular place. This can be a REAL pain, but not impossible to overcome.

Anglo-American corporate governance is whereby companys do not need a social board, they live and die by their profit figures, which is caused directly by the board. If the board causes profit to drop then a new board can be put in place.

The gist of the effects are that the anglo-american model is more responsive and provides a better environment for new and thriving businesses to explode (see: Tesla, Facebook, Apple, etc.), however it is more fragile and allows businesses to make bad long term decisions that can cause catastrophic failures (Enron, Worldcom etc.) - the debate goes on as to which model is superior.",0,1402906626,null,0,false,0,ci8rcwb,t3_287s0y,t1_ci8rcwb,t1_ci8qtju,null,1434259802,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

And by the way, the overwhelming majority of muslims do not commit terrorist attacks. As a proportion of the relative population Americans are five times more murderous than islamic extremists are 

https://infogr.am/prevalence-comparison?src=web

You may not be aware of this but thereligionofpeace.com uses a media based method to track murders by islamic extremists. It turns out that only 2.5% of all murders in this world are caused by islamic extremism while muslims make up 23% of all human beings.

My source data comes from publicly available UN collated figures. There is even a wiki here

Sort that list by rate.

The idea that muslims are any more violent than any other group is a fabrication. 

Of 1.6 billion muslims only 11,000 foreign fighters went to Syria, should all muslims be condemned because of these extremists, really?

&gt; The problem is that the Modern Left's version of the British Radical Tradition is utterly distorted.

&gt;It was never about the State taking over the lives of individuals and communities: it was never about the State telling people what to think; and it was never about being part of a multi-national, undemocratic pseudo-federal institution that imposed economic degradation on other sovereign nations.

&gt;The Working-Class Socialists I grew up amongst would have found abhorrent the idea that the welfare system should create a situation where claiming benefits rather than working was the rational choice; they would not have believed that claimants should receive benefits that gave them a better standard of living than people in work.

&gt;They would not have believed it possible that the State would ban smoking in Pubs and Clubs and thus destroy the fabric of their communities; they would have expected History to be taught in a way that was ideologically neutral: neither a Tory view, nor a Whig view, nor a Marxist view. They would have regarded the Nanny State as unthinkable because they had confidence in their own values which were based on collectivism but also self-reliance and freedom of thought. And they would have expressed a strong commitment to religious freedom and an instinctive mistrust of the New Atheism because the roots of their values lay in Non-Conformist Christianity.

&gt;They would have expected the Criminal Justice system to punish those who committed crime whilst offering rehabilitation to those who were willing to make the effort to change.
They would have taken a stand against racism and shown openness and tolerance, but they would have recognised that immigration in the context of high unemployment drives down the wages of unskilled workers.

&gt;They would have opposed the EU, because they would not have wanted decisions about our country's future taken outside its borders and because they would have wanted to express their solidarity with the youth of Greece, Spain, Portugal et al.

&gt;The Left has lost its way and its connection to its history: the view of its traditional values expressed here is no more 'true' than Cameron's construction of his values.",0,1402907341,null,0,false,0,ci8rhf4,t3_2891zo,t1_ci8rhf4,t3_2891zo,null,1434259860,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

Unfortunately they require either total abundance (which is unlikely in the near future), or total elimination of greed (which is arguably even more unlikely).  

Putting everything in a pile and telling people to 'take what they need' has always been the greatest fallacy in Marxist theory.   It neglects everything we know about the way hormones and biology impact psychology.  It neglects the fact that we all desire more (whether it's love, happiness, resources, stuff, reputation, respect etc..) all the time, that we are rarely ever satisfied as a species.   It assumes that people are happy with only 'what they need', that they are happy being 'the same' as everyone else. 

I don't think it's capitalist indoctrination to suggest that greed is ingrained within us.  And I don't think it's naive to suggest that the only way we can move beyond it is with total abundance, meaning everyone can take whatever they want.

true,doeboy73,cnty-england,West Londoner in East London,"I responded to the points you made in your previous post (""*income/property/wealth taxes*"").
   

&gt;You don't ""determine"" anything. You simply tax the property at it's value so that naturally the wealthier people tend to pay more tax as their properties are more valuable. That and something similar in outcome, such as a land value tax.

So we would need to determine some things (property value, land value). Entirely doable, sounds like the existing council tax system. I guess simply increasing the liable rates would do it. I don't see how that negates the point I already made of it being a blunt instrument. Besides, I think we can expect Council tax rates to increase again anyway.

Wealth taxes:

&gt;It's a category of taxes that focus on taxing the net value of your wealth, such as properties, investments, savings, stocks and shares, etc...

You already addressed the property tax issue, unless you want to tax property twice. We already have taxes on savings, so I guess that would be an increase in the current interest rate taxes, via a graduated series of bands?

I disagree with nothing in that quote, I never have throughout this conversation, can you please move on.

&gt;Repeat; ""This description of how money is created differs from the story found in some economics textbooks."" - The mainstream is wrong.

This is where you take a dive of the deep end, yes the BofE says the description of how money is created is wrong in some text books (I'm assuming entry level ones) but it is mostly a technical detail. It doesn't mean this has any material effect or that the mainstreams conclusions are then are wrong. You can't use a minor technical detail, which while it may be taught to undergrads I'm sure is understood by anyone with real exposure to the field, as an excuse to throw the whole lot away.

Just to pick out some other fun bits, Steve Keen is probably not your best go-to defence as an economist who agrees with you, his work is hardly without some pretty serious and well founded criticisms. Lots of people predicted a financial crisis, didn't mean it happened how or why they said it would or that they are then right about everything. 

28 pages seems frighteningly short for the technical details of a plan what involves throwing away our entire current system. 

The links I provided were far from meant to be authoritative just some of the first (of many) I found who described my objections far more eloquently than I can. One persons shil is another's industry expert who actually has a clue what their talking about.

&gt;So I have given you sources by the Bank of England lots of different Economists

Please please stop misrepresenting the BofE as agreeing with you, I have a number of friends who work there, they would be annoyed.

The far more important argument which seems to rarely get made is the improvement in your life each £20,000 extra in your income makes:

£20,000 - A place to live, food to eat, clothes to wear.  Very limited disposable income OR savings

£40,000 - Significantly more disposable income, ability to take holidays, buy a nice car, - take part in the consumer culture (as evil as parts of it maybe) or enough savings to contemplate a future where you own a capital investment (house/stocks/shares)

£60,000 - Take part in the wider consumer culture and include investing in your own future (house ownership) or the stock market



£80,000 - ... you see where this is going, the first £20,000 is basically mandatory to actually LIVE let alone live well.  

The latter brackets improve this life, but are all achievable by the lower brackets (40,60 etc) if you are willing to cut back on something and save for others.  The 20,000 bracket will never afford a house - they cannot save.  There cost to live day to day is significantly higher than the day to day costs of someone at 80,000.

and this cost is basically what this news article is trying to articulate.  The lower end of the bracket pay a lot more in tax directly because they have nothing to invest in capital even if its a good pair of shoes which will last a year rather than a £2 pair which will need replacing once a month.

The financial and TIME cost of using a laundrette as opposed to the capital cost of buying a washing machine - which you will NEVER do it you live in rented accommodation anyway, since you probably can't afford to take it with you if you moved anyway.

Sorry, this is rapidly turning into a rant, but frankly it pisses me of that the people who create policies on these types of things have literally no fucking idea what it is like to live at the other end.

A superb example was Ian Duncan Smith (http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/01/iain-duncan-smith-live-benefits) £53 a week is totally doable, if you receive 4 weeks of it in advance and then are living on £212/pcm.  But if you only receive the £53 each week, you cannot make bulk purchases and invest in next week.  

It's a total failure of perspective and reality that these people suffer from, and they will never get it until we force them into the shoes of the people they so wrongly vilify.

Standard places to meet people are up at Mick's on the hill and if you take a bit of a ride over by Droxford to Loomies, there's a bike night every Wednesday. In good weather it's packed and it's usually got a few people around at any time. If you find anything give me a shout, me and my mate have been looking for some groups to ride with lately. I think MAG (Motorcycle Action Group) also meet up at the Churchillian and were pretty friendly when I met one or two of the guys at a Royal British Legion bikers show thing.

EDIT: Also, Portsmouth Uni have a bike society, I was going to meet up with them a while back and they're nice people.

Nor are they so bloodthirsty. Conservatism doesn't have a set of fundamental guidelines that if broken demand death for the perpetrator. Liberalism doesn't make exceptions to its main principal of 'do what you want as long as it doesn't harm others'.

The acceptance of killing in defence of religion is made much starker  by the fact that any and all human progress is a threat to religion.

But let's take it to its very furthest extent and assume the threat is a complete annihilation of any and all thought or reference to a specific religion, as if that were possible. Is prevention of that really worth killing for? How many religions have completely disappeared? Are we poorer for their absence? If we are, then why did their own adherents walk away from them? History is littered with dead religions and cults. Even the ones still alive are zombified in the west, dragging themselves along with most of their basic organs and functions removed. The religious have been happy to gut and abandon their most sincerely held beliefs for millenia when it suits them.

Step one was then to completely dismantle ALL OF IT. Anarchy set in pretty quickly as soon as the sectarian groups realised it was open season on each other.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It isn't taught though.  We see natural self-interest (the primitive version of greed) in animals, even.  If I give my dog three bowls of food right now, he'll eat them all, regardless of whether he needs them or not.  Then he'll vomit 3 hours later.  Now I'm not saying that we should do anything that animals do, but to say extreme 'self interest'/the desire for more is a purely human trait is ridiculous.  

Secondly, greed is not necessarily taught behaviour.  The Soviet Union and Maoist China (between 1949 and 1980) attempted for decades to wipe out greed, because it meant less consumer products had to be made and manufacturing could be focused on heavy industry and weapons.  But they failed to eliminate greed.  I actually own several East German textbooks as a collector/family heritage keeper, and they all say greed and consumerism are bad and evil etc...  But even after decades of that 'Communist' governments failed to eradicate it, despite literally indoctrinating people against capitalism.  

Whether the current system is failing is based entirely on whether economic growth is continuing, which it is.   It will be many decades before the advancement and wealth of developing countries reaches our own, and during that time there is no reason to believe in imminent collapse.  Population continues to rise, farming techniques continue to improve etc etc.., the idea that we are reaching the 'peak' that we can support environmentally is a ludicrous fallacy and has minimal scientific basis. 

 In the 60s people said the system would collapse in the 70s due to hunger crises.  Did it happen?  No.   Beyond earth, there is a galaxy to expand to.  Asteroids harbor water and resources, other worlds in our solar system and beyond might even have life upon them.   By the time we have exhausted Earth's supplies, we shall probably be more than ready to find them somewhere else.

Growth can continue infinitely until we have used up the resources of the universe itself.  The idea that it can't is ridiculous beyond belief.   It makes no sense.  It relies on emotion.

true,Scholafell,null,null,"Not sure why you are getting downvoted; this is actually true. Any physics student will know that rough surfaces, such as a bearded face, promote more aerodynamism than smooth ones by offering reduced wind resistance. 

A smooth surface — say, of a clean-shaven face — will cause air to stick to the front of it. This increases its wind resistance at high speeds. A clean-shaven player that is running will thus be slowed down as such.

In contrast, when a bearded player is running, thin layers of air will be caught between his beard follicles.  These follicles act as ""turbulators"" — they induce turbulence in the layer of air next to the face (known as the ""boundary layer""). A turbulent boundary layer reduces drag (wind resistance) and thus increases speed. This same phenomenon explains why [stitches in a baseball](http://www.aviation-for-kids.com/baseball-stitches.html) help it fly further. As well, [grooves in soccer balls and dimples in golf balls](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~meam211/slides/aero.pdf) that serve to roughen up their surfaces, are done so for this same reason.

As mentioned I normally tip my bike slightly to the left when I'm stopping. Not quite sure how I do this, probably a combination of angling the bars and shifting my weight slightly. That way I can brake with my right foot and put my left foot down.

Don't get into long explanations; remember the average listener isn't paying that much attention, and will tend to associate Bitcoin with negtive topics in rough proportion to the amount of airtime they get. So the main strategy is to minimise the airtime given to the negatives.

In the UK the libertarian ""taxation is theft"" line should be treated as a negative. ""Yes, there are a few people who think like that, but that is not what Bitcoin is about. Bitcoin is about...""

Use the Pixar Pitch (google for it) to structure your narrative. Once upon a time there was a banking system. Every day people used banks for financial transactions, and the greedy banks took a cut. Then one day Bitcoin was invented. Because of that people no longer need to use a bank to save or send money, and because of that the greedy bankers are being cut out of the loop, and in the end we can save a lot of money every year. (Obviously you don't say ""once upon a time"": these are your talking points in order.)

Throw in some numbers about credit cards. ""Card fees skim off around 2%. Thats like 2% on VAT, except it gets paid to the banks. 2% of my spending on cards is around £200 per year. That means I'm paying my bank around £200 per year in fees, because the only alternative is paying for everything in huge piles of cash.""

My advice is open a basic savings account (Nationwide Cash ISA 1.75% for instance) Put it all straight in there. Then open a 'Regular saver' account, a lot of people offer them with monthly addition stipulations. TSB offer a 5% monthly saver which must be fed with £500 a month, so start drip feeding from your ISA into there to take advantage of the higher interest rate.
  
I would advise looking at starting a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA (iWeb for instance) and start planning for retirement also using index trackers. Compound interest has an enormous effect over the years so starting early has an incredible effect on your wealth. In the long term the stock market will always beat savings accounts at very little risk (5+ Years). Head over to /r/investing or /r/bogleheads to learn about index investing.

true,LordMondando,null,null,"&gt;WHY? What does it possibly matter to you or me how someone else lives or chooses to spend their money?

Becuase none of it occurs in a vacuum and wealth/money/whatever currency format you want, is essentially a token of access to resources. 

I mean once you break down the fallacy that any person, however talented, resourceful, or whom's impactful in a postive manner. Doesn't appear to be justified in holding the power over resources equivalent to that a small nation. Then the question becomes how do we address it. 

&gt;You could take ALL the wealth from those richest 1%, divide it up amongst the whole 65 million of us, and we'd maybe see a grand each if we were lucky. And how soon would most of us go on a bender, maybe go to Spain for a couple of weeks, buy a big-arse TV, or find some other way to piss it all up the wall and be back where we started from before Friday?

Exactly why I'd not suggest that. But its a false dilemma to suggest its status quo or that. For one, i'd suggest significant portions of wealth would be far better spent on STEM scholarships or flood defences. 

&gt;If you are going to insist on a system where everyone is ""equal"" in all things,

I never said that, I'm confused where you got that from. 

&gt;then first you need a society that will all choose to spend their money in exactly the same way, to ensure the status-quo. Good luck with that.

Again, I don't have to comply with that 'status quo or loaded situation' dilemma.

You want me to ignore reasonable interpretations of a question just so it makes your judgements seem more valid, and you think it's *me* who's treating a particular group as special.

Sorry, no.

I've been attacked around here plenty of times for because I have a very strict and literal interpretation of equality that (I think) some people automatically assume is just a pretext for justifying prejudice, and because there are obviously people who take similar claims and abuse them to defend prejudice. Though of course I have the usual set of human-nature blind-spots about my own bad, so maybe they're right to, even though I think anything other than strict-and-literal equality is just replacing one set of prejudices with another and punishing people for what their ancestors did.

I think it's equally evil when whites are treated as automatically racist because no-one considers that there might be another explanation for whatever because they're white, when men are told they aren't allowed to defend themselves because they're just assumed better able to defend themselves because they're men, and yes when atheists are persecuted by the religious too.

And no, I don't believe there's anything morally superior about religion - I believe that e.g. people who call themselves Christians are slightly more likely to act immorally than atheists - because that has been studied scientifically, and that's the conclusion of those studies I've heard about. I'm open to the idea that some people call themselves Christians precisely so they can get away with immoral behavior, though I also believe that since most religious people cherry-pick which parts of their religions to follow and actually believe they're e.g. good Christians while ignoring claimed Christian principles, I don't think it's that simple. Really, I just think there's self-serving bias everywhere, and the variation is down to variations in circumstances.

But of course culture is a kind of circumstance, which is why I agree with Lord_Yaxley and that ""As Islam is a belief system as corrupt as any other"".

It's not the idea that muslims, like anyone else, can be corrupt that I disagree with. Nor that they often bring corrupt aspects of their culture with them when they immigrate. That's obvious, and it has always bugged me when people can't read a condemnation of e.g. forced marriage and rape without assuming there must be prejudiced motives behind it.

But then it's not surprising, really, when it's apparent that Muslims *are* being demonized. That doesn't justify turning a blind eye to bad things done by Muslims, but *that* doesn't justify the demonization of Muslims in general either.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"Yeah, I hear what you're saying, but at the same time I find it difficult to believe that ALL unemployed are in this situation - it's just the most quoted, worst-case example by certain publications with an agenda to push.

I merely debate the fact that ""eating the rich"" is a practical solution and is not just a case of green-eyed jealousy for the most part.

According to the 2013 figures, the top 10% of people earn at least 50,600 a year ... hell even in the top 5% of people, that figure only raises to 68,500. The number of what I'd refer to as ""truly rich"" (the top 1% or 2%) would number in the hundreds of thousands, no more than that. Anyway, here's the breakdown by number of taxpayers in each range ... you judge for yourself.

£50,000 to £70,000 	859,000

£70,000 to £100,000 	410,000

£100,000 to £200,000 	300,000

£200,000 to £500,000 	89,000

£500,000 to £1 million 	16,000

Over £1 million 	6,000

So who exactly are we targeting as the people who don't pay enough taxes ? Is someone earning 50k a year ""not paying enough tax"" ? Is someone earning 70k a year ""not paying enough tax""?

Pick a number, it's entirely up to you.

But what I'll tell you is even if we raised the tax burden on all those people earning 50k+ by a whole 20% more, it would bring in the princely sum of 36 billion ... enough to give every man, woman and child a whopping 564 quid each a year, or a tenner a week for arguments sake. 

Or alternatively we could fund the NHS for 3 months. That's it. A drop in the damn ocean to be quite honest.

How far do you think a tenner will go for most people? Is it really going to make everyone suddenly forget all their problems, declare the issue of inequality solved and everyone can be happy now that the rich are finally ""paying their fair share""?

Or will we just wait till everyone decides, nope a tenner doesn't really change a damn thing, we need 20, or 30 a week more? And then what do you do, as ""the rich"" already have a 60% tax burden, and there's only another 40% left ... assuming they haven't upped-sticks and moved to the South of France, thus paying precisely ZERO into the pot.

Yes, the system isn't fair, but trying to pin the blame on the rich is a temporary bandaid, nothing more. And when it's done, it's done. When you reach the point that someone earning 100 grand is paying 90% tax and taking home 20 grand only, what's the incentive for anyone to earn more than 19,999?",1,1402921125,null,0,false,0,ci8tvm4,t3_289ls0,t1_ci8tvm4,t1_ci8tmhg,null,1434260990,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If I make £1200/mo, of which I spend £600, £500 on rent+bills etc and save £200.  Keeping everything in the £600 VAT taxable for simplicity sake, as VAT is 20% then 1/6 of that £600 was being spent on tax, and 1/12 of their total income is taken by VAT.  If VAT went up to 25%, They'd need to spend £625 on the same items, or save less.  This doesn't sound that terrible for the hypothetical person who can save money but for people living pay check to pay check, the increase is even more tangible and reduces their income by a larger portion.

Mr Money-Bags who earns £4000/mo, spends £1000 and saves most of the rest will only see a smaller % rise of their income that goes to VAT.


&gt;Most of the millionaires in the world are self-made - they weren't all handed it all on a silver spoon. 

Yeah, and most of them likely had employees who were paid less than the value of their contribution to their employer, hence why the millionaire is now a millionaire.  Now they're rich and comfortable it's time to help contribute to the society they used to get there; Cameron's been preaching British values recently, and called 'social responsibility' one of them - taxation and redistribution of wealth is one of them.

It also serves to ensure a fair predictable and steady supply of new bitcoins.

Then id simply mention a couple of the consequences of the design which make it better more useful money, I.e instantly send anywhere and any amount with negligible fees, accounts can't be seized, value is derived from the market in a true free market fashion, can store your wealth behind a simple password allowing brain wallets ( yes I know their a bad idea in real use but it's the thing I found most intriguing that convinced me to research further, it's an attractive idea to lots of people. )

I'm sorry for being an old fart (I'm 46 now), but I grew up in a one-parent family, my mother relied on benefits to feed and clothe me and my brother (god, the jumble sale hand-me-downs we had to endure) ... but saving up for things was engrained on us. That's why it took me 17 damn years to save up for my house, instead of simply going into debt for the next 30, and then bleating about the interest.

However, if I'm being salaried for £200,000 I'm paying £116,641 in tax and receiving £800,000 in shares every year.  I'm probably paying 18% or 28% on those, not the 45% I should be paying.

Now also include that the company I'm making money for say Google (we like Google don't we?) offshores ALL there UK profit to Ireland. They pay NO UK tax (except employee costs), despite access to the UK market.  That is another HUGE hole.

There are vast VAST holes in our tax system which are not even remotely open to the less well off to take advantage of, before we even get to more complicated issues.

The people who are not paying tax, are those people deliberately taking advantage of LEGAL loopholes, which are deliberately in place in our tax system to allow RICH AND LARGE people and legal entities to pay LESS tax than those who cannot afford these loop holes.

There is also the whole lack of tax in the financial market but I honestly am not very well versed on that so will not go into much detail  because basically - I'd probably get something wrong and my argument would fall on its face.

To come to your final point - what is the incentive for someone to earn more than X if the tax is huge - exactly the point - stop playing CEO's absolutely retarded salaries and spread some of that pay down to the people doing the actual jobs, give the vast majority of people more spending power and let them pay more tax on their larger incomes.

But first, and before anything else when it comes to tax arguments, stop alllowing companies free access to the UK Consumer market if they are not paying UK tax properly.

Unfortunately, Pinder put Braben into a very difficult situation with regards to the rights over Elite because he specifically pursued Braben to get his official blessing for TNK despite having repeatedly told not to do so on the Elite froup on usenet and on other fora (it's been a while, but I have a vague recollection of there being something about this in the FAQ for the usenet froup).

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; However, if I'm being salaried for £200,000 I'm paying £116,641 in tax and receiving £800,000 in shares every year. I'm probably paying 18% or 28% on those, not the 45% I should be paying.

However, the value of those shares *could* be zero tomorrow. I tend to agree with you that shares payed in lieu of salary *should* be taxed as income.

What I can't agree with is someone who has some excess capital and decides to buy shares after the fact should be taxed at the same rate. He's already paid income tax on the original earnings, taxing him again at some lower rate on any interest gained is reasonable enough, taxing him again at the same rate is just exorbitant.

It's just another tax on people being responsible making their money work for them instead of pissing it up the wall, come hell or high water and fuck tomorrow we can just rely on everyone else to bail us out. It goes against everything I was brought up to believe was a responsible way to behave.

&gt; Now also include that the company I'm making money for say Google (we like Google don't we?) offshores ALL there UK profit to Ireland. They pay NO UK tax (except employee costs), despite access to the UK market. That is another HUGE hole.

Yes, it starts to get tricky with the Internet, because it's very difficult to say how that income was ""earned"" in any one country and where the tax should be paid. Is it based on the server location, the person who clicked the ads location, the source of any 3rd party goods bought by interacting with that ad? But that's not a problem with Google, that's a problem with laws that allow that situation to exist. If the government would actually employ some advisers who KNEW about how the Internet works, then maybe we could write some laws to cover this.

The  conversation will undoubtedly turn to mining if you are asked how there can only ever be 21 million or why they can not be copied. Explain that it's due to the mining process which is very complicated and you don't need to understand it to use bitcoins. 

Do not get technical. Explain mining is a lot of computers following a set of rules to validate transactions and being paid with new bitcoins in return for this work. 

There can only be 21 million and can not be copied because all transactions are checked by all miners. If 1 tries to cheat and doesn't play by the rules all other miners ignore transactions from that miner.

To be fair Adam Lallana shouldn't be commanding a fee of more than £15million. He is a good player and deserves a crack at a big club just like Allen, Sinclair, Rodwell, Moses, Lambert, and a number of others before him. 

But just because he's had a good season shouldn't mean we spend way over the odds for him. Imagine had we spent £15-17million on Charlie Adam, who to be fair is not that dissimilar a player to Lallana, albeit a lot less fit/mobile. 

Now Adam's price was £6.75mill at the time and for most people that was a fair reflection of his ability even if there were question marks over his fitness. For me Lallana is not that far ahead of where Adam was technically and tactically when we bought Charlie. So although TM are a little off on the base price with £6.6mill for Lallana, they're not far off.

One thought on that point... I think that beyond a certain spending point, as in covering the bare essentials, the NHS can suddenly make very efficient use of additional funds. That would include additional savings made through bulk purchases, reducing mistakes/errors by putting on more staff and actually investing in things which will make things cheaper/better in the long term. Saying that 25-30% of the NHS budget is just a drop in the ocean is completely mad. The fact that the government is chuffed with saving £10bn should tell you enough about that.

What you should be thinking is not how everyone could be £10/week better off, but that the country as a whole could make good use of that extra £10/week.

In hex's example: 1200/mo (AFTER tax)

600 spent on VAT goods (120 @ 20%)

500 rent+bills

200 savings.

100 spare.

Mr Money Bags: 4000/mo


1000 spent on VAT goods (200 @ 20%)

500 rent+bills

3000 savings

500 spare

Yes, Mr Money bags is paying more tax (200 vs 120) but he's paying a smaller percentage of his total income.

Our poor guy is paying 10% of his after tax income on VAT goods

Our rich guy is paying 5% of his after tax income on VAT goods (of which he is already buying more)

So is your argument the rich are paying MORE or LESS tax? since both are true.  Depends if your looking at value, or percentage.

The issue in our society the rich are already paying more in £ value, but significantly LESS in %.  Those first £20,000 or £30,000 determin the quality of your life well beyond the next £80,000


There is only so much you NEED to buy for a quality of life, after that it is optional to spend more to improve it further.

I'm not saying we need to bring everyone equal - but to just raise the bottom up.  To pay for this we remove a large portion of the current methods of tax avoidance.

and before we hear the same old argument about benefit fraud:

""The UK government estimates that total fraud across the whole of the economy amounts to £73 billion a year. UK government figures for 2012 estimate benefits overpaid due to fraud is £1.2 billion and tax credit fraud is £380 million. So just under £1.6 billion in total; less than 1% of the overall benefits and tax credits expenditure and less than benefits underpaid and overpaid due to error.""

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; Comparing personal budgeting with country-wide budgeting is pointless because the scales are completely unfathomable.

But taxation *is* on a personal budgeting level. I gave an example above where everyone on 50k (or above) would suddenly find their circa 35k take-home suddenly becoming 25k. While it's *only* an extra 20% in income tax, in real terms its 28% drop in cash in hand at the end of the day. That's a massive hit to those on the lowest end, not so much so admittedly for those higher up.

And that's assuming a wild hypothetical situation that would *never* occur in practice. At best you'd see maybe 2% or 4% increase in the top rate ... the threat of a 20% increase in tax would kill any parties voter base overnight.

My point was, AT BEST, we could fund the NHS for 3 months ... any realistic tax increase (i.e. likely to happen before the sun explodes), would fund the NHS at best for a fortnight. And that assumes those 6000 millionaires don't just move somewhere else on their private jet with a better tax situation.

The only ones who truly can't find the time to make themselves more employable or in a position to get a better salary are the disabled, elderly or ill - these are all already looked after.

Please don't think that, just because I support the responsibility of the individual, that I was born with a silver spoon. Sure, I had a good support network, but before now I was working in the back of a shitty restaurant, staying up all hours trying to devise the best study plan for maximum potential and returns.

I spent every spare minute studying materials I printed off at libraries or at my friends houses, managed to get a shitty PC off of freecycle, kept learning and when I was ready and had saved what little spare cash I had, I took the IT exams I had been prepping for and passed.

Most of the time it **is** a question of effort, it might not be as easy as looking on your smartphone, but if you really want it, you'll do it. Don't get me wrong, it's awful that just because someone doesn't have easy access to information/doesn't have a supportive network of friends and family/simply doesn't have the ability to improve their situation that they will only go so far but - as harsh as it is- that is just the way the world is.  If you can't compete, someone will do better. For someone like me, that has put the hours in to get that better foothold, it is an insult to say that we should suffer the same loss of earnings as those who haven't tried or cannot compete on the same level.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; Or you could just tie the basic income to a rate calculator like inflation?

But where is that money going to come from? Will we just print more every time the cost of living goes up? Will we just tax the highest remaining earners progressively higher and higher until there's nothing left to tax? All you'll end up with a situation of hyper-inflation like Zimbabwe, where a billion dollar bill couldn't buy you a loaf of bread.

These concepts are very easy to say in principle, but the practicalities of making it work are not so clear cut. And the only way it could work is on a global scale. One country deciding to do this would still leave it exposed to market forces out of it's control e.g. food, fuel and other imports from other countries to guarantee that quality of life you keep talking about.

true,yhkim1219,null,null,"Overall good news! 

Can't really talk about everything in the economy but basics are:

Cheaper imports (relatively speaking) - This includes OIL! Also since Britain imports way more goods, the increase in prices may slow down i.e slower inflation (this might actually offset the interest rate rises a little bit which is good for me since I have a mortgage)

Foreign people will find British goods expensive. This is actually good news for us (generally), maybe even for the housing boom as the house prices may seem more expensive. Note: These kinds of exchange rate changes usually hit the wealthy the hardest and normal people won't see much difference. 

You will generally spend less if you go on holiday: It's the period of summer holidays! good news in the short run. Plus the British usually leave the country for holidays so generally its good news.

The disadvantages:

British goods are more expensive: Bad for the businesses selling goods abroad (tbh it depends on elasticity but meh, most goods are elastic BUT trade goods are generally inelastic..). As long as the sterling doesn't depreciate to crazy amounts the jobs market shouldn't suffer. - Only thing that matters for me

The reducing of the deficit will probably slow down. More work for George Osborne in this respect. This bit is hard to explain, but generally speaking, since the Current Account will suffer even more (its deficit is around -5% now), the ability to pay off loans will be harder. This does depend rather on a lot of factors, however the depreciation of the pound doesn't usually help with reducing the deficit.


So overall, as long as the Gov's tax policies work and there are surpluses in the capital/financial accounts, this should be a benefit to most citizens of the UK!

Ah also the BoE doesn't really have much left to do except just watch o.o

* Best pub grub: The Hope &amp; Anchor on Hotwells Rd., also features a very nice terraced garden out back. Fantastic pies (brought in big pie bowls with puff pastry on top) and decent Sunday roast. Great local beer selection.  
* Best Chippy: Fish and Chips shop in Clifton village, uses daily catches. Classic.  
* Best atmosphere/ stylishness: Canteen on Stokes Croft, lots of seasonal dishes, great live music, very studenty/ arty vibe.

Yes, it's a momentous occasion and it is a very difficult tournament, but too often great players aren't as good because there is a huge discrepancy between the way they or their country plays versus their club or they are on a weak squad.

The feeling that players need to ""prove it"" on the WC stage is antiquated and stems from when the world's best players never faced each other. Pele played most of his time in Brazil, for instance. His only shot to pl,ay against top talent was the WC. With the rise of 4 top leagues and the concentration of talent in Europe, it isn't necessary to play in the WC to prove yourself against the best players.",0,1402926904,null,0,false,0,ci8viz9,t3_289snl,t1_ci8viz9,t1_ci8v7zo,null,1434261766,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

So actually, yeah, the UK should never have been involved. 

&gt;In 2003, the governments of the US, Britain, and Spain proposed another resolution on Iraq, which they called the ""eighteenth resolution"" and others called the ""second resolution."" This proposed resolution was subsequently withdrawn when it became clear that several permanent members of the Council would cast 'no' votes on any new resolution, thereby vetoing it.[1] Had that occurred, it would have become even more difficult for those wishing to invade Iraq to argue that the Council had authorized the subsequent invasion. Regardless of the threatened or likely vetoes, it seems that the coalition at no time was assured any more than four affirmative votes in the Council—the US, Britain, Spain, and Bulgaria—well short of the requirement for nine affirmative votes.[2]

&gt;On September 16, 2004 Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, speaking on the invasion, said, ""I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN Charter. From our point of view, from the charter point of view, it was illegal.""[3]

The vastly wealthy accumulate more wealth than they can spend.  They store it in tax-free places in some cases off-shore.  A quantity of this wealth is never taxed until they spend it and they either spend it where it cannot be taxed or is taxed very low so they can yield very high profits (land speculation) or they never spend it at all and it just accumulates out of the hands of the government or the societies who would benefit from it being in circulation.  Maybe over generations you get a playboy or a philantropist who spend that money, and that wasn't much of an issue when you had a few million quid hidden away, but when collectively the rich hide away £30b - it kinda starts to cause problems, especially since if you divided up that money and paid people better wages they WOULD be spending it in the economy.

When 1441 was passed the US, the UK and other signatories took this as a green light for action. The inclusion of the phrase ""serious consequences"" was debated at the meeting and widely understood to be a way to get OIC to buy-in without seen to be losing face, providing an actual united nations mandate from the United Nations. This was done but following this political matters at home for a lot of states meant that they needed to be seen to oppose US hegemony and as such reneged on their support. 

Our Dear Leader was also put in a quandary as there was a very vocal populist movement against the war and much of his own party were against it, hence the calls for a further resolution that could be unequivocal about precisely what the first resolution would entail.

The outcome of 1441 was that another resolution would have to be passed as I quote the piece in bold  **instead the UN should pass another resolution deciding on the course of action.**

The US and UK and Spain and bulgaria realised that they had only secured 4 votes when they needed 9 for a nod from the UN. They didn't pursue the next resolution because they knew it wouldn't pass and the invasion would be even harder to justify. 

No matter how you try to spin it, it was illegal. 

&gt;The resolution text was drafted jointly by the United States and the United Kingdom, the result of eight weeks of tumultuous negotiations, particularly with Russia and France. France questioned the phrase ""serious consequences"" and stated repeatedly that any ""material breach"" found by the inspectors should not automatically lead to war; **instead the UN should pass another resolution deciding on the course of action.** In favour of this view is the fact that previous resolutions legitimizing war under Chapter VII used much stronger terms, like ""...all necessary means..."" in Resolution 678 in 1990 and that Resolution 1441 stated that the Security Council shall ""remain seized of the matter.""

Which is a cost sunk by only one company, which any other manufacturers of the shirt would be able to avoid.

&gt;Exactly the same reasoning that makes stealing wrong. 

Really?! Being stolen from is an involuntary thing. Buying an England shirt is entirely voluntary.

&gt;There is a maximum price they can charge 

Which is the maximum amount that enough people will be prepared to pay. 

&gt;and a minimum price Nike can afford to sell

Which has pretty much nothing to do with determining the price it will be sold at. All it does is determine a price below which it's not worth even making and selling them at all. The only thing that determines the price is the behaviour of consumers.

&gt;Most people perceive a fair price to be roughly in the middle. 

Why? What has the price of manufacture got to do with how much a product is worth to you? Personally, I buy (or don't) based pretty much on its value to me, not its cost to the manufacturer. Do you buy other things based on the size of the markup? 

&gt; Should we ignore society's perception of fairness?

It may be your (and some parts of the media's) sense of fairness, but I'm not sure you can say it's society's.

I think the point the article is trying to make is that as a percentage, poor people pay more of their income in tax than wealthier people - something that seems counter intuitive to most people as often people only consider income tax, for which wealthier people are *supposed* to pay a higher proportion of their income. 

Whilst I disagree with you that ""The whole article just reaks [sic] of bias"", I concede it isn't the most groundbreaking or vital piece of research published this year - certainly the result isn't surprising. The one interesting point is that it flies in the face of the 'poor hard done-by middle classes' that UKIP push, inspired by the libertarians across the pond. UKIP are keen on a flat rate income tax.

We should focus on people in THIS country first. Those middle eastern countries are shit, and it's not our problem to fix their mistakes. Not to mention that they have been given many opportunities and they've fucked them all up, often electing extremist nut jobs anyway. I say let them lie in the bed they made. Once we've fixed all of our problems in the UK, we can try to fix theirs. Not to mention that us intervening led to several hundred thousands civilian deaths

&gt;Secondly, because extremism breeds in such circumstances, and that affects us directly. 

This is true. But I can't help but feel that this extremism is made worse by us interfering over there. Even Bin Laden said that he carried out 9/11 because of our involvement in the middle east. Right now it seems to be different brands of Islamic extremists against each other and vying over territory - it doesn't seem particularly targeted towards the west. So why thrust ourselves into the middle?

&gt;we'd just turn on the TV one day and see smoke rising from London, Paris, New York or Washington. Again.

In which case, we bomb the shit out of them, again. It's pretty much impossible to stop extremism or terrorist attacks, and I find it especially hard to believe that fiddling with all their affairs in the middle east will protect us. Whichever side we take, we still end up pissing a lot of people off - including folks here in the UK who see the events over there and blame us. We would do better to spend the money securing our own borders and dealing with home-grown extremism.

&gt;Thirdly, because whether we like it or not, what happens in the Middle East affects us economically. Oil, oil, oil. Whatever the evils associated with oil might be, we need it at least for the time being.

This is true. All the more reason to change the status quo. Imagine if we had spent the war money on solar panels.

If you like galleries, there are plenty in London, and the same is true of museums - if you have small children or want to do hands on things yourself then The Science Museum is a good bet. If you'd rather look at interesting, pretty things, seriously go to the V&amp;A. 

If you want to go walking and look at scenery, you could try the Lake District, the Cotswolds or if you want something haunting and remote The Hebrides, but they're very time consuming.

Shopping - Edinburgh (pronounced Edin-bruh, sometimes people pronounce it Edin-burg and get laughed at) is great for shops, both small curiosity types and malls. It's not too long until the Edinburgh festival so find out if your visit will fall during it. If you want to see theatre at all, Stratford-Upon-Avon, birthplace of Shakespeare, is home to the Royal Shakespeare Company so you could find out what they're putting on.

The larger a percentage of your money you spend on your house, the less tax you'll pay overall as a percentage as it's at such a low rate compared to VAT.

As poorer people have a greater percentage of their income spent on essentials, and some luxuries, they have a lesser percentage of their income available to spend on a house which is taxed at the lower rate.  That certainly tallies with what I see with friends/family, those with middle-income tend to spend a significant amount of money on their house as it's seen as an investment for the future.  I'd say investing in property is dramatically more common than any other low-tax investments people make.

Therefore, the only way to correct this issue would be to lower the tax rate of lower-income households, and potentially raise the amount that can be earned in each band.  OR, dramatically increase the stamp duty, and lower the tax rates across the board to match.

4. Any merchant can accept bitcoin for free in a matter of minutes, without the need for approval by anybody. There are no charge backs unless they so choose.

true,TychoBraheNose,eu,London (UCL),"&gt;This is the same argument I have with people who moan about local taxes ... you want ""the rich"" to pay in massively more to local government services simply by virtue of their income, yet they do not consume any more waste disposal, street lighting, road gritting than anyone else.
&gt;
&gt;If you want to implement a system based solely on consumption of goods and services, I guarantee you the very people you have such disdain for would end up putting LESS into the pot than they do now.

Ahhh, but that kind of system can only be fair if everyone is paid in income what they deserve. Rich people tend to employ people - there aren't many billionaires working as self-employed plumbers or electricians - they have secretaries, low-skilled employees (supermarket shelf-stackers and cleaners), etc etc, who all earn less than they deserve, to supplement the CEOs and top management positions who earn far more than they deserve. A supermarket employee is making around £7 an hour, to be generous. The employee's worth to the supermarket is in being able to work the tills to enable the supermarket to generate revenue, stack the shelves so customers have something to buy, etc. It is possible that an employee is earning the supermarket less than they are being paid, in which case they are usually fired. This is what limits employment numbers in large organisations, ""we can hire another 15 workers for £105 an hour, for a projected increase in revenue of £195 an hour - lets hire them"" or ""we could remove 12 employees, saving ourselves £84 in wages but only reducing revenue by £60 - lets fire them"".

The problem is, the people at the top are bringing in far far less than they are worth. The top management jobs at places like Tescos and Sainsburys are usually not worth what they are paid. For every manager earning over £1m a year, you could find someone equally qualified and capable of the job who would happily do it for a tenth of what its currently done for. This inflated salary is only possible because the lower earning employees are not paid what they are worth, with the surplus going to the management. The idea that a CEO working 40 hours a week with regular 'work lunches' and golf weekends, who's main purpose is delegation, is worth on average 700x as much to the company as average employees is absurd - certainly you can find someone just as capable of doing the job who is prepared to do it for a lot less. Of course, its the highest earners and managers who decide what everyones salary is, so it would be equally absurd to expect to find a fair and representative system. 

The result of the system is that has a minimum wage below the accepted living wage, with huge numbers of people in full and near-full employment who need government subsidies through benefits in order to feed and house themselves, and to actively contribute to waste disposal, street lighting, road gritting, etc. What you have are the top earners and employers underpaying their staff for the work they do, and making the government intervene to make ends meet. That government help is disproportionately paid by the middle-income earners who don't own large companies or claim many benefits. Essentially the middle earners are making up the difference when the lowest paid are underpaid, so that the richest can have over-inflated salaries.

Actually I would say we don't really have any independent committees which have anything like the power of this proposed new one. Any post with is democratically electable is vulnerable to populism and electioneering, any political appointments become a party politics game (just look to the US to see that) and any shadowy 'industry experts' are going to be pilloried in the media.

&gt;But could happen if the private banks did it with depositors money in which case they would probably become bankrupt

Number of thinks wrong with this whole paragraph, firstly and mainly all this can be accomplished by simply separating retail in investment banks, which is underway. But also you ignore the fact that with the exception of PPI almost all of those scandals had at their heart individuals looking to enrich or protect themselves and thinking they could get away with it, not giant company wide conspiracies. They knew if they got caught they were fucked but believed that they wouldn't be, increasing the penalty won't change that.

&gt;And finally if you knew how money was created you would know that electronic ""money"" = debt and debt is destroyed by paying off loans which means electronic ""money"" is created and destroyed daily.

Yes by an agreement between the issuer of the debt and the owner of the credit, normally repayment. 

You seem to be suggesting that a central bank could curb inflation by just deciding to destroy a bunch of 'electronic money' but they have no right to do so?

The money you save from not having a mortgage can be invested, or if you felt like it you could buy another property abroad after a year or two. 

As with cars, the same disparity in scaling applies. A new Volvo V40, which is a reasonable car for a couple earning £100k (with or without kids), is £19k. Scale it up to a family earning £1m and you're looking for a £190k car. That's about the price of a Lamborghini Gallardo (I think). Sure it's a fun toy, but nobody in their right mind buys a sports car as their primary car. The most expensive four door car I can think of which you could actually drive day to day in a city is a Bentley Continental GT, which is £150,000.

2.International Tracker  
3.Bonds  
  
The domestic tracker will track the FTSE 100 or the wider UK equity market to take advantage of UK growth. The international tracker likewise on an international scale for diversity. The bonds are a hedge (or a backup) for when the stock markets aren't doing so well.

Following this:

&gt; Iraq continued to fail to account for substantial chemical and biological stockpiles which UNMOVIC inspectors had confirmed as existing as late as 1998. Iraq claimed that it had disposed of its anthrax stockpiles at a specific site, but UNMOVIC found this impossible to confirm since Iraq had not allowed the destruction to be witnessed by inspectors as required by the pertinent Resolutions. Chemical testing done at the site was unable to show that any anthrax had been destroyed there.

1. A 'traditional' conflict against a nation state &amp; tyrant.
2. A guerrilla war against an ideology

The first was easy to win because our whole war machine is set up for it, the other was very hard. The problem is we conflate the two because they happened in the same place around the same time (and they are related).

The thing is our leaders didn't think enough about the second because the war that looms large over our culture is World War 2. In that war the ideologies of the losing sides came to an end with end of the conflicts because loss of the war proved the ideologies of racial superiority were incorrect (plus the Axis were exhausted). In WW2 the turn around of the Axis after the war was remarkable - Germany and Japan are now some of the most successful states on earth.

The problem in this conflict is the defeat of Saddam didn't disprove the ideology so the overall conflict continues. In fact if anything it just showed that the west isn't invincible and small groups of guerrilla warriors can have a disproportional impact.",0,1402936059,null,0,false,0,ci8zev1,t3_289t1a,t1_ci8zev1,t1_ci8u3sh,null,1434263664,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,Irmuhlay,,Sixth Form,"I did the paper - I'm actually a Year 12 A-level Further Mathematician, but my sixth form allows us to do Level 2 Further Maths if we didn't do it pre-sixth form. I haven't done factorisation or circle theorems in a while, so I was a bit rusty on those, but I figured them out eventually.

The last question was interesting. Here's what I did:

2x^2 -2bx +7a = 2(x-a)^2 +3

Expand right hand side:
2x^2 - 2bx +7a = 2x^2 - 4ax +2a^2 + 3

Subtract right hand side from left hand side:
4ax -2bx +7a - 2a^2 - 3 = 0

(4a - 2b)x + (-2a^2 + 7a - 3) = 0

I figured at this point that if both (4a - 2b) and (-2a^2 + 7a - 3) were equal to zero, then this equation would hold for all values of x. I stuck (-2a^2 + 7a - 3) into the quadratic equation:

(-7 +/- sqrt(49 - 24))/-4

a = 0.5, a = 3

Then I took the (4a - 2b) as equal to zero. Therefore b is double a, so the pairs of values are as follows:

a = 0.5, b = 1
a = 3, b = 6

Substituting these values back into the original, they work. Seems to agree with [The Student Room](http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=2715126).",0,1402936106,null,0,false,0,ci8zfna,t3_289rho,t1_ci8zfna,t3_289rho,null,1434263674,1,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,1

How old are you?

Do you have any previous work experience in the field?

Do you have any relevant qualifications?

How long will you be able to volunteer, will it be five days a week, will it be a set day/s every week for a month, a term, a year?

You mention specifically secondary schools. Do you have good passes at GCSE level in Maths, English and Science? Any further education might be good to know, too.

Finally, what is your mother's maiden name and your bank's sort code? Just kidding, but any of the above questions you don't want to answer, don't worry about it. I just splurged anything I could think of up there.

.

The first thing you need to do is to send off for your DBS check (previously CRB). This costs £44 for an enhanced check, and will take up to a month. No school will let you through the door without this.

The second thing should really be to find out who specifically could get you in at the school.
