false,Yung_Don,aberdeen,,"It's nice to see people abroad taking an interest in Scottish football! And I approve of your choice of team ;) The investment by Willie and Elaine Donald in Aberdeen to wipe out our bank debts has come completely out of the blue. The region has done very well from the North Sea oil industry and I believe it was only a matter of time before people who had benefitted from the perpetual economic boom gave something back to the community. I'm very grateful to the two of them for their gesture and hope in time that it has an effect on the pitch. Though they've got some voting power and shares they turned down board positions and made very clear that this is essentially a gift. I'd love to see other clubs have similar luck but there's not the same money sloshing around the central belt.

I think the problem, largely, is to do with population rather than systmatic mismanagement, though there's obviously an element of that. Bear in mind that attendences have declined over decades for similar reasons to other countries. However, there are just too many senior sides in Scotland. Despite a high per capita attendance at football matches the audience is extremely fragmented outside of the Old Firm (Celtic and Rangers fans outside of Glasgow contribute to this problem). It wasn't an issue when football was a huge source of entertainment and attracted the masses, but we can't cope with 42 SPFL teams in this day and age. Clubs are running on intertia, they have long histories, but many of them simply can't draw enough punters to matches and don't have the necessary individual resources. Look at the success story of Inverness Caley Thistle following the merger of the town's two tiny sides.

There's also the England problem. A lot of good young players have their eyes fixed down south and for good reason. And being literally contained within the same borders as the biggest league in the world doesn't exactly do wonders for Scottish football's image. Everyone I know also follows the EPL because it's so much better. If I'm not at an Aberdeen game I have no interest in watching St. Mirren take on Kilmarnock but I'll happily watch Sunderland against Leicester. It's also true, though, that debt seems to be the way football works almost everywhere except Germany. Scottish football is unique only in terms of the imbalance in attendences.

We should all be prepared to forgive some youthful indulgence I suppose.

Your exposition of the different genealogies of people living in Ireland is at least a constructive contribution. The difficulty is, if we began applying that reasoning widely we'd be in all sorts of bother. For an English person to make a joke about a Ballymena person would be 'racist' because they hold different genealogies (Ulster-scot verses English). For a Ballymena person to mock a Fermanagh person would also be 'racist' on the same grounds (Anglo-Irish Anglican versus Ulster-Scot presbyterian heritage). Jimmy Carr's jokes against the Welsh would be 'racist' for the same reasons. A Parisian would be barred from making a joke against a Breton, a Castillian against a Catalan, a Lombardian against a Sicilian, a Vermont native against a Minnesota settler, a Vancouver citizen against a Québécois. Indeed, half the world's (albeit lazy) humour would need to be proscribed on the basis of potential 'racism'.

And certainly, noone dare make a joke against 'Orange culture' who isn't themselves of that culture's geneology.

Woe betide the person who criticises Islamic culture for its belief in death for apostasy, or Pakistani honour killings either. Blooming ""racists"".

I take a different view.

Complete fantasy. You were doing quite well suggesting that although Migration Policy being discussed outside a climate of PC is a good thing, UKIP have not exactly advanced the state of debate and in some ways have brought the whole tone of discussion down.

Unfortunately, even a considerate thinker such as yourself is limited to what you KNOW and how much you are INFORMED on Migration Policy and hence you come to the unnecessary conclusion above.

I strongly recommend Migration Watch for more facts on Migration for example. Sir Andrew Green, Director has been on the case for over a decade and vilified but been proven right (given a seat in the Lords recently and his predictions were much more accurate than the political apologists who's predictions were thus tendentious and inaccurate).

So his track record speaks for itself.

But coming away from data and back to POLICY. It boils down CONTROLLED MIGRATION being necessary to manage the high volume numbers. It's as simple as that in theory. In practice it's very complicated and all the more complicated due to multiple-tiers of goverance super-national.

But hindsight is 20-20. Obviously if Rodgers and the club were able to tell the future, surely we would have acted differently.

But I suppose the way I see it, we can't really be angry about the decisions we made in the past, we just have to hope proper adjustments will be made going forward.

As I said - show me some figures on food banks to provide more than than 'it must be X' and *then* you can agenda hike. Otherwise I can use the same logic to avoid providing proof as well.

&gt;Yes, there are a million ways to raise extra taxes without companies abandoning their profitable operations in these isles.

Such as? If there was something that was 'that simple', Labour would have come up with it and the Tories would have stolen it.

&gt;But no, the Tories didn't burden the wealthy at all.

They're not paying a higher tax burden? Or are you talking about companies? Or are you just talking about company owners? Individuals with real money to be grabbed will leave. Companies with real money will relocate. Company owners will be less inclined to expand, at a time when we're trying to *encourage* money to come *in*.

I've only ever seen this kind of thing presented as such by those who have an interest in doing so/ polarising the situation; lump everyone you need into 'the poor' (which isn't accurate enough and doesn't work) and then lump everyone who has money (how much depends on what you consider 'wealthy') into 'the rich' (which doesn't work either for the same reason).

Churchill said once that he had some dream about dividing Palestine in a different way — a part to the Arabs, a part to the Jews, but it was a very unclear idea. Very unclear. He was not busy with that, Churchill… And then, after the war, the Labor Party took over power in England and Mr. Bevin became foreign minister, Atlee was prime minister, and Mr. Bevin opposed the Zionist movement, the idea of a Jewish majority … of a Jewish State … and he sent the others to create here an Arab country, an Arab state, with certain autonomy for the Jewish, for the Jewish settlements.*

false,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"Okay, compare: you are in house A, and will eventually move to house B.

 - House A purchased for £100,000; at that point equity is zero because loan equals value.
 - House B is 100% more expensive than house A, at £200,000
 - Additional debt+savings needed in savings until House B can be bought: £100,000.

Time passes, and in scenario#1 you get positive equity.  The housing market has increased by, say 20%.

 - House A is now worth £120,000; equity (ignoring the minuscule amount of capital you'll have paid off) is approximately £20,000
 - House B is 100% more expensive than A, having gone up equivalently by 20%, at £240,000
 - Amount needed in debt+savings until House B can be bought: £240,000 -
	 £120,000 = £120,000

So you might think you're better off because of the holy grail of
positive equity, but you actually need £20,000 more than when you
started.

I needn't bother with Scenario#2 -- it should be pretty obvious that if house prices drop, house B gets _closer_ to you, not further away.  You perceive it as bad because rather than having to find more money for the new house (which people see as simply a bigger investment), you have to money for missing equity in the old house (which people see as a ""loss"") -- but total, you are better off when things get cheaper.

The reason people don't ever see this though is because of banks.  Banks, in a rising market will let you take on mortgages they shouldn't.  They will supply the additional £20,000 for you in the positive equity case, but they will not supply it in the negative equity case.  

We have, since 2008 seen the effects of that bad behaviour -- lending to people who can't afford the loan ends in disaster.

Now, combine that with the fact that negative equity really only applies to you if you've only just bought a house, since if you've been paying it off, you likely _don't_ have negative equity, even if the market has dropped a bit since you purchased.  In truth, [the Financial Conduct Authority Risk Outlook 2013](http://www.fca.org.uk/your-fca/documents/fca-risk-outlook) said that only 4% of mortgages are actually in negative equity -- so you see the problem is nowhere near what the papers, and a few anecdotes would have you believe.  Conversely, when a housing bubble pops that is a problem for _everybody_.

I realise mine is not a popular opinion among Brits; we're a strangely house-obsessed people.  I've been bitten just as you have by negative equity.  I took a huge loss on the chin when I needed to move at the absolute worst time in the housing market, so I understand.  That doesn't mean that we should be wishing for another twenty year bubble that ends up doing more general damage than any amount of individualised good that might be attributed.  You must have read reports that point out that young people can no longer afford to buy a house, that people live with their parents until their 30s, that the next generation is likely to be first to be poorer than their parents?  These are not independent events -- they are due to the massive transfer of wealth, via ""positive equity"" in houses that has happened in the last 40 years.

It’s the whole *‘love the sinner, not the sin’* mentality.

People use views that don’t deserve respect as a reason to avoid giving respect to people they don’t like. It’s a short hop from that to feelings of superiority and conceit. Is being bigoted against bigots a good thing? Intolerant against intolerance? I don’t believe so; it isn’t progressive to embrace the darker sides of human character in order to fight them.

One big problem liberalism has is how quick it is to pigeon-hole its opponents to avoid dealing with their attacks. UKIP = racism is a frequent chant, yet the number of UKIP voters is now so large it’s an impossible argument to maintain.

The way we beat UKIP isn’t by calling them names, it’s by confronting and addressing the negative sides of immigration. A start might be just admitting that negative sides exist. That the free-movement of workers in the EU is a net benefit to the UK; that we can all agree on. But a ‘net benefit’ still means there are negatives buried in there, and if those are all felt by just one part of society, we shouldn’t be surprised if that group reject immigration as a whole.

But if you can send the wage to a country that is less expensive. You may buy twice or three times as many purchases. In real terms the migrant who sends his wages home to spend is paid two or three times the wages of the British resident.

Don't buy in to the racist, daily mail, lazy British routine. The British worker can not compete at those rates. No migrants then the wages must increase to pay British worker. Yes prices go up but the wages are used to pay for British goods and services which encourages growth.  Money in the workers pockets, means money spent, which means growth.

What exactly are these jobs that no one here wants to do? I think the issue is that immigrants are willing to work in worse conditions for less pay, so employers can offer a much worse deal for the employee, knowing that an immigrant will take the job if a native will not. There is clear evidence that immigration suppresses wages at the low end of the pay scale. 

&gt;Those Romanians now see us as racist dickheads and the people who don't care what we think (aka the dregs, the ones we don't want coming over) are the ones heading over here. Well done, Britain, we pretty much made a self fulfilling prophecy! [Slow clap].

A sensible immigration policy would make the general public feel much better about immigration as a whole. If people could be confident that we had control of our borders, I think the county would become a lot less racist as a whole. 

It is our poor handling of immigration policy over the last 20 years that has made people more racist, not something inherent in the British people.

&gt;And while we're at it, can we talk about the ""ex-pats"", or as the rest of the world calls them, British immigrants. 

All of this is completely irrelevant to the problems we have in this country. If British immigrants in Spain are causing a problem, then if is up to the Spanish government to do something about it. If they wan't to restrict the number of British people moving to their country they should have the right to.

 The fact that there is no real movement for something like that in Spain suggests they are not as big a problem as you suggest.

so its gone down from being ~ 42% of its budget to being ~ 20% of its budget in 5 years. That's a HUGE decrease, and its going to get worse. It'll probably go away entirely in the next 5 years if it keeps that up. Which is likely going to lead to company sponsorship of everything possible. Station and line naming rights are probably the most profitable thing TFL has - if they can pull in a few hundred million a year (maybe even more) from those,  it'd help a lot.

Some might say it's a bond that holds people together; all I see are (expensive) divorce rates. Others point to a public declaration of commitment - I feel that's more about the wedding than the marriage, which I care for little, too.

My girlfriend and I often joke that we're basically married. We own jointly own a property, we have life assurance policies for each other, we're join signatories to contracts, we have cats.

Also, I don't think your black and white view of ""if it blocks criminals income it must be worth it"" is useful, unless you know what proportion of criminals income it will block and how much much a criminal needs to kill someone. 

For example, if money from kidnapping ransoms only makes up e.g. £10 million income for terrorists, and for every £10million the terrorists spend, they kill 50 people, then bringing in a law that will keep £10 million out of the terrorists hands, but lead to 100 people being killed because the ransom wasn't paid doesn't make economic sense.

To me it truly means you are with one person for the rest of your life. Which is why I gave it so much thought.

For a long time I also saw no value in it either, but the fact that my wife's views on marriage aligned with my own, and that she really wanted to be married. That gave it some value to me.

There is no escape plan for our relationship now, (not that there was one before) if we have problems we deal with them. Leaving is not a solution to a problem anymore. That kind of security can change the tone of any disagreements.

We are with each other for good now, so we just have to adult-up and deal with them. 

When people in the past talked about working at marriages, I believed them but didn't really understand what that entailed. Now I know it means you have to deal with problems on a higher level, because walking away or ignoring them is impossible.

This is my take on marriage, and I think it's quite old fashioned, but it's also why it took me 5 years to get married, and also why people with 6-month relationships are probably less likely to have a lifelong marriage.

There's usually work to do, and I could stay to do it, but I can always pick it up again in the morning.

Sometimes there really is something really time sensitive that took an hour or so extra, I might leave a little earlier or arrive a little later the next day.

There is always a point where you have to relinquish responsibility at some point. If you are assigned a task that takes 4 hours of overtime, then you need to decline and make a good case that it is damaging the company.

In the interview for my most recent job, I was asked ""would you stay late for overtime?""

The student union is very good (top 10 in the country when I was there ~9 years ago).

There is research (most notably by Rogoff) that suggests that financial crisis caused recessions are deeper and followed by slower recoveries.

This time around we had not bank failures at it still took 6 years for economy to recover. Letting a bank ,that was briefly the biggest in the world, fail would make both the recession deeper and recovery slower. Also I prefer not to think what it might do to people's trust toward the banking system (although perhaps saving Lloyds and letting RBS fail would send a signal to customer that this was a one off incident and the confidence hit among retail customers would not be as sever).",0,1416834158,null,0,false,0,cmbj74z,t3_2n8ygz,t1_cmbj74z,t1_cmbilee,null,1425867272,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

With Markovic not taking off quickly, the lack of wingers to create width further up the pitch is sorely lacking and teams simply have to defend the centre to stop us.


Even when we do get width from our fullbacks we're then left exposed which creates an optical illusion of distinctly average opposition wingers becoming Ballon D'or candidates.

So are you saying consumer prices aren't higher outside the EU? Because the fact is they are. considerably so. And in this climate where 90,000 people are resorting to food banks I don't think a rise in food prices are a good idea. I mean we have people from Norway and Switzerland crossing the border to do their daily shop if they can because prices are so high outside the EU compared to inside. That's one thing the Anti-EU party fails to mention.

&gt;It boils down CONTROLLED MIGRATION being necessary to manage the high volume numbers.

I agree but here's the thing. The average UKIP voter doesn't care about controlled immigration, to them, ""immigrants"" are Slavs and Romanians who are coming over here and ""stealing our jobs and stealing our services"" and they want them gone. Now the average Pole you meet on the street is actually the type of immigrant you *want* here. They tend to be skilled, hard working, and no job is under them because even the lowest paid job pays better than a decent job back in Poland. A lot of these people are self employed and are paying more into the state than they take out. If these people were British we'd be saluting them as upstanding citizens. 

The real problem however are not the hard working, self employed, nose in dirt Poles. The problem are the flood of unskilled immigrants, usually working in camps on farms picking soft fruit on farms. The country is flooded with those immigrants. They're not paying taxes, they're not giving anything back to Britain, most don't speak English, most don't even bother interacting with the locals. Their pay goes straight to Poland and when something goes wrong on the farm it's the British state that picks up the bill. The problem however that the people dominating the debate, those flapping around UKIP as if Farage is our new god, don't really see any difference between Magda the hairdresser and Igor the fruit picker. To them, they're all ""bloody immigrants who should fuck off out our country and give us back our jobs"", jobs, by the way that the people in question have been out competed on (the migrant was more skilled than the local) or ones where the locals are reluctant to apply for because the pay is seen as too low and/or the work is too hard. Every time I meet a Ukipper (they tend to be that because UKIP seems to be the only party who wants to sweepingly slash immigration without killing anyone) and they don't seem to make any distinction between skilled and unskilled migrants. Now if we do cut immigration, hopefully by chucking the unskilled labourers, then I think the average Ukipper will be rather disappointed to see what happens. There'll still be a Polish deli on Clark street, Polish plumbers will still be operating, the Polish lass working in the coffee shop will still be there and all those ""bloody poles"" they keep seeing will still not have gone. 

The immigration debate, I'm afraid, is being dominated by people who believe in ""kicking out the bloody immigrants"" rather than keeping the ones who actually are a plus to Britain, and UKIP are more than happy to fan this feeling to gain more power. Who they consider to be an immigrant depends to the person but I think Mrs Kirsten Farage, Nigel's wife, would be shocked at the amount of UKIP supporters, or people who agree with UKIP on immigration who make no distinction between her and a Romanian gangland leader.

I guess that depends on how far you want to polarise and exaggerate the issue in an attempt to dismiss it - but that doesn't mean it's not valid (or will go away). Any tax increase and the effect would really depend on the tax - and the hike. U2 didn't leave Ireland tax-wise because they suddenly didn't like Ireland. UK got a lot of companies to move here by offering them tax breaks that other countries couldn't - we don't want the same to happen to us as we won't be able to bitch about it too much because we've already been doing it to other countries (hence nobody can really lambast U2 for leaving Ireland for a better tax-rate because Ireland had already been doing the same).

&gt;Many are very profitable and could be comfortably taxed extra.

That's a generalistic assumption. If you can give your shareholders (say) $1 extra per share because you saved on taxes by moving to Iceland, then that's a danger to be avoided by the government taxing you were you are right now.

&gt;Many pay next to no tax at all.

Again, depends on the tax. It's not like you (or a company) 'pay tax' or 'don't pay tax'. Corp is easy to avoid for a multinational, and profits can be funnelled abroad....but there's plenty more.

&gt;Sounds like you've swallowed the corporate propaganda line there.

Or I just might be seeing both sides of the coin instead of making it all about us vs. them, and trying to avoid a conversation that someone has started by assuming the conclusion is a given.

&gt;Check the Parliamentary motions of an MP like Galloway. He proposes new taxes regularly.

He also spouts a lot of guff that gets him dismissed as a carpet-bagger, with some justification.

Not going by the points you've made so far - you need something more substantial, which brings us back to my original post - nobody has produced real figures either way on food banks, and until they can it doesn't really mean much because it can be used/ abused by both sides.

Certainly, if you are rich enough to pay the ransom, you could have taken security to prevent your kidnap in the first place. Being wealthy or important would make you a high value target actually worth kidnapping. If kidnapping normal civilians never results in a payout, terrorists wouldn't be so incentivised to capture them. Thus it actually protects the normal people. 

Either way, nobody should be funding terrorist organisation, at all, ever. Yes it sucks to get caught, but I can't see any rationale where paying out is a sensible thing to do. Your financial argument doesn't make sense IMO since all of the money is going to a bad cause in one way or another. If it doesn't go towards catching more hostages, it goes towards buying weapons which will kill other people, or towards funding larger attacks, or towards training, or recruitment. All of which hurt others or help the terrorist organisation. 

It's brutal but IMO the 'no negotiation with terrorists' principle is absolutely solid. They are not reasonable, and giving them what they want can never be the best thing to do. ",0,1416835467,null,0,false,0,cmbjjck,t3_2n8vu0,t1_cmbjjck,t1_cmbi7sj,null,1425867102,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Whilst working in IT for my (then) local city council (around 1999-2001) the whole department (~10 people) were putting in between 3 and 6 hours OT a day, some as part of the Y2K compliance stuff, some as part of a hardware refresh and some as part of normal operations that couldn't be done during business hours.  Most of it had never been planned for thanks to some short sighted forecasting and planning by Corporate Services and they started questioning the OT bill.  We were asked to give up one hour per day as time in lieu rather than as billed OT to reduce the wage and contractor costs, to a maximum of 10 days worth of time owed.  We got an extra two weeks of paid holiday, and Corporate Services got a reduced OT bill so most of us were happy with it.


A few years later, whilst working for another employer (still in IT) I was TUPE'd between companies.  The new company had a standard clause in it's contracts that we would work five hours per week for free before claiming OT.  Those of us who'd TUPE'd took our existing contracts with us, so we were getting paid a potential 5 hours a week more than our colleagues, but we were getting a lower salary.  The union got involved and we were given the choice of taking a one-off pay rise to bring us in line with the rest of the department or staying on our existing contracts and claiming the OT.  I took the first option as I was one of two or three people who were getting 30+ hours a week in OT for managing some (public facing) banking systems out of hours, and with the pay rise was slightly better off.",0,1416835499,null,0,false,0,cmbjjn8,t3_2n9887,t1_cmbjjn8,t3_2n9887,null,1425867098,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Both the Nazis and these groups invent a self-deluded global threat against their own identities (i.e. scaremongering), which is then utilised as momentum to declare an enemy (Muslims/ Jews).

A cynic might think it has something to do with the vast majority of their advertising revenues coming from active fund managers...

For curated lists of passive investments:

https://www.vanguard.co.uk/

http://monevator.com/low-cost-index-trackers/

http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/index-tracker-funds (take their ""top picks"" with a healthy pinch of salt)

As for *which* active funds to use, if that is your preference...

I undertake my firm's research for this, and it's time consuming and draws from a number of sources, including meeting the people managing the money and so on. My preference is for managers who stick to their remit, have a long track-record of outperformance(not three or five years but ideally ten plus) and actually do something that looks different from the index they are most similar to. The risk here is that the more different they are from the index, the more chance they have of getting these big calls wrong.

Hargreaves Lansdown have ""master portfolios"" which should be taken with an equal pinch of salt to their preferred passives, and most platforms/stockbrokers have a similar thing.

Can confirm, the Glasgow Subway operates this way. The driver pushes a button to close the doors, and the train drives automatically to the next station.

This is because some of the platforms are slightly shorter than the trains, so the train has to be stopped in exactly the right place for all the doors to open onto the platform. Also, the subway curves up and down a lot, with all the stations being on the crest of a slight hill. This makes stopping precisely quite difficult, hence the automatic operation.

The drivers just sit there reading a book, check the doors are clear, then close them and the train moves off. They're also there for safety, in case the train stops in the tunnel between stations.

Because [the Glasgow Subway trains are quite curved](https://changehere.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/dsc05138.jpg), sometimes people step just inside the train, thinking their entire body is in, then the door hits them on the back of the head.

I see lots of people claim that we didn't replace Suarez adequately. Apart from Sanchez and Falcao, who was available? Swansea wanted to hold on to Bony, I don't think he was an option. If he had forced the move we would've probably ended up paying at least 25m for him. I'm sure most of us wouldn't have been happy with that because, like Balotelli, he's not really that good of a suit for us. We're hardly gonna spend around 50m on Cavani, aren't we?

I think I changed as a person quite significantly for the better in the time I was with my wife and became more sure of what I wanted, which made it seem like a possibility. (not that marriage is the 'better' path, but rather her influence was so big it made me understand why people want to marry)

I don't think individualistic culture has led to less marriages, just an increase in divorces, because people don't give marriage the respect it used to have. I'm sure that people used to be stuck in unhappy marriages for the wrong reasons, but it's a shame that by getting rid of the stigma of divorce, we also removed some of the finality of marriage.

I know it's wrong for me to judge but when society internalizes that you just ""get out"" of a marriage, it cheapens something I have given so much time and thought to.

Everyone has seen people get married and know it will only last a few years, because to many people now, Marriage and having a long relationship are synonymous, which is why I respect people who are in your situation, but I absolutely have no sympathy for people who get married after a very short time and then predictably divorce some time later.

If my own marriage were to fail, I would have to confront what I should or could have done differently. ""I didn't know what I was getting in for"" is not an excuse I can use. It often seems to be with short lived marriages.

What are you talking about? He played the diamond yesterday and unlike this subreddits opinion, it wasn't the holy grail of football tactics that will propel us to the top of the table.

Sure, I'd like to see how we look with Lucas or Can in for Gerrard but potentially turning the captain of the club against you when you're already under pressure isn't such a good idea. We paid a lot of money for Lovren, a player who was among the best defenders in the league last season, so I understand why we are persisting with him - though I would be disappointed if we don't see Sakho given a chance when he returns from injury. People give Glen Johnson a lot of shit, but he hasn't been bad this season, he isn't offering a lot going forward but at least he's capable of stopping a cross this season unlike /r/LiverpoolFC golden boy Alberto Moreno who is usually five yards away from the winger and refuses to commit his body to any challenge (he'll be great for us in the future but I understand why he isn't starting every week.)

The reality is, defending aside, no manager would have us playing any better than we are now. Without Sturridge we lack the finish to our attack, Balotelli does not fit our system and I sincerely doubt Rodgers wanted him at the club. Borini is not good enough and Lambert wasn't bought to play in this role.

I'd rather we wait it out with Rodgers, see if we can bring Origi back in January, sign another striker who fits our system or see if Balotelli can adapt to our game. If we bring in a new manager now we enter a whole other period of transition which will set us back another year or two.

false,findersSneakers,null,null,"Ok, I recognise Muslims are very diverse (although I maintain that doesn't prevent the possibility of Muslims as a whole exhibiting differences on average from non-Muslims), but my big question is it ever valid to make observations about group differences? With the German / Italian job example of course when you have the individual data (e.g. a job interview), of course you don't need to rely on stereotypes. But if you were say an advertising executive from Italy trying to decide whether an Italian advert would go down well in Germany, then you may very well find it useful to look at stereotypes to give you an idea of the differences between the cultures.

My personal bugbear is that when people (I'm counting you as someone like this) make the admirable attempt to prevent blanket and untrue assertions about groups, they go too far the other way and start to deny that noticing average differences between groups is in any way valid at all. I'd like to see a happy medium.

So yes, OP's use of the term 'Muslim culture' was inaccurate, because Muslims are far more diverse than the Birmingham residents he's talking about. What if he had said 'Recent immigrants and their descendants hailing from poor Muslim communities in South Asia'? As this is what he really meant. I'm interested in whether this would be any more acceptable to you.

Also notice he's not saying they're bad, he's saying they're ethnocentric and hostile to outsiders.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;People think UKIP are proposing some sort of radical vision for the country (kick them all out! white is right! etc) when really they're advocating the same immigration system that pretty much every nation in the world has outside the European Union.

You're right, but here's the problem, many of the people who are voting UKIP are voting for them because they believe UKIP will enforce a ""Kick them all out"" policy. The majority of the UKIP supporters I have met don't know *any* UKIP policies except for immigration and leaving the EU and seem to believe the best way forward in Britain would be to kick out ""all these bloody immigrants"" (whilst of course, their definition of ""immigrant"" varies somewhat to not include foreigners they actually like). They don't give a shit about ""filling skills gaps"" or the ""Unskilled labour market"". They see the immigrants as the source of their problems and they don't want to differentiate between the Polish lass who's opened her own hairdresser and is paying her taxes and the Romanian who's living and working on a work camp in a fruit farm in lieu of more expensive machinery.

In my experience with talking to a UKIP supporter the average UKIPper doesn't actually know any other policy UKIP has other than ""kick out the immigrants"" and ""leave the EU"". They're not like the UKIP supports on reddit who've bothered to read the manifesto and have agreed to it. Seriously, every time I've asked a UKIP supporter in flesh space what their other policies are, they are left speechless, eventually admit they don't know, but then say they don't care because those two policies trump all and Farage is a fine upstanding man of the people (who's also an ex banker worth £49 Million). And UKIP don't care that a vast swathe of their supporters don't know their other policies and if you get the chance to ask Mr Farage (like I do), he quickly dodges the question. Which is wise considering that their manifesto include things like:

* Scrapping the Department of Energy and climate change (because action on climate change costs too much and they don't believe in it)
* Reducing Barnett Formula spending and give devolved parliaments and assemblies further tax powers to compensate (which in reality would mean cuts in services because on top of the tax the home nations pays to Westminster, they'll also have to pay their parliament/assembly rather than having the money they already pay redirected to their parliament).
* Repeal the Climate Change Act (because, again, they never really believed in all that ""science"" stuff and believing in global warming means they'll have to spend money).
* Supporting a diverse energy market including coal, nuclear, shale gas, geo-thermal, tidal, solar, conventional gas and oil (because the damage fossil fuels does just getting them out of the ground doesn't exist, let alone the damage caused actually burning them).
* Supporting a simplified, streamlined welfare system and a benefit cap (which is a policy that we complain about the Tories doing).
* ""Overcoming"" the unfairness of MPs from devolved nations voting on English-only issues (This I agree on, and I am a Scot. If it doesn't affect Scotland why should we vote on it? Likewise, [why should English MPs have the right to overrule the Scottish Parliament and welsh and Northern Irish assemblies that, by the way, they still have and can use at any time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmx-KBTs-Ks). But I guess that issue is irrelevant. It's the 59 or so Scottish MPs voting against the 508 English MPs that are the problem, not the 508 or so english MPs being able to overrule and shut down the devolved governments at will without a say from the Welsh, Scots or Northern Irish).
* Repealing the Human Rights Act and replace it with a new British Bill of Rights. The interests of law-abiding citizens &amp; victims will always take precedence over those of criminals (What this ""Bill of rights"" will actually contain we don't know. Nobody would actually disagree with the Human Rights Act if they actually needed to use it. What will this new, tougher bill of rights contain pray tell? Forgive me, I get rather suspicious when people want to make changes to things that affect my rights).
* UKIP recognises and values an overarching, unifying British culture, which is open and inclusive to anyone who wishes to identify with Britain and British values, regardless of their ethnic or religious background (If you can define a definite ""British"" culture in what is effectively a multinational state I would like to hear it. Is it just a byword for ""English"" like it seems to many, or is it a completely different invented tradition? I'm curious).

Then there's things that farage has said that actually go against the manifesto on the Website.

The website says: UKIP will ensure the NHS is free at the point of delivery and time of need for all UK residents.

[Farage says he wants an American style Health Care system.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9AshxSLNRQ). Interesting how the party he leads says one thing and he says another. I don't trust a man whose party he leads says one thing and he says another because to me that speaks of hidden intentions.

[Farage also says he is in favour of cutting back workers rights.
](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/nov/12/what-nigel-farage-really-thinks-ukip-video)

You can vote vote UKIP simply for immigration but once that's said and done their other policies, which are basically more hardline Tory policies, will be enacted.

We need to deal with immigration, I never actually said I'm fine these numbers, but I think there is a disconnect between UKIP's vision, the Average UKIP supporter's vision, what their leader says on and off camera and reality in general. UKIP knows the average UKIP supporter interprets their policies and vision differently, but they don't care. They want votes, they want power, and if that means pandering to ill informed, actively ignorant, knee jerk reactionaries, so be it. But I personally want something in between the two. I want to control immigration without having a knee jerk policy where we don't differentiate between the immigrants paying their way and the ones who aren't. The heart and knee has been relabeled the head. And I don't want to vote for a party that hushes up it's other policies (which are oddly like a more hardline tory manifesto, which if that was known would make them unelectable) and has it's party leaders openly disagreeing with it's toned down manifesto to deal with immigration in a seemingly sweeping manner.

I'm 100% opposed to privatisation but people who think Cameron and his pals are the problem really need to do a little research. It was the Blair administration that introduced PFI and so many more initiatives that undermined the core principles of the NHS.

These protesters are striking for more money to be ploughed into the NHS but that's not what's really needed. Fewer useless bureaucrats are what's needed. But you can't expect the strikers to stand there criticising people who can, all too easily, make their lives hell.

I am sorry, but this simply is not the case. Feminist nonsense. This is dangerous, extremist stuff. This is why feminism has never developed as a credible political force, despite decades of trying. 

Women need to get away from the fact that men are more than paedophiles or rapists. What society normalises sexual violence? Certainly not this one. 

It is women who objectify their own bodies. Just look at Vogue/Cosmopolitan or any of the litany of flesh laden bitchy women's magazines.

The idea of the Act is to reduce the amount of pollution we produced over time, and one way of doing this is the use of carbon tax and trading schemes. These essentially limit the amount of carbon that a business is able to produce. 

The problem with this is that it makes the cost of doing business higher for UK producers, and in the end this shifts production oversees, meaning the UK economy loses out.

Even worse, the places that production moves to, China for example, usually have far worse environmental regulations when it comes to manufacturing, and end up causing much more pollution than they would if the manufacturing had been done in the UK. Pollution is of course a global problem, so it doesn't really matter where the pollution is created, we all lose out in the end.

Switching to BT when I did it at least 8 years ago now was very easy, it only took 1 phone call with no fuss or hassle. They had an engineer our promptly and I was switched over very quickly. Since then they upgraded me to the 50mb download fibre with BT Infinity once they had installed it in my area and several months after that they once again upgraded me for free to the 75mb better version of Infinity once that was ready to go. Both times the Engineer arrived on time and was done quickly. No mess or fuss and like I said no cost.

I also moved house nearly a year ago and they simply transferred my existing deal to my new property. They had it done within 2 days all working perfectly.

On top of that I have never had issues with speed or poor performance and on the rare occassions where the net did drop out, it was always in the middle of the night (presumably the best time for maintenance) and it was always back up before expected.

&gt;*When it comes to trade talks, Britain often has no place at the table. Instead there’s a suave Eurocrat sitting there*

&gt;*In today’s speech on the European Union, previewed in this morning’s Times, Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary, will make a surprising and telling point.*

&gt;*It is that many of the rules handed down to British businesses and consumers by Brussels have often (and increasingly) been in turn handed down to it by higher powers. This means, he argues, that we would have more influence outside the EU than within it.* 

&gt;*We could rejoin some top tables*

In fornt of him you have Skrtel and Lovern. I've never been a huge fan of Martin's and I think that he's just not suited to the set up. He is immense in a sitting defense where he just gets rid of the ball. The extra exertion of playing actual football leads to numerous mistakes. Year on year he makes the most defensive mistakes and it's time to drop him. 

Lovern was brought to be the leader at the back but he just seems all over the place at the moment. Needs to step up and start bellowing orders to everyone around him. Maybe he isn't comfortable with how he's playing or is worried due to him being the new guy but time to step up and be the leader he was bought to be.

The Fullbacks. As they are auxiliary wingers, just watch the positioning and get a challenge in. Too many times they are passed too easily due to poor positioning, not getting proper challenges in or by just kick and rush tactics.

Finally is the screening player, Gerrard. As a DM he is shocking. Remember how we were shocked when Benitez said he couldn't play in his central midfield? Well as always, Rafa was spot on. Tactically Gerrard is hopeless. He was and in essence still is a number 10. Physically he can't play that role for 90 mins, but so what he can for 45 or the final 30.

I do have some concerns about this compared with selling BTC on localbitcoins;

On localbitcoins, pre-existing traders have buy orders, where they will purchase BTC for a set price. If you like their price, you can sell to them with confidence that they are unlikely to pay with a stolen bank account or funds as they have a documented trade history, on the localbitcoins site. You do not need a prior history to do this or tick lots of ID options as you are selling BTC, not paying with cash or putting up a trade classified. It also means you do not pay any fees but this is reflected in the price the buyer will offer for your coins.

With the bittylicious approach, you may benefit from a higher rate per coin but there does not seem to be any way to vet the buyer of your coins, you are trusting bittylicious to do that for you. If the buyer, pays with a stolen bank account, what is to stop clawbacks from happening, if/when the police get involved. Even if they go through the additional ID checks with bittylicious, it probably won't take them long to build up a profile that will allow them to purchase several thousand pounds worth of coins before they carry out a 'run'. 

Criminals conduct this approach on sites like ebay, where they will carry out a few hundred trades before having a big pay day. 

I personally would rather trust someone with 500+ trades and 8+ months trading history over someone who has turned up to buy and after a week or so and having sent in some fake ID, can buy my coins with stolen money.

Do bittylicious have any plans to provide safeguards against such attacks such as insuring the trade or providing other mitigating factors?",0,1416841794,null,0,false,0,cmblqkm,t3_2n98cp,t1_cmblqkm,t3_2n98cp,null,1425865989,3,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,3

Last season we had Suarez and sturridge so we played to their strengths. I know our current strikers are not even close to their levels but we need to play to the strengths of the players we have now, which I don't think we are. I personally don't know what will make our players click but passing the ball between skrtel and lovern for 75 minutes is not it. 

Now I'm not part of the whole Rodgers out brigade but I do agree with the fact that he is stubborn and doesn't change his system. He justified his lineup against Madrid saying they deserved that start but their performance against Madrid didn't warrant a start against Chelsea? 

Big Sam has said this but good managers, at least in my opinion, will tinker with their formation and lineup depending on who they play, mourinho is great at it, Rodgers however continues to play out of the back, we don't drop back regardless of who we play, our ""tiki-taka"" is always in our defensive third.

Since when is equal rights for the Irish language considered 'special rights'?

&gt; Its becoming clear that these might be relatively new found words in your vocabulary and so still provide some excitement to you when using them. We should all be prepared to forgive some youthful indulgence I suppose.

There you go with the belittling of other people again, yet you cry and cry if I say fuck or call you a cunt.

&gt; Your exposition of the different genealogies of people living in Ireland is at least a constructive contribution. The difficulty is, if we began applying that reasoning widely we'd be in all sorts of bother. For an English person to make a joke about a Ballymena person would be 'racist' because they hold different genealogies (Ulster-scot verses English). For a Ballymena person to mock a Fermanagh person would also be 'racist' on the same grounds (Anglo-Irish Anglican versus Ulster-Scot presbyterian heritage). Jimmy Carr's jokes against the Welsh would be 'racist' for the same reasons. A Parisian would be barred from making a joke against a Breton, a Castillian against a Catalan, a Lombardian against a Sicilian, a Vermont native against a Minnesota settler, a Vancouver citizen against a Québécois. Indeed, half the world's (albeit lazy) humour would need to be proscribed on the basis of potential 'racism'.

I'm all for comedians using jokes like Jimmy Carr does - it's their job - they can be a little controversial if they want to, as long as its playful. The thing is - Gregory Campbell is not a comedian. He is a politician with a long *long* history of hating the Irish or the Irish cause in the north for equal rights. It's not his *job* to crack jokes in Stormont. *Especially* at the expense of a language that the British helped kill off, and to this day are refusing to treat with respect - therefore he's making light of something still being subjugated. Also; it's not racist for an English person to joke about someone from Ballymena etc - as long as it wasn't joking about their culture or background etc - it depends on the context of the joke.

The context for Gregorys joke was this: A politician who has a long history of hatred against anything with even remote connotations to Irish or Irish history - an example for you; 

&gt; Campbell also tried to pass a motion in the European Parliament to ban the word ""Pravda"" from the Italian dictionary. While the motion was unsuccessful, Campbell promised to continue his fight, saying ""The use of this word shows Italy's support for terrorism. I'm surprised the British government has not forced the Italians to withdraw this word, as well as others which sound similar to words used by the IRA.""

This was after Kia announced they were building a concept car called 'Provo' after the  Italian word 'Pravda'. It's just lunacy. [*Here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTbebWrj560) is an interesting video of him loading a gun - saying he would be out on the street, armed, if Britain withdrew from Ireland.

CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.

CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

CJ383 Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. More supported accommodation should be provided for women on release to break the cycle of repeat offending and custody.

CJ384 Pregnant women in prison are particularly vulnerable and the scheme provided by the charity Birth Companions, which visits pregnant prisoners once a week, stays with them through birth and gives them support afterwards, should be extended to all women who wish to use it, with government funding.

But the minute it has a real tangible effect on the way you treat someone or affects their opportunities (as in employment), then it's no longer ok to do so *for such a large group*.

For example, a generalisation that East Asian people are unable to tolerate as alcohol. This stereotype is fine in most situations because it doesn't really matter and is harmless. As an East Asian myself, I am fine with it. It won't affect my future prospects or affect anyone's attitude towards me (in any way that matters, ability in drinking games being an example of something that is affected but doesn't matter).

What OP is talking about is not harmless. He is making a baseless generalisation on a *very large group* from limited interactions and based on his wording, he fully intends to apply these generalisations to all Muslim people he encounters in the future. It colours his perception and affects the way he treats them. He will be un-trusting of them and defensive.

This is subjective, but in my opinion, being ethnocentric and hostile to outsiders seems like a bad thing. I don't see how that could be a positive trait.

I was careful to mention *large groups* because, of course, if we restrict the parameters of the group sufficiently, it no longer becomes a baseless generalisation and begins to become a statistical observation. So like you said, if he specifically said something like ""2nd generation immigrants from poor South Asian Muslim communities in the Birmingham area"", then I will concede that he probably has had enough interactions to form a general idea of this specific group of people.

In that case, even negative generalisations are fair game in my opinion, because he would then be adjusting his expectations based on a significant number of real experiences (he has sufficient data points to form a correlation, to put it another way).

Just to make one thing clear, I am not at all trying to stop people from making big sweeping generalisations. Everyone is free to do that if they really want to. Free speech and all that. I do it myself all the time. I am only making a big fuss about it because in OP's case, it seems like his entire opinion on Muslim people as a whole is being shifted into the negative.

I think it's a shame if he ends up holding a life-long prejudice against Muslims based on that, and ends up not interacting with the many good Muslims out there around the world that may enrich his life. I merely hope to guide him away from that, and to keep an open mind about Muslim people in the future.

Moreno/Manquillo don't really need upgrading, they just need to develop.

Lovren/Skrtel are good on their day, but are being awfully inconsistent.  We could use a proper GOOD CB, but there's not too many of them on the market for a reasonable price. 

Mignolet is definitely upgrade-able. 

Sturridge is great, but he's essentially dead. Lambert/Borini/Balotelli aren't good enough to start all the time. We need a proper good striker.

Raheem is good as a winger, but apart from him, Markovic isn't PL ready yet and everyone else we play there is being played out of position. Hell, even Sterling doesn't want to play on the wing.

So basically, in my opinion, we need (in order)

1. Goalkeeper

2. Striker

3. Centre Back

4. Defensive Midfielder

5. Winger

If he truly adapts, recognizes what we have and how best to deploy them and sees positive results that will do wonders for his confidence. If that happens we could have a smart manager who is not afraid to try things and that would be a long term solution to our manager needs. BR needs to realize that he has to evolve his strategy to fit the players he has this season. He probably realizes that but his game plans have not reflected that.


He needs to do one thing first: let Gerrard sit more than he plays and bring him on much later in the game if required. This is a decision that takes guts, but once that is done and behind him, he can focus on the rest of the team. My personal opinion is that the young group, the future of Liverpool, need to gel without Gerrard. 


As long as BR can show he is making changes and showing better results the owners will give him another season. If he can show improvement with a core younger group he will surely be back. What he cannot afford is relegation. Evolve or die.

-Interest free loans; I think it would be good for small business and increase competition.

-Re-industrialisation; I'm not sure how being more self sufficient in raw materials is an antiquated idea.

-Public financing of political parties; I think this would help stop the influence of business and trade unions on political parties. I mean it's not a major thing needing done here compared to the USA.

-Regulation of the financial market and scrutiny; I think more audits of the banks, empowering government financial agency and punishing bankers who commit fraud and who are willfully ignorant.

-Student fees; I admit that this is perhaps hard to achieve, but indebting people for wanting to get an education should not be the norm.
 
-Infrastructure; build more rail and road links between Scotland, the North of England to the South and also building an Irish sea tunnel.

-Recycling; This isn't state mandated recycling with Stasi recycling police, it's more of slowly phasing out general waste bins and more government campaigns to support of it.

-NHS PFI; This would be a long term goal of paying of a small piece of the contract at a time.

-Less interventionism; I'm not sure where you get the idea that less interventionism equals more financial interventionism. 

-Europe; Our future is most definitely with europe are main import and export partners lie there and instead of alienating them we should become more friendly with them. This doesn't mean joining the Euro or joining Schengen but at least instead of threatening leave if we don't get reform sitting down and trying to propose new treaties that better for the UK and the other EU countries.

-More investment in the NHS; Alas I unfortunately don't know how we could do this.

-Tax loopholes; Well I think that corporations should pay their fair share and should not circumvent a country's tax laws. Also buisness that come to Ireland like Google, Amazon and Apple do a disservice to there mainly US based customers by not paying into their countries coffers.

-Social Housing; I think affordable housing is cost worth bearing, as it helps people get on the rung of the housing ladder.

I'm more of a thinker when it comes to these issues, so I was just dealing with what I think could help our country. Cost didn't factor into it.

The last few years the Boston Red Sox have been developing one of the best (if not the best) farm systems (ie Academies) in baseball.  They have a glut of promising young players, (Mookie Betts, Xander Boagerts, Christian Vazquez, Henry Owens, Ed Rodriguez, etc) that will be able to contribute now or in the near future for the Major League minimum salary.  In addition, they have VERY FEW long term commitments past the 2015 season.  Because they have a foundation of very cheap players, they are able to spend a ton of money this season, potentially blowing past the luxury tax salary cap for one year before coming back down due to expiring contracts.

The reason for the troughs in performance (they won the World Series in 2013 before being one of the worst teams in 2014) is due to entrusting the club to these young players a little too early.  Many of these players who they thought could replace expensive veterans that departed following the 2012 and 2013 seasons just couldn't quite cut it (Jackie Bradley Jr) or needed more time (Xander Bogaerts).  Now that Bogaerts has a year of experience under his belt, and they still think he can be one of the best players at this position as soon as next year, they are complementing their young, cheap core with very good (albeit somewhat expensive) veterans in an attempt at a long string of division titles and postseason appearances as their best prospects reach the Majors (Betts, Swihart, Vazquez, Owens, Rodriguez).

How will you avoid this system just further entrenching the existing parties by giving them the lion's share of funding?

If you decide how much funding a party gets *solely* by how many votes it gets then you are creating a circular loop where the big parties get the most funding &gt; get bigger &gt; get more funding... You see what I'm getting at.

One way to solve this is to have certain criteria the parties have to meet to enable them access to amounts of funding. 
For example, you could pay an amount for each constituency they have a candidate in. Then give bonuses for other things like ""having 10/20/30 candidates"" etc.

false,madeinacton,null,null,"The unpalatable truth of our health service is that to really reform it in a way that will bring down long term overall costs and improve the service - is that it requires a level of upfront investment that has to come from outside the public purse. Even if the level of money needed did come from us, too many self interest's, political point scoring and poor commercial decisions would poorly allocate the funding. 

Healthcare needs to transform to be data driven, personalised and open to technological disruption; this article gives an indication of some of the current opportunities: http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/20/healthcares-big-data-opportunity/

Unfortunately the nature of politics and the top down system means that our arguments revolve around consistently adding more staff and more targets increasing bureaucracy instead of seeking new innovative solutions with upfront investment. The state is petrified of spending large sums of money on the information systems and technology that we really need, due to past mistakes made when areas such as cloud computing and big data did not exist and political fallout associated with it. 

It could be argued that we should fund the transformations we need through taxes, but they won't even scratch the surface of the levels of investment required or will see tax rises so high that the country will bankrupt itself; the alternative is to not make the service free at the point of use which is political suicide. 

The only way I see the 10 billion or so needed upfront investment being raised is through private capital that will see a return on efficiency realized, i.e private tendering of contracts. A company will have no qualms about making 10 year investment in information technology that would see it gain strategic advantage and decrease costs in the long term, the NHS would not, as it is does not have the capabilities, budget or inclination to do this. 

Every political party talks about the need for more nurses, doctors and front line staff and whilst this will improve the situation at present a better solution is to use technological advances to make the staff we have, positioned to do less (i.e focus on the human aspects such as care) with technology increasingly eliminating more of the work they currently do.

The majority of the UKIP supporters I have met don't know any UKIP policies except for immigration and leaving the EU and seem to believe the best way forward in Britain would be to kick out ""all these bloody immigrants"" (whilst of course, their definition of ""immigrant"" varies somewhat to not include foreigners they actually like). They don't give a shit about ""filling skills gaps"" or the ""Unskilled labour market"". They see the immigrants as the source of their problems and they don't want to differentiate between the Polish lass who's opened her own hairdresser and is paying her taxes and the Romanian who's living and working on a work camp in a fruit farm in lieu of more expensive machinery.
In my experience with talking to a UKIP supporter the average UKIPper doesn't actually know any other policy UKIP has other than ""kick out the immigrants"" and ""leave the EU"". They're not like the UKIP supports on reddit who've bothered to read the manifesto and have agreed to it. Seriously, every time I've asked a UKIP supporter in flesh space what their other policies are, they are left speechless, eventually admit they don't know, but then say they don't care because those two policies trump all and Farage is a fine upstanding man of the people (who's also an ex banker worth £49 Million). And UKIP don't care that a vast swathe of their supporters don't know their other policies and if you get the chance to ask Mr Farage (like I do), he quickly dodges the question. Which is wise considering that their manifesto include things like:

You're not wrong (though i would say that if you haven't found a **single** UKIP voter who is clued up then you haven't talked to enough people, or have just been unlucky) but the thing is this isn't something that is unique to UKIP by any means. Do you really believe your average Labour voter has a scoobie what the party stands for? No they vote for them because ""my faither voted Labour &amp; my faither's faither voted labour afore him"". Also the general perception that they 'help the poor' and such but i doubt a quarter of the population could name a single concrete policy.

I doubt many Green voters realise that their party wants to scrap the armed forces or abolish borders allowing complete unrestricted immigration into the UK (while also massively increasing the quality and accessibility of wellfare). They don't know this but instead vote Green on the basis of their core appeal - helping the environment (or as a protest vote).

I know a couple of rabid SNP supporters that would defend Salmond to the death because they believe in the core policy (Scottish independence) yet when i question them over their stances on individual issues (immigration, Europe, amongst others) they'd be far better suited to UKIP's side of the bench. They have no idea that the SNP is actually a centre-left party because their sources of information amounts to hearsay and the headline news that occasionally pops up during adverts on ITV. 

The simple truth is that the VAST majority of the public, even those that are politically opinionated -who in themselves are a minority- know little in the way of facts. People vote based either on tribal loyalties or whichever vague ideal appeals to them most. Those that go to the effort of reading manifestos, regularly checking political developments, getting info from multiple sources, etc are a small fraction of the voting public and that applies to all sides of the political spectrum.

&gt;Don't they already do that

Saying that I'm pretty sure they already log what IP address is used in what account

&gt;This will be hard to implement if they don't already have it .... giving a suggestion for what they could do.


Static IP addresses may make it easier to track what files people are using. So let's say User a uses IP 127.0.0.1 and user B uses IP 192.168.1.1 User C uses IP 192.168.1.2

These users switch up there IPs every 2 hours (Extreme but some people have automatic router restarts every couple of hours, don't ask why.)

now, Here comes a letter from the big CEO Of Songs.com He wants Users Bs details so he can send them a nasty letter. Thing is UserB switched emails with 3 different people that day and theres now a pile of log data to go through.

Now, If the ISP switches to Static IPs that user will be stuck with that One IP and it will be much easier for the ISP to pull up a record that says Oh look at this time he was downloading this file.

Could this be done on dynamic? Absolutely. But having everyone on static makes everyones jobs easier. I am not a fan of static due to for example if someone gets your IP. And starts ddosing you. You can't do anything and chances are your ISP won't happily change your IP. Many in europe currently plain out refuse to change IPs. Then you are stuck being ddos'd for days on end. No internet.

&gt;
She is a founding member of Matrix Chambers in London from which she continues to practise as a barrister. Matrix was formed in 2000 specialising in human rights law, though members also practise in a range of areas of UK public and private law, the Law of the European Union and European Convention on Human Rights, and public international law.[5]
&gt;
She is Chair of Omnia Strategy LLP, a law firm.
&gt;
She specialises in employment, discrimination, and public law and, in this capacity, has occasionally represented claimants taking cases against the UK Government.[6]
&gt;
Cherie Blair has appeared in a number of leading cases. A notable example before the European Court of Justice was concerned with discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.[7] In November 2007, she expressed interest in becoming a senior judge

When asked about overtime, I said I couldn't do any; I had fantastic feedback from my job, received excellent evaluations, so I let my line manage know that with that great feedback, it was reasonable that I did no overtime - there was no reason for me to do any, since I was doing very well in my contracted hours.

Never had any issue with this approach, since I could show that reasonable, for me, equated to nothing - a polite chat with the employer sorted this out.  Other people with less understanding managers at the place I worked at had it rougher, but with use of the union (and my situation!) I managed to get this free overtime crap removed for many people.

Of course, for those that wanted to (and were happy to do!) free overtime for the employer, they could quite happily do this - I just made it part of my recruitment campaign to let people know that they could get paid for it, or just not do it at all.

&gt;Feeling unsafe or under constant makes life miserable. We have been very lucky recently to have such peaceful times. I can't even imagine how shitty WW2 would be with German bombers in the sky, let alone before that. So I wouldn't say that we've managed hundreds of years. I think the world was a considerably shittier place back then and it's pretty damn good right now. But our standards are higher too, and people want to feel safe and be safe.

What I meant by that is Britain has never been a big fan of over reaching or invasive activities. 'A man's home is his castle' is a saying derived from English law and perfectly sums up how Brits feel about this kind of thing. Stepping away from that is a profoundly un-British act, and one which does (and righly should) draw suspicion. Anyone who invades that space has historically been met with a stubborn bloodymindedness to go away and leave alone.

&gt;There are economic consequences too, which has a wide impact on our quality of life. Some terrorist attacks could devastate the economy or undermine confidence in the country, which would fuck us all over for a long time. 

There are economic consequences to state over reach too. Hence the balance between a minimal amount of state involvement to guarantee the safety of the citizenry. The wonderful thing about terrorism is that the threat can be entirely imaginary and massively overstated. I personally feel more depressed, repressed and scared of what our government is doing 'in my name' than anything that religious fundamentalists have achieved in the past decade.

This is why things like secret courts are totally abhorrent to the rule of law, where justice cannot be seen to be done. To turn a phrase on it's head ""If they have nothing to fear, they have nothing to hide?"" and that's all I can think of when I hear that some government activity can't possibly be shared with the public. We are the electorate, they are *our* servants.

How so? China benefits from making its manufacturing and production sectors as attractive and cost effective as possible. That mean keeping its cost as low as possible. And even if China did introduce its own carbon tax, production would just shift again to somewhere cheaper, and less regulated. 

You don't solve anything by putting a tax on production, you just make it harder for UK companies to do business.

Oh, they have.  No need to imagine.   By 2030 they want all gas, coal, and nuclear powerstations closed.  They also want an additional 8% annually escalating duty on all fossil fuels until then as an 'incentive'.  Incentive in this case means fuel poverty hitting the most vulnerable first and making it more painful year on year.

In comparison China and the US have just brokered a deal which says that 2030 will be their emissions ceiling.  Their energy prices will be going down as the Greens would intentionally drive ours through the ceiling.  

The kicker being that they have less efficient stations and use dirtier coal in Asia, so the Green Party of England and Wales has worked out a perfect way to actually raise global emissions by sending our manufacturing where they have no intention of reducing emissions until 2030.

When he came to club he had all the potential in the world, but what separates good players from greats is their willingness to go the extra mile to be the best. An example would be that Lennon saw Bale come into the first team, become a regular and become one of the best in the world. Lennon also saw Bentley come with bags of talent but waste it. Lennon is in the middle of this spectrum IMO.

Is he a bad player? Not necessarily. Even when Lennon doesn't play well, his positioning draws the opposition's LB out. This creates pockets of space for strikers and other midfielders to exploit. When we have Lamela, Eriksen and Chadli playing our width comes from our fullbacks who normally get stopped by opposition wingers who track back. This means that the opposition back 4 is narrow and compact and very hard to beat. Throw in 2 DMs and that means we have to regularly beat 6 compact players who have no threat of a ball being played behind them to score a goal. 

But if we play Lennon, he should add an extra dimension to our attack! He also defends also, and is prepared to track back. I dont think he is good enough for a first team football in the top 4, but atm he is the only winger we have to offers width!

This is what the work that the Financial Stability Board, the European Commission and the Bank of England/PRA (from a UK perspective) have been undertaking over the past 6 years to end 'too big to fail', protect depositors, create new recovery and resolution powers, and create new 'bail-in' powers has been tasked to achieve. They have made a lot of progress and it can be said today that no failed UK bank would receive a bail-out. 


We have also seen the successful EU-mandated divestment of TSB from Lloyds and can expect the (delayed) Williams &amp; Glyn divestment from RBS down the road. Coupled with the rise of some new entries into the market like Virgin Money and we should see some increased competition in the coming years (with the newly commissioned competition enquiry into the SME market also carrying the potential to bring further divestments/market diversification).


The new policy environment has also seen a lot of the big banks reducing their 'casino' markets operations significantly as the 'regulatory burden' makes them less and less economical to carry. The potential downside to this is that these markets are being picked up by 'shadow banking' companies which have less oversight from regulators. There is also ICB ring-fencing of retail and investment operations to 'go live' in 2019, which will also probably see further reductions from the big banks. 


Unfortunately, a lot of this has been going on quietly without much fanfare and not too many people seem aware of the quite ambitious regulatory change that is ongoing within the UK banking industry. Come another crisis, the taxpayers won't be on the hook, the failed bank will be able to fail, the critical economic functions will be preserved using capital taken from private creditors, and depositors will be protected.

For me, personally, the sky is the limit. 

I'm anti censorship, pro compassion and pro inclusiveness (and that includes ""cocks"" or whatever labels you want to pin on people). My approach to dissenting voices or difficult people is to listen and understand why they are dissenting, or why they might be difficult to deal with. I can't imagine ever wanting to chuck anybody out of a discussion. I do enjoy my safe spaces too with my friends and family, but that's where they remain. I don't expect the rest of the world to cater to them. I don't tell people to fuck off if they say something I don't like.  I don't label people ""cocks"" because pejoratives are by definition inaccurate descriptors of people. 

Everyone has a right to create their own little hugbox, but a hugbox is by its definition exclusive. And that's fine. This protest is fine. We all need our voices heard from time to time. However, the greater the criteria for excluding people: opinions you don't like, being a cock, etc the further away you get from inclusiveness, as demonstrated by how quickly the OP told someone to fuck off.

I don't think using the machines are significantly more efficient in terms of time.

This is not really the case where in the industrial revolution a machine could literally do something ten times quicker than a worker. I feel like if the benefits are as marginal as they appear, it's not worth it because of the moral and societal element.

Besides, in the modern age people are so engrossed in their phones etc, the shopkeeper or bar staff are literally one of the only few random members of the public we still talk to. I think I'd go insane in London if I had to sit there silently any longer than I already do.

Agents need to maintain their margin, so pass cost on to the landlords whom pass cost on to Tenants.

I dont think they will itemize £100 refferenceing fee per tenant to landlord but cost +20% ish. They will increase their ""management fee"" from 8to10% of rent currently to a bit higher to cover their overheads and maintain their profit.

The bank failed because it was badly run, and also by going down the same paths as the ""glorified loan sharks"" that you feel the need to call every other bank - such as the PPI nightmare.

You can mention foreign versions if you like, but the co-op is a British example of what has happened when a bank has attempted to be run on a democratic and nominally ethical line.

&gt;But on closer examination, the welfare section includes pensions paid to nurses, doctors, police officers and fire crew. Many might think this is not really ""welfare"" spending.

&gt;Indeed the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests a nurse's pension might be better categorised under health spending - like that same nurse's salary.

&gt;But the Treasury argues that it is using categories that are recognised by the United Nations, and which conform to global standards.

&gt;The categories are based on Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (PESAs), which the Treasury has been using for years.

&gt;And yet in sending out the information to taxpayers, the Treasury did make one departure from normal practice.

&gt;Under PESAs, the state pension is normally included with welfare payments. But the Treasury decided to split out the state pension, and show it as a separate cost.

&gt;Its reasoning? The state pension represents 12% of all public expenditure, and therefore it says a separate category improves transparency for taxpayers.

&gt;But of course had it not split out the state pension, welfare would have appeared to represent an even larger proportion of public spending.

There are obviously many ways you can categorise expenditure. Personally I think it's a generally a good thing to inform people what the government is doing. Also, it pisses me off with people harping on the canard about the cost to post letters. The government posts a shit load of crap to people. It's a non-issue.

And how exactly would that work? It certainly isn't the model practiced by any country I'm aware of, they all have one entity owning and upgrading the infrastructure while leasing it to others. This could be a private company like BT or a state owned operation like the Australian NBN

Would you want one company bidding to hold a monopoly on a given area of the country? It does sound a bit like the rail franchise model, where there is little or no competition between operators and little or no infrastructure upgrades being done by the infrastructure owner for the large part of the country. While I can get a decent internet service here in this part of rural England, my rail line is Victorian and has no plan to be upgraded, even if it falls into the sea again

&gt; We are the America of Europe when it comes to the internet except we are a tiny country and nation wide fiber is so easily achievable by comparison.

That's the most unaccurate and funniest thing I've read today. I'm reasonably sure that countries with similar demographics (so no tiny city-states or urbanised Romania) have gone down similar routes to us. Germany, for example, uses just as much FTTC and VDSL as we do. If you believe that every other country in the world has 100% fibre to the premises and we're the only one who doesn't, you're mistaken

As for ""ease"", we are a small but densely populated country - it's not easy, and it isn't cheap, but would probably be doable if the government committed to it. £50bn is going to be spent on HS2, that would probably build a decent fibre to the premises network. The government would rather give a tiny fraction of this to BT and set it a pitiful 2Mbps target.

Most posts within the NHS are underpaid compared to what you would get working outside of the NHS. For example pharmacists, a community pharmacist can expect to start at £35k to 45k when registered, a registered hospital pharmacist starts at £25k band 6 AfC.

If you will be working away from home you will need to factor in the cost of somewhere to stay, this can be either hotel/b&amp;b or a rented flat (which one really depends on contract length and whether it is feasible to get home weekends).

If you are renting or sharing a flat then there will be bills, council tax and food costs in addition to the rent.

Entertaining yourself in a place far from friends and family adds to the cost here (try not to end up going to the pub every night just out of boredom).

Now if you discuss this sort of thing with other people (especially the aforementioned resentful staff) then you will generally hear at least one person say ""yeah but you can claim it back"" - This is only true to the extent that you are allowed to offset expenses against any tax due (and claim back VAT if you are VAT registered) you will still be paying the majority of these outgoings from your earnings.

Add to this - no sick pay, no holiday pay, sort out your own pension if you feel you need one etc etc.

Yes, we absolutely should be having talks about immigration. In fact we are almost every day in the Government and Media. Immigration and Racism are totally separate topics, and it's perfectly possible for to have a discussion on one without invoking the other. I find however that most of the time when people drop the ""We can't talk about immigration in public for fear of racism,"" it's in the same vein as ""I have black friends,"" i.e. an excuse to actually BE RACIST OR XENOPHOBIC while covering it up as just discussion.

Come back in 3 years for a verdict on Ilori, Origi, Markovic; they're not ready for the first team but show promise.

I'm unsure on Lallana  because he hasn't played enough, and only in matches where we've been shite. Probably a hit though.

I'm unsure on Allen because the only person who seems to have less idea of what Allen's role in the team is going to be long-term is Rogers himself. Defensive midfield? You can just go over him. Attacking midfielder supporting a lone striker? Not a goal threat. If there's a role in Rodgers' team for a player to orbit the centre circle keeping things ticking and controlling possession and tempo, Allen's your man. But we've only sporadically deployed a formation that puts him in that central playmaker role.

Most of these ""Misses"" are good players who are not suited for the way Rodgers wants to play, raising the question of who thought it would be a good idea to recruit them. 

Want a keeper-sweeper? Mignolet is the opposite of that.  
Prefer attacking fullbacks? Cissokho's a really decent defender.  
The team has finally settled on a style that is all about the movement of a pair of incredibly mobile strikers? Fielding one of Balo or Lambo will surprise your opponents!

It is clear that FSG and BR are building for the future. And in America, most of our summer signings couldn't go to the bar for a drink. So give the younger generation some time to gel and get comfortable with each other.

**Moreno** - Seems decent, just needs to work on defending.

**Aly Cissokho** - He done what was asked, can't argue with that.

Origi - Too young to say.

Balotelli - Doesn't seem to be working, but the entire team doesn't seem to work this season.

Lallana - Shown promise, but is he really worth his fee?

Borini - Would of been good if he went to Sunderland, but in terms of ability disappointing.

Aspas - Went to Barcelona 75m after sharing the Golden boot, done lots for us.

Assaidi - Waste of money, we could still make a profit though.

Sahin - Played him outside his favoured position, not blaming Sahin for my disappointment.

**Sturridge** - Fantastic, sad about injures though.

Moses - Disappointing, looked promising early last season (Swansea game his standout performance) but nothing more.

Manquillo - Seems like a good transfer so far, but I'd of liked to see someone established coming in RB but his fee makes him worthwhile, unlike paying big money for Southampton players who aren't totally proven yet.

Sahin - You put Sahin in twice

Markovic - 20m but not looking that good, too early to write him off though.

**Toure** - Apart from the high profile slip ups he has been decent for us, probably more comfortable with him than Skrtel/Lovren.

Allen - Does the job I guess, but I'd like to see his job if we had a real CDM. Nothing special though.

Sakho - Huge disappointment, maybe one of the biggest indicators about Rodgers poor defensive tactics. Really thought he'd be a standout defender in the league, not just for our team. 

Lovren - Disappointing, even though I wasn't fully comfortable with the transfer before due to Southampton being his only good career season.

Lambert - Maybe Brendan assumed he'd be rid of Borini, but even for 4m (it would be 80k/w if you want to pay a player 4m season). Lambert has been disappointing though I'd of preferred to save the money and go for someone of genuine class if possible.

Yesil - Injuries, young but doesn't seem promising.

&gt;Rev. __Sabine Baring-Gould__ (28 January 1834 – 2 January 1924) was an English [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican) priest, [hagiographer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagiographer), [antiquarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquarian), novelist and eclectic scholar. His bibliography consists of more than 1240 publications, though this list continues to grow. His family home, [Lew Trenchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Trenchard) Manor near [Okehampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okehampton), Devon, has been preserved as he had it rebuilt and is now a hotel. He is remembered particularly as a writer of [hymns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymn), the best-known being ""[Onward, Christian Soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onward,_Christian_Soldiers)"" and ""Now the Day Is Over"". He also translated the carol ""[Gabriel's Message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_Message)"" from the [Basque language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language) to the English.

1) The Weeping Angels are a terrifying bad guy.  You can't see them move. They kill you in an instant, in just the time it takes to blink.  You can't kill a stone and now everywhere I go, I get a little chill when I see stone or cement statues.  Imho, later episodes messed with the angels and made them more farcical than they were in Blink (especially The Angels Take Manhattan).

2) The way in which the angels kill and the explanation are fun and troubling at the same time.  ""They're creatures of the abstract."", ""They live on potential energy.""  The absurdity of the statement is immense, yet because the episode is setting our entire concept of time on its head, we accept it and then begin to try and understand it.

3) Time travel and paradoxes.  How does the Doctor know to leave the graffiti in the house so that Sally will find it?  Because Sally told him to.  But Sally only knew to tell him because she had seen it.  The entire episode is full of circular time, the DVD collection, the easter egg on the DVDs, the messages from Kathy.

4) The DVD easter egg is brilliant in the way it works not only for the reveal when Sally has the full conversation, but leading up to that, she sees parts and it fits in.  Also, that some things are so much more mundane than we think, i.e., ""Look to your left"".  Larry thinks it's a political reference, when it's only a literal direction to see what's to Sally's left.

5) The best definition of how time and time travel work in the Doctor Who universe.

Death cult carries quite clear implications - that death is the group's primary goal, and that this is inspired by some religious fetishization of death itself. But the IRA had clear political and social goals, and were using violence as a means, rather than an objective*, and are commemorating those they perceive as heroes of this campaign in a similar fashion to almost every society in the world. 

If you broaden out 'death cult' to include such organizations, then it becomes almost meaningless - any terrorist organization falls under the umbrella, as would revolutionary armies of most sorts, and a decent case could be made for standing armies used to achieve political ends too (as a true 'death cult' wouldn't need to distinguish between civilians and non-civilians?).

The younger players are not happy with the way the three most senior players have been behaving, training and playing.

MP bitterly disappointed with more than half a dozen of the squad who have decided the extra hard work they are being asked to do hasn't paid off, so they won't bother to do it. He wanted to give them time to buy into his plans, but they have chosen not to do so. Today's team selection is a reflection of this reality.

Adebayor and Lennon are refusing to accept a move. They've told MP that they don't care whether they play or not. They'll stay at home, train with the reserves or sit on the bench, as long as they collect their wages.

false,Colinfucius,lfc99,,"I actually wrote about this at length last window with a lot of specific examples, I'll try to find a link. The short answer is yes, there are a lot of parallels between FSG's spending patterns at Boston and Liverpool, notably the failed big money signings of Andy Carroll and Carl Crawford happening the same summer but there are many other examples.

There's really only two things I want to instill in Liverpool supporters. I wont take the time to argue out all of the specific examples and points, and I know it's a stretch to just take my word for it, but as a LONGTIME observer of FSG, here's what some people here are getting just flat-out wrong:

1. FSG are NOT a youth-only buyer. They are a heavy youth-buyer WHEN BUILDING A TEAM. Once that winning, consistent system is in place, then they will spend the right money at the right time to buy big players. Adrian Gonzales is a prime example. Lost out to the Yankees on Texiera and got an equally good player the next window for 2/3 the price because the damned Yanks had already overspend on the position. Outplayed. It's what FSG does in the long term but people don't take the long view ever, and they believe what they want to believe. I've seen these owners behave. They're smart, calculated, and they win. A lot. In sports that are supposed to be rigged against them. But no one wants to hear that because it's a fucking whinefest right now.

2. FSG will absolutely spend money, and they will ALWAYS spend enough money to be in the list of top 5 title contenders at the beginning of each season. I know people will refuse to hear me out on this because they have not yet seen the next stage of FSG club growth like Red Sox fans have been privy to. I've several times seen FSG make the biggest signing of the summer in the whole league, outspending the Yankees, Angels, Dodgers, etc. to get that perfect player. What Liverpool supporters may not believe me on is that FSG are CHOMPING AT THE BIT to get that perfect player at a big price (it failed with Carroll, but it's as if people forget that FSG even tried which frustrates me greatly), they just pick their spots over the course of 3-5 years. I don't expect anyone to believe me on that because they're consumed by the last two months and don't have an extra 10 years of observational data about FSG that have given me a perspective on the ownership and an understanding that not everyone can access.

BONUS: Since this keeps getting mentioned, FSG will never turn Liverpool into a feeder club. Their genuine hope is that these players hit their prime at OUR club and make Liverpool great. I know people won't believe me, but observing the behavior of ""fans"" over the past few months, I've almost reached the next level of not-giving-a-shit nirvana when it comes to ignorant people on this sub.

I'm honestly sick of fans whose view of the club consists of two months total, and it's whichever two months they feel like picking to bolster what they already irrationally believe about something. FSG have a 10 YEAR plan for Liverpool and always have. And guess what? It's fucking working. Those who were actually around know the state the club was in when FSG took over, but noooooo I wanna win now, where's my Suarez, wahhhhh wahhhhh wahhhhh.

Do you want to win a title? Do you REALLY? Then this is how you do it when you're not owned by an oil baron or one of Putin's corrupt fuckbuddies. Thank God the owners are keeping their blinders on and sticking with their guns, because if this club was run by supporters we'd have a new manager every 4 weeks and the club would COLLAPSE in debt. I'm not kidding.

Fucking nearsighted supporters can go drink a vat of piss. They know nothing about owning and building a team and make incorrect statements about people and systems they had no idea about until Gary Neville told them what to think. Fucking pissants can get off my fucking subreddit.

Edit: Just so we're clear I'm not claiming that FSG is perfect or immune from criticism, they have made plenty of mistakes and miscalculations with both of their properties.

false,kentrel,null,null,"Firstly, ""Define trolls"". ""Troll"" is a pejorative, and open to personal interpretation. Viewing people as trolls is a problem of labeling people, often incorrectly and ironically, *unjustly*. Google ""cognitive distortions"" for a greater understanding for why this is a thinking error. 

Secondly, any mention of rape culture is not shouted down online. There are plenty of tightly moderated places where people talk about it. Reddit alone has places devoted to that kind of thing. That doesn't mean every place should be as tightly moderated. 

Often the problem is people who come out of these tightly moderated spaces into more public spaces and are ill equipped to deal with dissenting opinions. Sometimes they are even shocked that there are dissenting opinions and they label these people as ""trolls"", ""cocks"", or whatever label feels fitting at the time. This is when arguments get emotional and irrational. It starts with the name calling, stereotyping and demonizing people who disagree.

Thirdly, I disagree with your statement that we can't seem to have a reasoned debate anywhere. You can have a reasoned debate anywhere you apply reason. It's not necessary for the other party to do so. You can only control your own argument. You have limited control over what they say. If they're talking crazy, you can remain rational. Eventually someone will follow your example. When you engage anyone in debate you are taking the risk that they might prove you wrong. Telling someone to ""fuck off"" when they disagree shows that maybe you're not all that willing to take on that risk.

And finally, equating someone threatening to punch you on the street with disagreement in online discussion is more than a bit silly. I don't consider an imminent in-person violent threat to be free speech. That's just silly. 

However, as it happens, I have had it happen. I've worked jobs where I was exposed to this occasionally. The most recent time I was able to talk him down and have a conversation with him. He was a very troubled mentally ill person, the kind of person that is most in need of compassion, but the least likely to receive it.

He trusted her with everything, time and time again, but his friendship wasn't enough for her. He was her friend and wanted to be her friend to get through his period of loss. But Martha didn't want friendship or companionship. The Doctor wasn't worth it to her if she couldn't have him romantically. It's a Friend Zone story in the opposite direction from usual. But for some reason we are sympathetic in this case. The Doctor didn't owe Martha his affection just because she wanted it. He offered her companionship and friendship and it wasn't enough, so she left. That's how unrequited feelings between friends often turn out. There wasn't anything wrong with it, and there wasn't anything wrong with how the Doctor handled it. He didn't owe her anything and I think Martha just finally realized that she wasn't going to wear him down to give in to her. 

And that's why Martha was boring. Her entire character was a story of unrequited love that for some reason the fandom has decided she was *owed*. Her story isn't really tragic. The Doctor didn't mistreat her. She didn't end up with less than she deserved. She was a bland companion who left on her own terms (and thus far is the only New Who companion to do so, pending The nature of Clara's departure in the Xmas special).

I can appreciate it must be frustrating to receive only vitriol instead of a reasonable discussion (though I would argue you get that on both sides - look at the comments section under any article criticising UKIP and PREPARE FOR HYBERBOLE!)

&gt;Out of everybody bashing UKIP and their supporters, only one person (that I saw) actually explained why they felt that way. Being critical is fine when you put something forward other than ""they are bad"" or ""they are racist"".

Have you considered that people don't explain their reasoning because they believe it's self-evident? When you view something as so patently, offensively out of step with modern views on nationality and race (and in the case of a few incidents, gender equality) I imagine you don't feel the need to explain *why* it's offensive. It's obvious why.

&gt;their plan is to implement a policy similar to Australia's

Did you consider that many people consider Australia's immigration policy to be racist, and [really quite cruel](http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/thebordercrossingobservatory/publications/australian-border-deaths-database/)?

&gt;nobody who moved to the UK using EU open border immigration will be deported.

UKIP's brand new star MP Mark Reckless suggested [that this was the case](http://www.itv.com/news/2014-11-19/controversy-after-ukips-reckless-comments-on-polish-plumbers/) not so long ago, advocating putting people who are living here legally under EU rules on fixed period permits that would end with them being sent back. You must see that UKIP has more than its fair share of people who would argue for [sending them all back](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520012/Send-home-In-shocking-video-UKIP-councillor-key-Farage-ally-launches-astonishing-racist-rant--tells-MoS-I-stand-word.html) too. Ayling is still a high ranking party member by the way, and Nigel has consistently [stood by her](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/08/ukip-victoria-ayling-immigration-nigel-farage). She is also a former member of the National Front. How does this look to people? How does this help repudiate the idea that UKIP advocates a jingoistic immigration policy?

Further to this, you have groups like Britain First [backing UKIP](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/29/britain-first-ukip_n_6066498.html). And while UKIP have strenuously denied that connection there must be *something* in their rhetoric and their policies that's attracting them. It's wilful ignorance to suggest there isn't.

It's easy to claim that people ""bashing"" UKIP are doing so in a kneejerk and unsupported fashion and, honestly, I'm sure some people are (there are always those people). However, it's another thing entirely to suggest that this kind of criticism is unfounded. UKIP make a lot of people profoundly uneasy because they have this ugly element in their ranks, and this edge to their policies that - while not openly racist - smacks of barely-concealed disdain and hatred of immigrants. I encourage you to take a step back and look at these issues from *our* side. If nothing else, understanding the view of people who oppose UKIP with arguments will help you counter them - claiming straw men is doing nothing to move the debate forward for anybody.

When I hit 17 my first thought was ""How can I get out on the roads?"" and I decided to take the bike route.

So I took them up on it and found myself to be far worse on a bike than I imagined I'd be. It took me at least 10 attempts to move away from stationary. After that, I couldn't find clutch control coming to me, and slow riding was very difficult. After this I done a few short cheap £10 ""pre-CBT"" sessions on the pad, these helped and I got the clutch control down. Went for my CBT and hammered it, I was the only one out of the 5 guys there to do it and get my certificate.

After that, I tried to do my A2 (33bhp one) and didn't mange it after about 3 attempts. So it put me off. Rewind about 5 months from now and I was desperate to get on a bike and get it done.

...granted ""by Home Office standards"" isn't saying much, but it's still a step in the right direction.  I guess we'll see what the actual text of the Bill says.

The problem is that Parliament won't.  Or at least, it will for about 3 days.  That is my major problem with this proposal.

Parliament is fucking *empty* at the moment, there's barely any legislation going through it because the Coalition is falling apart at the seams and the Government can't think of anything to put in this pointless year the Fixed-term Parliaments Act has imposed on everyone.

I don't see, therefore, when there's ample Parliamentary time open, why the Home Secretary can't put these proposals before Parliament in the usual manner, timetabled in a sensible fashion, and give it the full scrutiny that any additional surveillance powers deserve.

The Home Office's increasing tendency to ""fast-track"" legislation is very worrying.  I would suggest that, unless the intelligence services can provide evidence to the Intelligence and Security Committee that such legislation is needed *right now*, their legislation should be subjected to the same detailed scrutiny that all other laws get.  After all, such scrutiny is perhaps even *more* warranted in their case.

-edit- I have sometimes wondered, given the increasing use of ""fast-track"" legislation, what would happen if a Government tried to pass what's known as a ""Henry VIII clause"" - a clause that allows the Government to amend laws by statutory instruments, effectively without Parliamentary oversight - in such a speedy fashion. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that such a clause could be buried in a Bill and not found during the ""fast-track"" process.

A bit flukey (i mean it is one of my best memories watching ANY sport, but still) FSG has done a tremendous job of rebuilding after 04. They let go one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history (pedro martinez in 99 and 00 were among the top 5 dominant seasons ever in mlb history), because he was injury prone and was getting older. They let some of their vets go but refilled with a good young core with some veteran presence. They rarely overpaid and rarely made panic moves. That patience paid off in 07 as they won the series and almost won again the next season. Until 2011 they were pere nial contenders, then collapsed at the end of 11. Then in 12 they dumpednoff most of the high salary vets for a bunch of youngsters (they freed $260m of commitments in one trade. Ridiculous) AND THEY WON AGAIN in 13. Sure they had an off year in 14 but baseball is prone to fluctuations. FSG paid a lot this off season sure, but the sox are  cash cows, and i dont think this affects how liverpool would be run. Honestly i think the current predicament just comes from the nature of the transfer market in football. When players want to leave you really cant so much but to let them go, while in the US if your contract isn't over youre shit out of luck. Losing a world class player like suarez will hurtnthe team in the short run. I think it isnwise until the end of the season to make a judgment though- i think rodgers can pull a turnaround like the 2nd half of 12-13. One lesson to be learned by FSG and the Sox is though that you gotta let go of old declining superstars without remorse. I feel like Gerrard at CDM is reaching that point. The man can pass but god damn he is too slow now and should not be played full 90 min.

The other likes everything else Soldado brings to the table, such as more creative passing and runs that make the attack as a whole look more dangerous.  They also tend to believe he can return to his clinical form, or at the very least that it doesn't matter if he does as long as he is contributing to a potent attack.

The Vale (at least where I live) has been constantly steamrolling its way through projects where local people don't want them, and things that local people want are completely overlooked by the council.

Examples:

* Tarmacking a local village green so cyclists can use it, despite there being 2 nearby roads that aren't particularly busy - the reason given was later changed to helping disabled people get around town

* £250,000 spent building a zigzag cycle path up a hill, to avoid cycling up a hill only 200m down the road. Far more people cycle up the hill as it's not so far out of the way. They're about to spend a further £100,000 installing lighting

* A church that the council was supposed to be maintaining fell into a state of disrepair where a local boxing club operated. Despite the local public wanting to remain residence in the church the council is saying they must pay for the repairs (they can't afford) or be evicted

* A local nursery school, which was praised in an inspection report for the size of its significant playing grounds, is about to annex a large patch of grass next to it that's used by local dog walkers. 2/3rds will be fenced off and the remaining third tarmacked for parking

* Despite local residents concerns, the council is building a skatepark near a young children's park. So far they've not held any consultation on the matter

Actually, they only had a consultation on one of these issues, which was changed to a display after negative feedback. An open town meeting was forced, in which a huge majority (I can't remember the figure off the top of my head) called for a local referendum on the tarmacking, however as they were a small amount (I think 10-20) off the minimum 150 votes required, the council refused to hold a referendum.

If the council is volunteering to merge with Bridgend, they won't need to hold an election until 2018, by which point they'll have been in power of 6 years, so we can't even vote them out in the near future. If they're volunteering to merge with Bridgend, it also means that they believe the new council will be more like how they are now than if we merged with Cardiff.

Council tax is also much higher here than in Cardiff despite Cardiff being the council.

I don't think Londoners tend to identify with the region as a whole. 

If I'm asked where I'm from (in London), I'd probably tell them my town. I say ""town""... it feels more like an arbitrarily delineated local council area in a homogenous concrete blob. Sometimes the only way to tell you've left one town is that the postcode on the signs change.

I worked there for 2 years, but have only ever studied outside of London. I could never imagine commuting to university. Commuting to work was bad enough, at least I got paid for that.

For me, my only pull to London is my family. It's not about the skyscrapers/tourist traps; it's the place where I grew up, where my parents live, where I walk the dog, went to school etc.. 

The thing with London is that it is lots of towns in one continuous area. Such a big city with so many people. Some of it is awful, some of it is great. Some parts may be an acquired taste. Everybody is different.

Parts of Leeds are stunning, parts are horrific. It's like anywhere.

Rodgers seems pretty  poor in cup games too. I can't remember a good performance in one under him. Whereas Rafa again, was great at getting wins in cups.

It seems like the two are complete opposites in terms of managing. Under Rodgers we played attacking football which used to be able to roll over teams that couldn't handle our quality going forward, but comes undone by organized defending. Under Rafa we played conservative football, and Rafa played his opponent rather than sticking to a style, but often played too conservative to break down lesser teams.

Barristers can make a fortune out of legal aid.

Even the average one is doing a lot better than most people

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10553212/Barristers-strike-1m-wasted-in-court-after-legal-aid-protests.html

&gt; The department highlighted figures showing that 1,200 barristers judged to be working full-time on taxpayer-funded criminal work received £100,000 each in fee income last year. Six barristers picked up more than £500,000 each, it said.

So if you're a top human rights lawyer you're not going to go bust suing companies to make them pay more cash. The companies might go bust defending themselves though. 

Like I say this stuff is the reason companies don't employ people in the UK.

Incidentally doesn't it strike you as being a bit odd that barristers don't face competition from foreigners - they've set things up so that the demand for lawyers far outstrips supply and their rates go through the roof. Meanwhile their version of human rights means that ordinary working class people *do* have to compete with foreigners. Which means their rates go through the floor. So Cherie makes a ton of cash from her job but can pay her cleaner/nanny under the minimum wage because that cleaner/nanny has to compete with loads of applicants for the same job?

&gt; Are you referring to events in the 18th century to justify mass shootings and the bombing of pubs, restaurants and hotels in the 20th century?

Whilst not a direct justification it points to a direct lineage of oppression and colonialism that stretches back into history, are we only to cherry pick from historical incidents with which you are comfortable. 

&gt; You can't see problems with that kind of logic?

Whilst seandalai is making a scattered and incoherent point, there is indeed logic there, All of these historical events brought us to where we are today, they cannot be ignored nor brushed aside. They are deeply interconnected events that inform our history.

&gt; (And as it happens, the same people who led the PIRA violence in the 1960s - the likes of Gerry Adams etc - were simultaneously being provided with housing, healthcare, welfare payments, free education and other comforts by the UK taxpayer on a much greater scale than even we see in the present day) 

This is truly bizarre little aside, You are in sense correct, the catholic population owe a lot to the Modern welfare state (more on that later), brought into existence by the efforts of the English Working Class, but whilst we are on the subject of the welfare state, it was opposed vehemently by the Unionist one party state and Unionism in general. The Northern Ireland statelet viewed its population of catholics as untermenschen from the outset. In its first year widespread violence saw the deaths of many.

&gt; Northern Ireland came into being in a violent manner – a total of 557 people were killed in political or sectarian violence from 1920 to 1922... mostly Catholics
[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles#1912.E2.80.931922)

It was common practice to discriminate against Catholics in jobs, housing and elsewhere; to the point of absurdity.

&gt; Protestants were a majority, but not a confident one. A sense that their ascendancy was fragile and persistently under threat led to a paranoia about Catholics, showing itself in outrageous anti-Catholic violence, unrestrained rhetoric and blatant discrimination, which gave only the illusion of strength. In this respect it was still important to maintain the dimensions of difference between Protestant and Catholic, ensuring that religion coincided with patterns of differentiation in education, housing, the economy and politics. Advertisements for jobs in the Belfast Telegraph stated religious preference, and most requested Protestants. In 1926, for example, it was common to see advertisements like the following: 'wanted, strong country girl for housework, must be able to milk; Protestant preferred'; 'respectable Protestant little girl wanted to mind young baby': **it is not apocryphal that someone once advertised Protestant puppies for sale.** ^[source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/sectarian/brewer.htm)


Sectarianism was a deeply ingrained in every aspect of life, before the introduction of the welfare state catholics had to endure the mindless bigotry of their *betters*

&gt; 'The Catholic poor were all too willing to beg instead of work but showed no poverty under the blankets', as a Chair of the Board once said. Some Protestant clergy criticised poor Catholics who were a 'wastrel class' and asked the Board to cut grants 'to parasites' (see Bardon, 1992: 525). Goldring (1991: 48) argues that the Board were Calvinists who believed that **poverty was a judgement from God** and that after partition the Board saw themselves as in the front line of a war to maintain a Protestant majority. They were thus intent on preventing Catholics from getting relief. **Protestants were unemployed because they confronted unfortunate circumstances, Catholics because they wasted money on gambling and drink, and made no effort to find work** (ibid.). Objections to other 'habits' led some government ministers to try to restrict British welfare dispensations, with one proposing to abolish family allowance payments for the fourth and any subsequent children. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church supported the views of Professor Corkey, a Presbyterian theology teacher and a former Minister of Education in the Northern Ireland government, who said that parents of large families ought to be fined for having so many children (see Rafferty, 1994: 247). ^[source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/sectarian/brewer.htm)

Growing changes in Britain saw the introduction of the welfare state, which was opposed in unionist circles, they however had no choice in the matter because Northern Ireland had become redundant economically (As a state it has only been Economically viable for around 8 or 9 years of its existence, it has since then; never been a net contributor to the UK economy)

&gt;  Despite the instinctive reaction within the party that it was an alien and ‘socialistic’ importation. In the post-war period the Prime Minister, Lord Brookeborough, chose to pursue a path of increasing financial dependence on the Treasury to stave off loss of support because of the province’s economic difficulties and high level of unemployment.
&gt;loyalists were concerned that the welfare state and new factories in areas like Londonderry would upset the demographic balance and undermine Unionist control of border counties like Fermanagh and Tyrone where Catholics were a majority of the population.
&gt; The Prime Minister was also aware that the new international situation with the creation of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights left the regime open to new forms of criticism from its nationalist and labour opponents. 
&gt; ^[Source](http://www.sneps.net/OO/images/1-mup%20chapter.pdf) 

Whilst the standard of living improved slightly for catholics thanks to the Welfare state, strict control of housing allocation by the state created a chronic housing shortage. Allocation was controlled in order to control and gerrymander electoral districts to ensure Unionist dominance. It was these conditions that led to the formation of the [NICRA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Rights_Association).

The Civil Rights movement came into being after an utterly failed border campaign initiated by the IRA. A curious thing had begun to take place among northern catholics, the welfare state had created an environment in which catholics where [no longer concerned](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=868iOmM2z5MC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Welfare+state+opposed+in+Northern+Ireland+1940s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yZNzVKHrJcTKaJj2gYgI&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Welfare%20state%20opposed%20in%20Northern%20Ireland%201940s&amp;f=false) about a United Ireland, but improving material conditions within Northern Ireland. The IRA recognised this and abandoned their armed campaign. They began to completely refocus their organisation away from Violence towards peaceable social change.

The NICRA was a broad movement that had Moderate Unionists, Anarchists, Socialists and Republicans, it held the hopes of many for a better and more just society. It was a the reaction of the state who sought to smash the movement. It brutalised and slaughtered a peaceful movement over very reasonable demands. The actions of the IRA Leadership are clear, they had tried a futile armed campaign previously, it had no support and they wound it up. Their actions subsequently were to campaign in a peaceable manner in a broadbased coalition for positive change. They had not forseen the disproportionate response that the state would mete out, the Republican movement split over how to deal with the actions of the state. At the time Catholic areas were daubed with the slogan ["" I R A= I RAN AWAY""](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oVaUkHKOyLAC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=%22I+R+A%3D+I+RAN+AWAY%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L43qTZUV3f&amp;sig=sA0E69mRJSe9H169N1GTDoIZXAI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bJA2VPOoOMGa7gar84HoBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20R%20A%3D%20I%20RAN%20AWAY%22&amp;f=false), they where sneered at for their inaction. It was the demand from the Civil Rights generation that brought the PIRA to fruition, the Catholic population would no longer traipse home from a march beaten bruised and dejected while their friends and comrades lay in pools of blood in the street. The IRA strategy was to mobilize people around social issues, but steered clear of directly controlling organisations it had helped create. The Level of violence unleashed shocked even the IRA who were ill prepared for such an eventuality, [in fact it split over what to do in response.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Irish_Republican_Army#August_1969_riots)

&gt; The republicans were active in influencing the direction taken by NICRA as well as in its creation. Goulding himself was present at the Wolfe Tone Societies meeting in Maghera in 1966. To understand the significance of their involvement, however, and the direction in which republican influence took the civil rights movement, it is necessary to examine carefully the political strategy of the republicans in the mid-1960s. The abandonment of the 1956-62 IRA military campaign was highly ambiguous and from outward appearances it was possible to interpret republican actions as either preparation for a renewed onslaught or as a delicate operation to keep the movement together while its direction was fundamentally changed.

false,bwl17,TrinityHall,Trinity Hall,"I had my interview two years ago, I'm currently in my second year at Trinity Hall, I can give you advice based on what my two interviews were like, but different colleges might run it differently. 

I was only asked one question about my personal statement, and that related to something I wrote about one of the books I had read. I started talking without thinking of what to say, but I realised while I was talking that I wasn't actually saying anything meaningful, so I stopped, thought for a second, and then gave a one sentence answer which was far better than anything I had said before. 

The rest of the first interview was them asking questions about various scenarios involving whether the emergency services should be liable for their mistakes/being late etc. I think the most important thing if you get those questions is to say what you think is right instinctively, but be prepared to defend it, and be ready to say why people might take a different view, but why yours should still be preferred. 

Before the second interview I had 15 minutes to read and make notes on a statute, then I was asked questions about what the provisions would mean, what the rationale behind it might be, and whether there were any criticisms which could be made. Don't be afraid to say 'I don't know' or 'I can't think of any', that looks much better than hesitating for ages or saying something stupid. They'll probably then point you in the right direction, so just expand on what they've suggested, or if you disagree, then say that too. 

I don't have any other past papers for the Cambridge Law Test, but I can give a few pointers on the problem question section, which is the one I got. Firstly, you definitely won't have time to write down everything you want to, so focus on the stuff you think is most important, and be as succinct as possible. You'll probably get a statute, and then a series of questions relating to it. Start by reading it through, paying particular attention to whether lists are 'and', 'or' or 'but', it is really important that you get it right. When you're working through the problems, work through the statute in order if you can, if it's easy to discount something quickly then do so, only focus on the facts which might be contentious, and make sure you come to a conclusion on all the points, something like 'It would probably be found that...' is a good way to start.

Llori - haven't seen him play much. which means he has 0 impact on the team, which means miss.


Luis Alberto - miss. again 0 impact. I don't even remember him playing for more then 30min.


Coutinho - hit


Moreno - tries to go forward and create something, but forgets to get back and defend leaving tons of free space. I can't say he is something spectacular, just decent. miss


Aly Cissokho - He had few good games, but still his passing and mistakes needs a lot of work.


Origi - he's not even in the club, which means he has 0 impact to change something right now, so therefore miss. I'll try to explain my logic, because I think I'll get some hate about this. I rate a player ""miss"", if he doesn't contribute to the team or even worse, he plays bad. Origi isn't playing for us right now, which means he is practically useless for us. I'm not saying he is a bad player, hell, even if he becomes the goalscorer of the French league what do we get from this right now? Nothing. Miss.


Balotelli - Definitely a huge miss. I was hoping for the price we got him to end up a nice surprise, unfortunately this boy just doesn't have it in him. His goals are evidence for this. 

 
Lallana - one of the few that I can say tries to play, but with few results. Runs with the ball in the penalty area and loses it. Best thing - corner kick. For the price we payed....miss.


Borini - miss. Again. His goals. His playtime.


Aspas - miss. Also didn't even had a full match.


Assaidi - I can't even remember how he looked?!


Sahin - It felt like we had his family as hostages and made him play for us. Never felt like enjoying to put on the red shirt. Also, did almost nothing. Miss.


Sturridge - kind of hit, but still. These injuries, if we get half a season with him would be nice.


Moses - miss. Same as Sahin. Just came for the paycheck.


Manquillo - same as Moreno. Goes way too upfront and can't get back on time. Gets pass by too often. So far a miss.


Can - He has one good halftime agains Chelsea, other than that. Can't remember he did much. Miss.


Markovic - the ""talent"". Doesn't get chance to play, when he does doesn't impress with something. So far miss


Toure - hit. For an emergency bench player.


Allen - 90% of the time invisible, 10% great passes sideways and to the defenders. Miss


Sakho - Shows a few decent games, gets dropped from the team. If he is going to be our substitute defender, ok. Hit

 
Lovren - I can't even


Lambert - The ""boy dream"". Touching story for a movie, but for an attacker...not so much. Even for a substitute, I haven't seen him change anything. Miss

Sponeck and Halliday wrote an article in The Guardian explaining their position, accusing the sanctions regime of violating the Geneva Conventions and other international laws and causing the death of thousands of Iraqis.""

12. Decides to convene immediately **upon receipt of a report in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 11 above**, in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security;

If there is any damage that the landlord can argue was on balance almost certainly you e.g. the room has ""nosemaster woz ere"" scribbled on the wall, then a judge may decide to award something.

For starters, it's a write up of a situation based on an interview with Tony Griffiths that I set up and a colleague of mine conducted. It was originally planned for use in both Blue Moon Live and the BlueMoon Podcast, but I decided to write it up as a blog for Typical City as well, given I had the material and the raw audio. 

I didn't criticise Manchester City for not investing in the Sierra Leone OSC and the ebola relief effort because I (or Sam) didn't interview anybody from the club on the topic. Whether or not the club invests is their prerogative; they have charities that they work with, like all clubs, and they'll donate what they see fit and where they see fit to do it. I agree, they could help, assuming they're not already - but in an article, interview and report about how the country is coping and the efforts of a group of fans, I didn't focus on the club at all. Sam spoke to a fan and I wrote up what he said. That was completely unintentional because editorially it's not an angle that crossed my mind with the materials at hand.

As for the insinuation that this was a self-promotional piece, I'm not really sure what you mean. Surely EVERY written piece or radio piece I do builds up a career, so everything I do could have that said of it - from writing serious stuff about dealing with ebola to writing silly stuff about managers' hats. And in both situations I try to write it as best I can; sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.

I'd like to point out that I didn't link my Twitter account at the end of the article, I'm told that they're added automatically based on the author of the post. I did, however, link to the Podcast - where the report told people how to donate, incidentally. It was also explained how to donate on the live radio show on Sunday evening. I agree - and apologise for not doing so - that the link to the Sierra Leone OSC should have been there, but I think it's unfair to suggest I wrote this purely to curry favour for my own career - especially as it was third in the pecking order of work that I did on this topic, behind the audio work, and written for a blog that I'm not paid to write for.

I'm no champion of MCFC Sierra Leone, but equally I'm hardly hiding the ways to donate to the cause - that was a pure oversight.

The looks I get when I mention this, if you could see how some people react.

The reality is that for generations of families, council housing was good quality, cheap and readily available. They feel (rightly or wrongly) at 18 you can just move out and just get a council house (for the rest of your life) and never lose it, even if you don't pay your rent. I still meet people who think if they don't pay rent that the council will just rehouse them.

However people feel, it's highly likely (and I know some already experimenting with this) going into the future that council tenancies will only be for set periods and then reviewed. Most authorities are stuck on getting their tenants to have any kind of exit strategy at the end of any set term, for now.

He does that really well, but what I'm saying is that sinsce signing him we don't seem to have been using a formation that calls for a player in that playmaker role.

There are two things that Allen can't do well: his physical stature means he isn't good at protecting the back four, and his inability to hit a cow's arse with a banjo means that his well-timed runs into the box to get on a target man's knockdown or a winger's pull-back are wasted. He makes those runs well, but he can't shoot when he gets there.

But it seems that these are the two things being asked of him at Liverpool. By playing on the transition as we did last season, there isn't a requiement for that kind of tempo-setting role. Allen would be rated really highly at a team that played Barcelona / Swansea style *tiki taka*. If we played the kind of possession and control football we were all expecting when Rodgers took over, Allen would be in his element. But we don't, so as good a player as he is, it's hard to say signing for Liverpool was a great move for either player or club.

Well what can you say, lots of people had a bad feeling before the game, all the stats were in our favour, and most people expected us to win... Of course it'd go wrong!  

I can't really see much beyond Forster's atrocious decision to come out for that ball only to miss it. I didn't get to watch most of the game but that was their only shot on target. We restricted a team at home to only 1 shot on target again, it just happened to be into an open net. We then piled on the pressure and eventually got our hard-fought equaliser, but once again we managed to totally over run a team at home, and force them to defend en masse to try to stop us.  

We can't win every game, and I am more than happy to still be in second after a draw. Never did I think I'd be in a position as a Saints fan, at any point in a season, to think ""it doesn't matter what happens this weekend, we'll still be second.""  

Plenty on /r/soccer just think we're being dicks by actually enjoying it, because how dare we enjoy a spell when our team are doing so well. We're all ungracious in --defeat-- a draw that we undoubtedly deserved, if not the win really.

&gt;Climate change is set to inflict “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” on people and the natural world unless carbon emissions are cut sharply and rapidly, according to the most important assessment of global warming yet published.

&gt;The stark report states that climate change has already increased the risk of severe heatwaves and other extreme weather and warns of worse to come, including food shortages and violent conflicts. But it also found that ways to avoid dangerous global warming are both available and affordable.

&gt;“Science has spoken. There is no ambiguity in the message,” said the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, attending what he described as the “historic” report launch. “Leaders must act. Time is not on our side.” He said that quick, decisive action would build a better and sustainable future, while inaction would be costly.

Nick Davies ( He broke the phone hacking scandal at Murdochs, News International ) wrote a book in 1998 called Dark Heart (Have a look, a short preview is on google books) . During the 80's half of the working girls in London brothels were from Nottingham. a different ethnic group were involved (Pre the East European/Russian wave of working girls) All the girls at that time were 18. If they were younger Vice Squad would persecute ruthlessly those involved. The same tactics were used, charm, coercion, and class A drugs and finally threats. Before they knew it they were in working flats in the West End.

I was working for the flats at that time as a card man ( placing card ads in phone boxes ). I knew some of the people in the book personally. When the book came out there was real anger on the scene. He had real inside information on a business that had never been really exposed before. Turns out it was one of the inside people who gave him the information, they had become a crackhead with no where else to turn, so the beans were spilled.

I guarantee that when most of the girls turn eighteen they will be either in flats or on websites. It generates fortunes for ruthless people, truly fortunes. Cops need to spend whatever it takes.

You are right on the account of him being a poor shooter in this case, and that our formation, either the current iteration of 4-3-3 with Gerrard and Henderson, or the weird hybrid diamond of Gerrard behind Coutinho Allen and Lallana do not play to his strengths. If anything, Gerrard is the problem here, and more like as not, Allen will outstay Stevie in our midfield. 

I think having Allen is definitely a boon. It gives us the option to revert to a possession and pace-control style of play without losing the speed and power of players like Henderson, Sterling, and Sturridge. I've always thought that he was a great ""Plan B"" option when he was purchased initially, brought on as an intelligent and more possession minded alternative to Lucas. Of course that was before Lucas blew his knees out and Gerrard was rediscovered as the new landlord of that patch of midfield.

I honestly hope you're right, that he is a diamond in the rough.

A desperately poor turnout in the crowd too, but I'm not surprised seeing the desperate football we're playing at the moment. In the week when we celebrate 140 years since being formed and being pioneers of football, we continue to play like a lower division side happy to try and keep the score down.

        ""We recognise the value of the original goal of the 
         founders of the European Communities.""

        ""We believe that the ecological challenges and stark 
         inequalities the world faces present a potential new 
         role for the EU as part of wider global co-operation.""    

Up until recently Daniel Cohn-Bendit was co-president in Europe of their Green bloc.  Cohn-Bendit (among other unsavoury things of the upmost nature) is co-chair of the pro-Federalist Spinelli group.

At the same time they do say, 
 
        ""EU110 To achieve the Green vision, Europe will need 
         very different structures from those currently in 
         existence. Europe should be made up of overlapping, 
         co-operative, democratic, decentralised groupings of 
         nations and regions.

         EU111 European institutions must be designed with 
         care and with mechanisms for correction, to prevent 
         the drift towards centralism that has repeatedly been 
         seen in history.

         EU112 Part of the way to do this is to have a 
         multiplicity of independent bodies with clearly defined 
         areas of responsibility, and with the possibility of 
         membership by different groups of nations and regions. 
         An example is the Organisation for Security and 
         Co-operation in Europe for conflict resolution. 
 
         EU113 Europe must not become a super-state or 
         global power bloc.""

So on one hand they support ever closer union and the vision of the founding fathers, on the other hand they then advocate some pretty strong reforms and that Europe should not become a super-state, but on a *third* hand they sit with Federalists.

They're a little schizoid about it, and they're certainly very pro-heavy reform, but they're not anti-EU and they don't advocate leaving it.   They have a vision for Europe and the EU has a role in it.

They're by no means anti-EU.   

         ""I support a referendum on our membership of 
          the EU because I am pro-democracy, not because 
          I'm anti-EU - and because I want to see a radical 
          reform of the way Europe operates.

          The EU has the potential to spread peace and  
          make our economies more sustainable, and to promote
          democracy and human rights, at home and throughout 
          the world.""

Got to laugh at the Green MP saying they could make economies more sustainable through the EU.  Between the two they're fire &amp; brimstone.

There's flatly zero reasons to be treating our poorest in these ways, if we'd spent half of the money wasted on welfare reforms just paying it out in welfare, we'd likely be better off, the way IDS has been throwing money into any black hole of pointlessness he can find, combined with hiring just about any private company, so long as they're utterly incompetent, and willing to judge the poor and judge them guilty of ..something, in order to stop any support.

Mental gymnastics to justify carrying out horrific acts against one's fellow man, thankfully, remains a minority pursuit in Ireland, reserved mostly for that small segment of any population in all societies who relish the opportunity to conduct brutality, under whatever cloak of convenience.

As Anders Breivik, Timothy McVeigh, Gerry Adams, the Baider Meinhof gang and Red Brigades show - its always possible to talk one's self into some half-concocted rationale for why a series of acts of violence are ""necessary"" for the pursuit of an individual's favoured political goal - though a glance at the ghoulish items on offer in the Sinn Fein gift shop hardly suggests the campaign of shooting and bombing was conducted with a heavy heart by Irish Republicanism. Indeed their nostalgia for the Troubles is palpable by the rushing desire to rename parks and dedicate murals to invented ""heroes"" they have fantasised about that time.

Its a great mercy for us all though, that most of civil society sees through this Symbionese Liberation Army style self-justifying nonsense.

I don't deny the situation in Northern Ireland was no rose garden in the 1960s by the way, or that Paisleyites and loyalists were guilty of the crudest and most backward sectarianism. I get the feeling you think I might - I don't. That would be a false premise for discussion.

false,lawlore,null,null,"My degree, a 2.1, has at no point played a role in getting me a job afterwards- I was unemployed for six months, and found the fields I'd looked to get into to be extremely competitive, particularly graduate roles. This competition was not just from people with relevant experience such as myself, but also from subjects only tangentially related to the positions. Eventually, I settled into a position I could have got without the degree.

However, my degree was a four-year combined degree with one subject that would traditionally be considered a good, strong subject (a language), and one that would probably be considered wishy-washy (a humanities subject). The things I learned at University, particularly things I learnt in my studies, have been useful in ways I can't quite explain. They have, at various points, come in useful for the various jobs I have done since then- I haven't used the degree, but I have used what I learned. The experience was incredible, and I wouldn't change the time I spent there for the world.

There are key careers that will, of course, require a strong degree. If what you want to do is something which requires a lot of specific knowledge, of course, a degree is essential. Ask yourself if the career you want at the end of it needs you to have a degree, or whether you're going to gain more from having a three or four year headstart of experience and contacts in the industry.

Look at the remarkable similarity on paper and the disparate results of the two managers IRL. A board of conviction won't fire a manager over results because X number of points can equal CL glory for one or financial stability for another or fans who can be happy with top 8. 

Rafa had shitty owners and evident managerial ability as well as the obvious CL. His end here was one of tragic farce. 

Rodgers CV isn't on the same scale.  he lost his best player and all we see are brief flashes of last season **but** what BR did last season was adjust the side. Make it so damn top heavy that it could function despite shipping twelve goals a game. Not hard with the talent you say and fairly so but remember that we tried to score 10 goals once...mental...brilliant...it wasn't just shoehorning talent it was coaching and coaxing them into a system where the front line expected to score 5 a game. 

Does he adjust now again and in a way more clever manner or does this apparent complacent and static approach cost us? 

It won't be points that get BR fired...or not points alone. FSG are to shrewd to risk the financials the pr and the new rebuilding cycle if there is an indication he can right the ship. 

Don't be surprised if a striker doesn't come. This season will be defined by Rodgers handling of Gerrard cos this team can score goals if he's not always in the side.

Apologies.

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;If we can get renewables working effectively then that's it: energy forever.

Exactly. And it is of course energy that basically dictates prices for a lot of things. Large amounts of genuinely renewable cheap energy independent of other countries would make it cheaper to do basically everything including manufacture goods, transport those goods and operate those goods. Fuel costs both for individuals and companies would become irrelevant. It's a very long way off but perfectly possible given earth's potential capacity for renewable energy sources. 

And from a UK perspective if we could generate enough to export we could generate shit tonnes of tax revenue from the trade. We have some of the largest tidal ranges in the world meaning we could (unlike most countries) theoretically generate a huge amount of energy from tides and corner the market in developing the technology. We have plenty of wind and plenty of rivers to dam and as solar panels become trivially cheap it will become standard to have one on your house and office. Sweden incinerates 99% of it's rubbish and generates energy from it even being paid by Norway to burn their rubbish - that can produce lots of CO2 but when you're burning biomass like paper it carbon neutral and as carbon capture become further developed it could be done with negligible CO2 released. 

Long story short, if we can get sufficient diversity of renewable sources not only will we be dependent on no-one for our energy future but energy and fuel prices will no longer depend on the price of one commodity (in our current case, oil) meaning prices would stop rising and falling and become very predictable.

Up there the wind is more consistent and quick. Electricity can be generated at these heights for 60% or so of a year. Due to the nature of the wind (speed), turbines are smaller but can operate at significantly higher speeds. In any speed of wind they will face barring an actual hurricane. Which also means they are less visible. Very importantly too is the fact that they use significantly less materials than current wind turbines. Around 80-90% less materials.

I know before that it was considered that Van Gaal could've come along. His experience would've been invaluable in this situation. If Rodgers felt uncomfortable working with him, then he should've been told he wouldn't have got the job.

When Rodgers walks into Melwood tomorrow, there is not a single person who has got more experience than he has. And Rodgers himself has very little. When times are hard, Rodgers doesn't have anyone to ask for help. He's got to figure it out on his own. 2 minds are better than one, he should have a senior figure at the club giving him guidance.

I read before that Mike Marsh, one of the coaches, is being developed and that Rodgers said that he is still learning his trade. I'm not sure that is entirely appropriate. I agreed with Muelensteen. He needed an experienced coach to help him run the training session. Now, we have Rodgers complaining of lack of preparation time due to European commitmnets.

false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"&gt; Rafa was amazing at winning 'big' games. The man is a great strategist. His drawback was that he struggled to put teams in the bottom half of the table away. 

To be honest, in hindsight I'm not so much sure this was down to Rafa as a strategist or just the way we played football. We had a pretty defensive setup and for the majority of the Rafa era we were relying on Gerrard and Torres (or Kuyt when Torres was frequently injured) to wear defences down and carve them open without much help from the rest of the side.

Our team all-round was great against big teams who would play football against us and give space to players like Torres - on a good day it lead to complete demolitions of teams like Real Madrid and United. But against teams like West Ham or Fulham who were happy to just park the bus and nick a point, we always seemed to be pretty lacking in ideas. If Torres couldn't magic something or Gerrard couldn't score from 30 yards then we'd typically just be stuck with 0-0 or 1-1. Except in cup games where trying to nick a point isn't a thing, and sides would basically be forced to play football against us. 

Rodgers also has had the benefit of managing Liverpool in an era where teams come to Anfield and try and get three points. When Benitez took over, pretty much everyone who came to Anfield besides Man Utd and Arsenal would be more than happy to leave with a point, and most visiting teams had the sole intent of just being frustrating and difficult to play against rather than chase a victory.

false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"As well as the aspect that rydleo pointed out on needing 3 teams to have bad seasons being less likely than just 2 teams, I think the biggest difference, as you kind of say, is in how the figures are calculated.

It's easy, especially when going for a hype figure of ""omg less than Torres lol"", to skew the figures - namely by completely ignoring inflation, and by entirely focusing on transfer fees which are a meaningless measure of value unless they're from the last 12 months. Ronaldo was clearly not actually worth just £12m the season United sold him - that's why Real Madrid were happy to pay £80m. 

TomkinsTimes will take a sensible measure of squad value, by assessing what each individual player is worth *right now* and so giving a fair value which is useful for comparison. Meanwhile that Yahoo article lists players like Mario Suarez and Koke as being worth £0, because Atletico brought them through a youth system rather than paying for them, which is nonsense because they're clearly worth more than that now. Likewise it lists Diego Costa's value based on a 4 year old transfer fee, completely ignoring any player development and therefore increase in value since then. Big difference between squad worth and money paid. 

I'm sure Atletico's squad value was still a long way off RM and Barca, but at the same time if you calculate it in any sensible way (as the article in the OP almost certainly does) it's going to be a much higher value than Yahoo are claiming it was.

EDIT: I also think a big difference is that TT probably don't account for player potential when they're doing their stats - because it doesn't matter to the player value in a particular season whether the player is at the end of their career or the start - it's how much they're worth *in that season*. The TT values are basically the same kind of deal as Fantasy Football player values. On the other hand the likes of transfermarkt definitely include future player potential (i.e. younger players are typically worth more than older players) because they're trying to balance real-world transfer fees where potential is important.

I'd say would probably explain why the likes of us and Arsenal are higher up on transfermarkt compared to the TT stats, as we have much younger squads. For example, Lovren, Skrtel and Sakho as younger players are all worth more on transfermarkt than Terry or Ivanovic, yet in terms of their value for winning the league *this year*, I'd take the Chelsea players as having a larger number easily.

**Manquillo** has been our best defender this season when it comes to actually defending, and 
considering what was known and expected of him and what he cost to bring in it's even better.

**Emre Can** looks worth his £10m fee, he looks much more accomplished than a 20 year old usually does. It's a shame he had that injury but since he returned I think he's been our best midfielder. Surprised he didn't start against Palace, especially with Henderson out, even though Allen played well. Would love to see him and Allen as a pairing in front of our defence for at least a run of a couple of games whilst Henderson is returning to match fitness.

**Sterling** has obviously faded in recent weeks but he started like fire, 3 goals early on leaves him as our top scorer. Simply put, his best has been Liverpool's best this year.

**Lallana** is has a similar story to Emre Can in that he's been one of our better midfielders since he returned form injury. With 1 goal, 1 assist and a few MOTM performances he's right up there as a top attacking contributor for us this season. If we go back to a 4-4-2 diamond at some point I'd like for him to start some games in the no.10 role over Sterling.
