There are varieties of hostility to certain elements of immigration and certain immigrants, these include:

2. Immigrants who wish to implement in Britain alien, backward and repressive traditions – and consider these traditions to be superior to British law.

3. Illegal immigrants who fraudulently claim asylum, and consume welfare benefits.

4. Immigrants – legal or otherwise – who undercut local unskilled workers.

I went for this one with Virgin Media: http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/phones/cheap-broadband#virgin20

Equivalent to £23.72 per month for 18 months.

Newbies who sign up to Virgin Media* using this Broadbandchoices link can get fibre optic broadband and line rental for the equivalent of £23.72/mth. Here's how:

Fibre optic broadband. Sign up via the link above and you'll pay £4/mth for the first 8 months. It's then £15.50/mth for the next 10 months.

Line rental is compulsory: It's £15.99/mth or £144 if you pay the first year upfront (equivalent to £12/mth). To pay upfront, sign up, then call 0845 840 7777 once your installation date's confirmed, and request the Line Rental Saver option.

Analysis - this is a great deal for fibre

We explain how the deal works above. But with broadband, different companies use different promotional formats. So we like to help you make a fair comparison.

The following analysis excludes call costs, as they depend on you as an individual. If you need a new line, it's free. The router's also free and you don't pay delivery.

If you pay line rental upfront. The total broadband and line rental cost over 18 months is £426.94, equivalent to £23.72/mth.

If you pay line rental monthly. The total broadband and line rental cost over 18 months is £474.82, equivalent to £26.38/mth.",0,1413303411,null,0,false,0,cl990ig,t3_2j7dxp,t1_cl990ig,t3_2j7dxp,null,1426532167,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

They avoid controversy by saying ' stop non medical research' but then the list of their remaining points are all relevent to the medical and pharmacutical industry anyway.

Cancer treatment for breast cancer usually involves a drug called Herceptin^(TM) however the issue arises in that this drug is an antibody produced by genetically altered mice or other animals, specifically for the patient, as they create chimera antibodys to improve tolerance within the body. This is also carried out on other cancer therapies as its effective and many drugs in phase 1 and 2 trials are also these styles of treatment.

As a result of this, the everyday practice of using animals for research and for use in creating new methods for data recording (ie new novel ways of using antibiotics) is limited. This in turn leads to the British pharmaceutical industry being put under pressure as it makes a significant amount of drugs which are both tested on or created from animal products.

Yes you can do some in vitro tests not on animals  on human cell lines instead, but the results are heavily limited due to the fact that you cant use specific tissues and the cell line isn't a whole organism.

For a party to be present in the debate, I'd argue they have to represent a nationally-focussed party. An independent candidate, or a one-county party, for example, probably doesn't have a lot to bring to a party leaders debate in the buildup to a national election. 10 (or whatever number) candidates standing and 10k membership potentially limit the list to more serious parties. 

Requiring an MP means that elsewhere-focussed parties (like UKIP last time around) have to put forward some semblance of a proposition in the UK, not just in Europe or local councils, before they are involves in the debates.

I don't get what bringing poll support adds to this, other than ambiguity. If you run a political party, and you have an MP and enough membership, and a few candidates, you know you will be part of the debate, without worrying about the results of a poll (which is as likely influenced by yesterday's news as a year of campaigning).

I had a quick look at the stats for current major parties, and I reckon these are good criteria:

- 1 MP
- 100 candidates

And let's put it another way - who would be in the debates with these criteria? Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, Greens, UKIP. Sounds about right to me.

I decided to check this one out. Over the course of 89 competitive (League &amp; Cups) games under Redknapp, 43 were against opposition that finished higher than us in the football pyramid (including Leicester, Burnley and Derby last year). We won 9, drew 12 and lost 22.

In terms of goals, under Harry we've scored 33 and conceded 66 against these 'higher' opposition teams. A clean 1:2 ratio.

The record for the 46 games against 'lesser' opposition is 24 won, 11 drawn and 11 lost. 59 goals scored, 43 conceded. Ratio of 1.37:1.

Looking over all of these games, i'd say there was only one spell where it looked like he might be a savvy appointment who could do us well, back in the 12/13 season. From the victory at Chelsea until the home victory over Sunderland (where Townsend scored that screamer) the record was 4 wins, 4 draws and 1 loss.

Planned changes due to TTIP and TISA may guide their view of 'human rights' as well. 

So it will boil down to establishing new constructs that find sneaky ways to goals such as privatising UK public services and migrating existing safety nets inot more tiered services which allow extremely low cost global providers into the market.. that will create new businesses' ""rights"" which override those of humans. 

With TISA (Trade in Services Agreement) in the wings with its radical ""liberalisation"" of services, particularly formerly public services, and mandatory, wide reaching changes in the procurement of such services, those low cost providers, ie. foreign firms - will be often be the low bidders, winning contracts in the newly privatized services such as education, heathcare, utilities, indigent (SRO) hotels, as well as computing and office related services..

Foreign-based firms, will have a new right to bring in their own workers. The way it will be done in TISA will probably resemble the pre-existing (WTO) GATS FTA's underutilized *fourth mode of supply*, cross border trade in skilled workers. 

So, I could see human rights laws being repurposed to facilitate TISA's mandate to allow companies to use their discretion in staffing positions from anywhere in their global work forces (as long as they are treated according to local law and paid local minimum wages, perhaps sans benefits like health care, as they will probably come with their own health coverage from home.) That will probably be a trigger to a requirement that healthcare shift to an insurance-based system like that in the US, but all of the countries will take on a more international quality with many healthcare related services being delivered via telemedicine internationally.

Whether a service must be privatised under GATS is based on both a negative and positive list structure - with the positive list being based on market access requests- whether other countries request equal treatment- which will be likely due to the services/worker situation. [See here for more on the ambiguities and how little protection](http://www.princeton.edu/jpia/past-issues-1/2006/8.pdf) the existing situation offers.

Basically, there may be a shift coming which includes everything by default (the ""US approach"") Then it will be included in the privatization mandate unless it is carved out in advance or if it passes or fails a two pronged GATS test as to whether it is supplied ‘in the exercise of governmental authority’. 

Passing that test requires them to be supplied (a) not on a commercial basis, and (b) not in competition with any other service supplier. Any services which will fail that test mustl be privatised so as to not be a ""unreasonable"" (extremely broadly defined) trade barrier or market access barrier to trading partners. (firms in the other FTA countries, very low cost providers of those services.)

GATS - seems to me to already apply in the UK to health care (See the work of Allyson Pollock, generally) , but it is also explicitly borrowed from by TTIP and TISA. It almost certainly will mandate the elimination of market access barriers and trade barriers to trading partners like below market fee structures.

That will probably mean that human rights related immigration would need to be scaled back as to avoid a backlash against foreigners as more and more workplaces are impacted by the changes.

false,flaps16,lfcflame,,"""Raheem Sterling’s omission from the England team for a Euro 2016 qualifying match and the furore it created both have the same symptom – Roy Hodgson’s chronic failure to communicate effectively.
The predictable mistake is to view it solely as club versus country, that the will of an employer is being forced upon a resentful, bridling national team which, in turn, is determined not to be dictated to. The reality is more prosaic. This is not the battle of wills that it seems to be.
That the breakdown in the England manager’s communications with Liverpool, his former club, is now absolute cannot be in any question. For the past six weeks, barbs have been traded, mutual suspicion has grown and relationships have deteriorated to the point where it would not be an exaggeration to question whether or not they are already beyond repair. That Hodgson failed to contact Brendan Rodgers for a full month after Daniel Sturridge was injured in training is indicative of an impasse that is damaging all involved.
At the root of the problem is Liverpool’s growing suspicion that Hodgson does not act with the kind of duty of care they expect of an international manager. Why do they view things this way? Because of comments Hodgson has made even more so than his methods. A year ago, Sturridge suffered another thigh strain while in training with the England squad. Despite struggling with the injury, the forward was pressed into action by Hodgson who used him for the full 90 minutes of a friendly against Germany. That, of course, was the England manager’s right.
Liverpool were disappointed, particularly as Sturridge was not fit enough to start their subsequent Premier League game, which just happened to be the Merseyside derby. But like any other club which has players of international quality any complaints they might have had were undermined by the reality that Hodgson had merely done what he felt was right for himself and the England team. What followed, however, skewed things. Instead of recognising the need for diplomacy to deal with what was a delicate situation, Hodgson gave Liverpool cause for concern and annoyance.
“I wanted to test his resolve a little bit,” Hodgson explained in typically ham-fisted fashion and with that Rodgers’s goodwill to one of his predecessors at Liverpool was put to significant test. Going a stage further, Hodgson then insisted that he wouldn’t “apologise for it” and maintained that players “are better getting injured now (than closer to the World Cup).” The message, to Liverpool at least, was clear – Hodgson was showing scant consideration for the state in which he returned players to their clubs. Gerard Houllier’s analogy about international managers being like joyriders who take cars without permission before abandoning it in a field without any petrol needed no greater example.
Had Hodgson kept his counsel and said nothing, Liverpool might only have been dismayed by the state that Sturridge was returned to them . By opening his mouth, Hodgson not only gave them added reason for resentment, he also lost the moral argument. Despite this, Liverpool have continued to provide several players for the national team with six being drawn from Anfield for the World Cup finals in Brazil (more than from any other club) and four for England’s recent double-header against San Marino and Norway. If this is a club v country battle then Liverpool aren’t putting up much of a fight.
Of course, Sturridge’s absence from England’s two most recent fixtures is a major bone of contention. As soon as Rodgers insisted Sturridge would not join up with Hodgson’s squad, further acrimony became inevitable. The Liverpool manager was lambasted in some quarters but Hodgson, wisely and perhaps diplomatically, accepted his verdict and planned without Sturridge who is only now returning to fitness. But the damage had already been done by then.
Hodgson, not particularly wisely and certainly not diplomatically, had made comments that would colour the thinking of any manager and it does not take a major leap of the imagination to presume that they were at the root of Sterling’s withdrawal.
At face value, Hodgson disputing the version of events presented by Rodgers about how Sturridge came to be injured is just a case of a manager protecting his own interests. Whereas Rodgers claimed Sturridge had told England’s medical staff that he required a 48-hour recovery period after games, Hodgson insisted he “had no memory of Daniel telling me that he did not want to train.” Continuing to take Sturridge at his word, alarm bells rang out at Anfield and, although it remains unconfirmed, it appears that Rodgers made it clear to his England contingent that if they had any concerns about their fitness or wellbeing while on international duty they should express them to the manager and his staff.
By admitting that he felt fatigued, Sterling did just that. To his credit, Hodgson acted responsibly and acted in the best interests of player, club and country by naming the winger as one of his substitutes rather than in his starting eleven. His good work was undone once again by what he said rather than what he did, however, as Hodgson made a private conversation public and in doing so put Sterling at the centre of a damaging debate about his commitment to the cause. Like his previous comments about Sturridge, it was all totally avoidable and totally unnecessary.
Hodgson’s ability to say the wrong thing at the wrong time is now well established. Only last week he had to apologise for comments about the Liverpool accent which, though not delivered with any kind of malice, were foolish enough to put himself at the heart of an unnecessary and distracting controversy. At times, his foibles can be endearing like an ageing uncle with a knack of being unintentionally funny when trying to be deadly serious. But on other occasions it can impede his ability to manage England as well as possible because it undermines his admittedly delicate relationship with clubs. There may be a club versus country confrontation going on, but the biggest battle is for Hodgson to find ways of expressing himself in a way that creates friends rather than enemies.
“I think I should speak to Brendan,” Hodgson said after publicly questioning Liverpool’s training regime and there is no question that a managerial tête-à-tête would be in everyone’s best interests. Hodgson and Rodgers could do a lot worse than enlist Steven Gerrard, a future ambassador for club and country who knows better than most the rigours of representing both, to provide insight and guidance.
But more than anything else, Hodgson needs to find a way of reassuring Liverpool that he does have their interests at heart rather than just his own when it comes to looking after players because that is not the impression they have right now.""",0,1413304816,null,0,false,0,cl99rnc,t3_2j7g0x,t1_cl99rnc,t3_2j7g0x,null,1426531817,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

""In the UK, groundwater provides 35% of our drinking water. Groundwater is also important to 
support surface water flow and regulate the health of ecosystems. Concerns have been raised about 
the possible contamination of groundwater by methane, fracking fluid chemicals, and dissolved 
contaminants in flowback water, as a result of shale gas operations. 
In Britain, most aquifers used for drinking water lie within the first 300 metres below the surface, 
while fracking operations would take place at a depth of more than two kilometres. Assuming wells 
are properly constructed, contamination of groundwater through migration of methane and fracking 
fluids from shale formations to shallow aquifers through stimulated fractures could only take place if 
the fractures are able to propagate vertically through the intervening layers of rock. Recent analysis

Residential property purchase as an investment will mean your parents will have a very concentrated portfolio. Say they need some capital because they want a new car, for example, they can't just sell a few bricks from the second house, where they could sell some shares for example.

Set against that, residential property has (generally) been a very successful investment for people, as property prices have increased significantly over the years.

Another consideration is that residential property management takes effort. Either you pay 15% of your rent to an estate agent who will still contact you regularly with queries, or you deal directly with your tenants. 

Either way they can expect lots of phone calls, and bills when the roof needs repairing or the kitchen floods, or the hallway needs repainting.

There is also the issue of void periods. You might make £500 per month from a £100,000 house, which is a gross income yield of 6% PA. If the house is empty for 2 months because tenants leave this would drop to 5%. Add in a non-paying tenant that needs evicting and the income plummets.

In summary, it is a high risk proposition owning a BTL property as a main asset. As part of a diversified portfolio it can work well, but I wouldn't want to bet my income (particularly if the income is required) on just the one BTL.

false,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"This is a very good comment. I would like to add council houses to the list, skills imbalance, and immigration control to the list. 

**Council housing**

I watched the documentary ""The Battle for Barking"" about labours/margret hodges fight with BNP in Barking.  One of the main concerns expressed was access to council housing and with the cost of private renting compared to council rent who can blame them.  They felt that immigrants were getting unfairly put to the front of the queue, and the BNP were ruthlessly exploiting this. 

**Skills imbalance**

Skills imbalance is a way of saying we get a lot of low skilled, low earning immigrants ( shop assistants, factory production line workers) and we get very few high skilled high earning immigrants ( Doctors, engineers ).  This is a real imbalance and means we see an over abundance of low skilled workers and a shortage of not just doctors but people who are going to create the work for low skilled workers.  High earners also pay a lot of tax. Labour may complain about Britian turning in to a ""low cost, low skill economy"" but if keep ""importing"" low skilled workers we will have no choice but to be a ""low cost, low skill economy"". 

**Britain has ""done it's share""/ Britain is full**

Many places in Britain have already expanded to accommodate an influx of migrants.  Doctors surgeries have expanded into their parking lots, Schools have built portacabins and extensions into playgrounds, house prices are rocketing. There is a sense amongst some that britain that all the slack has been taken up and there isn't really room unless we expand rapidly at great expense.

**Immigration comes in uncontrolled lumps**

Britain has no control over how many immigrants come at any one time. This could mean fitting in 2 million extra people in two years it could mean fitting in 200,000  year.  Without control we cannot plan the infrastructure improvements that are needed.

I think again it cannot be said often or loudly enough. **British people are who are against immigration are against immigration itself and NOT the immigrants themselves**.

1. I'd buy out my landlord's house and let my flatmates live here rent free. It's one of those expenditures that would be amazing to never have to worry about, and I love these people like family so...

2. Talking of family, I'd pay off my parent's debts, I'd give them the cash to buy out their house in Chile and pay off the rest of their English mortgage. I'd also treat my Dad to any new car of his choosing and my mum to land so she could care for more than just her three dogs full time.

3. I'd buy myself a couple of cars, an Aston Martin DB4 Volante for showing off and a Morris Traveller for daily driving. I'd obviously never have to worry about petrol and Tax again.

4. I'd permanently sponsor my University Paintball team for life, given that it still exists once I and the rest of the current team graduate.

Back to basics: A gilt is literally lending your money to the government. They pay you a regular interest payment (a coupon) and the capital back at maturity (the par value, always given notionally as £100). They usually have a maturity date but not always, and they can be index linked (more complicated).

A gilt is considered a risk-free investment **only if it is held until maturity**. This is important. You buy a 10 year gilt for multiples of £100, know it will pay you 2% interest, and your money back in ten years.

But what happens if you need the money back earlier?

There is a secondary market for gilts, and in general terms this is where you see fluctuations in value.

The initial pricing (and secondary market value) of gilts is based on expectation for long-term interest rates. The government will only sell gilts that other people will want to buy, so the pricing is considered to be efficient.

The following is cribbed from a Telegraph article:

&gt;  Gilt prices are affected by interest rates, inflation and the general expectations of the economy. In general, if interest rates are expected to rise the price of gilts will fall, and if rates are expected to fall their prices will rise.
&gt; 
&gt; The price will depend on how attractive the 4.75pc coupon is at that time. With interest rates at 3pc, a 4.75pc return looks attractive and so the price will be higher than the £1,000 nominal value. However, if interest rates were 8pc, say, the coupon of 4.75pc would look unattractive and so the price would fall below £1,000.
&gt; 
&gt; That's gilts in a nutshell. If you buy a holding of £1,000 nominal of 4.75pc Treasury Stock 2010 you will get £47.50 income a year until 2010, plus you will get back £1,000 when the gilt matures. 

This also means that you could buy a gilt at above par and have a known capital loss if held until maturity. For this reason there are two figures used for the income provided by gilts, the ""running yield"" (the actual percentage income provided set against the purchase price), and the ""redemption yield"" (the yield plus the capital gain or minus the capital loss if held until maturity, spread over the remaining time).

---

Onto your question:

You should never really buy gilts in the expectation of a capital return, because the capital value and yield are inversely proportional you should expect to make the redemption yield if held until redemption. If this is above inflation over the period then great, you've made an above-inflation return by virtue of the income produced. Pretty similar to outpacing inflation with a bank account.

As part of a diversified portfolio they make more sense (which is how Tim Hale consider them), and this is because of their ""relative value"" and correlation with other assets. Generally speaking, gilts appreciate when equity markets flounder, due to supply and demand following a ""flight to safety"". A typical 60/40 equity/gilt portfolio historically would have done very well.

There needs to also be a mention of Quantitative Easing at this point - the Bank of England pumped money into the financial system by purchasing gilts on the secondary market, effectively providing liquidity and effectively unlimited demand. This had the intended effect of reducing the yield achievable with gilts, and therefore massively inflating their capital value. 

This process has meant that gilts are at their most expensive they have ever been in relative terms, making holding them look unattractive and pushing money into ""real assets"" (equities, property, spending and so on).

The often-suggested Vanguard Lifestrategy 60% equity fund has a 40% ""fixed interest"" holding, but it doesn't just hold UK Gilts. It holds global sovereign and AAA bonds, hedged back to GBP. In theory this should iron out the effects of local manipulation like QE, though I would mention the world's largest bond issuer (the US) has also been manipulating their markets in a similar fashion.",0,1413308351,null,0,false,0,cl9bo9z,t3_2j766c,t1_cl9bo9z,t3_2j766c,null,1426530919,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5

false,SuperSonic4,eu,Burrrmin'am,"&gt; There is no right wing conspiracy. If you look at any discussion about who to include and who not to include then you will see that there are many factors that could come into deciding it.

Is it a conspiracy if it's overt? Granted our definitions on right wing may differ but it's not unfair to say the right is more broadcast than the left. I'm not saying it's a conspiracy mind

&gt; 1) MPs? Should the nationalist party's be included? The SNP are the third largest party in the UK and could argue that being excluded would unfairly damage their electoral chances. Also which green party? the Green party of England and Wales or the Green party of Scotland, they have different policies. 2)Polls? Which polls? They change all the time and would it make sense to rank ukip higher than the lib dems when they have many many more MPs. 3) People with a chance of being prime minister? 4) projected MPs? 5) party size? 6) past electoral performance?

You wouldn't use just one. Regarding 1 you can hold three debates: 1 for Scotland and 1 for England and Wales and 1 for NI. The Green Party of Scotland and SNP can be on the Scottish panel as I suspect they don't plan to stand in England and Wales. Plaid Cyrmu is more difficult to place.

My preference would be a combination of 1, 4 and 5 together with a new one: 7) place on the political spectrum to ensure a fairer debate. Much like BBC comedies must have a certain amount of women in them a political debate must have representation of both left and right.

&gt; 

&gt; My personal preference is either for 5 or 2, probably both debates on separate nights. The point I am making though is that it is not an easy decision to make on who is in and who is out. To argue that there is no reasonable way in which UKIP could be included and the greens excluded ergo it is media conspiracy is ridiculous. 

A largely right wing press is going to be more favourable to a right wing party. That's no conspiracy.

&gt;On all 6 ways to judge UKIP are either equal to or ahead of the greens, especially polls and projected MPs.

Numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 of your list (especially 2) are all influenced by media coverage.

&gt; At the end of the day though the people that organize these debates have to draw a line somewhere, it was a shame that the Greens were on the wrong side of it and I hope we can get them to redraw it but I can still respect that it was a tough call.

I can respect it being a tough call  but it doesn't make it the right call. Of course I shouldn't jump to conclusions as they are still only proposals",0,1413308459,null,0,false,0,cl9bqdn,t3_2j76mz,t1_cl9bqdn,t1_cl98eqm,null,1426530887,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

* On his twitter bio he lists himself as a ""Proud American, Angelino, &amp; Evertonian""

My point was, why does it matter if somebody passes the ball backwards to set up a goal? It's still a goal. Lamela actually has 3 assists in the league, which isn't bad at all; but this was talking about Siggy and whether he could have made it for us. It's obvious he has the ability, yet some people refuse to see it, despite the fact it's obvious to see in game, and the stats back it up.

Yeah, I was completely joking about Hugo. I was just trying to show how focusing on whether a player completes an X% of forward passes is relatively pointless. It's purely a matter of circumstance. Nearly every footballer in the premiership would much rather pass the ball forward, however, this isn't always possible. It's much better to play slightly fewer forward passes, whilst retaining possession, than having a high percentage of passes go forward but fewer of them reach their target. It's obvious that Siggy does complete quite a lot of forward passes, as he has the second most assists in the league. The vast majority of the time assists tend to be forward, given the very nature of scoring in a goal that is ahead of your own.

It's not dodging the question to say we can't predict the future, but I really hope you'll put your life savings in the stockmarket, seeing as you're so confident. 

I was pretty sure from your persistence and insistence that you voted against independence, and I guessed that your opinion was already that Scottish independence would be economically a bad idea, long before the 18th of last month. 

A quick glance at your submission history [shows I was right.](http://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/2guj4o/salmond_even_loses_like_a_smug_prick/)

For the sake of completeness: a pro-independence Scot would probably argue that Salmond's predictions accounted for the worst-case scenario as well as the best (that's what any professional would do, doing any kind of predictions) and point out that [the current oil price is just fine on a 5-year basis.](http://i.imgur.com/nwL3rDt.png)

Please understand that that is not a position I'm advancing, because not only am I neither an oil-industry expert or a stock-market gambler, but also I don't give a fuck.

If pressed, a pro-independence scot would probably argue that it's more about freedom and representation than it is about pure cash numbers. And, whilst not Scottish myself, let me say I would be inclined to agree with that. 

All you've done today is show how predictable all this shit is. You've got an opinion on the subject, so you want to make me share one of my own, so you can ram your arguments down my throat and show me how right you are.

This was a reply to a previous post regarding the nature of the economy in the south, there is a great deal of myth regarding it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are you basing that on? The south even during the crisis had was ranked higher than the UK in the [Human Development Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index), meaning it had a higher standard of living. It's Economy has [rebounded](http://tribune.com.pk/story/709754/faster-growth-moodys-upgrades-ireland-by-2-notches/). In fact they paid back loans [Early](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/ireland-in-talks-to-repay-imf-portion-of-bailout-loans-early-1.1877465). 

Northern Ireland is the [Economic Basket Case](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/northern-ireland-is-the-lame-duck-of-the-uk-29669915.html) and has been for some time. Being Part of the UK has had a [deeply negative](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/over-a-quarter-of-northern-ireland-workers-paid-less-than-the-living-wage-29730081.html) impact on the economy on this part of the island. Borders in general have negative economic impacts, but it has been disastrous for this island.

&gt; A product of the balance of coercion between Britain and nationalist Ireland in 1920,
&gt; the partition of Ireland installed an erratic and meandering international boundary of
&gt; 450km, cross-cutting 1400 agricultural holdings and 180 roads, and bisecting villages and even some individual houses ...  (O’Dowd et al., 1995: 274). 
 
&gt; From a more economic perspective, the Irish border shares many of the characteristics which Mitko et al. (2003) suggests are typical of other border or frontier regions, and which may be contributing to their underdevelopment. For example,Mitko et al. (2003: 21) cite low population densities in border areas in Southeastern Europe which, it has been argued, may lead to a lack of agglomeration economies and a reduction in the scope for local cooperation
&gt;  and learning (Petrakos and Tsiapa, 2001). ^[Source](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforInternationalBordersResearch/Publications/WorkingPapers/MappingFrontiersworkingpapers/Filetoupload,175403,en.pdf)

If you need a stark image to realise the negative impact on Infrastructure and it's subsequent effects on both sides of the border take a look at this [image](http://www.discoveringireland.com/images/stories/Ireland/train_routes.jpg) this covers the railway network, but could be taken as an indicator as to the serious underdevelopment of all areas of the economy, never mind the doubling up and replication of services due to having two separate states on this tiny Island. Partition quite simply is bad for the Economy.

The untold story of the peace process, is that cross border co-operation has been its greatest success story, every effort has been to minimise the effect of the border.

&gt; There is now general agreement that inter-firm cooperation through networks, partnerships and supply-chains can, by facilitating knowledge exchange and reducing
&gt; transaction costs, contribute both to innovation and company competitiveness (Oerlemans et al, 1998). Dense patterns of “association’, alongside links between firms and other support institutions, have also been linked to cluster and regional growth(Cooke and Morgan, 1998). Case-studies of areas with high levels of such inter-organisational cooperation have generally also been characterised by social and economic uniformity, geographical contiguity, high levels of social capital (including, in particular, trust), and stable and supportive governance and support institutions (Braczyk et al., 1998). **Border regions are often characterised by exactly the opposite conditions: economic discontinuity, low levels of social capital, and governance which is at best divided, and at worst, antagonistic (Mitko et al., 2003). The result can be both a lack of knowledge sharing, diffusion and organisational learning (Petrakos and Tsiapa, 2001), and disproportionately
&gt; low levels of trade. In this context, cross-border cooperation can play an important role, countering the structural discontinuity of border regions and generating a potentially positive growth dynamic**. ^[Source](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforInternationalBordersResearch/Publications/WorkingPapers/MappingFrontiersworkingpapers/Filetoupload,175403,en.pdf)

There is a trend in this Sub to spout overly simplified economic arguments ""such as NI needs 11Bn to be supported, the South doesn't have it"" it is indicative of a complete lack understanding of economics. First of all,  no one asks what led to the situation where we have to be spoon fed, why are we so reliant on subsidies, why is the economy stagnant? It has little to do with the troubles because Northern Ireland has not been a Net Contributor to the UK since the 1930's.

&gt; The weakness of the Northern Ireland economy became apparent in the 1930s, with its reliance on traditional industries which went into decline during the decade. Economic decline, halted only by the Second World War, put strain on Northern Ireland's social structure. ^[Source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/sectarian/brewer.htm)
&gt; 

The reality is that Northern Ireland was only really Economically Viable for about 8 or 9 years of its existence with mild reprieve during WW2, Creating an artificial state on this island was a dreadful mistake economically. The only saving grace was the [Welfare State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c86Gwsb5LY). 
If you have not been paying attention it is under attack. At the moment a free trade Agreement is being Negotiated; EU/US Free Trade Agreement (or TTIP). It will have a devastating impact on public services. The minimal advantages of being Part of the UK, such as the NHS, [won't exist](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/privatisation-agenda-drives-tory-policy-on-nhs-says-andy-burnham-9052640.html) in the near future. 

&gt; The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership The European Commission (EC) is currently involved in negotiating an FTA of unprecedented scale between the US and European Union (EU). This is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (or TTIP). The initial aim was to conclude negotiations at great speed (or ‘on one tank of gas’) by November 2014. It now seems that towards the end of 2015 is more realistic.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to reducing tariffs and increasing protection for transnational investors, TTIP also aims to remove (or ‘harmonise’) regulatory barriers that restrict profitable trade between the US and EU.  These ‘barriers’ are often our most prized and hard-won regulations and standards that protect, for example, our labour rights, environment, food safety, digital privacy, and banking standards.^[Source](http://www.patients4nhs.org.uk/eu-us-free-trade-agreement-or-ttip/)

The advantages of being in the UK are being swept away, the Economic arguments for the state of Northern Ireland are paper thin (and on the verge of being torn to shreds). There are real economic advantages to an All Ireland state that have yet to be tapped. The trend of business is already seeking greater co-operation north and south, it is time for the institutions to follow suit. 

In terms of a border poll real searching questions have to be asked, Has the Northern Ireland experiment worked? What would be good for the Economy? We can not perpetually hide behind myth or an Emotional attachment to Identity Politics

My thoughts where that whatever the price of oil, it *will* undoubtedly effect our financial planning (Good or bad)

Look at my example in the last comment. There's all this evidence stacked against the accused. From his clothes to his appearance to what he would steal, it's pretty obvious to everyone that he's guilty. *However*  that still isn't beyond a reasonable doubt. The guy who burgled the house has two matching articles of clothing with the defendant, so what? That's not uncommon among an age group. If you got every person the same sex and age as you in Belfast and went through their clothes you could probably find some things you both have. The burglar had black hair, so what? So does like half of males. A Smiths album was stolen, so what? Maybe the burglar just picked anything up, or maybe the Smiths are that good that anybody would have picked it up (they are that good). 

It doesn't matter if the accused was the burglar, the evidence against him simply isn't good enough for a sane person to have no reasonable doubt. He cannot be found guilty on that evidence alone. Considering that thousands and thousands of people's jobs around the world are to literally make people have reasonable doubt, then it's not too hard to see how some people just every so often get off with something.

&gt;

&gt;The appointment of __Knight Bachelor__ (__Kt__) is a part of the [British honours system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_honours_system).

&gt;It is the most basic and lowest rank of a man who has been [knighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight) by the monarch but not as a member of one of the organised [Orders of Chivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_order). Knights Bachelor are the most ancient sort of British knight (the rank existed during the 13th century reign of [King Henry III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_III_of_England)), but Knights Bachelor rank below knights of the various orders.

&gt;There is no female counterpart to Knight Bachelor. The lowest knightly honour that can be conferred upon a woman is [Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Commander_of_the_Most_Excellent_Order_of_the_British_Empire) (DBE) - which, technically, is one rank higher than Knight Bachelor (being the female equivalent of 'KBE' or [Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Commander_of_the_Most_Excellent_Order_of_the_British_Empire), which is the next male knightly rank above Knight Bachelor).

[That's not true.](http://whovianfeminism.tumblr.com/post/42795329060/the-bechdel-test-and-doctor-who-so-whats-the-big) The series passed the Bechdel test at least 70% of the time from 2005-2009 and every single episode featured at least two named female characters. When Moffat takes over, the percentage of episodes passing the test drops radically. (If you lower the standards for passing the test, [RTD's score increases to 89%](http://rebeccaamoore.com/2014/05/29/university-study-on-sexism-in-bbcs-doctor-who-infographic/) while Moffat also gains a minor improvement that at least lets half of his episodes pass.)

Your claim that 90% of his episodes pass the test is nonsense.

Barkley was honestly underwhelming. EA didn't give him that good of a card, so i eventually had to get rid of him. Jags was pretty good. The only one that i was that disappointed by was Lukaku, his finishing was quite poor for me, he had a few shocking misses. He basically has the same problems that he has in real life, basically having trouble when he's not facing the goal. His dribbling was complete shit.

As for career mode I'm in my 4th season in my Everton Career mode. Barkley and Lukaku seem to be really slow growing this year. Lukaku is only an 82 after 4 seasons, and Barkley is only an 81. Stones grew to a 78, but I had to sell him off because I scouted a new cb who is 74 at age 18. I sold Jags to United after a season for around 10 mil, which was sad at first because i love him, but it was an overall good decision. Besic is up to a 78 and is now starting. I swapped Mirallas for Memphis Depay, which has turned out to be a good decision. I sold Kone and Eto'o after the first season. Baines is a beast in UT, but because he's getting older, i sold him in career to fund a move for Alaba.

You don't see many native Britons joining the line to fight in Syria. 

&gt;It is the job of the courts to weed out fraudulent claims of asylum. If anything it's not so much an epidemic of asylum fraud as the media blowing up every single instance of asylum fraud.

I'm sure those people who arrive in Italy on boats then cross *the whole of Europe* to get here are suffering so much on the Continent. Don't be daft, if you make it to Europe from some third-world hellhole and don't settle in the first free country you land in you're no longer an asylum seeker, you're an economic migrant.

&gt;People having kids ""undercuts local unskilled workers"", why not punish people who have children? This is a natural result of population growth.

Because people who are born in this country have more of a right to be here than people who aren't perhaps? The British population is barely growing, the rate of immigration artificially inflates it. Why should we have to suffer as a result of population growth than isn't our own?

A) **Balance** - There are already a LOT of ""popular music"" stations on FM - at least one Local radio, radio 1 radio 2 and a mish mash of regional stations.  The only other classical music station is ""Classic FM"". I would be very surprised if you couldn't get 4 or 5 pop music stations to the 2 classical stations. Switching this ratio to 5:1 would be arguably an imbalance

B) **Demographic** - The over 45 listener base doesn't ask for much from the BBC ( which is often considered ""youth obsessed"" ). But taking away their favourite station will draw some criticism. 

C) **Prestige** - Classical music is still considered prestigious, cultured  and ""Classy"" ( although the word classy has never been classy for some reason).  Shifting classical music off FM may well reduce it's relevance to and by extension BBC's connection with the classical music world. Giving the impression that BBC is moving ""down market"".

D) **BBC ""uniqueness""** - BBC is often criticised for using it's ""public broadcaster"" remit to chase ratings. Some people feel that BBC should be catering for things that commercial channels don't. BBC3 is the *only* classical music station that can regularly play 90 minute classical music pieces without interruption by ads.

I'd suggest speaking to an independent financial advisor (IFA).  They can talk proper shop about how much risk you are comfortable with.  That said, here's what I would say if we were in the pub:

No-risk: Go to moneysavingexpert and look up their top rate cash ISA.  Get that.  Transfer every year to whatever the new best one is.

Some-risk: Get a FTSE 100/350/whatever tracker.  They all invest in essentially the same basket of shares so they all complete on low fees.  You aren't paying a ""rockstar"" fund manager.  Short term the market fluctuates.  Long term it goes up.  Plan on leaving your cash there for at least five years.

More-risk: Your IFA can guide you here.  Tastes run from the robust, but sector specific so if e.g. Mining takes a hit then you are humped, right up to me taking out a tech based on six months before the .com bubble burst.

High-risk: No.  Here be dragons.  You could lose everything you own.

Who would have the ultimate authority to decide, would it be the English leader, or the Union leader? Giving such a power to the English leader would obviously be constitutionally dangerous, what if they attempt to effectively seize power over the Union through it, pass truly Union wide laws they merely declared were English only, and thus depriving the Welsh, Scots, and N.I. of votes on them? And giving such a power to the Union leader could make it toothless, every nook and cranny of the law would be examined for its effects on vague things, like trade, that can be interpreted expansively. The ideal might be a politically neutral body like the supreme court of the uk, but then you potentially have to wait several months to years to find out whether or not any of the laws your passing are English or Union as the issue works its way through the legal system. Also, if the Union leader retains sole power to freely submit government bills to a vote, they could simply attach any English affecting legislation as a rider to some larger Union wide bill.

During the ""Cold War"" they were an ally against communism. But do we really use them now. In fact I would say they are a liability. 

**They can NOT fight in any of our wars without inflaming arab opinion** Not Iraq 1, Iraq 2, Afghanistan OR currently ISIL/ISIS/IS. We are literally flying from Qatar and Saudi Arabia to Israels neighbour Syria, why because if we flew from Israel it would galvanise arab world against us. How it that useful?

**Israel and the West Versus the Arabs prevents us from becoming closer allies**. There is little reason we can't become closer allies with many in the middle east except that the Arab vs the West grievance means Arab leaders can't get too close to us because we are Israels allies.

**The actions of Israel against the palestinians causes anti-semitic backlash in Europe**.  There is a massive spike in Anti-semitism any time Israel has one of it's massively inequal wars with the Palestinians.  Ironically some jewish europeans move to Israel because of the backlash.

**They are one of the motivating factors for Islamic extremism against the west** There are many factor that drive Islamic extremism, But with respect to Extremism directed against the west Israel is one of the longest and most enduring motivating factors. 

*And then what are the benefits*? Some say intelligence - we could get that else where and Israel didn't know about tunnels leading into their own country - how good is their intelligence really?  Some say a bulwark against terrorism but Israel is also an indirect cause of much of that terrorism.  Honestly I don't see Israels benefit to the west anymore.

false,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"While I am not attempting to slight Dier for what he's done so far this season, as he's done very well given the circumstances, defensively RB is an easier position to play than CB. RBs have added defenders in the touch lines that CBs rarely are able to utilize and so have less space to defend. Additionally, RBs have the CB next to them as an emergency backup should they get beat. If a RB gets beat there is usually someone there to cover. If a CB gets beat, the danger increases exponentially. Dier has done very well and I must admit he's fared better than I would have suspected at the beginning of the season, but for me CB is a different beast. I'm not sure if he would have fared as well to date if he had been playing CB vs RB.

I also think the impact of playing next to Fazio hasn't really been taken into account for Vlad. Communication for a CB is more important than anything else at the highest level. Vlad had never played with Fazio before and I'm certain that communication between the two was very difficult. Vlad also strikes me as a CB who, more than others given the way he plays, needs constant communication in order to be effective. Without that constant clear communication, he has to make all the judgements of when he can be aggressive and when he can't all by himself. That is incredibly difficult at this level.

So far it's lived up to my expectations there, but obviously like I said I've not been here long. I can say though that the general feel among people on my course across the year groups is that the Creative Writing course was a big factor in their decision to study this degree here. 

Hopefully that helped a little bit, if you have any questions feel free to ask, but there's a fair chance I might not know the answer. 

Edit: Oh, I should probably also say that one thing I can say is that there isn't a single Creative Writing staff member who I've met whom I didn't like.

More community outreach by authority + give them shit to do.

My local council used to be quite police-driven for ASB, it was all reported directly to the police who then dealt with it in the *""do it again and you're nicked son""* kind of fashion. A few years ago they created a 'radical' committee to try a different approach. The focus is on non-punitive measures and fixing the root cause.

We've now got lots of community wardens (Pairs of people who walk about at night, basically), a mediation service, a team that creates bespoke events for specific areas/problems, budget set aside that the community decides where it's spent, more frequent off-license undercover age tests, more routine police beats, more CCTV cameras (The evidence of which leads into the mediation teams, not the police). They do everything they can to fix root problems before they have to resort to court cases, evictions and so on.

Palestine can be argues to not fulfil 3/4 criteria of statehood from the montevideo convention. but then there are other ways to define a state; simply being recognized by other legal states is one of them. 

personally I don't believe recognizing palestine is going to do any good because A) gaza and West bank are governed by two different bodies (Hamas and Fatah) and B) its borders are very poorly defined, even by 3rd parties to the conflict. there are parts of the area that almost everyone recognizes as palestine but then after that there is almost no agreement as to its borders, particularly from the nation it actually shares most of its border with.

I think Jenny and Vastra should have a couple conversations about each other. I'm thinking about Deep Breath and Name of the Doctor but I'd have to re-watch. 

Side note: what constitutes a conversation for the test? Let's say two women talk for 5 straight minutes and only turn to one's husband in the last 30 seconds. In another scenario, they only talk for 30 seconds but no man is mentioned. Which passes? Which conversation is ""better?"" I'd personally think 4.5/5 minutes is better than 30 seconds and cutting it short.

As far as the saving, it was all Clara in Akhaten with the leaf and Listen with the speech. I'd have to re-watch to confirm more, but when the Doctor has 2000 years of experience plus a time machine and she doesn't, there's only so much saving Clara can do while still making sense from a narrative standpoint.

Also, if it's not ok to call a country of 300 million people as ""truly awful"" - which if we're being precise isn't a quote - then would it be therefore even more inaccurate to call China awful? I'm sure there are millions there who are happy.

That's not usually the way it is interpreted.  The most common interpretation I see is that it is not sufficient for something else to be mentioned, but rather the *focus* of conversation needs to be something else.  I see most people failing a conversation if a male is mentioned at all.

And yes you would still expect most things to fail.  For example, lets say the story is a family drama.  If a young woman and her grandmother are having a conversation about her father (son),  brother, male cousin, grandfather, male friend, or lover it fails.  Now considering it is a family drama with limited time to tell the story, it is going to be focused on only those elements that move the story forward.  There is usually not a reason to include a conversation where the grandmother is teaching the granddaughter how to can raspberries.  That would pass the test, but isn't usually relevant to the story.

They certainly couldn't set out with that strategy against Fazio as he's stronger and taller than Ba by a landslide. That meant they had to target Chiriches. Another thing I noted about that match was just how poorly our DMs did to assist the CBs for much of the match. Additionally, given that our fullbacks like to get up Chiriches was far more isolated than he should have been against Ba, who we already established has the size and height advantage over Chiriches. The fullback isn't there to help. The DMs weren't there to help. Fazio is fanned out as he should be, so he can't get over to help as swiftly as necessary given that the DMs aren't doing what they should be.

Maybe it's not all about political correctness? It's more complicated than 'liberals defend child abuse' which seems to be your argument.

If you even read the fucking article, it details the reasons the police give to not investigating the child abuse properly none of them list 'fear of being accused of racism' as the reason. They actually list some of the reasons, such as 

&gt;the crime is ""difficult to prosecute"".

&gt; officers ""developed a mindset that victims in these sorts of cases would always been unreliable.
""I told them young girls were being abused but they didn't listen or resource the investigation,"" the officer said. ""They were only interested in target crimes: robbery, burglary and car theft.

&gt;""Because this kind of crime is difficult to prosecute and didn't show up quickly on crime figures they weren't interested.""

I'm not saying that there isn't a climate that dissuades officers from pursuing cases due to fear of being accused of racism, but to blame this scandal entirely on that is simplistic, and to bring up Jimmy Saville as an example of when its safe to accuse someone of paedophilia is baffling considering it took until he died for the truth to come out.

You can see the absurdity of the point being made here by going back and looking at how strongly the Conservatives objected to tuition fees being increased to £3,000, and then, when they were in government, promptly increased them to £9,000. This post is acting as if this was some closely fought ideological battle which Scottish MPs just tipped over on one side.

In what way, and how - for example - does that compare to a fast food restaurant or building a housing block. You must provide some context. And not USA context - British context. For example the wastewater regimes in the UK are completely different to those in the US.

&gt; It may increase the likelihood of your tap going on fire, but it's also true that methane bubbles up naturally in similar areas to those which are ripe for fracking.

That is completely untrue. ""Gasland"" was a fraudulent documentary. 


&gt; The are many cases where fracking appears to have polluted groundwater, in numerous documented cases very badly, with major health consequences. The reason we have less complete evidence on this than we would otherwise is because, when this is successfully taken to court, the fracking companies impose gagging orders with their large payouts to those affected. Several areas where fracking has fucked up in the US have to have large volumes of water trucked in.

Which is why I said that we are not talking about the USA, but about Britain. All sorts of things have happened in the USA but that is an entirely different regulatory and legal system. 

Also, we're talking about *now*. If we were to say ""*X happened in the past so we must never do Y again"" we'd not be getting on very well in the world. 

&gt; The industry itself says gas prices will not come down as a result of fracking.

No, it does not. The industry says that gas prices will come down as a result of fracking. As do the O+G analysts. And indeed does OPEC while lamenting the current plunge in oil prices.

&gt; Coal is shit, but no one is really suggesting it as an alternative.

&gt; Less well-paying jobs than you'd think

Your argument is that you think that I think that the job pays a certain level and so we should not create those jobs? 

&gt; , and it's also worth noting the issues that fracking-related labour has caused in the US - everything from significant increases in local crime to substantial health and safety disasters.

You keep talking about the USA. I dismiss that argument as not relevant.

Clearly not very well because you completely ignored the context. Let's look at the relevant part of Laxda's comment again. 

&gt; you've never lived there, it's actually awful

...implying that living there is enough to realise how awful it is. I merely pointed out the millions of counter examples. I don't know if you're one of those people who thinks that appealing to extremes is a valid debating technique but Saudi Arabia really wasn't relevant to the topic at hand.

&gt; it be therefore even more inaccurate to call China awful?

You're trying way too hard to hyper-analyse a comment that simply discouraged making generalisations. But yes, describing ""China"" as awful is also pretty stupid.

&gt; Or maybe you can exercise some kind of common sense and realise that you were responding to one persons opinion, just like your view is also only an opinion. An opinion based on demonstrably flawed logic, but an opinion nonetheless.

It's funny (or rather, worrying) that you think my opinion is more problematic than Laxda's.

Also revolution de Cuba is fun for cocktails and its the kind of place that isn't sticky. Every night of the week me and my house mate could find some where to get passed and have a great time.

There is a lot of shops in sheffield and also in a shopping centre called meadowhall just outside of sheffield. Jobs potential there. Also quite a few business parks in the surrounding areas. 

Also the Peak District national park is very close. A good starting point is the Fox House b&amp;b and pub. Its the first pub as you leave sheffield down past the waitrose roundabout. If you like the outdoors. Also check out the villages in the peak district, very idyllic.  

Places to avoid, Manor top, some say avoid London Road but I think it's fine. Also certain pubs when there is a football match on. I wouldn't recommend Yates or Lloyds bars but that's just my taste.

It doesn't matter who gains most. As long as they both perceive that they gain then from their perspective it's working. 

&gt;The attacks in Syria smack of selective self interest 

Assad is a regional ally of Iran and Russia. Anything that threatens his regime is in the perceived interest of the US, Israel and KSA. 

The IDF have attacked Hezbollah several times: again Hezbollah is a proxy of Iran so this is in the perceived interest of the US, Israel and KSA. 

The various covert attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities have almost certainly been carried out with the help of Israel. Again this is in the interest of the US, Israel and KSA. 

To promote its own regional interests Iran has been backing Hamas and the IDF has been trying to stop them.

Recently KSA, Iran and the US find themselves temporarily on the same side because of IS. It remains to be seen how this will affect the usefulness of Israel as a US client. 

&gt;I'm sure Israel wants to help but there is virtually no evidence that it does.

I'm sure Israel don't want to help anyone but themselves. Countries don't have friends, they have interests.

&gt;Sure there are a lot of american weapons in Israel but mostly they are gifts to the IDF

There's an element of ""follow the money"" here. The US gives aid to Israel and in turn Israel uses this to buy US kit. The main beneficiary of this is the US military-industrial complex. [This might not always be in the interests of the US.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/israel-accused-of-selling-us-secrets-to-china-1510406.html)

The difference between good logic and bad logic is that good logic can be applied without alteration to other situations. Your logic that it's wrong to call a country bad because millions of it's people are happy is bad logic because when you apply same logic to other countries then it yields inconsistent results.

Not ignoring the irony that you're saying I'm trying too hard to 'hyper-analyse' a comment in which you quote my comment on 4 different occasions but you seem to not understand that saying 'America is awful' isn't a generalisation. America is a single thing. A country. You can tell it's a single thing because 'America are awful' sounds stupid. Calling it awful is an opinion on a single thing. I think you're mistaking 'America' for 'Americans'. 'Americans are awful' is a generalisation, 'America is awful' isn't.

I'm originally a US citizen, now dual citizen with Croatia (yay EU) and I've lived in Britain for a total of about ten years since I was in my early teens. I sound English and in fact, most people have told me that they could never tell I wasn't British unless someone mentioned it to them.

I find that all of this talk of immigration is utterly useless if people don't have a basic grasp of the immigration system and how it works, and let's face it: no one does. Why would you need to if you're a citizen? It never affects you. So here's a super condensed summary:

You've got three major entry routes to the UK:

* The Points-Based system

* Non PBS visas, primarily for spouses and other dependants of British citizens

* EU/EEA nationals and their spouses and dependants

Generally speaking, here's how the Points-Based System works:

**Tier 1**

This used to be much more comprehensive, but now it's basically just for two types of people:

* People who are so well-renowned in their fields that they are internationally recognised as a leading expert, as confirmed by a panel of the relevant major academic body in their field (for example, the Royal Society). This is exceedingly rare and for only a select few.

* Very rich people willing to make a substantial investment in the UK. Again, only for a select few oligarchs and wealthy business owners.

**Tier 2**

The most common work route. This is for people who are sponsored by a company. This used to be a bit easier, but is exceptionally difficult now. First, you'll have to somehow miraculously secure a job offer from outside the UK. Then, the company will need to pay £1000 to sign up for the Register of Sponsors, which includes a full audit of the company's HR systems. This can take up to a few weeks. Any undischarged bankrupts working in HR will seriously affect that application. Then, you may apply for a certificate of sponsorship. To do this, you must meet the residential labour market test - in short, most vacancies must have been advertised in a Jobcentre Plus for around a month, and the employer must show that no UK/EU applicant who applied met the requirements as well as the migrant. This costs the employer around £400 in most cases. Also, there are minimum income requirements which change a lot, but most jobs must offer around at least £19-20k per year. After all of that is met, and the certificate is issued, the prospective worker may apply for a Tier 2 Visa. There are also caps on the number of visas issued per year. When they introduced the cap a few years ago, the government expected it to be hit within a few months. By the end of the year, they had issued around half of the total certificates allocated.

The other route is someone transferring from one office of a major multinational company to a UK branch. This is mainly used for senior management. You have to have worked for that company for at least two years overseas first. Fun fact: intra-company transferee visas attract no cap (useful for the financial services industry), and far more of these are issued than regular sponsored visas.

**Tier 3**

Reserved potentially for unskilled work permits. Has never actually been used.

**Tier 4**

Student visas. They're really cracking down now on bogus colleges, and even universities. [That has shaken many universities to the core over the last two years](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/home-office-student-visa-clampdown-rocks-sector/2014151.article). Other than the cost of the visa spiralling out of control, they're pretty straight-forward.

**Tier 5**
Mainly Youth Mobility Scheme visas, i.e. working holiday. A favourite of young Australians looking for pub work in London.

**Non-PBS Visas**

These are primarily for spouses of British citizens. However, the requirements in the last two years have become so onerous that I personally know of a few families who have either broken up or moved overseas to the other spouse's country because the income requirements and funds necessary to apply (often tens of thousands in cash) have become so difficult that it's not worth bringing the foreign spouse to the UK, which was exactly the government's intention - they'd rather the British spouse live wherever their partner's from rather than both of them come live here.

You can also sponsor dependent children and parents of British citizens. It's true that 10+ years ago, the rules for sponsoring other family members like siblings was much easier. That's probably how those extended families that run your local off-licence made it to the UK. That doesn't work any more. 

At this point, I need to note that virtually all of the visas listed above, both PBS and non-PBS, have stamped on them **NO RECOURSE TO PUBLIC FUNDS** - this basically means that the only public benefit available is contribution-based JSA (not income-based). In order to quality, you need to have made NI contributions for an uninterrupted period of 12 months.

The refugee/asylum routes also come under non-PBS. Those are largely governed by international conventions and European law so I don't know as much about them, and the measures that the government can take to crack down on them. They *do* qualify for some public funds, though.

**EU/EEA Nationals and their spouses**

All EU/EEA nationals, with the exception of Croatians, can basically live and work in the UK and be treated almost the same as a British citizen as long as they're exercising one of their treaty rights. Being unemployed isn't a treaty right. They're also making it much more difficult to claim benefits for the first couple of years you're in the UK, which is fair enough to me. If you need to be on benefits looking for work, you can do that in your own country. Also, one of the slightly controversial things here is that non-EU spouses of EU citizens can get an EU family permit and live in the UK exercising most of the same rights as their EU spouses. A lot of people don't like this, but families of EU citizens are subject to European treaties and not national immigration law. That's why I laugh when people suggest marrying a British citizen to stay in the UK; you should really marry any other EU citizen *but* British, since spouses of citizens are still subject to national and not European immigration law.

In short, coming to the UK now (and for the last six years at least) has become a remarkably difficult endeavour for non-Europeans. If you don't believe me, head over to /r/IWantOut and look at all the US-&gt;UK threads. The general advice is: fuck it. You won't have luck in the UK. Try another European country. Canada's also nice.

As an immigrant who went through the Points-Based System, I'll say this: the system is very robust (well, now at least) and relatively fair. I do have a few issues that I think are easily rectified:

* Maintain the same requirements for Tier 2 sponsorship, but make the labour market test easier and offer more concessions for those who have finished their degrees in the UK. There used to be a post-study work visa (like most countries have) but it was short-sightedly scrapped a few years ago. Really? Sure, let's take people with a good education and international skills and let them leave to make their own countries better. I can understand that the job graduate market is saturated right now, but to me, that's a symptom of a much larger structural problem with the British economy and politics, and that clamping down on post-study migrants is trying to use a kettle to put out a depot fire - it's not the right way to go about it and ultimately ineffective.

* Introduce a cap for intra-company transferees. Why should senior management get a free pass, limiting promotion from within? Unless there are linguistic or serious cultural factors that necessitate an appointment, there should be a cap on that as applications have spiked after the cap was placed on regular sponsorships.

* REINSTATE EXIT CHECKS AND MAKE ALL VISAS ELECTRONIC. Exit checks were scrapped by Tony Blair back in 1998. It was a bad idea. No one has any true clue as to how many illegals are in the UK, but the rest of Europe and most other countries use exit checks. You come in, passport stamped when you enter. You go out, passport stamped when you leave. That way, you can tell who has overstayed their visas (either as they leave, or the next time they enter). By making the system electronic, you could be notified immediately when someone overstays their visa and hasn't been 'checked out'. It also tells who who has overstayed, so you can pick them up when they eventually do leave, or make another application to remain later on.",0,1413328343,null,0,false,0,cl9mght,t3_2j80cj,t1_cl9mght,t1_cl9frdh,null,1426525743,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

On the whole, I think most immigrants find the UK to be much more welcoming than almost any other country nearby, which is rare within Europe. For those wondering, there's a lot of interesting academic writings on the subject of immigrant assimilation and different models; two of the ones often compared are civic versus cultural assimilation. In brief: most 'new' countries (US, Canada, Australia to a lesser extent) tend to be nations with very successful immigrant assimilation, because the shared icons and values of the country are often based on civic institutions and 'ideas' (rule of law, the flag, national anthems, patriotism, individualism, a shared lifestyle, *the American Dream*™) whereas Europe typically has more problems: cultural identities in Europe, due to their age, are harder to pin down, but typically rely more on religious affiliation (whether practising or not), racial identity, linguistic abilities as a marker of national pride (particularly very small languages like Danish or Lithuanian), shared historical traditions and institutions. Europe will have to change radically to achieve a point where the much easier civic integration is not only favoured, but even possible. It's hard for an outsider to ever become 'fully British' in any meaningful sense of the phrase - comparing regional jokes, making references to famous comedians of the 1970s, referring to well-known advertising jingles and programmes from childhood, these are all things that most people don't pick up when they move to a country in their 30s or 40s, so do bear that in mind. [Here's a wiki article on this subject that starts to go into it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation#Theoretical_models_to_immigrant_assimilation)

So with all of that in mind, please feel free to let me know if anyone has any questions on the immigration system in general, or specifically, or wants to know about possible solutions to perceived problems.

Perfect nuclear families or happy marriages that start from the teenage years ago go on until death are just a shared dream - everyone has skeletons in their closets - it's human nature.

Look at the amount of US preachers and priests that are having scandal after scandal - same as the Tory party in the UK.

The people that repress their feelings the most are usually the ones who explode publicly later.

If you are in power you are exposed to a greater level of temptation, and potentially have the power to cover it up - not to mention your wife or family would rather look the other way that risk destroying the illusion of marriage.

Bill Burr did a good thing about this when women her sucking their teeth and judging Tiger Woods for his affairs.

false,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"&gt; Assad is a regional ally of Iran and Russia. Anything that threatens his regime is in the perceived interest of the US, Israel and KSA.

Yes but what has israel done - enough to overthrow him? no! a few self interested attacks.  What I am saying is that Israel contrary to popular belief is NOT a US proxy and does NOT work in US interest. I know a lot of people believe that Israel is a proxy for US but there is little evidence. 

You even say

&gt;Countries don't have friends, they have interests

First Israel was an American proxy now it's a country with similar interests. Except most of the ""shared enemies"" are really enemies of Israel that have become enemies of America because America supports Israel 

&gt;The IDF have attacked Hezbollah several times: again Hezbollah is a proxy of Iran so this is in the perceived interest of the US, Israel and KSA.

Why is attacking Iran in the interest of of USA?, because Iran *MAY* have nuclear weapons, and why would Iran want nuclear weapons - because Israel has them. Hezbollah are NOT a threat to the USA. They are a threat to Israel, they are also a threat to ISIS but they a threat to USA or KSA? Iran as a threat to the US or KSA is dubious at best with perhaps a few proxy wars but most of Irans proxy wars ( Iraq and syria against ISIS ) have come AFTER Israel started beating the war drums and AFTER ISIS so the ""threat"" seems minimal and also seems mostly a political/media creation. 

&gt;The US gives aid to Israel and in turn Israel uses this to buy US kit. The main beneficiary of this is the US military-industrial complex

The main beneficiary of this is Israel. This is nothing more that the US taxpayer buying american weapons for Israel. Talking about america ""benefiting"" is disingenuous. 
  

Again I have asked for EVIDENCE that Israel is a proxy for america - It is a proxy that is highly divisive, a proxy cannot fight for america because it is a political liability, a proxy that turns countries and people against america , a proxy that create enemies for america. It can't act for america and it can't benefit america and it cost america quite a bit financially and politically. It won't always do what america wants and in fact rarely does. What sort of proxy is that? At least with KSA, Qatar and Oman we can fly fighter planes out of.  Again I put it to you that ""Israel is a US proxy"" is media created hyped up interpretation of the real relationship which is the  USA is a protector of sometimes ungrateful Israel ( The protection being militarily, politically and to some extent financially ) 

The only similarity, the only way that Israel is in alignment with america is that it is culturally very similar ( relative to the gulf states).  But again this idea that Israel is the 51st state in the middle east is NOT based on evidence. The american bases in Suadi, Qatar, Oman Kuwait and Bahrain are all better placed to help america in the it fights in the middle east. This what the real world evidence shows us.

I've always been of the opinion that replacing Gerrard was never going to be a matter of replacing the goals or the assists. If we sign a winger who gets scores and creates 20 goals apiece a season, is Gerrard replaced? No. Steven Gerrard is more than a list of statistics, Steven Gerrard can't be quantified by Damien Comolli, he can't be reduced to numbers in an algorithm. His value is immeasurable, not just because it's so vast, but because it's literally impossible to measure. It's something that's clearest when it isn't there, when there's nobody taking charge in the midfield, nobody willing to stand up and be counted.

Replacing Stevie was always about replacing the aura, the influence he'd have on his teammates. The worthy successor isn't necessarily the best player (though ability is obviously a huge factor), but more the best personality. That fact that we're now more scared of losing Henderson than we are losing Stevie speaks volumes for me.

There's a lot of competition for bentaleb's spot, and although he seems like he will be good, I don't think he should be starting ahead of Stam, capoue, dembele, (I still think paulinho can bring more to the team), and right now mason is giving him a run for his money. Neither of those players are close to retiring at any point and right now they should all be hitting their prime, so I can see him leaving.


Kane, has a beauty of a shot, but I fear that's all that he really brings. His hold up play isn't great, and his passing is bad. Every game he plays you can scratch your head 2-3 times wondering what he was thinking, either not passing to someone who was making a nice run and shooting from some ridiculous range or getting caught between pass and shoot and end up losing the ball all together. Also he seems to get bullied a lot. He's still young so he has time, but I don't seem him as a top 4 striker, which is what this clubs ambition is. People will point to all his goals, and I understand that he's scoring, but I still think this sub over hypes this guy a lot.


Ceballos on the other hand looks very good. When I was watching him in pre season I was hoping we would see this guy playing in europe. Unfortunately he wasn't listed to play, but how our front 3 have been playing this year, I can see him coming in soon if these players don't shape up a bit.

Television is trope-driven. Doctor Who isn't Breaking Bad. It's not looking to bust open the format of television. Infact, it is literally an example of the success of the 'sitcom' formula. Not only that, the BBC (and us Brits in general) are very big on celebrating heritage, and the repetition of the Doctor Who formula for 50 years, constantly reaching back and fondling elements of the original show pitch in each successive regeneration is an expression of that heritage.

The role of the companion, 50 years later, is to bridge the gap, providing us touchstones to what the show originally was, and still is.

http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/23/stephen-lawrence-undercover-police-smears

So if the need arose the police could discredit the Lawrence family and their movement.

Go Ahead .. I dare you

 but just remember whatever it is, the state will also know and they might drag that up to harm you at some point in the future. 

The effects of mass surveillance of the internet is only just coming on line and the creepiest thing is...

**....the chances are it would be so effective you would never know about it**

But what about all those people who have stood up to the state. How many of them could easily be stopped by threatening to tell people about their internet past.

After all People have lost their jobs over their twitter feed

http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/09/paris-brown-stands-down-twitter

The thing the massive amount of state power this provides only comes into effect if 

A) You stand up to the state and

B) If the state tries to use it against you.

The things is most people say "" OH.. I don't matter"" But even though you may not plan on ""fighting the government"" you may find that that fight picks you, It could be pollution in your water, it could be a fight for better medical treatment, it could be MI5 officers running amok doing ""corporate espionage"".  You can't always pick the fights you need to fight and you can't always expect them,  sometimes the fights in your life will pick you. And the state has record of all the bad things you've done on the internet to discredit you.

It is NOT supposed to be used (as it commonly is) to criticise an individual episode of a TV series.  To do that, you would need to have finer scoring than pass/fail.

false,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"To address the first bits:

&gt; Companionship is always going to be a mixed bag. As you said everyone wants different things out of a companion so there is never going to be a good consensus. Furthermore, I think some people get too caught up in what they think a companion should be and judge the characters accordingly rather than judging the character on their own merit. I think a good example of this is the disparity in people who like Rose, Martha, and Donna. People often will like one but not the others. Personally I think that they were all good in their respective roles as a companion even when their characterization occasionally took a back seat.

&gt; Personally I think that Clara's characterization has largely been good. I wasn't bothered by the whole Impossible Girl plot. Yeah it was more ambitious than it ended up being good but I always think that Doctor Who has room to shoot above its means. In fact I am also not bothered with where they have taken the character either. Her echoes already showed that she was a bit of a control freak and an imposing character. They also expressed her dual life nature. She was a human-Dalek. She was a barmaid-governess. She was a companion-mystery.

&gt; Her mood swings are completely understandable in her situation based on the dual nature of her existence. She goes back and forth between seeing wonders and beauty and seeing horrible evil. One minute she is talking to her boyfriend and the next she is traveling to a planet of shrubs. As she said, adventuring can be seen like an addiction. Even if you are scorned by the drug of choice, all you want is that next high. And although she feels like the Doctor let her down in Kill the Moon, she still feels like he needs her and that despite the way she sees his actions he is still trying to be the good man that she has come to know and love. 

&gt; And in the words of the Fourth Doctor: Well, of course I'm being childish! There's no point being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes.

Now to address your questions:

**Personally my idea of the role of the companion is to be just that a companion. I don't care what function or purpose they serve other than that. If the companions served the exact same purpose each time, the characters would get pretty flat for most people real fast.** This might be why I have so far never really had a problem with any companion. I don't think they need to perfect nor imperfect. I don't care if they are human or alien (although I would like them to have some alien companions again). I don't care if they are there for a whole episode or just part. I don't care if they save the day or cause it to fall. I don't care if they are annoying or enthralling. In fact I don't care if they sit an episode or disappear for an episode or two. I don't care if the Doctor loves them or if they love the Doctor. I don't care if they are grounded or have their heads in the clouds.

**All I care is that they are traveling with the Doctor for whatever purpose or reason they are** and that the end of the day they come back to the TARDIS for another adventure or at least are included in an adventure when they are next visited.

Sometimes the companion should function as:

* a foil (One/Ian/Barbara)
* a BFF (Two/Jamie)
* a coworker/friend (Three/Brigadier)
* an equal or near to it (Four/Romana)
* even a semi-antagonist (Five/Turlough)
* a transformative influence (Six/Evelyn)
* a surrogate daughter/pupil (Seven/Ace)
* an initial guardian/charge (Eight/Lucie)
* a reinvigorator (Nine/Rose)
* a potential lover (Ten/Rose) 
* a wife (Eleven/River)
* an unsure companion of a former Doctor (Twelve/Clara).
* and I could really go on and on for each Doctor

Almost every companion has been different from every other even if those differences are more subtle than apparent. The one thing that ties them altogether is the Doctor and that really is the only thing that needs to tie them together. There should never be a companion template. And although some people like to say their has been with Mickey/Rory/Danny or Susan/Vicki/Dodo but if you really look into their characters, actions, and backgrounds there is actually a lot more that separates them than brings them together.

This is not to say that I don't think that there were certain companions that didn't work or had poor scripts or characterization, far from it. I just think that for Doctor Who to feel like a real show there has to be experimentation with characters which means sometimes things will miss the mark, but I would never really fault the character we see on screen for that. I always try to see the companions as what they were in their best episodes. Poor episodes will also likely suffer from poor characterization but even then what one person sees as poor characterization another person sees as character dynamism or advancement.",0,1413333195,null,0,false,0,cl9otyt,t3_2j8tyh,t1_cl9otyt,t3_2j8tyh,null,1426524564,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

You also then have to take into account the Lib Dems, who the Greens have at points equalled in polling numbers and beaten in quite a few by-elections.  Plus polls are not 100% reliable.

You can certainly make arguments for why UKIP and the Lib Dems should be included in debates, but it's hard to explain why you would include both and not the Greens without changing the goalposts for each.

If it's by polls or by-election results, you would include UKIP but not the Lib Dems or the Greens.

If it's by number of MPs you would either include or exclude both UKIP and the Greens.

If it's by past involvement in government you would include the Lib Dems but not the Greens or UKIP.

You'd have to keep shifting the metrics to keep out the Greens.

I'm not sure that's true - especially considering that the 'people in charge' hold a range of political views.

&gt;

&gt;The __Time War__, more specifically called __The Last Great Time War__, is a conflict within the fictional [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoniverse) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. The conflict pitted the [Time Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) against the [Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) and culminated in the apparent mutual destruction of both races, caused by [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)).

&gt;In the *Doctor Who* continuity, the war occurs between the events of the [1996 film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film\)) and the [2005 revived series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_1\)). It was frequently mentioned and alluded to from the first series of the show's return, but was not directly seen until the show's 50th anniversary special. The war's events and progression have never been fully explained. Short comments in various episodes act as hints, but the war was not thoroughly talked about until the [2007 series finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_of_the_Time_Lords); the two-part special *[The End of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Time)* (2009) provided further information and revealed the Time Lord leaders' sinister endgame. The closing battles and the climax of the Time War were finally depicted in the 50th anniversary special ""[The Day of the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor)"" which ultimately revealed the Time Lords' fate.

It's true I don't like him, but if I felt we could depend on him I wouldn't let my dislike cloud my judgement. He goes missing in games, and you never really know what you're going to get with him.

There's a reason a striker with seemingly all the talent in the world was let go by Arsenal, City, and not kept by Madrid.

As to your last point, (and I'm going to sound like a cold hearted asshole here) what he's gone through is shitty, no doubt. But if you or I had been through the same thing and weren't performing at our jobs, I dare say we'd have been ""let go"" by now.

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I'd be interested in reading about the differences in assimilation models. I've always wondered a little why American immigrants are often so proud of their assimilation yet British immigrants are often accused of not assimilating enough. You (and presumably academics who've written about this) have really hit the nail on the head. To become a citizen here you have to pass the Life in the UK test about British cultural life. Why exactly it's necessary to know British idioms and odd British customs before you are allowed to be a citizen I don't know but apparently it's essential. It seems more essential to me that immigrants be encouraged to adopt liberal values like individual freedom, civil liberties and tolerance and crucially that they supersede but don't replace cultural differences. You can still practice your religion, wear what you want and speak whatever language you want as long as you don't interfere with people's individual rights. 

If British people were actually confident in a civic conception of Britishness and they knew for sure that all long term immigrants had accepted that same conception as part of their process of settling in the country then I think people would be so much more able to look past cultural differences because they would believe there was similarity underneath. Instead if you based people's concept of Britishness on the Anglican church, cricket and pub banter then your basically making it 1000 times harder for immigrants to appear assimilated because they just haven't had the same cultural moulding (and they may not want it). In a way you're creating a self-fulfilling prophesy where you've made it incredibly hard for immigrants to assimilate according to local standards thus causing friction.

Most of the effort in designing a truly *good* test is making each of the individual criteria produce a good split of the population.  But a good split is not necessary as long as there is *some* split, and other criteria cover the granularity.  In the case of the Bechdel test, the splits are often 90/10% - but the key is that all of them must be passed for a pass mark on the test.  That leaves us with an appreciable (statistically sound) population of passes and fails.

&gt;The [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans) is an area of southeastern Europe situated at a major crossroads between mainland Europe and the [Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East). The distinct identity and fragmentation of the Balkans owes much to its common and often violent history and to its very mountainous geography.

false,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"&gt; Instead if you based people's concept of Britishness on the Anglican church, cricket and pub banter then your basically making it 1000 times harder for immigrants to appear assimilated because they just haven't had the same cultural moulding (and they may not want it). In a way you're creating a self-fulfilling prophesy where you've made it incredibly hard for immigrants to assimilate according to local standards thus causing friction. 

It's exactly this, and I think Europe in general has a really tough time with that. For example, think about all the values and cultural markers you associate with 'Britishness' and you'll see why it's so hard to pin down. New immigrants (excluding myself from this) might see certain things as worth championing: the NHS, Britain's colonial history in some cases, a history of economic conservatism and entrepreneurship; honestly, I'd say one of the more unifying things would be the citizenship pledge to bear faithful allegiance to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors. Like it or not, the country's relationship with the monarchy is one of the main things people think of internationally when they think of the UK.

But then there are other things that most in Britain wouldn't appreciate might constitute barriers. British humour is rightly regarded as very witty and observant, and steeped with sarcasm, but turn on most popular panel shows and you'll get an endless stream of things most foreigners would never know anything about: sixty-eight Kerry Katona references, the odd throwback to a particularly dull member of Thatcher's cabinet, that one time Preston walked out of *Buzzcocks*, a million jokes about Noel Edmonds, jokes that require a specific knowledge of the Geordie accent, references to PE kits or RE lessons or supply teachers (or school assemblies, nativity plays, ways to exploit loopholes in uniform rules, how much X used to cost and how getting rid of shillings made everything more expensive)  and other cultural tropes and stereotypes that would be without comparison in many other places.

One of the issues I see across Europe, and one of the reasons I support EU integration, is simply this: European nations *are defined by their interactions with each other*; Germany wouldn't be Germany without France being France and the UK being the UK. They are all the sum total of their shared histories which have drawn them together and also solidified differences between them. How could Britain exist without France having also existed to make Britain the Anglican, monarchist, French-influenced English-speaking country it is today? As a result, entering a European country as an outsider (particularly one from outside North America/Australia) is like choosing to support a team in a sport you just got interested in - you have no idea what sort of rivalries you're registering for because you like Team X and that's all there is to it, without knowing why they suffered an agonising defeat back in 1973, who their best players were, what slang they use to refer to each other and their opponents, and so on. You can enjoy Britain, but it can be hard to throw yourself head first into a culture you don't quite understand - as far as you're concerned, France is that nice country to the south with good food and some nice museums and beaches. This strange 'to hell with the frogs' rivalry is something both unexplained and unexpected. Why continue to make jokes at the expense of Germany about the war? Someone from China would see Germany largely as it exists today; an industrial powerhouse with a reputation for efficiency and clean cities. Constant mentions of the World Cup defeat in 1966 don't mean a whole lot to you because you don't care about England's supposed rivalry, and thus can't really truly comprehend the history that motivates the people.

This is true throughout Europe, especially due to its relatively recent history of conflict. Immigrants across the continent can (and most do) admire their new countries for what they are and what they see around them *at the time*. However, having not grown up there, with parents passing down the received wisdom of previous generations, cultural tropes lose their meaning. With America, however, it doesn't matter. If you can recite the pledge of allegiance, fly the flag, set off fireworks on the Fourth of July, and believe that hard work will pay off, you're just about set as far as assimilation goes. Here's an analogy: let's say you're British, but you've never been to church before. You know the people there, you can understand the language they're speaking (sort of), but you've been given two books and you've no idea what to do with them. People turn to you and say ""peace be with you"" and you're not sure if you're meant to respond to that or not. You understand the concepts of Christianity, but the pageantry and rituals that accompany that are a foreign world. That's what it's like for most immigrants in Europe.

Another difference is that the US has long pursued (to varying degrees) a model of cultural assimilation helped largely by the hegemony of American mass media, whereas Europe has, for the last several decades, tried to adhere to a more 'multicultural' model of integration (although in fairness, so has Canada). There's been some furore recently with a few politicians in the UK saying that multiculturalism has failed, inevitably followed by accusations of racism. I think it's pragmatic - values and shared identities in Europe are much more closely intertwined with the majority group in each country (race, religion, linguistic community) than in North America, and under that guise it's hard to imagine 'others' ever truly fitting in. 

However, in my own opinion, trying to somehow force new cultural focal points to be inserted into the national curriculum in the vague hope that future generations will embrace icons and ideas over race or language is a bit naive to me, but frankly I see little other choice. To me, the only way Europe will ever truly move beyond its immigrant morass of difficult-to-penetrate cultural isms is if a more empowered European Union naturally leads to the organic formation of a new pan-European identity. And I say that without a hint of irony. Several people have already spoken of the long-lasting effects of Erasmus on programme participants. Apologies for linking to The Guardian, but I love Umberto Eco and [this is a nice piece](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/26/umberto-eco-culture-war-europa). It's often not appreciated in the UK, but the great irony in all this is that Britain is culturally far more similar to the rest of Europe than it is to the US, both in terms of shared history, modern values and common interests. 

I think it's vital that immigrants (to the UK or anywhere else) do their best to understand the laws, basic values, history and language of their new country, and to that end I don't completely oppose the Life in the UK test. Sure, I think the history in it is questionable, the questions sometimes absurdly pointless, but the concept itself isn't objectionable and most other countries have similar such tests. However, it'll only be by throwing off the vestiges of centuries of inter-European conflict, the stereotypes that follow, and focussing more towards the future (and each other) that European countries will be able to overcome this obstacle. Until then, an Indian living in Denmark will continue to not really care why people find jokes about Swedes so funny, or a Kenyan man in Spain will continue to not give a shit about Spain's often tense relations with the UK surrounding Gibraltar and the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.",0,1413343650,null,0,false,0,cl9tvd8,t3_2j80cj,t1_cl9tvd8,t1_cl9rym7,null,1426522119,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;The only serious black mark against the NHS was its poor record on keeping people alive. On a composite ""healthy lives"" score, which includes deaths among infants and patients who would have survived had they received timely and effective healthcare, the UK came 10th.

The second link you added with your edit.


&gt;* Although cancer survival rates have improved, international comparisons show we still **lag behind other countries in survival rates for several types of cancer.**
* While infant mortality has fallen, recent analysis published by the British Medical Journal suggests that **UK child mortality rates are higher than in many other European countries.**
* Support for people with long-term conditions is inconsistent and people continue to be admitted to hospital for conditions that could be managed in the community.
* **Variations in the quality** of general practice and in the treatment provided in hospitals **remain persistent and widespread**

Both of those links are from British sources. They are British people saying that Britain is the best in the world and and they *still* say things like what I quote above, even though the bias they admit there are problems, yet people in this subreddit seem unable to. I've never seen a public healthcare system fetishesed as much as the NHS is, in the media, by normal people in everyday conservation, by people online.

The 'Commonwealth Fund' report you're linking to show the NHS is the best also ranked outcomes poorly.

Your second link says things like

&gt;According to the 2011 British Social Attitudes Survey, 64 per cent of people are satisfied with the NHS

Brits are satisfied with the NHS, it's great, they're the ones who have to use it.

Britain (and much of Europe) has lost out on globalisation and this country lacks affordable housing and decent jobs for young people. Young people from other countries benefited in learning other languages when they were young whereas many Brits only speak one language and therefore lose out on the benefits of freedom of movement, only seeing it as an avenue for more foreign competition. There has been a lengthy recession and the government is wildly out of touch and elitist. If someone charismatic can point the finger and give them a scapegoat these desparate people will take one and it looks as though they have. This is a common cliche in history that repeats itself every time these conditions arise.

So in general I would say that most Brits are not hostile towards us and that this is a decent multicultural society and a nice place to live. The constant media barrage of UKIP and anti immigrant headlines makes the problem of hostility much worse than it is.

Wrong. You can still look at them. Call her a cunt.

false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Now, I have to ask, (and there may be a reason - I am asking for interest not as a challenge) What does a ""hippy Leftie"" see in UKIP?

Ok, firstly let me invite you to read over **[this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2j1czs/how_noticeable_it_is_that_ukip_is_setting_the/cl7m5r7)**.  It was a response to a question about how UKIP are setting the agenda.

Toward the end of that I referred to The Broken Compass/ **[The Cameron Delusion](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Cameron-Delusion-Peter-Hitchens/dp/1441135057)** by Peter Hitchens.

Summarising Hitchens' argument in an extreme way gives you something like this:    
a.  Socialism is bad.  Not even just BAD.  Socialism is **BAD**!    
b.  The Labour party has a socialist plan that requires several decades in power.    
c.  The Conservative party is complicit in helping the evil socialist plan.    
d.  When the Conservatives are in power they deliberately don't roll back the evil socialism.    
e.  This allows the Left to roll out their evil plan in stages while the Right *pretends* to oppose it.    
f.  The Conservatives should be kept out of power until they're forced to reform and stop supporting this nonsense.

Hitchens is not, in my opinion, a good writer.  He **is**, however, a compelling writer.  I disagree with him almost diametrically on the conclusion he draws, but I do agree with a lot of the problems he identified getting to it.

How I see it is that:    
a.  There is no actual conspiracy.  Just short-termism, self-interest, stupidity and greed.    
b.  The Left has become infected with the policies and attitudes of the Right.

*(In the post I linked I explained the rush for the political Centre:  Blair was so successful in leading his party in a huge lurch to the Right that playing the middle of the road became the only game in town.)*

To quote **[George Galloway ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvrt6Nq3Sc8#t=46)**, ""I care nothing for the Conservatives of the Liberal Democrats.  I wish them political perdition.  But I do care about the Labour party [...] and I want to [...] appeal to the Labour party to turn away and break decisively from the path of treason set for them by Tony Blair almost twenty years ago and from which they have not properly resiled.  They must stop taking their supporters for granted.  They must stop imagining that working people and poor people have no option but to support them[...]""

Quick detour:  I sometimes read books in pairs.  I bought The Cameron Delusion and **[Chavs:  The demonisation of the working class](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chavs-Demonization-Working-Owen-Jones/dp/1844678644/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413356621&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=chavs)** at the same time.  This is an interesting counterbalance to Hitchens, but much more to the point it's a reminder than the shitting on the working class is **not** the exclusive entertainment of the Right.

One more thing to cover quickly:  Blair dragged Labour to *The Centre*  If you imagine it like a ruler with Labour and the Conservatives starting at the ends this moves them to literally around the centre.  *(50cm'ish.)*  The Conservatives followed suit under Cameron, but the Centre is now somewhere in the region of 70-80cm.  It's not impossible that people from the Right might not see it that way, but that's how it seems to me.

OK, I think that'll do for what I think is wrong with the Left:    
a.  Huge lurch to the Right.    
b.  Assumption that they're entitled to the support of the poor and the working class.    
c.  Comprehensive failure to represent the poor and the working class.    

Setting aside Hitchens' conspiracy theory where I do agree with him is that you best influence your politicians by punishing them when they behave badly.  This is where, ""You MUST vote Conservative or Labour or you waste your vote!"" serves us terribly. It means they can treat you like shit and you have to take it.

OK, a second detour:  Anatol Rapoport proposed a game theory algorithm he called **[Tit For Tat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat)**.  More or less this is, ""Cooperate until the other player betrays you.  Then punish them until they resume cooperation.""  Or:  Every time you screw me over I will slap you until you quit it.

Aside from the fact that five year electoral cycles are a problem, I think this is a good way to handle politicians.  They're not inherently valuable.  They're not important or special. They are supposed to work **for** us.  There're conflicts of interest in that, but that **is** what they're for.  

*(Having to rush a little now, need to leave for work soon.)*

UKIP are eating support from the Conservatives.  This forces the Conservative party to reconfigure to acknowledge its Right wing support.  I don't agree with those people, but I **do** think their party ought to represent them and to stop assuming entitlement to their support.

The utter neglect of and spite toward the poor and the working class from Labour means that a lot of those people are considering voting UKIP.  They might be misguided in doing so, but you're not going to argue that it's not going to happen.

This means that UKIP support influences both the Conservatives and Labour.  Better yet, they leverage both sides, which means larger numbers, which means more influence.

It's laughable to even think that PLA could come to the negotiating table after they just had even more of their land stolen, and expect Netanyahu to offer them a just deal. 

When the Lukid base believes that they are divinely entitled to the land that the Palestinians live on, what would be their incentive to offer a piece deal? They already control of all of the West bank! They collect taxes on the behalf of the PLA, they can impose Israeli law on anyone living on 'Palestinian' land. They are already pretty much subjects of Israeli control. It's a pretty sweet deal for Israel. The only thing that could possibly change this course is outside influence or a change in leadership within the Knesset.

false,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;In what way, and how - for example - does that compare to a fast food restaurant or building a housing block. You must provide some context. And not USA context - British context. For example the wastewater regimes in the UK are completely different to those in the US.

It's not possible to provide a British context because there isn't one yet, we don't have the experience of fracking.  However, we can certainly look at the experience of the US and Australia, for example, and see numerous examples of air/soil/water pollution, some of them extremely serious and for which landowners and local communities have won legal actions and reached large out of court settlements.

&gt;That is completely untrue. ""Gasland"" was a fraudulent documentary. 

No it isn't.  Whilst there were alleged rebuttals to many of the arguments in Gasland (many contained in industry-sponsored PR ""movies""), there are also many rebuttals to these ""rebuttals"".  On the case in point, whilst it's true that Gasland definitely overdid and overplayed the setting the taps on fire thing (and you can see why, because it's dramatic propaganda), nonetheless, since baseline data has begun to be collected abut methane levels in land around fracking pads, scientific evidence has shown in many instances this can increase markedly.  So even though burning water isn't _necessarily_ attributable to fracking activity, it can be, and it can be made worse.

&gt;All sorts of things have happened in the USA but that is an entirely different regulatory and legal system. 

So we're told, but the industry has a track record of sidestepping all sorts of regulation and legislation, it uses small shell companies and partnerships to ensure there is no one to sue/prosecute when things go seriously wrong and the cleanup and consequences fall on taxpayers and the community.  The British State, government, so-called regulatory oufits, BGS, NGOs etc. are riddled with industry place men and women, making them poorly placed to act as neutral sources, arbiters, regulators.  Actions the government has taken or threatened to take so far, from removing local democracy, through passing legislation to give the industry carte blanche to use any sort of fracking fluids, to providing endless subsidies, don't exactly inspire confidence that they intend to be even handed about this.  It's a done deal as fa as they're concerned, and to hell with the consequences.

&gt;The industry says that gas prices will come down as a result of fracking.

The government claims that, but the industry's top guy in the UK [says not](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/29/browne-fracking-not-reduce-uk-gas-prices-shale-energy-bills).

&gt;Your argument is that you think that I think that the job pays a certain level and so we should not create those jobs? 

I think that when an industry's PR machine talks about creating X number of jobs, it's fair to ask what sort of jobs.  Given the levels of subsidy as well as private money which are being poured into the industry, it's fair to ask if we'd bet a better return on better, more useful and more sustainable jobs elsewhere.

&gt;You keep talking about the USA. I dismiss that argument as not relevant. 

Then you are a fool, because the UK experience will likely be the same as if not worse that theirs (because of issues like geology and population density).  Your much vaunted protections and regulations will be brushed aside as the industry begins to push the envelope once their exploratory fracks expand.

&gt;And how, precisely, do you imagine a building site significantly increasing local crime? 

I think in this instance perhaps, the US experience is unlikely to be replicated since we don't have the distances and isolation, but there they have large camps of mostly male workers, living in poorly thought out conditions, doing danger and dirty work with high mortality/morbidity rates, which has in turn led to significantly higher antisocial and violent crime rates in rural areas with historically low rates of crime (up to and including rapes and murders).",0,1413360624,null,0,1413361098,0,cl9yxzl,t3_2j738i,t1_cl9yxzl,t1_cl9kxu7,null,1426519682,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

With every wave of immigration (which I see as positive and natural process) these issues have been raised; it is over time that many if not most people integrate and these become non-issues.


But that is not to say we don't have to resolve eg housing, over utilization of public infrastructure (schools, hospitals). If immigrants are genuinely breaking rules, they should be penalised and we will make a better set of rules.

I would even concede, **if the evidence** shows it as such we should manage immigration more strictly - but I would request that we start from point that immigration is positive and then go on from there. We should be honest about any problems that an influx of people has but then also note that immigrants pay more into the system than they take. (The statistics matter and they may paint a different picture to the one you believe).

Google 'OPTIC NERVE GCHQ'.  GCHQ , with help from NSA, collected mass images of Yahoo webcam users. Not targeted individuals with a warrant but unselected, mass bulk collection of private innocent individuals in their own home. 

A ""Surprising"" (surprising to who exactly!?!) Number of these images (if I recall 7-10%) contained nudity. I would say its very safe to assume a lot of these are horny children/teenagers 

The government has literally collected mass images of innocent people, millions of them, in their own home with lots being naked. If this doesn't anger you, if this doesn't show you the contempt Governments have for basic rights (in this case privacy) then I don't know what to say to you. The hilarious irony in all of this is the Government spouts the usual bullshit ""Think of the children"" to justify such draconian programs while mass collecting naked images of children. 


Another ""funny"" thing about all this is If you have had privacy debates before you have probably seen the common hyperbolic argument to absurdity ""You wouldn't want a CCTV in your home"" argument to prove a point. The fact that this supposed hyperbole is actually fairly close to reality just shows the absurdity of it all.

Where did I make such an allegation?

In fact, their views are probably more aligned with the government's own than those of the population at large, which is generally more critical of Israel and more pro Palestinian.

&gt;Stating that a MP is likely to vote against Palestine because they're Jewish

I never said that at all, I have no idea where you're getting it from.  I didn't even appreciate s/he _was_ Jewish (without looking, I can't even remember what gender s/he was!)  And I _don't_ have any data on whether Jewish people generally are more pro Israel and less pro Palestine, I certainly know many of even my Israeli let alone my Jewish anarchist and left wing friends and colleagues are highly critical of their government and some would favour a Palestinian State (albeit not the anarchists for obvious reasons!), so I'm certainly not claiming such views are in any way universal.

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. (See above for those figures)

Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured (they were measured once in Apr-Jun 2014 at 2% of employment or 1.0% of full time and 4.9% of part time), however there is some regular measure of “underemployment”  by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures) 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. (See above for these figures)

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a margin of error, e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

this is a red herring. many even most recognise that immigration is good - and want to continue welcoming productive &amp; skilled people into the country (albeit we need to control absolute numbers to manage problems like the housing shortage). the issue is that there is a proportion of immigration that is unskilled, and unproductive. These are the type of immigrants that we want to avoid - as they cost more than they produce and create problems with employment and low skilled wages.

I think we're **way** overdue some sort of intelligent discussion about immigration in the UK. We hadn't had it mainly because *(and the Left are predominantly guilty here)* as soon as anyone voices reservation about it they get shouted down as a filthy, ignorant, racist piece of shit.

Going right back to the start this is part of why UKIP attracts disproportionately more nutters. You're going to be accused of racism and this will disattract many moderates.

It is a fact that we have more people who need work than jobs for them. It's not even a small amount, it's millions of jobs. When you see figures that show immigrants are a net benefit they don't address the fact that unless a new job is created that's an extra job not available. That means another under-employed person. 

This isn't fancy economics, or political theory. It's primary school mathematics. High unemployment is great for capitalism, it drives wages down and we live in a country where when Asda advertise jobs the number of applicants are in the dozens per job.

European border policies mean there is no intra-community border control. The Conservatives and Labour promising again and again that they would fix immigration tightened the rules they could again and again and again past it being a farce. Go look at a forum for people with foreign spouses (I bet reddit has one) and see how hard it is for an American to come live here.

Most of all, to act as a bridge between the alien Doctor and us Humans. Add to that, apparently, (according to canon) Humans act as a Moral Guide, inspiring the Doctor to be his best self. And, a Companion acts as, well, a companion  - even Time Lords seem to get lonely. The Doctor does appreciate the company of Humans, even if we are inferior pudding-brains. Lastly, and least important, sometimes it's helpful to have someone to pitch in - Companion as assistant.

As to the Companions' importance to the stories and Seasons, IMO, they should be secondary to the Doctor. This show is, after all, called ""Doctor Who"" - it's about the alien from Gallifrey who calls himself the Doctor. 

Yes, Season 8 has been too much about Clara and not nearly enough about our newly-regenerated Doctor.

More Companion ramblings follow, proceed if you wish...

I didn't like Clara as Companion in Season 7 for the simple reason that it was disturbing, wrong, and sad to see the Doctor with a Companion he couldn't trust.

Shortly after Clara seemed trustworthy and on the Doctor's side, the Regeneration happened, and since then Clara has been a poor Companion - in ways too numerous to go into here.

Please, no, a Companion is not to be a proxy for the viewer. Whovians are such a demographically diverse bunch that makes no sense. We are even geographically diverse now! It's just not doable to have a Companion who represents us.

There will of course be several reasons why abuse on such a large scale was able to go on for so long. The police and local government failings are two major factors. 

But in the end, who is really responsible for these crimes? The blame must fall largely on the men that committed them, and in order to prevent them from happening again in the future we must understand why these men do what they do. 

It is becoming increasingly difficult to deny that there is a problem within some parts of Pakistani culture in this country. Rotherham, Birmingham, Oxford, Bradford, Sheffield, and now Manchester have all had major cases of widespread child abuse taking place involving Pakistani men.     

However, this element of the problem is almost never discussed, by the police, politicians or the media.

Concerns about the 'feral' behaviour of 'the great unwashed' have been around for a long time. The problem was made more visible and concentrated by industrialisation, but I reckon that non-aristocratic children have pretty much always been like this or worse. Ever read Oliver Twist? At least the kids on your street aren't professional pickpockets and muggers. At least they aren't carrying blackjacks and knives and routinely prowl dark streets knocking people out.

The question isn't ""why are things getting worse"", the question is ""why is a period of relative calm coming to an end? Why are we going backwards?""

Punishment doesn't work. We've tried taking these kids from their parents, corporal punishment, putting them in workhouses, imprisoning them in borstals, we've even got an unsavoury history of sterilising undesirables. It breeds resentment and makes for fucked up, traumatised adults. It's exactly those sorts of psychological wounds that fucks people up enough to neglect their children and reject the moral codes of wider society.

&gt; I'd stop short of saying sterilise the lot of them, but only a fraction short.

Careful with this eugenicist urge of yours. Unless you've got an aristocratic lineage, chances are you're descended from kids just like this. You ended up being fine: you're clearly a fully socialised, well adapted, caring and educated individual. You probably had loving parents and grandparents, and other people who showed a compassionate interest in your development. The thing that breaks the cycle - absurd and sentimental as it sounds - is love and compassion.

I'm not saying go out and hug a hoodie - let's be frank, you'd probably get your phone nicked if you tried - I'm saying that this is a societal problem that can only be solved by society, by making changes in our culture and outlook. We need to make sure these kids are well looked after and cared for, to give them a fighting chance to pass on positive values to their own kids.

Production from a  shale gas well is still governed by darcy's law* which is why you see the high initial production followed by the rapid decline  as the gas in the shale has to move from further and further in the matrix into the fracture.  But its also why theoretically you should see it stabilize and have a long tail of low but very stable production that hardly declines much like CBM wells though their initial production is different.  

The last three pages of this [document](http://water.epa.gov/type/groundwater/uic/class2/hydraulicfracturing/upload/flowofgasandwaterinhfshalegasreservoirs.pdf) explains it a bit better.

you are correct in that gas is absorbed in the shale as well but is still requires a flow path for it to reach the fracture. Likewise i believe something like 70% of the initial production comes from the free gases present in the shale rather than the absorbed gas. But not 100% on that 70% number.

Not really. We have wage and pricing laws in order to manage the economy. Minimum wages are set up so that legal workers are guaranteed a certain standard of living; otherwise the very poorest would be living in tents, shitting in buckets and working 18-hour shifts to survive.

Some illegal workers *do* live in appalling conditions; I hear that many vegetable pickers are Eastern Europeans paid a pittance. That work should be stamped down on, forcing all employers to obey the laws. 

Once they do, the capitalist economic system adjusts and a new baseline for competition establishes itself. 

Competition *does* dictate wages and prices, but when some employers get away with illegal practices, you may have to break the law to compete.

The best (and only) solution to this problem is sterilisation; go round all the shitty housing estates where the chavs are and sterilise both the chavs *and* their parents.  This will prevent people of low birth from breeding and ruining Britain in the future.

Let's face it, such people don't really contribute much to Britain anyway; they use up our resources more than any other group.  They cost the NHS a fortune with their drinking and smoking.  They cost councils a fortune for the damage they do through vandalism and graffiti.  They cost a fortune in policing and legal costs.  They cost a fortune in welfare because they do nothing but breed more numpties, who will, in turn, replicate the problems of their parents.  And they cost a fortune for our prisons because this is where many of them end up.  

So the most humane thing to do with society's undesirables is to sterilise them.  We also need to encourage the better educated and wealthier people of Britain to have more children.

and then I got to page 24 - which has (at first glance) the most misleading pyramid graph of all time.  It's not until I took a quantity of time to read all the axis (which yes you should always do...) and then only read the percentages that you realize just how horrible the situation is.

Percentage of population - Percentage of Wealth




Population | Wealth
---|---
0.7% | 44.0%
7.9% | 41.3%
21.5% | 11.8%
69.8% | 2.9%

Now lets just put that into what I think is a far better graph... infact lets have 4 of them!
http://i.imgur.com/g69McHf.png

Edit: [this graph showing UK Wealth data](http://i.imgur.com/qqGNt16.jpg) by [lionmoose] (http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2javlt/britain_is_the_only_g7_country_with_rise_in/cla0ckq) is far better than my two left hand graphs at giving an idea of this

I especially like the top left one...

Edit:

To include some actual figures from the graph:-

Wealth Per Person (I know it's not divided like this but heyho..)

Top|.
---|---
0.7% of population|35m people
44.0% of wealth | 115.9t USD
WPP|$3,285,714


Bottom|.
---|---
69.8% of population|3,282m
2.9% of wealth|$7.6t USD 
WPP|$0.0004318421

0.0004318421 * 10,000,000,000 to get to $4,318,421, yes you have to multiply the wealth of the bottom person 10 BILLION TIMES to get into the same ball park as the most wealthy.  How is it okay to be worth 10billion times someone else?

What the actual fuck and that is using averages.  Can I get off this ride please its fucking depressing.

More people are employed for wages which provide less money than they need to exist.  Costing the tax payer huge amounts in subsidies and welfare which cost should be coming from employers paying people living wages instead of reaping their productivity for profit.

Not to mention the mental health damage of being in poverty. We are rapidly approaching a whole lost generation (or several) which will have no real wealth well into there 40's - who are then expected to purchase housing which has been vastly inflated and who will have no capital to do so, so when they retire they have no capital to pay for retirement...

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated that in 2005 there was 13.1 million British Nationals living abroad. I have a strong feeling that their definition of a British National is something very broad, though.

The 2001 UK census said the foreign born population inside the UK was 4.9million and by 2011 this rose to 7.5million. I guess that means there could have been a year between 2001 and 2011 where the statement was correct but it's not correct anymore. Otherwise I reckon they used the Foreign and Commonwealth Offices stats which are obviously accurate but, in my eyes, use a far to broad definition to determine whether or not a person is 'British'.

Smoking tends not to have such extremes.  I can't think of an environment where I would want my children to see role models smoking.  As alcohol is enjoyed by many in moderation, I would rather them see this, learn that it is better to not drink to excess, by example.

Non-the-less I will answer your question and just get another account after I get too many down-votes. 

ok..

Guess what? the kids are bored.
Discipline maybe a good point, but that doesn't stop the problem in my opinion.

I recently lived in another country. I won;t say which one.
The council there new that kids like to mess around with cars and bikes. so guess what? they built a racing track on wasteland, and allowed the kids to fuck around with it. even drive cars and bikes around it. The only catch was that they were responsible for any injuries, and also responsible for their own safety.
I should mention at this point however that free healthcare was NOT available in this country.

The parents took it upon themselves to warn their kids about it. this deterred some kids, but not others.

most of the cars and stuff that were their were old rust buckets, but i suppose the kids had fun.

The police turned a blind eye to it, and checked up on them every now and again (to check for stolen vehicles and any other stolen property).

as it happens the crime rate went right down in the area. (alcohol was easy to get in the local shops (even though it was against the law), but all these kids congregated around this waste land, and absolutely no one had a problem with it.

I have no idea of there were any injuries, but this was a country where you were expected to look after yourself, and learn common sense.

I heard a rumour from someone that there was a guy who taught the kids mechanics on certain days, but i'm unsure about this fact as it was difficult to get the whole story (I was translating a non english language)


the problem is, that this is almost impossible to do in England.
the nanny state has got so self-righteous that trying something other than distributing criminal records at the drop of a hat, is a complete no-go, and considered ""un-speakable"".

the problem is not the kids, the problem is our own mentality, local council policy, and central government policy.

We (as the adults) are the problem and we don't ever listen to what children want. we get into this idea that we know best.. but the truth be known... we don't.

Instead of bombarding kids with more stress and pressure (which they reject)... let them have their free-for-all... and them we'll start with education.

The problem, also is that no-one respects England now. I dare say the OP doesn't either. you only respect your own life, or house, the same as everyone else. I blame the government for it. I think most politicians just look after their own bank account and have no interest in England at all. I also think that the government has fucked up so badly, that most, if not all of the population has given up.

false,joeflux,null,null,"&gt; Why do you think restricted borders are a good thing?

Just to state up front - my own wife is an immigrant in the UK, and I'm an immigrant in her country.  (We move back and forth).

If you have a small number of immigrants, then the immigrants tend to disperse around the cities, get non-immigrant friends, go to non-immigrant schools and communities.  Within a generation they are integrated and they mostly take on western morals.  I have absolutely no problem with this.

You occasionally get problems with difference in values - such as honour killings etc, but by selecting for skilled immigrants etc, you can mostly 

However as you increase the number of immigrants, what you get is clumping.  Where I grew up in London is now 60% immigrants.  If you focus on only 40 year olds and under, it's closer to 80%.

The result is that we import the third world culture.  We get a rapid increase in Islam.  We get oppression of women, forced marriages, and so on.

You get Muslim-only faith schools.  You get a break down in integration.

What we are seeing is that the next generation of UK Muslims are highly radicalised.

* Do you know that **31%** of British Muslims believe that people who leave Islam should be killed?  This rises to 36% for 16-24 year olds, with an additional 7% who don't know.

* When you ask 18-24 year old UK Muslims about the 7/7 London bombings, 31% agree that they were justified.

* Only 30% of UK Muslims (and 24% for 16-24 year olds ) think that homosexuality should be legal!

* 57% of 16-25 year old UK Muslims think that a woman shouldn't be allowed to get married without consent from her parents.

* 56% believe that Muslims women should not be allowed to marry a non-Muslim man.

Culture issue. People in the UK nowadays believe they have the right to tell other people to stop smoking whenever and however they like, with absolute certainty that they'll be backed up by similiarly small-minded wankers. 

I tend to try and have a degree of consideration for non-smokers. But I'm not going to subject myself to total servitude just so they can feel slightly less put out by what amounts to a trivial inconvenience. 

Funny how British people find it so much worse than say, the French or Italians or Spanish. I wonder if the issue is more to do with non-smokers in the UK than any real problem actually existing in the first place.

*(First lesson free, further lessons £9.99):*

""I slept with your mother"".

* The ultimate beginner bantersaurus phrase- an oldie but a goodie, renowned for its versatility and recognition. It's a sign that you're cool with the ""mad bantz"" that's going on, and that you want to partake in it.

* The application of this implication is what makes it. It can be fit into banterful conversations in many different ways, and will usually result in at least moderate mirthful reaction.

* At its base, it is a touch childish to just say ""Yeah, well I slept with your mum!"", and this should be avoided if possible- remember, in Bantzville, USA, subtlety is king.

* Implying things without stating them outright is a key component of becoming Bantmaster General. Instead try, for example, ""Well, that's what your mum said last night!"". Everyone understands that you saw their mum last night, and can reach their own conclusion that- shock horror- you were having intercourse with her.

* Although this is a good general phrase to ease your way into the feel of conversation, it it important to note that it should not be used as a crutch. Unlike your mum. Ho ho.

* Be aware of some of the pitfalls of any given statement.

* For example, the other person's mum may be dead, or they may at least try to claim she is. If so, they will almost certainly make that point to try and win back BANTFEST 2014, by making you look an insensitive fool. The common counter to this is not to retreat, but to take the Bantmobile onwards- ""Ah, I wondered why she didn't move much.""

* Consider that they may also have a bad relationship with their mother, in which case this may not be an appropriate form of bAnTz- it may be considered bad taste, especially if this is common knowledge in the group you are in. No banter is infallible.

* Of course, subversion is also possible and encouraged- try experimenting with substituting ""mum"" for ""dad"" or ""nan"", but be aware of any implications this may have on yourself, as you are now suggesting you slept with their father or grandmother. However, with higher risk comes higher reward, and the reaction, if successfully pulled off, will be more satisfying and triumphant.

are these items *as an industry* failing to generate tax? answer is no. 

&gt;If I grow a carrot rather than buy one, yes it's failing to generate tax revenue. That's kind of a no-brainer.

&gt; If I grow cannabis at home and don't buy it over the counter at Tesco's - that too will not generate tax revenue and the cost of the equipment may or may not be worth it in the long run (I don't know the costs of purchasing and using such equipment, sadly).

And despite those things being true, people in spend vastly more money on taxed alcohol rather than home brewed. its not even cheaper to grow your own carrots or tomatoes due to economies of scale - so again people buy taxed retail versions.

so the fact that you can grow it yourself has no practical impact on the fact that cannabis would be a successfully taxed industry just like tobacco and alcohol.

We've lost sight of the purpose of politics and democracy in this country - there are 60 million people and each one of us wants a different world to live in, we need to use the processes that we have to make the country work for everyone. As I see it, attacks on people like Russell Brand are the epitome of missing the point of that, they are motivated by defending a status quo, yes some of the things that Brand says are silly but they are no more silly than policies that government ministers propose, they are simply more radical. The message that underlies all these attacks (even if it's not made explicit) is ""politics is for the political class"".  On the specific critique here. voting is not and was never meant to be the only way to engage in the political process. The idea that this is how you make a difference is just dumb, ticking one of (realistically) 2 boxes to decide on how you want every facet of your life to be controlled for the next 5 years and saying that's it, done my part, is madness.

When I look at the statistics in the UK and compare them to other nations I see a country that it's great to live in but which is moving in the wrong direction compared to many of it's peers. I don't think that Brand is right in the methods he proposes but in a functioning democracy he would be a weight pulling the country in a certain direction that broadly favours people over large corporate entities, and to some extent he does that.

However, in the UK in particular when compared to other countries, we have a political system that polarises people around one of two extremes and which doesn't allow for any nuanced conversation. Politics has two parties (Sorry Lib Dems but it does), papers take one of two sides and normal avenues for political activity you find in other countries like strong local government are so weak in the UK that they are essentially governed by the national level politics. Not one person in 50 here would votes for a Labour/Tory local councillor if they were  a Tory/Labour supporter even if they had good ideas that could help out locally. 

There are huge problems with a two party system and the refusal to even respect extremist views. I think that UKIP has arisen in response to this in no small part, they have hijacked frustration with the system we have at the moment and got people supporting something on the grounds that it's different from the norm and under the current system that's the best hope people thin they have of actually changing things. 

A classic example of this was the panic in this country over having a coalition government because it would make the government ""weak"" - that view was in nearly every paper and even reflected in the financial markets but think what that actually means, a government trying to respect the views of the majority of the voting population for the first time in my lifetime is ""weak""!

&gt; No shit. But you're taking a very blinkered view at a larger picture here.

It seems you are as well. Keeping cannabis illegal literally means that all revenues from its purchase (which cant be stopped - see failure of ""War on drugs"") are directly funding criminal activities.

Furthermore, the police wastes large amounts of resources trying to capture the perpetrators of these criminal activities. So you see this loss of revenue is two fold, the initial financing of criminal activities, and then the resources wasted trying to catch the perpetrators.

Add to that the various diseases and disorders (epilepsy, cancer, autism and a myriad of others) where patients can greatly benefit from cannabis use and it seems to me that the outlawing of cannabis was/is an extremely naive and down right illogical manoeuvre.

I'll give you a pass if you don't have kids and therefore have no conception of the protective instinct. If you do have kids and think that way then you are an utter  cunt.
