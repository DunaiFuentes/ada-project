The median household income is the income of what would be the middle household, if all households in the UK were sorted in a list from poorest to richest. As it represents the middle of the income distribution, the median household income provides a good indication of the standard of living of the “typical” household in terms of income.

true,AimHere,null,null,"Well Shetland, historically, has voted against Scottish devolution harder than almost any other region, and there won't be any significant move towards splitting from Scotland, despite the silly referendum-spoiling noises coming from Tavish Scott, the MSP. Shetlanders are a pragmatic bunch and not given to flights of ideological fancy, and despite a bit of very mild antipathy to displays of overt Scottishness, there really isn't going to be any appetite in the Islands for splitting from their main cultural and economic link with the outside world. They'll vote 'No' and then go along with the result, whatever it is - perhaps with the council trying to squeeze some oil-related concessions or something. I'd guess that Orcadians have much the same attitude, and those are probably the two least-Scottish parts of Scotland.

Scottish Nationalism has been around for a hundred years, trying to build up political support for the cause, and building up a steady momentum towards the referendum in a fortnights time. During this time, Scotland has also had a separate identity, and a separate system of law, government, and education from the rest of the UK.

There isn't any significant or comparable kind of separatist mindset among the people of any region of Scotland (even the linguistic minority - the gaelic speakers of the Western Isles and surrounding area - are politically, more in the nationalist camp than anywhere else), nor is there any formal separation in terms of the governance of those parts of Scotland. If you want to split Scotland up further, and reinstate the Kingdom of Fife or whatever, you're going to have to put in *decades* of tedious grassroots political activism and a lot of thankless work with the population to make that happen.

The reason very few players have come through the academy in recent years is because the standard of the first team is so much higher.

That means that average youngsters simply don't get a chance, for good reason. You have to have standout quality to be given an opportunity.

And this isn't exclusive to City either, it's the same at every club competing for the league. But we really notice it because it wasn't that long ago we weren't competing for the league and a lot of academy players were getting opportunities - often totally bang average ones: Shalem Logan et al.

Saying that, Huws and Lopez both got minutes in League Cup fixtures last year.

Denis Suarez left because Barca came in for him and his head was turned.

They might. They probably won't. If they do I doubt all that much will change in practical term, although on an emotional level it is somewhat upsetting, yes.

&gt;UKIP are dangerous, nasty and getting into bed with Rupert Murdoch

I'm not sure how much staying power they'll have though. Whilst [opinion polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election#Graphical_summary) show that their popularity has risen above the Lib Dems', it is still lagging far behind Labour and the Conservatives. There's a chance it'll split the right vote enough for Labour to get a peek in.

&gt;housing is in crisis no one is doing anything about it

Only in London. Go elsewhere, find a job there, invest in the economy outside the London bubble.

&gt;the left are perpetually on the back foot and forced to try and reclaim the centre

Nothing new here. The left have always been perpetually on the back foot. The fact that they're trying to reclaim the centre shows that they're actually thinking rather than being blindly ideological. This is a good thing.

&gt;voters have decided that politicians are 'all the same' and that's enabling dangerous populists like UKIP to succeed

True, this is a problem. I would place the initial blame largely on the parties though, who have done nothing to stop their MPs from exploiting the system, creating this image.

&gt;our society is horrendously unequal

Not 'horrendously'. Our pre-tax income equality is better than Spain, Japan, Finland, Australia, Belgium, Austria, France, the USA, Germany, Portugal and Italy. Our post-tax position does slip down to only being better than Portugal and the USA, though, which speaks to an imbalance in taxation. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality)

&gt;we seem to be in international decline

We are one of the biggest economies in the world ([8th according to the IMF's GDP PPP tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP)), and the second biggest in the EU (after Germany). We are a member of the EU, which is by many measures a larger economy than the USA, and have the fifth largest military expenditure in the world. [Recent studies have also ranked us top in the world for soft power projection](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/11/18/the-empire-strikes-back-u-k-beats-u-s-in-soft-power-survey-says/) (arts, culture, etc), we are [top in the world for contribution to Science and Technology, and 7th overall according to the Good Country Index](http://www.goodcountry.org/overall).

&gt;youth unemployment is still massive, but those affected are being squeezed harder than ever

[Youth unemployment has fallen to pre-recession levels for the first time since 2008](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/SN05871/youth-unemployment-statistics). [Same for regular unemployment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27046681).

&gt;our government is full of corporate lobbyists, perverting our democracy

Be thankful that they can't give cash donations to parties in the UK.

&gt;electoral reform will apparently never happen

We were given the chance, the people said no.

&gt;our infrastructure is shit

I suggest to visit a country not in the Anglosphere or the EU, and then say it's shit. We have running water, electricity, a complete road network, one of the most extensive railways in the world and are home to some of the biggest airline travel hubs in the world.

&gt;London's dominance is out of control

Yes. Sadly it is. Not anything new here though.

&gt;our education system is leaving our kids without any skills

Is it? More people are going to University than ever before, and as I said earlier, youth unemployment is falling rapidly.

&gt;our NHS and key services are being privatised in stealth, and the replacements are inefficient, profit-driven, low quality and contracted out unfairly.

They aren't inefficient. Efficiency is one of the major advantages of the private sector over the public sector. Additionally, the private contractors are subject to the same oversight as the rest of the NHS, so I actually fail to see the issue as long as it remains free at the point of use.

&gt;no one's quality of life seems much linked to how much work they do. Getting a house is mostly a matter of having homeowning parents.

true,vishbar,null,null,"&gt; I do straight up think America is in a lot of ways an insanely backwards country and I will assume that any American is going to be backwards in someway and hold backwards views. I would avoid talking about anything that could raise these views because I wouldn't want to upset someone, it's just not needed unless specifically asked in which case I'll be brutally honest with a bit more tact than this post.

If I'm honest, I think this speaks a little more to your own ignorance of American culture than anything else. I've noticed this about a lot of British people; I think, because you only get the big news stories from the US, many Brits tend to think they have a much better idea of the life and zeitgeist in the US than they actually do. Take guns, for example. There's a *huge* debate about guns in the US, and many, many people favor UK-style gun regulation. However, because you only get the news about the NRA rallies after school shootings and not the huge protest and debate about gun regulation, you tend to jump to the false conclusion that Americans love ""muh guns"". The same goes for universal healthcare.

I'd challenge you to visit San Francisco, or Manhattan, or Connecticut and look for the gun-grabbers you think Americans tend to be. Also, try to find people there who think universal healthcare is a socialist conspiracy. I think you'd be surprised.

EDIT: It'd be a little like me stereotyping British people as a bunch of UKIP-voting anti-immigration hardliners who want out of the EU. That's certainly the impression given off after a UK election--most coverage tends to be about the far-right party's growing support--but I'd be missing a *huge* amount about British people if I assumed every one would have some racist views. I think that you're doing yourself a disservice--lots of Americans (I'd even say the vast majority) are cheerful, nice, normal people, and you're cutting yourself off to some potential friends or acquaintances by making an assumption that isn't necessarily based in fact.",0,1410101370,null,0,1410101969,0,ckbl3es,t3_2fpowk,t1_ckbl3es,t1_ckbip42,null,1427152113,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

British soldiers have one of the longest and most complete training programs of any regular military. For comparison, basic infantry training for a british soldier is 26 weeks while US Marine Corps is just 12. Royal Marines Commando training courses are 32 weeks, longer if you're an officer.

The result of this is that the resulting soldiers are better quality, fitter, more robust and better trained in tactics and technique. That's why units like SAS, 1 Para, SBS and the SFSG are so outstanding: they have the best candidates to choose from.

The USA's armed forces have the best equipment because they have the most money. But when push comes to shove, you don't want your people to be dependent on technology and air support to succeed.

I would argue that they should actually cut the robotic exterior and replace it with a suit that, while it has mechanical parts, it obviously also has a body inside of it.  If they don't look like robots, it'll be harder for the writers to treat them as robots.

Some other things that go along with this are the cybermen's methods of combat and their general behaviours.  Back in the day, the cybermen were very physical, using hand-to-hand combat to display their superhuman strength.  This can help to make the cybermen more terrifying because, let's face it, something that kills with one of two punches to the upper body is much scarier than something that marches around shooting lasers like a Star Wars battle droid.

The behaviours of the cybermen are worth looking at too.  If they march about saying ""Delete.  Delete.  You will be deleted.  Delete.  Delete."" it's just silly.  It's okay if the daleks shout ""EX-TER-MIN-AAAAAAATE!!!"" because it's much more frightening and is a part of our expectations for the monster, but when the cybermen say ""Delete"" it is more like they're requesting for no one to take them seriously.

That's because it is, it's my honest answer to the question.

&gt;EDIT: It'd be a little like me stereotyping British people as a bunch of UKIP-voting anti-immigration hardliners who want out of the EU.

You wouldn't be totally wrong, not in that we want out of the EU but there's growing contempt for the EU and people have had issues with immigration since at least when I was born, I've heard about ""the bloody pakis come over here and get free money to start corner shops while we're here with nothing"".

&gt; I assumed every one would have some racist views. 

That would be reading too much into the issue.

&gt; I think that you're doing yourself a disservice--lots of Americans (I'd even say the vast majority) are cheerful, nice, normal people, and you're cutting yourself off to some potential friends or acquaintances by making an assumption that isn't necessarily based in fact.

Here's where you're reading too much into what I've said I have no problems with Americans, my dislikes and issues with America and Americans are a general one, I'll of course have preconceptions before talking to an American but I will not put you down a peg and assume it's a waste of time talking to you because you're such a ""backwards"" people.

It's how I've worded it, I've come across as pompous and arrogant when I don't mean to be, I'm trying to show my ignorance and how it affects my attitudes.

I think your country is backwards in areas I think it's absolutely vile that a country so rich lets the poor walk around with bullets in their legs because they can't afford to have it treated and because it's not vital. I think cultural attitudes there are backwards, a greedy capitalistic people who are too lax with social issues such as ghettos. Guns while I don't want them here are not something I view as backwards, I think people should be allowed to shoot guns in rifle ranges but I think that this sense of a need to have more guns than fingers stems from bad policing and overtly armed police which is a chicken and egg problem as well as a political one.

There's a lot of good that I do admire about America, but this is more of a negative thread so I can't show that, you're only get getting me negative views of America.

My issues are very general and mild, American people on their own are fine, Americans as a people are where my issues lie, individuals who agree with these issues I would disagree with but unless they were a dick about it (I mean who really talks about politics on holiday and even then be abrasive about it?) I'd be fine with disagreeing, my life isn't an echo chamber I disagree with people but it's a lot easier IRL to get your point across without looking like a smug pompous cunt which I'm sorry about.

As for it being challenging and/or slow paced - as surprising as you might find it, a lot of kids *do* find school difficult. Unfortunately schools cannot be all things to all people - especially when underfunded and you have class sizes of 35-40 kids in many places. Teachers will have to spend their time focusing on those who *do* struggle. Most teachers would love to challenge all their pupils if they could.

Ofsted grades are often flawed because they focus a lot on results, but they always will do because that's what a lot of parents want.

true,unethical_pirate,null,null,"I think your wrong about the education system especially higher education. As someone that recently left a degree because of exactly this reason. 

The whole point of higher education is to learn to increase your earning potential in the future but because so many people are doing it, it's devalued the worth of it. There's so many people doing degrees that have few job opportunities (which included me). This is a massive misallocation of resources. I learned a lot but nothing that I couldn't do in my spare time because I'm interested in it. Which is was I do now. 

There was a radio advert recently for York St John's university that said '90% of our graduates go on to employment'. I laughed at that, only 90% and they didn't say the type of job. I bet a high percentage where low paid, unskilled work which had no requirement for a degree what so ever. Unemployment figures are at 6.4%, is it worth £30000+ to increase you chances of employment by 3.6%. 

We need to stop encouraging kids to go to university just for the sake of it. So many of my friends were at university because they felt they had no other option and it was the next logical step.   University should be for the smartest people in fields which require it, medicine, law etc, not what we have now with 1000's of people wasting money doing media, sociology, film etc which just doesn't have the number of jobs available. 

Before I went I thought that it would be full of highly intelligent people but it wasn't, as long as you have the cash they'll take you. The amount of people I know with degrees doing low skilled work is ridiculous. A woman with a social work degree is doing care, many of my friends with sports degrees work in factories. We need to be honest with people and stop selling them this idea that going to uni gives to a better life because there's no shame in not going and working your way up in a company through hard work and on the job training. 

If you have potential, work hard, your employers will see that and reward you. I've been working at this manufacturing company for a couple of months. Started minimum wage as an agency worker, turned up early, picked up extra shifts, applied myself and got took on full time. Now they've trained me on a couple of Machines and I'm learning to be a CNC machine operator. They're real life skills which will earn me more money than doing the particular degree I chose. Which was a worthless piece of paper and a photo of me in a cap and gown. 

I looks good going to a fancy university, mine had state of the art facilities, the whole nine yards but the more I learnt the more I released I was going down the wrong path. If anyone reading this is thinking about going to university I can't stress enough to look into the job opportunities in the field, look at the percentage of graduates that get a job in the field and the wages that they get. With all that information is it justified to spend 3/4 years out of the work force to get that degree, when you could have been working your way up and learning about your interests in your own time?

 There's so many courses on the Internet for free that you can take. www.coursera.org is a great website for this, they're are many more.

So aggrieved in fact that I'm going to start my own if Scotland leaves the UK - they're engaging in a way that hasn't been seen for a generation, and I want to start something authentic and good that deals with all the things nobody else will touch. I've actually got a few policies if it's of interest to anyone - mostly I'm concerned with:

* Electoral reform - proportional representation *needs* to happen, and it doesn't need to break the constituency link. The additional member system has been wildly successful in Scotland, and was good enough to use in the London Assembly and the Welsh Assembly, too. It keeps local MPs but makes sure votes are counted proportionally. Nobody today would choose first past the post.

* I'd get rid of the house of lords and replace it with a jury system - a jury for each piece of legislation passed, with a time limit on amendments and the ability to completely kill legislation in its originally proposed form. It's admittedly a bit experimental, and I'm not sure how big to make it, but I think anyone should be eligible to be picked (by lottery) for something like this.

* I'd make the ""housing company"" idea tried in Enfield national, explicitly giving councils the right to do it and giving them access to a fund to get started with. The idea is the council buys up local houses and offers them as either private rentals or social rentals - this changes with the needs of the area. Houses aren't subject to the right to buy, because they're owned by a company (which just happens to be owned by the council). The nice part about this is that housing benefit can be paid on these properties, thereby avoiding the subsidy on landlords we have at the moment.

* Stamp duty should rise with the number of properties owned, to discourage career landlords. There should be an exemption for the scheme described above.

* A complete end on private involvement in the NHS, and a double-CPI-or-above increase in NHS funding per year for at least five years to get the system back on its feet. I'd also consult with the profession about whether or not to revive primary care trusts.

I've gone on a bit now, admittedly. Still, if it's of interest I've got more. I should add I've only covered the NHS briefly, and otherwise have only covered two areas that probably make me sound a bit of a commie - that's not the full picture, I promise :)

Some posters have talked about the mistake of thinking there's a golden age, and I think that's right - but it doesn't mean that we shouldn't have aspirations. ""Life has always been unfair"" and ""It's always been that way"" are non-answers - they're from people who are resigned and bored and disengaged.

Scotland could leave. Maybe. But it won't change much assuming you're from the rest of the UK. Maybe it'll even give a new opportunity for somewhere cool to go.

UKIP are nothing. They had success in EU elections because people are pissed at Europe but they won't be nationally successful. It's simply not worth worrying about.

We haven't really given up civil liberties at all. The UK is still one of the most free places in the world, and I think we balance freedom vs security rather well. We've never proclaimed FREEDOM like the Americans - and look at the problems it gives them. We have legislation against hate speech, and legislation to make our lives easier and more convenient too, which all go against the absolute freedom mentality.

And fwiw, our intel forces and police mostly ARE good guys. There's no secret agenda to spy on your Facebook and look at your girlfriends tits on your phone. They do a pretty shitty job of trying to keep 60 million moaning people safe from nutters. And crime is the lowest it has ever been right now.

Housing crisis - it has ALWAYS been around. People moan one way or the other.

The left - the UK has never really been a left wing society. Always fairly central. And yes, the Tories are pretty central tbh.

Populists - again, they're not succeeding in any measurable way

Inequality - Society isn't that unequal as you make out. And what's more, it doesn't really matter as long as quality of life is improving (which it is)

International decline - not really true at all. The world is changing, and countries with large populations are rising out of total poverty. But the UK still punches far above our weight. We have the greatest soft power in the world. Our science output, art, music, literature, inventions and engineering skills are again much much higher than they should be for such a small country.

Infrastructure isn't that shit. But you have to also be realistic and realise that we usually had some of the first of everything. First railways. First underground system. A lot of rural countryside. It's very easy to point at brand new cities and say how efficient things are, but we are working with 100 year old train lines and houses hundreds of years old that have all needed to be updated with modern connections.

But if you look on a world scale, our infrastructure such as power, mobile coverage, internet speed etc isn't as terrible as you may think!

Against Liverpool towards the end of last season, he rushed off his line mindlessly, like he often does, which allowed Sterling to slot home a straightforward opening goal into an empty net. Next game against Sunderland he was beaten easily at the near post, again, due to poor positioning. These were both games we dropped points in during the title run-in towards the end of the season, errors which could have cost us the title.

He had a poor World Cup.

In preseason I recall him rushing off his line (again) against Olympiakos, allowing them to stroke the ball home into an empty net.

Against Stoke just last week, he was easily beaten by a feeble effort from Diouf - one shot on target = one goal. And we go on to lose the game 0-1.

&gt;Against Liverpool towards the end of last season, he rushed off his line mindlessly, like he often does, which allowed Sterling to slot home a straightforward opening goal into an empty net. 

lol what? He didn't rush off his line, he held a position that should've had Kompany covering the side of him...


Sterling turned and beat Hart &amp; Kompany, if Hart is at fault for that goal, Kompany is just as much.


&gt;Next game against Sunderland he was beaten easily at the near post, again, due to poor positioning. These were both games we dropped points in during the title run-in towards the end of the season, errors which could have cost us the title.



He was in the correct position to cover both the shot or a cross, if he completely commits to the near post Wickham can just pass across the box and he's fucked.

He should've made the save, but it was a good shot, nothing to do with poor positioning.

You cannot hold it against a keeper because he should've made a save.. That's absolutely ridiculous and by that logic you will never ever be happy with a keeper. 


&gt;He had a poor World Cup.

lol what? no he didn't.

This just sums up your bullshit. 


I think we've found the problem here, you are absolutely clueless when it comes to goalkeeping. 


You're ignorantly spewing nonsense about poor positioning when you don't remotely understand it.

He did rush off his line for the goal in question against Liverpool, he shouldn't have, and Sterling was subsequently able to stroke the ball into a open net.

The goal against Sunderland was indefensible. He should not have been beaten at that distance and from that angle at his near post. The end. His positioning was terrible, regardless of what you may say.

I'm highlighting errors, I'm not highlighting every single goal he concedes, as you can't expect any goalkeeper to save everything thrown at him. But what you can do is be critical of errors in positioning or decision making which lead to goals. Likewise there are occasions where criticisms of shot stopping are valid.

He did have a poor World Cup. He made no massive glaring errors, but he had a poor World Cup. In contrast to say for example Keylor Navas, who had a great World Cup.

I'm not holding him solely responsible for the goal against Stoke, but we're not analysing the culpability of every other player in the build up to the goal, we're analysing Joe's culpability in the goal. He should have saved it.

Maybe if you'd played the game yourself, or actually attended games instead of being an armchair football fan without any particular club (besides being a fanboy of one or two players), then you'd understand these criticisms and acknowledge their validity?

London simply has a big enough population to support its infrastructure and more which is why they have it. 

Let's think of it in terms of buses. In the north a company must buy a bus and reclaim that from fares but the population is low so it takes a longer time to recoup or they must put fares up. In London tfl can reclaim the cost of their identical bus much faster even at a low fare simply because they have so many customers. 

Also let's not forget London's benefits are funded by local government, not Westminster despite what you seem to think and the cost of living in all other aspects is astronomically higher so taking that into account London's citizens aren't dominant individually.

true,boffcheese,null,null,"I only did a module on Jack the Ripper at uni, so I'm not anywhere near an expert, but to speak frankly the claim that *""Only non-believers that want to perpetuate the myth""* is bollocks.

Firstly, there is no way to know for sure how many of the murders were committed by the same person. The article mentions five, but IIRC only three were 'confirmed' by the Met as having the same culprit. Five is the generally accepted number of victims, with some including more to make the total victim count of the Ripper up to seven or higher.

Secondly, it was *over one hundred years ago*. There is no possible way to declare that you have solved a crime such as this (a crime with unknown numbers of victims, an unknown motive, and investigated without the technology or protocol we have today) without it being laughable. 

And finally, Jack the Ripper is an invention of the media of the time. The stories and tales we think of when he is mentioned are the product of the sensationalist penny-awfuls and tabloids of the 1880s. The ""Ripper"" killings were, and evidently still are, a easy way to sell papers. Every other murder was attributed to this single, murderous individual. Is he a surgeon? A Jew? A Pole? A noble? Is he insane? Does he hate women? What about a butcher, since his actions are such a butchery? Let's call him Leather Apron. Oh wait, there's a letter where the supposed-killer calls himself [Jack the Ripper](http://www.casebook.org/ripper_letters/) so lets go with that. 

The famous ""Dear Boss"" letter, which was the first use of the name ""Jack the Ripper"", could easily have been written by a journalist looking for a new angle on the killings. That's just it: **we don't, and never will, know for certain**. 

If anyone is interested in equally ""final"" and ""definitive"" works such as this, consider reading Stephen Knights' ""*Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution*"" or Patricia Cornwells' ""*Portrait of a Killer*"", both of which claimed to have discovered the Rippers identity and both have been widely discredited by historians and ""ripperologists"" alike. Knight based his book on a story about royal conspiracies, while Cornwell (who is a esteemed thriller writer when she isn't busy solving century-old crimes) sculpted the persona of a serial killer from, essentially, a single painting. Some might recall the discovery of the Ripper Diaries in the 1990s, which also captivated media attention for a time before Michael Barrett [admitted that he forged them.](http://casebook.org/suspects/james_maybrick/mb-con.bjan5.html)

There have been numerous high-profile discoveries of Jack the Ripper's identity, and *every single one* has been discredited. True, this latest one uses DNA evidence to press the claim, which is arguably more compelling than any others, but I am skeptical. The shawl might not be genuine, the material that the DNA was taken might be contaminated, and the samples used to confirm the killer's DNA are from people generations apart from the accused. Considering this revelation has been accompanied by a book, this strikes me as yet another attempt to cash in on the unsolvable crime.

(Holy shit this got away from me. This started as a simple comment of skepticism, but I suppose I found that module more captivating than I thought)

**TL:DR: This is not the first claim to have ""definitively"" solved the Ripper murders, and in time will likely be just as discredited.**",0,1410112982,null,0,false,0,ckbq9ff,t3_2fpyl5,t1_ckbq9ff,t3_2fpyl5,null,1427146965,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

 [**The finger**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20finger): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;In [Western culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture), __the finger__ (as in __giving someone the finger__ or __the bird__ ), also known as __the finger wave__, __the middle finger__, __flipping someone off__,  __flipping the bird__, __shooting the bird__, __the rude finger__ or __the one finger salute__ is an [obscene hand gesture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscene_hand_gesture). It communicates moderate to extreme contempt, and is roughly equivalent in meaning to [""fuck off"", ""fuck you""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck#Modern_usage), ""shove it up your ass"", ""up yours"" or ""go fuck yourself."" It is performed by showing the back of a closed fist that has only the [middle finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_finger) extended upwards, though in some locales the thumb is extended. Extending the finger is considered a symbol of contempt in several cultures, especially Western cultures. Many cultures use similar gestures to display their disrespect, though others use it to express pointing with no intentional disrespect toward other cultures. The gesture dates back to [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece) and was also used in [Ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome). Historically, it represented the [phallus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallus). In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists, athletes, and politicians. Most still view the gesture as obscene.

This episode was completely formulaic and might aswell have had a dog and a celebrity guest appearance.

Also the addition of a dashing Robin Hood was for the female viewers to have some sort of compensation for losing their attractive young doctor.

Yes. He had a poor World Cup, he didn't make a single noteworthy save, his distribution was typically poor, and his sole noteworthy contribution was kicking an advertising hoarding.

true,docmuppet,eng-sussex,Brighton,"So first you criticise the foreigners in London for being foreign and now you're deeming entire ethnicities unemployed? Make your mind up whether you hate the foreigners or are standing up for them.

You seem to be a bit irrational about this (in a ""wah London gets this and I don't, stupid Londoners"" sort of way) so I'll try to explain it as simply as possible so there's nothing to become outraged about.


London has 8 million people living it making it far and away the most populous city in the UK (there is more people in London than Scotland).

Those 8 million people pay council tax, this goes to paying for London's services (actually if you are including LAS and LFB they service 15 million people) and the population of London pretty much doubles between 9-5, this means that services like TFL are making a shit tonne of money which they can spend on services. No other city in the UK has a commuter population anything like London (so if you look at LAS and LFB again, they are now servicing 30mil people during the day).

Local government is supplemented somewhat by government funding but its important to remember two things here

1. Government spending is scaled, they give money out per person in the area, a city of 8mil gets more than a city of 300k, this makes total sense. 

2. Londoners have £2500 less per person spent on them by national government than the rest of the country

And finally, to reiterate an earlier point you ignored. Cost of living us astronomically high in London. If you spent a year paying £10 per day for your bus (to work and back) rather than £2.70 in London you still wouldn't come close to the difference in yearly rent or mortgage payments and don't suggest that people in London earn a higher wage because very few employers actually pay the London living wage and the very few people who earn huge salaries do so at companies like PWC and UBS at their global headquarters but this isn't available in the north and therefore not comparable (you can't go up to the CEO of one of the biggest global companies in the world and suggest they don't put their HQ in the capital city).",0,1410114409,null,0,false,0,ckbr1xt,t3_2fpfxi,t1_ckbr1xt,t1_ckbpyja,null,1427146091,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I feel exactly the same way. 

One one hand, you need to understand how you are made aware of this information. The News. How do you get your news? Many (most?) newspapers sell only bad news. So one needs to make a conscious effort to balance this by reading uplifting stories/ items.

And on the other hand, reading independent reports on the state of affairs is key to getting a true picture.

I think this 2013 PDF report by UNICEF on child well-being is very informative: http://www.unicef.org.uk/Images/Campaigns/FINAL_RC11-ENG-LORES-fnl2.pdf

&gt;This league table presents 
the latest available overview of child 
well-being in 29 of the world’s most 
advanced economies. 
Five dimensions of children’s lives 
have been considered: material 
well-being, health and safety, 
education, behaviours and risks, and 
housing and environment. In total, 
26 internationally comparable 
indicators have been included in the 
overview.

Child well-being is a key measure because when a country creates ""happy"" children, they are building a strong future for themselves.

* CHEAP STUFF - Go 1hour before closing. Fresh food gets yellow stickered. Good for dinner that night or breakfast tomorrow. Sometimes get a feast worth of chicken/pork etc... from the cooked meat counter for like 20p a bag portion.

* Tesco/Iceland SAVE CASH- Go to Tesco and see prices, Go to Iceland then buy if cheaper. Go back to Tesco and get the rest. You can literally save a small fortune getting EXACTLY the same stuff.

*eg... Milk 2 litres @ Tesco £1.40, £1 in Iceland.... tin of soup £1 iceland/ 80p tesco. Packet of Ham £1.50 Tesco, £2 Iceland* 

More shopping... 

* TIP - Always convert Items to same unit, then compare price. Coffee @ cost per 100g for example. ""Special offers"" don't look so special when you see the cheaper items. 

* TIP - Check bottom shelves in supermarkets for best prices.

* FREE STUFF - Tesco will refund you AND give you the item bought....IF it is mislabeled in price. When ""offer term"" ends, that day, in the morning ... look for the price labels they have missed. Buy product. Take receipt and product to Customer Services. Say you were over charged. They go and check, bring back label and give you free stuff and your money back.

General

* LOWER COST OF VIRGIN MEDIA- (when you are out of your first contract) Phone Virgin Media...tell them you want to cancel. You will get put through to the ""Cancellation department"". Tell them you can get a better deal with B.T whatever...and that's why you **want to** cancel. They will offer you every deal they can to keep you. The cable is already there in your house. It's a waste if they don't give you every possible offer.

* ELECTRIC (CHEAPER) - Cards are cheaper. You get a discount for using a PAYG meter. 

buses 

* BUS INNER ZONE - IF you are close to city center there are ""inner zones"" were bus journeys are cheaper. Usually the first 4 or so stops out of the city center are inner zone. Sure it may mean getting on/off the bus one stop early/later. It's a saving.

* BUS ""DAY TICKET"" -  IF you travel more than 3 metro buses a day..... gets you unlimited metro buses all day. Price depends on when you buy it... £3.70 (Before 09:30 Monday to Friday, After 15:00 Monday to Friday, After 19:00 Saturday and Sunday)  £3.20 all other times.

* BUS- USE A METRO CARD ffs -  5 journeys (minimum topup) £5.75 ... 1 journey cash £1.90. (inner zone price 5 journeys £4.75)

&gt; It remains quite strange that YouGov have shown this sharp narrowing in the race while Panelbase haven’t. The difference is not just an outlying poll – while one single poll could be a freak result, YouGov has shown a consistent narrowing in the face over three polls. It’s not down to any methodological change – this poll was conducted using exactly the same methodology as YouGov’s previous poll. The only recent change in methods was four polls ago, introducing weighting by place of birth, and both YouGov and Panelbase introduced that at about the same time. Things like a differential willingness to respond to polls (people who support a campaign on the up being more likely to click on the email) should affect both Panelbase and YouGov the same – they are both online companies using a panel based system. One possibility is simply that the different trends are down to the same reasons behind the previous differences between Panelbase and YouGov. Both use weighting by Holyrood recalled vote as a core weighting variable, but YouGov also break out a proportion of people who voted SNP in 2011 but Labour in 2010. Perhaps if those people – people’s whose loyalty at Holywood and Westminster is divided between the SNP and Labour – had previously been more NO, but have moved towards YES this month, and are more represented in YouGov’s sample?

That aside, Capaldi is brilliant. If he keeps it up, he's going to surpass Tennant as my favorite...and I don't say that lightly. He's got this amazing dry, grumpy humor.

Basically we're just tracking the world3 model of limits to growth [as explained here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/limits-to-growth-was-right-new-research-shows-were-nearing-collapse).  Unfortunately peak oil is just one head on a hydra, you've also got oceanic pollution and the collapse of fisheries, loss of topsoil due to erosion and modern farming practices, climate change, antibiotic resistant bacteria, deforestation, rapid rates of biodiversity loss, an *incredibly* fragile financial system, a massive urban population which is incredibly dependant on long, complex and fragile supply chains for basic survival necessities and god knows what else.

It's a delightful result from the mixture of superexponential population growth, finite resources, finite environmental waste sinks.  We're at the point where we're starting to see declining marginal returns on societal complexity, which is something that Joseph Tainter pinpoints as the beginning of the collapse of complex societies.  I think that it's a high probability that some kind of societal collapse will occur within our lifetime, probably soon and probably triggered by either the financial crisis part 2 or peak oil the second.

You're absolute right that there's no sense blaming anyone, though, nobody meant for this to happen.  There was no design to build this ludicrous society and economy that we constructed, it just sort of self-organised.  We've built ourselves into a trap, and we're all going to forgive people's sins and work together if we're going to come out of the next few decades in anything close to good shape.

&gt;Local government is supplemented somewhat by government funding

Government provides a block grant to local authorities which amounts to the vast majority of their funding, around 85% of their net revenue expenditure, with the remainder funded largely from local taxation, i.e. Council Tax.

No. This is a very selective measure that exludes tens of billions of expenditure: HS2, Cross rail, super sewer, Airports,

The Institute for Public Policy Research North says £2,700 is spent per person in London compared with £5 per head in the north-east of England.



The Treasury figures show £10,152 was spent per head on public services in Scotland in the 2012/13 financial year, £1,364 more than the UK average.
However, this advantage increases to £1,623 when comparing spending in Scotland and England, where the average figure is only £8,529.
Of all the UK’s regions, spending is only higher in Northern Ireland (£10,876). Wales gets £9,709 per head, £1,180 more than the English.
In England **public spending is highest per head in London** (£9,435), the North East (£9,419) and North West (£9,252). The South East outside the capital (£7,638) and the East of the country (£7,865) get the least funding",0,1410118553,null,0,false,0,ckbt881,t3_2fpfxi,t1_ckbt881,t1_ckbr1xt,null,1427143234,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

On performances so far you might argue JWP could make way but he's undoubtedly a future star and we need to put faith in him to ensure his development.

You move away from the UK for some particular reason, lets say you go live in the states.  
Lets then say the right-wing in the UK get into power (while you're state side) and some little Hitler goes for a coup and manages to get a stranglehold on ol' Blighty.  
The population revolts, a civil war starts. You receive desperate messages from your friends and family still in the UK.  They're dying, they're being slaughtered. Its all out war, they ask for your help.  

WHAT DO YOU DO?  

Lets then say you choose to fight, so you back to the UK and join forces to fight the dictator. The war goes on and an and inner politics begin to take hold. The biggest power broker becomes a deeply Christian organisation and they create an alliance that your forces become part of.  
They take Cornwall, the fight continues. However while you're at the front the people that aren't Christian are being burnt at the stake by this organisation back in Cornwall. You might be Christian yourself but you're probably not down with this. The Christian organisation start to gain more and more military control while your comrades from your original group start thinning out due to causalities of war.  You're alone and no longer sure if you're fighting for the right cause.  
Meanwhile in the US news of the stake burning has reached the media and you're vilified along with the rest.

They also have to compete with other private companies to offer the best deal to the NHS. Which leaves the £15m they never had before to use on something else.

Whether you accept that or not kind of comes down to your ideology and beliefs, really. 

Do you believe private companies are more efficient than a public NHS because of the motive of profit?

Do you believe that the money saved will be reinvested in the NHS elsewhere? 

Do you believe that a private company can provide the same or higher quality of service as a public NHS? 

Do you believe that it's okay for the owners/directors/shareholders/etc to make profit from running parts of the health system?

Do you believe that there is risk in moving parts of the healthcare system into the hands of private companies?

Do you trust that these private companies can be stopped from having influence over the people who decide which private companies get the contracts? 

Do you believe that it's always going to be more expensive for the NHS to do something than paying a private company to do it?

* I still feel like that the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Doctor did make the decision as the War Doctor to blow it up and did so alone as this is the only way that the Doctor could have died on Trenzalore and left a scar in space-time. The entire time they talk about the day they did it, it is always in concrete terms. They know what they did that day, they saw it. There is no way that they could remember the moment Gallifrey burned so exactly if they were all there to save it.

 However from the universe's perspective he never did destroy Gallifrey and the Daleks (who mostly destroyed themselves) and instead saved Gallifrey. So basically the Moment limited the destruction of Gallifrey and the Daleks to the Doctor's timeline only. He survived the Time War because he had destroyed everyone. But the Moment saw that the Doctor did not wish to use it but alone there was nothing else he could do.

 She then gave the Doctor a chance to make the choice by pulling in the Doctor's from the future who had actually experienced using the Moment. She wanted to know if the Doctor was still capable of the decision after seeing who he would become. And he still decided there was no other way, that is until the three of them came to the shack together.

 So until Eleven made that final decision not to use the Moment, to the Doctor he had destroyed Gallifrey and it was in his past. But through the Moment he was able to save Gallifrey for his future incarnations. I would say this is further confirmed by the fact that he dies on Trenzalore in the future before The Day of the Doctor and does not after The Day of the Doctor.

So basically the Moment allowed the Doctor to change his own future on Trenzalore since he no longer destroyed Gallifrey from his perspective and his timeline is now in sync with the rest of the universe.

As for the Time Lords really is all a mystery and hard to make any speculation because we have know idea what is going on wherever they are. They most likely only had a limited amount of power and used it all up  to send the regenerations cycle through so the Doctor could make it safer for them to come back. Whether they have good or ill intentions in coming back is anyone's guess. But either way they need the Doctor to save them.

Here's what he actually said

&gt; When the British thought that they ruled south Armagh, south Armagh was being ruled from Peter John Carragher's house , boasted Burns. 

&gt;He referred to Carragher as a former ""officer commanding of Oglaigh na hEíreann ""

Fairly damning. Of course I've no idea how you interpret that. Maybe the killing of Protestants, soldiers, civilians, isn't high on your agenda of being all open minded, etc, etc.

&gt;He says he spoke about his neighbour, he also said  'I'd be offended if someone took a comment at a rally about a neighbour of mine as any way whatsoever supporting violence or suporting people being killed.  That was unscripted.  I probably should have scripted it a wee bit better and shown a bit more sensitivity, but the point I was making was Peter John Caraher was someone who went the same journey as Martin McGuinness.'

You do realise the crimes both of those individuals have committed during the troubles? You do realise the only reason McGuiness is listened to is because people are prepared to vote for an IRA terrorist to stick a finger up to themmuns?

even if only 4 million people pay council tax thats still far and away more than any other city in the country. 

Why should London not recieve government funding? last time I checked they were part of the UK? Just because you don't seem to like London doesn't mean they are not entitled to the same as everyone else in the country. 

Londoners have £2500 less per person spent on them by national government. This is an irrefutable fact and you can't decide to try and change it because it ruins your argument. Here is why you are wrong.

HS2 (and HS1 for that matter) IS NOT FOR LONDONERS. Why would a Londoner need to commute from Yorkshire or Birmingham to London? They don't use it. It is very specifically for people who are not Londoners to use to get into London. 

Cross rail and airports again is not for Londoners (mostly) it is for people who commute to London by air travel, benefiting the economy and the whole country as one. But much more importantly than that are you trying to argue that there are no airports in the north? I think you might be wrong there. 

As for sewers, I think a City of 8 million people could probably do with an upgrade to its 100 year old (at the very least) Victorian sewer network that was designed for a population less than 10% of its current population? Oh and are you trying to say there are no sewers in the north either? I think you're probably wrong on that count to. 

Finally lets address your treasury figures since I think you probably think they help your argument rather than help mine. 

Lets take the lowest spending in the North (£9252) and compare it with London (£9435), that's a difference on a whopping £193 per head. Lets do a couple of things with this:

Does this make up for the increased cost of living in London? No, in fact its miles off. An extra couple of thousand would put it on a par. 

Does this include the fact that London, as the biggest city in the country needs a massive amount of services which quite simply are not needed elsewhere? (again look at the size of LAS, LFB and the Met). No, its actually to little when you think about the fact that the extra cost of these required services for a large city is almost certainly more than £200 each.

**And most importantly** does this extra £200 reflect the increased income Londoners bring to the national economy (and therefore help to pay for services in the north). Once again no, try another couple of thousand. 

So all in all Londoners do pay an awful lot more in than they are given.

Oh and lets look at the lowest per income area, the South East. They get the lowest amount of government funding yet we have the best quality of life.

This is the crux


&gt;Londoners have £2500 less per person spent on them by national government. This is an irrefutable fact and you can't decide to try and change it because it ruins your argumen

vs


&gt;spending in the North (£9252) and compare it with London (£9435), that's a difference on a whopping £193 per head. Lets do a couple of things with this:

Which is it?

Do you understand that the money is not physically given to them so the 'cost of living' argument makes no sense. 

Economy of scale/ the ability to share services/ concentration of need/ the amount of infrsstructue already there.

&gt;massive amount of services which quite simply are not needed elsewhere

Is that becuase of all that coastline or the mountains or the hundred islands?


&gt;Londoners bring to the national economy 

Rofl. Do you think each and every Londoner is a young zuckeraberg?
Its a tiny amount of very wealthy people skewing the results. And they dont fucking live there.

The UK has already entered into numerous treaties that provide for investor-state arbitration. So, to be fair, investor-state dispute settlement has long existed in the UK.

Seriously, reread the article and find one quote about ethnicity, race, or women.  Post one quote about that from [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/aug/28/rotherham-abuse-south-yorkshire-police-victims-john-mann-shaun-wright) (which is the articel you linked to) and I'll gild you for it.

This article uses vague language *precisely* so that people like you can make the assumptions you are making.  Despite that, the real issue is still obvious:

&gt;The HMIC verdict echoed the finding by Prof Alexis Jay that the police ""gave no priority to child sexual exploitation, regarding many child victims with contempt and failing to act on their abuse as a crime""

Prof Alexis Jay also found that the 1,400 victims of sexual exploitation in Rotherham were overwhelmingly *white girls* who were deliberately targeted by *Pakistani men*.  Her report also found that political correctness, specifically fear of being labeled racist, was a major factor in official misconduct in those cases.

[Here's the report](http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham)

And here are some quotes:  

&gt;Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.

...

&gt;frontline staff appeared to be confused as to what they were supposed to say and do and what would be interpreted as 'racist'

...

&gt;Those who had involvement in CSE were acutely aware of these issues and recalled a general nervousness in the earlier years about discussing them, for fear of being thought racist.

...

&gt;Several councillors interviewed believed that by opening up these issues they could be 'giving oxygen' to racist perspectives

...

&gt;most of the victims in the cases we sampled were white British children, and the majority of the perpetrators were from minority ethnic communities

...

&gt;In Rotherham, the majority of known perpetrators were of Pakistani heritage including the five men convicted in 2010

...

&gt;Agencies should acknowledge the suspected model of localised grooming of young
white girls by men of Pakistani heritage, instead of being inhibited by the fear of
affecting community relations.

If I (in London) earn £2 and I am given £3 worth of services and I have to pay £2 I finish with £0.

If you (up north) earn £1 (the wage gap is not this large but you seem to think it is so I'll give it to you) and you are given £2.90 (the difference given per head between London and the north is actually less than this when scaled down) and have to pay £1 (due to lower cost of living) you end up with £2.90. 

See how, despite receiving less money from the government Londoners actually end up with less in real terms?

Moving on to your other comments of course I am not under the impression that every Londoner is a millionaire but the average wage, even when not skewed by the Russian oligarchs etc, is still higher than the north and therefore they contribute more. London is not a city of a couple of billionaires and everyone else on minimum wage. There are plenty of people who earn around £50k a year (they are in no way a tiny minority) and there simply aren't as many up north because that's not where those jobs are. 

Also I really don't understand what you are trying to say about coastland and mountains. I wasn't aware a mountain needed an ambulance when it felt sick?

There is upwards of 15 million people in London on any given day. They need more paramedics and police officers than a town of 300k. How you are trying to say otherwise is ridiculous.

Edit: one more thing, you seem particularly against people that pay to live in London but don't actually live there. Surely this is what you want?

It actually works better than the Andriod Snapchat app in my opinion - you can use photos you've already got stored on the phone, pause playback of snaps, etc. Can't screenshot though.

I used to have an Android phone, and at first I preferred it. But since the latest Windows update, this phone has taken over. Apart from the relatively small selection of apps (and that'll get better as more people get WP) there's not much difference, really.

My pet peeves... tricky. The camera isn't that great, which can be a pain, but it's good enough. Sometimes apps crash, but you get that on any smartphone. It's an ok speed, not mega fast, but not really slow, either. To be honest, I don't have any big issues with it. It does everything you could want and expect from a cheap smartphone.

Also, one big positive that I discovered recently is how simple the construction is. I broke my screen (dropped it on a stone floor, doh) and didn't want to shell out to get it fixed, so I ordered a screen repair kit from eBay for about £10 and did it myself. It was so simple - take out a couple of screws, take off I think three layers, take out the old screen, put the new one in place, screw everything back together, and bingo. Works perfectly. There aren't many phones nowadays that an individual with no experience of phone mechanics can take apart almost completely, AND put back together, AND have them still working!

true,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"

A reformed Eurocommunist post-Marxist New Leftist Frankfurt School professor and social democrat was teaching a class on Nikita Khrushchev, known revisionist.

""Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Leon Trotsky as the most class conscious revolutionary of all time and accept the Fourth International as the only legitimate representative of the interests of the workers of the world!""

At this moment a brave, revolutionary, unreformed Stalinist NKVD veteran who had an appreciation for socialist realist art and read a chapter of Capital every night before going to sleep stood up and waved the red flag.

""If Trotsky was so great, why wasn’t the revolution permanent?""

The arrogant professor smirked quite bourgeoisly and smugly replied, “Because the Soviet Union was a deformed workers state, you idiot gerontocrat!”

""Wrong. Comrade Stalin purged Russia of the kulaks and all enemies of the workers. If your theory of revolution was correct, we would have achieved communism by now.""

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of A People’s History of the United States. He stormed out of the room crying those social-fascist crocodile tears. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, Noam Chomsky, wished he had adopted the policies of the Third Period and become more than an infantile leftist bourgeois stooge. He wished so much that he had not betrayed the revolution, but he himself had sold it out!

The students applauded and all sang the State Anthem of the USSR and accepted Socialism in One Country as the best path forward for proletarian cause. An eagle named “Slavoj Zizek” flew into the room and perched atop a copy of “Pravda” and sniffed snot onto its print. The last sentence of the “The Communist Manifesto” was read several times, and Sergei Eisenstein himself showed up and demonstrated how to roll a baby down the Odessa steps.

The professor lost his tenure and was taken out back and shot the next day. He loved Big Brother.

The student’s name?

Lavrentiy Beria.

Personally? I feel quite differently.

He does quite the opposite to inspiring confidence in me. He concerns me. He worries me. I think his development stalled, and then began a steep decline over the past two years.

I think he's regressed as a goalkeeper, and shown no signs of turning it around.

[More stats](http://164.177.157.12/img/blog/2013%2F10%2FHartBlog.jpg)

He's always had weaknesses to his game: distribution, decision making, and concentration. And we always hoped these would improve, they haven't, in fact they've become more glaring.

In the meantime his one biggest strength - his shot stopping, has regressed so much that it's no different to an average goalkeeper. He'll still pull off the occasional superb instinctive save, but these all too infrequent moments fail to conceal a wider trend. Combined with the weaknesses mentioned previously he becomes all too often a liability, and, in my opinion, the weakest link in what is a very strong side at present.

He's 27 now, so youth is no longer an excuse. He's older than a lot of the goalkeepers who he's compared to statistically in my OP.

I think his situation is not too dissimilar to Micah's: showed enormous promise at a young age, received a lot of hype, development stalled, eventually regressing as a player, to no longer making the required grade at the level we now play.

I think if he doesn't turn it around this year, and drastically, then I think we won't renew his contract. If that happens he'll probably leave next summer in order to resurrect his career at a midtable club. Again, much like Micah.

I think there's a strong likelihood that this time next year Caballero will have spent most of the season as number 1, and we might be looking for a genuinely top draw alternative with Caballero eventually going to number 2.

I also think in such a scenario Joe would've lost, or be close to losing, his status as England number 1 to Fraser Forster.

This is all worst case for Joe of course, but I think this is what awaits unless he turns it around majorly, or the board give him a new contract out of sentimentality and his homegrown status.

But like we've seen with Micah, eventually sentiment will always take a back seat to the progression of the side and club.

Make no mistake, this is an enormous year for Joe - make or break in fact.

I hope he does it, but I'm very sceptical that he will.",0,1410125332,null,0,1410125685,0,ckbwubb,t3_2fqudf,t1_ckbwubb,t1_ckbvghy,null,1427138808,11,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,11

The quality of media articles as I'm sure we all know is gash, and there's been virtually nothing in any real depth at all.

It would take me more than 15 minutes to properly explain to someone why the currency issue is an absolute disaster because I'd have to start with macro economics. 

I also question what the lead researcher has to say, and since it looks clear to me he has a bias I wonder if it's actually properly applied the scientific method or if he's just shat out a study and drawn conclusions to suit his own bias.

&gt;Davide Morisi, from the European University Institute in Florence and lead researcher on the study, said: ""Since independence is related to more uncertainty than keeping the status quo, reading convincing arguments has a stronger effect on a yes vote, because it contributes to reducing these uncertainties to an 'acceptable' level.""

&gt;He added that, while it might seem obvious that it is possible to demonstrate that information has a causal effect on indecision, ""it is quite astonishing to think that the subjects read this material for only 15 minutes but it still had a great effect. This is good news for the referendum campaign.""

Edit : More on the marketing thing.

In sales you try to close the deal while the customer is still interested, this research seems to have done that. There's little to the 'no' side of things really unless you explore very complex issues. However for the yes side of things it's a marketing pitch. It makes sense for people to be engaged afterwards. That's why there's a cooling off period on sales and why time share presentations want you to sign up before you leave the room.

I'd be more interested if...

* There was more than 15 minutes of browsing articles involved
* People were given a proper presentation by other people
* It lasted a reasonable length of time to allow the issues to be explored - a few hours perhaps
* The responses were measured at the time and also a week later

I think yes is a more emotional position than no. This may well show it but we can't really tell. It's poor research to say the least.",0,1410126488,null,0,1410127007,0,ckbxfai,t3_2fr112,t1_ckbxfai,t1_ckbxa3e,null,1427138495,7,false,scottishpolitics,t5_2u66o,7

Aside from that, no.  We're surrounded by examples of privatisation just not working and in the case of healthcare there's a huge example sitting over the water for us to look at.  People will argue that no, we're going for a more European style model, mixed public/private etc. but that requires a faith in politicians to not do what they inevitably do which is provide a reliable means of making their friends richer.  Of course there are already long standing privately operated but integral parts of the NHS in community pharmacy and GP services which works reasonably well so yes, with the proper oversight and regulations that can't just be bent and ignored maybe there is room for a certain amount more private sector involvement in the NHS.  

The problem is that there's a lot of money to be made and you can bet that they'll be ruthless in doing so, we're pretty much an entirely new market for the privates and they want to get it sewn up.

Yes actually its not Scottish debt it is British debt and as such has been guaranteed completely by the Treasury so any non payment of that debt would be a default by the UK not Scotland. If it were Scottish debt why the hell is the UK promising to pay the debts of a foreign country? The general precedent is that the successor state continues to hold the debt at least legally and any taking of liabilities by the new state is up for negotiation.

&gt; Why on earth should they have currency union?

Scotland would be the UK's second largest trading partner, if you're business was heavily relied on imports from or exports to Scotland would you be happy paying having to pay currency exchange fees? As has also been set out Scotland has no legal obligation to take any debt so the UK will be left with a higher debt to GDP ratio which will affect credit worthiness leading to an increase in the cost of borrowing money. With a currency union these things will be avoided.

As for your comparisons to Catalonia, the Basque Country and Crimea all of those would be/were unilateral declarations of independence so the process in many ways is not comparable to Scotland.

You've also conveniently overlooked the whole European angle. There is no guarantee that they will be taken into Europe. 

You seem to think that the only bargaining chip on the table is the Pound. There's European membership which is a biggie. Where are all their subsidies to come from if not us (and don't for one second try and claim that they aren't subsidised by the rest of the UK). If they had gotten independence forty years ago when North Sea Oil was just coming online then yes, they had something of value. And they are right to be pissed that those riches were syphoned off but they have been.

There's way more at stake for them than just the pound. It really is an empty threat.

And you talk of it not being agreed. Well what is to stop the UK simply making taking on their share of the National debt a condition of letting them go? They really are not in a position of strength on that. I can just see Cameron (or whoever) saying fine, we agree to independence but you're not walking away from a debt you accrued. They can't do it unilaterally.

4 very good reasons for this:

1) If there is a no vote its just wasted time, if there is a yes vote the costs of organising independence will be substantial and therefore dealing with those costs is a good bargaining chip for the rUK. The rUK will want to put a cost on independence.

2) They might come up with some really good plans! Which would be mutually beneficial and super efficient, and that would be terrible for the No campaign.

3) The can make Salmond seem like he doesn't have a plan... Currently Salmond's main weakness is that he's saying stuff that he can't back up (like ""we'll keep the pound"" or ""We'll give the nukes back"") and westminster is just saying, ""err, don't bank on that"" or ""we haven't decided"", they're just being super vague, and it makes Salmond seem like an idiot who hasn't thought anything through. Well as soon as they decide, yes or no, then Salmond actually seems a lot more competent and can actually plan what will actually happen.

4) Making a plan for 'Yes' will show that at least in part Westminster thinks it might happen, and that will make people more likely to vote yes (people are sheep). So if Westminster doesn't even entertain the idea it actually helps strengthen the No campaign.

Westminster really has nothing to gain by putting plans in place now, deal with that stuff after the election, when you know what the actual situation is, and can drive a really hard bargain.",0,1410129487,null,0,false,0,ckbyuoj,t3_2fqajq,t1_ckbyuoj,t1_ckboycx,null,1427137259,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

We have always viewed currency union without political union as being very dangerous for at least one of the parties due to the different requirements each nation needs, its partly why joining the Euro was viewed with such scepticism and the only attempt to join ended in disaster. Though that could have been a blessing in disguise, had we been in the Euro during the last depression we would have been even more stuffed than we already were. 

As Soros did so do others want to do now, they want to make money, lots of it, and would see a great chance at doing so in the situation of a unequal currency union with sketchy support.

Then there is the fact that later on iScotland wants to join the Euro, which would necessitate breaking the currency union. I can see no upside to two periods of upheaval in relatively short succession for rUK.

He was found in stories and legends, all over the universe, and some people even knew him by name.

Even stretching back to Tennant's era, Davros made a point of showing The Doctor what he did to people. The Doctor never needed to fight because he always had people like Martha, and Captain Jack, and Sarah Jane, willing to sacrifice themselves in his name for the greater good. The conversation with Robin Hood touched on that a bit, too, when he mentions how his legend could inspire others, whether they think it's true or not. Robin Hood was of the opinion that this is a good thing, but the Doctor, when confronted in the fight against Davros, lamented it.

&gt;Steven Moffat is posed the question in the latest issue of DWM and explains that the Chapter is definitely still out there and they could return, although it might not be for a while.

&gt;He says: “Kovarian, logically, is still alive. The whereabouts remain a terrible mystery. Will she return to menace the Doctor again? Will she ever resume her once happy marriage with Tasha Lem (just a thought, but imagine the domestics!). Perhaps.”

&gt;He adds: “But let’s be honest: if Amy Pond, River Song, and a two-thousand-year-old Centurian who blows up Cyber fleets for emphasis were all pissed off with you at once, you might stay quiet for a bit.”

The reason that Doctor Who became more popular (at least in the US) circa series 5 has more to do with the fact that it was actually advertised here leading up to series 5 and they started airing the episodes closer in time to when they were airing in the UK. Pre-series 5, the show aired on SyFy (instead of BBCAmerica where it moved for series 5 and beyond) and episodes aired at least 3 months after they aired in the UK.

&gt;

&gt;""__The Satan Pit__"" is the ninth [episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [second season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_2\)) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. It is the second part of a two-part story, following ""[The Impossible Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Planet)"". With the TARDIS seemingly lost, Rose and the remaining humans are trapped on the base with the possessed [Ood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ood), while the planet floats helplessly towards a [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole). Meanwhile, the Doctor is about to discover exactly what ""Beast"" is trapped in the heart of the impossible planet.

&gt;The episode was first broadcast on 10 June 2006.

Therefore it is cheaper to ship it even from far, far away places. It might be surprising but it is true - the energy companies aren't importing it just to fuck over the NUM - it's just cheaper.

The forces of globalisation and an ever-shrinking world would have caused the mine closures regardless of the government in power.

The effects of the decline in the mining industry on the mining towns were regrettable but just as inevitable as those caused by the decline in shipbuilding and manufacturing to places like Glasgow and Birmingham which used to rival London in wealth.

The fact is that the industries and centres of commerce of the nation are continually changing and moving with the times and this is due to economic forces far beyond the control of a few politicians.

We have endured a few tough years, but we have the potential to challenge at the top again in the future. Off the pitch the club is now financially stable and we have top class infrastructure. We have a great stadium, top training facilities, big fanbase, central location and huge potential for domestic and overseas expansion.


The main reason Randy Lerner failed to take Villa back to the Champions League wasn't a lack of money, it was a lack of football knowledge within the club and people that could adequately advise him. 


Lerner is now looking to sell but is still trying to improve the club as he looks for a buyer. We've just appointed a new CEO with a great CV after a successful time at Arsenal and I doubt he would be here if he didn't see a future for himself at the club beyond Lerner. If we can get a new owner with enough financial clout and more importantly an understanding of how to structure a football club for success, we will have plenty to be excited about.


If you want an American perspective, there is the [7500 to Holte](http://7500toholte.sbnation.com/) blog that covers all aspects of Villa. The founding writers are all American and could help explain why they originally chose Villa and what has kept them hooked ever since!

true,cock_blockula,null,null,"&gt; Scotland, all 5 million of them, would be our second largest trading partner? Please provide source.

Yeah it dies sound a bit odd but Scotland would be the UK's closest neighbour and the market between Scotland and the rest of the UK doesn't suffer from border effects anywhere close to those experienced by all other trading partners especially those outside the EU. The source is the fiscal commision used by Scottish government in its consultation on independence. I assume they are the only ones who have bothered to collate this data as it is fairly meaningless outside of the indyref debate. From memory it is somewhere around 10% of rUK's trade.

&gt; And if Europe being our largest trading partner by far wasn't enough to make us consider currency union why the fuck would the relative minnow that is Scotland be any different?

By not entering a currency union transaction costs which are not currently present will be introduced these will not be insignificant and will not be beneficial to most businesses. This will lead to border effects in what is already a fully integrated market and would be a backwards step for both sides in terms of trade. 

&gt; Can't we also tax them?

Not if both nations are in the EU. The transaction costs suggested are due to having to deal with 2 currencies as opposed to one.

&gt; There is no guarantee that they will be taken into Europe.

There is no definitive evidence either way some experts have said Scotland will breeze in others say it may be a bit more complicated and could take a couple of years. Either way the UK government had the chance to clarify the EU issue but refused to. This is quite telling as if they really expected Scotland would be shut out they would have gone ahead and got clarification as it would have pretty much guaranteed a No vote. I don't think we will see a situation where a country comprised of EU citizens and complies with all EU laws and directives is not part of the EU. There is no precedent for Scotland's situation like there was no precedent for East Germany but a pragmatic solution was found I don't see why Scotland won't be similar. The worst case scenario I see is Scotland being a member of the EEA whilst negotiations on EU terms is completed, if it is not done so before the date of independence as this way there is minimum disruption to trade.

&gt; Where are all their subsidies to come from if not us (and don't for one second try and claim that they aren't subsidised by the rest of the UK)

This is a myth I'm not going to bother with, even Better Together have stopped peddling it. I suppose the answer you're looking for is that the UK (including Scotland) has been subsidised by debt. The percentage Scotland puts in is slightly less (generally) than the percentage it gets back.

&gt; Well what is to stop the UK simply making taking on their share of the National debt a condition of letting them go? 

Its in no ones interests to take negotiations to the extreme, the damage it would do to the economy of the UK is worse than anything the Scottish government is proposing. Pragmatism will win over as the UK is not going to risk taking itself back into recession when it doesn't have to. Any argument that Scotland would inevitably get screwed over more whilst true doesn't make it a good idea for the UK to sabotage its own economy and international reputation. The EU, UN, international markets etc won't reward the UK for taking punitive actions against its second largest trading partner.",0,1410132545,null,0,1410132796,0,ckc08bi,t3_2fpk5s,t1_ckc08bi,t1_ckbyttk,null,1427136401,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Murumasa,eng-middlesex,Middlesex,"Really it comes down to one question: Do you believe a central government should be in control or should the limitations imposed by governments be minimised?

Currently both Labour and the Conservatives to varying degrees support the neo-liberal ideology prevalent in Reaganomics/Thatcherite economics, that the market is best left alone and as free as possible from regulation by government. They argue that it stifles expansion in the market and the general public piggyback on the market for their increasingly positive way of life.

Personally I find it naive, offensive and needs to be expunged from politics. It leads to nepotism and cronyism in the market and politics, the destruction of public services to be replaced with more expensive natural monopolies with inferior service, a stark rise in inequality and further harm caused by market falls in which businesses do not pay but the general public does. 

Like communism in theory it is a good idea, a market free from intervention all competing to give the best price and option to the consumer. But like communism in practice it doesn't work, not to mention that; A-We are not consumers, we are the general public and at least politicians are accountable when cooperation's arnt, and B- Without regulation the powerful don't dissipate power they hoard it becoming more untouchable in the process.

In terms of the NHS take it from someone whose family has worked within social work and health care for decades. It is being stripped bare, services are suffering and  people are going to be harmed and die as a result. If we do nothing to protect it now it'll be harder if not impossible to bring it back from nothing.

Also, no makeup collection is worth its while without a decent set of makeup brushes. [Real Techniques](http://www.boots.com/en/Real-Techniques-Mini-Brush-Set_1457832/) are good, but I equally like [Ecotools](http://www.boots.com/en/EcoTools-Bamboo-6-Piece-Eye-Brush-Set_1211196/).

So, American audiences, British Audiences, and other audiences can discuss the episodes with each other on the same day instead of months apart. This increases the buzz around the series and thus the chances more people will watch it.

You are entitled to your opinion about Moffat, however I can't agree. Do I think he is better than Davies? Marginally. They are completely different and are hard to compare. They have their strengths and weaknesses and they are different in both.

The problem now is as stated in the linked article- the British are saying that the security and policing around Calais needs to be strengthened by the French to prevent this. The French are unwilling to pay to do so, saying it's the fault of Britain's immigration policy which is attracting the migrants there in the first place, so the British should be responsible for it.

As the two states diverge further over the coming years, I fear that more of the commonalities that we currently take for granted will be split. 

Obviously Scottish independence isn't going to result in Hadrian's Wall being rebuilt, but independence will naturally engender thoughts of independence: Scotland is going to be seen in a more critical light as a separate sovereign entity and isn't going to get the automatic support of the rUK on the world stage.

That would take a huge resource of knowledge. 

Stop reading the news. Read New Scientist, go work for a local charity, walk around any of the amazing parks that are free, the world leading art galleries, the world leading universities, museums and public spaces our tax pays for knowing that if you break your leg a free ambulance will come get you and spend tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds to heal you and only ask you cover a few quid towards costs, whilst you sit knowing that war isn't coming, anarchy isn't around the corner and mass death and starvation are for older generations to frown about.

Reading your post I don't get the sense you know the answer to that question. Answering it can be hard, especially when young, but you need to know what you are aiming for instead of merely having the 'Goal' of 'I want out'. Otherwise you can wind up drifting somewhere worse. It's also far easier to know what way to spin your CV, previous experiences, who to approach etc when you've a set role in mind.

In the mean time, I'd consider meeting your companies HR, telling them you are eager to start advancing your career and asking them what opportunities are available internally. They may very well have openings for team leads and/or management training available, or maybe even other opportunities. HR are (usually) eager to prove that they promote and train internally, so make it easy for them by stepping forward.

The suggestion re: managed services is also a decent one - there is usually better chance of progression and a better range of training available at said jobs. Plenty of places locally do those type of jobs - Capita Managed IT solutions (formerly Northgate), Fujitsu, Novosco, BT Ireland Managed Services, AllState/Northbrook.

For Scotland: More autonomy is *always* a good thing. We're starting to realize this now which is why we are trying to devolve more powers to local government and get more back from Brussels. If you're interested in why this idea is true I recommend any of Noam Chomsky's books on the matter. He also did a 30 minute issue on specifically the UK/Scotland - [see here](http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2014/09/06/noam-chomsky-on-scottish-independence-statehood-and-power/)

For UK: Presently, the economic relationship between the UK and Scotland is very unfair. 

(1) A formula dictates how much money each member of the UK gets. Scotland receives more per person than *any* other and it gets to decide where this money goes. This means that people on the English side of the boarder have to pay tuition fees and for care when they're elderly/sick whilst those in Scotland do not. 

(2) I think its ridiculously unfair that Scottish MPs get to vote on English taxes/spending when English MPs can't do the same (because there is no English Parliament so any directives go through Westminster which means members from all over the UK get to vote on English directives but they can't do the same). This is why I support (1) an English Parliament and (2) an end to political union between the four countries of the nature it is currently in.

(3) Scotland is expensive. As a net average it takes more money person from the government than any other nation in the Union. 

(4) There is a disproportionate distribution of people in the UK. Most people live in England which means it gets the most MPs. However, England still has fewer MPs per person than *any* of the other nations.  The Coalition tried to fix this by redistributing MPs more fairly, but this was stopped because (1) it would mean Labour lost their unfair advantage and (2) Wales, Scotland and NI would have reduced representation. The best way to fix this problem for all sides is to give complete autonomy to each nation so they can each govern their own elections. 

These are my reasons for why, as a Non-Scot, 100% support Independence.   ",0,1410134361,null,0,1410134604,0,ckc1052,t3_2fr7sb,t1_ckc1052,t1_ckc0n5v,null,1427135964,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Not to mention Negredo arrived when Pelle was appointed as head coach. 

#2. We didn't sign a replacement. City's transfer philosophy is to get business done early on and efficiently. Since we did not sign a striker, it most likely means his exit was not foreseen. Meaning we wanted to keep him. 

These two reasons alone make me believe there is something we don't know as fans. And this usually means it was a personal issue.

Season 5 was about Amy growing up and settling down and Rory standing up for himself and those around him.

In the finale, Amy suddenly had her parents come back. For humans this would be a big deal but did this change her life in anyway that we saw on screen? Nope. 

In the mid season finale (before it went off for the summer) Amy discovered that she couldn't have another child, her child was stolen, her baby melted in her arms, and her kid would grow up to be a woman who alternates between loving and trying to kill her best friend who she used to have a crush on and had abandonment issues towards. For most people this would be a pretty major deal. 

When the show came back after months, we got the BS of Amy and Rory having a secret childhood friend who they never mentioned who also turned out to be their child and then after all of this.... nothing changed. All of this was barely mentioned again. The characters completely stalled. 

Like wise with the Doctor we had a massive build up of him coming to terms with his own death. Did this have any pay off? nope. 

Now let's go to season 7, in the premier Amy and Rory suddenly remembered all of the stuff that they went through and we were handed a lazy divorce plot. Rather than treating this as a major chance to have an emotionally resonant and meaningful story with these characters we are supposedly attached to,  almost the entire divorce plot happens off screen and then is magically resolved by the end of the episode. 

Meanwhile, the Doctor in the season 6 finale was faced the the consequences of his actions... from now on he had to go more under the radar and keep the fact that he survived a secret. Did this revelation change his actions or the direction of his character at all? OF COURSE NOT

Does he learn and grow from the fact that the universe has almost been destroyed in an effort to kill him in the last two seasons? NOPE!

Now, Amy and Rory finally left after completely stalling in character development for a season and half and we get Clara.

Specifically we get the ""Doctor on the cloud"" and hiding away from humanity bit. Now this is supposedly a big character point, the Doctor is super sad and trying not to go have adventures now. Do we see any of that sadness come through in his actions? Not really, he just lives on a cloud now and Vastra keeps telling us how sad he is. 

 After this, at long last, we have Clara. Now season 7 and season 8 Clara are quite different. Season 7 Clara was completely 1 dimensional, just a prop there to look cute and be mysterious and have a slight crush on the Doctor. See if you can find a single point in season 7 where her character reacts to something and moves the plot forward because of her actual personality.",0,1410135237,null,0,1410135511,0,ckc1dfu,t3_2fr1na,t1_ckc1dfu,t1_ckc0hho,null,1427135754,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

I don't mean to be funny, but they really haven't. From my stance on the matter it would have been good if this was true. But the truth is the SNP has lied about *a lot* of the details of this split. I didn't think they needed to personally but they did.

&gt;I confidently predict that if there is a No vote then come next May many people in Scotland will be queing around the block to give the Scottish Labour party a kicking the likes of which it has never seen before.

Wasn't this meant to be a letter to England? Zzzz

&gt;I have sympathy for what you are going through right now. I can already see the reactions of the rest of the UK conforming to the classic 5 stages of grief model

**Facedesk** I must have my head in the sand or something. I'm not seeing it. Probably because much of England, unlike the writer of this awful article, has accepted the fact it will almost certainly be a 'No' vote (unfortunately).

&gt;Anger is a natural reaction and I don’t blame people for feeling it. Rejection hurts, but I’ll say it once again – this is not about you it’s about us.

&gt; leaking radiation made the plants grow?

Doctor Who is often filled with lots of exotic, nonexistant types of radiation, but you don't have to go that far; look at the town of Pripyat (where Chernobyl went boom).  That place is a thriving forest right now.  Plants, to an extent, _love_ radiation, because they can take a lot of cellular damage without a problem, and because they can use beta rays in photosynthesis.

I was more annoyed with the idea that radiation would make the place sunnier.  If there's enough radiation around to prevent cloud formation, there's enough to kill everyone in a 3.78 mile radius - clouds usually form at around 20,000 feet, and enough energy to vaporize an entire cloud's depth of water is enough to vaporize a human's water within the same arc.

&gt; A gold (and thus soft) arrow being able to penetrate the stone that made up the ship

How about a gold (and thus, really heavy) arrow being shot with a single recurve bow at an accelerating ship that could be no less than 1,000 feet in the air and actually making it?  You couldn't do it with a normal arrow; a gold one would have a much shorter range.

&gt; The ship's problem being unable to reach escape velocity

That I'm not so concerned with; the Doctor was concerned they may not reach orbit (and therefore, explode close enough to harm people).

Because I don't feel the UK government represents its people, because I don't think that will change any time soon, because I think we are diverging politically and because I don't think Scotland is '*too wee, too shite*' to be a perfectly respectable, modern, small independent country. 

Will there be problems? Absolutely. They are part and parcel of standing on your own two feet but I think the Scottish people are as capable as anyone else to face those problems. I want us to decide for ourselves what we compromise. Maybe we won't get into NATO or won't get into the EU without the Euro, that's fine, at least *we* will be choosing how we deal with those problems.

It's not about *nationalism*, or think we're *better*, or *exceptonal*, or *anti-english*, or *socialist utopia* or any other absolute nonsense various parties have tried to smear on people like me. It's simply about democracy and self determination, when the chance comes along to snatch a bit more (and it's not under completely idiotic circumstances) then why not grasp it with both hands?

I think the Better Together campaign has shown quite clearly what the UK establishment thinks of the electorate. We're people to be talked *at*, people who should shut up and let our betters run affairs, people who are too stupid to know the dangers in our dreams, people who should just be happy with what we have.

Are YES/Salmond any better? No probably not but in an independent Scotland they wouldn't have their scapegoat Westminster and they would absolutely live and die by the will of the Scottish people. We can immediately get rid of Salmond if we want, we can give the job to anyone we want, hell we can give the Scottish Conservatives a bash.

We can't do that for Westminster, we're not really part of the decision, barely anyone in the UK is.

From what I've seen of Willy, he's fairly consistent but nothing special. Average Joe seems better than average Willy, but you're right that he's shown some worrying signs in the past. I think he's been decent in his three matches this season. The goal conceded to Liverpool was bad luck. 

We can debate the goal conceded to Stoke, but after rewatching it I think the fault for that goal is 90% on Kolarov and Fernandinho. It got to a 1 on 1 situation, Joe made himself big, and it's really unfortunate that the ball went through his legs. There's not a whole lot different he could have done.

The American Revolution and this current vote - yeah, that's right, it is a *vote*, isn't it?! - are so much more different than you claim.

In case you didn't notice, there's a fucking *ocean* between the United States and Britain. In 1776, that meant months for every single little order or piece of correspondence to pass from king to subjects. And also, the colonists were ruled by a king, whose every word was law, period. The colonists had just got done fighting a proxy war with the French on behalf of the king, who decided then that even higher taxes were necessary as a result. In times of conflict, British soldiers could just walk into any American home and take it, claiming they needed to be sheltered.

Now, let's see the situation with Scotland: you can drive there from England. In a couple of hours. The Scottish get to participate in the democratic process, which you may recall, did not exist in 1776 for the colonists. Americans were being taxed without representation. The Scottish are not. The Scottish also did not just get done fighting a war overseas on England's behalf. And, as I said before, their independence will be decided *by a goddamn vote*. They don't have to fight a several years long war just to be able to have their own government.

Does that mean their complaints and reasons for wanting to leave are invalid? Quite probably not! But seeing as how you decided to be a cunt instead of answer my question, I don't know. And since you apparently can't tell the difference between this issue and the American revolution, I expect you probably aren't capable of understanding either issue at all.

Looking at Henderson's injury, it was the result of a tackle or avoiding a tackle, he turned his ankle to prevent being tackled. Some managers or coaches would **not** do contact training sessions the day before a match, though some would, it's not a contentious point to be honest. Unless the England players were diving into challenges recklessly, I think you can put this down to pure bad luck.

It's the Sturridge injury that annoys me, because it's a muscle injury in training, and players really should not be getting muscle injuries in training in this day and age. If they are, they're being overworked or it is poor methods. There is nothing unlucky about this type of injury in these circumstances, that's not me picking on Hodgson or the England medical staff, I'd be annoyed at Liverpool if we picked up silly muscle injuries in training.

Man United are a complete unknown for me at this point, but if they get their stars to all fire at the same time they will be in around those spots as well. Everton has done well but the jury is still out on how they will handle the extra Europa games, they are thin in a couple of positions there.

&gt;

&gt;""__The Unquiet Dead__"" is the third [episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [first series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_1\)) of the British [science-fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) programme *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, first broadcast on 9 April 2005 on [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One). It was written by [Mark Gatiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gatiss) and directed by [Euros Lyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euros_Lyn).

&gt;In the episode, alien time traveller [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Doctor) ([Christopher Eccleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Eccleston)) and his [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)) [Rose Tyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Tyler) ([Billie Piper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Piper)) travel to Victorian [Cardiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff) on Christmas, 1869 where there have been sightings of strange gas-like creatures. The Doctor and Rose team up with [Charles Dickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens) ([Simon Callow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Callow)) to investigate Mr Sneed ([Alan David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_David_(actor\))), a man who runs a [funeral parlour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_parlour) where it seems that corpses have come to life. It is revealed that the gaseous Gelth (voiced by Zoe Thorne) have entered Cardiff through a Rift, and wish to survive by taking over the corpses.

&gt;""The Unquiet Dead"" is the first episode of [the revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Doctor_Who#The_Ninth_Doctor) to be set in the past, and was intended to show the series' range. The original brief and script included a focus on [mediums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship) and was grimmer in tone, but it evolved into a story about zombies and became more of a ""romp"". Callow, who had researched Dickens as well as portraying him on multiple occasions, accepted to guest star in ""The Unquiet Dead"" because he felt the historical figure was written accurately. The episode also features a guest appearance by actress [Eve Myles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Myles); Myles would go on to play [Gwen Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Cooper) in the *Doctor Who* spin-off series *[Torchwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood)* from 2006. As contemporary Cardiff, location of the *Doctor Who* production, did not have enough Victorian architecture, the episode was filmed in [Swansea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea). [Computer generated imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_generated_imagery) (CGI) was used as the main visual effect for the Gelth. ""The Unquiet Dead"" was seen by 8.86 million viewers in the United Kingdom on first broadcast. It attracted generally positive reception, although some reviewers criticised some plot points and lack of moral dilemma. In addition, *Doctor Who* spin-off author [Lawrence Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Miles) accused the episode of having a [xenophobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobic) subtext, which caused a controversy.

As you said, messed up physics, plus confusion on what the actual plot was- Clara wanted to meet Robin Hood, somehow immediately run into him after the Doctor saying they didn't even know the decade for sure (okay, it could be that the TARDIS is smart, and got them there), then the Doctor and Robin have the whole macho fight over Clara (which was passed of as the Doctor being mad at Robin for existing, but there was clearly a dominance-battle undercurrent), then they try to stop the ship from taking off, but after killing the Sheriff instead just get the heck off and let it fly off instead of trying again to take it down? Why and how did they get off exactly? (Don't remember the details from that bit.) Then apparently through the 3's teamwork, they manage to shoot this heavy, unbalanced arrow 1000+ feet at a quickly moving target, which somehow lodges into stone/metal and helps activate a computer which previously needed specially shaped components to work, and it's not even near the computer? What? And when did the Doctor have time to go and get Maid Marian and bring her to Robin?

Also, why did the robots blow the door off its hinges in the spaceship's control room? The Doctor and Robin got in there fine, and I don't remember them locking it. And even if they had, wouldn't the Sheriff/the robots have a key? 

Also, what was up with the Promised Land reference? They didn't explain that very well.

All we can say definitively is that Munir is getting a lot more opportunities to showcase himself and has grabbed his chances and made the most out of them.

Baker hasn't got the same opportunities and for that reason we can only speculate on who is better. That being said, Barcelona's academy and team strucutre is always going to blow ours in the water when you compare our youngsters. Barca will always always give youth a proper chance to shine and put a lot of confidence in them. We don't, and even if you impress all we will do is loan you out. For example, Marca Bartra, a relatively average CB as far as talented youth players go, got 100x better opportunity than any of our young CBs, all of which are probably better than Bartra.

The best of the best young players thrive on game time. Munir looks like he is in the category, same with Baker though. If Munir gets to actually have a chance of playing then he can improve at a dramatic pace, but if Baker can never leave the bench than Munir will leave him in the dust. A lot of talented young players only need a small run of games to really prove how good they are, Sterling, Januzaj, Varane, Pogba,etc. All those players were just talented youth players until they got their opportunities, each one was practically a first team player right after their breakout season.

**TLDR**: First team opportunities is the only thing that can truly make a youth player breakout of their shell.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Regarding the Southampton goal, you don't even have to take it from me, watch Monday Night Football for that week and Carra and Neville are both in agreeance that Lovren was very much at fault for that goal. First City goal he is out of position, in the same way he was vs. Saints, being far to central and then he puts a weak header along our own box. He is certainly at fault there. Second goal is difficult like you say since it was the entire backline but he is too high with respect to the ball position and doesn't recover sufficiently. He is at least partly at fault for the goal but again is not the only player guilty in this instance. Finally about the Spurs game, I honestly can't believe you haven't picked up on his missed tackles and errors. Off the top of my head I remember him gifting Spurs their two best chances and giving them at least three openings from missed tackles (on the right touchline covering at RB twice in particular in that second half) and poor passes. Claiming Lovren was brilliant tackling in that game pretty much tells me you've let confirmation bias dictate your thoughts because it's an absolute fact there we blatant and frequent mistakes on his part during the game. Listen to The Anfield Index and they'll point out his shortcomings and it's mentioned on the times podcast and TAW also. I'm disappointed in him only because I have such high expectations of him; his talent is there for all to see but he has been far too hit and miss so far. He hasn't been terrible by any means, but he also hasn't been brilliant like you confusingly seem to have concluded. The fact you've overlooked his errors vs. Spurs and aren't willing to admit this tells me we really aren't going to get anywhere with this so I'll leave it there.

Sorry to say this, but the right wing are fiscally prudent as opposed to the left, who'll just borrow, tax the shit out of anybody who works hard and smile and then blame the right, or the English or anybody else when it goes tits up.

Capaldi has made the point both in and out of the show that he doesn't want Clara to be his girlfriend. He is actively distancing himself from her, in a way, and since the companion functions with the Doctor often in a similar (though perhaps somewhat more familiar) way as the audience does, this could leave some fans not liking the new direction, because they have less ""intimacy"" with the Doctor (plus, he's new).

true,Skywolf111,null,null,"Okay, I figure this will get buried because I'm a little late to the game but no one seems to have covered it yet so I'm going to try and lay down a little theory in having about series 8 so far. Things are not behaving like they should in this season and I think it's intentional.

In the episode Deep Breath the sonic screw driver was able zap the reign out of strax's hands (I may be remember the person wrong). This and the sonic screwdriver blowing up the archery target in this episode are things that the screw driver should not be able to do. 

More subtle, in the episode i""nto the Dalek"" just as the are being shrunk Clara says ""I don't believe this is happening."" And the doctor says something like ""no I don't believe it either"" it was the emphasis on this line that caught my attention. 

In this episode it was the most noticeable. Robin Hood isn't a real character and even the doctor noticed that things weren't right but upon discovering the robots he kind of forgot about the bigger picture. 

The second common thread of each episode is the revisiting of the past. In deep breath the doctor pointed out the congruence to the episode ""girl in the fireplace"". ""Into the Dalek"" mirrors aspects of ""asylum of the daleks"" putting Clara inside the head of a Dalek and the whole mentioning of ""duplicates"" this Robin Hood episode had parallels to ""the fires of Pompeii"" as the alien race or robots were making what looked like giant circuits board to get back to their home planet.   

We know that Mofatt likes to link all of the episodes of a season to some greater scheme, we know from the previews of the season that the doctor is going to deal with the ""mistakes"" of his past, we know Mofatt has said in interviews that we are going to learn why Capaldi was in the fires of Pompeii  and we know that the woman at the end of ""deep breath"" and ""into the Dalek"" is behind something. She is providing/manufacturing some sort of paradise/heaven for enemies that die during encounters of the doctor. And though we didn't see him arrive I bet the sheriff made it to paradise himself  But I think she may be manufacturing the adventures of the doctor as well.

true,ComradeNikolay,null,null,"why even bother arguing this point. Lovren came in and immediately won over a ton of fans that will ignore his blatant errors on the field and hail him as our best defender. It's sad really, because it's so obvious how mediocre of a CB he is. Did you see him at the WC for Croatia? All but one of Crotia's conceded goals was his fault. Him at right sided centre-back will not work. At Lyon he played on the right side about 10-12 times and was abysmal every game there. During his time in France, he was consistently put in the worst team of the week in one of the French papers (L'equipe I think). 

I feel like when it comes to defense most people only see slide tackles and miss the more important aspects, such as positioning. His positioning has been absolutely terrible all season. He chases down defenders that other players are marking and would leave the other CB alone to defend the entire backfield. Every single gamble that is presented to him he takes, and it almost always leads to a break for the opposition. I have no idea why he was brought in, I don't see a defender in him. The whole ""vocal/leader"" stuff does my head in as well. He points and  yells, so what? Who would want to follow this guy that makes error after error? 

Finally, we have Sakho, the best CB in our team. Sakho, a left sided CB. He didn't need replacing. If anything a complementary right sided CB should have been brought in to build a partnership w/Sakho. 

I give it a couple of months, I think by then Rodgers will accept his mistake and bench Lovren. However, if he continues making errors at this pace, he could definitely lose his spot in weeks. 

I do enjoy how ""poor positioning"" is being dismissed as a ""blanket excuse"" though!

Donna Noble became ""the most important woman in all of creation"" as she saved all of reality from Davros and the Daleks due to her transformation into the ""DoctorDonna"".  Hell, even Jack Harkness became immortal because of Rose's absorption of the Time Vortex, so by association he was transformed by his contact with the Doctor as well.

If you think about it, Amy Pond was a victim of circumstance.  She happened to live where one of the cracks in time formed.  The Alliance created the Pandorica based on what they found in Amy's house.  She and Rory conceived a partial Time Lord as a result of having sex in the TARDIS.  So, all but her initial contact with the crack in time was as a result of her contact with the Doctor.  Hell, so was Clara's storyline!!!

For starters, three episodes is a very small sample size. I haven't loved any of the episodes this season so far, but at least for Robot of Sherwood, it was a nothing, filler episode that every season has. It's not unreasonable to hope that this season's quota of those kind of episodes just happens to be weighted towards the start of the season this time round. I could go into more detail about what I don't like, but it sounds like we're on the same page, more or less.

I also like most of the same type of episodes you've listed there (nothing overly controversial there though ;) ). I've definitely noticed the more straightforward, 'old-school' vibe of this season, and while it definitely makes a nice change, I for one am hoping for a happy medium between high-polish, labyrinthine 11 stories and the more straight-up 12 adventures we've seen so far (and the magic of Moffat's 9/10 eps, of course). Again, it's too early to judge the overall tone of the series (even if we can make some good guesses).

On Capaldi in particular, while a lot of the characterisation and dialogue has been clunky, I've seen flashes of enough to make me confident that the character will ""get there"". Again, tl;dr, three episodes. It's true that he hasn't come on as strongly as 10 in The Christmas Invasion and 11 in The Eleventh Hour, but it would be high praise indeed if he did!

Sorry to word vomit all that - in short, yes, I agree with a lot of what you've said (and am happy to hear something that's not just ""Doctor Who is camp and ridiculous, get used to it!""), but it's very early on in the piece. I'm in no danger of giving up - even in a worst-case scenario we always get two or three cracking episodes a season, even when expectations are low.

In most of your posts you come off as a raging asshole. If you are actually trying to convince people that you are right, or trying to get them to see a different side of an issue, you're going to fail nearly every time before you even get to the facts because your tone is so awful.

Here is a better way you could've written the post above: 

&gt; It can seem like Hodgson is over intense in the training, but remember that the national team has an entire training staff. There are doctors, trainers and people with degrees in nutrition and sports science overseeing the training of the players. I would trust them to train the players properly: do you have any sort of degree or specialized knowledge in this field that would lead you to believe otherwise?

&gt; There have also been a fair number of players hurt under Liverpool's stead. Enrique has been out forever, Markovic, Flanagan and Lallana missed parts of preseason training; Johnson, Moreno and Skrtel (Johnson most seriously) were injured in our game against City, and probably more that I can't think of right now. I think it is safer to blame some injuries on the inevitably of playing a contact sport, not on Roy Hodgson.

That's a lot nicer, and would maybe spur some good discussion.

If you are trying to be mean, get a rise out of people, or get all of your posts downvoted, then by all means ignore this and keep doing what you're doing.",0,1410153236,null,0,1410153426,0,ckc8w2c,t3_2frtzs,t1_ckc8w2c,t1_ckc86g3,null,1427131001,17,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,17

But i agree with you that the Angels just don't scare me.  They send you to a random point in the past.  It's not like they directly kill you, or even hurt you.  Yeah, you are removed from your life as you know it.  That would suck, never being able to see my kids again.  But, you're still alive.

I always thought that the concept of the Angels was weak.  They basically ""create"" energy.  Because they rob you of all the potential energy of your life, but you still live it elsewhen.  They would be more terrifying if they made it so you were never born, and stole all that energy.  Or just outright killed you,  and lived off of your life energy.

true,Hirshologist,flair8,,"It's irrelevant what Mourinho said or didn't say or what Chelsea did or didn't do at the beginning of last year.  Romelu Lukaku at 20 years of age scored 15 goals over a period that included injury and led his team to a 5th place finish and record club point total.  That's a fact.  You can't honestly look at what he did last year and ignore it because on irrelevant tangential logic.  The kid has literally proven himself on the premier league pitch against the top levels of competition.
 
Benteke almost did leave last summer, but Aston Villa convinced him to stay.  He probably thought he could have gone to a higher level club after another good season.  He was probably right to.  We're quite fortunate he got hurt actually.  As long as he comes back healthy before the winter deadline, I think we have a realistic shot of signing him, especially since Arsenal just spent money on Welbeck.  

Finding a striker is hard.  They just don't go on trees.  We already fucked up once with a foreign striker.  In Benteke and Bony, we have a realistic shot at signing strikers who have **proven** themselves in this league against the same competition Soldado has failed to perform against.  

Sure, it would be fantastic if we can find that special striker that no ones heard of, but thats like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  I'd rather us get one of these two men who shouldn't be too expensive and are quality enough to help us move forward.  

Injury is certainly a concern with Benteke.  If it comes down to it, our medical staff will be put to task to make the right decision.  But as far as talent, both strikers have proven themselves in the Premier League as quality talents who would improve our team. 

You said Bony was awful and I reacted to that.  And honestly, 2 goals in 3 games is probably better than average.  ",0,1410155739,null,0,false,0,ckc9mjl,t3_2fofdy,t1_ckc9mjl,t1_ckbecq8,null,1427130521,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Clearly you need SOME sort of standardised testing to rank people and differentiate the successful from unsuccessful. I don't think we do too badly actually.

Their classes consist of memorising huge chunks of texts and being able to recite things.

true,thousandfaced,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"I don't think a new voting system in the UK is inevitable at all. 67.9% of the electorate voted against the introduction of the Alternative Vote. Labour and the Tories have absolutely no incentive to offer a change in future and the Lib Dems are as good as dead. Therefore the only hope for any electoral reform lies with UKIP. I won't support them and in any event I foresee the Conservative Party drifting right to appease potential UKIP supporters, thereby closing off this opportunity.

That is not to ignore the ability for people to exert pressure on the Government to change the system. However, when a fully functional, proportionally representative Scottish Parliament is already in operation, surely you can see why I support giving more power to it first?

The abolition of tuition fees and prescriptions costs weren't automatically part of devolution. They are policies implemented by elected parties and were fully funded by the population based block grant given by Westminster. Scotland already contributes more to the UK treasury than it gets back. With control over our finances, tax raising powers and oil revenues I do not see why we couldn't pay our own way. For more on the economics I recommend reading this http://theweebluebook.com/economy.php

I'm not ideologically opposed to tax breaks for the rich to grow an economy. However tax breaks seem to be given while austerity measures are imposed and public services are eroded via privatisation. That's wrong-headed and disproportionately affects the poorest. The current situation also comes as a direct result of the Credit Crunch and sub-prime mortgage collapse. So austerity is imposed while banks deemed ""to big to fail"" were bailed out. For me, it shows Conservatives priorities is rich bankers over poorer workers and it's not nice.

I think it's more likely than you think that the NHS will be privatised or that we will leave the EU. For starters there are no plans to exempt the NHS from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership due to be agreed between the US and the EU. I recommend having a look at this article if you have the time http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/eu-us-free-trade-deal-ttip-transatlantic-trade-investment-partnership 

In addition, there is the argument that the NHS is a devolved issue in Scotland and we will not have to privatise in any event. But that ignores that we in Scotland pay our taxes to Westminster and then receive funding for our public services via the aforementioned block grant. If privatisation occurs across the rest of the UK, the equivalent amount for funding NHS Scotland will be removed from the block grant, effectively forcing cuts on other areas of public spending in Scotland. [Watch Jeane Freeman of Women for Independence give a reasonable account of this position to Andrew Neil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23m6CukRUGM).

On the EU, the Conservatives have already pledged an in/out referendum if they win the next General Election. Labour haven't pledged to hold a referendum or not but I feel they will lose the election if they do not. Then there is [this poll](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/21/eu-referendum-majority-leave-opinium-observer-poll) released by the Observer that said a clear majority wish to leave the EU. I don't want any of that to happen, and its perfectly likely events can change in this direction. Would you honestly have foreseen a poll saying 51% of Scots wish to leave the UK a year ago?

As I've said before I'm not a nationalist and so I have never voted for the SNP. However, I'm not prepared to vote for the Conservatives, Labour or the Liberal Democrats while they are tied to a broken system in London and there exists a chance to leave it. I've drifted to the Green Party who in Scotland form one of the three parties within the Yes Scotland camp. As I've said before, it's not about the SNP or Alex Salmond, it's about the self-determination of Scotland as a historic country within (or without) the United Kingdom.

Finally, on the viability of Scotland as an independent state. Scotland already holds 60% of the EU's conventional oil reserves and has been extracting them since 1979. On the other hand Ireland [found it's first oil reserve in 2012](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-17378943). There's 25 billion barrels of oil left in the North Sea reserves and potential reserves on the West Coast [untapped because of the presence of the Trident nuclear submarine base](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/trident-removal-may-allow-oil-and-gas-exploration-1-3241185). If we had have followed Norway's example we could have established an oil fund in 1990 that has [since made every Norwegian a potential millionaire](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101321953). Scotland also holds 25% of Europe's offshore wind resources allowing us to become a leader in renewables.

true,gomez12,null,null,"I don't think we are too bad or in need of a huge amount of fixing. That said, I would do a few general things:

Try to boost places aside from London. HS2 is a step in the right direction. Every country has a dominant city, and London isn't particular worse than Paris, Berlin or any other capital. However, it is causing problems. Internet infrastructure would help too. I'd also change legislation to encourage more employers to let people have flexible work hours or to work from home. This helps avoid rush hours, congestion, emissions, and enables people to live further from where they work - easing the crush in London and the crazy living costs there.

I would get fracking right now. It could provide jobs and money up North where it is needed. I'd put a chunk of profits into the local area (which I believe is already happening on a small scale), and a chunk into green energy as a ""sorry"" for the dirty gas. If we wait too long, the gas will be worthless. Also, this provides security for the UK to become more independent rather than buying gas from Qatar. We would even sell to Europe - and they would definitely prefer to buy from us than Russia. Short term, yes. But we can get some good out of this in the long run.

I would pour even more money into science, biotech and healthcare. The UK has some of the best in the world. Stem cell research at Cambridge and Imperial, Medicine at Oxford and London etc are all world-leading. We have pioneered so many new techniques and technologies here, we should be incredibly proud of it. We just unveiled a new DNA project too to sequence 100,000 genomes. That sort of stuff is awesome and will make a huge difference in 5-10 years time. We also have a small stem cell bank at Cambridge, and again we should expand that and make it the best in the world. We have the NHS - probably the largest patient sample in the world. I'd make a serious effort to centralise that data and open it up to computing analysis. That would be tremendously powerful for analysing health outcomes, risks and helping people prevent diseases. For example, we now know that lung cancer is AT LEAST 10 different diseases - all with different causes, mechanisms, progression and different optimal treatments. We finally have the technology and computing power to handle this stuff, so lets get mass profiling people. Massive public good and a huge return on investment for these projects IMO.

I would spend more money on defence. Again, we make some of the best stuff in the world, but we neglect it or do it in a half-arses way. The new destroyers impress the americans, but we only have 6 of them! New carriers are great, but we don't have any planes for them. New submarines are amazing too, but we only have 4-5. This money isn't taken into a field and burned - it's jobs for people in the UK - high tech jobs. Any idea how much design, science, engineering and manufacturing goes into making a new submarine engine? A shitload.

I would try to have a more fair immigration system based on peoples ties to the UK and their contribution, rather than one based on where they are from. 

I would try to be more ""hands off"" with regard to education and healthcare. I think we should trust that most teachers, doctors, nurses and administrators are decent people who care about their students/patients. Constant interference makes their lives worse and IMO doesn't really improve anything in terms of outcome.

I would try to improve government transparency, and try to engage the public more. People are disillusioned - particularly young people. But again, I believe most politicians are decent people who care about the country and care about the people in their constituency - however, we rarely see that. Politicians should do more AMA-type interactions. They should be contactable by smartphone apps. We should be more aware of what they are voting on and how they are making decisions. Politicians should justify their choices to us.

In terms of the economy, I would try to simplify benefits and reduce the amount of petty bullshit involved. We have to accept that some people are going to be lazy sponges, but that's the cost of doing business. You can't filter them all out, and it seems pointless to spend so much time and effort goading people into trying harder. As for NEETs and similar, I would make them do useful things in their community - whether picking up rubbish, painting over graffiti or whatever. It gives people purpose and reward, ties them to their community and gives them some experience too. I see nothing wrong with asking people to work in return for benefits. However, I would NOT allow Tesco etc to hire them for cheap. Government programs should not be supplying huge businesses with cheap labour and undermining actual paid employees.

And I know it's easy to say, but we really really should try to get people to pay the tax they should be paying in the country where they do business. I would make a push on an international level to get other countries to close up their laws. It seems mental that Amazon can ""base"" themselves in Ireland and not pay tax here. But the UK alone can't control that. We need co-operation from others. Granted the UK government are already doing this, but I fully support it.",0,1410158254,null,0,false,0,ckca91d,t3_2fs602,t1_ckca91d,t3_2fs602,null,1427130230,34,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,34

When companies sue governments in international arbitration tribunals, investment arbitrators have the power to divert taxpayers’ money to corporations.

**To put it simply, if a doctor is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company, we might question whether the medicine prescribed is the best for our health; if a public servant receives money from a lobbyist, we might question whether the policies they promote are in the public interest. In the same vein, if an arbitrator’s main source of income and career opportunities depends on the decision of companies to sue, we should wonder how impartial their decisions are**

Melvin J. Howard, an american who inherited everything from his parents, served Canada with a ""Notice of Intent"" on July 16, 2008, claiming USD $160 million.  The claim alleged the Canadian government amongst other things breached its obligations under NAFTA Article 1102, directly and through Canada’s municipalities and Provinces, by not providing the US investor through clear guidance from the Government of Canada with the best treatment available to US competitors in the monopoly health care services market

---

&gt;The Twelfth Doctor's clothes consist of a signature dark blue short [Crombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crombie_(clothing\)) style coat with red lining, harking back to [Jon Pertwee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Pertwee)'s [Third Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Doctor), dark blue trousers, a long collared white shirt buttoned to the top with no tie, a navy cardigan or waistcoat as well as [Dr. Martens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Martens) style Loake brogue boots. Throughout the series he varies his shirts from episode to episode, with navy and dark purple shirts appearing, as well as a black holey jumper, all being worn under his coat. The number of buttons done up on his coat varies in each episode. The look was created by Doctor Who costume designer Howard Burden.  His costume was described as ""No frills, no scarfs, no messing, just 100% rebel Time Lord.""  Capaldi said that the costume took a long time to find. The reason he settled on his final costume was because, “I think it’s quite a hard look. I always wanted him to be in black — I always just saw the Doctor in dark colours. Not tweed,"" in reference to his immediate predecessor's original costume. ""Matt’s a really young cool guy — he can wear anything, but I wanted to strip it back and be very stark.”  He also described it as ""back to basics.""  Moffat described the look as ""A stick-insect sort of thing"". He also said that Clara calls him ""a grey-haired stick-insect at one point"".  Capaldi also stated that he chose the Twelfth Doctor's costume so fans of the show who enjoy cosplay could easily emulate it without going to great expense.

Just look at the number of goal keepers who suddenly get a lot better into their 30's - their reactions didn't suddenly get better they were just better positioned to make the save.

Confidence is another big concern for me when it comes to Migs, if you notice in big games he always seems to be a little on edge.

And finally, I know you said you have only really seen that video of Valdes but just look at the number of times Valdes catches the ball.

true,EverythingIsByDesign,cnty-wales,Costa del Swan,"To me what the country needs is a complete overhaul of the political system. The population in my eyes is becoming completely disengaged with politics; in westminster we have punch and judy shows like PM questions and successive governments who fail to distinguish themselves from their predecessors. 

Whenever an election comes round leaders tend to spend more time pointing out what the other parties have or haven't done rather than what their parties policies are, all we get is he said she said campaigning from the major parties. In the grand schemes of things these parties have edged so far towards centre-ground politics that we have had a rise in radical parties like UKIP and BNP due to voters being disillusioned by ""mainstream"" politics.

Furthermore, our democracy is skewed by the fact there is not a level playing field, the exposure the big 3 parties get is huge when compared to fringe politics, they have bigger budgets and far more resources than an independant could ever dream of and they get more media time (even on neutral media like the BBC). The candidates they selected use campaign slogans like ""Your local voice"" (at least they do in Mid Wales) but when it comes down to voting in parliament they are nothing but puppets to the party whip; they don't to rebel for fear of alienation and deselection.

Which brings me to my final gripe, the obligation to follow party lines and not rattle cages stems from politicians fear of deslection because they view politics as a career. Career politicians are the scourge of modern politics, their biggest aim is getting elected again in 5 years time. They are picked by the party because they have worked for the party as researcher/campaigner and have never actually held a real world job, never been on benefits or never held industrial action. They have little real world experience and go for election by the age of 30 hoping to put in 3-5 terms before retiring because for some their earning potential far outstrips the outside world. They have more interest in personal development and being faithful to party politics than being true to democracy and making their own decisions.

I'm not sure what exactly needs to be done but it needs to be done fast, I would certainly put a cap on the number of terms a politician can serve. I would also fix the length of a term to prevent a government opportunistically asking for an election when they are popular in the polls. I would put strict restrictions on political donations and mandate that a percentage of any donation is taxed to a fund to aid independent candidates, because without them democracy is truly lost.

**Tl;Dr Politics is broken, too many career politicians afraid to rattle cages, too much power and exposure belonging to the big political parties, who are becoming increasingly the same and campaign by pointing out rival parties flaws rather than promoting their own.

true,mtempissmith,null,null,"From what I've seen of him I don't think he hated it but I do think he had differences of opinion with the BBC as to how he was expected to promote it. I get the idea listening to him that he just didn't really quite expect the frenzy and promotion that came with the job. All the fuss and expectations it took him aback and made him fear that maybe his other work might end up being eclipsed a bit by it. He was right because that did happen. The Doctor sort of took over there for a while in terms of his whole career and I don't think he seemed entirely comfortable with it. 

I think the character he liked playing and I think for the most part he enjoyed the fans themselves. He certainly is nice to most Who fans that he meets even now so whatever made him want to leave playing The Doctor behind certainly wasn't his dislike of the fans. I think it was about management, constant promotion and the job being a little more demanding of him personally and professionally than maybe he realized it would be. 

CE strikes me as more of a rather serious ensemble actor, as a character actor. He can do leads but mostly you see him doing more character parts. The Doctor is a HUGE lead to play, tons of pressure there, nearly all the time. As The Doctor the whole show rises or falls on you. That pressure, I don't think particularly suited him and I'm not too surprised he did opt out as it were before he got too entrenched into the role...

In an early interview Matt Smith said Tennant warned him it was a quote"" wild ride"" playing The Doctor. Tennant in turn got that speech apparently from Davison when he started. Hearing it, that's one thing. LIVING it I'm sure it's pretty amazing and not a bit scary. Not everybody likes living in a pressure cooker scenario for too long. CE probably thought he could handle it or didn't think it would be too bad. Apparently he couldn't and opted to bail rather than keep dealing with it all. 

I kind of wish he'd done at least two, three years. He was a good Doctor and it's sad that his tenure was so short but then again if he had not left we would not maybe have had Tennant and his Doctor I would not have missed for all the world.

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"Well for a start, there's no Villa fan bandwagon at the moment. The fanbase is a bit more ... not really ""passionate"" but we tend to have reasons that go beyond other teams. There's nothing ""sexy"" about Midlands football. There's no oomph that draws people in easily. We're salt of the Earth, hardworking football. We're kind of a throwback in that way, and I think if you want to experience football fandom without all the false glitz and glamour, you came to the right place.

See... Arsenal, Everton and Swansea have all experienced periods of relative success recently that have probably garnered them more attention than a team like Villa. Our location in England, as well as our generally mediocre performances in recent times have conspired to have us woefully undercovered in the media. You rarely hear praise for the club. We're seemingly always the underdogs. And we thrive on that. We grumble about it, but deep down, we love that everyone underestimates us. Deep down, we love that every time we beat a ""big"" team, there's shock because we're ""not supposed to"".

We're not like other clubs. We have a unique name, a near-unique fan culture, and a realistic view on where we stand. That's why we have famous fans like Tom Hanks and Prince William. We're the inoffensive choice. You won't alienate people by supporting Villa (except the comparatively tiny number of fans of other Midlands clubs) because we're seen as a middle-of-the-road, average team. That impression is false, and it's why we all have a chip on our shoulder. It's why it feels so damned good whenever we put one over on the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal or Man Utd. It's a massive ""fuck you"" to the favourites. It's a massive ""fuck you"" to everyone who doubts us. We live for that shit.

So if you want to support a team with a great history and the potential to repeat, a team which doesn't really have bandwagon fans who will abandon the team in a year, a team which might not give you as many reasons to cheer, but will make you cheer loudest. Villa are the right choice.

To think that either parties involved in something as historic and important as the United Kingdom will be affected positively for years after the change is foolish.There will be years of economic and political issues that are caused out of the results of the idiotic mix of Salmonds Narcissism and Nationalism. He originally wanted the Euro and now he wants to have the pound despite their being no chance of a currency union. However it is a British currency and if Scotland do not wish not remain part of Britain then it is not up for Scotland to decide. You can't demand all the benefits of the UK without being in the UK. Likewise the idea that Scotland will somehow magically absolve itself of its share of debt is another fantasy of the SNP. Successor states inherit the responsibilities of the former states under international law, an independent Scotland is no exception to the rule. 

You are correct that the Union depends on each party and  Westminster has graciously offered to grant whatever Scotland chooses, but don't think that destroying what took three centuries to build will be without consequences. Salmond will be long gone as a politician before Scotland sees anything positive out of voting yes.

There was just too much noise for a show about a man with a time traveling policebox. Half of everything that happened you just had to accept, because it wasn't explained propperly. (At least that's my personal opinion).

And he's obvious. Good example, the first episode of this season: how many times did they have to mention that the lesbian couple was lesbian? A simple ""I love you"", a quick shot of them holding hands and some subtle acting would've been enough. But I always feel like he thinks the viewers aren't paying attention or are just plain stupid. ""Do you see England? I put lesbian lovers on tv! Did you see?!""

At least Davies was more subtle at everything and that made it a smart show. Half of the entire reason the 'Rose + Doctor' thing was so heartbreaking is because they never really talked about it but it was sprinkled here and there into various scripts during the season. Plus adding some smart camera work that enhanced (by lack of a better word) the way they looked at each other, put the idea of them liking eachother already in your head before they even said a word. And tháts believable and smart for me. His episodes mostley explained everything well, and most of the time he let the viewers think for themselfs. And he nailed it so well that the campyness actually added a whole other vibe to. the show. 

And this is were Moffat just falls flat for me. He can't be subtle. He has to hit us over the head with so much stuff. Everything has to be said out loud.
And it's just lazy writing almost the entire season.

Now I'm not saying he's a bad filmmaker. I've seen Sherlock (even though that's a different beast). Not every episode he made was bad, there are some really good ones.

I would also seek a plebiscite on the EU - I am agnostic about it but I firmly believe that the gradual transfer of sovereignty to the EU through successive treaties cannot be done without consultation. having a straight up debate about the EU will draw alot of the poison that has dogged the issue in British public life.

A £30 phone contract when two partners are in work is hardly extravagant.  A landline (that is increasingly redundant) costs basically that. (I.e £15 rental and £10 fees) + minutes. Overall if they are only £130/mo down - that's a very small amount. If my partner or I lost a job, we'd be down more than that in council tax alone. 

OP said he lost his job. Unfortunate but not many people have months of savings tucked away, a phone is hardly a luxury or a 'think they need'. My phone is a the hub of my life, as it is for most people. 

Free cycle etc works OK, but when you have a young kid you need a lot of crap, and if you don't have a car, free cycle doesn't deliver.

Cutting bills works - but you can only do it a certain amount -+ you have to wait for renewals. 

IMO -and something often ignored is to increase income rather than reduce expenditure. Even working a few hours in a pub each week will do more than cutting - few quid off a bill. OP should really be devoting 100% to finding work, any work.

true,Taure,null,null,"1. Completely reform the tax system. I would create two new taxes: an NHS tax and a Pension tax. The NHS would now be funded not from the general tax pool but via its own tax, the same for pensions. I would then get rid of National Insurance and would cut VAT to 10%. I would lower corporation tax significantly to around 10%, but remove loopholes so that 10% actually got paid. These would encourage business and consumption which would raise employment and incomes. I would make income tax more progressive - have a bigger tax-free allowance, but also a higher rate of tax on high-level earners. The way to tackle inequality without harming the economy or public finances is to tax rich individuals, not business activity. Money in the hands of corporations gets invested, money in the hands of individuals gets secreted away.

2. Get serious about energy. I'd allow shale gas to be developed in the UK, as gas is a relatively clean stop-gap fuel source to bridge the gap to renewables, and would significantly boost UK energy independence and our economy. But I'd institute a special tax on revenues from shale gas, the proceeds of which went to investment in renewable energy: R&amp;D, mass installation of solar cells on houses, building of more windfarms. I'd also continue the current investment in nuclear power.

3. Get serious about antibiotic resistance. Pass strict laws governing the use of antibiotics.

4. Create incentives for property developers to increase the construction of new homes, but at a sustainable rate to avoid a crash in house prices. The aim is to make house prices level off, not fall. Once house prices are stable economic growth will slowly make them more affordable.

5. Do something to tackle the ""unpaid intern"" culture and create new routes into graduate employment.

6. Legalise cannabis and tax it.

7. Increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP and keep it there. I'd focus on a) maintaining nuclear deterrent b) defensive capabilities (i.e. a powerful airforce, a navy focused on defending UK and European waters) c) cyber security and intelligence. To pay for this I would scale back our ability to project force globally, focusing instead on European defence, including defence from Russia.

For instance look at the EU decision making process - the level of influence of the UK/France/Germany (and to some extent Italy/Spain) is vastly superior to smaller EU nations. Scotland is unlikely to have the same opt outs as the remaining UK. On a global level Scotland would also be excluded from G8, or UN security council. When discussions of great importance occur Scotland is unlikely to be in the room.

Scotland would also leave a medium to large economy (on a global scale) to become a small one. A lot of the success of Scotland comes through being connected to this economy - in my work in financial services a significant amount of insurance and legal business is processed through Scottish companies using Scottish law. This happens because in some areas it is beneficial to use a slightly different law within the same country. This is a boost to Scotland's prosperity which comes from being in the Union. 

Many of the great parts of national culture loved across Scotland, and fiercely debated in the independence, are products of the Union.

For too long parts of the UK have been marginalised to the benefit of London and the South-East. Westminster have failed to recognise the growing discontent outside the M25 and I don't buy into this sudden 'shock' swing towards Yes in Scotland. This has been a long time coming and it speaks volumes about the sheer incompetence of Westminster that they have failed to put Devo-max or viable Regional parliaments with real powers on the table. Not putting Devo-max in the Scottish referendum has proven to be a massive mistake. 

Undoubtedly Scottish independence will be painful for Wales in the short-term. 92% of Westminster will consist of English MPs. However, I think this will force the assembly to demand a gradual transfer of power to Cardiff where they can begin to tackle the massive infrastructural problems among others. I study in London and it is just depressing going back to North Wales to visit family. Wales doesn't even have a North-South railway for god's sake. I can't help but think that we have been treated unfairly.

I think a gradual approach to independence with Wales being able to tackle our own economic problems in our own best interests would be ideal.

I know many will disagree with me and I'm happy to discuss other opinions but Scottish independence might finally make Westminster realise that there is a lot more to the UK than just London. 

If countries like Latvia and Lithuania are independent are don't see why Scotland, and in turn Wales, can't be independent when we have more to offer. Wales needs some self-belief. I think Scotland will do brilliantly as an independent country and it is about time that Wales starts to have a healthy debate about what we need to do next.

true,t_bagger,eng-nottinghamshire,East Midlands,"&gt;My decision will be based off hope for the future not fear of the unknown.

I find it genuinely scary that so many people are voting 'Yes' out of what's effectively *blind hope*. I really do not have a problem with Scotland seceding from the union if that's what her people so wish, however I would be more comfortable if that decision was based upon a clear plan of how an independent Scotland would a) break away from the United Kingdom and with what ""assets"", and b) function politically and economically once a sovereign state.

As things stand a lot of important decisions have not yet been finalised, and the negotiations wont take place until *after* the referendum is a done deal. It's worrying that people are being forced to make such a huge decision without knowing how those negotiations are going to pan out beforehand. Assume you vote 'Yes' in the *hope* that everything is going to work out exactly how the SNP promised, but the negotiations do not go in Scotland favour. What then? There's no going back.

Maybe it'll work out. But with so many unknowns, maybe it wont. It's a horrifying prospect that you're being asked to put so much trust in the vague promises made by the Yes campaign, and I don't envy you having to make that choice when there's just not enough information on what *will* happen to make an informed decision.",0,1410167361,null,0,false,0,ckcbygz,t3_2fshwn,t1_ckcbygz,t3_2fshwn,null,1427129115,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,codeduck,southafrica,Saffer at large,"1.   More spending on the armed forces.  Given the current state of the world, downsizing does not make sense.  Additional purchase of Eurofighters, modernising and upgrading of the Tornadoes.   We're unfortunately tied to the F-35 so we can't cut that without rendering our carriers useless, but we need more missile cruisers and frigates.  Reopen some mothballed shipyards and build some sweet-ass ships.
2.   More spending on rail infrastructure between smaller cities / towns, and upgrades to major trunk lines.  Rail is ridiculously expensive.  Giving people more mobility will boost people's economic power.
3.   Strict, independent scrutiny for everyone in public office - if you are in public office and even suspected of impropriety you are suspended on three-quarter pay while an independent organisation investigates you.  This carries for everyone up to and including the Prime Minister.  Holders of public office must realise that they are custodians of the country, not princes.  It is their DUTY to run the country well; being in public office is not a free ticket to the best place at the trough.
4.   Additional income tax relief for people earning under £40k a year.
5.   Additional surcharges on high-end luxury goods to help fund social upliftment programs.  Want that Maseratti?  
6.   Strict legislative controls on the activity of religious organisations.  Celebrate your faith by all means, but if you start advocating anything which goes against accepted behaviour in our society you're out.
7.   Strict penalties for violent behaviour or gang violence.
8.   The ability for a constituency to recall their elected member of parliament via a no-confidence vote.
9.   Levies on vacant property in high-population regions, and rent-controls to prevent people from being priced out of their homes.  
10. Stronger legislative protection for the existence of the NHS, coupled with a review of the NHS management structure.  Primary healthcare should be a basic right of any resident of the UK, and market forces should not be allowed to interfere with this.
11. Better funding for mental health research and support.  The UK has a high incidence of people with mental health issues and these people should be better looked after by our society.
12. Better management of the disability system.  It should not be run by commercial entities, it should be run by a non-profit, and that non-profit should be 
13. Better care for retirees.  The elderly get swept under the rug here; my view is that they've likely worked hard all their lives and a lot of them do not have much to show for it.  Increase the state pension for all retirees.
14. Additional funding for Biotech, Nanotech and high tech research and development.  We're doing well here, we should do better.  Qualified people should not face visa and immigration barriers.
15. Enaction of legislation that requires companies that operate in the UK to do so through a UK-registered company, and to pay company tax on all revenue earned within the UK.  Amazon, Google et al operate here, they should in turn pay their fair share.  
16. Tax evasion on UK earnings will become an extraditable offence in the United Kingdom.
17. Legalisation and taxation of the narcotics market.  I do not like drugs and ideally I'd prefer they did not exist, but people have a right to do to themselves what they want and I'd prefer 14 year old girls didn't die from bad Ecstasy.
18. Better oversight of the behaviour of the various police forces.  Police should be empowered to protect the civil populace, but any abuse of that power should be met with harsh sanctions against the officers involved and their chain of command.  The UK has one of the finest police forces in the world, I do not want to lose that, but I will not tolerate corruption in the police.  Ditto for the military and government.

There's other stuff I'd do that I can't think of right now, but they would all follow the following tenets:

1.  Strength at home through honourable behaviour towards the citizens of the United Kingdom.  People were once proud to be British and I would want them to be proud again - without the jingoistic, imperialistic asssociations of Empire.  People should be proud of the UK because it is a great country that comes together in bad times and looks after its own (and those who are unable to look after themselves), because they can be happy here, and because they know that if they are in trouble here there will be someone who can help them.
2.  Strength overseas through honourable behaviour towards allies and opponents.  No rendition, no torture, no flouting of the norms of international diplomacy.   People come to the UK because of the possibility of a better life.  I want them to come to the UK because they want to become British and make us even better.

Damnit, I need a gramophone and a recording of Pomp and Circumstance now.

The day Carra faulted him for the 3 goals, some on this sub have begun to change their tunes on Lovren. It's absolutely mind boggling that one ex player who was guilty of similar errors can play the pied-piper. Excellent defender Carra, but I really think he got it wrong with defending John Glenson and Skrtel. That analysis was of a defender who saw his style in those 2 players.

However what is more mind-boggling is how Sakho isnt considered as a good player here. I have seen some on this sub make the same beaten down statements that he looks off balance with the ball. People dont realize what being a captain at 23 at a club like PSG takes. And sadly, we will value him and miss him the day he decides he's had enough of being behind Skrtel. 

Agree about that back four. It looks perfectly balanced with pace, leadership, tackling ability, flair and aerial prowess. Reading of the game will come with age and experience. You dont become Paolo Maldini in one season.

I have to go and do some reading before I respond to some of your comments. I have serious doubts about currency union without political union as the Euro has shown that that is not a straightforward as it would have seemed a few years ago. 

Off the top of my head; if there is a fiscal crisis requiring the Bank of England or Treasury to pump money in then is England going to carry the burden unilaterally? If no is Scotland going to say yes to any terms the Band of England deems required, I can see that going down well with Scots. If not ss there going to be delay whilst England and Scotland negotiate the requirements and terms when delays in money markets can cost millions?

I've not been following the debate so didn't realise that the subsidisation point was considered invalid, I'll check it out but thank you for responding on it in a way that allows me to check it out.

As for the German / East German assimilation I do have some knowledge of that; the pragmatic decision of the German government to simply accept East German currency on a one to one parity with the Deutsche Mark led to almost a decade of very poor performance in the German economy and whilst they are now once again showing robust growth there are massively different structural differences at every level which have aided the German recovery. We do not have anywhere near the same type of economy.

She said it was the 'only way' to ensure she didn't have her benefits stripped away.

Every time she has a meeting with a medical professional now she stops taking her medicine 24-48 hours before so her symptoms are at their worse to get the most poorly points.

I've mixed feelings because her actions are clearly playing the system, but the system creates that much anxiety that this is the kind of thing some people are doing. It's not fraud either, it's just unethical.

She's still my friend though, but it's horrible seeing her go from the lovely, bubbly and beautiful 16 year old who had a managed health condition to a bitter, suspicious, angry and unwell 25 year old. I can't spend too much time with her because she's emotionally draining. She feels so battered by successive governments that she's basically turned on herself and almost seeks to make her situation worse to vindicate her view that the government(s) are monsters.

true,oreography,newzealand,New Zealand,"**IF I WAS THE PRIME MINISTER 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO**

* I would ensure all companies operating within the UK paid tax in the UK. If you left the EU some loopholes would be closed, but tax and trade laws would be reformed and ironclad. Perhaps introduce a flat corporate tax rate of 15-20% as they have in Hong Kong, making it simple for honest SMEs to operate within the UK. 

* All major British infrastructure should be nationalized. Companies can bid for contracts throughout the country but the rail lines, postal service, airports and ports will be owned by the state and run in co-operation with tendered companies and/or local government. 

* I would offer a referendum to commonwealth states if they wished to become a dominion within the Empire again. If Scotland gets to choose its stature within the commonwealth so should India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and all the rest. However as before there would be strict immigration policies, however those within the commonwealth would be prioritized similar to our current situation within the EU. To gain the benefits of joining the commonwealth, positions would be extended to various countries worldwide providing they recognize her majesty as the head of state and all other political and economic preconditions. Make the commonwealth significant, important and desirable and therefore increase the significance of the UK. 

* I would make Britain leave the EU but join the Schengen area as Norway does, as well as ensuring trade agreements are signed with the EU. Norway currently has to subscribe to EU trade regulations as does America and any other country wanting to do business with the EU.  That way Britain retains the greatest benefit of the EU without being subject to its laws and retains its sovereignty. Some immigration controls would have to be worked out though.

* I would offer benefits to British farmers and British industry. Strengthen inter commonwealth trade ties to depend less on china and creating a greater commonwealth trade market: Particularly among emerging markets such as India, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Malaysia as well as major members like Australia and Canada. Less developed commonwealth members particularly African states would see huge financial benefits and trade deals, improving the lives of their citizens. I would invest in high quality and sustainable industry in the North again such as Premium brand clothing and foodstuffs. Make the country more self sustainable and strengthen commonwealth ties through trade. 

* With the industrialization of the North, I would also invest more in Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and every other major city that isn't London. Offer incentives for businesses to move out of the capital through these investments. Create fast train links similar to in China and Japan between major British cities, reducing the commute time between major centres. An ultra fast train line starting in London and going all the way up to Edinburgh with others branching off it. London to Edinburgh in 3 hours by train! Beijing to Shandong is the same distance (430km) and it takes 3 hours by fast train. Look at developing an underground in Edinburgh and Birmingham. With improved transport links  we can make a truly united kingdom. 

* I would improve Britain's standing internationally. I would ensure the UK had the largest military within Europe and the second largest military force within NATO. I would conduct joint military exercises with India, Singapore, Australia and Canada to strengthen commonwealth defense ties. I would improve Britains diplomatic stature in the world, and  take a hard line particularly on Russia and China. I would intervene diplomatically over China breaching the joint declaration over Hong Kong, reducing trade with them and would pressure the international community to allow fair elections within the territory as was promised under a UN ratified treaty. I would also heavily sanction Russia over Ukraine and freeze assets of Russian citizens in London. Ensure that our threats are not without actions and we will gain respect in the world. 

* I would legalize gay marriage but offer exemption for any church including the Church of England for performing gay weddings. 

* I would take a hard line over hate speech, particularly in the Islamic community. Anyone found with material found hateful to sexes, races or religious minorities would be fined and if a repeat offender would potentially face a jail sentence. Anyone suspected of Terrorist activities would be detained, given a fair trial and if found guilty be deported or lose their citizenship. Anyone fighting a ""Jihad"" will be stripped of their citizenship. I would appoint police officers of the same ethnic background to investigate Muslim schools and mosques. Those found with incriminating materials will be shut down.

* For new immigrants I would ensure they meet a sufficient level of English proficiency before they enter the country. Those admitted on humanitarian grounds (And all immigrants except those sufficiently skilled) would follow an assimiliation program and be assigned case workers that introduce them to British culture and regularly check up on them. Upon leaving the EU I would clamp down on any newfound illegal immigrants, ensuring only skilled labour or those on commonwealth visas would be allowed within the UK. 

* I would also offer greater autonomy to Wales and Northern Ireland and Scotland.  I would introduce special Pound notes for Wales,Northern Island and possibly the channel islands and isle of man as Scotland has but ensure they are recognized in all corners of the country. I would ensure the treasury evenly distributed them throughout all banks in the country to minimize chance of forgery. 

* Finally and most importantly, I would badmouth France at press conferences and tut at their President over a cup of tea for no particular reason. ",0,1410168449,null,0,false,0,ckcc4iy,t3_2fs602,t1_ckcc4iy,t3_2fs602,null,1427129037,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The current iScotland proposal is for a single chamber.  This means that the elected party of the day can introduce sweeping changes that are more about the politics of the heart than the head.

Our current government swings from the benevolent grandfather giving us free University education and prescriptions.  However they also have this lofty belief they can control our personal habits. Smoking Bans, Alcohol Promotion bans, bans on football fans chanting.  

My view is that a second chamber is essential to moderate the excesses of a possible new government finding its way in the world.  If the vote is yes then the whole country needs to support the decision.

OK there will always be some on here commenting on entitled old men  sitting in the Lords claiming their £00's a day.

true,hildaoblivion,null,null,"Hi 

Im finding it a difficult decision but going for no - here is my Wall of Text reason.

For me the issue isnt that Scotland cant go it alone. If we already were separate we would be fine Im sure.

Its just that HOW to get there is fraught with risks. Not the risk of the unknown but the known risks we face but are NOT talking about. 

This is a really odd debate. 

Take the currency (I know, yawn).

IF we get a CU then we will STILL have English control over our spending and borrowing. What if a rabid Tory party cut public spending like mad in England and so the BoE demand we do the same? what do we do?

Its their currency, their debt and their central bank. Can we say no? Is that independence? Why arent we discussing this?


If we DONT get a currency union then SNP say we'll use the pound like panama uses the dollar. ""We can keep the pound!!!""

GREAT! Except that Panamas banks are not guaranteed, If they go bust you lose the money. They pay much higher interest rates for this risk. so do their borrowers.

Could our banks go bust? Well if you had money and could move it to an English bank you would do so - why take the risk?
And if many people do that POP there goes HBOS. And all the unguaranteed money in it.

That is a huge risk, Are we discussing it? Are people even aware?


Our govt will have to run debts 
If we are in a CU we'll need English permission. 
If we are not we will pay a LOT more interest till we get credibility (see Slovakia) with money markets.
 
Higher interest means lower services or higher taxes.

We are not discussing this.

I wont go into the Euro (as it would take years and what do we do in the meantime).

Our own currency IS what we need to do if we want independence. 
But really most people dont want the risks and costs it brings.
It never polls well.

So the SNP who want independence at all costs do NOT discuss any of this. 

And by not having a plan they cant be criticised and and can paint No as scaremongers and boring. Any raised risk is just slapped as fearmongering.

But if you are raising kids or have a mortgage or live on a fixed income this is REALLY important.

This doesnt even go into the EU and NHS grants that keep our research and education sectors going (go talk to you nearest Uni and see whos leaving).

It doesnt cover the financial services industry that will have to migrate down south. 90% of their clients are english and they wont want the risk associated with Scotland.

I could go on about the length of time the negotiations will take and the huge uncertainty that creates. (eg are our banks guaranteed if we havent agreed a CU yet? Does my mortgage go up? Can I get a mortgage in this time? Can I move house).


The problem is not CAN scotland go it alone - its about how to get there and if its worth the price and risk.

The SNP are NOT explaining that because they know they would lose. 

Better Together probably assume people are smart enough to figure it out.

That key conversation isnt happening. Its all 'the negativity of the the nos'. 

For the SNP and Salmond Independence is the finish line. 
For all the rest of us its the start of a lot of change and uncertainty and for what? 

If the SNP get their way its a CU which isnt even real independence.

Its DEvo-Max with a new flag and a LOT of risk. Is it worth it if new powers are on offer?

We can always vote again to leave later (when we beef up what we are voting for) - but we cant vote to get back in if this vague, fairweather plan doesnt work out.

PS - English dudes this doesnt even cover the cultural issues - I am scottish AND british. Its a huge complex decision. 

You say your decision will be based on hope for the future not fear of unknown. What about known risks? Or do you believe that all the risks are just made up?",0,1410168524,null,0,false,0,ckcc4z7,t3_2fshwn,t1_ckcc4z7,t3_2fshwn,null,1427129031,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

* **Nationalisation** - Trains, water, gas, electricity would all be renationalised. Communications and internet would be next. Obviously the NHS would remain or return to being publicly owned and run.

* **Infrastructure** - Increased investment in the renationalised railways and highways department, creating better transport links between places that aren't London. 

* **Close tax loopholes** - No more of this ""offshore for tax purposes"" bullshit. Raise the top rate of income tax.

* **Industry** - I think we need to shake Britain's reliance on The City and the finance industry. I would suggest tax breaks or government investment for new and growing industries such as software development and green energy.

* **Education** - scrap tuition fees. Mandatory languages education in primary schools. Earlier start on technology and engineering-related education (although I think some of that is already happening). Phase out faith schools.

* **Welfare** - immediately raise minimum wage to something liveable (£10-£12?), we need to tackle the amount of people who are employed but still in poverty. Scrap bedroom tax.

Aaand some more unusual ones:

* **Working Conditions** - Move to a four-day work week, spread over 7 days. Attempt to make working hours less uniform to alleviate congestion. Encourage telecommuting when and where possible and appropriate.

* **Minimum Income** - Consider replacing JSA etc with a citizen's income. It's an interesting idea that seems to be getting a lot of publicity lately. It'd be interesting to see how much it would save in administration alone, and whether the claims about it causing inflation or not are correct.

* **Reform Parliament** - Elected house of lords. Ban on second and third jobs for MP's. Proportional representation. Provide more autonomy and power to local government/councils to deal with local issues themselves. Provide a mechanism for the community to recall MPs - admittedly this would be tricky with a PR voting system, but I'm sure there's some way it could be done.",0,1410169421,null,0,false,0,ckcca40,t3_2fs602,t1_ckcca40,t3_2fs602,null,1427128964,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"The problem is that while there are plenty of jobs that plenty of disabled people would be perfectly capable of doing, there is no incentive for companies to take them on. When presented with the choice between a disabled person and a not currently disabled person (chances are we'll all be in some way disabled at some stage), employers will tend to look at the costs and effort required to take on a disabled person and rule it out in favour of the ""easy"" option.  

Obviously they cannot legally refuse someone employment on grounds of disability, but given how difficult it would be to prove that they had done so, this legislation has very little effect. 

It's a sorry state of affairs, but I doubt there would ever really be much change in this area unless it were actually beneficial to a company for them to hire a disabled candidate. I don't think that just evening it out (i.e. covering the costs to the employer) would do the trick as there would still be more hassle involved. Trouble is that then, of course, you might find that companies here people simply *because* they are disabled. It would need a fine balance to ensure a level playing field. 

In your example, your blind man is obviously deserving of respect, but I don't think it is a minority of disabled people who are willing and trying to work. He is just one of the lucky ones who found someone willing to give him a job. 

Don't forget, though, that there are also plenty of disabled people for whom work of any sort is simply not an option and those people need our support.

Those that do end up fighting have normally broken away from the mainstream of jihadis and set up their own militias who are little more than criminal gangs, looting and pillaging just to survive.

**Tony Evans piece here:**  

“WE’RE not English we are Scouse!”

It’s the chant that irritates opposing fans more than any other.

You can see the bewilderment; the disgust. You can almost see the thought process: “What makes you so different? What makes you special?”

Even within Liverpool, there are people who think that the sense of uniqueness, the separate identity, is an affectation.

It is similar, they believe, to Manchester United supporters adopting the Argentinean flag after 1998 and the demonisation of David Beckham.

They are wrong. They do not understand where the notion of Scouse came from – or where it’s going.

Sadly, the same is true of some of the most ardent proponents of the city’s individual identity.

What is Scouse? Almost everyone knows it began as a cheap stew, lobscouse – a word with Scandinavian origins.

What most do not know is how recently it came to describe the inhabitants of the city.

The word only crept into the vocabulary of north Liverpool after the First World War.



It came into use in the dense slums between Scotland Road and the Mersey. It probably made transition from insult – Scouser being originally those who struggled to survive on the most meagre broth – to a tag of pride.

The Oxford English Dictionary claims the first usage of Scouse to be in 1945. They were 25 years behind the times. But one thing is certain. People described as Scousers – like the great James Larkin – would not have recognised themselves from the term.

What would they have called themselves on the streets of Liverpool before the First World War? ‘Dicky Sam’ was one term, thought to mean ‘imitation Americans’.

The sea trade with the United States meant that American fashions were always to the fore in the city – in the 1950s the ‘Cunard Yanks’ set the stage for the Beatles – but this phrase sounds more like an insult.

Wack, or Wacker still gets used, most often by those from outside the city, but there is a sneering ring to the word.

How would the likes of Larkin have referred to themselves? Simply as Irish.

If Scouse, the dish, is a stew, so is the identity. The seaport brought together myriad cultures which helped shape this character. But its main ingredient is Irishness.

The Liverpool we know was formed in the half decade after 1847, when the Potato Famine funnelled millions of starving immigrants into the port – “the nearest place that wasn’t Ireland.”

Many used it a jumping off point for the Americas or Australia, but enough remained to change the nature of the town.



Particularly in the North End – bounded by Tithebarn Street, Great Homer Street, Boundary Street and the river – the city became a different country.

The Scotland Road electoral district voted TP O’Connor, an Irish Nationalist MP to Parliament between 1885 and 1929.

**The relationship between Liverpool and the rest of the country was shaped and defined by this idea of an alien group of people within the body politic of England.**

I could be remembering wrong though, and even how our very own captain lost his own cousin during the ordeal

Might be worth discussing it with her GP, in case any medication is affecting her skin - someone on the US sub suggested a link recently.

Niacinamide (vitamin B3) is a gentle yet effective topical active, I've just done an entry for the Wiki on it. From the research it is anti inflammatory, regulates sebum production, can strengthen the skin barrier at 2% to 4%. The 4% Nicam brand gel appears in the British National Formulary, so is either on prescription or only at the pharmacy counter. The 4% Freederm brand gel is in the acne section.
 
http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients

If you cannot face an extra step in the routine, some products include niacinamide, the most likely to have a decent percentage is CeraVe AM or PM lotions (Amazon as they are US products). AM also has sunscreen which you would need to be using when you are acid exfoliating anyway (photo sensitising). CeraVe contains lipids to strengthen the skin barrier.

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cerave-Time-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion/dp/B003WN1ELQ/

A gentle cleanser is important, this sub recommends the Boots Simply Sensitive wash which is free of harsh surfactants. Half price at Boots right now £1.25. Nothing stopping you using that for face and body if you don't want two products.

Third option is to switch the glycolic acid out for salicylic acid, which is oil soluble so unclogs the pores not just lifts dead skin. This is drying so may be a nightmare without moisturiser tho. Salicylic acid looks to be in the Clearasil pads.

Doctor may advocate benzoyl peroxide but IMO stay away from that.

The safer one with the smaller yield is in central Reading. Value ~£140k.

The higher yield is in Kennington (near the tube) and rents very well. Value, (buyer has added 15k to asking) £180k. Due to height and construction you can't mortgage it so it would be intrinsically linked to the London rental market (which I don't see changing much). Despite this, being in London I imagine the capital to increase at twice the rate of the one in Reading. However, I work freelance and I'm far more interested in steady returns than banking on huge capital increase.

Of the two, I would prefer to live in the one in London.

Cameron should have then called the vote within 1 year as soon as the act of parliament was passed to make the outcome legal. It wouldn't have given the SNP time to produce things like the white paper, which is little more than a lunatics drivel... but short of reading it, it has the effect on voters of making them think the SNP have actually put a lot of work into making sure their plans won't backfire, when in reality the SNP are going into this as blind as everyone else - if not more so given how fanatical they've become about the perceived benefits of seperation.  

It's difficult to say how it'll fall though. The media seem obsessed at the moment with whether its going to be 51% yes or 51% no. What nobody seems to be considering is that after this is all said and done on September 19th, Scotland will need to undergo a potentially protracted period of reconciliation. Because the real story is that what's about to happen is for every 100 people, 49 are going to be lumped with the future that 51 thought was best... it's going to be incredibly divisive. To the man who works in Edinburgh for RBS and loses his job, his livelihood - maybe even his family because of the strain, it's going to be a hard sell to convince him that independence was for the best. The consequences of this will have real impacts on actual people and it'll create a lot of hate and division on both sides of the border... regardless of the outcome. Let alone I don't think many Scots realize the absolute Shitstorm that awaits them if they vote yes from south of the Border. The sense of betrayal is going to be enormous and Westminster will have an immediate mandate to play ""who can be the bigger cunt"".  

The other issue is if its a 51% yes, we might find a situation where 6-12 months into the negotiations, as ""everyman"" Scots are starting to wake up to the fact that independence is going to inflict some painful changes on them, you might just find a large enough portion of people who want a rerun, perhaps with Devo-max on the table this time.

Whilst it is true TV drama tends to overplay how good the police and intelligence forces are, I wouldn't call them bad guys either. The reality is that the police and the intelligence forces are ultimately just people - and as people they are fallible to the same prejudices and flaws as the rest of us.  The fact is for every bad thing that they do, there are about 10 things they do that save lives.  Our crime rate is good, and we are fairly well protected against any terrorist threat.

Sure there the cops are biased/racist and sure the intelligence services are watching your every move. But on the whole they are a net good. The former issue is something the police are trying to work on eliminating and with enough pressure from protesters and society we may be able to convince intelligence services to back off.

The above stats comparing Joe to various goalkeepers include every minute of the last league season.

I think the whole trend is of a regression, yes. And I think all the data supports this. Have you got a source for the figure you've quoted?

No, I don't believe so much in there being a correlation between the league finishes. In Joe's best season, 2010/11, he was fighting to keep Shay Given out of the side, likewise he was trying very hard to earn England number one status at the time.

He was seeking constant progression, he was focused on constant improvement. He was on the rise, he had everything to prove.

I think the stalling and eventual decline came once he'd established himself at City, with no competition, and likewise had no rival to the England number 1 status.

He began to believe his own hype, and his game suffered.

Historically, he's always been a better player when he's had to prove himself, all the way going back to competing for the number 1 status at City with Kasper Schmeichel and Isaksson, to being sent on loan to Birmingham.

If the competition with Caballero can't bring the best out of him, then he'll effectively be done at City.

SOME of them may be disillusioned with islamism - have seen it is brutal and does not work - and they might be able to return to the UK, and perhaps even be useful in persuading others not to go.   Nevertheless, they should serve prison time if they have committed crimes.

BUT....  my understanding is that many of the disillusioned ones may NOT have abandoned islamist ideology.  They are just not happy in their assigned roles in the IS war machine.  These are the ones we have no use for, and I think we should let them stew over there.

In case you are wondering why they are apparently not happy in their assigned IS roles:

One of the reason for this, is that Arab recruits from middle east countries usually have weapons experience (lots of countries have conscription and/or a gun culture), but British jihadis don't.  British Jihadis also have a reputation for being soft and undisciplined (thanks to their UK upbringing - nobody escapes Nandos and Playstation!).    So, IS usually assigns British jihadis the shitty jobs, such as cleaning, cooking, digging trenches, etc.

Again, utterly open to abuse. You'll have an endless procession of opponents trying to whip up gossip to get a vote going. We currently have a ""recall"" system if an MP does something scandalous or illegal. Including ""I just don't like 'em"" as a reason will make it an unworkable nightmare.

Rent controls are a fantastically terrible idea. Not only have they *never* worked where they've been introduced, but they actually make things far worse. Rent controls mean income rarely covers expenditure, which leads to ""slum-lording"", meaning that conditions people live in are made worse through lack of maintenance, not because the landlord is stingy and hates his tenants, but because the rent controls mean he simply doesn't have the money to perform the maintenance.

However, he might want to fall on his sword purely to stop Boris becoming PM. Five quick scenarios:

1. Scotland votes No, Cameron wins the general election (or leads a coalition) and remains PM.
2. Scotland votes No, Cameron loses the GE. Leadership contest in 2015, Boris likely to win.
3. Scotland votes Yes, Cameron wins the GE due to loss of Labour MPs in Scotland, stays PM.
4. Scotland votes Yes, Cameron stays on as leader but loses in 2015. Boris wins leadership contest, possibly becomes PM in 2020.
5. Scotland votes Yes, Cameron resigns, paving the way for another Tory leader to fight the GE.

Now here's where things get interesting. If there's a Yes vote the Tories are likely to win in 2015, given the loss of Labour MPs in Scotland (assuming no boundary changes between now and then). If the new leader - be it Osborne, May or whoever - didn't win in 2015, they could put the blame for failure on Cameron and stay on to fight again in 2020.

Boris is likely to become an MP in 2015. If there's no leadership contest in the next year or so, his chances of becoming PM start to diminish quite rapidly. There could well be younger, more electable figures to run against - anything could happen.

I'm not sure of Conservative party rules, but it's unlikely they'd elect a non-MP as leader (it's happened before with members of the HoL, but not someone of Boris's status). So if Cameron really wanted to fuck him over, resigning this year would be the way to do it.

BUT, quite honestly it wouldn't surprise me at all if there was no major gulf in quality between the two. Teams on the continent tend to approach youth in a different way (especially barcelona), they are embraced and given time to gel and reach their potential. At the big clubs in England and most definitely Chelsea, youth players are looked at as a risk, a more difficult way of meeting an ends which is getting a player for a specific position. Recent Chelsea history is filled with examples of this. I've been supporting Chelsea since '96 and haven't seen a youth player properly become part of the first team squad since Terry (maybe Huth, Sinclair and McEachran don't count in my eyes) and it is quite frankly nothing short of embarrassing and the number 1 thing I despise at the club. I really do hope it changes sooner rather than later. 

Just to add to my point, i've followed closely the reserves and youth team (U-21 and U-18 now) for just over 14 years. In that time I have seen some top notch performances from players in our youth against some players that have went on to become superstars. I remember, for example, watching games where Thiago Alcontrao and Pogba were playing and our midfield players looking as good if not better (special mention to the duo of McEachran and Clifford who were bossing it as a twosome). And yet those players go on to be superstars and Chelsea players don't. I know a lot of you will point to the players and say its their fault, which is a fair argument that is difficult to disprove, but if you look at it as 15+ years with no youth progression, to assume it is ALL those players faults is ridiculous.",0,1410175056,null,0,false,0,ckcd9it,t3_2fr2u5,t1_ckcd9it,t3_2fr2u5,null,1427128381,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Let's start with two areas for my manifesto: Healthcare &amp; Policing.

Healthcare should be funded through a reformed National Insurance scheme, which everyone over 17 would pay - with benefits &amp; pensions uprated to allow for the payments. A NI number would be issued after 12 consecutive monthly payments. Over 18 with no NI number: no free NHS treatment, except for trauma cases. Healthcare should return to the 1974 model with public involvement but regional management. There should be a nationally agreed list of diseases &amp; conditions that the NHS would pay for, along with a set of service standards - debated at, say, five yearly intervals. A list of core services should be set which would not be subject to private tendering.

Policing would be radically reorganised with 'serious' crime dealt with by a national force, and 'less serious' crime and civil offences (parking, littering etc) dealt with by local forces (?PCSO style?) managed by local authorities or locally elected mayors. There would be a statutory duty for the local &amp; national forces to cooperate. The definition of 'serious' and 'less serious'  would be subject to debate and revision.",0,1410175558,null,0,false,0,ckcdd5m,t3_2fs602,t1_ckcdd5m,t3_2fs602,null,1427128334,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I do not agree with either fully but I do think an independent Scotland would head in a more liberal European direction that at least tried to diversify our economy somewhat. I also feel a Holyrood government better represents Scotland. So I will cliff note it below:

* The rightward lurch of British politics partly in response to UKIP
* The evermore likely English exit from the EU which I find worse than the absence of a currency union
* At least some effort to make our economy less service based and work in some manufacturing as opposed to our current dependence on financial services. 
* Growth focused in the South East. The reasons behind this are many but no governments have appeared to spread the prosperity even in England.
* A completely out of touch political class made ever more apparent by the referendum campaigns and their recent marketing debacles. I do not consider Holyrood perfect but I feel it better represents and addresses the issues of the people of Scotland.
* A broken electoral and political system
* The poisonous influence of The City in this system
* English privatisation of the NHS which will affect Scotland indirectly eventually
* The offers of devolution powers only being reared now (and even now only as a timetable) seem like a last ditch effort rather than genuine. I find it insulting. They never thought there'd be a debate. They took the Scots for granted. If you'd offered these even at the beginning of the year Yes would have been stopped dead.
* Better Together and their recently bitter and personal attack ads labelling anyone who doesn't vote No as not loving their family or country. Painting Scotland as nothing more than this pishy wee region in the North.

I have no issue with NATO, nuclear power or nuclear weapons. I also feel that Scotland leaving would probably be good for England and that it may lead to devolution of a sort there.

I would nationalise power generation, power transmission, water storage (reservoirs) and bulk pipelines - all too vital to national resilience to be left to market forces.

While I would nationalise the railways I wouldn't automatically return to,the old BR model - I'd look for much more localised management to meet local demands.
I'd invest heavily in inter-urban light rail, funded primarily by making road users pay a fairer amount for the infrastructure they use, including fairer pollution charging, and probably charging for on-street parking.
I'd invest in a renationalised canal system both as a parallel freight network for non-time sensitive goods, a leisure network, and as a means of transporting water around.

I'd consider what are the draws for the massive amount of house building - particularly on green field sites in the South East. I'd consider if buy-to-let needs to be seriously curtailed, or indeed extended with better protection for tenants. Would incentives for business to relocate outside of London be needed to redress the balance across the country?

I would not invest in HS2 in its present form. If HSx is to be built it needs to connect the Midlands and the North with continental Europe; it also needs to connect across cities in the midlands and the North. If it is needed it needs to be built quickly.

I worked in kitchens for years as a chef when I was younger, I stuck to waterproof mascara, eyeliner and tinted lip balm. When you are working in a steamy environment I'd keep your skin as natural as possible because when you start sweating your skin will feel horrible if you have several layers of primer, foundation and powder on. This isn't like a hot day, it's incredibly humid so if you need a base I'd stick to a bb cream and concealer at the most. If you are going out after work take in wipes and a mini makeup bag and reapply your makeup when you finish. In regards to deodorant, my cheapest advice would be get the extra strong male version of your preferred brand, men's deodorants seem to be more powerful, and there are plenty available with neutral scents so don't worry about smelling masculine!

La Liga isn't an effective comparison?

Sounds a bit like you've been swallowed up by the Premier League hype. The leagues are comparable, obviously not identically, but they're perfectly suitable in a comparison.

In fact, according to UEFA's coefficient index (what they use to measure the success of domestic clubs in UEFA competitions, i.e The Champions League and Europa League, and thus assign a limited number of CL places per country's league finish, with the eventual highest ranked leagues receiving 4 CL places, the lowest just 1), Spain's La Liga is the strongest league in Europe and is top of their coefficient index.

The top 5 leagues from the list is as follows:

- 1. Spain (La Liga) - 4 CL places
- 2. England (Premier League) - 4 CL places
- 3. Germany (Bundesliga) - 4 CL places
- 4. Portugal (Primeira Liga) - 3 CL places
- 5. Italy (Serie A) - 3 CL places

La Liga is a perfectly suitable league to compare players from. A comparison between France's Ligue 1 and the Premier League would be less valid, for example.

But enough of that.

I agree, I don't think more saves indicates a better keeper. More saves usually indicates a goalkeeper plays for a team with a poorer defence, but it's still a fairly notable statistic nonetheless. I don't agree that goals conceded is a particularly fair barometer either, for that same reason: the poorer teams will always concede more goals, since they have less possession, and generally, a poorer defence which concedes more shots on target.

The key statistic is saves per goal. Joe is rock bottom among all the goalkeepers I've listed on that statistic. 11 Goalkeepers and Joe is weaker than all of them on that key stat.

And that should be the most glaring of all the statistics provided, as shot stopping has traditionally always been one of Joe's strengths. We all knew what his weaknesses are, so the passing and distribution statistics shouldn't surprise anyone, but the saves per goal statistic is a really glaring one, and underlines how much Joe has regressed in every department.

Once you take away his stop stopping, the truth is, Joe is an average goalkeeper. And the statistics show this, very clearly.

We all know Joe is capable of more, but this has been a longterm trend now, a more than two years in fact.

We can't afford to gamble on it continuing, another year like the last and Joe can't be given a new contract, he'd have to be let go.

We can't afford to carry passengers anymore.

What area of IT?

Just as a pointer, I worked at the time in a relatively large data warehousing/big data/marketing company (~11,000 staff worldwide). I earned £25k plus bonus at the time.

I should clarify, I wasn't losing money each month... Simply I didn't make any. I lived from paycheck to paycheck each month. So, when a big bill or something you wanted to do came along, I had no extra disposable income. So, then I'd get say a £200 debt... Then it would always carry over each month as I couldn't clear it.

You could live on that salary of course and save... But then you forgo things like outings with mates, holidays etc... Just to ensure you saved cash each month. At 23... 24 years, I wanted to make the most of life, so it was depressing to think I couldn't live freely for fear of debt.

I've been living in Germany for 1 year now... Debt cleared, good disposable income and freedom.

I liked London for what it was... I enjoyed the lifestyle. It was just never sustainable and after 3 years I just decided I couldn't do it and luckily, had the option to transfer with my company abroad.

You're in breach of the law you quoted under one of two conditions:

Condition 1:

&gt;""a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trade a sign which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which it is registered

Is the trade sign 'identical' to the trade mark?

No.

OK let's look at the other one:

&gt; A person may also infringe a registered trademark where the sign is similar and the goods or services are similar to those for which the mark is registered and there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public as a result 

Is the sign similar? Yes.

Are the goods or services similar? Not in the slightest.

Is there a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public? This is the question that will result in huge legal bills. The movie studio would argue that while the services aren't similar the public may feel it has been endorsed and is official merchandising/advertising etc. The defense would say that there's zero change that anyone in the public would feel it is in any way official.

If someone flicks off a light switch and the light goes off, of course the correlation of those events is indicative of a link. Oh but 'correlation does not imply causation!' So obviously it's *just as likely* that it was the fact that it was raining at the time that made the light go out, or the fact that you were eating a pork pie perhaps.

If correlation never implied causation, all evidence for anything would be meaningless. In the case of the rain and the pie, the correlation of them with the light going off is meaningless because there is no reason to believe that they are connected. Experimentation with the light switch or research into the function of light switches, however, would demonstrate that it is in fact linked to the light, and the reason using it correlated with the light going off is because they are on an electrical circuit.

Decreasingly so unfortunately. Software allows complexity and quality to skyrocket when applied correctly, and nearly everything in the future will be touched by computers. If we're talking about a robot economy in the future you'll have maintainers (plugging in cables, physical installation) and the designers (setting up the software to make systems interact). 

&gt;but I think we're wasting money trying to get people to ""code"", when there's still masses of people leaving school who are incapable of using English and Mathematics. 

To code effectively you need to know some pretty advanced maths. It's a great practical use of the stuff you learn in school. As someone who learns by doing, this is *great*. I can sit down and play around with the numbers and watch the equations interact. 

On top of this, the kind of maths problems that undergraduate and postgraduate courses encounter typically need computational power to crunch through them.

Windows basically has a list of known file extensions (that software can add to and alter) which tells Windows what program to open files with that extension with by default.
