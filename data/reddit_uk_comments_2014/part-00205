.....signing a player of Reus' (or di Maria's) calibre is just the kind of statement we need to make. Look at it this way - Chelsea and City will take 2 of the top 3 spots. Sanchez gives Arsenal a whole new dimension in attack. I expect him to combine really well with Ramsey, Cazorla and Walcott. Expecting a strong season from Arsenal so let's say they finish third.

That gives us 1 CL spot to compete for, against United and Spurs. You never know if something might click for those two. Both have pragmatic coaches who know all about technical football. Not fucking hoofball.

We've been significantly weakened in attack, teams now have some kind of idea as to how we approach games (especially at Anfield), and then there's the Champions League (extra games, players adjusting to a new gameplan)

So yeah, missing out on 4th would pose a whole new set of problems. Every buy apart from Lambert, in some way, has been influenced by the fact that we have CL footy to offer, albeit for what could be only one season. That's the pull of CL footy. The likes of Can and Markovic, when they start realizing their potential, are going to want consistent CL footy. We can't afford to drop out of it. Not after it took us 5 years to get back in it.

&gt;Personal __Income tax in Spain__ (IRPF) was introduced in 1900. It represents over 50% of government revenues.  Since 2007, the responsibility for [tax revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_revenue) has been decentralised, with the autonomous regions responsible for collecting 50% of tax revenue, although it is collected by the central tax authority on their behalf. A single national rate applies per taxation band for the whole nationportion of the income tax. Tax rates on the regional portion vary from region-to-region with [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid) having the lowest and [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia) the highest. Tax is withheld by the employer monthly on behalf of the tax authority. Tax returns are submitted between April and June of the following year and reimbursals are paid between May and July.

Welcome to Belfast.

The sites you've mentioned wouldn't really be suitable for job search within a Northern Irish perspective. Gumtree is used more for selling or ""classifieds"" and monster being used more internationally- particularly around the U.S.

The main job sites here are:

* http://www.nijobfinder.co.uk/
* http://www.nijobs.com/
* http://www.recruitni.com/

These sites are for private companies to advertise their work- so you'll find agency and private work usually, with the odd public work. (But like.. 70% agency.)

* http://www.jobcentreonline.com/JCOLFront/Home.aspx 

Job Centre online is hosted by the Department of Employment and Learning which means that anyone can list their jobs here- so very few agency; but lowered quality.

Keeping in mind that Northern Ireland has a retarded [dependency on the public sector for work](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/81554/rebalancing_the_northern_ireland_economy_consultation.pdf) it might be worth keeping an eye on more public work:

* https://www.hscrecruit.com/ - Health Service
* http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/jobs/Jobs.aspx - Council
* https://irecruit-ext.hrconnect.nigov.net/jobs/vacancies.aspx - Civil Service

Naturally, if you're struggling with finding employment check out a couple of agencies- I won't list 'em but there is a plethora to be found online with many specializing within I.T. work.

There is definitely I.T. work out there- with varying degrees on how nice it is.

Good luck finding work dude, it's frustrating but just keep at it!

There's the frame of reference regarding ordinary time; travelling forwards in a line from the observer's perspective, A, then there's also independent time of multitemporal events that can happen in any direction in time, B. For the sake of argument, the Doctor's timeline is line C, and that's going all over the place.

Imagine the explosion happening, still in a straight line, but in a completely different direction to standard time. There's still a before and after when it comes to this line, it's just not directly parallel to the line of normal time.

Say line B intersects line A where B is shortly after the TARDIS explosion (before the cracks have a chance to spread to everything) and line A is somewhere between 1851 and 2008. The point of intersection is when the events of line B (the explosion) affect line A (normal time). Line B is slowly moving so that the intersection moves forward in B-time as the explosion spreads.

The Doctor travels along line C to 1851 (*The Next Doctor* happens), but leaves before the effects reach 1851. Some time after, he goes to 2059, again, before the effects manage to reach 2008, so Adelaide still remembers the invasion. As line B moves forward in its own relative time, the cracks accelerate and begin to touch more places, spread out farther in time and the line aligns itself with Line A, slowly rotating until it's affecting every event on line A. By the time the Doctor, along line C, reaches 2010, Amy's already forgotten the Daleks.

But please allow me to play devil's advocate for just a moment. Should there not be even a modicum of shame associated with being a benefit claimant? I'm sure we agree that it shouldn't be something to be proud of, that much is obvious I hope.

Just for argument's sake though, I'll go further and say that perhaps there *should* be some shame attached to being a claimant, just as an incentive for people to want to work and get off claiming.

But then, this is based on the assumption that there are a significant number of people on benefits out of choice. I realise that this is actually a complete fallacy encourage by our current government and less scrupulous parts of the media, and truthfully, the vast majority are simply unable to find a job, not out of their own fault or inadequacy, simply out of bad luck.

My concern with these things is that, if you only invest monthly, you often have to pay Â£10+ per trade which adds up quickly. I think lifestrategy might be OEIC which is maybe free to trade on CS Direct...?

Regarding compounding costs, fees etc. this is an interesting comparison because Nutmeg is a wealth management service rather than a product. I see the comparison like this:

* Lifestrategy 0.29% vs. Nutmeg ETF investment choices 0.3% (average) - almost exactly the same but lifestrategy offers excellent diversification for a single product!
* CS Direct bid-offer spread: no idea; vs. Nutmeg 0.17% - Not sure what CS offer but my gut feeling is that Nutmeg probably get better on average because of bulk trading
* CS platform fee/trading charges 0.3% + dealing charges on certain products vs. Nutmeg 1% management fee (sliding to 0.3% at Â£500k+) - these are difficult to compare because of the dealing and Nutmeg's more active re-allocation of the portfolio... if you trade a lot then Nutmeg will probably save you money (unless you have a big portfolio!). Another thought is that Nutmeg will manage investments tax-efficiently if you are fortunate enough to be investing over the ISA limit.

The more I think about it, the more it seems these different options are essentially focused on achieving the same thing...

At some stage the barony was divided into [Oneilland East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneilland_East) and [Oneilland West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneilland_West).

true,threep03k64,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Should there not be even a modicum of shame associated with being a benefit claimant? 

I'm going to say no. 

* For a start many people who claim benefits *do* work, they just don't earn enough money. In such circumstances they would effectively be shamed for having a low income rather than not working, and perhaps some would be alright with that but I think it sounds horrific.

* Most people on benefits are not claiming fraudulently, and the public perception of the amount of money spent on welfare claimed fraudulently is *way* off (the reality is 70p per Â£100 spent on welfare, the perception is closer to Â£24 per Â£100 spent - [link here](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-public-wrong-about-nearly-everything-survey-shows-8697821.html)). This means we would be shaming a significant amount of honest people for being down on their luck, and for what purpose? Because the public has no idea about the truth of benefits fraud and just wants a witch-hunt? 

My big reason against it though is just ideological. Why is it always the stick and not the carrot? Most people will *want* to work (the carrot), and the government should be there to facilitate that. And by facilitate I mean actually help, not shame you and make the lives of those looking for work more stressful than it has to be. I completely agree that being on welfare is not something someone should be proud of, and there are perhaps some people who would benefit from being shamed. But I think it would do harm to a lot of people just to target the few who do make being on benefits a lifestyle choice and perhaps could do with a bit of shaming.

&gt; can we think of a way to have this kind of system **without** it having too much of a stigma attached?

Well for a start if we hit another recession within the next 20 years and the government doesn't decide to use it as an excuse to launch an attack on the worst off, it might help. This system is going to have a stigma attached to it for as long as people continue to look down on welfare recipients as being scroungers rather than people in need of help. Change perception of claiming and you will change the stigma.

*However* I also think that if a coupon system were to be implemented it would be implemented on the basis of a perceived problem rather than an actual problem. Therefore the second you change the stigma attached to welfare I think you would also lose all incentive to micromanage the lives of people on welfare by implementing such a system.",0,1405678032,null,0,false,0,cj0sgr6,t3_2ayhxy,t1_cj0sgr6,t1_cj0rtxi,null,1434774872,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Gas storage last winter was perilously low (""running on fumes"" was the phrase doing the rounds) but at the moment there isn't an issue taking from Norway, though as you say at some point that will become an issue. Home-grown energy decline has been around 30% and we're making up for it by pushing more through the Norwegian interconnectors, but that's only kicking the problem down the road. Renewables are nowhere near ready to take up the slack, which is why we're seeing a shift towards nuclear.

For me the main concerns are:

* Grid needs to improve its systems, especially with smart meters and the like coming online in the next decade or so
* We need more redundancy in the system to cope with outages and strikes. Grangemouth showed that basically the energy infrastructure is over a barrel to the unions
* Tidal generators that can actually withstand ocean weather - wind isn't going to cut it and currently tidals keep getting smashed to bits. An affordable, resilient tidal generator system would be nice.

The good news is that DECC is aware of all these issues and the policy teams are doing some solid horizon-scanning to pre-empt any of these problems becoming actual.

We wanted to go with EE so we went online and set up an account. Got all the documentation in the post confirming it.

We phone up and get told that our account ""doesn't exist"" and that there is a *pre-existing active account* at our address. We tell them that this was a previous tenant and that we have no way to contact them. The advisor suggested that we track them down and speak to them, otherwise we can't get internet.

So we (in other words) told them to get fucked and went with Sky. Sky don't seem to care so much about who currently has the active line. They told us that the line was actually de-activated and that someone had to come along and re-activate it. So 2 weeks later they did and now we have internet.

The only issue was that the previous tenant obviously hadn't closed the EE account, so she started getting debt collection letters from them. Funnily enough, our EE account suddenly appeared and EE sent debt collectors after us, too, to the tune of Â£80 (despite us never having started our contract). That was a lot of fun.

I think I'm going to wait a little bit to see what other transfers are made and how much each will cost. I think Sturridge is massively going to step up this year and I think Lallana could potentially be a good player to have in the team (again, not sure if he's a 100% starter every game though). I probably won't bother backing our defenders and Mignolet like I stupidly did last year (Mignolet pretty much the whole season). 

Away from us, RVP will definitely get a lot of points but is he worth the massive price? Sanchez could be good and I also think Fabregas will get points.

true,TechJesus,null,null,"&gt; Those 'European laws' are laws drafted by British lawyers after 1945, supported whole-heartedly by Winston Churchill and the Conservative party at the time, a convention to which we have voluntarily signed up, made by an institution we helped create and only exists by the mutual agreement of nation states.

I know the British played a large part in drafting the convention, and it does not change my view.

&gt; There is absolutely no question of sovereignty here. The European convention is not someone else's prerogative being imposed on us - it is our prerogative.

The whole question is over sovereignty. While it was not imposed on us, our acquiescence with it does involve us submitting ourselves to an international court. 

&gt; No country can be truly free until it isolates itself entirely from the global community - what an incredibly bizarre philosophy to hold in the 21st century when corporations, communications and commercial travel span the globe. 

I am not proposing isolation, I am proposing that we reclaim the right to define our own laws, a principle which most countries exercise to some extent, and many countries exercise to a greater extent than we do. It is not incompatible with international trade or communications. We would be free as ever to agree to international conventions on trade or communications. Freer, in fact. 

&gt; If the government cared so much about sovereignty it would pass a new British constitution that re-enacted every right in the ECHR as British law with a British origin. 

As I've said above, I want a British bill of rights to be introduced, and I want it to give more rather than less protection to the rights of the citizen, and for it to be difficult to amend (perhaps requiring a vote from two-thirds of parliament).

No I don't see it as an error. The stated aims of Israelis battle plan so far has been to take out rocket firing stations, Hamas terrorists and weapon stockpiles.

Especially given that it was a gunship that had line of sight to the beach.

&gt;You would have to be deranged to the point of insanity to think that there is moral equivalence between trying to minimise civilian casualties on both sides and trying to maximise civilian casualties on both sides

I do not agree that Israel is trying to minimize civilian casualties. If they were why bomb a hospital? or random civilian houses? I say random because if there was a terrorist in there (remembering that their stated aim is to take out terrorists) they wouldn't knock on the roof first, terrifying who ever is in there and giving them a random amount of time to get out, which has been proven in this current conflict doesn't always happen.

sorry I'm confused now, scoring 40 goals over 2 seasons is the same as scoring 15?

or a decrease in the number of goals scored by 66% is the same as an increase of 50% season on season?

&gt; Uh, yeah. Read it in context.

I'm struggling to find where you used hazard as an example in or out of context...

&gt; I meant that the agent has more power than the player does.

but ultimately the club decides how much they pay a player, an agent can ask for a certain amount and the club can negotiate and offer a deal. It's the club that writes the contract, not the player or the agent.

&gt; Oh, and thanks for using the term ""retarded.""

you're welcome

&gt; You took that out of context.

no I didn't

&gt;  I said that when you don't consider those factors he seems like a great option

well I would argue that even if you do not consider the wages we're paying Torres, he's still shit.

&gt; but in an alternate universe when you don't, he's a darn good 3rd striker.

in an alternate universe I'm sure that I'm a great first choice striker, why on earth would you try to debate football in an alternative universe? It's pointless.

true,mallardtheduck,null,East Midlands,"The intention of Child Benefit is for children, but in the implementation it goes to the parents and there is no safeguard to ensure it's spent appropriately (and this would be incredibly hard to have). Thus, it's possible that some parents may use child benefit to fund their own lifestyles (I'm not commenting on whether or not this is happening and to what degree.) which would conflict with the intention of the benefit.

Regardless of all that, the original (1940s) intention of the benefit was to encourage people to have children, to help solve labour shortages. It has since evolved into a payment for all children. Nowadays, with the number of children tending to be inversely proportional to the household income, some 40-50% of 4+child families are living in poverty and contribute around 20% of child poverty ([source](http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/child-poverty-large-families)). These sorts of numbers would tent to support changes in policies in regards to encouraging/subsidising large numbers of children.

The problem comes, as you say, with the possibility that the youngest child may suffer from the lessened support, through no fault of their own. However, with appropriate safeguards (e.g. automatically considering the 5th child in a low-income family ""at risk"", providing benefits for all children in the case of an unexpected loss of income, etc.) it may well be workable, if it achieves the aim of reducing the number of poor families with large numbers of children.",0,1405683108,null,0,false,0,cj0tfz7,t3_2ay1ts,t1_cj0tfz7,t1_cj0t588,null,1434775425,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

When's the last time Liverpool made a ""big signing"", though? Suarez's arrival came with question marks over his temperament and whether goals in the Eredivisie would translate across to the Prem. Sturridge's arrival came with claims that he was selfish and overhyped because he was English. Carroll was Carroll. Aquilani was injured for most of his first season, and then cast aside by two-man-midfield managers after that. 

You have to go back to Torres for the last time Liverpool made a 'big signing', and at the time even he wasn't at the level some of the ""big signings"" we've been linked with now are at: Sanchez is a player who's already played for Barcelona, by no means failed there, and is just now entering his peak years. As for Reus, his injury was seen as a huge blow because he was widely regarded as being Germany's best attacker ahead of players like Goetze, Mueller, Oezil and Schurrle.

If we signed a player of that status this window, they'd go down as our 'biggest signing' ever, quite frankly.

I think this is the fundamental difference between our perspectives. You see it as a tactic whereas I see it as a mistake. The reason I see it as a mistake is that it doesn't serve Israel's interests from a purely rational perspective. It makes them look bad in the eyes of their allies and trading partners, it strengthens Palestinian claims of grievance, undermines Israeli moral claims, turns Palestinian street opinion further against them making it harder to conduct intelligence, it raises concerns about the abilities of their military, turns Israeli's against the government, etc. all for no discernible strategic benefit. An example of this is here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/2aig93/idf_pilot_calls_off_airstrike_after_children/

&gt; If they were why bomb a hospital? 

[Why not ask that question of both sides?](http://www.beyondimages.info/b146.html) Personally I question the benefit of such a move, but I understand the notion. However, the hospital was warned in advance and given time to evacuate, which it did successfully. Also, it demonstrates the consequences to the Palestinian people of Hamas' continued attacks against Israel having very real and direct consequences for the Palestinian people, not just Israelis, with the intent of eroding Palestinian support for Hamas, terrorism and attacks on Israel.

&gt; or random civilian houses? I say random because if there was a terrorist in there (remembering that their stated aim is to take out terrorists) they wouldn't knock on the roof first

Israel has a stated policy of destroying the launch sites of rocket attacks. This is why Hamas chooses to launch attacks from civilian areas, so the retaliation can be used as criticism against Israel. It is a deliberate policy of Hamas to provoke retaliation against civilian infrastructure because of the propaganda value it provides. If they launched attacks from out in the desert and fled the scene immediately after launch then the Israeli retaliation wouldn't be of any benefit to Hamas. This is why Hamas launch attacks from populated civilian areas and places like hospital rooftops instead of places where the retaliation won't hurt the Palestinian people.

There is a difference between attacking launch sites and terrorists. They don't knock if there is a terrorist known to be at a specific location. They knock if there are known to be civilians there and it is not known if a terrorist is still there or not. This is to give the civilians time to flee (significantly more time than the residents of Sderot get from their rocket warning systems). If the Israelis know a terrorist is at a specific location then they do not knock, they make an assessment of the situation to determine the cost/benefit ratio of launching a strike against the terrorist, which includes the potential of civilian lives.

&gt; if there was a terrorist in there (remembering that their stated aim is to take out terrorists) they wouldn't knock on the roof first, terrifying who ever is in there and giving them a random amount of time to get out, which has been proven in this current conflict doesn't always happen.

We want to stick with first direct for several reasons - complexity and pan in the ass long applications are only part of.

They're friendly, easy to get info from, online banking is a bit rustic but it does the job. They also have the majority of our  financial world and it's great having just one number to call.

Good tip for what we want to use it for. We have three specific items, one semi-Structural (bay windows) - replacing back doors - and retiling downstairs bathroom. Kitchens and bathrooms are only a year old so they won't be touched.  We have quotes for 23/30ks work. I actually think we will probably end up taking 25 as I've not started haggling yet.

How they got the land is a tricky question. Cromwell headed back to England early in the campaign (he stopped the massacre at Drogheda only after he witnessed one of his own men hack a pregnant women to death on the street) and I think the guy he left in charge was called Coote. Coote moved around the 6 counties Murdering, Kidnapping and driving off the natives. 50,000 Irish were then sold into slavery in the Caribbean at that time. When the country side was subdued the planters move in taking over large tracts of land and the homes of 10 families each. Hungry exposed and oppressed the natives tried to retake their ancestral homes but failed and generations later we have the unnatural division that is partition and the holy fuck up that is the current situation.

Llywelyn, tears of blood you'd weep,

If you should see this from your sleep:

Our heart in a foreigner's hand,

Our ancient throne in a conqueror's land;

A nation where the meek abound,

Where once were men who stood their ground.

We smile beneath the Royalty,

Peasants are peasants, never free.

We'll carry on our slavish way

Content and happy come what may;

Lost of roots, nothing to save,

Without a care but to behave.

We shall not be deceived for long

By fables and historic song,

For we, who now just count to ten,

Are Wales' Rule-Britannia men.

We are the patriots who lack fire,

The headstrong international choir.

In honour of your name, my land,

I'll ride with reddened sword in hand,

And nothing more than this is true:

How I could spill this blood for you.

I was in Manchester yesterday having been away for a few months, the amount of litter around is disgusting. The city centre is especially bad. I forgot how scruffy it was.

People often say it's because there is a lack of bins, but I don't buy that at all. There are plenty of bins dotted around town, you never have to walk more than a few minutes before you come across one. Are these peoples lives really that important that they can't hold onto that rubbish for another minute or two? If you managed to hold that coffee cup while it was full of coffee then why do you suddenly lose the ability to carry it when empty, you scruffy git.
Not only that but when I visited Canada and the US a few months ago there were barely any bins dotted around compared to the UK. Yet compared to Manchester, the litter situation was like a paradise.

&gt;__Cnut the Great__  ([Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse): *KnÃºtr inn rÃ­ki*;  [c.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circa) 985 or 995Â â 12 November 1035), more commonly known as __Canute__, was a king of [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark), [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway), and parts of [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden), together often referred to as the Anglo-Scandinavian or [North Sea Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_Empire). After his death, the deaths of his heirs within a decade, and the [Norman conquest of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England) in 1066, his legacy was largely lost to history. Historian [Norman Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_F._Cantor) has made the statement that he was ""the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history"", despite his not being Anglo-Saxon.

How is he statistically NOT better than eriksen?

**ERIKSEN**

2013/2014	Tottenham	EPL	Apps:23(2)    	G:7    	A:8	   	-	

2013/2014	Tottenham	IUC	Apps:4(5)	G:3	A:2	

2013/2014	Ajax	NE	Apps:4	G:2	A:3

**Total**: Started 31, appeared in 38. 12 goals, 12 assists. Involved in **24 goals** directly. 

--------------------------------------
**GYLFI**

2011/2012	Swansea	EPL	Apps:17(1)	G:7	A:3	

2011/2012	Hoffenheim	GB	Apps:7	G:0	A:1

**Total**: 24 starts, 25 appearances. 7 goals, 4 assists. Involved in **11 goals** directly. 

So Eriksen puts in 10 more apperances  than Gylfi does at the same age, then goes on to be directly involved in double the goals scored for Spurs. How does that place him on par? That 10 role is to score goals yes, but it's also to be so a dumb-foundedly creative playmaker that he doesn't have to score them all himself. No-one on Spurs is good enough to see that opening up. Maybe Lamela in the future, but that might not pay off. Lennon, Townsend, Paulinho, Dembele, Sandro. They're not the most creative buggers in the world, and you can't argue that. If Gylfi can score, and can keep up pace, then great: we need him at LW, CM, RW as cover and starting for cup games. 

&gt;If you ever even followed eriksen you would know he has as many bad days as good, or even more.

Yes he does. So does Siggy. Move on. 

&gt;or play in any of the positions offensively due to injuries, something eriksen cant do.

That's true. Eriksen can't play the number of positions that Siggy can. I can't argue, but Gylfi plays them all at the same ability. Which has made him something of a great tool to have in the box come injuries, subs, etc. He doesn't specialize in that 10 role like Eriksen does to be the creative mastermind. 

&gt;sigurdsson has stated several times spurs is just a stepping stone for him

Well that's perfect then, we're moving him on as a stepping stone should. It didn't appear last year he was going to get the time, but maybe he will under Poch somewhere and I'd love it if he did. If not, he got his wish to go play 90 minutes week in and week out to get that ticket to Old Trafford.

Precisely my point, that Wall St and its related actors caused the crash by packaging securities as investments, aided by credit agencies, which spread these toxic instruments around the globe. This was what I was referring to as black bags of debt. 

Have the bad players been punished? Have we changed any laws? Nope, everything has stayed the same, we've bailed them out with truly astounding amounts of free cash and we got nothing in return. The problem has just been deferred and it won't be long before more collateralised debts come back and start kicking our asses again. 

That the individuals and organizations were encouraged to perform these acts is the responsibility not only of government but the businesses themselves. Businesses we punished by gifting a tonne of cash to them. 

There is value in many financial services no doubt, but the bulk of activity on Wall Street causes significantly more harm than the good it creates, IMO.

Again, despite claiming you aren't at all defensive, you seem to immediately take everything I say personally.

Clearly, there's some confusion between release clauses and buyout clauses. I think the initial comment you replied to showed that confusion. I mistakenly tried to correct something you said, which was 100% right, and then tried to continue a discussion about the clauses, and you got angry and started talking about how you know everything.

I'm curious, why do you come here if you don't like to discuss things with others? I don't think I was hostile at all to you, at least not until you started getting pretty rude yourself.

I have an immense love for that whole team, we had a great squad with a strong core and you always got the feeling the dressing room was in top condition

I remember that whole season was a battle that we managed to succeed with the arguably weakest team in the top 5/6. I know we can do it again.

We had players that could impact games, even when we brought in Gudjohnson, he changed a couple games.

That is what we are currently missing, or at least what I perceive as missing, players that can impact on a game, I really hope that our midfield manages to make a difference, our poacher is able to find the goals and our wingers find the form that we had in the video.

We are so close to achieving greatness, and I believe we can do it with less than we have at the moment. Come on Poch, come on Spurs and bring on the fucking 16th of August! COYS!",0,1405690536,null,0,false,0,cj0vlvd,t3_2b1efx,t1_cj0vlvd,t3_2b1efx,null,1434776361,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

true,Weirfish,null,null,"Tell you what, lets be reasonable about this and say that people who are concerned with female rights (reproductive, workplace, whatever, all of it) are separate from the misandrist, hate-filled fucktards that poison the equality well, just as those concerned with male rights (custody, mental health, whatever, all of it) are separate from the misogynist, hate-filled fucktards that equally poison the equality well. Both of the groups of fucktards will be referred to as such.

The current state of affairs, as far as I can read them, is as follows:

* Topics primarily concerning male issues (""male topics"") cannot be posted on /r/feminism, because of the resident population of anti-male fucktards among the reasonable people. People are fine with this, because of historical precedent (ie, men have had it better than women, so they probably still do)

* Topics primarily concerning female issues (""female topics"") aren't posted to /r/MensRights on the basis that those can be posted to /r/TwoX, /r/feminism and a bunch of other subs, whereas male topics get /r/SRS'd if they're posted anywhere else. People are happy enough with this because ""Men's Rights Activists"" have, historically, been a bunch of the aforementioned anti-woman fucktards who have no concept of social responsibility.

Now, if neither group of anti-gender fucktards existed, life would be a lot easier. MRA/Men's Rights wouldn't have such a massive stigma attached to it and perhaps some of the legitimate issues that men face on a statistical level could be given some think-time alongside the legitimate issues that women face on a statistical level. Similarly, people wouldn't dismiss self-identifying feminists as crazy misandrist extremists and might actually pay attention to their arguments, nor would impressionable young people be obsessed with the idea that a man looking at them is tantamount to being invasively penetrated and potentially inseminated against their will, or that the way a man sits is indicative of him needing to control his environment (testicles don't like being squashed).

However, as it stands, people are happy to listen to the fucktards who post on /r/feminism, and give them the same weight as the actually intelligent, coherant and useful people who also post on /r/feminism. These same people disregard the intelligent, coherant and useful people who post on /r/MensRights because they think they're all the kind of fucktards who post the shitty things on /r/MensRights.

Do you see the issue? It's not meant to be gender v gender at any level, in this discussion. It SHOULD be sane, intelligent and rational conversationalist v extremist hatefilled dickbiscuits, but the extremist, hatefilled dickbiscuits are shouting/have shouted so loud that it has become gender v gender; the very thing that equality is designed to combat.

/r/MensRights has a stigma attached to it that it is trying to shake off, such that it can enter a debate in which it has a very real stake and very real points to make. The fucktards of /r/feminism and /r/SRS are actively trying to stop them, because they refuse to listen to any other point of view, whereas the intelligent people in /r/feminism (and possibly in /r/SRS, but given its nature I'm disinclined to believe that), and those who don't subscribe to it, might want to actually pay attention to the points they make, but can't for fear of being banned, or, worse, dox'd.

There are fucktards in both teams, but in this discussion, feminism has the home field advantage and Mens Rights are only allowed to play in their corner of the pitch due to antiquated rules instigated by feminist fucktards and given justification through MRA fucktards.

It'd be nice if we could disqualify (ie ban from the discussion, lets not get too extreme) the fucktards who think women belong in the kitchen and all men are rapists, and just play the game of life together, but as it is, we have to make do with playing apart, and /r/MensRights is 'our' pitch

(speaking as a man who's fuckin' tired of all of this bullshit that gets perpetuated by both parties and wishes that everyone would shut the fuck up, treat people the same, and get on with what little, pointless, fantastic time we have on this planet)

true,BFoskett,eng-somerset,Somerset,"This bit in particular resonated with me...

&gt;The United Kingdom embodies the belief that people with distinct histories and identities can live together, and that their diversity makes their culture, their economy and their polity stronger. Tellingly, most members of ethnic minorities describe themselves as British rather than English or Scottish; they instinctively recognise the capacious, liberal identityâone which rests not on narrow nationalism, but on an enlightened concept of nationhoodâthat the union offers. In a world plagued by ethnic hatred, cultural prejudice and religious violence, that venerable idea should count for more than the real but fleeting disappointments and sense of alienation that the Scots have experienced in recent decades.

&gt;If this ideal were undermined by Britainâs dissolution, and the countryâs voice itself were weakened, the amour propre of Britons would not be the only victim. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a big noise in the IMF, the G7 and the European Union, Britain can make itself heard in support of values such as human rights, democracy, freedom of speech, the rule of law and clean government that are threatened by the rise of states and ideologies that do not share them. If Scotland were to push off, neither it nor residual Britain would have as much influence as they do today, and the world would be the poorer for it.

&gt;Although this newspaper believes that, for all these reasons, the union is worth preserving, we also think it needs changing. As a political expression of liberal values and attitudes, it would be more credible if it were not so centralised. The devolution of powers to Scotland has been a mild extortion racket; and elsewhere the flow has gone to Westminster rather than away from it. But if diverse peoples are to be bound together, they must be given plenty of slack. So instead of trying to buy Scottish votes with more cash, Mr Cameron should devolve far more power to all Britainâs cities and regions.

&gt;States cannot easily split their way to happiness, and working out how to accommodate differences can improve them. It makes them more tolerant, pluralist and open, and teaches central governments how to relinquish power. When nations cannot bear to hold together, they must of course separate. But Britain has not reached that point. Scottish nationalists like to say, cheerfully, that their nation is capable of standing on its own. It certainly is. That doesnât mean it should.",0,1405692153,null,0,false,0,cj0w8pg,t3_2b1ome,t1_cj0w8pg,t3_2b1ome,null,1434776750,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I've a huge interest in history and one recurring theme is that of the moral breaking point. The point that where historians and/or general society changes their opinion of actions. You rightly said it is the 'invasion' but not for the reason many may think. The dominance by England/Britain is the point at which the Irish may be considered 'civilised' and that is the trigger for actions to be viewed differently.

For instance we think nothing about glorifying the violence and brutality of Rome, or the Vikings, but something similar in the more recent past rightly causes disgust and shame.

Ireland, like so many other parts of the world, has a complex and wonderful history. However it is too easy to focus on certain parts that bear out a prevailing theme. It is the inverse side of 'to the victor the spoils'. When writing history the 'winner' doesn't always have the loudest voice.

He said that interview about City keeping him from his brother 2 days after his brother died and Yaya was 10,000 miles away in Brazil. To me it sounds like he was obviously devastated and feeling terrible about not being with his brother when he died.

When someone close to you dies like that its natural to wish you could have spent more time with them and its normal for grief to make you irrationally angry. Especially when you are stuck in a hotel in Rio for 15 hours a day.

He didn't ask for time off, but in hindsight he was angry City didn't proactively give it to him without him having to ask.

IMO that is all that was. A grieving brother looking for someone to blame for something, anything to do with his brother dying and that weekend in Abu Dhabi with was an obvious choice. Thats why city made no big deal about announcing that it wasn't true to everyone, they just told a few journalists it wasn't the case and let them spread the word quietly while they waited for him to calm down and return to Manchester.

Now the club aren't making him apologise or correct it publicly because they don't need to and he can say ""City have always been good with me and good with my family"", which is the truth without copping to the fact what he said was untrue. Grief makes you do stupid things especially if one of the few people you can talk to is your money grabbing bastard agent/best friend and theres 100 microphones and cameras shoved in your face looking for a story.

He felt guilty about his absence from his brother, he said something stupid, as long as he doesn't still actually blame the Club I see no reason not to just draw a line under the whole thing and get back to playing football.

Im not going to pretend I wasn't getting pissed off with the whining too, and the whole thing has made him look bad, but I think I can sympathise with how these things happen and lets just hope we have Aguero, Zaba, Silva and Kompany's birthdays marked down on a calendar somewhere.",0,1405692981,null,0,false,0,cj0wl1j,t3_2b1e4f,t1_cj0wl1j,t1_cj0tzyf,null,1434776966,16,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,16

As much as we love Brad Jones' story, he does not inspire any confidence in me at all to do a job should Mignolet go down for an extended period of time. If we do wind up selling Reina, I think we should absolutely look for an experienced veteran keeper a la what Chelsea did with Mark Schwarzer last season.

My point  = I don't think we're trying to sign Reus, not only because it's clearly a non starter (Dortmund will sell if offer is high enough, but no way Reus doesn't want to wait till next year when any team in the world can activate his buyout), but also because the club confirmed they were ""baffled"" by reports linking us to him. Does either of these things mean we definitely won't sign him, no, but it does make it the much more likely out come.

Your point = You think we're trying to sign him, because we don't know that we're not. You don't have anything that would suggest we're trying to sign him, nor would it make sense for him to want to move here.

If someone can't crouch down to tie up a child's shoelaces (as was the case with this chap), what does it matter if it's because of his obesity (caused by over-eating) or if his knees have been obliterated by arthritis (exacerbated by a lifetime of skiing moguls) or because his exercise tolerance is minimal due to lung disease (brought on by smoking)?

What if his obesity were a symptom of a genetic syndrome like Prader-Willi? Would that make him be seen as 'disabled' any more than a man of equal weight brought on by over-eating in the absence of a genetic abnormality?

My point is that 'disability' by is defined as ""a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities"". It's defined by the end result - not the underlying condition.

It just pisses me off because there are a lot of people with conditions who are seen as 'disabled' even if they can perform certain activities fine. It's like writing off an amputee as too disabled to work if they're job is an office/desk one. And the counterpart is that some people who are disabled aren't given the recognition. For example, in Scotland, we provide free personal care at home to people over the age of 65.

Fuck sake, I liked the fucking EU, now we get this. Brilliant.

Fat people aren't denied any rights. Obesity is not a civil rights issue. Fat people don't have to sit at the back of a bus, they don't have different toilets and they most certainly don't get randomly lynched for looking at a thin person.

But no. Fat people aren't responsible for their own actions, they aren't fat because they eat to much, they are fat because 'conditions' and 'thyroid issues'. Because when you become a certain weight the laws of thermo-fucking-dynamics no longer apply to you and you just randomly add mass to yourself, until you get to your 'set point' or whatever bullshit of the week the fat cowards are spewing.

RIP in peace personal responsibility. Was fun, mate.

true,brixton1915,null,null,"About Suarez Transfer:
- The thing that sucks about the Suarez transfer is that he only left for Â£75. Last year the only way Suarez was going to sign a contract was if we had put in a clear cut buyout clause and it was pretty clear both Real and Barca were going to trigger it this summer
- Before the World Cup, Real and Barca were basically in a bidding war over Suarez and basically they were both offering around what he believed to be somewhere near 100m
- Once he bit Chellini, Madrid backed out and his price for barca fell to what his buyout clause was
- FSG basically knew he was leaving this summer and tried to do whatever they could to either keep him. But he wasnât going to stay under any circumstances so they tried to get as much money as possible from the transfer
- Believes LFC got a lot of money upfront Barca, he says thereâs at least Â£75 for BR to spend this summer coming from this transfer but the money will be more available only if the right players come alongâ¦if the players are good enoughï the money will be available.

About FSG:
â¢	He believes when FSG first bought the club JWH thought the team was an easy team to fix and then just sell again at a huge profit. But he thinks now Henry is doing this purely for his desire to win. He claims Henry has made enough money is his life so he doesn't need to do things nowadays for the easy turnover. He stressed JWH's desire to win about 5-6 times in the interview and Henry is with us now because of that.
â¢	Evans admits he was a huge critic of FSG in the early years, especially after they sacked Kenny. He says there are many owners out there that are bad owners for our club and the ones we have now are definitely not one of them. They're not the type of owners who's going to pump tons of their own money into our club like the Arabs. But JWH will do more than anything and will do anything he can to get the players at the right price. He thinks FSG are definitely the right owners, but questions the abilities of some of the people at the club (i.e. our transfer committee)
        o Last January Rodgers wanted defenders and asked the  owner/transfer committee for money but the transfer committee said they couldnât find defenders which surprised the managers and the ownership
ï§	He believes if we had a good center back last year we would have won the league and the owners in Boston were as confused as Rodgers was that we didnât sign any defendersâ¦Evans questions the transfer committeeâs reliance on statistics and things like that which is a problem in why we couldnât find a CB last January. He thinks if Jamie Carragher was still playing last year we would have won the title because of his leadership on the field and abilities to organize our backs. Evans says the center backs (and even Mignolet) we have now are all pretty good but none of them talk or have the leadership presence that Carragher had which is the biggest problem.
â¢	Basically, we need to buy a CB whoâs vocal and organize our defense
ï§	Evans also is surprised we keep going after wingers this window instead of filling in other holes
â¢	Evans wonders on the transfer committeeâs reliance on statistics and things like that which is a problem in why they couldnât find a center defender.


â¢	Says not to get our hopes up over Reus. Our club is looking for players who are good enough to play in the champions league and are ready to make that step to the champions league but not the ones who have already proven as CL caliber players since theyâre more expensive. 
â¢	Has a feeling weâre going to get Moreno

1.) Newspapers need to actually sell copies off the newstand in the UK in a way that doesn't happen in the US. As such, sensationalist headlines ""VERTONGHEN DEMANDS TOTTENHAM EXIT"" are the norm, after all who wants to buy the paper that says ""no news on the transfer front, Spurs seem to be making inquiries in a responsible and measured way""? And for lots of reasons, Spurs are everyone's favorite not-quite-big club about which to print nonsense, partly because we do so often dabble in the transfer market.

2.) To a lesser degree, sites like Sky are also trying to juice the betting on transfers. If you go to their sites, directly next to the latest transfer rumors are opportunities to bet on transfers. So they create a market by taking quotes out of context or blowing stuff out of proportion (the best is when they get a player to talk about their admiration for a club like Barca, and then use it as ""Player hints at Spurs exit"").

So keep those two things in mind when you see rumors, both for players out and in, and remember that in the end, we'll sell a couple players, buy a couple players and get on with it.

As for British banks, while there were periods before the crisis when they were willing to give a mortgage to just about anyone, British corporate lending has *always* been extremely conservative, unless you have a great reputation and are willing to stake several million of your own money on a venture, and even then big money for a new project is quite rare, and split over a large number of banks in a syndication deal. 

By contrast, Venture Capitalism is far bigger in the USA- new ideas can get money far more easily.  In the UK banks &amp; funds won't invest or lend (generally) unless there is an extremely low chance of default.  When you are only getting $300,000 for a $100m loan, you have to be careful, because one default could wipe out 10 years of profits.

&gt;these people should be treated no differently than an alcoholic worker.

Sounds like you don't know how employers have to treat alcoholic workers.


Government guidance for employers dealing with an employee with a possible alochol problem:

- Employees with a drink problem have the same rights to confidentiality
and support as they would if they had any other medical or psychological condition.

- Disciplinary action should be a last resort. A court may find a dismissal unfair if an employer has made no attempt to help an employee whose work problems are related to drinking alcohol.

- The cost of recruiting and training a replacement may be greater than the cost of allowing someone time off to obtain expert help.

- Many people with an alcohol problem are able in time to regain full control over their drinking and return to their previous work performance.

- It may be very difficult for people to admit to themselves or others that their drinking is out of control. They need to know that you will treat their drinking problem as a health problem rather than an immediate cause for dismissal or disciplinary action.

- If employeesâ drinking is a matter of concern, they should be encouraged to seek help from their GP or a specialist alcohol agency.

&gt; Thank you for contacting me about the emergency Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill.

&gt;I can understand your concerns on this issue.
However urgent action is needed to ensure that the authorities continue to have the legal powers necessary to ensure the security and safety of our citizens.

&gt;Communications data and interception assists in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime. Communications data is used in 95 per cent of all serious and organised crime prosecutions, and every major counter-terrorism investigation over the last decade.

&gt;We face losing these powers; the European Court of Justice has struck down regulations that let internet and phone companies retain communications data for law enforcement purposes for up to 12 months. As well as this, some companies are calling for a clearer legal framework to underpin their co-operation with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept what terrorists and serious criminals are saying to each other. Importantly authority can only be granted with a warrant signed by a Secretary of State it is not, as some critics suggest carte blanche for the authorities to access the private communications of individuals.

&gt;The emergency Data Retention and Investigation Powers Bill will enable agencies to maintain existing capabilities. It will respond to the ECJ judgment on data retention and bring clarity to existing law in response to the concerns of some companies. It is a narrow and limited response to the set of specific challenges we face. It solves the immediate problems at hand. Importantly, the Bill includes a termination clause so it will fall at the end of 2016 â forcing the government to look again at these powers.

&gt;The Bill includes a number of measures that will strengthen the oversight of intelligence powers. Between now and 2016, the Government will review the Regulation of Investigatory Power Act to make recommendations to reform and update it. The Bill also proposes establishing a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to ensure civil liberties are properly considered when the Government sets counter-terrorism policy.

&gt;The Bill also restricts the number of public bodies that can ask for communications data and will publish annual transparency reports. This will make more information publicly available than ever before.
I believe that the action this Government is taking will ensure we maintain powers to help keep us safe from those who would harm UK citizens.

&gt;To summarise I would emphasise that the proposals are essential for all our security, contain more safeguards than the previous legislation, will have been fully scrutinised and continue to be so by the various Select Committees.
I hope you feel more reassured but if you have specific concerns as to how the proposals will have a detrimental impact on you I will be pleased to consider closely the points you make.

&gt;Thank you again for taking the time to contact me.

&gt;Yours sincerely,

&gt;Martin Vickers

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;But they haven't. After a quick Google search, no UKIP officials have even alluded to the TTIP or ISDS.

David Coburn has been yammering on about it for sometime now and only last week confirmed that the party as a whole was against it.     

We have the UKIP spokesperson and chair for health policy who has confirmed with the NEC that UKIP is committed to keeping the NHS free at the point of use.   

The TTIP is an EU deal that signs more power away from the UK.  The party is nothing if not committed to oppose anything that signs power away from the UK and goes through the EU.

&gt;I quite like the way this  Guardian comment puts it...

It's a Guardian comment, at least run it past your own critical thought first:  ""care nothing for the low paid British workers...never spell out how, they want to help them.""

Really?    

They've never said anything how they'll help the low paid or working class?

- Proportional Representation.       
- Lower energy bills but removing green tariffs and carbon swaps, keeping existing powerstations open.   
- Lowering food bills by scrapping CAP, CFP, CET to Africa, but keeping a single farm subsidy.
- Lowering tuition fees with a view to ultimately scrapping them.    
- A grammar school in every town.     
- Directing local decisions to be made locally through localism.        
- Scrapping inheritance tax which is typically avoided by the wealthy.    
- Lowering corporation tax which is typically avoided by corporates.    
- Reducing regulatons on SMEs as lobbied by corporates.     
- Locally democratically elected national health boards to safeguard the public NHS.      
- Direct Democracy to circumvent Westminster lobbying.     
- A right to recall to keep representatives accountable to their electorate, not private interests.     
- To scrap the 'Bedroom Tax'.      
- To streamline ATOS (or its equivalent), speed up disability claims, and to put an NHS doctor in every claim to represent the claimant and not the assessor.       
- To take pressure of local services like school and hospital places, allowing them to consolidate by giving them clear projections of where future demand and growth will be.    
- To curtail wage contraction and stagnation by employing controlled immigration so there isn't a surplus in labour, or for skills not as much in demand.     
- To emphasise vocational training.    
- Scrapping employer's National Insurance.   
- Empowering local authorities to retain more locally raised taxes set locally which are typically harder for big business and corporates to avoid; geospecific taxes such as business rates and council taxes, sales taxes.     
- To prioritise affordable housing by taking large developers out it, and to open up brown field redevelopment.

There's a lot of things that they want to do to empower the UK working class and put more control back in their hands and to lower their cost of living.

And yes, before any smartarse says '2010 GE manifesto', all policies that have come about or have been promoted/spoken about, since.

&gt;They are simply shills for big businesses who are scared of even bigger European businesses.

This is some Orwellian doublethink right here.  'Big business' and 'bigger European business'.  It's all the same; internationals.  UKIP primarily supports SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises).

You seem to be under the mistaken belief that everyone is a perfectly logical being with no biological impulses, and that everyones body works the same. There are plenty of people that find it hard to control urges to eat. Sure, they could sit themselves down and plan out what to have in the house, work out the best route to work to avoid the place with the bacon sandwich aromas in the morning, etc. Nobody denies it can't be done. Perhaps you've lost a lot of weight yourself. That doesn't mean it's easy for everyone. That's why there are so many obese people, biology can be stronger than logic.

But put that aside for a moment, we're not talking about simple obesity, we're talking about people that are so obese they have difficulty performing routine tasks. Do you really think these people are happy not being able to do their job? That they haven't tried to lose weight. Of course they try, they just fail. That's what makes people that obese, not a misunderstanding of how metabolism works.

So, you have someone that has limited abilities due to a physical condition which they are not able to fix by themselves. That is a disability. They need to see a doctor. Given all that, it is entirely reasonable to protect their right to employment in law. Now, perhaps you think that disability protection should not apply to people that refuse reasonable treatment, personally I think that making what I'd consider foolish medical decisions shouldn't affect your right to work. And they can work. These aren't 400kg amorphous blobs sitting in bed receiving their monthly pay, these are real people that are likely reading these comments and feeling ashamed of their bodies and their seeming inability to effect changes in their life, that need a sturdier seat, or a hand with a couple of physical tasks.

His teammate, Moukandjo, was with the ball on the flank staring at two opposing defenders. Benny was positioned on the corner outside the box and was calling for the ball. You could see him call multiple times. Moukandjo then dribbled towards the touchline, eventually losing the ball for a goal-kick. When Benny confronted him, Moukandjo responded with this sort of ""Who, me?"" reaction. Benny headbutted him.

This normally wouldn't happen in any club-level game (maybe if you're Luis Suarez or Andy Carroll), but consider the circumstances - still having a shot in the group stage, but getting splattered 4-0 by Croatia, also with 10 men for Alex Song's... uh... moment of madness?

It's a bad *decision*, sure, but it doesn't automatically make them bad parents. People make poor decisions all the time.

Which nullifies claims that this is a money-saving measure.

I love all sports, but American football is my favorite, and if you're interested in learning the intricacies, I'm willing to bet you'd really enjoy it as well. They say it's a game of chess played by giants, which is a fantastic analogy. There are 53 men on an NFL roster, which creates a number of positions and strategies that revolve around different personnel packages and situations within the game.


It's very difficult to enjoy a sport without knowing the rules, so I'd like to direct you to [this great thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/2apejf/right_you_american_bastards_i_am_a_rugby_union/), where there are tons of helpful comments about getting into the sport. 

Further, you should know that the NFL offseason is nearly overâthere's never been a better time to make an honest attempt at following the sport (about 2 weeks till the preseason starts!). Another reason that it's a fantastic sport to follow is you only have to pay attention to 16 games (excluding the playoffs) for a single team, so you don't need to dedicate your life to be a fan. Well.... Maybe that's debatable. 

If you're interested, come over to /r/NFL and join us in discussion and game threadsâits a great sports subreddit, and we're always happy to help new fans understand the nuances of the game.

If you drive, avoid houses in Clifton. Every inch of parking is covered with Resident Parking Zones, which might sound good for you but there are a limited number of permits per house and any after the first one is extortionately expensive. It also doesn't guarantee you a space - if next door has two cars, they'll use two spaces nearby too.

Clifton rents and council tax are also insane, simply because it's Clifton. Anything closer Gloucester Road will be cheaper and about the same distance from the centre. Another good option is just south of the river in Southville: it's nicer than Bedminster and has North Street going for it.

When looking at public transport options, don't forget the rail network - you can get from Temple Meads to Clifton Down and back for Â£2.50, if the conductor even bothers coming out.

General advice for renting if you're new to it: take photos of absolutely every mark and blemish when you move in, and e-mail the photos to the landlord/lettings agent; budget for council tax and bills; pay attention to things like nearby roads/train lines and whether they'd disturb you; make sure you can get an assured shorthold tenancy - being a lodger sucks, especially if the landlord lives in the house as then you'd be an excluded occupier and have no rights at all; think about the winter and insulation/heating; never take a place where everything runs off electric on coin meter, it's a very expensive way to do things.",0,1405701229,null,0,1405701525,0,cj10mke,t3_2azkge,t1_cj10mke,t3_2azkge,null,1434778950,2,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,2

What twisted logic did you use to equate poverty with getting fat? There are fat rich people and thin poor people, so that's absolutely baffling me.

A high majority of dieters fail because they return to their old eating habits after they reach their goal weight or they give up. The solution isn't something you can sell. Who is going to market a solution that is actually free, but involves buying whole foods that aren't stuffed with sugars? Want a Weight Watchers chicken? Just buy a normal one. Fruit? Veg? Steak? Eggs? This is basic farm produce that the big companies cannot put a big markup on and sell to you as 'diet food'.

The solution that works is creating a calorific deficit, and then once you reach your goal weight, eating an amount of calories that will maintain that weight. **Permanently, for your whole life.**

The government know this, the NHS already know this. You don't have to be any sort of 'expert' to know this. The only people who don't know this, are ignorant fatties like you looking to blame everything but themselves for their obesity.

And the thing about bariatric treatment, what it forces fat people to do? Live on a calorific deficit. It's just enforcing something that anyone can do on their own with a bit of self-control.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"You have Paul Nuttall, deputy leader of UKIP, calling for privatisation. That suggests to me that UKIP policy (I'd quote their manifesto if they had one which actually said something) isn't going to be re-nationalisation. The only reason UKIP oppose the TTIP is because other European politicians are voting on it, not because they disagree on it. If they actually disagreed on it, major members of UKIP such as their leader or deputy leader, would come out and officially oppose it, not their newly elected MEP in Scotland.

Many of those bullet points are about cutting taxes across the board, or cutting taxes for businesses and assuming the free market will trickle down and lower prices, which isn't an exact science and can't be used to say UKIP are pro-working class. Of course some of them would benefit the working class, or the country as a whole, but that by no means suggests UKIP is a party primarily about helping the poor, rather that they understand their voting base is mostly made up of working class people, and need to appease them with some policies.

* Green tariffs: These also went towards new more energy efficient boilers, or new insulation, which would save money on energy bills in the long run. This is a policy that assumes if you cut costs for businesses, they will transfer those savings to the consumer, which isn't necessarily true, and primarily helps out big business.

* Food bills: Same as above.

* Inheritance tax: The threshold for not having to pay inheritance tax is Â£325,000. How many working class people have an estate worth that much? This is primarily a policy that will help the rich. They should be closing loopholes that enable the rich to avoid inheritance tax, not removing the tax entirely.

* Corporation tax: Same as above.

* Regulations: To the right, like the Conservatives, and UKIP, 'regulation' is a boo word, that reduces profit margins due to you having to do pesky things like reduce the risk your workers will be injured, or that your product will be dangerous. Again, this assume the free market will reduce prices with reduced regulations, or encourage more business, and it risks the well being of people because of it. Another policy to help those already well off, not the working classes.

* Wage contraction and stagnation: Promoting unions are a much better option for this, as this protects the workers rights even if there is a high supply of workers (which can happen without immigration). 

* National insurance: How would this help the working class? It is, again, assuming if you cut the costs for business, they will transfer as much of those savings as possible to their workers or consumers, which isn't necessarily the case. Even more so with this, where you are reducing funding to the employers and giving it to businesses. 

* Local taxes: If you're arguing it's good to cut corporation tax, as business often avoid it, then surely you'd see that they'd find a way to avoid more local taxes as well. This also ignores the trend of businesses more traffic online.

Again, as I said, yes, some of the points you mentioned would help the working classes, but it seems many major ones, like completely removing corporation tax, inheritance tax, NI contributions, and others primarily, and probably only, help out the rich. They also haven't really said how they are going to fund all this. The EU doesn't cost *that* much, and if they are also reducing taxes as well, I'm not sure how they'll afford to run the country without cutting services many working class people depend on, like the NHS (which we've seen deputy leader Nuttall wants to privatise), or schools, or benefits.

That's good for you.  But people are born **more susceptible** to becoming 25 stone than others.

Babies born to obese mothers are insulin resistant AT BIRTH.  This impacts on their energy homeostasis, tends to decrease involuntary physical activity and increases preference for ""unhealthy"" foods.

Then you'd be wrong, and they've said as much, and reiterated it again and again because Labour kept bringing it up (although they do want to start charging at the point of use).

Paul Nuttall said it but it was personal opinion not NEC approved, which UKIP members are allowed to do because they don't have the traditional whip system.

The NEC approved health message came through Dr Steph McWilliam.

&gt;The only reason UKIP oppose the TTIP is because other European politicians are voting on it, not because they disagree on it.

That's pure conjecture on your part, and certainly not what David Coburn has lead us to believe (who did say what was party policy).  

Nevertheless we have established UKIP is opposed to the TTIP.

&gt;Many of those bullet points are about cutting taxes across the board, or cutting taxes for businesses and assuming the free market will trickle down and lower prices, which isn't an exact science and can't be used to say UKIP are pro-working class. 

Actually the vast majority of them are trickle up, effecting the poorest most beneficially.     

&gt;Green tariffs: These also went towards new more energy efficient boilers, or new insulation, which would save money on energy bills in the long run. 

Hogswash.   

You don't have to take money out of somebody's pocket on the off chance they might want a new boiler.  They can buy whatever boiler they want.

Green tariffs appear on the bill ubiquitously, and they make energy more expensive and cost jobs.  It is not a policy that only saves businesses, but on every domestic fuel bill - and they're due to go up.

&gt;Food bills: Same as above.

If you scrap CET it helps developing agrarian sectors which sell onto the market.  Yes, you will see lower food costs.

&gt;Inheritance tax: The threshold for not having to pay inheritance tax is Â£325,000. How many working class people have an estate worth that much?...This is primarily a policy that will help the rich.

Plenty of people that bought their homes in the 60s, 70s, 80s, even 90s.

People with large estates don't pay inheritance because they use trusts.

&gt; To the right, like the Conservatives, and UKIP, 'regulation' is a boo word, that reduces profit margins due to you having to do pesky things like reduce the risk your workers will be injured, or that your product will be dangerous. 

This is immature and beneath you.

They want to take SMEs from under regulation that applies to corporates, but which costs them disproportionately.  They want to  push the economy more towards SMEs which is where it has been heading since the mid 90s but which the corporates have been resisting and lobbying against.

It's the corporates that are lobbying in Brussels, just like it is primarily the pharmaceuticals lobbying TTIP.

&gt;Wage contraction and stagnation: Promoting unions are a much better option for this, as this protects the workers rights even if there is a high supply of workers (which can happen without immigration

UKIP go one better and promote co-operatives, but that doesn't change the fact that controlling the labour market prevents wage stagnation and reduces upward mobility.

&gt;National insurance: How would this help the working class? It is, again, assuming if you cut the costs for business, they will transfer as much of those savings as possible to their workers or consumers, 

Because, again, it will primarily aid SMEs, and they are in competition with big businesses.   But you don't have to be rich or a big contender to own a business, but it will mean they can compete and it will mean they will be able to hire more.   

More jobs is pretty good for the working class.

&gt;Local taxes: If you're arguing it's good to cut corporation tax, as business often avoid it, then surely you'd see that they'd find a way to avoid more local taxes as well. 

That's the point.  Speak to an accountant.  Ongoing rates attached to a premises are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to avoid.

&gt;Again, as I said, yes, some of the points you mentioned would help the working classes, but it seems many major ones, like completely removing corporation tax, inheritance tax, NI contributions, and others primarily, and probably only, help out the rich.

The opposite is true. It will help the SMEs, the local businesses, as opposed to the internationals - and they're the bread and butter for working class communities.

&gt;They also haven't really said how they are going to fund all this. The EU doesn't cost that much,

They kinda have actually, and I'm surprised examples aren't brought up more often - like what they plan to do with the civil service at the MoD.

As for how much the EU costs, directly no, the EU does not cost that much.  Indirectly however Peter Mandelson himself was admitting in the 00s that EU over regulation cost the UK around 4% of GDP, and it's only gone up since.  Other economists such as Professor Tim Congdon, who was one of Ken Clarke's wisemen advisers when he was chancellor, have now put an overall figure closer to 10% of GDP which could be recouped over 10 years.   We then have IEA Brexit award winners that argue a conservative estimate would be additional growth on top of what we're already experiencing .   So there's that.

&gt;I'm not sure how they'll afford to run the country without cutting services many working class people depend on, like the NHS

Actually they want to peg the NHS budget as a percentage of GDP and be done with the whole debate.  If Local Authorities want to spend more then they'd have fiscal powers to do so.

If people want more on schools, or council projects, or whatever, then they might be advocated national cuts but they also empower localism so there's nothing stopping people from electing a real red labour or social council and using their new fiscal powers.

The original comment was:

        ""care nothing for the low paid British workers...never spell out how, 
         they want to help them.""

You highlighted contention with 8 out of 20 examples I provided (which I contested), but that still leaves the other 12 disproving the original statement.

Namely:

- A grammar school in every town

Maybe in a media personality or politician where image matters but not among the general public. It's not uncommon for an angry minority to ""cry wolf"" with claims of racism if something didn't go their way so where are these trails of destroyed careers?

Typically someone needs to be completely blatantly prejudiced resulting in media exposure before anything happens.

You are the one denying reality. Local councils are stuffed full of older generations who tend to be a little more racist than younger generations.

What fantasy world are you living in where people of his ilk are the ones pushing for political correctness?

Even if you are seriously suggesting that the human body permanently requires less calories as a result of ""extreme weight loss"" then surely the answer is to simply eat less in order to compensate?

The fact still remains that any given body requires x number of calories per day in order to survive, and any given body will consume y calories on a daily basis.

Where x&gt;y there will be weight loss and where x&amp;lt;y there will be weight gain - the human body cannot run on thin air and it's remarkably good at storing excess calories for the lean times to come.

Loads of people voted in a poll for a banner that *didn't* have the crest (which is further down the page anyway), which didn't have all the trophies. Clearly most people don't regard those aspects to be particularly important in what makes a good banner or this one wouldn't have won. Listing some requirements rather than a blank slate first might have been a better way to do it in terms of creating more targeted and quality submissions to being with, but it seems a bit weird to claim the winner is wrong just because requirements never existed.

Personally I like it (as I do the other two in the top three, though mamadou's was stretched). It looks elegant and isn't distracting from the content on the page, or overly busy or amateur-looking, which I expect is what appealed to other people too. I don't want one with a dozen graphics trying to list the entire history of the club in it (plus loads of photos of the Kop because obviously that's important too).

Unless you're claiming *all* the entries were shit there's really no way to argue that this shouldn't be the banner. Democracy has spoken.

Portsmouth, under our former manager Harry Redknapp, went this route. They managed to win the FA Cup, but ended up owing  Â£135 million. They went into administration (bankruptcy), were relegated three times, and are still picking up the pieces today.

Around ~2001, Leeds United took out massive loans, expecting to make the Champions League. They narrowly missed out two years in a row and couldn't pay back the loans. They started having to sell players to make payments, which led to multiple managers wanting out... which eventually led to a relegation in 2004. They also eventually went into administration and were relegated to League 1.

We have large scale unemployment already, and this is only going to get worse. There's more supply than demand for unskilled labour, and this too is only going to get worse. Because of this, it's going to be difficult for unskilled workers to meet their living costs: we already need to pay them tax credits and housing benefit.

So in the present system the only way to make work pay is to cut the benefits given to unemployed people to a lower level than the benefits and pay given to unskilled workers. This is already too low, so that's a non starter. 

The only thing that would remotely help to make work pay without continuing the current race to the bottom is some sort of basic income, and that's not going to happen any time soon.

[This](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1105816) study shows dysregulated neuroendocrine appetite machinery a year after weight loss.

This [review](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn.obesity/2013/210524/#B65) documents a very large number of processes which kick in to restore weight.

&gt;Even if you are seriously suggesting that the human body permanently requires less calories as a result of ""extreme weight loss"" then surely the answer is to simply eat less in order to compensate?

Yes, of course.  BUT, what everyone on here doesn't seem to understand, is that the entire feeling of hunger can be altered by obesity and weight gain/loss.  You could have the strongest will in the world to eat less and still fail if you were dealt the wrong hand regarding the wiring of your hypothalamus.

&gt;Many people regain weight that they lose purely because the never learned to accurately count their calories and ensure that once they lost the weight, they didn't resume their consumption of excess calories.

As the paper above documents, this is much harder than it seems, as our bodies tend to suppress energy expenditure to compensate when we lose weight, so the number of excess calories alters accordingly.

Do you also know what ""mediocrity"" means? It's average.

Henderson is not better than Wilshere. He may have had a better season but Wilshere is simply miles better technically and would be a better impact player. Yes Henderson is better defensively and tactically, but you can get an actual DM on the bench instead if you want to see out a game. That is why Wilshere would be more effective as an option off the bench than Henderson.

Our defence isn't that good or well organised tbh, and with Debuchy replacing Sagna we'll only get worse now we have two fullbacks very average at defending.

And no, Steve Bould doesn't deserve praise for that defensive improvement over the last few years, Wenger does.

&gt; Maybe in a media personality or politician where image matters but not among the general public.

You are a moron if that is honestly what you believe:

http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/03/04/sears-racist-remark-facebook_n_4891948.html

http://www.asylum.com/2009/07/10/can-you-be-fired-for-being-a-racist-on-your-own-time/

This is without mentioning the recent UKIP councillors and previous councillors of all parties who've been fired.

&gt; Local councils are stuffed full of older generations who tend to be a little more racist than younger generations.

They are also stuffed full of left wing public sector types just itching to be able to accuse their political opponents of racism and who thereby prevent people from having an open and honest conversation about important issues like this for fear of the consequences. Perhaps if councils were free to address the problems in their communities they wouldn't be ""verging on Keystone Cops""

&gt; I guess you might be new to the world of local politics and are giving it scrutiny for the first time.

Projection? 

&gt; Not everything is a conspiracy.

At the risk of repeating myself ad nauseum, There is no conspiracy, it's simply the way things are.

&gt; Where are the examples of people saying ""I tried to raise this 10 years ago but could not""... Where is the proof that allegations where rejected because of fears of ""racism""?

[You mean like the example we are talking about in Birmingham](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-26883618)? 

&gt; By 70 year olds like William O'Rourke who believe that nine year old girls ""wanted it to happen""? Are you serious? What fantasy world are you living in where people of his ilk are the ones pushing for political correctness?

I believe this tactic is called derailing and is traditional when one has lost the argument and so tries to create straw men and utilise ad hominem arguments to sway the topic to other areas.

&gt; Take the police for example, they have been proven to be ""institutionally racist"" on many occasions yet there is the claim they choose to avoid arrests on allegations of ""racism""?

And indeed to stop and search non-BME groups so as to keep their statistics looking less racist than they actually are. Luckily for women the cops haven't been criticised for gender discrimination yet.

&gt; Sorry mate but your argument is rejected by all available evidence.

I'm not trying to argue there isn't a societal issue, but at a fundamental level, there's no-one force-feeding a person. It's entirely their prerogative to consume or not consume as they see fit, and as a result I feel it's a issue of personal responsibility. If it were everyone, I'd agree that ""humans (as a whole) just aren't capable of losing weight in our current obesogenic environment"", but as long as at least one person can and does lose weight, then it's indicative of the fact that the only (insurmountable) factor stopping the others is themselves. If you want to lose weight badly enough, you can. Certainly 66% is an alarming statistic, though. I'm no biologist though - is there a reason a person absolutely couldn't lose weight, regardless of their actions?

I guess I'd compare it a little to smoking - in 1954 in the US, smoking was at 45%. Now, it's at 21%. And the percentage of people who have never smoked is increasing as age decreases (I got that from [here](http://www.gallup.com/poll/109048/us-smoking-rate-still-coming-down.aspx)). Why was it so societally popular in 1954 and it's half as popular now? And can we do something similar with obesity? 

Personally, I feel most people now know someone, or know of someone, who has died from a smoking-related illness (Apparently one in five deaths in the US is smoking-related), while the relative recency of obesity means that comparatively fewer people know someone who has died as a result, which would have an impact on their decisions and lifestyle, and I would expect the obesity rate to fall as it causes more deaths.

true,pairyhenis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire (Soton and a bit of Wiltshire),"&gt; I meant a sort of generic ""you"". Sorry if that wasn't clear.

Ah thought you might!

&gt; I'm no biologist though - is there a reason a person absolutely couldn't lose weight, regardless of their actions?

No (barring some rare conditions), but that isn't really the point - for some people it's harder than others, and generally it's hard regardless.  Societal and personal pressures make that harder, and we end up with a population net weight gain - even then, net weight gain is on the order of 0.5kg a year, which equates to (roughly) a daily excess of 10kcal (just to give you an idea of the chronic minute margins we are dealing with!)

It's indisputable that we are naturally disposed to weight gain, on the whole.  If one person can lose weight, that's great, but it's not indicative of the ease with which others can too.  This excellent [review](http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/20/3/166.full) discusses the variation in weight loss even when individuals are given identical calorie deficient diets, yet the similarity in weight gain/loss between twins, highlighting the contributing of genetic variance.

&gt;Although all of the individuals in the study consumed the same amount of calories for the same amount of time (approximately 3 months), there was a large variation in the degree of weight gain, from 8.8 to 29.3 lb, among different individuals. However, the amount of weight gain was very similar within each twin pair. The reverse also holds true. When moderately obese monozygotic twins were kept on a low-calorie diet, the amount of weight loss varied greatly among different pairs of twins. However, within each pair of twins, the amount of weight loss was quite similar.

I should be clear that, yes, superficially, the only individual making a person obese is themselves.  However, that ignores both the neurological/metabolic mechanisms I've detailed and linked to above and the societal pressures that influence consumption of excess calories and lack of energy expenditure (of which advertising and marketing of foods/drinks and their acceptance in our culture, combined with a general decrease in daily energy expenditure play major roles).

You're smoking example is pertinent, and highlights the role that industry plays.  No one developed more self control, or stopped being ""lazy"" to resist starting smoking - society began to frown on tobacco consumption, and sales and advertising afforded to it were dramatically stripped back as a result of government intervention.  That's what needs to happen to control obesity.

I agree. Scotland doesn't have disproportionately less MPs than anywhere else, nor do those MPs have less power than MPs from elsewhere.

&gt; Building on that perhaps the UK government isn't well set up at the moment but the answer to that is not independence.

I guess this is where opinions vary. I would like to live in a country with a written constitution, a proportional voting system, and one without an unelected second chamber.

The chances of that happening within the framework of the UK are nil (primarily because the elements that would need to change to make that happen are exactly those elements which currently hold political power).

What the fuck is immature about not extending your contract, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that because it is a career decision. And actually its a brilliant one

This is a copy paste from another user's comment on this thread but it sums up Lukaku and his agent's decision perfectly.

&gt; If he waits until after this season is done he can decide whether or not to renew. All he cares about is playtime, not money. Sure if he renews now he can get a lot more money, but the club could hardly use him the entire season and he would have no power to leave. Renewing now is like a blind leap of faith. Waiting until after this season puts him in prime position for a move away if Torres and Costa block him out of the team and puts him in more enticing position for a new contract renewal if he plays very well and gets decent pitch time.

All parcels imported from outside the EU valued over Â£135 are subject to import duties, import VAT and a clearance fee. We will hit them one by one, then I'll give you some tips on what I think is probably going on. 

Import duties are a messy clusterfuck, and depend on what you're importing, and where from. There are thousands of different codes for different classes of goods and from different places, it would help to know what you've imported and where from, I might be able to give you a better idea of what percentage you should be paying for this. 

Import VAT is the VAT you would normally have paid for importing your parcel, so usually 20%, but with some exceptions and caveats. The fact that your VAT fee is so high suggests something isn't quite right, but we'll come back to that. VAT on a Â£170 parcel should come out at Â£34 (normally). 

The clearance fee is basically the fee HMRC charges for the privilege of looking at your parcel, and is Â£8 for all standard parcels. 

A Â£250 VAT bill would suggest that the revenue have valued your parcel in the region of Â£1250, so something looks fishy here. I can think of two possibilities that could have happened. 

1. The sender has incorrectly or illegibly completed the customs deceleration. This seems to be the most likely outcome, as you haven't been charged by royal mail for resealing the package. 

2. The package has been opened by HMRC, inspected, and they've decided that it is worth more than it is. Unlikely as you usually get charged to wrap it back up!

So, you need to complete a [form BOR286](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/forms/bor286.pdf), enclose a copy of your receipt and a brief description of what you think is wrong and send it to the address on the form. You only have 30 days to get this sent off from the date on the letter/postcard/bill thing that you received. I would send it recorded delivery, but you sort of have to consider at what point you're sending good money after bad. You will have to pay some import duties and import VAT, plus the Â£8 clearance fee too, so keep that in mind.

Wilshere has obviously had a long stagnation in development but I wouldn't say he is ruined as of yet. He's still a better passer and dribbler than Henderson and IMO more effective in the final third. 

Wenger is the manager who buys the right players for the system, trains them and picks who's first choice etc. How do you know our assistant manager is the only one who trains them?

Arteta is a very good DM when partnering Ramsey. Vs Liverpool at home, Dortmund away, and the two Wembley fixtures Arteta was one of our best players. When partnering Wilshere or Flamini though he is usually terrible as JW doesn't defend and Flamini is shit going forward meaning Arteta usually have to attempt to play two roles at once and always gets exposed/dispossessed.

Is an outdated attitude that lead to more deaths in the Titanic disaster and is no longer kept to.

&gt; * Are at greater risk of being physically assaulted

&gt; * Are far more likely to go to prison

Few of these are directly the result of cultural prejudice against men. The work one is true to a degree due to gender roles.

&gt; * Make up the vast majority of the armed forces

Again, due to gender roles in part, but also sheer physical strength, which is something we can't really blame society for. 

This is more due to discrimination against women than it is discrimination against men, though.

&gt; * Extremely less likely to be cared for stay at home househusbands

Are we to treat being a 'house spouse' (heh) as being a positive thing? Granted, I can see your point here, but this is likely, again, due to discrimination against women. Because home is seen as the domain of the woman.

&gt; * Far less likely to retain custody of their children in the event of a split with their partner

That actually is a good point.

&gt; * Lack any sort of social movement to fight for their rights and against gender roles. Men are still pretty much stuck in the 50's in this area.

Utter and complete nonsense. There are plenty of men's movements but the media ignores them. There are also male feminists.

&gt; * Are less likely to excel academically in further education

Most likely not due to prejudice against men, but worth thinking about.

true,MonkeyPope,null,null,"I am not saying it's not difficult, but someone who backs out of doing difficult things simply because they are difficult is usually described as 'lazy'. I do appreciate how hard it must be to undertake such an effort, to lose weight, and I would absolutely support anyone making that change. 

You're absolutely right - there are other factors at play here than simply one's desire to lose weight, but I feel like those are surmountable issues, with the onus falling on the obese person to recognise them. For example, if I were overeating because I were depressed, simply trying to stop eating as much probably wouldn't help me. In that case, I've got to look at myself and think ""why am I doing this?"" and try to solve the main problem. It's still personal responsibility, but the issue isn't necessarily as simple as just obesity. 

Similarly, I appreciate that genetics play a role. But if someone is putting on weight even if they're eating a normal diet, then they should recognise that and adjust accordingly. Different people need different diets. 

I feel like we're broadly agreeing here - nobody can change an obese lifestyle but the individual concerned. I view that as the definition of personal responsibility, it's up to no-one but them. But you're right - it absolutely could and should be easier, with government intervention and stronger support groups. People who don't want to change never will, but we should make sure that people who do want to have every opportunity of losing weight.

true,ggow,null,null,"Maybe but one of the proposals is Prestwick Airport. That has a rail line and a major road network and is only half an hour way from Glasgow by motorway/ dual carriageway. Similarly, Leuchars Air Base is 15 minutes from Dundee, 40 from Edinburgh and is 5 minutes from a large ECML station. Those two sites are also quite close to deep water poets, if anything need be delivered by barge. Additionally, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and St. Andrews are all home to excellent (top 150 in the world) Universities whose expertise could be drawn upon. 

Looking to future infrastructure, as HS2 is rolled out, times to London will begin to drop from 4.5/5 hours one way to as low as three and a half or reed hours, depending on how far the high speed connections are rolled out. Glasgow and Edinburgh are also home to the UK's fourth and second busiest airports, respectively, outside London. 

Ease of access obviously depends on where you're coming from but Bristol and Norfolk aren't necessarily easier or quicker to get to than those two sites for most people in the UK/the World. The other four proposals, obviously, are in the middle of effin' nowhere, on peninsulas, islands, or miles from any large city.

Even without the lack of examples from places with these laws already in place, safeguards will suffice to avoid this, I think. Private audiences with physicians, psychologists etc. 

Continued adherence to that view is, to my mind, the dismissal that ""We know what's best for you."" from the people who are against it. Seeing as that's the whole point of the bill in the first place, I don't think that defence holds water.

I wonder, though, if people who worry about the vulnerable can meet anyone who is, right now, adamant that they want the right to die and come away thinking ""No, they're being coerced."" What's different about those people, then, that it's so clear they *want* to die?

Something to consider: while the ""vulnerable"" argument might be considered to hold up for a time to come, I don't think it will in a few short years. I for one will make it clear to my GP etc. that should I ever suffer a particular illness, disease or similar, then I will want the 'right to die' option available to me. I imagine that many other people will too. In that sense then the number of coerced people may well be 'spottable'.

But I would also like to see the law extended. For example Tony Nicklinson wouldn't have had the right to die if this were passed, as he wasn't ""terminally ill"" afaik.

There's a reason why he's played so little over the past 2 seasons and imo it's only partly because of injuries. He's a fan favourite that made his debut before the mega money takeover - he should be playing more (9 PL appearances in 2 years). 

Why isn't he? He's missed out on a lot of match time that he would have needed to develop - which as a defender is so crucial. Consistent injuries have also probably lessened him as a player, not just physically but mentally too. I think a good comparison is with Martin Kelly. Looked great a couple of seasons ago, then after a couple of injuries, he's not even half the player he once was and will probably be shipped out. Richards is just an extension of this - he's been in limbo for longer.

I have *literally no idea* why people actually want this guy.

My feelings about Northern Ireland are that the English government have historically screwed over Ulster, as hard as ever they could.  Pretty damn badly with the rest of the island too over a long long time.

I don't look down on the people of Northern Ireland, Catholic or Protestant.  It is a beautiful place that I would be very interested to visit, history, landscape, people and culture.

I frown on people who use violence to make their feelings on the past known.  I can't help but wonder if they have taken an eye for an eye too far, if they have made it personal when it was institutional.  But I am not and was not there so what do I know?

If we keep Demichelis for another three years by the end of it he will be making way for Bossaerts or whoever else it may be. This is most likely why the board signed an older Sagna.

This a nice project we have here, but absent Suarez there are no other really infamous players in the group. We mostly have great prospects, players who while on the cusp of greatness have not yet established themselves on the continent. Not really their fault, if we had European footy last season every team would be more aware of how splendid our football was last season but the absence kinda meant we slipped under the radar. 

I don't think any properly established stars will come here unless they want the pressures which come with being the primary figure of the team. Glamorous it might be but it's still a role you'd rather fill on occasion rather than every time you lace up.

Good. Good start. 

**Essential players :** 

* Petr Cech - Legendary goalkeeper for the past 10 years


* Dider Drogba - Legendary striker, left in 2012 after scoring the winning goal in the champions league.

* John Terry - Captain, Leader, Legend. Been with the club since 1996 I believe, is club and team captain and a great defender. He had to retire from internetional football due to claims of him being racist, which he was eventually cleared of.

* Frank Lampard - Left this year, but always will be remembered as one of the best. The highest scoring Chelsea player ever, highest scoring midfielder and also a general legend like Terry.

* Ashley Cole - Left this year, one of the best left backs ever seen, joined from Arsenal in 2006.

* Eden Hazard - Currently Chelsea's best player, plays left wing and is one of the best dribblers you will ever see. Top scorer last season

* Giofranco Zola - Forward, one of the best Chelsea has ever seen. Weaved in and out of defenders, was very similar to how Messi is now. Shirt number 25 was unofficially retired in respect to him. 

**Old players**

*This is mainly important players from the 60s,70s,80s,90s.*

*Might have missed a few, it's late at night ;)*

* Peter Osgood - Striker, fan favourite. Scored many goals.

* Peter Bonnetti - Goalkeeper, only had his record taken this year.

* Ron 'Choppa' Harris - Full back/Centre back, known for his pretty brutal tackling style, this is how he got the nickname 'Choppa'. 

* Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink - Extremely strong and powerful striker from the 90s. 

* Claude Makelele - Defensive midfielder, this position was nicknamed the ""Makelele position"" as he made it his own.

**Staff Members**

* Jose Mourinho - Manager, loved by all in Chelsea, hated by most others. He's a very funny man but can take it a bit far sometimes, but we always love him. Was in charge 04-07, then rejoined us in 2013 after stints at Inter Milan and Real Madrid.

* Roman Abramovich - Owner, transformed the clubs fortunes in 03, buying the club and allowing us to challenge for the title. Also signed Mourinho.

* Steve Holland - Assistant manager, not legendary, but still an important member of staff to know.

* Rui Faria - Another assistant manager, again not legendary, but still important. Very flamboyant.

**New signings this year :** 

* Nemanja Matic - Defensive midfielder, played for Chelsea previously but didn't make the cut. Now one of the best in the league.

* Mohammed Salah - Right winger, 22 years of age and one of the quickest players you'll see. 

* Cesc Fabregas - Celery

* Filipe Luis - Possibly the worlds best left back

* Diego Costa - A great striker, 25 years old, 36 goals in 56 games last season. Is a bully.

* Courtois (Not a new signing, returning from a loan) 2nd best goalkeeper in the world.

* Lukaku (Not a new signing, returning from a loan) A very good striker, only 20 years old and also like Diego, a big strong guy. Scored 15 EPL goals last season.


**Squad/Loans:**

http://i.gyazo.com/9f28a3ba84542119fda3547664cc3254.png


**Recent History :**

* 09/10 - Last won the EPL

* 2012 - Won the Champions league

* Finished 3rd in the EPL this year. Couldn't beat the small teams. 

**Useful information:**

* Chelsea fans generally hate Tottenham Hotspurs fans. Also we hate Man united fans, and we hate Arsenal. Fulham is our little brother who needs a bit of TLC. 

* KTBFFH (Keep the blue flag flying high) You will see this a lot on Chelsea posts, it's a sort of signature for Chelsea fans I guess. Liverpool have #YNWA (You never walk alone) and some other clubs have their own variants.

* Chelsea play at Stamford Bridge. Often reffered to as ""The Bridge"". 

* Chants : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DAqpftt4yY

* Song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g1iTxIk0YE
* Song 2 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZYfi_Ex_gM

By all accounts, Andy got paid 80K per week last year. That's nearly 4.2M for the year. To appear 15 times and score twice. When Andy played West Ham went 5-1-9 (W-D-L).

How does that break down? 277K per game played. 693K per goal created. 2.08M per goal scored. 1.04M per assist. 832K per win. 260K per point.

Yes, there is a lot more to the game than scoring and assisting goals. We all know Andy is a world class aerialist. However, the fact remains: That's bad business. Any way you slice it that's bad business. 

&gt;Carroll was the big English signing he is not going anywhere soon and our owners will not sell at a lost.

No, the board doesn't want to take a loss on Carroll. Nobody wants to admit they have egg on their face. But how long does bad business go on before you have to admit you've made a mistake?

&gt;We sign one striker and reddit wants Carroll out and sold while West Ham forums believe we are wasting our money on that new signing

Yeah, some of the boards think Valencia was a waste of money. I don't mean to insult KUMB, but the majority of the lot on that website are xenophobic and refuse to believe someone from outside England could ever be better than someone from within Her Majesty's borders. Makes me wonder if they aren't the ones on the English Visa approval board.

They're wrong, of course. Valencia and Zarate were brought in because Carroll has not been worth what we've paid. Competition may light a fire under him, or he may break a nail on the way to the training ground. Who knows. But competition was necessary.

You do know that at one point in US history there were more *white Irish slaves* living in America than there were free men there, right? All at the behest of Britain. There's also that famous politically incorrect saying that ""The Irish are the [n-words] of Europe.""

Colour doesn't come in to play with Britain and Irelands history, our conflict has always either been about religion, political ideology, and land, or a mix between them all. Palestine/Israel conflict is similar to that in that it is Political Ideology, religion, and land are all brought to the foreground of the fighting. South Africa is similar to us because of the quasi-apartheid state we had in the North, catholics were frozen more or less out of the political process and were treated like the black people of South Africa.

Second of all, you have to separate your needs and wants. Do we really need Reus? We have so many attack minded midfielders already. Do we need another one? Our priorities lie elsewhere.
What we need is a striker. We just sold Borini, so the need for a striker has grown that much more. I just looked through all the top teams and top leagues and there is no star striker that is available. Falcao? Massive wages and after his injury, I'd be concerned. Ibra? Massive wages. Who else? Everyone else is taken, just moved or we won't be willing to match their overinflated wages.

We have to settle for a squad player or someone with noticeable potential. Griezmann? Remy and Bony depending on the price? Maybe Doumbia? Hell, what about Chicharito to mess with the mancs (probably get downvoted for the last one).

There aren't that many options.

We should invest into a good fullback. I'd go for Pisczcek if he wasn't 29. Still, if he can be bought at a cut price, I'd take him. Moreno? Durm? Rojo?

&gt; Read up on your history, son.

To quote your link there;

&gt; They came to Ireland and mixed with the natives of south and west, who themselves are supposed to have been from low type and descendants of of savages of the Stone Age who in consequence from isolation from the rest of the world had never been out competed in the healthy struggle of life and thus made way according to the laws of nature for superior races.

Okay, so thats just like [this.](http://imgur.com/a/6Wqg5#0) That is propaganda.

It's designed to drum up support for acts of savagery toward people you don't like - that is its design. Just like the Yanks in Vietnam made sure to get it into their soldiers heads that the Vietcong were *vermin*, literally a lower species than man. That allowed US soldiers to literally collect the heads of fallen Vietcong, boil the skin off the head, and keep the skull as a souvenir. They spread that propaganda, but they went to war with Vietnam to eliminate communism there - that is their alternate reason.

Maybe the rumour that we were somehow blackwhite (*grey?*) or whatever the fuck you want to call that caught on, but whoever first made that shit up had *alternate* reasoning, I'd go as far as to say whoever came up with that theory was very chummy with the government. Everyone that came after the theorist was just caught up in the propaganda storm.

City haven't. Arsenal still need a striker. United have bought a competent midfielder and left back. Chelsea have bought a striker who had a decent 18 months but has looked poor since his injury. Fabregas is definitely an improvement. 

If you think that our team needs a marquee signing in order for them to get excited about the new season then you're mistaken. Suarez leaving alone will give them all a point to prove.

You're going to be very depressed, mate. We're not signing a big name. I'd come to terms with it. I'd also accept that a successful season doesn't rely on a single player.

City weren't. And that's who we almost beat to the title.

You suggested that feminism is inclusive of male equality (or, at least, their goals, see above). Given the eponymous nature of /r/feminism, again, it's no large leap to suggest that /r/feminism should be representative of feminism as a movement, and thus we come to a paradox: feminism includes male issues, /r/feminism bans male issues.

 For Chelsea any striker is a huge improvement, I doubt Costa will score 25+ goals but we'll see I suppose. They also signed Felipe Luis so Azpilcueta can play on the right again so now they have an attacking threat from both fullback positions. 

City are signing Mangala for Â£30m odd and they'll probably add another 1 or 2 decent players, they'll still have the strongest squad I think.

Even United are set to bring in at least 1 big name, maybe even 2.. so they'll be a huge threat too.

I wont be depressed if we don't sign a big name, but of course I'll be much more confident if we do.. as of now it feels like we're going to have to rely on Markovic quite a bit.

Yup but Arsenal, Chelsea, United and Spurs all collapsed at some point in the season, I'll be very surprised if that happens next season.

Err we don't have a decent left footed winger as of right now, maybe Lallana but he'll most likely be in the midfield 3. He's relatively cheap and young too of course.

I don't think I'm underrating the side, I just feel as if we'll be in for a hard battle for 4th if we don't bring in the right players and if the window goes as  planned for other clubs.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"I think the 4-3-3 will be used as often as the diamond 4-4-2. Rodgers is clearly a fan of the diamond since it allows you to focus most of your play centrally, and that means getting the ball into and around the penalty area which is a key part of why we are as prolific as we are.

Sturridge will be the main forward in the 4-3-3, but I wouldn't be surprised to occasionally see Remy as one of the widemen, he can play there and his goal threat is a great asset like Suarez was notably vs Everton and Spurs. 

Then you'd say Remy would be backup to Sturridge, perhaps rotating that role with Lambert who would mainly be used for the cups.

When we play a diamond I think Lambert could be quite useful, he has exceptional link up play and can find his strike partner really well (10 assists last season).

Still, no self-respecting man will wear pink, amirite? Pretty sure all these males have more self-respect than you do, considering you seem to be incredibly insecure of what other people may think of you wearing a specific colour.

Which brings me on to my next point. It's a colour. A colour like red. A colour like blue. A colour like green, and a colour like yellow. Wearing pink doesn't make you any less 'manly' than wearing brown would. **They're fucking colours.** Get your head out of your ass.

Besides, your point is invalid. Spurs aren't an American team, and besides Lloris during this tour, we won't *be* wearing pink in the states. Grow up, child, and stop being so worried about what someone may think of you because you're 'wearing a barbie colour, and should have a matching handbag and heels lol fag'. Fool.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"&gt; Loving the squad depth now, we have lost Suarez but the difference between Remy and Suarez is lower than the difference between Moses/Aspas/Alberto and Lazar/lallana/Lambert.

Great point.

I also agree about Remy featuring quite often ahead of either Sterling or Markovic for his goal threat.

Both are very good goalkeepers at their peak. Sometimes one of them plays, and the other sits, although it's normally good for injuries. Fernandez was injured at the beginning of the year, and thus Seitz started, and everyone's fine. Now Seitz is hurt, which is fine because Fernandez can start. Also, when one of them is going through a bad run of form, they can be benched.

World class player made available, only one recent memory is Ozil that came out of fucking no-where (again due to being listed and the clubs having easily agreed on fee). Has to be forward or defender (we aren't getting worldclass midfielder as long as Gerrad starts and Lallana/Coutinho/Hendo remain highly rated).

Defenders: Benatia (being put on window practically and has set price), That wolfsburg LB (has also set price), one of BVB CB that is demanding transfer, pretty much. 


Anything other player I can think of will not be rated that high by the fanbase and would just fuck their reputation (TAW). After all Willian, Mkhi were surprise but not shocking, Costa came out of no where and was much better link.
