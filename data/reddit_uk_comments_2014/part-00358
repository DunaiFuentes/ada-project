A lot of this objection stems from the younger generation thinking that social media is some kind of game.

Personally I believe that's a reasonable income for a single person to live fairly comfortably. But I wouldn't be expecting to buy a house, lets put it that way.

I believe the average UK income is £26,500

To put it into perspective, I grew up with my parents and it'd be fair to say we were poor for my of my childhood but by no means borderline poverty. My father can't work and the household income never went above £23,000. When my mother was on that income we were living very well, at least compared to what we were used to a few years earlier. It's very 'do-able', even when supporting a child and another person. But comfortable? No - we were getting by.

But for a single person? I'd say comfortable. 

Your opinion on this will be very dependant on where about in Canada you are from and where in the UK you will be moving to. My girlfriend spent a year in Vancouver and when I visited her the cost of many daily 'must haves' were way above what I would expect to pay in North West England, groceries seemed especially expensive. Other things seemed considerably cheaper, fuel for example (looking at the internet petrol is around 1.18CAD/L in the Vancouver area at the minute. Where I live in the UK it's 2.17CAD/L.)

false,pairyhenis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire (Soton and a bit of Wiltshire),"Obesity is a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental pressure.  One without the other won't lead to obesity; either you'll be able to accurately regulate your food intake and energy expenditure (ie, via having a wonderfully robust set of genes by chance), or you won't have the environment to drive energy imbalance (ie, you work hard physical labour with little food in the 3rd world).  

Unfortunately most people have genes optimised for storing food, living in an environment that massively supports a positive energy balance (hence why 2/3rds of the UK population are overweight or obese).  

Genetic influences alter appetite, feelings of hunger and satiety, desire to exercise, non-exercise activity (fidgeting), the energetic cost of metabolising food and the energetic cost of keeping warm.  Genetics can't magically make someone 300lbs, but they can, for example, make an individual have a reduced sense of feeling full in response to eating, or reduce the 'drive' for physical activity.  

For example:
Individuals with certain variants in the FTO gene, comprising 15% of the population, which alters appetite, are 1.6x more likely to be obese than those without at-risk FTO variants.

They did not adjust for other components of their diet. This makes it impossible to say whether diet soda caused their waistline to increase directly, or if diet soda drinkers are also people who eat more in the first place.

Voting behaviour shows otherwise and in any case the modern media environment renders that impractical. 

Which is probably for the best. Have you spent much time reading statutes? These are not simple documents. Your average amateur politician is going to be completely reliant on advisor (lobbyists) and whips when dealing with such documents. Your more professional politicians with their degrees in law and politics and their decade as someone's researcher at least has a theoretical chance of understanding what is going on.

Throw in all the other parliamentary procedures, rules and conventions they have to deal with and the volume of stuff they have to cover and the amateur politician has largely had his day.

&gt;A novice pilot would scream 'we're going down!' as he realises he's about to crash a plane. A politician would delay and waffle and dodge the question, until the plane actually hit the ground.

I will point out that both scenarios have the same end point. You also underestimate the modern politician. Of course the plane is crashing.

false,bigjo66,eng-lestershire,Leicestershire,"The nationalists try and set up their own government in Manchester, and groups of military personnel defect to them in significant numbers. As they make moves to capture as much military equipment as possible fighting breaks out. Foreign governments are unsure how to react, but Russia, seeking to recruit an ally and split up NATO, send significant support to the Nationalist government, who they officially recognise.

Both sides start arming as quickly as possible but the Scottish government, trying to keep out of the fighting, declares independence. When the nationalist government sends in troops to suppress this violently, the uneasy peace comes to an end and fighting breaks out in central England as well, with a major push by tanks and mechanised infantry south, towards London by nationalist forces, which is barely held off by the 'royalists' as they become known. Cities of the midlands become a quagmire, especially Birmingham, which is the scene of heavy fighting.

An SAS assassination attempt against the nationalist President gets botched, and only results in the death of his wife and grandchildren, provoking a ruthless crackdown against all potential 'traitors' in nationalist territory. Eventually this descends into thousands being arrested, there are show trials, and even summary executions. 

Royalist forces launch a major counter-attack, with Royal Marines landing near Edinburgh helping to push nationalist forces out of the area, and an armoured push up through lincolnshire and then west, cutting off a lot of the nationalist army. 

A group of nationalist security officials, now fully aware of their governments complicity in various atrocities in the name of weeding out traitors, decide to use turn the new laws giving them virtual police state powers against the nationalist government. They kidnap and then execute the nationalist President, and with conspirators in the nationalist army, launch a coup.

The fighting ends in a truce, with most of the nationalist army surrendering anyway. The Royalist government stays in office for many years afterwards without any elections, to try and stabilise things. Scotland's status remains very complicated, not wanting to rejoin the Union but facing a bleak economic reality to rebuild on its own. 

The story ends with a resurgent Russia, pretty much responsible for the ferocity of the civil war in the UK since they armed the nationalists, annexing the baltic republics and Belarus.

false,Ardal,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"As u/Dardonator says below, if the train operators owned the infrastructure they would not be inclined to open paths to new services from other operators (or totally new operators) When Hull Trains was starting out GNER tried to buy up all the available slots on the east coast, not to run trains on them, just to stop Hull Trains from getting going. It ended up with a good battle down at the office of the rail regulator with Hull threatening legal action before they finally got their paths. Ironically Hull joined GNER in trying to prevent Grand Central getting off the ground when they wanted east coast paths some years later.

Railtrack became the scapegoats for the failings of the initial rail  privatisation in the UK. More than 30 years of underinvestment (so both major political parties with virtually no investment at all in some years) meant the infrastructure itself was falling apart...badly. No government could afford the enormous bill to rectify it (remember they work in very short term thinking, unfortunately the rail industry works very long term and the two were just not compatible) Railtrack were handed a rotten bag of shit infrastructure and within less than a year were being blamed for poor train times (which were actually much better than BR ever managed) Political pressure to be more punctual &amp; more productive was immense, changes to unofficial  'double blocking' that signallers used for additional train protection resulted in the Southall crash adding to the pressure on Railtrack, there was the Ladbrooke Grove crash (Paddington) A result of poor driver training and failure to identify and mitigate multi-SPAD signals (both of which were part of the BR designed system, the Hatfield Crash was a result of gauge corner cracking but Railtrack were working to BR standards for rail replacement times (though they could have done better) This was followed by Great Heck where a guy crashed onto the railway resulting in a major accident just outside Selby. 
It was a fucking terrible time for all of us in the industry, were were devastated from top to bottom as major incidents rolled in at a chronic rate, every single one of us wanted to make it safer but lack of investment for decades takes decades to repair. We made massive strides in rail safety, we reduced SPAD risk (Signal Passed At Danger) by 80% in 5 years as well as shortening rail replacement times (from the BR standard)  and undertaking the biggest rail replacement program the industry had ever seen. We made massive improvements and were continuing to do so UNTIL the European rail interoperability regulations came into force around 2006, to ensure all european countries could reach the 'standard' the requirements on UK rail safety were actually eased in a few places, as soon as they were the Network Rail internal oversight team was disbanded as the regulations removed the requirement for it (something Lord Cullen specifically stated was required as part of his investigation into the Ladbrooke Grove accident)
The onus now is on each individual company to ""self determine"" meaning they are responsible for their own safety measures (which was the case before that string of accidents caused Lord Cullen to recommend oversight. 
There has been massive investment, the latest is GSMR Global System for Mobile Radio, this makes great leaps in safety and is currently being rolled out across the whole network, in time this will lead to ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) where the requirement for 'coloured lights' to signal trains when to stop and go will not be needed, this will massively improve both safety and performance though it will take another 10 years at least. When it is in place it opens the door entirely to automatic trains with no driver (who it the most expensive and unreliable part of the system) 
UK rail continues to grow and its people continue to work really hard to improve safety (that's all people from cleaners to CEO's, they all actually genuinely care) nobody comes to work thinking lets risk some peoples live today, in fact in rail operations there is a saying.....""would you let your wife and kids get on that train, if not then why the fuck would you let someone elses wife and kids get on there"" 
Both performance and punctuality is getting much better but always remember in the UK we are literally working on victorian infrastructure (tunnels bridges etc) the track can't be widened to remove bottlenecks because politicians in the late 60's when oil was cheap and cars more popular than trains cut the shit out of the railways and sold the land to developers, now there are houses in the areas that rail could have really used and 20 million NIMBYS preventing any expansion. 
It is a massive, wonderful beast of a thing, fantastic to work in and frustrating as fuck.

I have personal experience, and never once needed to reference Wikipedia, one such source is the [Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2083/pdfs/uksi_19992083_en.pdf):

&gt; Unfair Terms

&gt;5.—(1) A contractual term which has not been individually negotiated shall be regarded as
unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’
rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer.

&gt;(2) A term shall always be regarded as not having been individually negotiated where it has
been drafted in advance and the consumer has therefore not been able to influence the substance
of the term.

...

&gt; SCHEDULE 2

&gt; INDICATIVE AND NON-EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF TERMS WHICH MAY BE
REGARDED AS UNFAIR

&gt; 1. Terms which have the object or effect of–

&gt;(e) requiring any consumer who fails to fulfil his obligation to pay a disproportionately
high sum in compensation;

You're the one trying to pass your own opinion as fact here, I'm relying on knowledge of the law and successful case history . I've represented myself in magistrates courts and used Money Claim myself successfully as claimant against other companies...

I certainly hope that claim form wasn't against you and that you didn't pay it because if you did you've unnecessarily lost a lot of money through your own ignorance.... and if that's the case, stop now, save yourself further embarrassment in your vain attempt to justify your post-purchase dissonance.

I think the important mention of thalidomide is here-

&gt;Each time a new form of risk has been found in
a class of products, a new layer or branch has been added
to the regulatory system to ensure that future products
will be safe from that type of defect. For example, following
the discovery of birth defects caused by thalidomide, all
new drugs were required to be tested for teratogenicity. 

Fracking has an unknown consequences and until we fully understand it, there isn't enough legislation to reliably mitigate risk.

What did the Guardian say about thalidomide?


&gt;Thalidomide was one of the worst drug scandals in modern history, killing 80,000 babies and maiming 20,000 babies after it was taken by expectant mothers.

They've not mentioned the key point - thalidomide was rushed to mass market, becoming an over-the-counter medication in a short time period before the adverse effects could be known, before there were mechanisms in place to protect people. It's a terrible thing, but there was no need to put the figures there, in that way. Walport didn't do it because he wasn't comparing the consequences.

There was more emphasis on it in the book version of *Family of Blood* than the episode, but I like the idea that the persona the Doctor assumed as John Smith was a facet of his real nature rather than a purely invented character. John Smith was who the Doctor might be, if he were a human man with a human life and experiences. A mortal with a limited lifespan, no Time War PTSD, no great perspective from having seen all of time and space, just an intelligent and decent man doing his best.

I like to think that Yana!Master was a manifestation of who the Master might have been under different circumstances. Yana didn't hear the drums. Yana wasn't warped by being mind-raped by Rassilon at the age of 8. What does a sane and mortal incarnation of the Master spend his life doing? Tries to help people and get his ship flying, oblivious to the affections of his adoring assistant. He's practically a human version of the Third Doctor.

I imagine Yana might be similar to who the Master was as a very young man, before his megalomania and insanity, back when the Doctor first knew and loved him.

what happens when you get another car for another £900, minus the £200 scrap value for the one you refused to repair which brings it to £700?

now you have to phone your insurance and change it and get either a partial refund or pay a partial extra depending on the make, model and engine size and emissions it produces.

you also have to pay for a whole year's worth of tax as per the new rules that came in from the gov / DVLA this october.

all of that has to be done before you inevitably run into the typical way of life when buying a used car on the 2nd hand UK car market - it will have one or some problems with it almost guaranteed.

you may not notice it immediately but you will soon. then you are right back where you started. are you going to yet again refuse to fix that one?

you get what you pay for. £900 for a used car is going to come with some baggage. in fact, any price for any used car UNLESS it's an approved used car from a manufacturer showroom WITH a warranty will always have some baggage.

you just have to roll with the punches. fix it and you then at least know your car and it's characteristics. it most likely won't develop any problems for a long time after that fix.

of course it will develop typical wear and tear problems but that's how it is with every car. owning a car means you will have to fix it, regardless of it being brand new or used - cars break and they need fixing.

no car reaches 300k-500k miles without replacing or mending anything. you just have to accept that fact.

i bought a 1998 honda civic 1.6 ESI 4 door hatchback last year. over the year i have spent maybe £4000 on repairs.

i have had to:

- have x2 brand new rear wheel arches made and welded in
- a new front brake disc caliper fitted
- a new starter motor
- a new engine distributor (£913, more than what you paid for your entire car)
- a new catalytic converter
- a new thermostat and engine fan controller
- a new ABS sensor

you might ask why did i pay for all of that when i could have just bought another car? well, that other car could have still cost me all of that over a long period of time. this car displayed all it's problems to me from year 1.

now it's running fine, i probably wont have to pay anything major for 10+ years. it's also only 81K miles on the clock and runs like a dream and is a honda civic.

apply this mentality and you will do much better financially and you will be more at ease with your car.

£500 for some repairs is peanuts. fix your car. run it. get your money's worth. chopping cars in for scrap value and moving on and on to car after car is a complete waste of money.

buy 1 car, and fix 1 car. keep 1 car. that is all.",0,1417216702,null,0,false,0,cmfnrno,t3_2no3rc,t1_cmfnrno,t3_2no3rc,null,1425796268,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

During the actual legislative process, though, the party whips are involved, which means that MPs are fairly efficiently corralled into voting.

At the beginning of each week, the party whips send out a message to all of their members with the votes (or 'divisions') that are going to happen that week, ordered by their importance.  You may have heard of the term ""three-line whip"", which comes from the fact that the divisions deemed the most important by the party are underlined three times on that message to stress that MPs MUST be there.  MPs have occasionally been disciplined by their parties for missing three line whips or voting the wrong way.

Now, a consequence of the whipping system is that MPs don't necessarily have to have been in the chamber to vote.  There are division bells around the Parliamentary Estate that ring whenever there is a vote, and when they do, MPs will drop everything and run for the division lobby they were directed to in the whips' note - they have 8 minutes to get from wherever they are in Parliament into their respective vote lobbies before the doors are locked and no more members can vote.

YES, this means that MPs often (more often than not, in fact) vote without having been in the chamber to hear the debate on the issue.  This may seem odd, but that's the party system for you - when you're voting for a party at an election, remember that the party's views have primacy (this is why a change of Prime Minister can happen without an election in this country - we technically vote for the party, not the person).

What you usually see in these ""look how few MPs turned up to decry kitten shredding, the heartless, robbing BASTARDS"" pictures are Backbench Business debates, which are usually held on Thursday afternoons.  That's important for reasons I'll come back to.  These are just debates on issues, rather than a vote on legislation.

The motion being discussed in the image above was:

&gt;That this House has considered progress of the historic child sex abuse inquiry.

Important though the issue is, I'm sure you'll agree that it doesn't require all 650 MPs to agree to it.  What the headline should be is ""look at these few dedicated MPs making sure this important issue remains firmly on the agenda"", but that isn't exactly exciting.

The reason Thursday afternoon was important is that MPs are generally in their constituencies on Fridays, and many have constituency work from the morning, so they travel there on Thursday afternoons.  For many constituencies in Scotland and the North, this takes some time.  This is exactly *why* the House is discussing Backbench Business (as opposed to legislation) at that time in the first place - *because* many MPs won't be there.",0,1417218693,null,0,1417279122,0,cmfoo0z,t3_2np39a,t1_cmfoo0z,t1_cmfo1av,null,1425795849,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

I'd suggest looking at a Honda Deauville. That's a 650 or 680cc V twin tourer, fully faired and with panniers. It's not the most exciting of bikes, but it has a rock solid engine and shaft drive. With the sort of winter mileage you're doing, that would save money and time on chains. Most of them are over your price range, but there's one in Motorcycle News for £1000 at the moment. It's said to be economical, it's certainly reliable, and it would be a nice tourer for the summer as well. People do complain about it being a bit dull, but coming from a 125 you should find it pretty sprightly.

The SV650 is more at the ""fun"" end of the spectrum. A very good bike, with quite a bit more power and higher fuel consumption. Chain drive, and it looks as though setting the valve clearances during servicing will take a while, hence more expensive.

Do you turn up to every single meeting that goes on in your company? Even stuff you know nothing about and are not responsible for? If your company is private I bet it has an Audit committee did you attend that? That's the role these committees play, a scrutiny role for outsiders to look at government policy. It is not appropriate or the role or responsibility for all MPs to turn up to backbench committees (that's why they are called the Backbench committees, its for backbench MPs...it's kind of in the name Backbench Business Committee)

Certain issues and devolved off to committees. These Committees examine and scrutinies government policy or proposes changes or new laws. These are made up of a cross section of MPs responsible for the remit of that committee. If every MP turned up to every committee, well that would be daft now? The reason so few MPs turned up is because they are not on that particular committee. There are processes to the parliament believe it or not, if this committee feels this issue warrants further attention it can be escalated or play a part in wider policy/law change in due process. 

&gt;We've empowered these people to run an entire country.

Well to be honest you elect your local MP to represent your constituency,so if they were spending all day, everyday at committees they couldn't really do that now could they?

It's important for character development to be done on screen. We need to witness the character's inner struggle so that we maintain our connection to them, so that we fully understand the character's transformation and simply because character transformations are heart and soul of stories.

Sure your Trenzalore explanation could roughly work, but it's not without it's problems. We didn't see a dramatic personality shift until the Doctor regenerated. Also, Rory didn't seem to suffer a Capaldi-esque transformation during his long vigil, so the precedent within the show's internal logic is that people can wait around for centuries mentally unscathed.

What I'm saying is that Doctor Who is so full of contradictions, inconsistencies and plot holes that you can't really apply logic to fill in the gaps. You just have to suspend logic and go along for the ride. This conceit gives a lot more flexibility in storytelling but it confers a duty on the writers to explicitly show you anything that you need to see to understand the plot or what's driving the characters.

If Moffat thinks his plots are neatly constructed mysteries that make perfect sense when enough intelligence is applied then he's just deluded.

So by losing the sponsorship they lose the money they paid out to become the sponsor plus a potential drop in revenue by losing the marketing stream created by the sponsorship.

Spurs will be able to find another sponsor with little issue, BassBuds will be out a nice chunk of change and still have the potential for a lawsuit from Spurs hanging over their heads.

To be honest, I only follow what the government does in the sense that I read popular news stories and sometimes watch HIGNFY. I don't really know what he's been doing.

Maybe that's the fault of the media for not giving him enough attention, or maybe it's his own fault for not really putting himself out there. I've seen clips of him doing shows on talk radio, so it looks like he might be doing what he can to get his messages out to the public. 

I'm also not sure how much power he gets as the Deputy. His party only has 1/6 and 1/5 of the amount of seats that Tory and Labour have so I guess his influence probably doesn't count as much even though he has the 'Deputy Prime Minister' title. 

As for his views, out of the 3 main leaders I think Clegg's are the closest to my own, and I feel like I'd personally get on with him more than Miliband or Cameron too. 

He is a bit of a sap. It does sometimes look like he's depressed and he definitely isn't as charismatic as Dave. But he does come across better than Ed Miliband in my opinion.

I think he'd be fine if he had more say in policy, but I suspect any drastic ideas that he has would just be ignored. So he's trying to subtly bend Tory standpoints towards ways that he sees as being fairer.

This was a Ballot Bill.  At the beginning of every session of Parliament, backbench members wishing to introduce a Private Member's Bill apply to do so, and their names are put in a big pot and drawn in a ballot by the Deputy Speaker.  You can see the results of this year's ballot [here](http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/ballot-faq-page/).

Because of the limits of Parliamentary time, only the first couple really have any chance of getting all the way through Parliament before dissolution.  With the upcoming election, Parliament is due to be dissolved at the end of March, which doesn't leave a great deal of Parliamentary time to get through all the different legislative stages.

This bill was seventh in the ballot.  Without Government support, it didn't really have a snowball's chance in hell of making it into law.

To address a couple of points from the article:

&gt;Only 60 of our MPs showed up today to debate this. Where were the rest of them?

In their constituencies, where they usually are on Fridays.

&gt;write to your MP and get them to bring this bill back to life

The Bill is not dead.  It will not be dead until either it's voted down or this Parliament ends without it being passed (which was likely even if there had been a vote on it today).  It will be debated again next Friday, and there's a chance it will get to a vote then... that doesn't change the fact that it doesn't have a chance of being passed into law without Government support, though.

A more apt question would be ""why are MPs from the governing party filibustering a law to protect tenants?"" or perhaps ""why are we relying on Private Member's Bills to protect tenants in the first place?""

By all means write to your MP and ask them to try to get tenancy protections written into their party's manifestos for the upcoming election, but it's a bit excessive to say this was a bad day for democracy as this Bill was never going anywhere to begin with...",0,1417230481,null,0,1417231656,0,cmftmuf,t3_2npdzp,t1_cmftmuf,t3_2npdzp,null,1425779125,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

For sure.  Among internet communities based around professional sports, it's one of the most amicable, thoughtful, and un-cunty places out there.

With that, I recognize that you're offering suggestions to marginally improve what is already a very good forum, and I don't think your points are *wrong* per se, but let offer a little rebuttal nonetheless:

1) I don't think this happens as much as you might think.  It sounds like you're talking particularly about Eriksen v. Hull and Kane v. Villa.     Kane's ratings for the Villa match are indeed a bit odd, and there is clearly emotion behind some of that (unsurprising, given how badly we needed the victory).  Otherwise, though, 10s are extremely rare and generally occur at rates that one would expect.  To wit, 15% of Eriksen's ratings against Hull were 10s, but they actually fit into an approximately normal distribution centered slightly below 9.  Same thing goes with, for example, Kane and Lamela against Asteras -- tons of 10s, but their distributions are basically normal with extremely high centers (in a 5-1 rout, no less).

2) A few people, maybe, but I really haven't noticed many people moaning about GK heroics against us.  Not like last year.

3) Yes, this happens a bit.  But as Natrolleon observed, knee-jerk reactions are a staple of the internet and of large groups in general.  To me, this place is one of the least ""knee-jerk-y"" places on the internet, and the comments almost always end up skewed more towards the voices of reason than towards the voices of hysteria.  All things considered, this one of the strengths of this community.

Things could always improve though, which is of course the point of your post.

Personally I'm actually in favour of tuition fees rising. I don't think that the rest of the population should be paying for people's 'Surf Science(!)' degrees at low-ranking Universities. When I went, it seemed like my (shitty) University was inventing soppy courses and letting as many people on to them as possible so that they could profit and pay some bloke who made an arthouse film in the 70s £100k a year to be a professor. 

If you've actually learnt worthwhile skills on your course then the increased salary you receive should be worth the cost of the degree. If you don't earn over a certain amount then you won't have to pay it back anyway. 

People make the case that it isn't fair because it stops people studying subjects like Art and Literature, therefore harming the cultural growth of the country. But have a look at what academia has done to contemporary Art. It's shit. Having a degree doesn't necessarily make you any better at progressing culture. 

That's not to mention that if you have an Arts degree from a decent Uni, it will still help you with landing a higher paid job.

Reina was all set to jump ship so we needed a keeper. What grinds my gears is we apparently refused to pay £15 mill for Begovic so settled for Mingolet. 

The Agger point is also not relevant. He was constantly injured and said himself that he couldn't handle the premier league anymore. His replacements have been shite but let's face it, most of BR's signings have been. 

The Sanchez for Suarez issue is also not relevant. Sanchez simply didn't want to come to Liverpool just like Costa, that Armenian bloke (couldn't be arsed attempting to spell his name), Salah, Willian, Ericksen and all the rest we've been linked with. The only way these type of players will join is if we fling huge wages at them AND sign players of the same calibre. I'd question whether Suarez would have left had we bumped up his wages again and started buying Fabregas, Costa, Sanchez, Bale etc. That's how Man City suddenly started attracting players despite the fact that Manchester is a bit of a dump. 

BR can definitely be blamed for a lot that has gone wrong but there's no point whipping him for some decisions that were outside his control.

false,languageuse,null,null,"As promised, I will provide you with some raw results of the survey I conducted in October this year. As I’m sure you understand, at this point I cannot offer any specific information of the data, as my thesis is not yet published. The information provided here cannot be used for any research. 

The survey gathered over 1600 responses. Approximately 50% were native English speakers,  about 40% native Finnish speakers and the rest bi- or multilingual. About 45% were females, 55% males and the rest did not want to specify their gender or their gender was other than female or male. Only about 10% of the participants were over 50 years old, and 54% were in the age range of 31-40. Approximately 70% of the participants had some college or university level education and 35% has studied Linguistics.

The survey concentrated on the masculine generics he and man (and their variations), and options that could be used instead of these. Question 2 asked the participants to choose from different sentences, all stating approximately the same thing. 55% chose “All people are created equal”, 25% chose “All men are created equal” and 16% “All human beings are created equal”. The other options, “All mankind is created equal” and “Humankind is created equal” gathered 3% and 1% respectively. 

Question 4 had variations of the 3rd person singular pronoun, when used to refer to a generic antecedent (If a student drops a pen, [] should pick it up). 82% chose the singular they, 12% the generic he. 4% chose the option other, often suggesting the use of he or she or she or he.

The second part of the survey asked the participants to define who belongs to groups such as mankind, women, men etc. The results confirm that the use of masculine generics is contextual, as women are not included in men all the time. Approximately 90% of the participants felt that both men and women belonged to the group mankind, but only about 40% felt women belonged to men in the phrase “All men are created equal”, and 20% in the phrase “All men should vote”. In the phrase “All men have freedom of speech”, almost 50% of the participants felt women were included. The phrases “All women are created equal” and “All womankind is created equal” were seen to refer to females only, as expected.

The third part of the survey provided statements and the participants were to indicate whether they agreed or not (Likert scale was used). 94% of the participants either somewhat agreed or strongly agreed, that language can affect the way we think and our perception of things. 60% either somewhat agreed or strongly agreed that gender equal language use is important.

The last question was, whether a new, gender neutral 3rd person pronoun could be added to English. Approximately 30% answered yes (but it is not needed [16%] or it is needed [15%]), and 39% no (it is not needed [31%] or but it is needed [8%]).

Once again, I would like to thank everyone who participated. The amount of participants was a positive shock, and I’m also very thankful for all the feedback. My thesis will be finished at the latest in May 2015, if you want, I can post a link to it then if you are interested.

&gt;

&gt;__Padley Gorge__ is a deep but narrow valley in the [Peak District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_District), [Derbyshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire) between the village of [Grindleford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindleford) and the A6187 road.

&gt;The gorge is wooded with a stream, the [Burbage Brook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbage_Brook), at the bottom. This stream used to form the boundary between Derbyshire and Yorkshire but the boundary now follows the [Hathersage Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathersage_Road_(Sheffield\)) ([A625](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A625_road)).

&gt;Padley Gorge begins near [Grindleford Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindleford_railway_station) at a stile where a post has been installed. Although the valley continues up towards Hathersage Road and Burbage, the gorge finishes at the edge of the woodland. Padley Gorge forms the backbone of several walks in the area  and the railway station approach road forms a convenient car park for walkers.

false,evi1eye,eng-kent,Dartford,"Jews are a people, not just a religious group. They trace their ancestry back to the biblical ""children of Israel,"" that is, descendents of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (whose name was changed to Israel). One is a member of a tribe by being born to it, regardless of beliefs or practices, much as one is born Swedish or Italian, without regard to beliefs. 

The strict Orthodox definition of what it means to be born into the Jewish tribe (dating back at least 2,000 years) is to be born of a Jewish mother.  This makes you Jewish enough to apply for Israeli citizenship, for example.

Ed Miliband is Ashkenazi Jewish. **In an ethnic sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is one whose ancestry can be traced to the Jews who settled in Central Europe.** For roughly a thousand years, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews.

[A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews#cite_note-88)

One can also become Jewish through conversion, however for the last 2,000 years conversion to Judaism was a rare occurrence. It has become more common these days.

So, if one can convert to Judaism, how does one stop being Jewish? Well, if one was born Jewish, then generally speaking, one doesn't. Even if one converts to another religion, it does not take formal conversion to return to Judaism. So mere passive non-belief in God (or even active agnosticism or atheism) does not negate one's Jewishness.

All that has to do with who is Jewish, but there's little about belief unless someone *converts to* Judaism.

Belief is almost irrelevant to Judaism. Abraham is not told to BELIEVE in God, but to walk with God. What is important to Judaism is action, not belief. Doing the right things for the wrong reasons is viewed as sinful (or at best, ambiguous) in Christianity; but in Judaism, doing the right things for the wrong reasons still means you've done the right things. Thus, being Jewish is not about believing in God, but about doing the right things. (I decline to get into the discussion of what the ""right"" things are, since different sects of Judaism have different thoughts on this issue.)

Thus, it is not inconsistent for an atheist to be Jewish. ",0,1417258751,null,0,false,0,cmg1p1x,t3_2nnxpx,t1_cmg1p1x,t1_cmfprgj,null,1425771926,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Most of the students have a BSc, some have experience, some have a Master's. I have noticed a lot of them did their BSc in the UK, that probably helps. But there are plenty who haven't.

If your BSc is strong, then I think the main issue for you would be funding.

At my university, a Master's with a conference publication seems to be necessary when going for internal funding, which is shared across all departments, making it competitive. They also tend to be more likely to approve students for partial funding who have been funded elsewhere for the first year. But I have no idea what this is like in other universities, and even our department has a slightly different filter process before the university stage.

As others have suggested, finding a department and making contact with some potential supervisors is the best thing to do. They'll have an idea of the options for your field.

At the end of the day, if you can find a willing supervisor and the money, you should be fine.

Luke Garbutt was great, the game was similar to the one at Goodison in that they created a lot of chances and Garbutt had to be on his toes defensively, marking their best players - Kevin de Bruyne in one half and Perisic in the other. He also managed a few good runs and ovelapped Mirallas to give options in attack, as well as a few marauding runs out of defense with the ball at his feet. 

Hibbo was Hibbo, Jags and Distin were solid, Osman played well too. I actually thought Eto'o didn't have a great game, he surprisingly gave the ball away a few times, but he wasn't terrible.

I don't think that the BBC is now bereft of comedies and I'm not even sure if they are few and far between since the comedies you mention span over almost 20 years of television.

You could probably say competition has played a role, such as Channel 4 (which is partly funded with tax payers money) who have probably created some of the better comedies over the last 10 years. Also comedy central UK is now becomming a player in giving more adventurous comedies an airing since the fall of BBC 3. 

I think the problem may also lie with tastes and attitudes and diversification of T.V. and the BBC in general. Since the BBC provides a broad range of entertainment both on television/radio and internet and still maintains a high standard of comedy on Radio 4. 

Finally the T.V. license has been frozen for 4 years? With the BBC forced to moved to Manchester which may have put a lot of avant garde comedy on the back burner for safer bets and guaranteed viewership to justify their income.

The point is however that women's participation in the workforce can not provide an explanation, since it is not reproduced across countries. This proves that in the US studies there was no ceteris paribus and explanations must be searched for elsewhere.

B) There is sexism everywhere, it's not hard to find, it is the nature of our society, same as racism, classism and a ton of other wrongs. We're getting better at it, but it's still there. I honestly have no idea why people get their panties in a twist when something that should be pretty obvious to everybody and decidedly well-established is pointed out. I'm also not entirely sure why you don't think gender equality, in the workforce of all praces, is not an economic issue.

C) I think you're a bit confused. I'm not implying that there is an effect in the US that does not exist in Europe because Europe is less sexist. I'm suggesting that the automatic reflex of blaming phenomena such as child obesity on the advances of gender equality despite lack of supporting data is an instance of our society's sexist hangups. Because honestly, this harkening to a past that only ever existed in 1950s American sitcoms is rather silly: most women have always worked, the only limitation was ever in what professions and for how much money. And if a modern working class family were likely to be satisfied with the tiny hovels with zero modern amenities that men could afford to pay for on a single salary in the past, I'm sure that's still possible. But we're not, we want more. And, if you care to look at statistics on improved life quality, we're actually getting more for our work too. But sure: it was all so much better in that non-existant past.

false,joshuawakefield,1905,,"Chelsea head into match week 13 on rampant form, yet Sunderland could prove to be their most testing game yet.

Buoyed by the fine form of new signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas, the Blues have picked up 32 of a maximum 36 points and look likely to extend their unbeaten run at the summit.

Few punters would bet against Chelsea in their current form, but Sunderland have proved themselves capable of an upset in the past few seasons, most memorable being Sunderland's 3-0 victory in 2010 at the Bridge, and the 2-1 win in April which ultimately sealed Chelsea's trophy less season.

With only Ake missing due to injury, Jose Mourinho looks likely to continue with the same starting 11 that faced Schalke on Tuesday. 

Both Costa and Fabregas have proved themselves irreplaceable in the squad, while Matic's strength and ability to pick a pass has caused havoc on opposing teams this year. Even Willian, whose form somewhat  faded in and out last season, has been impressive. Maybe not the most naturally technically gifted player, Wilian's work rate and understanding has grown immeasurably.

Sunderland, currently 14th and unbeaten in 3 matches, are without Emanuele Giaccherini, Billy Jones and former Chelsea player Patrick Van Aanholt.

Neutrals should enjoy the match, with the last 12 Premier League fixtures resulting in 53 goals.

Kick off is at 5:30 GMT.

* Bulgarian rather than Belgian
* It was Moreno's man at the near post not Manquillo's

That said, re the 2 goals.

1st one: Yes, Mignolet should have taken that one, agreed. Failing that, it's a bit hard to blame the defence for the running man. We spend a lot of time doing a defensive retreat (running toward your own goal while facing the play) because we play a higher line and we allow a lot of counter attacks to develop. 
  
It's really hard to man mark when you're doing a defensive retreat so I can't blame Hendo, Manquillo or Skrtel for not tracking the runner. Mignolet should have pushed the ball wide if he couldn't catch, end of. 

For the second goal, the blame should lie with Gerrard and Moreno,  as you rightly state, but that's all. Everything after that is just probabilities and it worked out well for Ludogorets. If you watch the replay, Allen wouldn't have stopped that header even if he was where he should have been.

One other thing I noted was that we seem to do a lot of work down the left of the pitch, not just in this game. This makes us very predictable as we offer less threat down the middle without Sturridge, and definitely not on the other flank. 

This makes us very reliant on how well Raheem (or Lallana or Coutinho) is playing down that way. Any thoughts on why this is?",0,1417262626,null,0,false,0,cmg2bfn,t3_2nqjmc,t1_cmg2bfn,t3_2nqjmc,null,1425771637,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

* It gives the mods more work to do, since doesn't it mean they have to look at every single news post, and then figure out whether it falls under news or politics? That will only lead to arguments.

To add on to that, people underestimate sides far too much. For example Newcastle, I saw someone said we were going to get Pardew sacked and since Leicester (16th October) they've won 6 games in a row in all competitions including beating City in the league cup. Also this isn't Fifa, you can't expect to drop in players and for it to work. Some giving Soldado seemingly endless amounts of time yet Paulinho, Vlad, Kaboul, Naughton, Townsend, Rose? Nothing of the sort, you can tell they'll never improve but Soldado's just round the corner.

People calling Eriksen ""world class"" and giving him 9s/10s most of the time. Yeah, no. World class is being some of the best in that position in the world and he has a long way to go before that. He needs to both improve and vastly up his consistency and he needs to not shy away from tackles and headers. He doesn't compete in the air at all, he doesn't even try to occasionally, it looks like he's afraid of getting hurt. Not every save Hugo makes is world class. Keepers block shots, that's what they do. Yes, he is one of the best in the league (along with Courtois who's top imo, De Gea and probably Cech) but making a  routine save =/= world class. He needs to work on his weak foot too holy shit.

Hindsight is 20/20 for sure. It is difficult to mark the moving man closely for Manquillo as the player is already at pace, but given that I didn't see any form of effort from Henderson I'm of the opinion that he could have at least put the attacker under some pressure from behind. There's got to be something there.

As for the left side theory, I think it's part confidence and part strategy. I'm sure the team has had success in practice playing down the left and eventually getting the ball across. Johnson is great at running overlaps with Sterling/Coutinho/Lallana and putting balls through deeper into the corner. 

But in-game it becomes sort of psychological. If you get the ball in midfield and you have the option to go left or right, which way are you going to go? Towards the player(s) (&amp; Johnson I suppose) who are the young, pacy, 'proven' talent who looked pretty in their run last time? Or towards Manquillo or (in this game) Henderson who looks sort of panicked every time he touches the ball in the final third?

 Then it just becomes perpetuated: players on the right might try to do more when they get the ball because they get chances infrequently and inevitably make an error. Maybe they get the ball across - but thinking hypothetically there I'm not sure I've ever seen Raheem head the ball lol.

You squeeze the ball through, he'll beat the last man and score or his initial run into the box id the poached goal. Now he has to adapt where he has to sleep in the box while the entire team sits in the opponents box and the opponents are in perfect shape, one of the most difficult thing to do for a striker like him and still he makes the run and score.

Most US tv doesn't operate like that. Perhaps the smaller stations or late at night, but they do that here as well.

Major networks aren't dissimilar to ours in terms of show length/advert ratio. The real difference is most major US networks have shorter but far more frequent adverts during normal TV viewing times (i.e. not stupid 0'clock)

Take hour long slot shows as an example. They have roughly the same runtime in both nations, normally somewhere between 40minutes to 50 minutes. 

An Idiot Abroad runs for 43-44 minutes per episode, the rest being adverts compared to Bones, which runs for 43 minutes on average. 

Another example would be NCIS, runs for between 42-44 minutes. Compared to The Bill (when it was still on) which had a runtime of 42–46.

For example, British people queue. It's not because we crave order, it's because it's fair. We have a welfare state to help those in need because they need that chance. We give immigrants a chance because we believe in it. We're polite because we're considerate. We're also shy because we're considerate and don't want to annoy people. 

The NHS is a huge part of our culture because it embodies all three of these. We have the same access healthcare - it's fair. If you're sick we take care of you, you get the chance to recover from cancer or whatever irrespective of who you are. And it's free because that's the considerate thing to do.

&gt;1st payment to OS: if a member of the public wants to submit a Planning Application they can buy a site plan map, usually from the council (cost of about £25 for an 4 x A4 sheets) or other OS licenced data reseller.

&gt;2nd Payment to OS: the Planning Authority (local council) also have to buy their map base from Ordnance Survey every year. Part of what is called the Mapping Services Agreement (MSA) [and a whole other debate hangs around the MSA - CA].
3rd Payment to OS: the member of the public also pays for Ordnance Survey data as part of their normal taxes.

&gt;There is also a 4th Payment (which is the biggest scandal) that goes to Ordnance Survey and the Post Office, to use our council-created and council-maintained Local Land and Property Gazetteer (LLPG) or local address database. Even though all the councils create and maintain their own address gazetteer, we have to pay the OS and Post Office for the privilege of using that address data.

&gt;The OS says that it owns the copyright of the position of the address, and the Post Office says it own the copyright of the address (because it adds the postcode). Councils therefore have to pay a per-click cost to OS and Post Office to use the council-created addresses on our own website address lookup facilities.

&gt;The irony about all this is that the local council creates the address in the first place (Street Naming and Numbering sections) and gives (for FREE) this information (including site plan) to the Post Office and Ordnance Survey – so they are in essence charging the local council for its own information. Therefore the public have to pay the Council to create the address (Street Naming and Numbering dept) and then pay again to the OS and the Post Office for the right [for the council] to use it.

&gt;Now, if the council wants to use Addresses (LLPG) created by a neighbouring council(s) (eg for cross-council working/Partnership working etc) the cost goes up even more. The tax payer has to pay the council to create the address data (Street Naming and Numbering dept), OS and Post Office to use the address, and again if used on a web address search facility.

&gt;Then a neighbouring council will have to pay extra money to the OS and Post Office to use the same address (if it’s not in its postcode area) and finally pay again to use the address in a address search facility on its website.

&gt;In total the tax payer could pay up to five times for the one address that the council gives to the OS and Post Office for FREE.

&gt;Finally, taxpayers putting in a planning application online for one building/address using OS data could be paying a total of up to eight times for that one address/building data. Now that is scandalous.

I take a different view on Westminster too. There may be many muppets in there, but it is the crucible in which the laws of the land are made, amended and repealed. Refusing to take part isn't ""skipping the circus show"", its leaving your constituents with no representation as laws are made that will impact, potentially negatively.

Lets take a practical example. 

Sinn Fein have chosen to publicly dig their heels on welfare reform this year.

But surely by all acounts it could have been more effective if they'd: 

-taken part in the time consuming but important line-by-line scrutiny of the actual Bill when they had the chance to in Westminster. 

- tried to galvanise cross party opposition before the second reading vote.
 
- tabled important amendments

- and more generally, contributed to the public debate at the crucial time when the Bill was on the floor in front of the elected representatives of the people. 

But their ""high principle"" mean they weren't there. 

Their seats in the chamber, as empty as a lawyer's soul.

Call me cynical, but it feels like it was just more politically convenient for Sinn Fein to sit back in their leather chair offices in Westminster, watch the Bill pass and then pose themselves as champions against it 2 years after the time when they might have actually done something effective.

[Office of National Statistics has shown dramatic increase since 2012](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30224493)

&gt;There are numerous studies that show EEA immigrants are net contributors to the UK treasury, theoretically some of that money could have been used in the past 10 years to alleviate some of those logistic issues.

Thats easier said then done. Having money and having the ability to build new infrastructure are two separate things. The amount of work that has to be done to: 

* find a site, 
* get building regs, 
* get funding from the local trust
* get the green light from the local trust/council

It's a long and drawn out process and its one that migration outpaces. It's all well and good thinking                                     'More Migrants = More Money = More infrastructure' but that's very flawed reasoning.

I saw something posted the other day where kids at school were asked to find their ""Indian name"" by taking their initials and coming up with plants or animals that started with their letter. Not only insensitive, but utterly devoid of any relevance to real Native American history or educational significance whatsoever.

As a parent to be it's weird to try to figure out how to deal with this when it happens at school...and I have a feeling it will. My next door neighbour's kids goes to the school mine will and they were all dressed up as ""pilgrims and Indians"" for their thanksgiving, turning a genocidal history into a nice little game for kids to play. I'm just hoping I can instill a little more tact and realism in my child at home. 

Personally I plan to approach and celebrate thanksgiving more as a harvest festival, which appeals to me much more as it bridges the country gap, goes back much further (I'm way more into ancient history then the colonial period) and doesn't have quite so many troublesome implications. Perhaps I can teach my son or daughter about harvest festivals throughout history, the pilgrim one being part of it. :)",0,1417269069,null,0,false,0,cmg3k01,t3_2nnl3q,t1_cmg3k01,t1_cmg00ri,null,1425771059,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Hate crime is not any bigger in NI than it's ever been, it's just less savoury to see when Huns v Taigs has become Both v Foreigners.  It's an issue that will always need to be tackled head on, and there are three issues stunting that; a) paramilitary-pandering politicians keep making up the government, b) completely decent people in urban areas -  the vast majority of the people there - are still too tolerant of murals and terrorists claiming ""their area"", mostly because of the third point c) a pathetic and cowardly approach from the police in dealing with the last dregs of paramilitary utter scum we haven't yet taken the opportunity to completely purge from society yet.

Patrick Yu hit on one of the ways in understanding the issue;

""Most of the available housing stock for private rental just happens to be in loyalist areas where there is already a wariness of outsiders and a feeling of being left behind by Catholics who they believe have benefited disproportionately from the Good Friday Agreement,” he said. “There is still huge deprivation in these areas, and I believe sectarianism and racism are two sides of the same coin — both need to be tackled.”

You can see this very attitude in a recent instance, where a woman in an estate in the east of the city picketed a house a relatively new arrival to the country was given by the housing association.  BBC NI asked her what she was doing, so she complained about waiting lists and genuinely couldn't see what she was doing as racist.

If we could start tackling social issues in the centre of the political system, and not allow the violent regressives claim they have the solutions and cynically manipulate people with nothing to lose (it's happening on both sides), then we'd move forward.

I play a 4-3-1-2. Few players on the bench are Ruben LC, Kalas, Perica and Pasalic. 

Was actually tough trying to make this team. I wanted to try and fit Solanke, Brown, Piazon, Traore, Boga, Musonda, Baker and Chalobah all into one team. Came to the conclusion I had to either drop the wingers in favour of a 4312 or drop Brown/play him on the wing and drop either Piazon or Traore, would also then need to drop one of the three midfielders or put Chalobah at CB and have no physical presence in my midfield.

imo the reason Gerrard has been starting nearly every game is that we are very lacking in a DM role which is where it appears Rodgers wants Gerrard to play.  Lucas is hit or miss in my opinion but Gerrard while not great defensively always offers at least a small amount of attacking threat.  We have 2 players that Rodgers wants to use as a DM but they aren't at all similar players which makes it hard to just rotate them with each other.

They should include the opposing views anyway, especially if there's evidence to support the claims:

&gt;Gaddafi's administration had repeatedly asserted that the rebels included al-Qaeda fighters.

&gt;Denials of al-Qaeda membership were issued by the rebels. Gaddafi's claims are supported by a secret cable to the State Department from the US embassy in Tripoli in 2008 and an analysis by the Combating Terrorism Center at the US Military Academy at West Point of a set of documents called the Sinjar Records, purporting to show a statistical study of the al-Qaeda personnel records.

&gt;A disclosed file from 2005 on WikiLeaks found that rebel leader Abu Sufian Ibrahim Ahmed Hamuda Bin Qumu was a former Guantanamo Bay detainee alleged to be a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, to have joined the Taliban in 1998, and that he was a ""probable member of Al Qaida and a member of the African Extremist Network.""

Where is the evidence that Gadaffi was bombing his own people?

I mean, it's so obvious, just look at the GNC, they have voted for Sharia law and made it illegal to support any of Gadaffi's policies. Um, what, I thought Nato was fighting to overthrow an oppressive regime, yet they're quite happy to let the GNC waive all democratic process and take power despite being defeated in an election?

&gt;[Sadiq Ghariani] subsequently used his presidency to manipulate the GNC agenda to the advantage of Islamists, suppressing undesirable debates and inquiries by removing them from the agenda. In December 2013, the GNC voted to follow sharia law, and decided that ""a special committee would review all existing laws to guarantee they comply with Islamic law.""

&gt;The GNC was believed by its opponents to be allowing Islamist groups to conduct assassinations, especially in Benghazi, and kidnappings. Prominent Islamist incidents in 2013-14 included the kidnapping of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan in October 2013, and the kidnapping of Egyptian diplomats in January 2014. Both incidents were carried out by the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room.

&gt;He has also issued fatwas restricting women's rights.

&gt;Later in 2013, lawyer Hamida Al-Hadi Al-Asfar was abducted, tortured and killed. It is alleged she was targeted for criticising the Grand Mufti's declaration

&gt;The GNC failed to stand down at the end of its electoral mandate in January 2014, unilaterally voting on 23 December 2013 to extend its power for at least one year. This caused widespread unease and some protests.

Additionally, his decision making is suspect when he does break the trap and gets his eyes on the keeper. He will hardly ever look for a pass, even when he is in a terrible position to shoot- whilst he has a very good ability to score, this is frustrating when we are a team which moves so coherently forward, that there is almost always a ball available.

false,monkeyspanner,null,null,"I think people are being mis-sold the idea of fairness and are buying it up because it's cheap and goes down easy. 

We (or we used to) have a pretty strong post war culture of not scrounging or wasting. Partially driven by need but also partially from the spirit of camaraderie that was ingrained in the war generations. Because of that you wouldn't have a situation where the health minister would take his kids to A&amp;E because he couldn't be bothered to wait for a GP. That would be an unfair waste of resources and inconsiderate to the system. 

Nowadays we've shifted to a more american mindset where people are more likely to think:
a) My life has been fair, so has everyone else's. Anyone who is struggling is struggling from their own doing. 
or
b) My life hasn't been fair, so I'm entitled to take whatever I can/want and everyone else can look after themselves. 

We can combine this with the hangover macro social pressures against abusing the state for welfare/healthcare etc and you get the UKIP/Tory message:

""Other people are living well from doing nothing, and it's unfair to you because you're a hard worker""

It's interesting because of how it marries personal selfishness and condemnation of selfishness. 

In any case, I'm not sure I agree that fairness itself has many negative manifestations, rather it's easy to make people think ""fairness"" should lead to scapegoating of others. ",0,1417271830,null,0,false,0,cmg49x3,t3_2nr4ff,t1_cmg49x3,t1_cmg3dyg,null,1425770724,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

It's not intentional but if you hang out with the same people every week then they naturally become your friend group, and it is easier to spend time with people who do the same kind of things you do. I do try and get out of the bubble where I can but at uni it's hard when you don't want to get drunk and go clubbing, or talk in detail about your (non-existent anyway) sexual conquests.

I expect there are plenty of people in my life who have no idea I'm a Christian: I'll never hide it, if you ask me what I did at the weekend I might say I went to a church thing but I don't tend to bring it up with anyone otherwise. I wouldn't say anyone has ever asked me to explain/defend my beliefs because it's just not a big deal and they aren't that bothered what I think. I do think that people don't realise sometimes that just because I'm white and middle class like them, doesn't mean I have the same social values.

Also, most of the 'young' churches that I have been to don't meet in a building people would immediately recognise as a church, so they might miss that it is even there if they aren't looking out for it. To be honest the whole relaxed atmosphere and band music of modern churches is absolutely nothing like what people think of when they think of Christian churches.

ETA: I see you became a Christian at uni as well! The only thing I get annoyed about about coming to faith later is that so, so many of my friends are already married and settled down. I'm happy for them but there isn't exactly a great big pool of men left for me to consider! I'm 23 and honestly sometimes feel like an old spinster. There is a lot of unconscious pressure within the church to find someone, especially when you are seeing people five years younger than you tie the knot!

Cultural differences...ok so I am half Canadian, my dad is a Canuck. He mentioned he always felt like an outsider, even after 20 years in NI, he was always considered foreign. Wasn't treated badly or anything but he always felt like he was on the fringes. 

In canada, people don't give a crap where you're from since there are so many foreigners here! 

You will probably be surprised to see post offices and banks with glass in front of the teller. In canada what shocked us is the teller has no protection, you can just lean over if you want lol. Weird. 

Police stations in NI are heavily guarded whereas in canada, you just stroll on in if you want. That was also bizarre. 

I can't speak for carrick but often in Belfast I found a lot of younger kids were rude, shouting obscenities etc. I've never seen that in canada.

My point is that streaming is clearly the way of the future, is on demand, and doesn't need a tv license. Linear broadcast is in its way out. You can stream Virgin media without a receiver:

I can't remember the last time the BBC made a series that told an engaging story in the way that HBO did with Rome etc.

It almost feels like the BBC think that to appeal to the more intellectual they just need to make current affairs and documentary programmes, and the rest can be mindless entertainment, where is the entertainment for those who want more than Eastenders, who want a stronger more coherent plot than Doctor Who, a series that if you don't watch from episode one you won't know what is happening because it has complexity and assumes you watched from start giving it the freedom to explore a proper storyline and character development. 

Channel 4 and 5 are not examples of what I want either, I find it bizarre that sky and virgin media offer hundreds of channels for less than £1 each rather than allowing channels to charge more to make better content and selling them piecemeal so people can get the money to the content creators they want to see content from.

Personally I think the whole TV funding model is broken at the moment from the state funded to the cable company controlled. Content providers are stuck with these middlemen that interfere with the interests on both sides, hopefully now HD video is easy on the internet it will upset the status quo, not just with netflix showing mostly older TV content but with companies making content specifically for internet distribution because I can't see any other way to get the kind of in depth entertaining content I want to see.

Dictate the debate?  UKIPs vice-chair has said Cameron has 'completely lost it'.  That there wouldn't be need for ridiculous exercises in wastes of time as this if we only had a fairer immigration policy and reasonable controls.

https://twitter.com/SuzanneEvans1/status/538474540910018560

&gt;the vast majority quite like people from the EU and have few if any problems.

If that were the case they'd have had a referendum in this term and taken UKIP's legs from under them.

As it turns out a large majority see uncontrolled immigration as a problem, and those happy with the EU are in a *minority*.  Immigration regularly tops the polls with the economy as the most pressing issue of the day.

If what you say was true they'd have held a referendum yesterday.  They know it is not the case, and they've already thrown all their misinformation at this and it's already losing traction.

 In a referendum UKIP will share the out platform with people like Conservatives David Davis, Daniel Hannan, Zac Goldsmith, or Labour's Kate Hoey.  Unions want to leave too.   When asked if people want a relationship based on trade they have a majority and only 14% support otherwise inevitable further political union.  

When people realise that we can have a relationship with Europe based on trade not political union, and when that message starts coming from more quarters, they're going to swamp the debate.  


&gt;Has anyone actually spoken to an Eastern European about this recently?  Some are starting to feel really unwelcome in a country that many were going as far as to call their own. 

Yes, but the easiest remedy to that is to introduce a controlled immigration policy so everybody knows that all immigrants have come to the country with a needed skillset and is contributing.  It would take all the heat out of the argument.  Apply the same point system to all countries equally so as to show favouritism over some, as we have now.

&gt;Some actually think there is a chance they might be sent packing.

Then they're misinformed.

Our best talents have been given a few years to grow at the club then, and maybe some of the pressure is off Pellegrini's back.

&gt;Sexism is everywhere, but it wasn't in this discussion to begin with

I don't think you understand how sexism works. Hint: it's not by pretending it's not there and not talking about it that it goes away. The people ignoring sexism are not the ones working against it. The world was not a gender equal utopia before women started obnoxiously whining about sexism.

&gt;Here's my anecdote, ready?

So we're back to anechdotes on the internet trump actual data now? Ok.

&gt;if you had led with a good link no one would be arguing with you or downvoting you

I... honestly don't care about downvotes. I also didn't expect to not be downvoted on this topic anywhere but in r/feminism. But again, the onus is not on me to prove that there is no link, but on those who suggested it.

&gt;You're forcing every aspect of this into your own war of the sexes framework when perhaps it doesn't fit so neatly. You've got a hammer, everything looks like nails,

Perhaps if you calmed down a bit, you could realise that somebody suggesting that there's something a tad bit sexist about suggesting that it's so unfortunate that modern women work. And saying that men could also stay at home just give plausible deniability here, because we both know that in this world as soon as a couple decides that one of them should stay at home, in 99% of cases the woman is going to be that one. And, more importantly, even that doesn't really matter because family paradigms that require one partner to be finantially dependent on the other are more often than not a bad idea. 

But ok, in this discussion about how obesity is caused by working mothers, it was me who was dreaming up the sexism sure. Blaming the messanger is always a good tactic, lets go with that.

false,NarwhalAMA,null,null,"&gt; What do you mean biased viewpoints? **This is factual information.**

Right here is your problem. I imagine the BBC did report on the stories you mention, but didn't give them much coverage. You may have listed some facts but that doesn't mean the BBC has to give them the level of coverage you desire. Media bias (or lack thereof) generally concerns prominence given to stories, and not whether they were reported on at all. The BBC could have focused it's Libya coverage on a really dodgy rebel group, Gaddafi as a family man, or the distraught family of an innocent baby killed by NATO air strikes. These would all be value judgements on factual events.

Russia Today may report on a neo-Nazi group protesting in Ukraine. Are they reporting on something factual? Probably, yes. But that doesn't mean they're covering Ukraine fairly when the focus of their entire TV channel is a tiny group of extremists and not the vast majority of protesters who are ordinary people. When the Daily Mail or Express print their front-page stories about someone claiming benefits for their 5000 children and buying 60-inch TV's these stories may be factual - the bias is because they're on the front page when really they're a non-issue.

There are thousands of current events happening all the time significant enough for news organisations to cover. This means that the BBC has to make calls 24/7 about which stories to focus on, from what angle, and how much coverage to give to each news item. As a publicly funded broadcaster and a corporation with an international reach, this means it's *always always always* going to receive accusations of bias.

I don't think the BBC is perfect. I *somewhat* agree with you about Libya; I think the Western media in general has gone quiet about Libya since the revolution and there hasn't been enough coverage of the ensuing crises. I also believe the BBC has something of a pro-Israel bias and it gives the Royals a ridiculous amount of coverage. 

Those are just my opinions though. On the whole I think the BBC does a solid job of reporting the news in a fair and accurate way. *(Most people in Britain support the Royal family - maybe they enjoy seeing detailed coverage of Prince Harry taking a shit?)*",0,1417276404,null,0,false,0,cmg5q8t,t3_2nqwil,t1_cmg5q8t,t1_cmg46yc,null,1425769974,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

false,Kalivha,null,null,"My boyfriend grew up biligually (but his education up to and including sixth form was in Welsh). He does *not* sound Welsh to me at all. He just sounds Southern most of the time. Anyway, generally you will probably find some correlation like people who speak Welsh as their *primary* language (which is a fair metric here) sounding more Welsh in English (and in Welsh, or at least I think so), and people who speak English as their primary language will sound less Welsh, but that's at least partly because English is more common in areas where the accent isn't that strong!

I think if anyone discriminated against Welsh speakers that'd not go over well because a lot of people feel very strongly about preservation of the language (which is an issue to some degree). I read something on Cymru Fyw (BBC thing) where there as a bit of outrage at people in the UK not being allowed to speak an arbitrary other language (I believe it was Polish) in some setting [Edit: I might have misinterpreted the tone as I don't actually understand Welsh very well - [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymrufyw/29968906)'s the link]. Like, it just wouldn't go over well because there's so much going on in favour of keeping the language alive!

Now for the stuff I am more familiar with, since you brought up Scotland. There are *very* few people who actually speak *Celtic* regional languages (i.e. Gaelic) fluently at all. There are more who speak some variant of Scots, but that's approximately a dialect of English. I lived in the south of Scotland and it's a lot more common in the north, but the number of native Gaelic speakers in Scotland is a lot lower than the number of native Welsh speakers in Wales, and I'd at least partly ascribe this to the fact that there is a lot less effort in preserving the language, comparatively.

What there *is* discrimination about is regional dialects (and sociolects) within English. I've been in situations where the Scottish bit of my accent made me feel distinctly uncomfortable (in the South) and at the same time know people who speak something that's very close to Scots who are really self-conscious about it even in Scotland.

We accused Rodgers for not changing enough and trying to make differences last week when we lost our third game in a row, today he has changed the centre back combination and finally played Toure deservedly, and left out Gerrard deservedly. The only thing we need changing right now is Enrique's fitness and a striker great with his feet, quick feet, and powerful runner, something we will get when Sturridge comes back, when Ibe comes back, and when Origi comes back. Rodgers is playing the long game still but I don't like how this season is a write off and next season is looking infinitely more promising already and it's barely December yet. I still think Rodgers needs to leave out Gerrard more often for us to see a sharper attack again, Lucas looks absolutely beautiful right now, hope he can stay fit.

People are welcome to have their opinions about whether the pitch was to blame or not, but once Mignolet set himself for a ball that was bouncing lower than it did, he's only got a split second to react to it rearing up.

false,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; Strictly speaking the Commons votes on a simple majority basis, so there is no minimum threshold (well other than, say, 6*) for a vote.

To be really pedantic, according to [these standing orders](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmstords/900/body.htm#41) of the House, a quorum of 40 including the Speaker and tellers is needed for a normal division, and in some cases [a majority of 100 is needed](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmstords/900/body.htm#37).

For example, in [yesterday's debates](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmvote/141128v01.htm) there was a procedural motion (item 3) at the start of the day but despite it being boring they still needed over 40 MPs to vote (Jacob Rees-Mogg being the only ""No""), and later in the day a closure motion failed (during item 6) despite being 60/0 as they needed a majority of 100.

However I think this only applies to actual divisions, not votes taken on volume of replies.

&gt; YES, this means that MPs often (more often than not, in fact) vote without having been in the chamber to hear the debate on the issue.

To add to this as well, the Parliament buildings are full of monitors showing what is going on in both chambers, so some of those MPs who haven't been in the chamber may still have been watching the debate, just from the comfort of their own office, or the bar, or similar.",0,1417278702,null,0,false,0,cmg6m02,t3_2np39a,t1_cmg6m02,t1_cmfoo0z,null,1425769563,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm a bit strange in admitting I don't find any traditional British comedy funny, so my opinion is kind of moot. 

Shows like Blackadder, Only Fools and the Armstrong and Miller show just aren't funny in my opinion. 
But then on the other hand I agree with you on the absolute horror that is

&gt;(""Alright pet I found it on t'internet"" - AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH)

Don't even get me started on Not Going Out. Jesus Christ. 

I do like The Office funny though, the recent series Detectorists was as great. Stewart Lee's comedy vehicle is still fairly good and Lead Balloon, from my memory at least, was brilliant. So it's not as if I'm anti-British comedy. 



Sitcoms and sketch shows are starting to look dated in my opinion and I'm not entirely sure that they're bringing in new viewers. It's not the format that's the issue, more that the format has the same gags recycled time and time again.
It's all well and good doing remakes of old sketch shows but they no longer seem to appeal to such a wide audience as they did historically.

Having said that though, a lot of the BBC's favourite panel shows are starting to look tired unfortunately. QI really isn't what it once was (though still not bad.), nor is Have I Got News For You (though that seems to range from great to crap on an almost weekly basis) for example. Never Mind the Buzzcocks isn't doing much better and Mock the Week is almost unwatchable in my opinion. 

But it's important to remember it's only the greats that stick out. I was young when The Office was on, but I'm sure there was plenty of tat on television at the time. As it was tat, we've forgotten it and we tend to look at the past with rose-tinted glasses and imagine that there was nothing but brilliance on the television.

Some of the shows the BBC puts out are of the highest quality. You just can't find many tv shows like that elsewhere. I think one bonus of being publicly funded is that you have no masters. In the US tv shows and news programs can't be 100% independent because all their funding comes from ads or they are owned by huge corporations. If a sponsor/owner ends up in the news because of something negative you'll typically see a late night host make a quip about it and then joke about hoping they didn't anger the sponsor. Alternatively if you look at something like John Oliver on HBO which is a paid service everything is fair game there.

The important thing is new ideas, not money,"" Klopp once said. ""You always want to be the team that can beat the one with more money.""


This is something that the German had made a habit of. He set the trend for the likes of Simeone and Brendan Rodgers in managing feats that were supposed to be way beyond their finances. Dortmund's successive titles between 2010 and 2012 were among the greatest achievements in the modern European game, as they levelled Bayern and so many other sides.

I think you're missing the point.

When the Media (rightfully or wrongfully) seeks Islamic community leaders to condemn violence acts by radicals, it has nothing to do with race. It's about group (which, in this case would be a religion - Islam) condemning the acts of extremists who have attached themselves to their group. This has absolutely nothing to do with race. Equally if the IRA committed an act of terrorism, it wouldn't be inconceivable for the media to seek the Catholic Church leaders or Sinn Fein to condemn their actions.

false,I_see_your_value_now,null,null,"Every university I applied to accepted it as part of my offer. My first choice lowered my offer because of my EPQ.

People often say that 'EPQ wasn't brought up in my application' and so on. This isn't a good argument, the fact it wasn't brought up doesn't mean it wasn't taken into account. If it boils down to you vs another applicant, and you have a relevant EPQ with a good grade, it will be favorable. Of the 8 people I know who have gone to Oxbridge, 7 of them have EPQ.

Here's a number of top universities that either accept it or take it into account.

Oxford: It is good for the breadth of an application to study the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). The EPQ provides applicants with the opportunity to develop research and academic skills relevant for study at Oxford. Candidates are encouraged to draw upon relevant EPQ experience when writing their personal statement. However, candidates are advised to prioritise their A-level study, as we do not include the EPQ in our conditional offers, so the final grades in A-levels, or equivalent qualifications, are more important. The EPQ will however be a good indicator of your ability to conduct independent research and also undertake an extended piece of writing.

Bristol: “The University recognises that some A Level students may also choose to offer the Extended Project. In such cases some admissions tutors may make two alternative offers, one of which involves success in the Extended Project  (e.g. either AAA at A Level or AAB at A Level plus Extended Project).” 

Cambridge: “We welcome the introduction of the Extended Project and would encourage you to undertake one as it will help you develop independent study and research skills and ease the transition from school/college to higher education.” 

Newcastle: “We value the skills of research and independent learning that the Extended Project is designed to develop. We welcome applications from students offering the Extended Project alongside A levels. As the Extended Project is optional it is not a requirement for application. If you offer an Extended Project, it will be taken into account. Your offer may be varied as a result, in recognition of the level of study skills you will have developed.” 

UCL: “UCL welcomes the introduction of the Extended Project into the curriculum, recognising that it will develop many of the skills necessary for successful study at university. For students presenting A-levels, UCL will be accepting a pass in the Extended Project as an alternative to the need to offer a pass in a fourth subject at AS level.”

false,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"I did my test going on 2 months ago now and I genuinely think the whole thing is far, far too easy. I had an excellent instructor who genuinely taught me to drive, not just pass a test. He wasn't cheap, but I'd rather spend money on quality tuition and learning to drive well rather than spend the money on a new car after a crash because I didn't have the proper skill set to deal with the situation. 

But on the other hand, as I've already said a lot of people learn to pass a test, not learn to drive. So making the test harder won't = better drivers, unfortunately. 

I don't see the value in scrapping it, but I do see the value of adding the new things in:

&gt;more realistic everyday manoeuvres, such as reversing out of a parking bay, or re-joining the flow of traffic from the side of a road.

Why do we have to take away whenever we look to expand the test?

Turn in the road might not be the most used manoeuvre for most people, but knowing how to do it safely and efficiently is still a good skill to have. Funnily enough it's the manoeuvre I've used the most by far!

Shelvey was putting shots in but he was forcing half chances all game and losing the ball in the process, it was sloppy.  Crystal Palace were getting most of their chances on the counter, and the more silly mistakes we made, the more chances they had.  So I think Britton should have come on in the second half to slow the tempo, even Carroll would have worked.  Dyer's absence also hurt us today, I like Barrow but while he's quick, he's still young and made some mistakes in good areas of the pitch.  I just think Dyer would have made a better impact, especially with us needing a goal late in the game.  Ultimately a very disappointing game, we had a great opportunity for 3 points and we let it go.

false,Suttreee,lfc99,,"I agree with this, once Lucas came of we looked a lot more shaky in defense. Lucas does a lot of things that I think a lot of people don't notice, because they're not looking for it.

So many times, there's a pass to a striker that can't be passed, because Lucas is in the way. So often when someone rounds one of our fullbacks, they don't have a free cross because Lucas is there.

Honestly, a good DM is very much about just reducing enemy options. Often you won't need to make that heavy tackle, you won't need to chase down that speedy winger, you'll just have to cover the room between the player with the ball and the player he wants to play.

Lucas does that really well and it makes our whole defense a lot safer. This season, and last, we've looked very shaky because the room between our midfield and defense is big enough that enemies get to turn with the ball and play with theirs noses towards our goal. Lucas closes a big part of that room and that's why I believe we should let him get an extended run from now on.

If it's just a fluke, then we'll know, but I don't think it is. Lucas clearly the MotM for me, then comes Sterling. I don't think Toure played incredibly well; he did good, but no better than some others.

We had Britton and Carroll on the bench, both are more conservative players who would have contributed with less, but better chances.  Barrow also lost it a couple times when he was brought on, which is to be expected for a young player trying to make a late impact.

I live here and the reporting on BBC didn't portray the positive enthusiastic electric atmosphere buzzing through our country for two years. The increasingly informed electorate. The desire for positive change. The conversations happening in houses and schools and pubs and offices.

Actually, the whole referendum was barely mentioned until a month before the vote. It was also super simplified and made to be about the SNP and Alex Salmond - which was totally not the case. There were many voices on many sides of the debate not being heard. It was ""angry nationalists"" versus ""clever sensible folk"".

I'm not from Syria or Israel or the USA or continental Europe or anywhere else. A year ago I would've just assumed that the BBC's coverage was factual and had no spin. After seeing their blatantly biased coverage first hand I can't take anything else they say at face value. Have they simplified the issue? Does it have a subtle pro-UK bias? Are there other related issues going on that aren't being reported? Are they stigmatising a certain political figure? Are they misrepresenting a group? Are they not reporting the full story?

As long as you are not being physically oppressed, either respect the law of the land, or fuck the fuck right off.

If I was the worker, I would have checked my contract before signing it. I would like to think that I would be valued enough to have my opinions considered, but if they signed a contract stating otherwise, then they should refer to the above.

As for those asking if it is allowed or not, I really couldn't say. I would however, say that it is down to how religious the person is. There is nothing explicitly stating ""and yay, but the almighty lord preached to the good moses ""though shalt not handle pork in Asda."""" 

If, however, the person working there is being made to do something not in his job description that is against his religion, that is a breach of his human rights, and if sacked could cause a major, MAJOR problem for ASDA. Or even if he just walked, that is a very clear case of constructive dismissal.

But what I would really say, OP, is don't get yourself in a tiff. My guess is that they want to meet you for 15 minutes to find out what you are and are not happy to do, and respect that.

false,Tim_Stark,lfc68,,"Well, this certainly wasn't a game result I expected. To be honest, I was thinking we'd have something like a 1-2 loss with all the defensive mistakes we've been having. I think that playing Kolo Toure in the back four was the best decision Rodgers has made this season, as he was stellar. He got plenty of stick in the previous season for his poor play, but this has clearly improved this season and it's good to see him back in the first team. I don't think there was a single header he didn't claim as his own. Enrique appeared solid in his fullback position and provided an impressive amount of pace of the flank. Glen Johnson was average at best, but **wow that diving header**!  Meanwhile, Mignolet has had what looked like his most confident game in goal this season yet. His shot-stopping was on point, and we didn't concede any set pieces.

I blame the internet. Once an opinion takes hold, it quickly becomes orthodoxy. The taste-makers - MotD, MNF, TAW - say something and it becomes a talking point.

The awful blogs get posted on reddit and facebook and further reinforce the ideas.

The reason our defenders make so many mistakes is not because they're bad, it's because they are constantly having to make difficult split second decisions.  If you get Tiago Silva and have one fast but limited player running straight at him and another peeling away to his left, he's gonna make a mistake sometimes, whether it's positioning or technical. Those situations are incredibly difficult. With Gerrard in there, that fast limited 10 doesn't need to be good, he just needs to be there, because Gerrard is slow and not alert to the dangers. It's a role which requires a long time to learn, and Gerrard played his whole career further up the field (and even then positioning was not his forte).  
 
The worst game for me this season was West Ham away, where Downing of all people found so much space and caused such problems because he had Gerrard as the central player supposed to be marking him. Lucas actually played this game but bizarrely was essentially an 8, way too far up field to do anything about the issue. It's too easy to get around Gerrard, he's never marking the right player or space, and all too often the defenders have to make difficult decisions about whether to go to or stay back.

Not bad ta. I'm going to blast the remnants of this hangover out of the water with some pie and ale soon, then it's X-Factor and film time. Earlier today I watched [The Bourne Legacy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194173/?ref_=nv_sr_2), which was more than a bit shit; it exemplifies mediocrity, but turned down a notch or six lower than that. I mean, who the fuck ever thought it would be a good idea to make a Bourne film without Matt Damon? I know, I know!!! Let's take every unsurprising Hollywood action cliche we've ever seen and put them ALL TOGETHER IN ONE COMPLETE FILM!! Then let's sell it under the Bourne brand - but fuck it - Damon's too expensive these days, so let's just use someone *nobody has ever heard of before* with a buff chest. 

Not sure which film to watch later; I wanted my aunt to see Interstellar but you can't buy it to rent anywhere yet, same goes with the film about Turing :(
