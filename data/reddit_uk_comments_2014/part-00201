I haven't seen tonight's Police Interceptors but have seen one in the past where they just sent them on their way. I had a mate get stopped and he told the police he was working delivery, they told him if they caught him at it again without business insurance he'd be on for 6 points and a £200 fine.

If it became the law that any business offering delivery properly insured their drivers, you could stop this happening overnight. It's much easier to ask a business advertising delivery to produce proof their drivers are insured, than to spot someone driving down the road without the correct type of insurance. 

All these independent takeaways will have extra weekend staff on Friday, Saturday nights. 5 - 10 hours variable per week, minimum wage, lots of 18 - 21 year old lads working it, no way are the vast majority paying for business insurance. It baffles me that businesses aren't required to insure their staff.

I do also wonder why the police don't just park up near the shop, wait for someone to take a delivery out, pull them over and have a chat.

Your opinion on this is depressing. I'm glad to see you've got the city workers and commuters plights close to your heart but being inconsiderate is kind of the point of a protest, to be noticed, to be heard. You won't do shit if everyone gets on with their lives and never notice. If this does cause disruptions their annoyances will be forgotten about tomorrow.

Which has nothing to do with race. In the ancient world, slaves were normally criminals who lost their freedom, or captives taken in war (and often their descendants). There was no racial component to it. The concept was different then. 

And the Bible has conflicting verses on slavery, however it never celebrates it.

&gt;Right, it's not forbidden to be gay, it's just forbidden to do any of the things which gay people do which make them different than straight people.

One way of looking at it. Conversely, that means it's not OK to do it even if you are straight.

The problem I see is that by surreptitiously infiltrating the public's data, communications and habits, that is a behaviour that forces people to be exposed - possibly against their will. Declaring after the fact that any personal violations of privacy are for the nation's good, and one need not worry if one is not up to any shenanigans, is an act of harsh nationalism and aggression. Forcing someone to adhere to a political position is a subtle act of tyranny. That some paedos or terrorists may be caught is merely a tradeoff against the violations of privacy: it is a [consequentialist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) justification, where the infiltration is itself unjustifiable but the possible results, which are highly desirable, are dangled as 'prizes' to be won; the cost of 'entry' is an unelective decision made for you to have no privacy in communication - even if that communication is made between people who would rather that the content, or even the fact of talking itself (or, *ingrediatur ad doctrinam*, visited websites used to inform a decision about whether to further investigate an individual) be kept secret. Call me a radical, but I think the right of Englishmen to act without Government eavesdropping is a more pertinent form of English traits than breaking private communication and stealing others' information. Undoubtedly, Government - which nominally ***works under the people***, not **above** them - would say that one's website viewing history is not actively monitored - it would only come in handy for historical reasons or to detect bad actors. The problem there is violating others' privacy to determine innocence or guilt. The temptation to search for patterns *a priori* is, I fear, great, and deserves special scrutiny to ensure the rights of the free individual are maintained.

I reckon my criteria was a bit different than yours seems to be, however. For instance, while I did look for a club with a similar play style and local ties, that was pretty much it. You're basically looking for the American equivalent of Tottenham - rivalries, record, and all. If I had done that, I likely would not have used the Galaxy -- or any other MLS side -- for my comparison. I would have used the Lakers and likely ended up supporting Man U.

So if supporting a perennial underachiever is that important to you, then truth be told, your needs would probably be better met by a different club. My two cents, though, is this: don't focus on rivalries, don't focus on records, don't focus on popularity. All they'll do is limit your options.

Oh sure, I understand the desire to pick a team similar in all ways to the one(s) you currently support, but what's the fun in that? Odds are pretty good you'll never capture the same enthusiasm you feel for your main club with any other, so why even force yourself to try?

I get that I could never have as genuine a reaction to any result in a NLD as much as any native Londoner would. I understand Spurs have not had nearly the same success as my Lakers or Galaxy in domestic or European competition. But you know what? I don't care. They're no lesser than any of the other clubs I've adopted.

The great thing about the MLS is that because the league is so young, it doesn't really matter who you choose right now: every club has multiple possible futures. 

You think in 40-50 years, the most league titles won by any team will still stand at four?

You think Seattle and Portland will still have the most fans?

You think Donovan will still hold the all-time record for goals scored?

Absolutely not.

Soccer is finally starting to flourish in America, get in on a team early and grow your relationship organically.

Most officers will search under two main laws on the street, these are section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1986 and section 23 of the Misuse of drugs act (MOD) 1971.


When searching under section 1 of PACE they will be searching for the acronym SOAP.

These items are :


 Stolen goods
Articles for use in certain Theft Act offences.
Offensive weapons, including bladed or sharply-pointed articles (except folding pocket knives with a bladed cutting edge not exceeding 3 inches).
Articles made, adapted or intended for use in destroying or damaging property, added by Section 1 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 e.g.
paint sprays, etching tools and
tools used to cause graffiti.
“fireworks” within the definition of “fireworks” in section 1(1) of the Fireworks Act 2003, added by the Section 115 Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.  (
The Fireworks Regulations 2004 made it an offence to:
 possess adult fireworks (all fireworks except party poppers and sparklers, etc.) in a public place by anyone under the age of 18;
 possess category 4 fireworks (professional display fireworks) by anyone other than a fireworks professional.)

So basically stolen goods, articles to cause damage, prohibited articles and offensive weapons.


Officers searching under section 23 MOD are looking for controlled substances I.E drugs.


Officers must have reasonable grounds to search under either law and there are a variety of grounds which can, combined, constitute reasonable grounds.


Location
Description
Smell of drugs
Drugs paraphernalia
Behaviour
Body signs (red eyes, excitable behaviour etc)
 And so forth. This list obviously isn't exhaustive.



When being searches an officer is allowed to remove the acronym JOG.


This stands for Jacket, Outer clothing and Gloves. So an officer can ask you to take these things off. An officer can also search the car/vehicle you are in as well. 


In certain circumstances an officer may ask you to remove footwear and headwear, which includes religious articles such as the headscarf and Kippa.  This MUST be done out of public view and can be done in the back of a police car or even in a shop doorway if there are no other people present.


Officers can also strip search you at the police station if they have reasonable grounds to do so, but unless anyone wants further details, I'll leave that for now.


When an officer searches you, he must the acronym GOWISELY when informing you of the search. This stands for


Grounds - why the officer is searching you.
Offence - what offence you have allegedly or could have committed.
Warrant card - only if the officer is in plain clothes
Identification - their surname
Station - what station they are based at 
Entitlement - you are entitled to a copy of the stop slip, known in London/Met as a 5090 form now, or at a police station within 3 months I believe (I think it was once 12 months).
Legislation - what law they are using to stop and search you.
You are being detained for the purposes of a search.


These can be done in any order and must be done before the search starts unless certain circumstances apply.



Officers may also powers under section 3 of the criminal law act 1967 and section 117 of PACE to use force in a search. This can apply to holds, grabs, relocations and the most obvious one, handcuffing. Officers can only use force if it proportionate, legal and necessary. They must also be accountable for their actions.


You may film officers at any time during a search and it doesn't matter if it's in public or a private place. Obviously there may be some practical issues if they need you to move, or may put the camera down or pass it on to someone else if it becomes obstructive or detrimental to the search.


Always, always be polite, civil and accommodating within reason, and if you have any concerns or disagreements with anything, let the officer know.

Do not raise your voice, swear or become obnoxious as this will not help your cause or defence. Do not answer any questions relating to the offence if possible, but use common sense. If any officer asks you why you are in the area and you have a perfectly good reason, let them know and you could possibly avoid arrest.


Officers may also search people after arrest under section 32 and premises under section 18(1) and 18(5) of PACE but this is a different scenario to what OP was posting.

Officers may seize anything that could be evidence of an offence under section 19 of PACE. They can use reasonable force to do so, such as breaking doors, compartments of cars etc.

This an include your mobile phone if they believe you have evidence of an offence, but this will mainly apply to certain public order offences. They can seize items up for a prolonged period of time, so be wary of certain incidents you film.


If you have any complaints to make, you have a variety of ways of doing so.

Talking to the duty office/inspector at the police station for local mediation.

Talk to the IPCC about major complaints

Talk to a solicitor.

http://thelawdictionary.org/mitigation/

&gt;Alleviation; abatement or diminution of a penalty or punishment im- posed by law. “Mitigating circumstances” are such as do not constitute a justification or excuse of the offense in question, but which, in fairness and mercy, may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral culpability

There were 2 sets of Mitigating circumstances. You can be sent to prison purely for assault - this was mitigated because ""they were not used to drinking"". They escaped near certain jail for kicking the girls head because the boyfriend had used ""excessive force"" to try and stop them ( that excessive force that didn't seem to deter them - you can see in the vid ).

true,bluntstick,newcr-1,straya,"Basically, we need a permanent striker: problem is, we're not a money club. We're not Chelsea or Manchester City, or even Liverpool: we can't just drop 40 million squid when we see a player we like, like they can. 

That being said, Lukaku would be an amazing choice, but Chelsea want some where in the region of 20-25 million pounds for him. Now we could *maybe* afford that. The problem is, this season, we have Europa League (it's kind of a big deal, but not as big a deal as the Champions League) as well as the the Premier League. That means we don't just need a striker, we need about five or six other players as well, because the  Europa League means the lads will be playing twice a week. That's obviously super exhausting, so we need these five or six new (good) players to be substitutes. 

Our transfer budget has been quoted as somewhere in the region of 40 million, maybe A LOT less than that, but let's say for arguments sake it is that much: if Lukaku costs 25 million, that's more than half the budget gone on one player, when we need more like five or six decent players. 

Now, Lukaku's young, fast, and can find the back of the net, but he's not a complete striker yet. IF (that's a big if, as far as I'm concerned) we bought him, he'd be an investment. He's 21 and in four or five years time he could potentially be worth double that. BUT, we want to perform now. We want to make the Champions League this coming season (not just for the money it gives you either: it's also about exposure for the club, and more importantly, the prestige of knowing we, a small club that, as I've already mentioned, aren't a money club, can compete with the big clubs with Russian oil money (I'm looking at you, Chelsea)). 

So this turned into a wall of text, sorry mate. But that's the run down: yes we definitely need a striker, but good strikers don't come cheap unless they're on loan and that, in my opinion, is a short term solution to a long term problem. At the moment, all we can really do is trust that Martinez knows what he's doing, and even though he's only been in charge for a season or so, most of us are fairly confident he does.

It's not evidence on Neave's involvement with the intelligence services at all. 

At best, that passage is weak evidence that the INLA killed Neave. There's probably some outlandish conspiracy theory that thinks they had absolutely nothing to do with the murder, and this passage might be used against that, I suppose. Even so, you have an unnamed source, with vague 'involvement' in the crime and the only direct quote is just speculation on a hypothetical, making the whole thing weaksauce.

Compare and contrast two independent, named intelligence officers going on the record with hard factual claims (one of them took written notes which Paul Foot had forensically examined) detailing what Neave said to them.

Haha. I was teasing you about your reflexive demand for 'neutral sources' when you'd just linked to the newspaper in Britain with currently the worst reputation for partisan and biased reporting.

if you arent staying in the city island itself, buy bus tickets at the airport - the drivers on the bus frequently run out and you then have to wait 30 mins for another bus! You have to wave them on a machine when you get on the bus for it validate them. 


The water taxis are well expensive, don't use them - you can walk everywhere in venice in like 30 mins max. Hower, you WILL get lost - even with a smartphone and gps, there's a lot of stone walls to block the signal.  The water bus is worth doing at least once (especially at night for the views from it all along the grand canal), but its fairly expensive, about a 7 euro single fare i think. There are public gondola services to get you around that are a very cheap way to travel (the privates ones though are €80-100 a go, so...) (€2 a time for a short 5 min river crossing). 


[this](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d1547688-Reviews-Antico_Forno-Venice_Veneto.html) place does the best pizza i've ever had, and [this](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d3356272-Reviews-Alfredino_s_Fresh_Pasta_To_Go-Venice_Veneto.html) place is the same for pasta. Both are small and get quite busy, but are worth it.

We also did a free walking tour (see tripadvisor) - you have to book in advance and there's a tip for the tour guide etc etc, but its a pretty good way to spend a few hours getting an introduction to the main attractions in venice.

The absolute cheapest way to see Venice from the water is to take the vaporetto.  There is a route that travels the length of the Grand Canal but I can't remember the number.

Do not eat anywhere that shows pictures of the food on the menu.

Your main mode of transport will be walking.  Allow time for getting lost - it is part of the experience.  You can't get too far off track, there isn't enough space. 

If you have the time, try to explore areas other than the traditional highlights.  There are various guides on sale that suggest routes - I found Paulo Giordani's ""Venice: Thirty walks to explore the city"" to be pretty good and you should be able to find the English translation easily enough.

Likewise, explore the other islands if you can (particularly Murano, Burano and Torcello).

If you are a fan of the Indiana Jones films, the church you are looking for is in Campo San Barnaba, in Dorsoduro.

Don't leave a restaurant without a written bill - the guardia di finanzia do actually take this seriously.

Do make an attempt to speak Italian - even if you are bad at it everyone can have a laugh about it and you will generally get better service than people who stick to English.

If you are visiting churches and cathedrals, Venice isn't as strict on dress codes as some other parts of Italy but it is still advisable to dress reasonably modestly (avoid shorts and short skirts if possible, keep shoulders covered and take your hat off if you are male).

If you visit Piazza San Marco as a couple, you will be deluged with flower sellers.  Don't speak to them, don't even look at them.   Once they have your attention they'll be locked onto you like a tick.",0,1405383337,null,0,1405383664,0,cixjya5,t3_2apnbl,t1_cixjya5,t3_2apnbl,null,1434717445,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

The necessity lies in the fact that the UK is too small and too unimportant to rule the planet on its own, while the EU has the largest economy on this planet, could with relative ease have the second largest (or, I dare say largest) military in the world if it pleased, and most certainly has the gravitas to be a superpower.

 ""Fullfact.org"" gives a contadictory statement 

&gt;We contacted the Judicial Office to find out more details about the case and they told us the judgement was given orally and therefore there was no written manuscript available. They did however point us towards an article written in the Leicester Mercury. They also asserted that the reference to alcohol had been made in mitigation of the accused and that the role of the victim’s boyfriend was one which impacted on the judgement.


A) There was no written manuscript available ( suspicious in itself ) 

YET

B) They knew exactly what the judge had said

God Bless their eidetic memory.  Couldn't possibly be that the Leicester Court House wanted to save one of their top judges the embarrassment of an unpopular decision. 

I would also be very surprised if

&gt;According to the Mercury, the Judge Robert Brown said, “This was ugly and reflects very badly on all four of you. Those who knock someone to the floor and kick them in the head can expect to go inside, but I’m going to suspend the sentence”.

..was all of  Judge Robert Brown summing up but believe what you want. 

If you read that article you will also see that there are 2 other papers with the same attention grabbing headline. Is your assertion that it is only racist when the Daily Mail makes a sensationalist headline or are the Metro and the Telegraph also racist?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;the individuals working at GCHQ have little control over, they follow the direction set by the countries leadership and perform their jobs to the best of their ability.

Thanks for reiterating my point that the functionaries are doing the bidding of their masters. Choosing to do that job doesn't exculpate anyone of *doing what they do*, but I accept your point that most people aren't in a position to affect change. However, the only way to not do anything untoward is to not do anything untoward, and that would include jobs that require such functions. There are plenty of alternatives available, so my rash conclusion was that a conscious decision had been made to put oneself in such a position and therefore consenting to every directive. The Office is an employer, and working for the *company* does imply an affiliation of agreement of ideology. In this case, the corporation is the State, albeit one with overwhelming force. Many workers are naïve or idealistic; many are deferent; many are complicit; some are Directors. Unless under duress, one can only be [responsible for one's own actions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_responsibility#Philosophical_stance) - so long as one is free to choose to do something or not. 

The tools employed by GCHQ to influence people are a form of lying, and it is us who are forcibly taxed to pay for such activity. Again, we are told to ""trust Government"", with no transparency. Openness and honesty ingratiates one more easily than force and coercion. Perhaps every instance of the tools' use [is worthy](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4346128) but we don't know.

One could argue that cracking systems serves the overall integrity of communication, but that would only hold true if 'holes' are filled by helpfully telling systems designers of the existence of weaknesses and not exploiting them to snoop on people. That makes everyone vulnerable, as those same weaknesses can be exploited by other bad actors. A national firewall could conceivably be proposed to mitigate that risk, one thinks, but that wouldn't increase subjects' protections from Government or evil people at home. At this point, though, one really should consider how the decisions taken by Government are affecting people and whether one's actions are harmful.

We aren't talking about war crimes or such, where severe injury to another is obvious and patently wrong, but rather issues of public and private life and morality - and possibly manipulation, interference, [calumny](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2690141/MI5-spies-blamed-spreading-lurid-sex-scandal-rumours-Leon-Brittan.html) or [harm](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28123438).

The [golden rule](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) should be a starting point. I accept that there is always a toing and froing at the frontier of any discussion, but there must always be awareness of the wider picture of how one would like to live.

I see Bony as the strong, center forward type of guy that finishes chances and yet Sturridge fills that role, with more pace and success in the league.

Eccleston's run on the show got an average of 8.1 for his first season, Tennant's first season got an 8.0 and Smith's an 8.2.

The first series has 3 bad episodes with all 3 Slitheen episodes ranking in the bottom 15. So I will concede that to you, Eccleston's run was definitely not worse than any other season.

Different people see the balance from different perspectives  - It's ""you must do the most to encourage victims of abuse to come forward"" vs. ""There is no need to create victims of false accusation"". 

I think most people think victims of abuse really don't need a disincentive to come forward and any law against false accusations is a disincentive. Also I think people see the accused are in a better place mentally to recover from a false accusation. I certainly don't see any feminists giving a shit about the accused.


&gt;Comins argues that **men who are unjustly accused can sometimes gain from the experience**. 'They have a lot of pain, but it is not a pain that I would necessarily have spared them.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_schools_and_branches

If you only read the quran and hadith you simply wont have the foggiest about how these came to be, what the differences are. 

Outside of these branches there are quranists, non-denominationalists and cultural muslims. You have purists, you have progressives. You have reformists, you have traditionalists.

There are also sects such as ahmaddiyyah, nation of islam and so forth which are considered heretical by many other muslim sects. 

There are the salafis and their violent politically motivated offspring salafi-jihadists. Not the same, ideologically different from each other.

On top of all these movements you have the fact that islam has crossed vast geographical boundaries and cultures and is obviously affected by the social attitudes and legal boundaries of each place. It is not uncommon to see  a bosnian or albanian muslim drink a beer, but religious saudi salafi muslims would most likely refuse one if offered for example.As for muslims themselves there are clearly different levels of adherence. 

Islam has lots of room for interpretation, pretty much the only commonality all these various sects share are adherence to the five pillars of islam.

On top of this you have political movements. Islamism which came from the islamic revivalist movement around the turn of the twentieth century is influenced by western philosophers, hegel and marx/lenin and aims to create an islamic state ruled by sharia as opposed to man made law. From that idea came qutbism, which declares muslims that aren't islamists ""census muslims"" apostates and suggests therefore that its okay to kill them by declaring them kuffar, a process known as takfir, this of course has led to mass bloodshed in muslim countries. However not all islamists are takfiris, other islamist movements propose create an islamic state by building social justice movements for example, others still propose military coups and peaceful take overs of islamic countries along with a socialist-style redistribution of wealth.

You couldnt hope to understand islam as it exists in the world today by simply reading the koran, because your interpretation may not relate to the interpretation of other muslims who may well be influenced by other factors anyway and who may adhere to specific legal schools or sects.

Like I said, islam is an incredibly complex subject. It's far bigger than just the religous texts as are most if not all religions.

That's really fantastic, but hasn't at all answered my question. Not at all. But losing probably the best striker in the world is going to hold Liverpool back. Rodgers has work to do, you can't play that same football. Liverpool looked unbeatable last season, the level you were playing at was incredible... Then Mourinho worked it out. He did some homework and shredded your plans, and basically showed the world how to counter the relentless attacking football. Last season was your chance and it got taken away from you. Yes, Arsenal took some major losses with serious goal differences.... But you lost key games. Against Chelsea. And to the three goals against Palace? They are not performances of champions. You did not deserve that trophy. If you couldn't win these key games with Suarez in your team last year, how exactly will do you it this time round? By all means you can give it a good go, but don't get your hopes up. You don't have the quality that Chelsea or City will have. You've bought some very mediocre players, but no real proven talent will want to join Liverpool because your star has left you and moved to play with Barcelona. You have nothing to offer. I do wish the club all the best in all competitions, and yes it would've been great to see an underdog win that trophy last year... But logic caught up, and that's just how it is. Some Liverpool fans sounded a little too smug and entitled for my liking, anyway. So it was great to see a London club humble a club that may have been a little out of its depth.

Also, when Suarez left, we finished 2nd in the league as well and are no longer in danger financially.  

&gt;The other reason is they all left for the one, two or maybe three other top teams in the world. 

This is exactly my point. When Markovic matures and turns out to be a world beater; Madrid, Barca, Bayern etc. are still going to be bigger than us. 

Oh well, there's no point arguing. We'll just have to wait and see. 

Edit: also, people underestimate how much bringing in a big name or keeping a big name influences other signing. If we were in for Reus for example, I'm 100% sure he'd be more convinced to join if we still had Suarez, rather than no Suarez and a couple of unproven prospects.

We demolished teams that sat back, and we demolished teams that came at us, we also demolished teams too stupid enough to play without a defensive midfielder. Yeah Suarez will be a big loss, but answer me this, in 2012 you sold robin van Persie. Now that arsenal side with RVP was the most one-man team I've ever seen. Yet the following season you replaced RVP with Giroud and managed to scrape 4th. Now we finished above you last season for a reason, we were better than you, we might not finish above you next season but we sure as hell won't collapse, we still have a line up worthy of challenging for the league title and a line up good enough to finish 4th. You said we've bought very mediocre players.... I can guarantee no one was saying lallana is a mediocre player last season, but now that he's joined Liverpool, yeah he's mediocre. I'm not sure if you understand the concept of squad depth either....Can, lambert, Markovic all bought for squad depth, we had 15 fit players last season, three of those were cissokho, Moses and aspas. There's still 8 weeks of the window left, we'll continue to make more singings, hopefully a maquee player too. I can't believe you have the fucking balls to talk about collapses when your title challenge collapsed in February. We drew with palace because Brendan made a mistake and kept attacking to try and improve our GD, in the end it cost us. But it's certainly better to go out of the title race like that than to lose 5-1 and 6-0 to your title rivals. How embarrassing to lose 6-0 to Jose Mourinho on Wenger's 1000th game.

true,DemonsInTheDesign,null,null,"I'd recommend something that me and the family do whenever we've been to Venice before. Catch the Vaporetto (water bus) Line 1 anywhere along the Grand Canal, heading to Lido. Try to catch an older looking Vaporetto, the one's with the seats around the front. When you first get on, you'll probably have to stand a-midships (in the middle), by the entrance until you get to Lido, but when you get to Lido, EVERYONE gets off. This is your chance, grab those seats at the front! Now you have front row seats up the entire Grand Canal on the return trip up to Piazzale Roma! It's probabaly worth mentioning that all Vaporetto (as I remember) have an open area at the back, even the new ones, but, hey, travelling up front is more fun. You can do this in reverse of course (get on Line 1 heading toward Piazzale Roma and hope everyone gets off their for the turn around as they do at Lido) though I've never tried it.

Along with this recommendation, I'd recommend buying an all day ticket from an Actv ticket office if you're planning on travelling long distances, although I'm not sure about the prices, but they'll be easily found online. The stops are very frequent and the network is pretty far reaching, out to the islands of Burano, Murano etc outside of the historic city. I would definitely recommend a visit out to these outlying islands at some point in your stay (if you have longer than a couple days or so) for the amazing glass making and associated art, the charming colourful houses and the fantastic seafood out there.

Visit some churches, even if you're not remotely religious. Seriously, the artwork in those churches is STUNNING. HUGE murals and paintings that cover entire rooms and ceilings. As well as this, you can go up the top of the Campaniles (church towers) on quite a few of the churches (for a couple of euros or more). Here you'll see breathtaking views of Venice from above.

Eating out in Venice gets expensive pretty quick, but there is honestly no better place to eat in my opinion than right by the canal on a warm night. It's just breathtaking. 

I suppose I'm getting into nerdy territory here, but I love marvelling at all the multitude of different types of boats and associating with them the wheeled transport you'd find in every other city. You'll see a cabin cruiser, that'll be someone saloon car. You'll see boats with massive outboard engines attached, that'll be someone's sports car. You'll see little cargo boats adorning the names of haulage firms like DHL, they're the trucks, you'll see ambulances, fire engines, police cars, even hearses, all in boat form. I find that fascinating! 

Whatever you choose to do with your time, Venice is an absolutely remarkable city, the most beautiful city in the world, it's true. I hope you have an amazing time there whatever you get up to!

I then took the number of times each word identified was used per subreddit and divided them by the subreddit populations (which I gathered by going to the subreddits in question and adding their populations to the formula.) The bar was then colorized proportionally based on which words contributed to the total amount of swearing used.

My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to trust in my graphing program.

If you want to see what the top 1,000 or so words were, per subreddit, I have created word clouds for each subreddit. I also made lists for every [MLB](http://imgur.com/gallery/4k2hx), [EPL](http://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/26ug28/rpremierleague_and_every_team_subreddits_most/), [NHL](http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/2718tj/rhockey_and_all_team_subreddits_most_used_words/), [NBA](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/27c143/rnba_and_nba_team_subreddits_most_used_words_for/), and [NFL](http://imgur.com/a/oIqbn) team subreddit for their last respective seasons. I will be repeating my efforts with this list to get an idea of the most (and least) foul-mouthed sports fans.

Obviously I can only speak about my own personal experience but I never found British people to hate me for being American (in fact I don't think any of them hated me at all, hopefully!). 

Having said that, it depends a lot on your attitudes. Brits love to make fun of everything, especially their own country, and so have no problem taking the piss out of America relentlessly. A lot of them also have a very real and very justifiable dislike of the American government. However, anybody who would hold you accountable for the wrongs of the US government probably isn't someone you want to be friends with anyway, and I've yet to meet anybody who actually hates me personally like that. 

The line I hear quite a bit is ""I don't mind Americans, I just don't like America."" So basically you're gonna have to be comfortable with them hating America and not go all patriotic and start talking about 1776 or how ""if it wasn't for us you'd all be speaking German!"". They'll write you off without a second thought. 

Other than that the British are really friendly when you get to know them; as cliche as it sounds just be yourself and try to relate to them person-to-person rather than American-to-Brit and you'll be just fine.

**tl;dr:** No you won't be 'hated on' just for being American, just expect a little friendly banter because of your Americanness

At that time the base rate was 5% and my contract said I would have to pay 2% above it. Now the base rate plummeted to 0.5% so I'm only paying 2.5% mortgage. That was luck, so I didn't bother getting a new product.


I went on interest only. I still have 289k to pay back I think. I have not paid one penny back to the mortgage but I make 20k profit a year from the flat and I use this money to fund my other businesses. My flat value has gone up in price as it's city Center and if I'm ever screwed I can just sell the flat and come out with a profit. I'm not dead set on paying off the mortgage. I might do so when I'm 40 or something!

I think he led the line well in all his games and seemed to be free from his normal double wrong footed-ness he often has for city. 

Zab, a personal favorite of mine, and MDM both did play well but who would of thought Argentina's defense is what got them to the final. Personally I thought they were very average. The rarely committed numbers forward. Rarely took any gambles. Were very rarely out of position. A losing finalist only scores 8 goals with a front line of Higuain, Messi, Di Maria and Aguero to start the tournament. Aguero was non-existent. Argentina took full advantage of their draw and were lucky to be in the final. A Swiss victory in the first round wouldn't of been any injustice to them. 

Yaya was disappointing. I thought the Ivory Coast could be thought of as the disappointment of the tournament. Spain was leading in their first game, fell apart and had a tough group. Ivory Coast should of been battling Colombia for top spot, not throwing away a game and 2nd place to Greece. (i predicted greece to not score a goal in the whole tournament....was within 50 minutes of their elimination when CIV decided to implode)

The thing about market-transfers are they are really expensive. Players know how popular they are and if they have to sign over image rights that can cost us a lot. The Kagawa transfer for example went that route, United made a play for a Japanese player and even though they got him really cheap he ended up with a substantial wage packet because they knew he'd be more valuable off the pitch. They were able to use his popularity in the East to push a lot of partnerships through, so in long run it worked for them. In the short term however they had to allocate a huge wage packet to him and potentially pass on more practical targets.

Dempsey obviously plays here now, but if you find a local broadcast you may get to hear former Tottenham goalkeeper Kasey Keller doing color commentary in the broadcast booth with Ross Fletcher, formerly of the BBC. Also, Harry Redknapp played for Sounders in the 70s.

Fun story: we had my work colleague along to a murder mystery party we hosted, the other year, and we (naturally) cast her as the American character. We introduced her to a friend of ours, who immediately upon hearing her voice, asked ""Oh!

Be aware that an American living in the UK isn't seen as an interesting novelty to quite the same extent as a Brit living in the USA. You'll get questions about where you come from, how it differs etc., but that'll be about it.

Make sure you know the difference between the terms (1) British Isles, (2) United Kingdom, (3) (Great) Britain, (4) England, etc., or there's a risk that you'll be thought of as ignorant (tip: they are, respectively, (1) the cluster of islands off the West of Europe, which includes the Republic of Ireland, a country in its own right, and the Channel Islands, which are Crown dependencies; (2) the state itself, consisting of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland: centrally-governed from London but increasingly with their own regional powers and laws, too, (3) the parts of Great Britain that aren't Northern Ireland, (4) the largest and most-populous country of the United Kingdom).

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; I believe you are confusing the latest ""Sexual offences act 2003"" and exploitation of minors as being the same date. There have been laws in the UK around exploitation of girls under 16 since ""Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885"". This act was only one to strengthen laws around explotation of women and children. So I have no doubt there are preceding laws or at least social stigmas.

I understand what you're saying:

[*""Section 45(2) changed the definition of ""child"" in the Protection of Children Act 1978 (which applies to child pornography) from a person under 16 to a person under 18""*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act_2003)

The Sexual Offences Act is what I was referring to. I'm aware there were laws protecting childeren around before then, but the Sexual Offences (in my understanding) changed the definition of child from 16 to 18. 

I don't doubt there were social stigmas, but my understanding (again, I don't consider myself to have 1st hand experience, I'm only early - mid 20's) is that the stigma of messing with a child was more akin to e.g. painting your house a colour that doesn't match the rest of the street: people might talk about it a little bit behind your back, but generally they don't let it change how they behave towards you. Whereas now, if you're messing with children, you'd best have enough money to move out of the local area before lynch mob gets you.

Obviously that's quite a simplified description, and would vary depending on all sorts of factors, but I hope you understand what I'm getting at. Before, my understanding is that it was seen as ""a little bit dodgy"" or ""questionable"" but now it's seen as ""revolting"" ""hideous"" and ""disgusting"".

Another indicator of how attitudes have changed in very recent times is the fact that with many of these scandals, the victims said they told people before, and everyone doubted or ignored them, whereas now, the idea of ignoring that sort of thing is seen as disgraceful. That doesn't equate to it being ""okay"" or ""fine"" in the past, but it shows that it wasn't seen as that big of a deal that it's worth reporting or following through with.

That's a very good point about the effects of social media and communication in general though - that may explain a lot.

Don't get me wrong isolating the different cannabinoids is useful for research purposes, for example epilepsy sufferers may want to avoid strains high in CBC because apparently that can actually increase the likelihood of having seizures, those suffering from mental illnesses would want to stick to strains that have a higher CBD:THC ratio for CBDs antiphyscotic properties. 

Overall the real medical benefits from the plant comes from whole plant extracts because without the plethora of cannabinoids and terpenes present in the natural plant you will not get anywhere near the same benefits. 

Sativex is whole a plant extract, they more or less use the same strains you find on the street here. They just have police protection and lab equipment to grow it.  I think that GW pharma should absolutely have the right to produce Sativex but they definitely shouldn't have a monopoly on it. Ideally everyone should have the right to either grow it themselves or buy it from a social club or even another pharmaceutical company if they so choose. 

We are talking about the safest substance known to man here, there is no safer alternative to natural cannabis. So far the synthetics we have produced have killed people. Why not allow people to buy Sativex as well as vaporise their own herb if they feel it will help them?

Key areas as in : Ramires needs to improve his first touch &amp; passing, Willian to improve his decision making / final product and I am quite sure Mourinho as coach and rest of coaching staff can still do it.

Yes, no marquee signing sucks. Losing Suarez sucks. But it wasn't our attack that was the problem last year, it was our defence (conceding 50 goals whilst trying to challenge for the title is stupid). Bringing in Lambert and (hopefully/potentially) Bony gives us a lot more depth upfront and we also have another kind of option in Bony. *We cannot keep having to score 3 or 4 goals just to win games. I'd take 1 or 2-0 wins over 5-4 or 3-2 wins...*

Last year we had massive problems when key players got injured or didn't perform. We were lucky Sturridge came back early from his injury to help out whilst Suarez was suspended. Having said that, look what happened when Jordan got suspended (for three games, imagine if he were injured for 9-10!!)... we had Lucas to come in, now at least we have some depth and other options. Johnson playing shit again? Aurier is there. Flanno not quite playing as well as he did last year, and Enrique's injured? Moreno's there. Etc... 

I'm really confident looking forward. I don't think we'll win the league this year, but I'm at least confident we'll stay in the Champions League spots...

These two bits I've highlighted clearly contradict one another. You cannot accuse me of failing to acknowledge the system is flawed by design and of taking those flaws as a given. My entire position is that the system is flawed but that a plausible significant improvement has yet to be suggested.

No. He's an *anonymous* source, his involvement with the subject matter is unclear - did the guy plant the bomb himself, did he make it, was he sitting in the next room drinking coffee and keeping watch for army patrols while it was being planned, and just heard about it from hearsay - there's no way of telling what he actually knows, there's no way of checking that he said what Routledge says he said, or even that he exists at all (unlike Wallace, of whom you can watch give televised interviews, or even request an interview yourself, if you like. The Statesman's informant, Lee Tracey, has since died). And even foregoing all that, all he's saying is the weak proposition that the INLA thought Neave might have been effective at combating Republicanism. Which doesn't contradict 99% of everything said about Neave from all sides. I believe that what's said there is likely accurate (Routlege met an INLA guy who said something close to the things quoted) but it mostly stands up because the content is so humdrum, nobody would feel the need to question it; if there was doubts about it's veracity, it wouldn't stand up by itself.

&gt;I only make the point about new statesman because the fact it was a mail link was criticised elsewhere

Not from me.

&gt;You know, trying to discover what it is that makes you say this sub is only 'supposedly' biased...

Because a lot of accusations of the origins of the bias tend to inaccurately place all criticism of loyalists or unionist politicians as hailing from the nationalist side, when a lot of it is from relatively young and liberal unionists. 'Relatively young and liberal' (regardless of nationalistic orientation) is the tendency that gives reddit subs the political tendencies they have, and that's likely what you're seeing here. When people like Lit-Up turn up with doctrinaire Republicanism, they tend to get downvoted into oblivion too.

I did also say that there were quite possibly more nationalists than unionists on the sub too, of course - but I also pointed out that it's totally irrelevant. Reddit isn't a monolithic source of one-sided party propaganda, the content is user-provided.

Even if we kept Suarez we should still be bringing in big names to play with him. Now that we're in the Champions League we need Champions League quality signings. We haven't made any signings in terms of defenders, or sold any players but the one most important to the team.

Adam Lallana: He's a really good player, had an amazing season but I would never pay 25m for him. This price is because of Southampton not wanting him to leave, him being a POTS nominee and he's English.

Rickie Lambert: He's good for depth, 4m wasn't a bad deal but I can't see him staying at the club for too long. 

Emre Can: 9.75m is a lot for a 20 year old who hasn't had much experience. I don't know where he's going to fit in at Liverpool. His strengths are his dribbling and his pace from what I've seen and I think he'd be wasted at CDM, assuming he plays like the role Gerrard does.

Lazar Markovic: I really believe that 20m could have been spent far better. I think we need to add quality to the squad right now, to compete in Champions League and do well in the league at the same time. I've seen him play quite a bit, watched many videos and I think he has very good potential. I don't see as to why we spent 20m on him now, at this point in his career especially.

Divock Origi: I wouldn't even risk this. Especially for 10m. He hasn't got much quality to bring to the team, even if he goes on loan for a season, and don't see him getting much playing time, at all.

&gt;Emre Can: 9.75m is a lot for a 20 year old who hasn't had much experience. I don't know where he's going to fit in at Liverpool. His strengths are his dribbling and his pace from what I've seen and I think he'd be wasted at CDM, assuming he plays like the role Gerrard does.

This is incorrect. 10m for a excellent German youngster coming up through the Bayern Munich youth set up and a full season loan at Leverkusen is not a lot of money. It's well worth the risk. With past managers stating how good a player he is. Bayern were very keen to keep hold of him.

&gt;His strengths are his dribbling and his pace from what I've seen and I think he'd be wasted at CDM, assuming he plays like the role Gerrard does.

From watching him at Leverkusen last season, he is box to box and plays very well where Lucas plays, he would be a natural replacement for Lucas rather than Gerrard. His strengths are he is strong, tackling and can break up play.

I had no idea that this guy lives in Mexico but if he does, that makes me suspect that it is the international media he is referring to.

Grimsby is pretty much fucked as a town, and has been since the Cod Wars.  There's a (pretty dim) light at the end of the tunnel in the form of off-shore wind servicing and Siemans are supposed to be building a manufacturing plant for wind turbines on the south bank of the Humber, but apart from that, Toyota and VW's sea landing and storage areas and the tourist trade that Cleethorpes generates for a couple of months a year there's not a lot going for the place.  

Road links are poor - East/West the M180 stops at the turn off for the Humber Bridge and turns in the concrete-paved A180 for the rest of it's stretch to Grimsby, heading south means using the single-carriageway A16 through Boston or a tangle of minor A-roads to bypass it, and north involves paying a toll to cross the Humber. The direct rail service to Manchester is rumoured to be under the axe and in any event services seem to spend 50% of their time being replaced by bus.

The real tragedy, is that this group wouldn't exist if the government managed to have an effective strategy for dealing with extremism, instead they're letting people like Anjem Choudary preach hatred openly, meanwhile Golding and other member of his organisation have to deal with the police, something which Britain First themselves point out, only leading to increased popularity and support. 

http://i.imgur.com/OWX1tyZ.jpg

&gt; It is clear that Britain First’s activity amounts to racially or religiously aggravated harassment, which is a criminal offence under Sections 31 and 32 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001). Racially or religiously aggravated harassment is no minor offence – it carries a potential two-year prison sentence.

Any attempt to prosecute any of them will lead to a media shitstorm and them receiving a lot more support. It also depends on what you would call harassment and then you'd have to show that is is religiously aggravated, most of the media published only shows their actions as not necessarily being a continued harassment, but rather a few individual protests and communications in buildings that are open to the public.

&gt;It should be noted that the harassment of Crayford mosque by Britain First involved a threat to remove the women’s entrance sign from outside the building. If Golding were to carry out that threat, he would be committing racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage, which is an offence under Section 30 of the Crime and Disorder Act and carries a potential 14-year prison sentence.

Again, you have to prove that this is religiously aggravated, which is very difficult for a prosecutor to do when it is a sign saying ""women only"", even if he is found guilty there would be no way that he would receive a 14-year sentence.

I wouldn't consider their attempted actions are pathetic, they've done a reasonably good job of raising funds and promoting their group, without any of the backlash that the EDL received from its street marches.

But I'm conscious of the fact that she's a Christian who voted against gay marriage because of her personal beliefs.  Despite that she is, and continues to be the Minister for Women and Equalities as well as landing the job of Minister for Education.

Incidentally, my own MP (Anne Milton, Guildford) wrote to me (in response to me contacting her) explaining why she voted against gay marriage, saying (more or less) that she felt duty bound to represent her constituents regardless of her own personal opinion.  She had received many, many letters, etc., from people who were opposed to it and very few from those in support.

In fact, the reason I wrote to her in the first place was because I got a flier through the door from a local Christian group encouraging me to write to the MP and tell how how much against gay marriage I was.  Instead I took the opportunity to write to offer my support, which is how the dialogue began.

I had to begrudgingly respect the decision she made, even though I didn't agree with it.  But it did give me an interesting insight into the dilemma that many politicians face: do I do what I think is right, what my constituents tell me to do, or what my party whip tells me to do?  I imagine the three rarely coincide.

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Serious question, what's the idea behind 2% being the target rate? Is the idea that it's the right balance to keep people spending with out hoarding money while not scaring people with massive price rises?

Yes. The idea is that you want a little bit of inflation because it gives you leeway if things start to deflate. Japan is a good example of what happens when inflation rates go weird. In my opinion we're heading the same way.

&gt;I've been saving for years now but in fact been losing money as my savings interest rate has always been lower than inflation.

In the olden days it made sense to save money with a bank. Banks needed deposits to leverage and lend out so interest rates were reasonable. Now banks can effectively just print as much money as they need and offset any risk by buying a variety of other products. The value of fiat money (printed / issued) is dropping through the floor as a result.

Another problem is that the headline inflation figures are so heavily molested they doesn't reflect reality. Changes in the way CPI is measured results in very different inflation figures (CPI is significantly lower than reality imo), it's an unfortunately subjective measurement of something that ought to be objective. The discrepancy is effectively lost purchasing power for those who have only been receiving CPI / RPI increases in income, eg, the non-capital owning classes.

Interest rates need to return to historical norms if things are going to get better but I can't see that happening any time soon.

Capabilities which have been [declared by the European Court of Justice](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-04/cp140054en.pdf) to breach several citizens' rights, which is why the ECJ struck them down.

&gt; The Court takes the view that, by requiring the retention of those data and by allowing the 
competent national authorities to access those data, the directive interferes in a particularly 
serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection 
of personal data. Furthermore, the fact that data are retained and subsequently used without the
subscriber or registered user being informed is likely to generate in the persons concerned a 
feeling that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance. 

But the Government doesn't want to lose what it had.

But you don't have to have the same experiences as the people you lead to be a good leader. That's what empathy is. You don't need to be homeless to know how you can help a homeless person, you don't need to be from a minority to know how minorities in this country should be treated. 

&gt;Strawman. If we're going to discuss MP's pay then it might be a good idea to look at...you know...MP's pay. Answer the point or concede it but don't try any fucking salsa sidestep bullshit.

I don't know what you mean by this, or what the point you think I am sidestepping is. My point is that linking MPs wages to minimum wage is absolutely meaningless, it doesn't achieve what you want it to achieve. If you want MPs wages to reflect national wages, then link it to the average wage of the country. But that still is a bad idea. 

&gt;Corporations have a lot less power, social responsibility and mandate than politicians. 

In other words, their job is a lot less important, and so had less value, which I agree with, and which is why  MPs should be paid more. 

&gt;Funnily enough I don't believe any of that. I believe that MPs have a challenging job, yes. I believe that they work decent hours and should be paid a decent wage.

Then you have a very strange view of what it means to be compensated for such a challenging job. How much do you think MPs should be paid?

&gt;you cannot otherwise justify nearly doubling the wages of a person without any increased bang for your buck UNLESS you emphasise just how hard they work

No, what I've said from the beginning is that MPs have been underpaid since the 80's which is a matter of historical record. The pay rise isn't because they are doing a better job, it is to put them in the correct pay bracket, and end the problems of expenses.  

&gt;Answer me this at least, and try not to sidestep. Would increasing an MP's wage to a hundred grand a year improve the quality of MP that we receive?


Yes. For several reasons. 

Increasing their wage and ending expenses would mean that no more MPs would ever again abuse the expenses system. The abuse happened because the system was in place. If your place of work allowed you to put a second home on expenses, you, along with the vast majority of people in this country would do it. The abuse didn't happen because MPs are evil moral lacking people, most people would have done the same in their position. 

Increasing their wage to £100,000 makes the job more attractive to highly skilled intelligent people who can make that kind of money in the private sector, but cannot at the moment as an MP. People from the medical industries, business leaders, and other talented people, who could offer so much to politics. People often complain about how bad career politicians are, and that we need to attract people with experience in the private sector, however, many of those people by the time they have the experience that we want in our politicians are making far more than an MP, and it is very difficult for them to take such a large cut in pay, especially when they may have a family that they have been supporting at that income level. 

If you are a highly skilled young person with a lot of potential, and you are considering where you want your career to lead, your salary is going to be an important consideration. At the moment, if you want a good salary for your skills, your only option is to go into the private sector, which means that our top talent often doesn't even consider politics as a career, and the only young people who get interested in politics are those who have very rich families, and so for whom their salary isn't a problem. Just look at the main politicians from all the major parties. All of them, including all three party leaders come from very affluent backgrounds. If they didn't have that advantage growing up, do you think they would still have gotten into politics? 

&gt;Certainltly. It could be argued that at any time when a sitting administration was re-elected in a fair and democratic election that the majority of people were happy with the Government. Which means most European countres, England included, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and a few other Asian nations have all had people at varying points in modern history alone that have been happy with their Government.

So would you be ok with MPs raising their salaries after a re-election? Perhaps after Tony Blair was re-elected? When the whole country was happy with him and no-one had a bad thing to say about him or the government? Somehow I doubt it. Like I said, there has never been a time when when the majority of people has been happy with their government. And remember, no party has won an election by being voted in by the majority of people who can vote for a very long time, all recent elections have been won by a minority. 

&gt;Give every fired nurse, trooper, cop, fireman and civil servant their job back and increase investment in our health service, construction of housing, reform the police service to re-introduce policing by consent and actually punish the occasional fucks that ruin it for everyone else rather than just give them a slap on the wrist when people in their custody end up dead. Close the tax loopholes, start actually engaging with Europe rather than acting like a spoilt child, communicate with people, earn back their trust, THEN we can start discussing pay.

I can't comment on every decision that has been made, but they have all been made for a reason, cutting waste, over subscribed prisons, cutting red tape, there are lots of reasons these decisions may have been made. And this goes to prove my point. People will always have bad things to say about government decisions, but it doesn't mean they were the wrong decisions to make. 

&gt;If you upped the pay to a hundred grand tomorrow but kept the expenses system, do you still think we'd see MPs abusing the fuck out of it?

Yes, but if you had an over generous expenses system where you work, would you and the people you work with take as much from it as you could? Yes you would, and so would the vast majority of people in this country. It has nothing to do with morality, its like the tax avoidance issue, people will never voluntarily pay more than they have to, so fix the system, don't blame people when they use it.

Of course if there was such a catastrophically low turnout at a general election no party - whether they have a majority or not - could realistically claim a legitimate mandate to govern. There would be protests from all sides, the election would be declared null and void and a new one would be re-scheduled. Rinse and repeat.

The AV Referendum in 2011 had a turnout of [around 42%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13297573) and that was low enough for some people (the 'losers') to dispute its legitimacy. General Elections, on the other hand, usually have a much higher [turnout of around 70%](http://www.ukpolitical.info/Turnout45.htm).

Some countries - notably [Australia](http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/Compulsory_Voting.htm) - have laws making voting compulsory to avoid this kind of scenario. That's at the extreme end of the scale, but it would be generally acceptable to have a minimum turnout (say at the very least 50% of the electorate) to make an election valid, bu that's difficult to enforce and may result in a large number of failed elections.

It is a way to make this years books look better at the expense of next years. Unless you think whatever company buys them is going to give more money than the debt is worth?

But yeah, [erudio](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/may/20/student-loan-erudio-under-fire) is no different to how the government was doing things.

&gt; One of the biggest issues is that Erudio has written to around 45,000 people who defer repayments to say their details will now be given to credit reference agencies.

&gt; Previously, even though the SLC's terms and conditions said it could pass information on deferred loans to the agencies, only defaulted, not deferred, loans appeared on credit records.

Yes, SLC is bad. But a debt collection agency?

[And as for that ""contract""...
](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/13/raise-interest-rate-student-loans-secret-report)

&gt; At the moment, the interest on all student loans taken out before 2012 is capped. Graduates pay interest at either the RPI measure of inflation or banks' base rate plus 1%, whichever is lower.

&gt; But in the privatisation study, Rothschild found that the rate-cap was a major deterrent to potential investors, who worried that if inflation outstripped the base rate they would lose out on returns.

&gt; In order to sell as much of the loan book as possible, the financiers advise that the government underwrite the risk with a financial instrument called a synthetic hedge, in effect using the public finances to guarantee returns to private investment.

&gt; Alternatively, they suggest dumping the cap on loan rates altogether. If that proves impossible, the team suggest ""an 'offer of compromise', including a payment holiday, or an interest-free period or a different cap"".

As for your issue with it sometimes jumping to the channel, it depends on whether you've pressed select first or not - if you just type the channel number it'll jump to it, however if the bar is up and you type the number it will show you the channel info instead. 

Also, whenever you press guide it takes you to the top, it doesn't start on what channel you're on. The channel +/1 will take you up and down pages at a time.

First things first, there is no difference between a shoulder check and a life-saver (or at least, none except when you do them) so don't worry about distinguishing the two. Just remember that immediately before changing direction you should always do a shoulder check. For example, leaving a roundabout, changing lanes, pulling out into traffic, etc.

One other occassion where you should do a shoulder check where you might not be changing direction is when two lanes merge into one and you are in the lane that continues. Just as you would if you were in the merging lane, always shoulder check before the merge ends to make sure no one is sneaking up on you.

As for the order of doing things, you should never indicate without having first checked your mirror. So, when changing direction it is: (1) mirror, (2) if there is a space then indicate, (3) mirror-shoulder, (4) move. It is exactly the same when pulling out into traffic - you shouldn't indicate until there is a space, then as soon as you indicate you should shoulder check and move out. The only exception to not putting your indicator on until you know there is a gap is if you are in slow-moving traffic, and putting your indicator on can indicate to others and they may create a space for you.

As for moving off from a stop, just check over both shoulders and move. You can do this before the lights change, and then make it clear you are then continuously checking your mirrors. If it has been more than about 20 secs since you shoulder-checked and you are still sitting at the lights, do more checks before moving off. Remember, if you position your bike to the left side when turning left, it eliminates any space for someone to come up on that side so you then just need to check your right shoulder.

If I think of anything else I'll add it later, but this is how I handled my mod 2 and I got 0 minors ;-)

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"Here's the thing; Newcastle changed the full name of the stadium to Sports Direct Arena, but most Newcastle fans kept right on calling it ""St. James' Park"". Here in the States, it's relatively common; for instance, [Sports Authority Field at Mile High Stadium](http://www.sportsauthorityfieldatmilehigh.com) is where the Denver Broncos play. Guess what? *Everyone still calls it Mile High* except for TV broadcasters, and the Broncos still get their money.

Even in places where teams just give away the name of the Stadium, if it was a memorable/important stadium and name, people here just keep right on using the old name. Does it seem silly now? Sure. But if we just keep right on calling it White Hart Lane, *and it will be at White Hart Lane*, then what difference does it make. It's not that different from reclaiming ""yid"" - all we have to do is ignore them ragging us about selling *a part* of the name. Hell, we can even sing about it. ""We play at the LAaaaaane, we play at the LAaaaaane, We're Tottenham Hotspur, We play at the Lane.""

My point is this; it seems ridiculous because it's new. But if we can get an extra 20 or 30 million pounds a year because Sainsbury's or Aston Martin or whoever get to have their name come before ""White Hart Lane"" when broadcasters say it? Why not do that. That's a sizeable chunk of change that can help us get to and stay in the Champion's League, and unlike Arsenal, who've sold the soul of their stadium to the Emirates, *We would still be at the Lane*.

&gt;

&gt;On 10 November 2011, Newcastle United announced that the stadium would officially be renamed the Sports Direct Arena, as a temporary measure to ""showcase the sponsorship opportunity to interested parties"", whilst looking for a sponsor for possible future stadium re-branding. According to the club, the St James' Park title was dropped as not being ""commercially attractive"". 

&gt;Previously, in 2009, the club had announced plans to sell the naming rights for the stadium. After protests about the possible loss of the name of the stadium, which included the tabling of an [early day motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_day_motion) in Parliament, the club clarified the following week that the move would not involve the loss of the name St James' Park altogether, citing the example of 'SportsDirect.com@StJamesPark' as a potential stadium rights package.   The following day, the club announced that the stadium would be known as the sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium temporarily until the end of the season, to showcase the idea behind the package, until the new sponsor was announced. 

&gt;The stadium's official renaming as the Sports Direct Arena, or SDA, caused considerable perturbation amongst Magpie supporters, some of whom resorted to criminal damage to preserve the stadium's previous name.

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"[Here's](http://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2014/07/14/tom-hickman-on-the-drip-bill-plugging-gaps-in-surveillance-laws-or-authorising-the-unlawful/)  a detailed analysis of the Bill, and what it does and does not solve.

&gt; The DRIP Bill does not attempt to meet the requirements articulated by the CJEU. (nor do the draft regulations, now available, which will be made under the Act when passed). 

[...]
&gt; It is remarkable that the Government has not attempted to address the issues raised by the CJEU in [Digital Rights Ireland](http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/eu/cases/EUECJ/2013/C29312_O.html&amp;query=digital+and+rights+and+ireland&amp;method=boolean) and is introducing a law which appears straightforwardly incompatible with the right to privacy and contrary to a court judgment which is binding on the UK Parliament.

&gt; The second hole that DRIP Bill is seeking to plug is entirely unconnected with the ruling of the CJEU and with the Data Protection Directive. [...] government agencies have been requiring companies based overseas to intercept communications or facilitate the interception of communications on behalf of UK government agencies. It seems that these foreign companies have begun to doubt that the UK government has any power to do this.

There's this new power in the Bill, which has nothing to do with the European Court of Justice judgement:

&gt; Clause 4 of the DRIP Bill makes express provision for service of interception warrants on companies abroad. [...] The Government can obtain a warrant for blanket interception of external communications on the basis that this is necessary in the interests of national security. Conditions on the search of such material should be imposed under the warrant, but these are not set out in law and the scope and nature of any such protections are unknown.  
&gt; [...]  
&gt; The full consequences of the power have not been explained and given the fast-track procedure, they will not be the subject of parliamentary scrutiny before the bill becomes law.   
&gt; [...]  
&gt; These provisions have not been triggered by an event or judgment such as the decision in the Digital Rights Ireland case.  ",0,1405422420,null,0,1405423503,0,cixwwd4,t3_2ar1rr,t1_cixwwd4,t1_cixwpvu,null,1434723658,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It is very different from the Eddies at Gough Street, there's a lot less seating due to it being a club venue rather than a social club (I'm not sure how much you know about the Tunnel Club/Subway City), so if you're looking to just sit and chill it's probably not what you're looking for. That being said there is the pool table room upstairs which has some seating and a much more chilled atmosphere, and there are the odd seats around in all the other rooms, such as the balcony in the main room and a few along the sides in the new dungeon and 80's rooms.

Musicwise it is exactly the same, each of the old rooms has a double in the new venue, although the main and 80s rooms doubles are considerably smaller, leading to a much bigger turn out in the new dungeon.

The smoking area is also a lot smaller (but the owners of the venue are appealing to the council to allow them to make it bigger), although apparently some people have said there is a larger smoking area out the back but I haven't been able to confirm this myself.

The atmosphere is generally a lot more clubby, because as I mentioned the venue is designed to be a nightclub and not a social club, but the people are mostly the same, I still recognised a good number of the old Eddies people, and it had a surprising turnout both the opening night and the post-Sonisphere second opening.

My initial point is that i think it depends how we set up. Mourinho proved that point last season.

Oscar overall might be the better player going forward but i think that if we're grinding out games (like Liverpool at Anfield last year) then i still think i'd pick Willian for his defensive qualities.

I do agree that Willian needs some polish though, he got better on the counter as the season went on, but the only real goal i remember him scoring on the break was the tap in vs Liverpool.

* I cannot stress enough to not eat at any restaurant that has pictures of its food, but to be fair most of them will manage to turn you off doing so *with* those pictures so maybe you could work that out yourself

* http://www.alleduegondolette.com/ - Go to Trattoria Alle Due Gondoletti for lunch and ask to sit in the garden - it's a bit of a walk but go and visit some art galleries/architecture exhibitions in the same area and its totally worth it. The waitress there doesn't speak English but you can get by with a little bit of Italian - keep in mind to order primi and secondi piatti to keep in their good books (first and second course) and thank them ('Grazie') lots! Their wine is cheap, just ask for a carafe ('quarto'). Don't be freaked out when they bring red wine out cold, it's actually really nice wine.

* On the sea front in the student area (Dorsoduro) in the South there is a very old gelateria called Gelateria Nico - go there for real ice cream :)

* Buy a map as soon as you arrive and don't make the mistake I did of not working out where the hotel was before you got there...

* Recommendation for dinner - go to *bacari* - Venetian tapas bars. So tasty, so cheap, much drinking to be had. My favourite was the oldest - Cantina do Mori, which was near our hotel. Ask for the Francobolli (Italian for 'postage stamps') basically tiny little overloaded sandwiches - the piccante one (spicy) is totally great. I think they're one euro each, get six at once. Cheap tasty wine too. All' Arco is around the corner from that one but we never managed to go when it was open, it is also supposed to be good.

Hope you enjoy yourselves! We had a great time :)

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Look at the facts about the CB situation and you can see why he's the most likely to leave:

- We're after Lovren; we already have 4 senior CB's in Sakho, Toure, Skrtel and Agger. Plus 3 young-ish potential CB prospects in Kelly, Wisdom and Ilori. Thus, if we sign Lovren, someone must leave.

- Sakho, having cost 17m and having the all-round competence Rodgers wants in a CB, will be given every chance to become a first XI fixture.

- Toure only has one year left on his contract; no real value to be recouped in selling him, and with his experience and personality, may as well keep him on. Equally, if we do sell him; he's 4th-choice CB, something neither Agger nor Skrtel will be happy being. That ""4th-choice CB"" place in the hierarchy would most likely be taken over by Kelly/Ilori/Wisdom.

- So one of Skrtel and Agger has to go to accommodate Lovren. Of the two, which would be happier being 3rd-choice CB? Which would be more likely to be used alongside Sakho AND Lovren? I'd say Skrtel. So, Agger's the one leaving if we bring Lovren/an alternative first-XI CB in.",0,1405426877,null,0,false,0,cixxydk,t3_2ar0va,t1_cixxydk,t1_cixwygv,null,1434724257,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

And as far as the rotation. Kompany plays when Kompany is healthy. They give him time off when possible.

My main question is;

* Who else is there who we can drive us into champions league?

* What if we spend a fuck ton on them and turn out cant score in the PL?

The second one is major.

You are right we don't have money to waste, but do we have the money to buy a $15 mil striker for a 6 goal season? I would argue 25mil for Lukaku is the safest bet we have, we know he will score 15 goals a season atleast and hes 21, hes not going to drop in price if it doesn't work out we can sell him without a loss, shit we could even make money off him like Jelavic.

 He will only get better and we won't qualify for champions league without a gun forward, not in this league.

The real question is can we afford to buy Lukaku and still have a big enough/ good enough squad to play in europe and domestic?

That said, I'm also rather anxious. I think we need to bring in a big, proven attacking player to limit the damage of Suarez leaving as much as possible. He can't be replaced by any one player, but finding someone worth 20+ goals on their own will make a huge difference. I also think that we need another reliable, goalscoring and dangerous forward because Sturridge is not going to stay fit for 46+ games.  If that 20+ goal player happens to be a very good forward then we're killing 2 birds with 1 stone. I hope we keep the diamond with 2 strikers as a viable option because it is absolutely when we, and Sturridge especially, looked most lethal last season.

---

&gt;

&gt;The term __Night of the Long Knives__ in British politics is used for a major [Cabinet reshuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_reshuffle) that took place on 13 July 1962. [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom) [Harold Macmillan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Macmillan) dismissed seven members of his [Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government\)), one-third of the total. The speed and scale of the reshuffle caused it to be associated by its critics with the 1934 [Night of the Long Knives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives) in Germany.

&gt;The reshuffle took place against a backdrop of declining Conservative popularity in Britain. Conservative candidates fared poorly in several [by-elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-election), losing ground to [Liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK\)) candidates. Concerned that traditional Conservative voters were expressing their disapproval with the government's economic policies by switching to the Liberals, Harold Macmillan planned to replace his [Chancellor of the Exchequer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer), [Selwyn Lloyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selwyn_Lloyd), with [Reginald Maudling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Maudling). Lloyd had already clashed with Macmillan over his economic strategies, and Maudling was considered to be more amenable to the economic policies Macmillan wished to implement. The reshuffle was also an attempt to reinvigorate the party, bringing in younger and more dynamic figures and replacing some of the older and less capable ministers. After discussions with [Conservative Party Chairman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Conservative_Party) [Iain Macleod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Macleod) and [Home Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary) [Rab Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rab_Butler), a reshuffle was planned for Autumn 1962.

&gt;Macmillan was overtaken by events when Butler leaked the details of the reshuffle to press baron [Lord Rothermere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmond_Harmsworth,_2nd_Viscount_Rothermere) over lunch on 11 July. The newspapers reported the impending changes on 12 July, and Macmillan made the decision to press ahead with the reshuffle at once. Lloyd was called to a meeting that evening and dismissed. The remaining six were informed the following day, 13 July. Macmillan faced sharp criticism over the scale of the changes, and his political opponents both within the Conservative Party and in the [Opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Most_Loyal_Opposition_(United_Kingdom\)) characterised him as ruthless and opportunistic. Despite an initial sharp drop in his approval ratings, opinion eventually swung back in his favour and the Party recovered. Macmillan regretted the way the reshuffle was carried out, and was particularly concerned about his treatment of Lloyd, who was a loyal confidant. Despite the dramatic changes in the Cabinet, the Conservatives were rocked by a series of scandals in 1963, causing Macmillan to eventually resign as Prime Minister, before the Party's defeat in the [1964 general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1964).

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"Here is Andrew Millers Response (also Cheshire MP)

*******************


Thank you for contacting me regarding temporary legislation the Government are bringing forward on communication data interception. This follows two recent developments. First, the European Court of Justice has struck down regulations enabling internet providers to retain communications data for law enforcement purposes for up to 12 months. This legislation will enable agencies to maintain existing capabilities. It will respond to the ECJ judgement on data retention and bring clarity to existing law in response to CSP’s requests.
 
 The Labour opposition have secured agreement from the government that this emergency legislation will be temporary - it will expire in 2016. We have also secured agreement to a major independent review of the legal framework governing surveillance (as we called for four months ago) so that there can be a proper public and Parliamentary debate over what the longer term legislation and arrangements should be. The Government has also agreed to a new Privacy and Civil Liberties Board, something for which I have argued for years.
 
 The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. The Labour opposition, and I agree, believe that data and intelligence is needed - especially for tackling serious crime, online crime and preventing terrorism. Last year the Child Exploitation and Online Protection agency received 18,887 reports of child abuse – an increase of 14% on the year. Without this sort of information these abusers would be impossible to find and stop.
 
 However, we also believe more safeguards and stronger oversight are needed, as well as reforms because the legislation is out of date given new technology. I will support my labour colleagues to scrutinise the detail of the Government's proposals, but we will support the temporary legislation as it would be far too damaging to the fight against serious crime, online child abuse and counter terrorist intelligence to suddenly lose these capabilities now.
 
 Bluntly, all investigations into online child sex abuse and major investigations into terrorism and organised crime, including preventing young people from travelling to Syria, would fall entirely or be in severe jeopardy. Without it:
 •the police efforts to catch paedophiles sharing child abuse images through online networks would be hampered.
 •The mobile phone records that helped police find out about the attempted terrorist attack at Glasgow airport in 2007 would no longer be available.
 •And the security services wouldn’t have been able to check who the Woolwich attackers had contacted to make sure there were no further attacks planned.
 
 Some people have argued that this is being rushed. However, I believe it to be a necessary timetable, indeed it should have been tabled earlier. There will have to a longer term re-think when the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board has been created and as the contentious part of the legislation has a “sunset clause” (it ceases to have effect after a fixed period), this consideration has been met.
 
 Thank you for letting me know your views on this important issue.
 
 Yours sincerely

3. It puts an additional burden on students (i.e. the effective cost of education on the nation as a whole is now higher).

4. It actually puts people off going to university to begin with.

So who benefits? I suppose the hordes of administrators who now need to be hired to manage this clusterfuck qualify as beneficiaries. As do the private companies who'll get the debt packaged up under terms they can't lose on.

&gt;__Allegory__ is a [rhetorical device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_device) in which characters or events in a literary, visual, or musical art form represent or symbolize ideas and concepts. Allegory has been used widely throughout the histories of all forms of art; a major reason for this is its immense power to illustrate complex ideas and concepts in ways that are easily digestible and tangible to its viewers, readers, or listeners. An allegory conveys its hidden message through [symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol) figures, actions, imagery, and/or events. Allegory is generally treated as a figure of [rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric); a rhetorical allegory is a demonstrative form of representation conveying meaning other than the words that are spoken.

Take from that what you will, but Stefan Collini has written very comprehensively about what the increase in tuition fees *actually* means for British universities.

The short version is they removed the block grant funding and therefore unis have to make up that funding from the tuition fees. This means that unis have to essentially market their degrees to 17 year olds who have never been to University and, respectfully, don't know how courses are meant to be structured. One very obvious result of this is that Unis will spend proportionally more and more money on marketing than on teaching (which is happening right now).

It's a very dogmatic competition ideology which posits the 17 year old as a rational consumer able to make a completely informed choice about the degree he or she takes. The rationale being that if degree courses don't get enough funding from tuition fees, it's because they weren't good enough courses. It also means that courses which may not have some *immediate* market value might end up being under-funded. Then there's loads of ridiculous research targets and ""impact values"" academics have to adhere to, which are stupid for separate reasons.

The main argument against it is that, for the most part, *UK Universities are pretty good*.

Before going to PSG, he dominated the Serie A. People shit on him for not producing for Uruguay, but Uruguay was a team that was built around Suarez. Tabarez failed to build a well-rounded team. Cavani was forced to drop back into his own third of the field (as he usually does anyways) in order to get the ball. Our midfield was not consistent. If you saw our play, we tried to attack from the sides with players who just weren't capable of doing so (i.e. Tata Gonzalez). Cavani had little to no chances provided for him.  

Cavani is/was one of the hardest working players in the Uruguayan squad. I feel like the system that BR already has in place would be a great one for Cavani to be successful in. He wouldn't be forced to drop back as much, there are players who can actually feed him the ball, he's a proven striker and he's still got a good 5-6 years left in him.

However the government's PREVENT strategy resulted in early criticism that is was grouping a wide range of behavioirs - both legitimate and criminal - into the category of 'extremist', with some saying that it would be counter-productive and would inadvertently drive some towards political extremism.

However, at the same time it was argued that the PREVENT strategy didn't go far enough, and focused too much on Islamist ideology when social factors - particularly gang membership and economic alienation - were more relavent to radicalisation.

There is nothing necessary wrong with what the police did without knowing the facts. The government's counter-radicalisation approach is flexible enough that the police's actions does not necessarily mean that they believed he ticked the boxes for potential extremist and/or terrorist. 

However, the police prpbably need to be more consistent, as PREVENT is about radicalisation in general and was never meant to focus entirely on Islamism. The main problem with stories like this is that it may create the perception that it was the man's religous/cultural identity, ad not just his actions, that prompted the letter and that others acting in a similar manner but from different religious/cultural backgrounds wouldn't recieve the same treatment.

true,_CDUB_,null,null,"We all need to start being a little clearer with what we mean when we say that Capaldi is the 12th, 13th, or 14th Doctor. It only gets confusing because we don't know what the Doctors real name is, and because of internet pedantry.  
  
Here is what I propose: Let's just for a second pretend that the Doctors real name is Henry. Hurt is the ninth Henry, but not the ninth Doctor. At the end of The Day of the Doctor he redeems himself, but time snaps back into place and he doesn't remember that he saved Gallifrey. If you spent thousands of years hating who you were at one point in time, you'd be reluctant to admit he was you too, even if you learned your hatred was unfounded. So, at this point, Hurt is the ninth Henry only, while Eccleston is the tenth Henry, but only the ninth Doctor.  
  
Now onto Tennant. At the start of his life, he is the eleventh Henry, but the tenth Doctor. When he regenerates in Journeys End, he stays himself. He is still only the eleventh Henry and the tenth Doctor, however he has one less regeneration left. His body never changed, it only healed. At this point, he has one regeneration left, while still only being the eleventh Henry and the tenth Doctor.  
  
Onto Smith. At the start of his life he has done everything he can to ignore that Hurt existed. He's lied to himself so much that he actually occasionally believes his own lies. Additionally, like us fans, he doesn't realize that his use of regeneration energy while he was Tennant counted as a regeneration, so on any given day Smith probably thinks he has one or two regenerations left when in fact he has zero left. This is why he thinks he can still regenerate in The Impossible Astronaut. While we are on that topic, it was NEVER Smith in the opening of that episode, it was ALWAYS the Tesselecta. This means when River shot him and he starts to regenerate, he never actually did, it was all a hologram by the Tesselecta. In Let's Kill Hitler, the Doctor thinks he can regenerate, and talks to the TARDIS. It is very literal with what it says to him. He never asked if he COULD regenerate, he simply said that he was going to, to which the TARDIS correctly told him his regenerative abilities were disabled due to the poison of the Judas tree, which they were... he just ALSO didn't have any regenerations left, but he didn't ask about that. So there was no lying or misinformation involved here, just the correct information being given and misinterpreted. Now this is where I get speculative. I believe that after River gave up her remaining regenerations to revive the Doctor, he checked into how many he had left and realized he had none. However, we need to remember that River is not a true Time Lord. She's a human with some Time Lord abilities, of which regeneration is one. I believe that this means her regenerations aren't as potent to a true Time Lord. This would mean that she was powerful enough to bring the Doctor back to life, and put a little extra disposable regeneration energy into him. Not enough for a full new body, but enough to heal some wounds, or transfer back to River in Angels Take Manhattan. So, back to Smith, once he gets to Christmas on Trenzalore, he knows he is the twelfth Henry, but the eleventh Doctor, and he realizes that he also has no regenerations left. He attempts too sacrifice himself when he knows he is about to die of old age, when he's granted another cycle of twelve regenerations by the Time Lords, so he's able to reset then regenerate into Capaldi.  
  
This means that Capaldi is at the begging of a new set of regenerations. He is the thirteenth Henry, twelfth Doctor, and has eleven regenerations of the new cycle left because he used one to become Capaldi.  
  
tl;dr: be more clear when you use the term ""Doctor"" as to what you're specifically referring to. Use of regeneration energy, incarnation, or Time Lord who calls himself the Doctor cannot all have the same term to describe them.",0,1405432645,null,0,1405432866,0,cixzxr7,t3_2ap434,t1_cixzxr7,t3_2ap434,null,1434725134,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

&gt; August 25th 2012, John Henry and his GM decide to pull off one of the most shocking trades in MLB history getting rid of 2 huge superstars, and shedding a quarter of a billion $$ in contact fees.

3 players who were wildly under performing. Beckett, Crawford and Gonzalez. Only one was playing at anything close to ""superstar"" status at this point in their career and all three were problems in the clubhouse (Beckett was overweight and caught in the famous ""chicken and beer"" scandal.)

&gt; Red Sox fans where scared of rebuilding, after years of hunting for a title this was the team that had finally challenged and won a few.

THe last time they had won a World Series was 2007, and they had not made the playoffs since 2009. It was a team that desperately *needed* a rebuild and fans were calling for it. *FSG WERE AFRAID TO REBUILD* because they feared viewership on NESN would plummet in an off year, and that they would turn away fair weather fans.


&gt; In return they got a whole load of unheralded ""prospects""

They got James Loney (a veteran utility player), Iván DeJesús (a career minor league player), Allen Webster (a notable prospect), Jerry Sands (veteran utility player) and Rubby De La Rosa (notable prospect).

&gt; Fast forward to last year the team shocked everyone and won the title spurred on by youth and there veteran captain with a penchant for smashing long spectacular Home Runs

WRONG WRONG WRONG. None of the players they recieved in the trade played a notable part in the team. In fact, only Allen Webster played, and appeared in relief roles. They assembled a cheap team of veterans on short contracts in order to bridge the gap between the 2012 season and 2014 when some of their own prospects would be ready for the majors. Coincidentally, the veterans they signed wildly outperformed and they ended up World Series champions.

&gt; Part of the reason I love FSG and why they excite me is they have been there done that, there are differences between baseball and football, but they love building teams long term, there vision is never just 2-3 years away it is about the future, and they win it has worked! They are great owners and we are lucky, but stick with this I would rather invest in good solid young players than anything else and build long term

Not really. In fact, in Boston, FSG has been derided over the past few years for spending too much money on marketing and buying players we don't need and not allowing players to develop. In the famous words of John Henry, *""Larry Lucchino runs the Red Sox""*. They have focused a lot more on the *marketability* of the Red Sox team than the actual product on the field. Hence them courting big name players who are not actually that good, or at leats not good enough to warrant the contracts they have been offered. [They signed Crawford not because they needed him, but because they were afraid of not having marquee named players](http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Oh-Henry-Red-Sox-owner-8216-opposed-8217-C?urn=mlb-wp24094) and losing tv viewership. There has also been an embracing of ""pink hats"" (a term used to describe *mostly* female fans who only support the team when they are good and do not follow them on a regular basis, or do not go to games to actually watch the game--this may be hard for an English football fan to understand, but Fenway has been famously called ""the best bar in Boston"" because many people go there to just drink and ""see and be seen""-- and these fans have a proclivity for wearing [kitschy pink hats](http://cache.boston.com/resize/bonzai-fba/Globe_Photo/2008/06/25/1214439752_1506-1/539w.jpg)

Hell, they had their embarrassing ""sell out streak"" where they would purchase unsold tickets through their ACE Ticket platform to claim that they were still selling out games, even though most of the outfield was empty during games. All of this coincided with their cheesy 100 Years of Fenway year-long celebration, that had [it's own embarrassing theme song](http://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2012/03/john_williams_composes_fanfare.html)

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stop trying to shoehorn ""similarities"" between FSG running the Red Sox and Liverpool into discussions about the team. They are different business entities, they are run differently, and outside of John Henry have different management teams. As someone from Boston who ardently follows both the Red Sox and Liverpool, it makes me cringe reading these posts that are not based in any facts.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"Housing and land is a classic hoarding problem. Whereby the price of a product can be forced up by restricting the supply artificially. That is what building companies are doing.

What you need to do is counteract the expectation. Instead of price increases, create an environment in which the expectation is that prices will come down. Then the bodies hoarding will seek to clear their stock. The backlog of plots sitting there untouched will suddenly come under development. Contrary to intuition, price drops will cause far more building as companies seek to escape their position. The only way to do this is to develop and clear while the prices are as good as they are.

The interesting thing in this situation is the government is complicit with the hoarders whereas historically the government has been the one trying to smash the hoarding. We don't even need any incredible intervention like with past hoarding problems (say the detachment from the gold standard when money was being hoarded during deflation). We need the government to stop artificially restricting the supply of land.

Once all this is done you crucially need to ensure it never happens again. Personally I feel housing inflation should be tracked by a national body in the same way currency inflation is. The state should release plots of land for development if inflation goes above a certain level. If it goes beyond a higher threshold the state should directly intervene to build new property.",0,1405434207,null,0,1405434469,0,ciy0lp1,t3_2ar33n,t1_ciy0lp1,t1_cixwkql,null,1435471401,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

They replaced Gonzalez with Mike Napoli, Crawford with Gomes/Victorino. None of those are youth players. Hell, all of them are over 30. They shed contracts so they could sign these veterans on a short basis and then hope that their prospects would emerge in the next 2-3 years. Luckily, all these veterans had incredibly good seasons, outperformed their contracts and helped win the World Series. The only young player you could really argue had a meaningful impact on their season was Xander Bogarts who was called up during the playoffs at SS, a role that was not opened my Gonzalez/Crawford/Beckett leaving.

Confirmation hearings are the system they use in the US for things like approving the President's choices for Supreme Court Justices. They are a check-and-balance on a decision that has *already* been made by elected representatives. 

First the European Council votes for a nominee, in doing this they consider the results of the European Parliamentary elections. If European voters have clearly favoured a particular party grouping that grouping stands a very good chance of getting their candidate selected. 

The nominee is selected once they have reached a [qualified majority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_the_Council_of_the_European_Union#Treaty_of_Nice_.282003.E2.80.932014.2F2017.29) 

You then have ONE nominee whose name is given to the Commission to either approve or reject, they need to win an absolute majority. 

Then the European Parliament, which is made up of directly elected Members (MEPs)  has the final say in whether to grant final approval. 

The Presidency of the Commission is an influential role, but they don't have the 'head of State' role that the word 'President' implies - the EU really has a three headed Presidency made up of 

* The President of the European Commission 
* The President of the European Council 
* The High Representative

The £25m per year is a guaranteed figure for Liverpool, not performance-related, and eclipses the £23.5m-a-year deal that Manchester United have with Nike but are currently renegotiating.

Nothing new here but...

With Warrior, Liverpool will control all non-branded merchandising – products outside the usual kit range – and are free to open club stores wherever they choose.

Those guys are practically god status in Munich...calling Shaqiri second-tier because he can't break through *that* right now is like saying the same thing about Sanchez because he doesn't want to be sitting behind the Neymar/Suarez/Messi blockade. The difference is that if Shaqiri stays at Bayern, I'm absolutely certain he'll be a major first team member fairly soon, probably within 2 seasons. Ribery or Robben will start breaking down or slowing down, and he'll take his chance and begin to cement his position in the team. He's a world class talent, but he's also ambitious and is at the age where he wants to start playing a bigger role wherever he is, so we've got a chance to steal him right before he starts to reach his peak.

Ideology is a structured political beliefs system, such as socialism or neo-liberalism, and is not inherently bad.

I guess one *could* be against gay marriage on ideological grounds, but it seems a bit unlikely - it would have to be something along the lines of ""gay marriage harms children"".

Major first team member just means becoming part-time starter rather than sub right?

Flanno is a decent back-up on either side. So we still need at least 1 LB ahead of him Enrique isn't good enough - both defensively and offensively - and has had problems with injuries and brainfarts.

Dear Mr [insert MP name],

I am a voter from [insert town name] who is against the collection and storage of the online data of British citizens (or any citizen for that matter). However the proposed Data Retention and Investigatory Powers bill threatens the privacy and rights of every person in the UK. 

I support the amendment that has been tabled by Tom Watson MP, Caroline Lucas MP, and David Davis MP. This amendment brings the bill’s “sunset clause” forward to December 31, so that Parliament has a chance to debate its provisions at the end of this year.

The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers bill is very similar to the the EU-wide Data Retention Directive, which was implemented almost a decade ago and will be scrapped or reformed soon after The EU Court of Justice recently ruled blanket data retention incompatible with human rights legislation. Further to this many European countries such as Germany, never implemented the Directive as they found it violated human rights. 

I would like to stress that despite assertions from the PM, there is no need to rush through emergency legislation. This bill – especially in the light of Edward Snowden’s revelations concerning GCHQ’s online monitoring – needs proper scrutiny.

This bill would turn the UK into a nation of suspects. The government doesn’t track our letters or face-to-face meetings. Why should it assume the right to track us online?

Thank you for considering my concerns,

Yours sincerely,
[Insert Name]

This bill is more stringent again, while bulk data is stored, it can only be stored for 12 months maximum with extensions if its part of an ongoing investigation and data can only be accessed as part of an ongoing investigation by ~~request of the judiciary/home secretary not to start one and not for general access.~~

EDIT:  This last bit is wrong, according to RIPA an officer of sufficient rank as decided by parliament can authorise data retrieval if it meets certain requirements.

Mourinho tends to inspire a nearly fanatical loyalty in his players and he couldn't curb Balo's insanity. Mancini is no slouch with controversial players and he didn't come close to figuring Balotelli out.

If someone can convince Balotelli to play football every match then they're going to gain such an incredible player who will end up as one of the very best strikers in the world. If they can't though, then they're crashing a freight train loaded with fireworks and darts into the dressing room.  It's such a huge risk to take, but holy shit is the potential payoff huge.

The system of constituency MPs is disproportionately beneficial for people who are middle-class and literate - many people who grew up on council estates, who didn't do well at school, it simply wouldn't occur to them to write to their MP. They grow up knowing the world is stacked against them, and that they have no influence.

If you're middle-class and literate, you may write to your MP if it's taking months to get your mum a radiologist's appointment or if the home office give you spurious reasons for denying a visa to your foreign-born wife.

Wish you weren't getting downvoted, even if I disagree with you. Especially on a club subreddit, I think the balance should definitely be more towards upvoting good content rather than downvoting opinions. But yeah, I think full-back is the main area where we can improve our starting 11 from last year. I think we're going to need to be ruthless with the members of the squad that aren't earning their wages, and at the moment Johnson seems like the player top of that list. It's more than just about value, it's also (and this is an argument I made several times last year about selling Downing) about the squad's mentality. A player like Downing might have added to the squad in terms of personnel, but he hurt the team's determination, focus, creativity and confidence because he  exhibited none of those attributes - compare his mentality to Raheem's for example. Johnson at the moment is the player who doesn't perform often enough and is the senior player who isn't leading by example, and players notice that. 

I feel like I've gone off on a tangent, since we're talking about a left-back and I'm going on about a right-back - this is why you don't compliment me, it goes to my head - but I think it's relevant to the issue of the full-backs as a whole - it's an are we definitely need to revamp.

Wisdom going on Loan to another Premier League club would be great for him. In an ideal situation we would be bringing in another RB (dream scenario Aurier) and have him and Flanagan as our RBs with Johnson sold and Wisdom loaned.

iPlayer could continue to not encrypt (though it does do some things to prevent stream capture) and require a registration wall. iPlayer could encrypt and have no wall at all (after all, many online services do exactly this).

An iPlayer registration wall is a terrible idea - it's horribly unfriendly user wise, and it would have to result in a dramatic loss of utility (I have at least twenty iPlayer capable devices in my house, but this proposal means you'd have to cut it down - what to, five, two, one? How many streams at once?), it's very unfriendly to older users, it couldn't be done for some older devices who'd lose iPlayer entirely, and it's frankly mostly pointless - the number of people using iPlayer without a license is tiny. This would cost more in development time than it would raise. Account sharing would be totally endemic.

I personally think he'd bring a great amount to the team, he managed 16 goals from the wing last year in a new league in his first season, and last time he played a season as a striker he banged in 28 goals in 34. 

It would mean we'd have the benefit of having 2 world class strikers again, like we did last year, part of our crazy goal scoring was due to the fact we ALWAYS had one of Sturridge or Suarez fit for a game.

I think this one's got a lot of promise, captained all their youth teams and won the pint size champions league with them so he cant be half bad, but I'm always suspicious when youth players with so much apparent potential get released for nowt rather than signed up for a pro contract and sold for cash. Pleased nontheless though, he must have something about him if he's achieved so much with the Barca youth system and Pearce, who does admittedly have a very thorough knowledge about youth players from his time with the England youth setup, saw something worth paying a wage for in him.

Two centre back signings in quick succession has a tiny nasty microbe of doubt creeping in regarding Lascelles though, and the fact we haven't already told Collins to fuck off isn't helping either.

A backup / rotation midfielder would be nice now though please boss! Vaughan, Reidy, Lansbury are three good first teamers, with Osborn a prospect and Cohen generally acting as LB most of the time nowadays. Majewski's a question markas he seemed destined for the door not long ago. Loaning in someone woudn't hurt to back up those three / four.

You should only consider a chinese-brand scooter IF you're handy with the spanners and willing to do your own maintenance. They're not necessarily terrible bikes but if you don't treat them right and keep up with maintenance they won't last long.

Otherwise, look for something a little more upmarket, SYM or another Taiwanese (?) brand - these tend to have cost more than chinese bikes and as such you might notice a difference in quality. Again, be aware that you need to keep on top of regular maintenance, oil changes, etc.

Sturridge needs to step up and continue last year's form. Meanwhile Coutinho, Sterling and the incoming midfielders have to pick up the creativity. They have promise but may not be strict improvements over the current squad.

Finally, a world class CB, RB and LB. Moreno looks a decent fit for LB. Flanno should not be first option for either fullback position in a team of Liverpool's stature, at least not yet. 

TL;DR: Happy with wingers, OK with midfielders, defenders need deals quickly. ",0,1405443341,null,0,1405443628,0,ciy5924,t3_2aqx70,t1_ciy5924,t3_2aqx70,null,1434727747,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt; Dear Smeaton,
&gt;
&gt;Anas Sarwar MP has asked me to thank you for your email below regarding the government's emergency legislation on communication data and interception.
&gt;
&gt;The Government are bringing forward temporary legislation, without which the police will lose vital information used in 95% of serious &amp; organised crime investigations as well as counter terror investigations and online child abuse. That's why Mr Sarwar and his Labour colleagues are supporting the Bill today.
&gt;
&gt;Mr Sarwar is not happy with the timeframe as the Government could have come forward with proposals sooner after the April European court judgement. However, right now it is important the police and security services do not lose the capability they currently have to fight serious crime.
&gt;
&gt;Labour have secured an independent review and the start of a full and proper debate into the fundamental change the system needs. They have also secured agreement from the government that this emergency legislation will be temporary - it will expire in 2016, along with Government agreement to a major independent review of the legal framework governing surveillance (which Labour called for four months ago) so that there can be a proper public and Parliamentary debate over what the longer term legislation and arrangements should be. The Government has also agreed to a new Privacy and Civil Liberties Board.
&gt;
&gt;Mr Sarwar's colleagues in the Labour Shadow Cabinet have tabled two amendments to strengthen checks and balances even further:
&gt;
&gt;-Making the independent review of RIPA secured by Labour statutory and underpinned by the law through this legislation.
&gt;-Legislating for the Interception of Communications Commissioner to report on the working of this new Act within six months of commencement and in six-monthly intervals thereafter.
&gt;
&gt;A sunset clause is important in this Bill, as is the process of fundamental reform Labour secured through the independent review of the entire legal framework - including the powers, regulation, proportionality and oversight for data retention, access and interception to be reviewed - will result in wide-ranging reform. That isn't possible in 5 months - which would result in another rushed piece of legislation before the powers the police need expire.
&gt;
&gt;Labour's approach ensures the current capability and basic powers we need remain, while the process of much-needed reform begins.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you once again for writing to Mr Sarwar and sharing your views.
&gt;
&gt;Yours sincerely,
&gt;

Without their core guys at 100% it's very hard to play offensively. Di Maria was the glue that held it all together and once he went down it became hard to string it together. Perez and Lavezzi did an ok job but without Di Maria we missed that incisiveness. Sure we didn't look great before that, but at least we were scoring every game. And remember we scored on Belgium before Di Maria left. 

So I think it's unfair to say Argentina didn't deserve it or were lucky. They did the best with what they had. They were obviously an elite team with elite talent. But they were very exhausted. Even then they took a far superior German side to overtime and almost to penalties (which I think was their objective). I think we planned on beating them on penalties.

true,AlphaShotZ,null,null,"Bale left it late to flourish, so can PvA. Whether he'll get the chance to transition to LM/LW at 24, it'd be a risk, but who knows, it might pay off. Going on my Vitesse game knowledge: 

*Is there a chance?*
Given his ability to get up and down the wings, yes. He's relatively fast paced, is comfortable running at defenders and has a cracker of a left foot, and a decent finisher in the box, though its more of a rarity to see him make runs there [into the box], normally overlaps well with his LW.

*Is it likely?*
No. At least not if he wants to stay in England. He possesses poor dribbling technique and skill and suits the physique of a left back. As I said before, he has amazing talent - defensively he's not stable, but mainly because he makes these daft runs and fails to track back; often bailed out because the league he is playing in is substandard.

Overall, I think he's left it a tad late to transition to the wings. He doesn't possess the ability to weave his way between defenders that LWs at the highest level should have. I think he's more suited to the LWB position, which would be found in Van Gaal's NT back five.

Thousands of families and couples are being forced to live apart and it has to stop.  It has been two years next month that I have been forced to live apart from my husband, and we are in the final process of getting his greencard to come to America (also a lengthy process, but easier to meet financial requirement).  Our combined income is now roughly 3 times the income requirement, and contrary to their stated reasoning of ""lessening the financial impact of migrants on taxpayers"", they are now losing our tax revenue, and probably much more.

true,prodddddi,null,null,"Same reason they aren't in any game really. The majority of UK players attitude is total shit and any time any UK team (again, any game) has the slightest success they're called shit by UK players. We have no sense of national pride in esports at least nothing like there is in football, rugby, etc.

I'm also of the opinion that once any player is a good solid player in the UK (again, across the games I've played in) that their talent is met with an unbelieveable ego, with incredible, almost comical, arrogance. Its actually appalling the attitude some players have just because they've reached a certain standard. This also generates massive cliques within each scene that are so difficult to break down and the merrygoround of players usually occurs within them.

I also think this leads to UK teams in general being so unstable. Someones always got to be replaced or theres that ""no one here is good enough to play with me"" posturing. I've played in teams over 1.6, css, csgo dota2, battlefield series, fucking loads of games and now that I'm older looking back thats been the constant theme.

I've mainly been in all UK teams but I've played in EU teams as well, protugese/spanish/irish css teams, eu mix dota teams or whatever. Don't get me wrong the same problem exists in other countries but the UK is an undeniable cesspit for it across the board.

&gt;Many thanks for your email about the Bill which is going through parliament today.
 
&gt;Probably like you, I have read and listened to the arguments on both sides and I am not convinced that the measures are the threat to democracy which is being claimed.
 
&gt;The European Court of Justice ruled that the retention of data has insufficient basis in law and therefore that the relevant companies should not keep data for 12 months. The Bill seeks to provide that basis so those companies can continue to keep data - only for 12 months - which is the practise that has prevailed for many years until the ECJ ruling.
 
&gt;The Bill, therefore, simply perpetuates the existing situation and does not extend powers.
 
&gt;The data, as you probably know, is communications between mobile phones, for instance, but not the content of those communications. Such data retention has been used in prosecuting some of the notorious grooming cases in recent years such as those in Oxford, Derby and Rochdale. The first of these cases concerned individuals from the Bradford-Keighley area where I grew up until the age of 18 so this is an issue pretty close to my heart.
 
&gt;I realise, of course, that we are on the opposite sides of this argument. However, it is quite true that the government is rushing this through with absurd haste. The problem here is that governments are now able to timetable legislation in the House of Commons. That is why I voted consistently against timetabling when it was introduced. I would vote now to get rid of timetabling if that were on offer, but sadly that damage was done some time ago.

&gt;Yours sincerely,
 
&gt;John Cryer

My main argument to him was that the bill deserved far more scrutiny than being squeezed through in the space of a day, so I'm glad that he's at least taken an interest (and I'll check tomorrow to see whether he's actually turned up to debate it today).",0,1405445869,null,0,false,0,ciy6nxs,t3_2arjye,t1_ciy6nxs,t3_2arjye,null,1434728374,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

And then on Twitter it's ""LFC are delighted to annouce the signing of.."" &gt; emphasis is on the announcement and the signing bit is almost passive, like this is just a thing that *happened*, not something one or the other party *did*.

Maybe I'm totally alone on this, but I find it interesting that there isn't a more unified tone coming from the club. Maybe they're just trying to cover all their bases, but especially given the Suarez departure I'm a bit surprised to see that the linguistic emphasis isn't *all* on ""Liverpool goes out and gets a great player"". To be clear: I'm not complaining, I'm just a bit surprised. I'd expect something a bit more unified from such a big club, but we do this every time.

That said, I'm delighted with the signing. I never watch the scouting videos until it's official, but I just watched one, and wow.

The Doctor claimed he was 900 when Rose asked him his age, add a few years until we get to the God Complex. When that episode ends, Eleven begins his farewell tour of roughly 200 years that ends in the season finale when he goes to face his death. This brings him to 1100 or so years old. Fast forward to the Snowmen, where we learn that Eleven has been grieving Amy and Rory for a while, I don't remember how long, someone else may though. Then we come to Trenzalore where the Doctor defends the tiny town of Christmas for roughly 900 years. 

This gives us over 2000 as his current age, but he's obviously way older than that as I believe Seven claimed he was 900 something at some point, and the War Doctor had to have lived for a very long time to have aged from where we saw him at the end of Night of the Doctor to where we saw him at the end of the Time War.

Part of the problem is housing benefit, effectively subisdising London for a lot of people. It's like rent controls, but in reverse. But in turn it keeps people renting, and then in turn keeps rents and house prices high.

true,Lossenhyando,null,null,"I got this reply from Stephen Lloyd (Lib Dem) in Eastbourne, It's a template but it's honest about it at least

""Dear friend,
 
Many thanks for your email. Apologies for not being able to send a personal reply, but I felt it important that I was able to respond to you, and the other constituents who have raised concerns around this Bill, as quickly as possible. I will be supporting this Bill, though you do raise some very important questions which I would like to respond to in detail.
 
As a Liberal, I care profoundly about civil liberties, privacy, and the need to limit abusive state surveillance. The ‘slippery slope’ concept is something I totally buy into when it comes to civil liberties.

However, I also know that there is a need for the police and intelligence agencies to have the tools to do the job we give them - as long as they are carefully controlled, appropriately used, and proportionate to the threat faced.

Those concerns are key - and I have often been incensed at the way governments, whether Labour or Tory, have used threats for terrorism or anything else as a reason to chip away at our individual freedoms. We must not and will not allow this.

There is an issue, though, which we have to deal with now. The European Court of Justice threw out the European Data Retention Directive, which underpins all collection of communications data in this country. I sympathise with the reasons, but we must acknowledge that it causes real problems - we do need to have some way to keep some communications data, even if under very careful control.

Some people would love to use this to bring back the awful, previous Communications Data Bill - known as the Snooper’s Charter – that, I am pleased to say, the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg vetoed last year. A number of Conservatives pushed it and Labour tried something similar themselves. We will not allow this to happen. We’ve blocked it once in the Coalition, and we will continue to do so.
 
The proposed legislation in front of us today just allows the agencies to continue with their current abilities, and I can assure you of that, irrespective of some lobby groups noises off. I’ve also had the chance to speak to Nick Clegg about this and have been clear. We must keep our country and citizens safe, but not by allowing the erosion of our key civil liberties and increasing unchecked intrusion into our lives.

We need legislation to allow communications data to be available, but not to store more than is already allowed. Frankly, my personal view is that in this post-Snowden world we need to move towards keeping less, and finding better and more proportionate ways to do so. I actually believe we need to completely rewrite the law in this area, but that cannot be done quickly. We have to get it right, which will take a lot of work from many experts. We’ve already started that off - our ‘Digital Bill of Rights’ motion calls for a commission of experts to review all state surveillance and information from the Snowden revelations - that takes time. The Deputy Prime Minister has already started this work with the Royal United Services Institute, but they need to finish that work.

So I think it is right to agree to a stop-gap. A piece of legislation that can be passed quickly, but crucially will automatically expire at the end of 2016, giving time to write something better, and the certainty of knowing it will not just become entrenched.

And in this stop-gap legislation, we should agree to no more than was previously allowed. We’ve managed better than that - we’ve also negotiated and won a package of pro-civil liberties measures to go with it:
 
* The Bill includes a termination clause that ensures the legislation falls at the end of 2016 and the next government is forced to look again at these powers.
* Between now and 2016 we will hold a full review of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, to make recommendations for how it could be reformed and updated.
* We will appoint a senior diplomat to lead discussion with the American government and the internet companies to establish a new international agreement for sharing data between legal jurisdictions.
* We will establish a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board on the American model, to ensure that civil liberties are properly considered in the formulation of government policy on counter-terrorism. This will be based on David Anderson's existing role as the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation.
* Further reform of the Intelligence and Security Committee, so that in future the Chair must be drawn from the Opposition parties.
* We will restrict the number of public bodies that are able to approach phone and internet companies and ask for communications data. Some bodies will lose their powers to access data altogether while local authorities will be required to go through a single central authority who will make the request on their behalf.
* Finally, we will publish annual transparency reports, making more information publicly available than ever before on the way that surveillance powers operate.

I don’t claim that this is a perfect long-term solution, but I also don’t think anyone could write down, right now, what would be perfect and the security challenges we are facing today are serious; there’s no two ways about it. What we are voting on is a heck of a lot better than anything either the Tories or Labour would have done on their own. That may sounds subjective, but look what their record has been in this area compared to us! When it comes to protecting civil liberties I profoundly believe it’s a good thing that the Lib Dems are in Government.

All the best,

Stephen

I've worked in three schools - I have yet to meet a teacher who supported Gove. Why would that be? I noted at least one teacher in each school leaving due, in part, to their discontent with such radical, idealogical changes to curriculum, pay and pensions.

The reforms were pushed through because of his individual, unchanging, rigid ideological viewpoint - no consultation with teachers - thus widespread discontent and striking. 

A great many of his policies were significantly under-thought, unsubstantiated or impractical and thus were dropped; unfortunately many passed. And we are left with a legacy that the average Joe believes has 'toughened up teaching' because that's what the headlines say. Hilarious.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"Yes he has missed a lot of chances, but the problem you aren't recognizing with Torres is that its bigger than him missing chances. For strikers, they get confidence by scoring. That feeling needs to stay with a striker for him to keep scoring goals. But for strikers to score goals, they need to miss some goals too. In fact they need to miss a LOT of goals to start scoring. 

With Torres, he isn't getting enough chances to miss chances. The reason behind him not getting chances could be several, including the one I mentioned earlier about his movement being poor. He doesn't stop his runs in the box, he doesn't try and break off-side traps anymore. Overall just concentrates more on defensive retention and isn't the type of striker who possesses the ability to ALSO contribute to attack at the same time, especially at this stage of his career. So, when he doesn't get enough chances or enough opportunities to miss, the focus on his misses increases ten fold. We end up seeing that he has missed 9/10 chances, even though those 10 chances may have occurred over a course of 10 or 20 games.

Emegency medical insurnce is only £110 per year? hardly a problem given they pay almost £10 000 for uni.

I see your point, given the amount of money you bring to the country as a student, maybe medical care should be included, but truth be told, most people will avid paying their medicals bills if possible, so maybe a better system should be in place. (and you should be clearly notified of it also.

It's so bad I just automatically assumed it only happened with generous American companies and never actually thought about it until I read your post!

The one place I know you can get free samples is the Lush in Belfast. They used to give them out left, right and centre there, but now you really have to ask for them which is a bit frustrating.

The last couple of times I've been in there though the staff have been appalling as they've appeared to just have hired in bulk or something.

I don't use a lot of the bigger cosmetic counters in the like of Debenhams or House of Fraser because of price or that they test on animals, but I can tell you the sweetest people work on the Illamasqua counter in Belfast. I'd say they would be the best people to weasel a free sample out of.

Also, a lovely woman at the Boots counter in Craigavon said that she'd be happy to give me a sample of their Colour Match foundation to try for a while if I went out and bought a little tub to put it in. I didn't take her up on it though, because both her, my mother and I unanimously agreed that their lightest shade was far too dark on me so there was no point.

So the best tactic from reading other posts and my own experience is that you should ask for samples and also bring tiny little tubs with you just in case they use this as an excuse! A bit frustrating that you have to go that far, but I reckon that if they do get any sachets of make-up in, they just dish them out to their friends and family instead of customers.",0,1405448625,null,0,false,0,ciy89kh,t3_29rn8n,t1_ciy89kh,t3_29rn8n,null,1434729050,1,false,MakeUpAddictionUK,t5_319vn,1

Sanchez to Arsenal is the perfect example. They have been steady, whereas we just saw a huge spike of success. 

the ironic thing is that ATM, we are buying/developing young players, so HOPEFULLY we won't even need to attract big names. Hopefully the only big names we'll need to sign are defenders and maybe a striker or two if Spurs is linked. Just to piss them off. When you look at our ""prospects"" above the half, we have:

-Ibe

-Markovic

-Teixiera

-Wilson

-Suso

-Alberto

Thats not including Coutinho and Sterling who are currently playing amazing. Sanchez would have been nice this season. REALLY nice. but ideally we will see our young players begin regularly adding to the goal tally. If we can stay in CL this season without suarez, it will be a HUGE testament to the talent of our youth and the guidance of Brendan Rodgers.

And he's also decent at holding possession, it's just the final ball or shot that I think is lacking. And when you hold possession with players like Hazard and Schurrle around, something can happen out of nothing, even if you've just killed off a counterattack by slowing play down, like Willian did so often last year. Whereas if you're only really close to Torres or Oscar that's much less likely.

And you're right, Schurrle probably wasn't as good last year as he has been in the World Cup, but I also wasn't at all surprised to see him playing how he was. He's always looked exciting for Chelsea, but I think his end product has just been a bit better and that's what people notice.

----

Welcome back for Part 2 ! 


Today we'll look into the numbers and variables displayed yesterday, and make sense of them regarding the CBA. 

If you missed the first one, it's right here. A quick reminder : 

---

**Principle**

---

The basic idea is to look at **how salaries within each NBA team would look like if players were paid based on their performances for the season** (through Win Shares), and from that make observations of the effects of the current CBA and add to the discussion about what


[Win Shares](http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html) is an advanced stat that measures a player's contribution to it's team results. 
Since the **sum of each player's Win Shares within a team is roughly the same to the actual wins of the team**. According to its creator *""since the 1962-63 season, the average absolute error is 2.74 wins""*, on the data this year is [at 3.23 wins](http://i.imgur.com/OCS1oRD.png) compared to [last year's 2.53](http://i.imgur.com/IFQEt1I.png) wins.

It's a good way to measure each player's value to the team, and to compare it to each player's salary, since they are **both distributed across a roster which makes it easy and relevant to take a look at those two variables.** 

It's important to understand that the adjusted salaries ***do not*** correspond to what a player is worth in the open market, but what he is worth ***to his team***. 

---
**Analysis**

---

Yesterday we looked at the team-by-team situation , as well as players at the extremes. This last segment will look at league-wide comparisons for both teams and players to try make sense of the data. 

---

***Population***

First a quick look at how the population is composed. There are 478 players (including 8 wiaved players twice in the database) on 32 teams. [**The number of players used by teams this past season**](http://i.imgur.com/t2oE3kJ.png) goes from 14 for the Nets to 21 for the Sixers.

Regarding players, [**the age distribution**](http://i.imgur.com/iceoo2F.png) means that age-based analysis will focus on the 20-34 group (over 10, and allows to avoid the Kobe anomaly at 35). [**The position distribution**](http://i.imgur.com/mEmPj9P.png) is fairly well spread out while [**the salary distribution**](http://i.imgur.com/SWra8b7.png) is as expected small-contracts heavy : 

- About a quarter (24.7%) of NBA players made less than a million dollars in 2013-14

- About half (47.1%) of the league made between $1M and $5M

- And the remaining quarter (28.2%) made more than $5M in 2013-14

A look at **[the player-salary distribution](http://i.imgur.com/kHO5nLm.png)** confirms that both Salary and Win-Shares are concentrated at the top: 

- The Top 10% of players concentrate nearly 40% of both salary and WS

- The median split is 85-15

- The Top 30% of players makes more than 70% of WS and salary. 

So just how much is this salary disparity affecting the results of calcuting salary by the share of Win...shares ? 

---

***Plots***


Let's start by [**putting both variables in a scatter plot**](http://i.imgur.com/uvytBik.png). For comprehension:

- The more to the **top** you are, the **more you contributed** to your team

- The more to the **right** you are, the **more money you took** from your team

- If you are **over** the grey diagonal, you should make **more** money

- If you are **under** the grey diagonal, you should make **less** money

- If you are in negatives, you just suck.


Of course with all players it's just a big mesh of points. The main attribute is the high number of low-paid and low-contributing players, which is, once again, completletely expected: there's only 12 roster spots by team. 

*Sidenote: I wanted to make an interactive version of this, where you can filter out by position, team, age and all, but I can't code for shit and from the online stuff, infogr.am is the closest to it but it's impossible to configure properly*

---

***Rookies***

If we trim down to just players on rookie contracts, **[the plot shows something more interesting](http://i.imgur.com/ldI7jQv.png)**. Due to the salary scale on rookie contracts, only two players made more than 10% of the team's payroll: John Wall (11.5%) and Derrick Favors (10.5%).

As a result, apart from a lot of rookies not contibuting while being equally (not) paid, most rookies are underpaid, and the best of them considerably so (as seen yesterday). **The few rookies to be significatively overpaid are 5 of the Top 6 of last year's draft** : Bennett and Oladipo, as well as Porter, Len and Nerlens Noel (circled) 

---

***Veterans***

If we isolate veterans (players in their 30ies), [**we see basically the opposite**](http://i.imgur.com/invOT8d.png): very few veterans can outplay their salary. Among the few: Bridman, Dunleavy, Korver. Dirk deserves an honorable mention, and he'll have no problem outperforming his new contract. 

*Sidekobe note: All the plots stop at 35% so that they are more easily readable, that leaves out Kobe and his 40.1% of the Lakers' payroll.*

---

***Most efficients***

Last sub-group: **[the one for players with a WS/48 over .125](http://i.imgur.com/bzhXMDE.png)**. Basically all the players with a high WS% bar the ones on terrible teams : Thad Young, Favors, Meeks, Afflalo, Monroe, Sessions, Bass and Henry Sims among the Top 40. 

We've got about 5 groups: 

- The Elite 4: *Durant, Love, LeBron and Melo*

- The underpaid rooks: *Drummond and Davis leading the way*

- Players on bargain non-rookie contracts: *Lowry, Curry, Dragic, Noah, Robin Lopez, Jordan Hill, McRoberts*

- Those who are living up to their contracts: *Griffin, Harden, Big Al, DeAndre Jordan, Ty Lawson, DeRozan*

- Those who missed time  through injuries: *Westbrook, Marc Gasol, Horford, Chris Paul, Brook Lopez, Bogut, Splitter*



**Group based results**

---

Moving on to indivdual-based observations to group-based ones: just how signifcant are salary, age and position regarding how much a player should make ? 

Comparing **[Win Shares and Salary distribution based on salary group](http://i.imgur.com/RIuu8Qb.png)** confirms that small contracts and underpaid while big contracts, especially the $10-15M, are overpaid. Meanwhile, mid-sized contracts are living up to their valuation. 

If we look at **[the average difference between Adjusted and Actual Salary by position](http://i.imgur.com/6LxVH1f.png)**, we see that centers and shooting guards (mostly Kobe thought) are overpaid, with a big guy earning on average over $5M more than he should this season.  
Small Forwards are appropriately paid while Ppint Guards and Power Forwards, often considered to be the deepest positions, were on average underpaid by $4M this season. 

And finally, **the most telling graph** of all,**[ the average difference between Adjusted and Actual Salary by age](http://i.imgur.com/qpz2OZJ.png)**. 
It basically reads itself:

- *Players between 20 and 24*, on rookie scaled or minimum contracts, are **greatly underpaid**. Notice the peak in under-valuation at age 23 (led by Wall, Cousins, George...), usually the last year before big extensions start to kick in at age 24 (Griffin, Harden, Ibaka, Evans, DeRozan) and 25 (Curry, Teague...)

- *Players between 25 and 28*, honoring well their first big contract and  **matching on the court the expectations of their salary**. 

- *Players between 29 and 34*, who are living off their past performances and **earning to much money**. The overpay is reduced for 33 and 34 years olds who are usually on their second post-prime contracts and thus more appropriately paid. 

---

**Team based results**

There are two things to look at here on a franchise level:

- [**Which teams are the most and least egalitarian when it comes to paying their players ?**](http://i.imgur.com/UWtoHHX.png) 

The most egalitarian team in the league is Toronto, the least is the Lakers. Unsurprinsgly it reads like such: superstar-less teams in the upper half, superstar-full teams in the lower half. 

- **[Which teams are paying their players to closest amount to their actual performances ?](http://i.imgur.com/1TkOZfj.png)** 

The answer is: the Clippers, who are amusingly the complete opposite of the Lakers.

At the bottom we find next to the Lakers injury-riden teams (Nets, Bulls) and tankers (Sixers, Bucks, Kings, Celtics, Magic...)

While at the top Utah is the only Top 12 team not to make the playoffs


---
**Data Sharing**

---

You can browse and download the Excel files if you want to play with them:

Last year's data is still available:

Overall nothing ground-breaking, just confirmations of established notions around the NBA: rookies are getting shafted in favor of veterans: the CBA at work !

I've followed his career since making Partizan debut, talent and potential obvious from the point of breaking into the first team

Top European sides were monitoring him back then, most of those impressed by his great ability though some concerns re ""frail"" physique

In terms of potential there's no doubt in my mind that Markovic is among the top 3-5 greatest talents in European football

Main characteristics: great ability on the ball (close control, touch), explosive/very quick in one vs one situations, intelligent

Transfer fee may seem high but if player develops according to expectations/potential, he could (should) be worth x2 in 18-24 months

relatively small population of players (kind of guessing but i'd say dota is not as popular in pc gaming in the uk compared to other countries, take your reason to be whatever you want, but I don't think the dota playing population in the uk is huge)

then a small percentage of players with the necessary skill to compete at the top level (as there would be anywhere else)

then only a proportion of those players with the necessary attitude / ambitions to compete at the top level. and then they've got to be stable, not have issues, and actually be able to dedicate the time 

player attitude may incidentally be poor (as proddi said) but I think this is more just chance than anything.

i think the players do actually exist to do really well but it remains to be seen if it will happen

afterthought: what i kind of wanted to say is that i think there are at least enough ""good"" players to make a quality team but you actually need a lot of good players to make such a team, because you can't just put 5 players of the right skill together and guarantee that all the criteria will fit, motivation etc. so the likelihood that we see the ideal team pop up is low unless extra talent comes up, or given time.",0,1405451111,null,0,1405468619,0,ciy9pfp,t3_2aryr0,t1_ciy9pfp,t3_2aryr0,null,1434729984,7,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,7

&gt;__Bad Manners__ are an [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) [ska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska) [band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble) led by frontman [Buster Bloodvessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Bloodvessel). Early appearances included *[Top of The Pops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_The_Pops)* and the live [film documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_documentary), *[Dance Craze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Craze)*. 

&gt;They were at their most popular during the early 1980s, during a period when other ska revival bands such as [Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madness_(band\)), [The Specials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials) and [The Selecter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selecter) filled the [charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart). Bad Manners spent 111 weeks in the [UK Singles Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart) between 1980 and 1983,  and they also achieved chart success with their first four studio albums with *[Gosh It's... Bad Manners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosh_It%27s..._Bad_Manners)*, *[Loonee Tunes!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loonee_Tunes!)* and *[Ska 'n' B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska_%27n%27_B)* being their biggest hits.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;I don't think its fair to target him for decisions that were probably the best decisions he could make given the circumstances.

He's certainly constrained by his budget, by his political capital, and by the general friction and difficulty in getting things done in a government machine that has ""the engine of a lawnmower and the brakes of a Rolls-Royce"". And he can't be the complete idiot he's often portrayed as, given that he hasn't the family background and connections enjoyed by most ministers.

But he's made too many mistakes. He's disregarded advice, unable to distinguish honest criticism from vested interest. He thinks that the solution that worked for him personally can and should be extended to all UK schools. He thinks that a market-led parent-centric approach is feasible. He and his advisers are unable to estimate costs: his free schools are 3x over budget. He's presided over uneven wasteful provision.

Above all he's tried to do too much too quickly on too small a budget, which has caused him to fail on all counts.

Commute, however should be about £60pm for an unlimited bus pass.

My maths then says it'll be ~£350pm discretionary income without the loan.

I was originally looking to increase the term of the loan to maybe 5 years, drop the minimum payment to £100pm. Gives me more discretionary income, and allows me to save to pay off the debt in larger chunks. Doing this, and putting the £2k bonus into the loan, would reduce the actual time to completion of the loan to roughly 2.5yr (based on Natwest representative 11.9% APR).

How do those assumptions sound?
