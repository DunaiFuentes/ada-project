From that point of view, it seems to me that the Doctor often serves as the catalyst that brings violence to a head (so it can be resolved) when he shows up in the middle of a battle or an ongoing crime etc. Perhaps part of his ""otherness"" is being *drawn* to violent or incipiently violent situations to which he only allows himself to respond with his intelligence (for the most part) because of his sometimes genocidal past.  One of the reasons he needs a companion with him is that intelligence isn't always sufficient: sometimes you also need insight, which extreme otherness might prevent you from obtaining.  Insight involves emotion and empathy more than cold logic and swift calculation.  Part of the Doctor's make up seems to be an unpredictability in his access to empathy (""She's my carer; she cares so I don't have to"").  That's not a fault so much as it's a characteristic of his ""otherness"" to just about everybody else.  His relationship and reactions to violence are the crux of many of his adventures.

He is pardoning Sterling's dip in production this season, he is pardoning the form of the squad based on injuries, and he is pardoning his own ability to influence what players were brought into the club.

Mind my words, as they might sound a little cliche, but the point is accurate. This club and more importantly the squad do not need excuses given to them at the moment.

They need high expectations that they can rise to. Brad Jones taking the starting goal position does not reek of high standards.

At this point, I'm digressing, but thank you if you are still reading. Last point, I think Rodgers is trolling the board and ownership at this point. 

Perhaps there is more symbolism to this current squad than might meet the eye. Mignolet was pushed for by the club as because he had 1)achieved some success in the Pl 2) was young, and 3) on lower wages than Reina. 

Rodgers benching Migns is his way of sending a message to the board that this is what happens when you don't listen to his desires. You end up without a real goalkeeper competition and the performance level of the keeper you brought in dips. 

TL;DR - I'm starting to think that derivative of supporters' current angst that is being directed at Rodgers is indicative of the board not seeing eye to eye with Rodgers. He is trolling them with the squad selections, making his case for why he should have control over transfer selections.

Funny because when you see schoolchildren in London walking in groups outside they look so orderly and well behaved in their lines and uniforms.... Its all a damn front! Get them inside and I nearly got knocked over several times by kids running into me, tripping me and screaming so damn loud inside, even the art museums like they had been drinking espresso all day! If we ever did that here in the USA on a museum trip when I was growing up we would have been brought right to the bus to sit the rest of the day, maybe even led by an ear..... and would have gotten worse at home. I think that surprised me.... I have wondered if that was typical or not. I still remember the chaperones being so nonchalant and relaxed about it and really envied that about them. 

Maybe a more lax, permissive approach to parenting in UK but in reality more structured?

Other than that I noticed kids were more polite and proper overall in the UK. Manners are still taught and expected it seemed for the most part. Not that they aren't in the USA but, well, can be greatly lacking at times. 

Well versed on world news, events and geography, where here in USA we seem to be more narrow viewing. Taught languages and expected to know more than just English. They also have more likely been to several countries generally and witnessed lots more history and cultures which does seem to mature a person. So many in the USA never even get a passport which must seem really strange to anyone from the UK.

Definitely more exposure to the all the arts and world history in UK in general- its everywhere. LOVED that concerts were so much cheaper and also so many more shows to choose from and so affordable. Will be great when the tubes run later and we don't have to rush from a venue in Brixton to catch a train home though! I think I saw Seether and 3 Doors Down for 13 quid.... and the beer is way more affordable at concerts too!! Can't touch that here in USA. 

English use more descriptive words like ""brilliant"" and ""fab"" and the like. Surprised me the expression they used when I first landed there, almost shocking at first but grew to like it. 

They definitely don't talk to others like many in USA will. No striking up random convos on the tube or trains at all. 

And they still iron their sheets over there and starch the crap out of clothes!! Which brings me to for the most part, in UK the kids dress neater even in the rebellious teen years. Its more of an orderly, neat rebellion (almost passive aggressive) compared to the USA teens wide open no holds barred rebellion at times. 

Their education system is different with A levels, forms, etc. They really start to separate the achievers earlier on, and definitely still have that whole class thing, status, etc.

false,SteveMcQwark,canada,Ontario,"Technically it took effect before the Canadian Parliament consented to it. The Canadian *Succession to the Throne Act 1937* received royal assent in the name of King George VI, not Edward VIII, because the British Act came into effect while the Canadian Parliament wasn't sitting. This was okay because British legislation is automatically effective in changing succession, and dominion consent was only required by convention. Since political support for the abdication existed in Canada, as later proved by the passage of the *Succession to the Throne Act 1937*, passing the Abdication Act before Canada consented to it was considered sufficiently in the spirit of the convention set out in the Statute of Westminster to not create any problems, and thus it made sense not to wait for the Canadian Parliament to sit in order to resolve the crisis.

Despite this, in order to make absolutely certain that the Act would be effective, the Canadian Government gave its consent under section 4 of the Statute of Westminster for the British Act to apply as part of the law of Canada, and this was declared in the preamble of the British Act. According to WPM Kennedy, a contemporary expert in Canadian constitutional law and author of what is widely considered the definitive book on the subject, this invocation of section 4 was unnecessary and of no effect, since the provisions of the Act did not touch in any way on the law of *Canada*, instead dealing only with the shared institution of the Crown. However, because section 4 was invoked in 1936 and has since been repealed, there are some who claim that the procedure of having the UK Parliament effect the changes and the Parliament of Canada merely consenting to them as a matter of convention no longer applies. This has led to a (unfounded in my view and that of many prominent constitutional scholars) legal challenge against the effectiveness of the recent change to succession in relation to Canada, since contrary to other Realms which tried to effect the changes themselves as part of their constitutions, Canada simply followed the procedure set out in the Statute of Westminster.

Anyways, if the Queen *were* to abdicate for whatever reason, it would be nice if she held off until *after* the legal challenge has made its way through the courts. Depending on the outcome, the Canadian part in effecting the abdication could either be trivial or rather complex, potentially requiring a constitutional amendment with unanimous consent from the provinces, though I consider that outcome unlikely.",0,1418879134,null,0,1418879885,0,cmybuh1,t3_2pkqdg,t1_cmybuh1,t1_cmxq3g2,null,1425341868,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

And if a regency were to come about in the UK, only New Zealand (afaik) has a provision for the regency to apply to them. The premise was that, in a pinch, governors-general can act as regents, so only the UK needs anything automatic. If the need for a more permanent solution should arise, the thinking was, the other Realms could deal with it then. Clearly, it would be unsatisfactory for there to be separate regencies in each of the Realms for an extended period of time though, and since enacting such things can be tricky in Canada and Australia due to their federal constitutions, effecting a singular regency for all the realms could turn out to be a bit of a nightmare in itself.",0,1418882747,null,0,false,0,cmyd9e5,t3_2pkqdg,t1_cmyd9e5,t1_cmxzxze,null,1425341208,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

That's exactly what I do, and I had recruitment agents constantly asking me to go to interviews all around the country. If you're prepared to live anywhere, you will find work.

Contracting, huh? That's difficult. There used to be a visa called a ""Tier 1"" for highly skilled immigrants. Someone like you (and me) could have got this visa a few years ago. https://www.gov.uk/tier-1-general/overview. This visa allows you to come to the UK and find work on your own terms. I married a UK national, so I entered via a family visa.

Contracting is an interesting grey area. When you contract, you are working fulltime for a company who then contracts you out to another company. 

Options:

(a) Your own company

**Anyone** can create a company in the UK and become the director of that company. Your company then pays you a salary as the director, and you can then contract yourself out to another company to do work as a software engineer. You handle all your own taxes and insurance. But, you can't employee yourself if you don't have the right to work in the UK!

It's possible that this company could pay a foreign national for services. For example, I live and work in the UK, but I am allowed to visit another country in order to carry out my work.  Maybe you can form a US company, and then contract/""outsource"" yourself out to a British company. 

At this point, my knowledge of these loopholes is non-existent. You can try asking on the various contractor forums that exist. e.g. http://www.contractoruk.com/

https://www.gov.uk/new-employee-coming-to-work-from-abroad

(b) Work for an umbrella/consultancy company

This is when a third party employs you as a consultant, they handle your finances, and pay you the remainder after they take their cut. This is pretty normal and you *might* be able to get sponsorship of a Tier 2 visa through such an arrangement.

In an accept situation, a sense-check will be completed by a real person and the case will be approved by the lender unless something obvious is wrong. Let's say, for the sake of argument, 20-50% of applications have this outcome.

In a refer situation (for example, not much data on credit scoring, or question marks over past addresses, or any number of outcomes), a manual credit check will be performed, and further checks completed, and a decision will be given based on a ""balanced scorecard"" lending approach.

In a decline situation (CCJs, defaults, major issues), it is unlikely the bank will check further unless the decision is appealed by the applicant.

Get a load of you. You replied to my first comment with a throw away comment and you accuse me of not engaging with debate. Get off your high horse for a minute and look at the accusations you are leveling at the Government. Its almost like you're some sort of Labour spin machine regurgitating the party line when you seem to have little to no knowledge of the situation at all.

&gt;The tories are privatising it. billions of pounds spent for private services.

Its is the contracts that are being openly tendered to the private sector in a fair process. The word *'privatisation*' in government terms means, and you well know this I suspect:

*""the process of transferring ownership of a business, enterprise, agency, public service, or public property from the public sector (a government) to the private sector""*

There has been no selling off of the NHS so stop your noise please. It's painfully ignorant of reality. The contracts have been tendered to private sector where they have bid and won against the NHS departments providing better value for money to the tax payer. Something we all want expect for left wing loonatics for whom money is no object in their idealistic fantasies.

Under this government private firms have taken on an extra 1% of NHS contracts. 1%!?!?! That is now 6%. When Labour started the process of tendering contracts they took this figure from 0% to 5%. None of their supporters were outraged then, this is a vogue thing now because that slimy toad Ed Milliband is weaponsing the NHS and conning idiots like you into thinking the Coalition are doing something they are not. But when the Coalition do but a fraction of that they are evil capitalists selling off *""billions of pounds of the NHS""* with the hope of taking us to an USA style insurance system. Do you honestly think the UK electorate would allow any Government to get away with that. It would be hilarious if you actually believed that.

Privitastion of the NHS is fucking nonsense and you well know it, if you don't know it then you're too ignorant to be having this debate.",0,1418892343,null,0,false,0,cmyfvqk,t3_2pkal4,t1_cmyfvqk,t1_cmyctfb,null,1425339830,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The original letter points out that it is not brand's message that gets him barred from places, but the fact he wants to shout and make a scene rather than make an appointment and have a discussion with the manager like the rest of us mere mortals. The original letter says that if a 'rabid capitalist' wanted to do the same thing then they too would be detained by security.

Then this chap says, 'What if someone came without an appointment looking to invest £100m?', and treats it like a slam dunk argument proving that security detained Brand because of his message. But a moment's thought suggests this argument doesn't hang together in the slightest; investing £100m and shouting at punchclock security guards aren't remotely the same thing

The rest of the article makes similar slips of logic; in the 'Return of the Jedi' section, Return of the Jedi is used as an example of corrupt accounting in Hollywood - accounting which Brand has provably benefitted from. But this letter argues that mentioning Return of the Jedi is tantamount to believing Brand personally benefitted from Return of the Jedi, which is obviously nonsense. Similarly the 'personal space' argument is specious; getting in someone's personal space means you want to fight them or screw them, and anyone without an agenda to push knows that.

Incidentally, this is why Brand (and his acolytes in my particular) annoys me so much; this sort of thing is not a fair representation of the left's ability to produce high-quality argumentation, but I understand completely why nobody will listen to us if the moment we have a platform we waste it trying to defend Hollywood accounting of all things.",0,1418894662,null,0,false,0,cmygdfv,t3_2po0yi,t1_cmygdfv,t3_2po0yi,null,1425339601,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The problem is not with the club! The problem is with the FA that sells the rights for BILLIONS of dollars, so only those that purchase the batch of games can show them (with limitations! for example, even in England only handful of games are shown on Saturday, in order to stimulate people going to matches), hence if you want Chelsea tv to show all live games- they need to pay hundreds of millions.

The loan is supposed to cover tuition and ""maintenance"" - your rent, food, bills etc. In practice the maintenance part of the loan is around £3000 a year, which *just* covers rent and bills for most people. You'd need something to supplement it; a part time job or money from parents. But as your rent is paid through your own loan, the burden on Mum and Dad is probably less than you're currently anticipating.

If you leave the UK you still have to pay back your loan. There are certain rules on how much you have to pay back - if I recall correctly (I haven't investigated this much as I don't plan to move away), you can either give them proof of income in which case they ask for the same amount they would have had you been in the UK, or you can not provide proof in which case they ask for some sort of ""standard rate"" which depending on your circumstances may be more or less than you would normally pay.

You do have to pay it back, unless you never intend to return to the UK (bad move - what if an employer asks you to do a secondment here? ;) )

Your guess is roughly right - the cost to the employee is effectively 20% of the benefit (if they're a basic rate taxpayer) - the total deemed value of the benefit is added to their taxable income and taxed as normal.

Unfortunately coding changes are generally retrospective, so your girlfriend may get a demand for tax next tax year as the system catches up. The best she can do is notify HMRC as soon as the benefit arises (she can call them), and hope their administration works properly.

An interesting and often missed point about private health insurance is that the benefit is a simple proportion of the total cost to the employer. For example, if cover for ten employees costs £10,000 PA, the deemed benefit to everybody is £1,000 PA each.

A tax break would help, but frankly it's a mature province and the remaining prospects are increasingly marginal.

I think this is part of the story everyone's ignoring.  The all the ""Saudis vs shale"" bullshit spewed out by the economist, it's expensive legacy production in Alaska, North Sea, Sibera and a number of other places which is really going to be hurting, and which might disappear from global markets relatively quickly.

The north sea needs something like $150 a barrel to pay for refurbishment, decomissioning and the big expensive projects sucking really poor quality thick oil out of the ground.

I'll let her know to call HMRC. She's paid tomorrow so I guess the earliest this will kick-in is her January pay anyway.

All media sources seem to be reporting this with inaccurate headlines.  The Guardian article quotes the court directly (my emphasis):

&gt;In its decision, the court said: “While no general principle of EU law prohibits, in itself, discrimination on grounds of obesity, that condition falls within the concept of ‘disability’ where, **under particular conditions,** it hinders the full and effective participation of the person concerned in professional life on an equal basis with other workers.

*Dear Joe*

*Thank you very much for taking the time to contact me in relation to the NHS, I appreciate you doing so.*

*It is concerning that an agreement has not been reached in relation to NHS pay. Staff in the NHS do a hugely important job and deserve to be treated fairly. It is thereforce extremely important that both ministers and the unions take a sensible approach to negotiations to ensure that staff are not adversely affect for any longer than necessary.*

*Prifate Finance Initiatives (PFI) were first introduced by the last conservative Government and saw a considerable expansion under the previous Labour Government. Labour strongly opposed PFI whilst in opposition but introduced far more projects via this form of funding than had been done before.*

*The impact of PFI has been less than convincing and has been hugely controversial since its introduction in the early 1990‘s. This form of financing is still firmly supported by Labour. I do support the NHS remaining a public body, as my voting record shows, and will continue to support positive reforms that improve and support essential front line services.*

*I have always been a keen supporter of maintaining services within the NHS and this includes keeping hospitals open. I have done a lot of work locally in relation to the Wharfedale Hospital and the need to make more use of it. I would certainly oppose any hospital closure in the constituency or Leeds as a whole.*

*The TTIP is certainly controversial. There are a number of aspects about the proposal which would prove beneficial the UK and UK businesses, however there are clear concerns over the inclusion of ISDS. These concerns are widespread and Jean Claude Juneker has recently removed the autonomy of the Trade Commissioner in relation to ISDS. I also recently voted for a Private Members Bill which seeks to exempt the NHS from the TTIP negotiations. I will certainly continue to monitor progress of the negotiations and raise ongoing conerns with ministers.*

*The NHS should always remain free at the point of delivery and should not become a two-tier system. Such moves would not be in the interests of the British public and would rightly be met with serious criticism.*

*Once again, thank you for contacting me in relation to these issues and please do not hesitate to get in touch on this or any other issue in the future.*

*Yours sincerely*

*Greg Mulholland MP*
*Leeds North West*

*On Monday the 24th of November NHS staff in England And Northern Ireland are to strike again. This follows years of pay freezes and caps with Jeremy Hunt still refusing to meet to settle this dispute leaving our most valuable public servants with no choice but to take further action.*

*GMB conducted an official ballot of 22,000 members in the NHS in England and Northern Ireland. There was overwhelming support for industrial action against the government’s and employers’ pay policies. The pay offer is an unconsolidated 1% pay award in 2014 restricted to staff not eligible for incremental progression, and the same approach in 2015. This goes against the recommendation of the independent NHS Pay Review Body for a 1% consolidated pay rise for all staff.*

*I hope you, will support the strike in person or in spirit and will lend your voice to the voiceless and ignored health workers of our nation by writing to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urging him to meet with the Unions and reach a fair resolution.*

*I also hope you could confirm that you support a publicly funded and run NHS, and would appreciate if it you could confirm if you agree with the following statements to make your position clear.*

*1:  Private Finance Initiative (PFI) should be removed from the NHS with existing contracts renegotiated or brought out at the soonest possible opportunity.*

*2: We should fully oppose the EU-USA trade deal (TTIP) that makes NHS privatisation irreversible while it contains any ISDS clauses, acknowledging that any attempt to exempt the NHS from such a deal will be futile while such a clause exists*

*3: A two or multi-tier heath service with uneven standards and service provision is immoral and unacceptable, the marketisation of the NHS should be undone with the abolition foundation status hospitals / trusts and their reintegration back into the NHS.*

*4: Health care services should be free at the point of delivery for all service users, means testing should not be required to access services.*

*I would appreciate a clear yes or no answer to each point, and while any elaboration on your reasoning would be welcome, the clarity of your position on these matters is of paramount importance with the General Election taking place in the next six months.*

*Finally I like many other local residents would like to thank you again for voting against the 2012 Health and Social Care Act.*

*Warm Regards*

I've also sent the same letter to the local Labour candidate, he's bumped into me a couple of times and pointed me towards his blog.

Let's assume an average UK fuel tank of 50L.  Petrol has an energy density of roughly 32 megajoules/ liter, which means that a full tank has 1600 megajoules of chemical potential energy, or about 444 kilowatt hours.

The average human is able to do about 1 kilowatt hour per day of work, in an 8 hour day.  Therefore your fuel tank has about 444 days of human equivalent labour stored in it.  That's around 10500 hours.  At a minimum wage of £6.50 that's £70,000 worth of human-equivalent labour, for about a £70 fill up.  Even at $1000 a barrel oil is cheap.  In fact it's probably the single greatest bargain in the history of humanity, and likely the best we will ever find.

We have a drum kit, speakers, mics, turntables, lots of records, guitars and more. We will be holding a meeting early next year to get interest and meet people who might want to make use of the opportunity.

Mansfield road is good for independent businesses, loads of new cafes and barbers popping up all the time. Likewise, I'd welcome suggestions of particularly good places to support.

Anyway, our website is here: www.platesrecords.co.uk

&gt;[The gender pay gap \(i.e. the difference between men's and women's earnings as a percentage of men's earnings\) based on median gross hourly earnings (excluding overtime) for full-time employees increased to 10.0% from 9.5% in 2012](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/2013-provisional-results/stb-ashe-statistical-bulletin-2013.html

The World Economic Forum now also produce [Global Gender Gap Report](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GGGR14/GGGR_CompleteReport_2014.pdf) annually. The 2014 report provides evidence for the gender pay gap in the UK and globally while also looking at a range of other gender related issues.

For me to burn that off I'd have to run 2 miles in 25 minutes. 

No doubt we had more active lifestyles way back when, but I doubt 12 minute miles twice a day were in anyones routine.

Highly processed and refined foods make it much easier to become overweight. Lack of exercise is mostly a red herring. The difference between a builders expenditure and an office workers expenditure will likely be &lt;750 calories a day. A couple of chocolate bars at most.. 

It's everything to with just eating too much, even if it doesn't look like much. 

People need to be educated better on how many calories they actually need, and how many calories are actually in something.

false,nowitasshole,null,null,"I think it'll make a big difference to the way that teams set up against us.

Comparing this season to last, I think the biggest difference is that the opposition have no fear and can press all over the pitch which is causing mistakes in midfield and defence. Teams can press as high up as they like because we've had no threat running in behind. Last season any team that pressed high up (Arsenal &amp; Spurs being the best examples) got torn to shreds by the pace of Sterling, Sturridge and Suarez. This caused teams to sit deep and give extra attention to these 3, allowing space and time for Gerrard and Henderson in the middle who shone. 

I think Balo and Lambert have done what's been asked of them minus the goals. They've held the ball up well when we've gone long to counter the high press but they're just isolated too often. Teams don't need to double up on either of them because they can't beat players when 1-on-1, which means everyone trying to get in support is easily controlled. With our strikers having their back to goal and support players being marked, we just end up playing it back to the defenders and slowing down every single move. It's why we've played better football in the last 2 with Sterling up front who teams are scared of because he'll turn and run, the downside being that he isn't a natural finisher.

The only way we're going to go back to last seasons type of football is if teams fear us and start setting up how we want them to, which having 2 fast mobile forwards in S&amp;S gives us. It won't be a quick magic fix because it'll take time for Sturridge to hit last seasons form (if that's even possible without Suarez), but I do think the quality of play will improve and the form of all of our midfielders will get better because they'll have more space and time on the ball.

Another mobile and hard-working forward would be nice in January but it is a big ask.

There are 22 in Liverpool sepcifically and 20 in Manchester specifically. 23 if you include Salford (which you would do unless you were being disingenuous).

I couldn't comment on their source, but it clearly states on the Visit Liverpool site that there are more in Liverpool than anywhere else in the country bar London.

And according to Wikipedia, you haven't quite counted correctly. There are 24 in Liverpool alone and indeed 23 in Manchester and Salford. Not sure why it would be disingenuous to include Salford, as it is a separate city with its own history, regardless of proximity.

&gt;And how does it stand if you remove The Beatles? It's a valid question. Is it still up with other musical cities? Or does it drop right down the pecking order?

Don't know, it's a Guinness Book of World Records record, not a ranking. 

And I'm not sure why you'd want to remove the Beatles from the equation. They're the most important musical act in modern history. Trying to lessen Liverpool's claim because most of their success came from one band *would* be disingenuous.

Firstly, you should note that Schlumberger are an international services company who do everything from seismic to drilling.

These have no relevance to north sea oil.  Schlumberger have recently cut significant portions of their marine exploration staff since exploration budgets are currently being slashed throughout the industry, particularly in the north sea where most prospects are extremely marginal.

The main point of the article, which you completely failed to address, is that the north sea is unprofitable at $60 per barrel.  This is a cold, hard fact.  The north sea is an old, mature field with lots of rusting infrastructure which costs a bomb to maintain.  Most operators up there need at least $100, and if you factor in refurbishment and decommissioning you're probably looking at closer to $150.  Prices stay at this level for long and Aberdeen's going to be a very different city in pretty short order.

false,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"It's not as trivial a problem as you indicate, and the issue of director renumeration is an ongoing topic in academia.

**tldr - because of the agency problem we still haven't solved the best way to reward business administrators, because unfortunately historically we know they act in self-interest and even actively damage the companies they run - the problem is ongoing and has been ever since administrators and owners became separate** 

I apologise here if any of this is patronising by the way, I don't always have a good way of articulating and I'm not trying to patronise.

The story starts with the agency problem - originally businesses were built up and managed by their owners. The owner wants the business to succeed both short and long term, so the owner-manager (same person) have exactly the same aim.

But then the owner gets successful and maybe has three locations and wants to spend time with his/her family in France or something idk. So he hires a manager. The manager may be a very qualified administrator, but at the end of the day the manager works for a paycheck. His/her aim is to get paid. They know if the business fails, they won't get paid, but if the business performs badly, they also won't get paid.

Business performance tends to be a function of risk, so you take more risk - business performs better. So an owner will take accept more risk to maximise their return, but the administrator will deliberately limit risk to ensure the company 'ticks along'. For the administrator, performance maximising is less important (because they don't get the business profit) than simply ensuring the company doesn't fail.

So this is the agency problem - you hire an 'agent' to do something for you, but their interest is not 100% aligned with yours. So for about the past half century or more business owners and academia has been thinking of good ways to align these interests. One of these has been performance related pay. More profit = bigger pay. Now the administrator is encouraged to take those 'good' risks in order to maximise their profit.

The next problem to solve was now the administrators were taking too many risks, because ultimately it didn't matter if the business went under - they still got paid a nice wedge. So we came up with share options / deferred bonuses - you get paid your bonus for this year in the future, if the business continues to performs well over the next 5. We also had the problem of the administrators gaming the share price for when they got their bonuses. Nice.

Next problem (present day) is that the administrators have decided to start teaming up with other administrators to give each other back up on their respective companies. This is because the owners are now usually shareholders who aren't active enough in overseeing the administration, so it comes down to the board of directors who are bought and paid for. Essentially, 'as long as you don't fuck up what I've got going with my company, I won't fuck things up for you'.

Meanwhile shareholders and funds just get an annual report and don't really get any power to control the administration - even though they are the owners and it's their money at risk. We are starting to see in the past 10 years or so the rise of 'shareholder activism' where some company shareholders are trying to form groups to have an actual influence. But meanwhile the boards of the companies have all already decided what they think they should all be remunerated and so they influence their own rewards at this point.

They're certainly not innocent, they might not be guilty of the most egrarious offenses but they still participate in collusion and deliberately misrepresenting reality to the ownership (e.g. shareholders) in order to keep a good thing going. The worst bit - we know this, it's not a secret, but at this point the belief in government and for shareholders is that 'better the devil you know' - keeping the colluding cronies in power but keeping an eye on them is better than breaking apart 'the system' which may just cause more fallout as investors across the world lose confidence.

Whilst it may be galling to be considering repaying ~£22,000 of debt and leaving relatively little of your inheritance left, it seems like a pretty sensible choice.

Definitely consider repaying the 9.9% loan - this is a high-interest loan and it is unlikely that any investment would outperform this over the long-term.

Do your parents know of the inheritance? Have they let you know how they feel about you repaying the borrowed money? You may find that they are happy not to call in their loan until you're set up and working, and if it's essentially interest free there is an argument to be made for this.

The same goes with your overdraft - student overdrafts are generally free money (as long as it is interest-free), and you would be making a gain not paying this off even if the £2,000 was just sat in a savings account earning 1.5% AER.

The credit card should be repaid, as it is likely a high APR.

You'll probably have £10,000-£15,000 left after debt repayments, depending on how the conversation goes with your parents/your views on repaying overdrafts (even though it is interest free you may feel more comfortable repaying entirely). 

I'd suggest that it should all be kept in cash away from your usual spending until you know what you are going to do post-university.

That *is* the claim.

&gt;But the claim is that Liverpool is the most significant musical city in the country because it has the most number ones.

Who said that?

&gt;If you can take away the number ones from the Beatles and Liverpool disappears from the ranks then that just means that the Beatles are important. 

Which is pure speculation, as we don't have any such ranks.

And yes, it means the Beatles are important, but it's not like they just happened to be from Liverpool; they're a direct product of the musical scene and sound.

&gt;If you took away Oasis from Manchester, would it have the same effect? I doubt it, because there's greater strength in depth.

Aside from the fact that Oasis are nowhere near the Beatles, I don't really know what would make you think that Manchester's music scene has more 'depth'.

I say this because we have, over recent years, seen many examples of politicians working for the good of either themselves or their own political party, rather than for the good of the general public.

However we don't merely need to trust the Home Secretary, but also the members of the intelligence services who control the information and ask for the warrants. This seems dubious - to me they are complete strangers, so it's very difficult for me to have any confidence in their moral behaviour, especially since, in at least some intelligence service positions, an aptitude for deception is often seen as a positive attribute. I'm sure this extends into the on-line realm as well as traditional intelligence activities.

We should take into account that there is historical evidence of conspiracies within the intelligence services of western countries. Not only are there very recent cases of the CIA lying to the senate intelligence committee in the US, but we can also look at historical affairs such as the bugging of Harold Wilson and the Watergate affair.

If during those earlier years, when our intelligence services were actively working against the proper functioning of democracy, they had the same access to information currently available to GCHQ, then how much more power would they have amassed, and how much harder would they have been to expose? 

I don't understand why some people in this thread are dismissing these concerns as idle paranoia, when we know as a fact that they have historical precedent. ",0,1418906317,null,0,1418906538,0,cmyiqd6,t3_2oykm3,t1_cmyiqd6,t1_cmxwc6k,null,1425338397,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

After  5 April 2015, the company will complete a p11d which will list the benefit for the year. They will then pay any class 1A nic due. 

So in the current year it will be worth calling HMRC to say 'look I'm receiving medical benefit worth 10pm from X date. They will then amend CY tax coding to reflect this.

But then notions of blame tend to be hotly contested, so let's at least tackle the point of his excursion:

&gt; The good news is that this film and even this correspondence will reach hundreds of thousands of people and they’ll learn how they’re being conned by the financial industry and turned against one another – that’s got to be a good thing, even if it makes me look a bit of a twit in the process and the national dish of Spain is eaten sub-par.

In what way will they learn this, given by his own admission he was unable to question any of ""the mob"" over their bonus packages and salaries? Is Brand living in some alternate dimension where bankers are tremendously popular and well thought of? And how did he find out about the problem, other than through reading existing journalism by people who understand the situation far better than he does?

&gt; And it’s not just RBS mate. Lloyds, Barclays, Citibank and HSBC have all been found guilty of market rigging and not one banker has been jailed.

Is Brand aware many of the cases he refers to are ongoing? [Or that market manipulation is not always a crime under UK law](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-26/market-manipulation-should-be-a-crime)? 

To quote Ian Hislop [in a recent interview on YouTube](http://youtu.be/GBfWQnjZeLY?t=14m19s):

&gt; The trouble about political life at the moment is people are so fed up with it. So all young people say ""Russell Brand's really interesting. He's got a lot to say."" And all old people say ""Oh Nigel Farage, he's really interesting – got a lot to say."" And neither's true. They're just pointing out obvious sources of dissatisfaction and not presenting any solutions.

The reason nobody attacks what Brand is saying is because there's nothing substantive to attack. He doesn't have a sophisticated understanding of political life, law, finance or any of the subjects you need to be appraised of to offer a meaningful critique of politics right now. And he appeals to people who also lack that understanding, just as Ukip does on the other side of politics.

&gt; **It should be noted that obesity does not in itself constitute a ‘disability’ within the meaning of Directive 2000/78**, on the ground that, by its nature, it does not necessarily entail the existence of a limitation as referred to in paragraph 53 of this judgment.

&gt; However, in the event that, under given circumstances, the obesity of the worker concerned entails a limitation which results in particular from physical, mental or psychological impairments that in interaction with various barriers may hinder the full and effective participation of that person in professional life on an equal basis with other workers, and the limitation is a long-term one, obesity can be covered by the concept of ‘disability’ within the meaning of Directive 2000/78.

&gt; Such would be the case, in particular, if the obesity of the worker hindered his full and effective participation in professional life on an equal basis with other workers on account of reduced mobility or the onset, in that person, of medical conditions preventing him from carrying out his work or causing discomfort when carrying out his professional activity.

It seems they ruled that obesity *wasn't* a disability, but that its effects could be.

If you like french food - go to ""chez jacques"". It's a little cramped but the food is really good and the atmosphere is awesome. It's also in the city center, on one of the side-streets of george street.

There's a thai restaurant ""dusit"" which is on another sidestreet of george street, called thisle street. Again, superb food!

If you like sushi - Kanpai sushi is very very nice. I had sushi a few times before I went here, and I was never really that into it, but these guys know what they're doing.

Yeah, so companies can charge higher prices for drugs than they are actually worth. The whole pharmaceutical system is fucked. People will pay as much as they can pay for drug because, you know, they *need* them. That's the big problem. If you have a product that someone needs and can't go without, especially if they can only get it from you due to a patent, price doesn't matter because without it you'll ever be very, very sick or you will die.

The American healthcare system is built for businesses, not to heal people. Want to not die? Cough up $20,000? Why? Because we can charge over the actual value for medicines because there's no why you can really complain. I mean for fuck sake, you can pay $100 a stitch in America. These are not market prices, these are the prices the medical industry wants you to pay no matter what.

TUV- Lead by the most bigoted person in politics, small party and has similar policies to the DUP.

UUP- Essentially reject DUP virtually the same party imo.

Alliance- I feel as though Alliance is still a bad choice because their view on the union could change very quickly if a united Ireland was more beneficial. Which IMO it isn't right to leave a country just because they are doing badly for a time or whatever. Alliance are all about ""equality"" and have made some decisions I don't approve of like the Fleg thing. I don't believe we should fly the flag but its a different story, simply unionists in general don't trust alliance.

And then theres the DUP ""nuff said.

Essentially other than Alliance which as I said a lot of unionists don't trust all the other parties are basically smaller versions of the DUP and by voting the DUP your votes are more likely to make a difference, by voting for the largest unionist party you make it more likely that they will be the largest party as opposed to splitting the vote. 

You could argue that we should vote for Sinn Fein but for me it is a moral issue to vote for them. And the stronger the majority the more likely it is that they'll take a referendum on a united Ireland.

Sahko coming back into the mix will help, he looked great in his little cameo yesterday, in a fairly unfamiliar role and I forsee him and skrtel being our preferred partnership going forward. suso i think has been a big miss from a creative standpoint. he really flourished at almeria and I think he would have gotten some great chances to prove himself in the earlier stages of the season. i am a huge suso fan. balotelli has been injured now for 7 games...that's a lot to miss, especially considering he's already down on himself. I think if he hits rock bottom soon, his upside for the second half of the season is immense. i mean what does he have to lose, and br should tell him this, what does he have to lose to go out there and score a shitload of goals. not many people believe in him, especially all of our old ""legends"" (shut up paul ince), so go out there and play the way you know you can. lovren and glenjo have been recent so we haven't missed them as much but still a significant portion of the squad that i feel offers something to the team technically, physically and spirtually. 

now on the sturridge issue, yes we shouldn't have put all of our eggs in one basket, however, our management (as a whole) felt balo, lambo, studge and borini would be enough. it hasn't. plain and simple. but what i will tell you is that sturridge offers more than just scoring and pace...i've been saying this all along, it's the attitude we miss so sorely. sturridge isn't a bad attitude guy. he's confident, almost the point of arrogance and i think that's what we miss so sorely. the team doesn't look like they're really having any fun (and who would if you're losing) but when sturridge scores and does the dance, the guys love it. he is, believe it or not, one of our veterans. he is one of the 10 oldest guys on the team and i think he, more than skrtel, glenjo, toure, stevie, lovren or any of those guys, can relate to the younger players. he is a fun loving guy and you can see the joy he plays with on the pitch. but don't be fooled, he has a temper and can get angry when things don't go his way, but what i've seen from sturridge in his season and a half of playing (2 if you count the last 4 months) is that he doesn't sulk anymore. I was admittedly a skeptic of signing him from chelsea. i thought he did well at bolton and had scoring abilities, but i was worried about his attitude. boy has he proved me wrong. he wants the spotlight, he wants center stage and he can alleviate the pressure of 90% of our squad because that's what he so desparately craves. our team needs someone who is going to take the onus off of them and that's what sturridge i think offers outside of everything else. so yes sturridge may not be our savior goal scoring, but i think sturridge is our savior for team spirit behind the scenes.

**Best:** *A Christmas Carol*. I'll give *Blink* the runner-up slot, as it's a pretty unconventional Doctor-lite episode.

**Worst:** Probably *Love and Monsters*, though it has some [redeeming qualities](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2p7m44/campiest_episode/cmuhkmr). I'll give a surprise mention to *Name of the Doctor*, it's a bit of a mess for [these reasons](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2ohfpb/loose_end_with_clara_the_name_of_the_doctor/cmndfl1?context=3). But it's not the worst. And Nightmare in Silver.

**Thought-provoking:** *Amy's Choice*, very clever and thought-provoking. Has you guessing right to the end which world is real. Runner up *Listen*. Series 5 and 6 have some pretty clever episodes, such as *The Girl Who Waited*. 

**Intense:** *Midnight*. Watch it back if you haven't seen it in a while. It's one of the highlights of the RTD era. Honourable mention to *Blink*.

**Entertaining:** *The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon*. Once you get the series story arc stuff at the beginning out the way - it's a really fun self-contained story. Honourable mentions to *The Pandorica Opens / The Big Bang* and *Day of the Doctor* - brilliant, but a *little* bit fan servicey, as you would expect for the 50th. I'd say *tIA / DotM* would be more fun to a casual audience...once you get the beginning out the way.

**Most Feels:** *Doomsday*, Billie's performance is fantastic. Honourable mention to *The Angels Take Manhattan*. Flawed episode but the final goodbye between Amy and the Doctor I think is great. Matt's performance is particularly good.

And I'll add an extra category for **Most forgettable:** *42*. Go on, what happened in that episode? No cheating. I watched it a few months ago and I still can't really remember.",0,1418910684,null,0,1418911203,0,cmyjza8,t3_2pimi4,t1_cmyjza8,t3_2pimi4,null,1425337815,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I would say that he is probably on Mignolet's level of goalkeeping overall, while maybe not as good as mignolet at stopping shots, he does come up with important saves and is quite adept to stopping shots with his feet. I would venture to say while he isn't great with his feet &amp; distribution, he is better than mignolet at this.

you'd also have to consider how he would adapt to the bpl, but there are so many south americans playing well in the league now, you'd imagine he would settle. i don't think romero would be phased by the British crowds,. he's obviously played in huge matches over his career.

and that's where the main difference between a guy like mignolet and romero is for me, he's just tougher, more assertive, more aggressive, and looks more confident. I've always though that your goalie should be your most aggressive player on the pitch, and that he should fill the defenders in front with confidence. This is where mignolet falls short, cuz the way he stands on his line and flaps is more of a confidence issue than a coaching problem.

anyway, romero would be a solid choice in the meantime, but I am pretty sure all liverpool fans realize that the he wouldn't be the answer for the next decade and that whole goalie issue isn't the root of our problem, it's merely a symptom.

sorry for rambling.

If you get into Birmingham at 10, I'd recommend staying in the city centre for a bit - it should be nice and you can have a look around the bullring and such!

You can see them by the gate by the team shop (there will be a group of fans around so you should be able to tell) 

After the game, it's quite jam packed with people getting out, but there will always be taxis hovering around. One thing I recommend is always keep your valuables away from sight - Villa Park isn't rough or anything that you need to be worried about, but there are some shady characters.

He also doesn't make any counter-point to the point stated in the letter that we will very likely end up eventually selling RBS for a profit. We are already doing so with Lloyds.

Instead he seems to be implying - though critically he never says it directly, like the aspiring politician he is - that we should have taken control of RBS, and stopped any bonuses being paid for good performance. If we had done this, all the good staff would have left for other banks, RBS would never make any money again, and we would have lost our investment.

The Conservatives still got 400,000 votes in Scotland in the last General Election. They are much more relevant in Scotland than the SNP are in the rest of the UK because hundreds of thousands of people vote for them and the map would look rather different if those votes were thrown behind another party.

Growing up in on the West Coast of Cumbria, I would actively partake in shooting, mainly Rooks, Rabbits etc. I've shot Deer for food also, as a family friend owns a Deer farm not to far from our house.  We would shoot a Deer every year and have venison for Christmas dinner. My father was a falconer and I would shoot rabbits and deep freeze them for the months when flying was restricted due to the off season.

Anyway, I've far more experience with firearms than most. I've fire shotguns, rifles (.22, .303) and air rifles.  I'm fully aware of the damage that can be caused by an Air Rifle.  If you've ever had any experience with them, you'll know that they become pretty much none lethal after 50 yards (quite a small distance). Sure, you'd get a nice bruise and a hell of a sting but it's not too likely to be lethal.  Now a .303 will kill you from 3000 yards.

To conclude, if you're not educated on the subject (like yourself) I can see why you'd panic and get all up in arms about it (excuse the pun).  People walking about with Air Rifles was a daily sight for me and wouldn't concern me too much. I'm sorry my response to this pretty benign situation wasn't one of utter panic. I guess some of us use our common sense to assess situations, rather than take the DailyMail readers route and hit the panic button.

Have a nice day anyway.

Yes. http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/trespass_and_nuisance_on_land/#a06 . Ultimately it's private property, like your house. If you ask me to leave your house, and I don't, I'm trespassing. If they asked Russel to leave (for whatever reason) and he didn't, he's trespassing.

&gt; Because he'll present evidence in the film?

But he wont present film evidence of how they're being conned, in this case, he'll present evidence of how he walked into a bank, got the place locked down, and was forced to leave. That doesn't  shine any light on what goes on in there - it's not evidence for anything.

Can't argue with you regarding market manipulation. It should be a crime, I think that's what Russel is getting at.

&gt; That's not actually true - what's actually true is that he points out obvious and clear things to do, but that's stuff that the people in charge aren't willing to do (mainly because it stops their kickbacks, old boys clubs and general corruption - just not good for business).

No he doesn't. Russel has said it himself, he's a campaigner, not a politician. His job is to raise awareness, not present solutions. What solution does he present to the bailing out of the banks? What solution does he present regarding bonuses other than ""they should be locked up"" - who should be locked up? and why? So we remove the people in charge - then what? Who replaces them?

In comparison if someone dies of a drug overdose in a club, it's suddenly someone elses fault. Not the fault of the person taking the drugs, they are all innocent of course and we must seek to blame someone else.

When Leah Betts died, her parents went on a fucking crusade against drugs yet not once did they consider individual responsibility. Read any of their quotes and it's all about blaming the government or blaming the police, always blaming someone else for the death of their child.

I said to my friends I'd stick by him if we could pick up 9 points from the next 5 games (which at the time were Villa, Man City, W Ham, Spurs and Hull), which is looking like a huge ask now.

false,pairyhenis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire (Soton and a bit of Wiltshire),"&gt;'Discriminate' is a loaded term but do I think someone in a wheelchair for being obese should receive disability payments? No. 

People don't end up in wheelchairs solely as a result of obesity unless they are exceptionally, morbidly super obese.  Those cases are extreme enough that many are caused by distinct internal genetic or behavioural dysfunction.  People end up in wheelchairs as a result of complications from obesity, the risks of which are dependent on genetic background.  You're effectively taxing the obese person for their genetic susceptibility to arthritis or TIID.

&gt;Being obese is a choice.

Is it, really?  How many obese people do you think wanted to end up obese? It's seriously misguided libertarian thinking to assume we are all masters of our own psychology, let alone our own biology.

My PhD, for example, examines the role of maternal obesity during pregnancy in increasing the offspring's risk of obesity in later life.  [A child who is obese is far, far more likely to be obese in their adult lives](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/115/1/22.short) than their peers who aren't, and that shouldn't be suprising.  In turn, a fat baby (often as a result of maternal obesity) is far more likely to develop into a fat child than a normal weight baby.

The entirety of her speech is actually far worse than the ""there is no such thing as society"" soundbite because she directly blames the people for the situations they're in. She then goes on a tirade saying that the people (common people I presume) are too entitled. 

&gt;What is wrong with the deterioration? [mistranscription?] I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand “I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!” or “I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!” “I am homeless, the Government must house me!” and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and[fo 29] there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations, because there is no such thing as an entitlement unless someone has first met an obligation and it is, I think, one of the tragedies in which many of the benefits we give, which were meant to reassure people that if they were sick or ill there was a safety net and there was help, that many of the benefits which were meant to help people who were unfortunate—“It is all right. We joined together and we have these insurance schemes to look after it”. That was the objective, but somehow there are some people who have been manipulating the system and so some of those help and benefits that were meant to say to people: “All right, if you cannot get a job, you shall have a basic standard of living!” but when people come and say: “But what is the point of working? I can get as much on the dole!” You say: “Look” It is not from the dole. It is your neighbour who is supplying it and if you can earn your own living then really you have a duty to do it and you will feel very much better!”

&gt;There is also something else I should say to them: “If that does not give you a basic standard, you know, there are ways in which we top up the standard. You can get your housing benefit.”

&gt;But it went too far. If children have a problem, it is society that is at fault. There is no such thing as society.[fo 30] There is living tapestry of men and women and people and the beauty of that tapestry and the quality of our lives will depend upon how much each of us is prepared to take responsibility for ourselves and each of us prepared to turn round and help by our own efforts those who are unfortunate. And the worst things we have in life, in my view, are where children who are a great privilege and a trust—they are the fundamental great trust, but they do not ask to come into the world, we bring them into the world, they are a miracle, there is nothing like the miracle of life—we have these little innocents and the worst crime in life is when those children, who would naturally have the right to look to their parents for help, for comfort, not only just for the food and shelter but for the time, for the understanding, turn round and not only is that help not forthcoming, but they get either neglect or worse than that, cruelty.

&gt;How do you set about teaching a child religion at school, God is like a father, and she thinks “like someone who has been cruel to them?” It is those children you cannot ... you just have to try to say they can only learn from school or we as their neighbour have to try in some way to compensate. This is why my foremost charity has always been the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, because over a century ago when it was started, it was hoped that the need for it would dwindle to nothing and over a hundred years later the need for it is greater, because we now realise that the great problems in life are not those of housing and food and standard of living. When we have[fo 31] got all of those, when we have got reasonable housing when you compare us with other countries, when you have got a reasonable standard of living and you have got no-one who is hungry or need be hungry, when you have got an education system that teaches everyone—not as good as we would wish—you are left with what? You are left with the problems of human nature, and a child who has not had what we and many of your readers would regard as their birthright—a good home—it is those that we have to get out and help, and you know, it is not only a question of money as everyone will tell you; not your background in society. It is a question of human nature and for those children it is difficult to say: “You are responsible for your behaviour!” because they just have not had a chance and so I think that is one of the biggest problems and I think it is the greatest sin.",0,1418914224,null,0,false,0,cmylatc,t3_2po23t,t1_cmylatc,t1_cmyhs1c,null,1425337139,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Accommodation doesn't have to be expensive. I paid 380 pcm for private accommodation. The problem is more going to be finding something other than uni accommodation at a distance; it's a small town. 

To be honest, if you aren't interested in the halls, I could suggest uni *managed* accommodation. This is property that is owned privately, but the university acts as a letting agent. Sort of. Have a look at the Accommodation Office pages in early spring - there are residences reserved for postgraduates in and out of the centre of town.

Personally, I'm glad I got out of halls after my first year - unlike our American friend I am not interested in the ""wild partying"". A postgraduate degree should be more work and less play than an undergraduate, but of course that varies between university and subject. (*Insert dig at Arts degree here.*) 

Don't worry about being international. From experience, I wouldn't say there is much to say specifically to international students. Don't have expectations for the food or weather.

But so does yours. Can you present me a logical reason as to why they would lock the doors and turf him out, if he *wasn't* doesn't something wrong. Even if he was doing something they disagree with which we may both agree with, fact is, it's more likely that they asked him to leave before locking the place down. My argument has shown that yours is flawed. Anyway, your underlying point was the trespassing couldn't happen in a public shop for asking questions. My answer and evidence disproves that.

&gt; Oh you've seen how they've put together and editted the film? It would be grossly negligent to make this film without attempting to talk to them, how he chooses to depict that in the film is up to him, let me give you a hint though, it's not going to be 90 minutes of ""Oh go on, say you did it, please! go on! Tell the camera! Say it!""

Again, your underlying point was that he'll present evidence from that event. The fact is, he got no evidence for his argument at that event. Evidence that they enforce trespassing laws isn't evidence of of corruption or scandal.

&gt; Not bailing out the banks. Duh.

Except that's not a solution, because that would require going back in time. And please explain to me what you think would have happened without the bailout of the banks. One consequence would be the millions of UK citizens with savings in RBS would have lost them totally. Again, you've not provided anything to back up your argument that he presents clear things to do.

A vacuum in a position of wealth and power - what could possibly go wrong?

&gt; Who Cares.

Probably your friends and families who would lose all their savings should the banks collapse and fail totally.

It does annoy me a bit when parents have made no effort to teach their child how to interact with dogs. And when dog owners make no effort to teach their dogs how to interact with children. The trouble often is that dogs and children are very similar. They both want to play with each other, but have very different ideas about what that involves.

&gt;An ___ad hominem___ ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for ""to the man"" or ""to the person"" ), short for ___argumentum ad hominem___, means responding to arguments by attacking a person's character, rather than to the content of their arguments.

&gt; We invested in the banks, let's not destroy the good parts of them just to appease people who want ""justice""

I didn't bloody well want to invest in the banks, yet I did. And what are the good parts? Are the bonuses a good part?

The problem is the system is so fucked that most of what I want to happen won't work. As you say, if we remove bonuses from British banks then all the so called talent will move to other international banks, sort of like a football team. Reduce wages in one country and they players will transfer to somewhere else.

I suppose I'm an idealist in this regard. I'd love it to be a better system, but unless the whole world agrees to it (good luck with that) then it won't happen.

My firm state the following:

&gt; What about taxation on the benefit?
&gt;
&gt; As your premium is paid for by the firm, it is classed as a benefit-in-kind, and you have to pay tax on the value of the benefit (which for 2014/15 is £472.39 ). This will be reported at the end of the year as a P11d item. 
&gt;
The tax for this benefit is automatically collected by the Inland Revenue through an adjustment to your following year’s tax code. **You therefore pay tax on a benefit one year in arrears.**
&gt; 
We send a P11d form to the Inland Revenue at the end of the tax year so they know how much tax to charge you for the following year.

Do you want to go up to the Stanley barracks, go out on a frigate or to the new territories?” I said, “No, Governor. I would like to see your astrologer.” And as Governor of Hong Kong he had one. I went to meet the astrologer and he was very concerned about the buildings around Government House.

&gt;I have been to India and talked to people there and to the Indian Government about the Indian astrological system, lahiri, which is part of their culture. In western culture, Culpeper’s book, “Astrological Judgement of Diseases from the Decumbiture of the Sick” of 1655 is the longest in print, so in all cultures we have that tradition.

&gt;I will conclude my remarks because I know I will get a lot of friendly e-mails for having had the temerity to talk about astrology in this House, but I am absolutely convinced that those who look at the map of the sky for the day that they were born and receive some professional guidance will find out a lot about themselves, and it will make their life easier.

Your argument boils down to: People don't understand the numbers, lets just simplify the numbers and everyone has the willpower to just add them up and they will be fine.

My argument is that calorie counting alone won't work - because sugar is in many foods - it is NOT counted as part of the calories (on the packet) and it is also addictive.

I mean, you are able to gain and lose weight - fantastic, great for you!

Newsflash: Not everyone is like you or has your mentality or experiences... especially when it comes to addiction.

Addiction is the reason people have difficulty giving up smoking, alchohol drugs and yes, even sugary foods. The government regulates the first two, bans the third and ignores the last one.

&gt;""Smoking Kills""

&gt;""Smoking when pregnant harms your baby""

&gt;""Smoking may reduce the blood flow and cause impotence""

See...? Facts... printed on packets... has every single person in the UK stopped smoking?

The fact is all the information is there already available to people, but just publishing information doesn't work... not when psychology and addiction comes into it.

Your kind of self-aggrandizing is the worst kind when it comes to people who are depressed, unhappy and have addictions.

false,botttled_water,null,null,"from wikipedia: The Gallup Organization took an opinion poll at the end of April and found that 74 per cent agreed with what Powell had said in his speech; 15 per cent disagreed. 69 per cent felt Heath was wrong to sack Powell and 20 per cent believed Heath was right. Before his speech Powell was favoured to replace Heath as Conservative leader by 1 per cent, with Reginald Maudling favoured by 20 per cent; after his speech 24 per cent favoured Powell and 18 per cent Maudling. 83 per cent now felt immigration should be restricted (75 per cent before the speech) and 65 per cent favoured anti-discrimination legislation.[24]

Furthermore what we are seeing in places with high immigration is the dividing of groups along ethnic lines and we really aren't seeing great integration, especially along religious lines. If you lived in Barking and Dagenham about 10 years ago, the population was 80.1% white. Today it is 49.5% white. If you were living there, would you not feel a bit wary? It's easy enough to maybe make an opinion if there are 2 indian families in your neighbourhood, but watching the entire social fabric of your community change from one which was majority white british to one that perhaps has a culture totally alien to you, would you not feel as though things were bad? This is not just going to be what London faces, but what the whole country faces if immigration is allowed to continue unabated. Today the immigrant population is perhaps not a big problem, but to say that in the future it will not be a big problem simply because today it is not, well that's just wrong. We will face issues we have never faced before as a country, such as islamic extremism, and that will affect the politics of the whole country. These issues will not go away, islamic extremism is not just disappearing, it's actually getting worse. If we continue down this path things will get worse.

To be honest, I come from a community that is torn along religious lines (Northern Ireland), and to see parts of England going down a similar route is really quite saddening. I believe there is an ability of a country to absorb a certain amount of immigrants, but the amount of immigration we face today is just unprecedented.

The best examples of False-9's are Tevez and Messi in my opinion, though Suarez would also fit the mould very well.

I'd be reluctant to see us try it this season because it strikes me as a formation that needs to work *perfectly* to be effective. Everything hinges on the false-9 managing to drag the CB's out of position, thereby creating gaps for the wingers.

1. Pick a subject (or two subjects, if you want to do a combined honours). Look at the league tables for this subject to find out what other students and the stats say about them. 

2. Examine what your predicted grades are vs. what different unis are asking for. Cut out all the ones that are absolutely unrealistically high (say you're probably gonna get 300 UCAS points and somewhere is asking for 340, don't apply there unless you think you have a chance of getting there - otherwise it's a wasted slow) and all the ones that are ridiculously low. 

3. Now you should have unis which you can aim for, unis which you'll probably get into and unis which have low enough grades that you can be certain you'll get into, but not too low. From there, think about location. Do you want to go to Scotland for the low costs? Live in a big city? Live somewhere historic? Is the night life important to you? Narrow out all the unis which don't match your criteria. 

4. You shouldn't have many unis left now, so look at the actual course layouts for them. Compare them and work out which you like and which you don't. Are they flexible? Are the modules interesting? Is the course focused in the way you'd like? Work out your priorities and cut unis out accordingly. 

5. Finally, you should be left with 5 unis. Pick two which are aiming high, two which are aiming about normal and one which you'll definitely get into. For example, let's say you're on 300 UCAS points. You'd pick two that are like 320, because there's a strong chance you can work hard and get that. Then two which are on 300, because they're what you're working at now. Then one which is like 280, because you need a back up. Don't sell yourself short or aim too high. 

6. Wait for your offers. When you have them, you need to pick a firm choice and an insurance choice. Pick whichever uni you like the most for your firm, then pick one with a lower offer for your insurance; the insurance is useless if the grade they want is equal to or higher than your firm.

If, for example, Colin Jackson launched an all out attack on a child, the consequences would be very serious. But how likely is he to do that?

The claim that aggression on the part of a dog is ""100% the owner"" is not accurate, though. Although it may be the majority of the problem,  there will be a certain amount that can be attributed to the temperament of the dog itself, potential mental problems (dogs can have brain problems, just like anything else) and external factors such as negative experiences in their early life. 

No dog is automatically good or bad with children/people/other dogs. Some breeds will more readily pick up certain negative behaviours, but almost all can be trained out of them. 

The reason that dog attacks are more likely to be carried out by staffies (and similar), though, is that they are often owned by people who, for whatever reason, want them to be aggressive and either actively encourage them to be so, or do nothing to discourage them when they show signs of aggression. This can be done with any dog, but Staffies, unfortunately for them, look the part. 

I don't think limiting specific breeds is the answer. The only reason people have taken up Staffies is that they banned the pit bull. Ban the Staffie and they'll move on to something else. Much better instead to control ownership of dogs in general.

Trespass is a civil offence, not a crime. Not typically one for prosecution. Why do you find it hard to believe he engaged in trespass? What you're doing is special pleading. Russel was there, the owners of the private establishment didn't want him there - trespass. They were perfectly entitled to respond how they did. So you've not answered that issue.

True. Do you think that money would just appear in their (non-existent) bank accounts over night? Citizens also need businesses to employ them and sell them basic stuff.

No, what I'm saying is nobody knows the ramifications, because there's no real solutions posed. People like you and Russel think the answer is just pointing out problems with a handful of words. You don't answer the questions, and neither does Russel.

It was his responsibility to hire the second and third level managers and to make a judgement call on whether they were competent to lead their teams in line with company policy and to hire subordinates who can do the same. 

There will always be isolated cases of rogue managers or departments undermining the company ethos that a senior manager couldn't have reasonably known about. However, the chances that this was happening in most major UK banks and bad, lazy or cynical decisions made right at the top had nothing to do with it, and they couldn't have reasonably foreseen the consequences?

This year, all too often our attacks are thwarted (easily), and we're immediately put under pressure. With no defensive mid and our supposedly holding midfielder sucked up the pitch, our back four are now immediately under pressure in acres of space. Having watched every game this season, this sounds pretty familiar to me. I also immediately had a random mental association with Lucas as (occasionally) providing some relief in this vein.

To change gears some, something I noticed yesterday, that I haven't seen since August, is our team play compact and tight. A lot of people have been claiming our team played with a very offensive formation, but I viewed it really as the opposite. We were set up to counter attack a lot more than to straight up attack. On defense we would have 5 in the back, plus lucas, with our other 4 outfield players either behind or close to the ball and we would break quickly. Sterling, on numerous occasions was seen running with the ball from midfield at 4-5 defenders. i like that, sort of, but against arsenal, I want to see us play super compact and break on counter attack again.

That's not necessarily true, lots of other solutions were available, you could redirect them to the banks that didn't fail. 

&gt;A government bailing out millions of individual citizens would not be easier.

It's not about being ""easy"". 

&gt; Another point you've not answered.

There's a difference between something I've not answered, and something I've answered with an answer you don't like. 


&gt; What makes you think the people who would replace them would be any better? 

Because the new system would actually have an incentive not to engage in those practices that bought the old system down. 


&gt;How is what's being proposed any different from how the existing system is supposed to work?

The proposal is *to make it work*. The point is there are all these laws and all these regulations that were either not applied, not correctly applied or not correctly divised. The proposal is to fix that, and the first part of that is to remove incentives for failed organisations. 

&gt; People like you and Russel think the answer is just pointing out problems with a handful of words.

yeah i totally agree with everything you just said. i think this was interesting, too (and it may be because bournemouth are just slower than BPL teams?) but we looked like we were running harder and were the much faster team by a good bit. I don't know what BR put in their water, but I want him to do it more often. 

balotelli, if healthy and fit for saturday (and if he plays), i think will score 2 goals. he was on point against mufc if it wasn't for de gea...i mean who the fuck makes those saves regularly? de gea is quickly becoming the only man u player i like, and that's based purely off of how good he is. i mean christ he's top 3 gk in the world right now imho. 

we'll see how we line-up vs arsenal, but i like the idea of staying compact and breaking on the wings with sterling and markovich with balotelli as the front man. I would plop balo up top though and not have him drop deep to do defensive work. I want him solely focused on attacking. basically have 5 full time defenders, a 6th (maybe gerrard or hendo) who connects defense with attack and then coutinho, sterling, marko and balo who will just run at defenses. I full believe that we contain arsenals attack if we stay compact.

&gt;The __Yugoslav Wars__ were [ethnic conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_conflict) fought from 1991 to 1999 on the territory of former [Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia). The wars accompanied the [breakup of the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia), where its constituent republics declared independence, but the issues of ethnic minorities in the new countries (chiefly [Serbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs) in central parts and [Albanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians) in the southeast) were left unresolved after those republics were recognized internationally. The wars are generally considered to be a series of largely separate but related military conflicts occurring in and affecting most of the former Yugoslav republics:

No they can't, medium and large dogs bred for running collies and grey hounds for example have relatively fragile lightly muscled jaws because anything more would just slow them down.

Border Collies for example are often rather nervous dogs with something of a tendency to bite but their attacks tend to be far less serious than those by fighting dogs.

Multiple U.S. presidents owned dogs, too. Does that mean the U.S. economy was based on dogs? Get out of here with this shitty argumentation.

&gt; And slavery (and basically the equivalent after they were ""freed"") was a primary reason why the US economy skyrocketed in the country's infancy (so many links to back up I can't even just choose one). 

Wrong. From de Tocqueville:

*Another very remarkable thing is Ohio is this: Ohio is perhaps the State of the Union in which it is easiest to see, in a striking way and close up, the effects of slavery and of liberty on the social state of a people. The State of Ohio is separated from Kentucky just by one river; on either side of it the soil is equally fertile, and the situation equally favorable, and yet everything is different.*

*Here a population devoured by feverish activity, trying every means to make its fortune; the population seems poor to look at, for they work with their hands, but that work is the source of riches. There is a people which makes others work for it and shows little compassion, a people without energy, mettle or the spirit of enterprise. On one side of the stream, work is honored and leads to all else, on the other it is despised as the mark of servitude. Those who are forced to work to live cross over into Ohio where they can make money without disgrace.*

*The population of Kentucky, which has been peopled for nearly a century, grows slowly. Ohio only joined the Confederation thirty years ago and has a million inhabitants. Within those thirty years Ohio has become the entrepot for the wealth that goes up and down the Mississippi; it has opened two canals and joined the Gulf of Mexico to the North Coast; meanwhile Kentucky, older and perhaps better placed, stood still.*

*These differences cannot be attributed to any other cause but slavery. It degrades the black population and enervates the white. Its fatal effects are recognized, and yet it is preserved and will be preserved for a long time more. Slavery threatens the future of those who maintain it, and it ruins the State; but it has become part of the habits and prejudices of the colonist, and his immediate interest is at war with the interest of his own future and the even stronger interest of the country.*

*So nothing shows more clearly than the comparison I have just made that human prosperity depends much more on the institutions and the will of man than on the external circumstances that surround him. Man is not made for slavery; that truth is perhaps even better proved by the master than by the slave.*

&gt; This applies here, as we should be better than want to have a slave-owning government own our team.

You can SEE the way Borini plays and Balo plays and its quite obvious Balo is miles ahead in almost every respect. What people dont realize is that Balo needs real psychological support and guidance. Hes never had a father or familial figure in anyway and is always being chased by the media. His manager treats him like an investment and so does everyone else around him. Hes never had the greatest work ethic just loads of talent. If Liverpool could seriously get  an exclusive psychiatrist for him and start protecting him from the media, I truly believe he will come good for us. Balo needs nurturing and I know people think thats a load of shit and all athletes go through pressure but Balo is a special case in the sense that he was abandoned by his own parents and raised by italians and then on the same hand the nation that saved him and gave him an opportunity calls him monkey and other derogatory shit. He just has never had a situation where he could look up to someone and confide and them and have them tell him that hes being an idiot. All he has is yesmen and media, combine with obvious social and mental issues. Professional sports is brutal and people need to treat some players like a human being and put a little more focus on them to get the best out of them. He goes back to Italy all the time because of his desire for home and thats the only place he feels comfortable.

When the effort's not there week in week out, it's frustrating. Especially with teammates who are always hustling, scoring goals, and having to do extra to cover mistakes. I admit I was not happy with him earlier in the year. He's obviously talented as you say, so when people say they want to see him benched, it's mostly as a way to motivate him, not punish him. 

I think a big part of why people want him to go now is to get a new player. Yes Yaya is still great. But to some fans that means now is the time to sell. If you want to get the most money for a player, so that you can get a good new player, you sell that old player when people still believe he can add a lot of value to a team. Yaya *can* still do this, and people want to make sure the team sells him before his skills start to decline, or at least before big teams stop being willing to pay big money for him. 

Yeah the birthday thing was overblown. But was it overblown by us or Yaya? I really don't know how it actually played out. But it was more than just the cake. It was him and his manager saying different things, rumors about wanting to go to different teams, saying Yaya is unhappy because the club made him travel instead of letting him go see his sick brother... I don't know what's true, but it painted Yaya in a very dark light. Good news is, I think most fans have moved on from that stuff by now, and the ""hate"" directed at him recently has more to do with his performance on the field.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNjq8CkDqCM
&gt;Anti EP was a protest against the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which would prohibit raves (described as gatherings where music is played), with ""music"" being defined as a ""succession of repetitive beats.""[2] Sean Booth explained the band's strategy for the song ""Flutter"" by saying, ""We made as many different bars as we could on the drum machine, then strung them all together.""[2]

&gt;The packaging for both compact disc and vinyl variants bore a sticker with a disclaimer about the repetitive nature of the rhythmic elements of ""Lost"" and ""Djarum"". The third track, ""Flutter"", was programmed to have non-repetitive beats and therefore ""can be played at both forty five and thirty three revolutions""; but following their disclaimer, it was advised that DJs ""have a lawyer and a musicologist present at all times to confirm the non repetitive nature of the music in the event of police harassment."" The sticker acted as a seal, which was required to be broken in order to access the media enclosed in the packaging.[3]

&gt;The profits from this release went to the British pressure group Liberty (the National Council for Civil Liberties.) The second half of the sticker featured information about Liberty, with this last statement: ""Autechre is politically non-aligned. This is about personal freedom.""[3]

&gt;Despite ""Flutter""'s ability to be played at two different speeds on vinyl, the CD version contains the song as played at 45 RPM. ""Lost"" and ""Djarum"" are featured at their standard 33 1⁄3 RPM speed.[4] At 33 1⁄3 RPM, ""Flutter"" would be around 13:26 in length.

Before even playing for the first team, in the youth games he scored goals but didn't develop or pay any attention to the other aspects of the game.

Then cheekily reacted to any comments from the fans or team mates.

Then he got in the team near the end of the 2011/12 season and did well. But domestically from the start of the 2012/13 season he couldn't exactly replicate his earlier form because his game was too one dimensional. In the youth games it didn't matter that his game was one dimensional. He was still a level above his opponents.

So suddenly he probably realized he had a lot of developing to do. He did score the goal against Barca and then scored in the next game against St Johnstone but the fact still remained, he still had a lot of work to do.

First, not even 50% of it was put in the IPO, so it wasn't sold to anyone promising to run it better. The people running it now were running it before the sale.

Second, RM needed to raise billions to fund a huge restructuring operation. Its main focus was on the loss-making postal service and the profit-making parcel service was at capacity. It needed to focus its main business on parcels to profit from the ever-growing online sales market ASAP to avoid being left behind in the market and having supply problems. This costs a colossal amount of money.

* Haven't left the top half of the table yet (* touch wood *). 
* We've competed in and have had a chance to win every game except maybe the second half against Chelsea and West Ham. 
* The ball movement is more purposeful. It's not stagnant in the final 3rd like it was under Laudrup or mainly in the defensive third like Rodgers.
* His signings have all done well: Sigurdsson, Fabianski, Montero in particular. Deciding to keep Ki appears to have been a good decision too.
* Younger members of the squad have had a chance in the team: Fulton, Barrow, Richards, Carroll.
* We got two tough draws in the latter stages of the league cup, and I think we were unlucky not to beat Liverpool.

A Minister should be managing their own department. Their boss cannot have a detailed view on each one below him. If the directing policy was bad, then the PM is responsible. If the policy was good, then the dept head is responsible.

Go some levels down to a junior secretary screwing up. Should that mean the Minister goes? The PM? By your logic, as I understand it, i should: because each manager should take responsibility for those under them.

Take this example: say a bunch of tube drivers on different lines conspire to delay tube trains for whatever reason (it's a horrible analogy, I know). This gets found out. Who should be sacked? Those drivers, yes. Their managers - arguably, yes, depending on if they could have known and prevented it under their job descriptions. The people responsible for checking scheduling - again, arguably, yes: at least disciplined. Those responsible for making sure that the drivers don't talk to each other about that - yes (and that's where the analogy reeeally stretches quite badly).

But what people are asking for is that the drivers are sacked. So are their managers, regardless of circumstances and if they did their best and could have prevented it. All the way up to the manager of the tube and the manager of London Transport. Then, presumably, the Minister for Transport (or it would be if the Tories hadn't sold the transport systems *precisely* to prevent the blame getting to politicians).

However, one thing you seem to be doing is considering wealth as part of the individual, which I think some people would disagree with.

That is, people have the same rights and responsibilities but they alter depending upon one's material situation: a rich person is subject to the same laws as a poor person, and if their wealth levels changed they would gain or lose rights/responsibilities accordingly (I.e. a millionaire who goes bankrupt will be eligible for benefits; an unemployed person who wins the lottery loses that access).

That's not the same as treating people differently based on some arbitrary inherent characteristic, like race, gender or sexuality. Chronically sick people have more access to the NHS than healthy people, but that's not inconsistent. Health isn't arbitrary when it comes to that healthcare; wealth is not arbitrary when it comes to wealth redistribution.

You don't think that in a world where wars are becoming increasingly rare and increasingly less lethal there might be less need to spend so much on defence?

You don't see the difference?

Yes, we can barely afford to keep a credible force in the field and can't deploy much more than a brigade on sustained operations off our own territory.

And this whole 'best spender' argument is facile. Again by our GDP % is nothing particularly ground breaking. Despite a lot of doom and gloom, reason we are 5/6 spender, is because we are a very large economy.

And for our country size, given we have about 100 active aircraft, 80k combat effective troops and around 20 capital ships..

We don't have a big armed forces, where are people getting this from?

There was no urgent need for change until Hitler decided he wanted to bully someone to distract from his economic failure. So they were not ""native Germans"" in Czechoslovakia to weaken Germany - they were German-speaking Bohemians.

Secondly, the borders of Bohemia had not changed significantly since at least the 16th century. The Bohemian Czechs had lived for centuries under a German-speaking government; the Bohemian Germans had very little ground for complaining if the tables were turned.

Thirdly, the British people are willing to fight and die over ""the rights of small nations"" (a phrase from 1880) to be protected from aggression from bigger neighbours, especially Germany: see 1914, 1939, 1950, 1982, 1990, etc. Of course the UK has been far from consistent and has been the aggressor itself on some occasions.

Liverpool - 2006/07 = 27 goals conceded,
Liverpool - 2007/08 = 28 goals conceded,

Liverpool - 2013/14 = 50 goals conceded,
Liverpool - 2014/15 = (22 already)

The game may have evolved towards scoring more goals but we have lacked defensive resilience for long. Data can be inferred either way, but I believe we badly need a very very good DM to give our midfield meat, solidarity and cover for good attacking play. 

BR's approach may be gun-ho in terms of more creativity, higher risk, higher return and less defense/parking bus, but I have always felt we never replaced Mascherano, who was immense in quarter-backing our defence. 

Per FSG's moneyball aproach, more shots on target may be the metric that guarantees points in football.

Why?  That's the question that no one ever seems to be able to answer when I ask them.  Why does the Doctor have to be a man?  What is it about him as a character that is unique to a male?  What characteristics or personality traits of his are uniquely male?  How would the Doctor being a female necessarily change him in any fundamental way? 

I really don't see what parts of the Doctor's personality are distinctly masculine in nature.  The only argument for it being a ""male role"" seems to be that it has always been a role for a man.  Well, why can't that change?  One of the core aspects of Doctor Who is that it so readily embraces change.

Then we ask if it's any internet there, and she sais yes, and we figure out we can ski back to the hut, get a laptop, and ski back, but she sais she has a laptop we can borrow if we want, but no HDMI-cable.. but we are very happy that we can probably watch the match on a laptop at least if the internet is good enough..

false,Narttu,null,null,"I think ""big city vibe"" is kinda relative. It certainly doesnt feel like you're in New York, but by British non-London standards (and European non-capital standards in general) it is a pretty large sprawl, quite densely populated and very ethnically mixed, but on the flipside it feels quite overlooked and lacking in glamour compared to many similiar sized, or even smaller, Euro cities. For example its larger than places like Amsterdam, Stockholm, Athens, Krakow etc but comes across as more provincial, less tourist-y and lacks the sense of architectural grandeur of those places, looking more industrial and gritty.

As for the original question, the city centre is kinda weird, its fairly large but its also a bit disjointed and if you take a wrong turn it can very quickly drop off into some random suburb or industrial estate. Also a good chunk of the main shopping streets in the city centre (new st, high st, union st) are pedestrianised so you wont be able to see them properly on streetview.

Anyway there are lots of neighbourhoods that are quite lively and even more when you take into account the large metropolitan area. For instance I live in Harborne about 4-5 miles southwest of the city centre and rarely even feel the need to go into the centre unless its for high end clothes shopping, cinema or clubbing. Harborne High St is decent enough for food, pubs, general shopping etc and Bearwood rd, which is double the size, is about 15 mins walk away. Other areas that have a decent concentration of shops pubs etc in the burbs that you could take a look at on streetview are Kings Heath high st,  Alcester rd in Moseley, Soho Road in Handsworth, Stratford rd and Ladypool rd in Sparkbrook/Sparkhill, Bristol Rd in Selly Oak, Bristol rd South in Northfield, Warwick rd in Acocks Green, Erdington high st...then if you head out into the wider met area theres loads more like West Bromwich, Dudley, Halesowen, Sutton Colfield. I must forewarn though that some of those areas are considered a little rough, but theyre all fine during the day. Anyway, in short, yes theres plenty to do in Brum outside of the city centre.

Letting people lend books through the post (ordering online) may also keep their legs going a little longer. But this lacks the communal nature of a central meeting place.

Many councils also have a physical point-of-use presence. Putting these in a library may also form a cost-cutting exercise which allows them to pay the upkeep.
