true,BendyZebra,null,null,"Before I moved in with my husband I didn't own a TV as I'm deaf and subtitles suck. I lived in a big apartment block that was gated (private entry by special key fob only) making it almost impossible for them to check up on people.

I was hassled *constantly* by TV Licensing. Every 3 months minimum (often more) I'd get a new letter demanding I pay for a license or prove that I didn't own a TV. They provided a telephone number, email address and postal address for you to get in touch. 

First of all I asked my friend to call them on my behalf. They refused to speak to him (Data Protection) even when he said that he could repeat their questions to me so I could lipread and then I could reply to them on speaker giving permission for him to speak on my behalf. They refused saying ""we must speak to her directly!""

So I turned to email. I sent them 7 emails and never received a reply to any of them...yet the letters kept coming, each more threatening than the last.

So then I started writing actual snail-mail letters thinking that would solve it. Nope! By this point they're threatening legal action and stated that they'd contacted the landlord to give them access to the complex so that they could conduct a home visit.

They eventually turned up at my door and rudely demanded access. I explained that I'd been trying to tell them for the last 9 months that I do not own a TV because I'm deaf and it's pointless. The guy pretty much barged his way in and wandered around, opening wardrobes/cupboards/draws etc trying to find my non-existent TV (pretty sure they aren't allowed to do that!!)

He finally stopped poking around and started having a go at me saying that I'd cost them a tonne of money because they'd had to send multiple letters and then arrange a visit. He refused to believe that I'd tried to tell them that I don't own a TV until I showed him the file I'd kept that detailed the phone call, emails and letters they'd ignored and asked what the fuck else I could have done.

He mumbled something I couldn't read, told me to call them if I got a TV (ummm, how exactly? I'm deaf, dickhead!) before storming out of my apartment.

A month later I got another letter demanding payment... *facepalm!*

I moved out shortly afterward and they finally left me alone. Morons.",0,1405989514,null,0,false,0,cj3ylzr,t3_2ba9no,t1_cj3ylzr,t1_cj3s02j,null,1434830471,2,false,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,2

true,billy-hoyle,null,null,"Back in the 90's, tickets used to be just that; actual tickets on bits of paper. When attending a game you'd keep the stub after going through the turnstile. For high demand games (such as later cup rounds), you'd prove you were a loyal supporter by showing the ticket office your collection of stubs and that'd get you access to a ticket. Obviously doing things that way has it's issues, and so when we moved to the new stadium 11 years ago they shook up the whole system, giving people loyalty points depending on how long they'd had season tickets in maine road (which was a complete mess in itself - my dad got less points than me and my brother, even though he'd been going decades before we were even born). Since then everytime you've bought a season ticket or gone to a game, you'd earn loyalty points. Now it's got to the stage where every game sells out, these loyalty points are vitally important.

The biggest games - such as the derby, and the west ham game last season/QPR 2 years ago, sell out at around 1000 loyalty points. This means that only people with 1000+ loyalty points are able to purchase tickets. You get 10 points for attending a home fixture and 20 points for attending an away fixture, as well as 25 (or 50, can't quite remember) for signing up to the blue membership/cityzens thing. (Season tickets get you a couple hundred in one go, but that isn't really important here as obviously they don't need to purchase any home game tickets). This basically means that almost everyone at a city - united game has to have been going reguarly for at least the last ~5 years. I say almost, because I've heard of city auctioning off some tickets to the highest bidders on the sly - I've seen this first hand at the 2-3 derby the other year (when fucking nasri bottled it in the wall at the end) when there were a group of camera toting asian people wearing half/half scalves (a huge no-no) quietly celebrating when rooney scored in front of us. No way have they been going to 10 games a season since 2007.

Anyway, I digress, I've had a few beers and need to go to bed. The main point is that getting a ticket to see us v united will nigh be impossible, unless you pay an arm and a leg for two (I'd guess you could buy a hospitality pair for around ~£1000), or unless you beg on the bluemoon forum for some, although you'll be joining hundreds of others who are doing the same and will most likely be just as unfortunate in not getting any. sorry fella.


*edit: I must say, that if we go ahead with the expansion plan phase 2 and have 62,000 seats by 2016, the whole game could change. That much of a jump in capacity in such a small timeframe will probably leave a window of a couple years were you'll be able to get tickets on ricidulously low loyalty points. I'd say that'd probably be the best chance you'll ever have of getting to a derby. Keep your fingers crossed that we go through with the bigger expansion.",0,1405994354,null,0,false,0,cj4103d,t3_2badm6,t1_cj4103d,t1_cj40co7,null,1434831753,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

&gt;

&gt;___Cloud Gate___ is a [public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_art) sculpture by Indian-born British artist [Anish Kapoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anish_Kapoor), that is the centerpiece of [AT&amp;T Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Plaza) at [Millennium Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Park) in the [Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop) [community area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_of_Chicago) of [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago), [Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois). The sculpture and AT&amp;T Plaza are located on top of [Park Grill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Grill), between the [Chase Promenade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Promenade) and [McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormick_Tribune_Plaza_%26_Ice_Rink). Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed __The Bean__ because of its [legume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume)-like shape. Made up of 168 [stainless steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel) plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13 m), and weighs 110 short tons (100 t; 98 long tons).

&gt;Kapoor's design was inspired by liquid [mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element\)) and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under *Cloud Gate'*s 12-foot (3.7 m) high arch. On the underside is the ""omphalos"" (Greek for ""navel""), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic [themes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(visual_arts\)), and it is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.

The way I see it, that he played for Spurs is incidental to the joke.  Apparently, everyone in England is either crushed, shocked, or thrilled (including Rio Ferdinand).  If Wayne Rooney or even Steven Gerrard had just transferred to Madrid for a record fee after a massively public transfer saga, I think the joke would have still worked.  Spurs not required.


Also ... if the part that makes this relevant to Spurs is that it's Woolwich getting mauled, then this really isn't any different from other posts that celebrate Arsenal's foibles, which routinely get criticized.  Just saying.

Just because I follow them more closely when they are not a waste of time to watch does not mean that I do not care as much.

Just because they are new does not mean that they dont care either. I would say that new fans care just as much as the old timers and have a raw passion for the team. 

We have a more refined passion. We lose to Wigan in the FA Cup Final? ""Thats typical City, building hope in us all just to let us down."" New fans might see that we lost to a relegated side and be overly made about it but I see it as ""at least we made it to the final.""

true,jahax,null,null,"Liverpool is no longer a big club in the eyes of players. It still has one of the biggest supporter bases in the world. But its 20 years of not winning that has made young players dream of playing for successful clubs.

Yes Liverpool needed to strengthen their squad this season otherwise we weren't going to cope with the amount of games. But whats the point of coping with the amount of games if we aren't even going to compete?? Football is still about the 11 players on the pitch and you put your best 11 out in any game you want to win. Suarez would have played every match next season (except for suspensions) because he was the best. 

Suarez is one of the top strikers in the world. He could pull a rabbit out of a hat with no help from the rest of the team. His free kicks were deadly. And one of the biggest things that everyone forgets is that he had more assists then anyone else in the premier league last season. He is leathal. He is uncontrollable. When the ball is at his feet people watch in awe wondering whats about to happen. Defenders were put in two minds.

So we replaced that with Remy? Lambart? I think not.
Lallana may be overpriced but he was less of a risk than Markovic.
I havent seen any footage showing why he is worth what we paid for him.

We need another goal scorer. If Sturridge gets injured. We are screwed.

The odds of us winning the champions league are slim at best. We can't compete with Madrid, Barca and Bayern.
I also doubt we are going to be competing for the premier league. 
Costa, Fabragas, Hazard.... Chelsea could run away with it.

We are now just playing to make top 4 again.

As I got closer more and more people passed by and I started to psych myself up to deal with a potential dead body. With every step I was visualising what would happen. 

I was quarter of the way there when suddenly a man walk past him and quickly tapped him on the shoulder. The body reared up, like the dead rising, his arms flopping around - clearly unresponsive from how long he'd been slumped over. The crowd of people quickly gave him a wider berth. 

I picked up my step and carried onto my bus stop. Passing through a brief stench of shit that the guy had - I assume he'd defecated when the guy touched his shoulder.

Probably a stupid analogy but I guess you can see my point. UK Dota is in desperate need of a consistent league or tournament format with decent incentives (lan finals, prizes) in order for it to grow. Not only would it create a competitive atmosphere within the upper echelon of the scene (providing heaps of motivation), it would add stability to the scene. Until that point, there will always be a skill cap and little room to grow from within the scene.

An active inhouse league would work wonders as it would allow for better networking within UK dota as well as a slightly higher rate of improvement etc, but it seems like that idea has failed to find a stable footing for whatever reason.

And as for the IRA and the troubles, for the *most* part they avoided indiscriminate targeting. Mostly their *modus operandi* was targeted killings and small scale bombings with a few notable exceptions like the Omagh bomb. With the exception of a few very blood years in the 1980s the fighting was fairly controlled. 

There is a huge scale of difference. It means every single residence, school, hospital etc. in Israel has to have air raid shelters or some plan in place in event of an attack, and that every single day Israelis have to stop their lives to run for cover - and sometimes when they come out there are a few less of them. In their mind they are in a war surrounded on all sides by people who want to see them wiped out and that's deeply ingrained following their diaspora after the holocaust.

How does someone become a suspected burglar?  

* Found in possession of stolen property?  Nope.
* Found in possession of house breaking equipment?  Nope.
* Known suspect wanted for previous crimes?  Nope.
* Seen entering or leaving a property?  Nope.

How does someone become a drug user/dealer?

* Being caught in possession of drugs?  CHECK!

There's nothing to suggest that the person was a burglar at all.  In fact, the only evidence of any wrong doing is possession of drugs (almost certainly cannabis or they would have mentioned CLASS A DRUGS!).  They also had cash on them which is not a crime, last time I checked.

It seems far more likely that the police suspected they were in fact a drug dealer (which is why they mentioned the cash).  There is no evidence presented that they were a violent person or presented a risk to the general public.  

If this is indeed the case, then there was no justification for sending an unaccompanied attack dog into someone's back garden.  The dog was clearly unaccompanied because a police dog is trained to obey instruction without question.  If the dog's handler had been present then the dog would never have attacked the woman, or would have stopped attacking the woman at a single command.  

Furthermore, police officers don't have police dogs riding around in their cars with them.  They would have had to call in a dog handler as part of an organised ""man hunt"".  They also sought the lady's permission to send the dog into her garden, so it wasn't a spur of the moment thing.

Based on the limited facts presented, it looks like this tragic accident occurred because of an inappropriate reaction by the police to a situation in which the public were in no danger.  By presenting the person as a ""suspected burglar"" (which may have been ""technically"" correct if he had broken and entered into a property by this point) they are increasing the perceived threat to the public so as to mitigate their actions.

To be fair to the police and the dog, the woman was 73 and at that age even minor injuries can have complications that lead to death.  It's quite possible that it was the kind of minor injury that a younger, healthier person would have endured with little more than a few stitches and some bruising. Old people are frail.  It sucks, but sometime they fall over and die, too.  It doesn't take much.

It's a tragic *accident*, and I have the greatest of sympathy for the woman's family and also the dog's handler.  The police aren't bad people (generally speaking) and I'm sure they also feel terrible about what has happened.  But in my opinion the (limited) facts suggest that they over-reacted and this contributed to the events that lead to the death of the woman.  

All in the name of the war on drugs.

The same is true here also, not all Craft Breweries are limited to localized distribution. Also consider our nation is massive, having localized production is desirable for many reasons, sustainability among them. 

&gt;The UK was doing craft beer before it was cool but there was no marketing

Of course you were; we're pups. But so were we, we just had a *very long* lapse into the kind of dregs that kept me on liquor for a long long time. 

&gt;there was no marketing. 

things are different here. criticize us for it, lol; doesn't matter. i love england but i don't fancy copying the place, square peg round hole. just because a thing is labelled and marketed doesn't mean it's worthless or inferior.

&gt;Craft on its own doesn't mean better,

*of course not* i would never pretend this was even approaching the case. I'm *quite* vocal (and due to the nature of the localization, often directly to the person who  created the beer) about certain beers that don't measure to a  standard i'd like my region to represent. I'm very proud of texas beer (since you so seem to loath the term, i'll just say what i say . . . beer), and yes there are lots of mediocre and even bad offerings, there are also plenty of 4.75/5 or better beers brewed not just in my megalopolis, but also Austin, Houston, and even the Hill country above Austin. 
&gt;I've had craft beers that taste like orange juice because the brewer obviously just used way to much hops.

That's a bit below the belt. That's just your palate; just because *you* don't like a heavily hopped beer, doesn't mean that others don't, and that it can't be rated an exceptional beer by a great many folk. I happen to prefer hoppier brews with a .93:1 hops to malt ratio or more, though I sense most of the beers I would relish, you would sneer upon and mock, but that's understandable.

edit : dumb yank comparing apples to oranges here, i'm talking about craft beer on *my* side of the pond, thought the OP was curious about *american* craft beer vs Real Ale, was not aware that there was a ""Craft Beer"" movement in the UK, I thought that was just . . .

Agreed, it's terrible, but there's a big difference between an elderly lady dying as the result of a dog *bite*, and being half eaten.

The woman wasn't *mauled* by the dog.  Police dogs don't maul people.  They bite them and hold onto them to stop them from running away.

The woman wouldn't have been in any position to put up a fight so the dog wouldn't have inflicted any more injury than was necessary to protect itself or members of its ""pack"" (i.e. the handler, police, etc).  

It's quite possible (but obviously we don't know for sure) that the injury was little more than a few teeth marks and some bruising.  But at 73, these little things can trigger more serious problems.  She died several days after the attack suggesting that it was secondary effects that finished her off (e.g. infection) rather than loss of blood or other immediate effects of the attack.

Of course, I'm hypothesising.  But I suspect this is the more likely scenario than ""half eaten"" (although I accept it's just a turn of phrase you used - not trying to be overly pedantic)

It's a tragic situation and certainly one that could have been avoided - the police should never have sent an unaccompanied attack dog into her garden unless there was a clear risk of danger to the public.",0,1406013030,null,0,false,0,cj48tx7,t3_2bbu2a,t1_cj48tx7,t1_cj3sbk7,null,1434835881,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

People have every right to be suspicious of those in government who have killed, and apparently not shown much genuine remorse.

However, whenever an organisation is often making complaints about other parties and their membership, it tends to be helpful if their own house is in order. In this case, every time they mention the 'murders in government', they're just going to get a finger pointed back at them ""but you've murders as members too"", adding to the criticism of certain bands carrying memorials for other killers.

A car running a red light was T-boned quite severely - the car ploughing into the other car's side was travelling in a 70km/h zone, so there was definitely severe injury involved there.

What did my dad, and most other cars stopped at the intersection do? Drove the fuck out of there before the intersection was blocked. I had to go to some effort to convince him to let me even use his mobile to call for an ambulance. I was truly disgusted by the weaseliness displayed that night.

I was about 10 cars back when a minibus got a tank-slapper on, swerved from side to side and finally flipped over. Poor OAP in the back was strangled by her seat belt at the bus rolled.

I stopped on the verge and ran to the scene, along with another guy from a car behind me, who stopped **behind** the accident. We did what we could for the poor occupants and tried to help.  
When the police arrived the scene was cordoned off etc, and in total I was there for about 2 hours talking through to various officers about what happened, walking the scene with photographers etc., when out of the blue a senior officer literally dragged me to one side and asked me why I hadn't been breathalysed yet, whereupon he did his best to imply that I was involved, and breathalysed me.  
Luckily there were enough other witnesses to prove that I wasn't involved, but just to make sure I don't try to help anyone again the police took photos of my car, checked the tyres against the skid marks, breathalysed me and cautioned me.

Guy who stopped behind was thanked for his assistance at the scene and told to go on his way.

I later appeared in coroners court for the poor OAP's inquest, where I was thanked by the coroner and the family for trying to help, but it felt like a pyrrhic victory.

true,Calmdownplease,lfc99,,"Nice discussion, a few additional thoughts from my side..

**1 Liverpool is no longer a ""big"" club:** I think there is some elements of truth to that. The fact of the matter is that we had a superlative last season and outperformed most expectations. However it was a long drought before that and that has impacted perceptions of the club. We absolutely have to compete this season and its almost essential that we qualify for CL again. Lifting our club is a process and not an event. 

However, having said that, the Liverpool brand is one of the biggest in the world, the passion of the fans is something that Chelsea and City money cannot buy and while we have faded, success will bring an aspiration to play for the club very quickly. It also helps that the league is the best in the world from a competitive stand point so a competitive team will draw talent.

**2 Not having signed a marquee player:** Non issue. We cannot compete with the really big money clubs, its a zero sum game and management are right to not chase huge names to the detriment of a team. Our geography doesnt help as well.

Stars are great and they sell jerseys but our edge should be to create stars rather than buy them. Rodgers has a skill set in this space and an eye for dormant talent. Final thought, depth was a real issue last season and will be a bigger one this season. Rather aim to spread the cash around and allow for rotation than chase a big name. 

**3 Repeating last seasons performance:** When we thrashed Arsenal 5-1 Luis was sitting in the stands cheering us on. Liverpool is not a club built around 1 person. Will we miss his contribution? Absolutely. Can we replace him? Not in one season. Will we move on and rise above the loss? Yes. Can we repeat last seasons performance? Only time will tell but I am confident.

**4 Lallana:** He may be slightly overpriced but he is absolute quality. For me what makes him a worthwhile transfer is his leadership quality and the fact that he stayed at So'ton for so long. He is exactly the sort of player I like seeing in the team. Quality, talent, loyalty and leadership. Thats worth the price.

**5 Defence:** Yes our defence last season was shit. We leaked goals and could blow a decent lead in 5 minutes. Only our goal scoring ability saved our asses and if have lost something there with Luis leaving then shoring up the defence is the best way to accommodate that loss. Lovren will help but we need to get a rotation for Johnson. 

The bottom line is that a resurgent Liverpool is bad news for Arsenal, Chelsea, Utd and City. There are only 4 CL slots and we are not the same as a Spurs or Everton. We are Liverpool and if we rise again we will knock one of then down hard.

Despite the long odds, what is worth doing is contacting customer services, ideally via the likes of Twitter or Facebook and explain it's your father's birthday (assuming that's why you're looking to get him the tickets) and just asking them what the best way is to get tickets for the game as a one off.

Since EE took over they've gone down the shitter.
They used to be pretty decent, hence my many years sticking with them.

But recently they can't help but fuck up, and the customer service team are either deaf, mentally handicapped (no offence to the mentally handicapped intended there) or doing their best attempt at being a complete and utter bunch of bastards.

They keep over charging my contract because they've got the prices all wrong. I don't know how, but they insist on charging me more than they should, even though my bill clearly shows no extra charges and shows what I should be paying. But when it comes to the bit where they are actually going to charge me, it's magically a few quid more.

I literally had to get one of their customer service people to work through the process of taking away 20% from my total cost to figure out what the bill is supposed to be without VAT. I had to explain the process of taking 20% off a bloody number to a fully grown person working in customer services.

He then offered me 2000 more minutes on my contract if I pay the extra. If I wanted the minutes I wouldn't have chosen this contract. So he finally agreed to take the money off. New bill came yesterday, nothing has changed.

My advice would be to see if the protection against mid-contract price increases stuff applies to your situation.

Gove tried to push the teaching of history towards a more celebratory narrative. But at least when I was at school, we were taught extensively about the British role in slavery, of Cromwell's atrocities in Ireland and the persecution of Catholics under Elizabeth. The problem with the history syllabus in this country is its focus on modernity- WW1, WW2, great depression and the Cold War.

Story time:

* We get a knock on the door at some ungodly hour of the night. It's a guy who's been severely baten up asking for help, but refusing an ambulance. I kept him talking while my mrs surreptitiously phoned 999. Police and ambulance turned up in about 10 minutes and escorted him away, the Police officers trying to persuade him to get treatment. His face had been used as a punching bag and he'd shat himself. No way I'm leaving someone in that state, no matter how much they say they don't want an ambulance.

* Another time, it's midnight and for some reason I had to pop out to the cashpoint a couple of streets away. At the end of the next road to ours, there's a man beating his girlfriend. She's on the floor, sobbing, he's standing over her, hissing vile stuff at her. I'm a wimp, so I knew I couldn't have fought him back like I'd want to, so instead, I stand directly inbetween the two of them, look the guy in the eye and ask ""You alright?"" He says yes, but I've made it clear his card's been marked and I'm willing to stop things going any further (yay for nonverbal communication). I walk off a few steps, look back at them and he's getting her to her feet. Maybe I didn't stop the whole beating, but I stopped it there and then, which is all anyone could have done at the time - especially someone three inches shorter and about 10 years more out of shape.

* WAiting at the bus stop with two other people - an old lady and another, younger woman (40's). Old lady faints and hits the floor in a heap. My mobile is crap and unreliable, so I ask the other lady if she has one I can use to call an ambulance. She is already backing off, bullshits me that her battery is dead and fucks off. Luckily, for once, my phone doesn't die on me and I call 999 (actually 112, remember it, people), get details as prompted by the operator - pulse, breathing rate, potted medical history, name, etc - before the ambulance turns up. Crew and lady thank me profusely, haven't seen her since, but I hope she was OK.

* (Edit: remembered another one) Old chap got cracked on the temple by a bus wing mirror, standing too close to the road at the lights. He's stumbling around, a good 50 people on a busy high street also see this happen and carry on right past, despite this happening right outside a Lloyds Chemist. I stop, ask him if he's OK, take a look at his head, check how many fingers he can see and make sure he goes to have a chat with the Pharmacist.

Bit shakey at first, but he was brilliant at the world cup. Hopefully he can break the chains of his first season and really push on to be a clinical centre figure for our back 4. I want him too, i really do, but he was too fragile last year at times.

There is that little worry that last season was our big chance. That it won't happen again.

But I think we need to give Rodgers some credit and trust.

Yes, he has enormous pressure to deal with this season - nobody expected us to go so close last season, and now that creates its own expectations. Teams will know that unless they play clever and cautiously, they could suffer an Arsenal/ Spurs-style Blitzkrieg. We can expect more Chelsea-style tactics: take a draw, hope for a mistake.

There is always concern when a hugely important player leaves, and lots of new players come in. But assuming it is like the Spurs situation is erroneous. There's no doubt that we'd have bought lots of players this summer whatever happened to Suarez. We had a poor defence and no cover anywhere. A paper-thin squad. So lots of new reecruits was always likely.

But of those, I think Lallana, Lovrens and possibly Markovic will be in the first XI, so it isn't going to mean a huge settling in period for most of them, as they know how we play, and they know the league well.",0,1406022030,null,0,false,0,cj4awzm,t3_2bdgyu,t1_cj4awzm,t3_2bdgyu,null,1434836896,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Mar 2014 - [Stitching-up claimants is all part of the job, says Jobcentre insider](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/stitching-up-claimants-part-job-says-3537051)

&gt;The man wishes to be anonymous but gave his details to IDS, DWP minister Esther McVey and Neil Couling, Head of Jobcentre Plus, who also attended the meeting.

&gt;“We were constantly told ‘agitate the customer’ and that ‘any engagement with the customer is an opportunity to ­sanction’,” he told them.

followed by:

&gt;He claimed managers fraudulently altered claimants’ records, adding: “Managers would change people’s appointments without telling them.

Rumours have it he'll be making a £5 million move, a first team keeper with a couple of seasons under his belt in the premiership should be commanding more money than this. HOWEVER, I might get a bit of hate for saying this but I haven't seen an awful lot of ""The Cat"" for the last season and a half. He has seemed very sluggish and a lot of 50/50 shots he will stand there for, unless he is 100% that he can save them. Looking at it from the perspective of brining in an in-form keeper who has had a good run in the FA Cup as of late seems to be a solid option.

From his stand point at this moment, the move makes no sense. He'll be on the bench for the majority of his games. But, Lloris' stock has just sky rocketed after a good world cup and a decent season in the premiership, no doubt playing behind a solid defence this season will drive his price up that much more. I think this time next season there will be a big money big for him from PSG, which would make sense as they have to have a certain number of French players in the team and he's a top class keeper. It's at that point he'll be first choice. They're just covering their bases, before this transfer happens.

Treat it like any other interview. It might sound obvious but choose a quiet location where you won’t be disturbed and make sure your phone is fully charged. Use the fact they can't see you! 




Don’t surround yourself with notes that could distract you but have index cards prepared with bullet points to the most obvious questions such as tell me about yourself, what have you got to offer, why you, why them, strengths and weaknesses and relevant achievements.




If you feel it will help you get in the right mind set, dress as if it’s a face to face interview, sit behind a desk rather than slumped on a sofa and stand during the conversation as it helps to change your tone of voice. Don’t forget to smile, it comes across even if the other person can’t see you.  getrealcareers.com

true,GavChap,cnty-uk,Not in Hertfordshire,"Depends how you look at it. I'm currently paying around £900pcm for a mortgage on a 3 bed semi, my previous place - a 2 bed flat - I lived went on the rental market recently for £895pcm.

Currently my interest rate on my mortgage is about 4.7%, house prices are rising at 7% or so in my area, if that continues, when I finish paying my mortgage, my house will be worth more than the total sum I paid off including interest.

Advantages of buying: 

* It's yours, you can do whatever you like, paint the walls lime green if you want, need extra room, extend.
* It's an investment in land and property, though like all investments there are risks

Disadvantages of buying: 

* If things go wrong, you have to get it fixed, however... There are 'home emergency' insurances available to fix plumbing, electrics, etc, and buildings and contents will take care of a lot of things. On my home insurance it was about £3 a month extra to get home emergency cover, and we've used it twice already for plumbing problems.
* It's expensive at the beginning. Nobody tells you just how much it'll cost, yes you need a deposit (5%-10%) and the fees, etc, but then there's the first mortgage payment which may be a lot more than you imagined as it includes interest from the day you completed.

Whereas if you have a mortgage, you're at least contributing towards the ownership of the property and you have the ability to redecorate, renovate and resell.

Though, the option a lot of younger people choose is thus:

Buy a place.

Live in it for a bit.

Rent it out at more than your mortgage pcm.

Continue to live in other rented accommodation where you have the freedom of moving around if you want.


You now have someone else paying off your mortgage, and you're earning money from it (assuming agency fees etc. are over-covered by the profit you're taking from renting it).
After a while, congratulations, you now own property, which has probably gone up in value over the years.

Note that you don't have to pay off a mortgage from your own pocket before you can sell.

Basically the promisor promises to do something IF the promisee fulfills the promisor's terms. In Carlill v Carbolic Smokeball Company the judges noted that usually promises in ads are 'mere puffs'; e.g. the ad for Red Bull claims to 'give you wings' but this is obviously not promise and therefore you cannot sue Red Bull based on the fact that the product has not, in fact, given you wings. The ad in Carlill promised to give £100 to anyone to contracted influenza after using the product. When the claimant got influenza and attempted to sue it was argued that the promise to give £100 was a 'mere puff' and therefore not an offer. However it was held to amount to a unilateral offer 'to all the world' as the company stated they had put £1000 in the bank specifically to honour their promise. This action suggested that they would act upon their promise to anyone who fulfilled their terms (i.e. use the product and catch influenza nonetheless). To sum up the unilateral offer was IF you use the product and catch influenza, we will give you £100. Arguably in the case above, you could argue that there is a unilateral offer; IF you email me before christmas, I will give you a discount but there has to be something extra to suggest this promise was to be acted upon.

I'm not convinced that people who pirate games are people living in poverty, struggling to scrape together enough cash for their next meal.

This is true. Stevie is such an absolute all-rounder, we sometimes take him for granted. 


At international level, he was often forced to sacrifice for the sake of the team. He was consigned to LM for years during Erikson's tenure. After that, during Mclaren and Capello's time, Stevie had to play behind Lampard in the middle. Hodgson took it a step further and made him a DM.


At club level, Stevie never had the luxury of being surrounded by players of the level his peers enjoyed.


Despite all that, Stevie still managed to have a legendary playing career.

Yelled at people to get back from the area and not crowd him so he didn't panic, told them to get one of their tour operators and preferably a senior one at that. Took my jacket off (I was wearing snowboard trousers and baselayers and sober so was warm enough and able to sit on the floor) and got it around him, rolled him into the recovery. Got some tissues, stemmed the bleeding from his head.

Discovered NOBODY spoke french. So I had to ring the ambulance number, asked if they spoke english, they didn't. So explained to them that I'm not a native speaker and if we could keep to yes/no and number questions and explain things I don't get with descriptions, then i'll see what I can do.

Used broken french to explain situation, ""We are outside such and such Bar, I don't know the street. He has fallen. He has a poorly head. He is like he is sleeping"" They asked me all sorts of questions and I did ok, is he breathing? fast or slow? Heart beats per minute? Bleeding? etc.

Got one of my holiday reps and one of his to act as witnesses that I wasn't robbing the poor kid when I took out his wallet to give them his name, DOB, EHIC number (allows some free healthcare) and medical insurance paperwork.

Once he came round, I talked to him, kept him awake, teased him so he'd swear at me, told him not to move, just to stay put please.

His reps came to find me and told me the next day that he'd had a severe concussion and his body temp had dropped and if it wasn't for my quick thinking and broken french, he would've had hypothermia too as he was close to it from lying on the ice with a head wound for 5-10mins and there was a high chance he would've become another brit ski trip statistic.",0,1406027395,null,0,false,0,cj4c0b7,t3_2bc8k6,t1_cj4c0b7,t3_2bc8k6,null,1434837667,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Elements of the IRA didn't believe in a two state solution or the Irish Free State as a stop-gap measure at all and took up arms against their old brothers in arms in Eire. They utterly destroyed the Irish economy which made the burden of debt too much to bear. Thus they ceded territory in exchange for it being written off. Eventually the Irish pro-government forces won that civil war, acknowledged the two Ireland's and within 20 years had attained all of the goals the counter-revolutionaries wanted such as total independence except a united Ireland.

The unofficial IRA then steadily escalated its involvement in the North to forceably bring Northern Ireland under a Southern Irish government that no longer even wanted one nation. The Brits and Irish government even had bloody joint operations against the IRA fuck sake.

It's also worth noting that Northern Ireland opted out of the Irish Free State within a day of its creation as it was legally allowed to do so. Moreover, British troops were originally sent to places like Belfast to *protect* the Catholic minority from unionist extremists. It grew into an occupying force in the end. There were plenty of Catholics in the British army.

There are no simple answers to Ireland. It is messy. It is bloody. It is senseless and it is a shameful stain both to the Irish and the British.

It is not the same conflict as the Irish revolution with clear battle lines. The IRA in Northern Ireland fought for unachievable goals that even the state some of them fought for didn't even believe in. They used genuine civil rights concerns of Catholics in Northern Ireland as an excuse to blow up innocent men, women and children.

The entire bloody conflict spawned from infighting and compromise as well as the right of self-determination of those in the North.

It should just be a job, albeit with insane salaries. You should agree to (like teachers) give six months notice so that a replacement can be found in time. There should be no fee, no buy and sell, no restrictions other than the notice period and possibly some cup-tied stuff.

If you really want to maximise your time there I'd say try and stop overnight in Helmsley, it'd be worth the money you'd be spending on taxis. Spend a morning in Whitby, get on the NYM railway, stop off a couple of times on the way back to see the sights and then there's the 128 bus you can take from Pickering to Helmsley. Off the top of my head I can't think of the last bus time but it's easy to find out, they do stop pretty early though.


Helmsley has lots of little pubs that have b&amp;b rooms above them (Black Swan is the only one I've been to personally but it was lovely) and plenty of places for dinner. The Sunday can easily be spent at Riveaulx Abbey (good choice!) then get the 128 bus back toward Scarborough,  get off at Thornton Dale and change to the Coastliner to Whitby which will take you back over the moors.


Just a suggestion but it'd help maximise your time there since you only have two days - just be very very careful, the steam line is more for tourists rather than going places so can be temperamental, and the bus services around the area are notorious for being late or just not turning up. Don't however rely on taxis, there is literally no taxi ranks anywhere and you'd have to book a cab in advance over the phone for the distance of journey you're planning, plus it'd be extortionate!

I think a lot of us City fans would agree that he is a fantastic defender with potential to possibly be one of the best around. He made his debut for us in the Champions League at the age of 19 against **Real Madrid** and he looked completely focused and was one of the best players on the pitch for us that night.

The trouble at the moment is that I think it may be a toss up on who we want to keep, Rekik or Nastasic. Personally, I would prefer to keep Nastasic because he has already proved himself to be honest but they are both extremely bright talents.

Secondly, Demichelis doesn't have long left I'd think. Once he is gone it opens up another space. Kompany, Mangala, Nastasic and Rekik? That is something I would love to see. It wouldn't make sense to keep Demi and lose one of our extremely bright young talents, especially after spending huge money to bring another extremely bright young talent.

Banning female genital mutilation in all its forms smacks of cultural superiority at least, and racism at worst.

There's obviously a clear cultural/quasi religious need to perform a procedure of some kind on a young girl's vagina.  I totally agree that most forms are horrific; however SOME forms involve a simple nick/slight cut of the labia- something no more harmful than male circumcision.

Why do we insist on banning all forms, rather than working with communities to ensure a safe form of FGM is practiced; similar to male circumcision, which is already legal and seen as totally acceptable.

Procedures exist that can satisfy the cultural need whilst at the same time being safe.

&gt;Other Operators therefore pay some 18.43 times the rate paid by Openreach for link fibre on a FAC, and some 49.98 times that on a LRIC basis. If BT’s measure of link fibre was per fibre pair, then the difference would be 37 times and 100 times respectively.

[Source](http://br0kent3l3ph0n3.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/how-bt-scores-in-the-fibre-rates-wars/)

Because of that gigantic tax loophole (Provided kindly by the Valuation Office Agency) BT have effectively muscled out the competition for fibre connectivity.

In addition, OFCOM has regulated last-mile connectivity so that ISPs are overpaying BT to the tune of £180 million a year which it is using to artificially lower it's prices, driving competition out of the market.

We can only speculate, but it *could* be several puncture wounds resulting from a single bite/hold.  I imagine the police would downplay the injuries and the press would exaggerate them, so it's hard to know where the truth of the situation lies.

I'm a dog owner, and a previous neighbour of mine trained police/security dogs, so I admit I'm slightly biased in favour of the dog.  If the dog was allowed to get in a position where the old lady could came to harm then I think it's more likely to be the fault of the handler than the dog.  But like I say, we can only speculate.

The reason why copying is not stealing is repeated so often is that:

1. People keep trying to say they're the same

2. They're not the same.

Theft involves somebody dishonestly appropriating the possession of another with the intent to permanently deprive them of it.

Insofar as copyright is property (which is purely for legal convenience), it's the *exclusive right* granted by copyright law that constitutes the property.

So the analogy with theft fails:

1. Because you're not appropriating the exclusive right. You're not saying ""I own the copyright now"".

2. You're not depriving the owner of the exclusive right. When a work covered by copyright is copied, the owner still owns the copyright, and they still own their copy of the work. They are still able to exercise *all* of the rights granted to them.

You can get hours of driving experience without having to pay someone £25+ an hour. Go to a car park/quiet place and night and practice if you can. 

Once you're capable and have got some seat time, take some lessons to learn how to pass the test. Learning how to drive and how to pass the driving test are two completely different things.  

As far as getting a car, look at used Hondas. Great little cheap cars which have smaller engines and low cost insurance (the smaller the engine the lower the insurance should be). I recently found some real bargains on autotrader for £500-£1000. 

If you have the option of doing your own maintenance, pick up a Haynes manual and change your own oil, fluids, brakes etc. Will save you a fortune and is relatively easy on smaller Japanese cars. Garages can really rip you off (not always and not all places but a lot can) so always google the problem before taking it to a garage as it could just be a simple fix. 

Tax and insurance will be the biggest costs, play around on a compare website and see if you can reduce the price by adding named drivers (doesn't always work), reducing the value of the car and miles traveled per year to the bare minimum. Best option is to go for a cheap run around car and this will help reduce all of your other costs such as parts/insurance etc.

If I am the CEO of MegaGameCorp, and I spend £10m producing a game, and I sell 10million games for £10 each, I make £100m from sales, or £90m profit.

If 100million people can't afford £10 (10 times the actual number of sales!), and they pirate the game, I have lost no money. I have still made my £100m from sales, I just didn't gain any money from the 100million people who pirated.

In order to say someone has lost money, you would need to agree that a certain % of those 100million pirates would have bought the game if it could not be pirated.

Now this will evidently be the case, there will always be people who will get something for free they could otherwise afford. However, there will also be a large number of people who genuinely would not spend money on the game (either because they can't or because they wont).

I don't buy the ""I try before I buy"" thing, because I've only ever subsequently bought a game I pirated because I either wanted to play features like multiplayer, or because it became a load cheaper later down the line.

Depending on how many people you think are ""potential"" customers that would pay if you prevented piracy, depends on how cost effective it is and how much damage it is doing to game developers. In my opinion, poor quality 'blockbuster' games is harming the big game studios more than piracy is. 

EA drags their name through the mud year after year while beating the final bits of profit out of a dead horse before moving onto the next franchise. If I was running EA I'd be more worried about my company's perception then boosting sales by a totally unquantifiable amount.

I'm sorry - why? Just like male circumcision, a practice which **might** have a [medical requirement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision#Medical_indications), there appears to be NO reason to cut females, beyond a ""belief that girls must be “cut” in order to prepare them for marriage.""

Can you give me ANY reason whatsoever that could even attempt to convince me that this is an acceptable practice? Just because something's a ""tradition"" does NOT necessarily make it right. There were deep cultural reasons why women weren't allowed to vote in the UK until 1914 - I think it unlikely that you would suggest that we should, perhaps, for the sake of ""cultural need"", reverse such a decision.

I can't defend male circumcision, either. Messing with anyone's sexual organs without their own permission is wrong.

We could get into all sorts of arguments about ""cultural/quasi religious needs"" - how about the ""need"" for rather older men to be able to wed a young girl.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; The loss of potential income is highly debatable. If the choice which so many people are describing is between not having something and pirating it, saying that people should not have it because that's the morally right thing to do, then there is no loss of potential income.

Right, I was speaking more generally there than just this thread. Many people who pirate would, presumably, not buy the thing were they to not pirate it. Some already own it. Many don't and wouldn't buy it. There's lots of tables of numbers on this topic that generally disagree, but it's quite rare to see anyone try to claim that the proportion of people who would buy the thing were they to have not pirated is negligibly small.

&gt; The only people really effected by loss of income caused by the surge in piracy are from the old economy. 

No they aren't - lots of people are embracing modern distribution methods and still finding their stuff pirated. All the Netflix-only stuff is available pirated, is Netflix's model now ""the old economy""? 

&gt; Being uncomfortable with change entrenches viewpoints people see as morally correct. The situation is beyond where those morals still apply.

I'm not sure what you're getting at here; computers and the Internet allow for progress at such a pace that we have no need for morals?

You ideally want to introduce them to the characters as they exist in the new series. Bit difficult to do that for the 12th Doctor. So introduce them to Clara and the Paternoster gang.

If you were going to show them four episodes, I'd suggest

- *The Snowmen*
- *The Bells of Saint John*
- *The Crimson Horror*
- *The Time of the Doctor*

That's two introductory-Clara episodes, two Paternoster gang episodes, and one episode to explain why the 11th Doctor won't be on-screen in the upcoming series.

I don't know how I'd cut that down to two episodes. Probably stick with the first two.

What a load of bollocks. Games, movies and music are not too expensive. Nor are they too difficult to access. Steam, iTunes, netflix, spotify, amazon.  Not exactly difficult to use. And spotify hardly breaks the bank at £9 for unlimited use. Netflix a whopping £6 a month. Or you can pay per track on iTunes. I don't pirate music any more because of spotify.

I pirate stuff simply because I can get things without paying for them. I have plenty of money, but if I can download photoshop for free, why would I pay for it? That's just illogical. If piracy became impossible tomorrow, there's an increased likelihood that I would actually buy it. I wouldn't buy EVERYTHING I download for free, but I'd certainly buy more.

Barbaric savages. 

&gt;are they cultural or religious?

Both. Islam ""recommends"" it, and sees it as favourable, but does not strictly require it. However, it does require men to have it done.

It is based in sexism, to keep women pure and stop them fucking around until marriage. And often it is the older women in society who push it onto the younger girls.

&gt;How should society respond

By calling it what it is. Barbaric and disgusting behaviour which has NO part in the UK in 2014

&gt;what should be the punishment

Jail. Massive fines. Deportation.

&gt;how do we help the people already affected

Medical consultation. Psychological help if needed.

&gt;How do we change attitudes towards the practices in the communities that it is performed in?

Through ruthlessly applying the law. Hammering down on this practice with harsh penalties applied to anybody and everybody involved with FGM. That sends a clearer message than anything else. The people doing this sort of thing KNOW it's unacceptable. That's why they do it in secret in the UK, or fly the girls abroad to have it done.

According to the most repuatable source in all existence, Wikipedia, 'a monopoly exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity. Monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service and a lack of viable substitute goods. The verb ""monopolise"" refers to the process by which a company gains the ability to raise prices or exclude competitors. In economics, a monopoly is a single seller. In law, a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power, that is, the power to charge high prices. Although monopolies may be big businesses, size is not a characteristic of a monopoly. A small business may still have the power to raise prices in a small industry or market.'

Right now, on my computer, I have one game I didn't pay for, and I've played once (and not enjoyed) and all the other games are either ones I bought, ones I bought but lost the disc for (older games, like Galactic Battlegrounds), or ones I got for free off steam (Portal).

The point I'm trying to make is that pirating a game doesn't necessarily mean the developer makes no profit on or gets no sale.  
While some people will pirate and never give the developer money, having a game pirated also increases it's availability. I pirated games that I would never have gone out and bought in a shop, but due to playing them for free to begin with I purchased the game.

I'm not trying to claim that ""the proportion of people who would buy the thing were they to have not pirated is negligibly small"". There will always be people who would rather not pay for things they can afford. Would most of these people steal things from shops rather than pay for them? A small number would, yes, but probably a lot fewer than the people pirating without 'needing' to.

Netflix are certainly finding their stuff pirated. Do you hear them complaining about it? Do Netflix campaign to have file sharing sites blocked by ISPs? I seriously doubt it. They understand that piracy is *inevitible*. When a method is found to reproduce a product, without significant (actually for a vanishingly small) cost, then that method will inevitably be used to reproduce that product and to share it. If we could replicate cars using just free energy then people would do that, and they would find ways to not have to pay.

What netflix recognises is that people do value their products and are prepared to pay for them, and that if they price their products correctly and make receiving it easy enough, then people will pay them enough for it to be profitable. They make it just difficult enough to pirate that some people value the convenience of their service over the free one. You can also bet that they factor piracy in. The extended reach that piracy gives them has a huge impact for their brand. House of Cards was seen by so many people as a result of piracy, which was a massive stream of advertising for their brand.

&gt;computers and the Internet allow for progress at such a pace that we have no need for morals?

No. Computers and the internet have changed the world so much that a lot of the morals people apply to the real world no longer fit. When products can be infinitely replicated, stealing is no longer the same thing. It creates the need for a totally different way of looking at digital products, and a different moral landscape. The transactional model of the physical economy does not apply, and I think the moral outrage surrounding piracy is due to an inability to adapt to this new reality.",0,1406032176,null,0,false,0,cj4d9vt,t3_2bdnb2,t1_cj4d9vt,t1_cj4cuci,null,1434838464,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; Now this will evidently be the case, there will always be people who will get something for free they could otherwise afford. However, there will also be a large number of people who genuinely would not spend money on the game (either because they can't or because they wont).

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"Thank you.  As you correctly point out, the article says she was bitten several times and not mauled, or half-eaten.

The injuries can be certainly be quite nasty, but they look [like this](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73096000/jpg/_73096418_doginjury1.jpg) and are nothing like the kind of  dog maulings where people get their faces torn off.  Police dogs are trained to apprehend suspects and hold onto them, not to scratch or tear at flesh (the definition of mauling), and certainly not to eat (or half eat) the suspect.

To most people this kind of injury wouldn't be life threatening.  According to [this report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-28341919) the woman was described as ""poorly"" upon admission to hospital which indicates that her injuries were not serious or life-threatening at the time.  That gives further credence to the fact that she may have died from secondary infection, heart attack, stroke etc., as a result of the attack.

This doesn't diminish from the fact that she shouldn't have been bitten.  Police dogs are well-trained but they're dangerous animals (and trained to be dangerous).  The do bite innocent people, especially when they are released by their handlers to go chase someone.  According to [this BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25883238) there were 150 cases reported last year, including a child of 10.

That's why I question the wisdom of allowing a police dog loose in an urban environment when there are old ladies present.  I think the handler or officer in charge is to blame, not the dog which is just doing what it's been trained to do - bite people.  It's like calling in the armed police - you should have a good reason to put the public (and suspect, who is innocent until proven guilty) at risk if you're going to have people with guns or dogs with sharp teeth in people's gardens.

Chasing down someone for a minor drug offence isn't a good enough reason in my opinion.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;So what if they're released every week?

Then it makes it harder for a child to deal with getting one everyone three or four months.

&gt;How does that entitle you to obtain more of them than you can afford? 

For a child, that's easy.

&gt;It all goes back to my original point, which is that these kids have a misplaced sense of entitlement.

I'd say it's the Electronic Arts and the Sony's that have a misplaced sense of entitlement. Games back in the 8-bit days were £5 each. The games market is now bigger than the movie and music industries combined. But hey, that's not the games companies becoming stupidly greedy, it's children developing a 'misplaced sense of entitlement'.

&gt;You do not deserve games simply because someone is releasing a lot of them.

You do not deserve to tease children with something they can't afford on a weekly basis on the presumption that they have the spending power of adults.

&gt;There is no fundamental human right to the latest CoD title or whatever.

No, there isn't. But badger a child with it for long enough, and they'll find a way to get it for free. Stop thinking like an adult, because this issue has arisen from the EA's and the like asserting that it's OK to treat children as such.

&gt;Well, I did when I was a kid, so that's one.

I guess there's no problem, then. When I was a kid, games were £5 or £10; I've seen nothing in the past twenty years to justify why they can't be that price now (in fact, the evidence all but insists they should be - how big is the games industry these days?)

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"&gt;I really don't understand why we have this obsession with buying houses. I believe most other countries just rent. 

Because there is something to be said for owning your own home and not paying rent which just makes someone else richer just so you can have a roof over your head.

""most other countries just rent"" is a load of bollocks, most likely said by a landlord somewhere. You can look up the home ownership rates in Europe. The UK is near the bottom of the list.

The ideal is to own your own home. Renting is just a second class alternative for people who are unable to buy. If the world was a fairer place we could all own our own homes. But we can't. So that's the alternative.

17% isn't worth thinking about as if it happened you'd have bigger problems (like being able to get food to worry about).

At this point I did what I should have done in the first place and downloaded the relevant episodes instead of trying to re-rip them with all the right subtitle/codec/audio options.  The money is no problem.  I'm happy to pay for good quality content, and in this case, already had.  But none of the content providers seem willing to come anywhere close to competing with the convenience of torrenting. 

I object to piracy on principle - it's a matter of honour, like standing your round in the pub.  I don't want to rip anyone off or have the movie studio executives go without their cocaine and hookers, or whatever it is that they lavish their money on.

But I also object to being ripped off myself.  Some films I've got on VHS, DVD and Blu-Ray.  I've paid for the pieces of plastic and I've paid for the content, several times over.  I don't have any qualms about downloading a movie instead of spending half an hour trying to find the relevant piece of plastic in a box in the loft only to find that the DVD player no longer works or being forced to sit through the same adverts for the nth time.

Anyway, I downloaded season 4 of GoT because, like you say, there was no chance of waiting until the DVD is released (February 2015) without hearing spoilers.  But I'll probably buy it anyway, just so I don't feel bad.  But they could have my money now if they wanted it and save themselves the trouble of messing around with bits of plastic and boxes that have to be physically transported around the world.

Is the only reason you think FGM should be banned that the child is not able to consent? In which case you would be right to want to ban it, as that is really the only thing that is the same between the two, and you might also want to consider banning parents from piercing their young children's ears.  

But are there other reasons that should be taken into account as well. Pain, the ability to enjoy sex, the cultural reasons why it might be done, all of there things differ between the two practices, and when you compare everything you end up with two very different practices that exist for very different reasons. Many people, including myself, will still in the end come to the conclusion that male circumcision is wrong, and the practice probably should not be allowed.

&gt;The main barrier to condemning male circumcision is that it is ingrained into western culture through the large Jewish and muslim communities that are already here, and its acceptance as the norm in most of North America.

The main barrier to condemning male circumcision on Reddit in my opinion seems to be that there actually aren't many stories about male circumcision being a problem. That is what frustrates a lot of people when the posts about male circumcision start on FGM posts.

The castle is also very cool, but a bit on the expensive side, and I've never been to the camera obscura (also on the expensive side I believe) but I've heard it's worth a visit.

Other than these, you can visit Holyrood Palace where the royal family stay when they're in Edinburgh, climb the Scott Monument for a phenomenal view over the city centre, visit the Scottish Parliament (which is also free I think) and go to Dynamic Earth, which is a really cool museum about geology and how Scotland's natural landscape was formed. There's loooooads more places as well. There's also a lot to be said for just wandering around the city, since most of the city centre is a UNESCO world heritage site and is full of quality shops, restaurants, pubs etc, or going and sitting in one of the millions of parks we have - if it's a sunny day you can be guaranteed to have an interesting time chilling in the meadows with all the hippies ahaha. If you're an active person there's also the 7 hills to go up, all of which are easy to get to by bus, or you can take a trip out to the Pentland hills just outside the city, again reachable by bus.

For day trips outside the city you can easily get the train to Glasgow, Scotland's biggest city, which is completely different to Edinburgh. Definitely not as pretty as Edinburgh, and less touristy, but still a really cool city, the West End around the University is very, very nice to cruise around, and the University itself is [pretty stunning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_glasgow#mediaviewer/File:University_of_Glasgow_Gilbert_Scott_Building_-_Feb_2008-2.jpg). If you want to go somewhere smaller you can take the train in the other direction and go to North Berwick, a town on the beach to the East of Edinburgh, or to somewhere in Fife like St Andrews.

If you want to go further afield it's pretty easy to get up to the highlands from Edinburgh via the train or bus. The problem is then getting from a town in the Highlands to places you might actually want to visit - public transport is very limited in the Highlands since it's so remote. If you want to go independently your best bet would be to rent a car, although like I said there's loads of companies in Edinburgh who tours of the highlands and go to places like [Eilean Donan castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilan_donan#mediaviewer/File:Eilean_Donan_Castle_Panorama.jpg), [The Isle of Skye](http://www.skye-media.com/images/HomeJan12%20LS.jpg) and [Loch Ness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_ness#mediaviewer/File:Loch_Ness_0406.JPG).

If we got relegated I would not be able to watch games at all since I am in the United States and The Championship does not get broadcast here. Even then there are only a few games a week that make it to TV in the UK as well. If you cant make it to a game in the lower division how do you follow the team? Radio? CHeck the scores in the paper the next day? Check the official website or some other site? The team Twitter? Facebook?

I didnt know we were having a pissing contest to see who had experience the lowest lows that the team has been through in it history. It seems that is something that gets brought up by the natives all the time when talking about how serious of a fan foreigners are. Back when I became a fan the only channel on TV that showed EPL games was Fox Soccer CHannel and they only showed five games a weekend. Do you think that City were ever shown? Rarely, unless they were one of the morning or evening games on Sunday it was all the top teams all the time. So I turned to finding live streams, like the sort that are posted in Wiziwig these days. This was back when I was living in California and was still in High School so I didnt have anything going on on the weekends. I wake up at 5:45 in the morning so that I can wake up properly, get some coffee and maybe something to eat. I had to get on the computer a bit early as well since often times I would spend a good amount of time searching for a watchable stream. My criteria for watchable was that I can see where the ball is and I can tell the two teams apart, as a result I have watched many games that were the video quality was worse than being filmed on a potato(like watching legos) and a lot of times it was in a different language. I have watched a good amount of Russian broadcasts and even a few Arabic broadcasts in my time. Then they were good enough to be on TV every week. I am still living in California so I wake up a little before kickoff get a coffee and maybe something to eat and then tune in on TV. I missed every midweek game since I was in school until 3:30 and had to drive about an hour home, these games started at 3pm back then. I followed the teams twitter account so that I can get live updates to what was going on during these games. Having the tweets text messaged to my phone so that I can sneak a peak at it during the last half an hour of school. Now I live in Kentucky on the east coast and games kickoff at 10am but I cant watch them live since I have to work so I download a broadcast first thing when I get home from work.

&gt; You cite handling the loss to Wigan as though that means you've stuck with the club through hard times. We were in a cup final for fucks sake. We've already had to beat some of the best teams in the country just to get there. We're already doing better than we've done in the last 30 years.

I cite that as a comparison between newer fans and older(yet still new fans) reactions to that result. My reaction was that I was disappointed that we lost to a team that we should have beaten but what I took away from it was that we had been in a cup final which is a lot more than what has ever happened for City. I know the history a bit, I personally do some research on new things that I take an interest in. Dont hate people who do not look back to where the team came from, they are building and experiencing their own history. Just like you never experienced anything before you were born and have built up years of experienced history. I feel that you are going to have a negative response/reaction to what I am about to share since you seem to have a strong dislike for foreign fans but I am going to share anyway. When we won the League back in 2012 I cried a bit. Not because it was an especially emotional moment for me(it was a bit) but more because I know the history. Everyone in the stadium standing for the final fifteen minutes shocked at how we were likely to lose the game and the title. Then everything turns on its head and agony which City supporters have grown accustomed to experiencing turns to ecstasy. People rush the pitch after the final whistle as a generation worth of disappointment and hardship is melted away and released. Those two guys holding the sign saying ""not in my lifetime"". I cried because of how much it meant to all of the old fans like yourself. I was happy that all of the hardship that you guys throw out whenever you try to say that you are a more passionate fan than me was relieved. Watching the final minutes of the promotion playoff against Gillingham also has the same effect on me.  


&gt; The fact that you no longer bother to watch a club you follow just because they lose alot is absurd.

Everything has an opportunity cost. For the last half of the season, since I had watched the first half there were other things that were more valuable for me to do. I would rather sleep so that I was not tired when I had to wake up early for work, or I had to do some school work for college. It is a bit difficult to say that getting a degree so that I dont have to work on the weekends at Walmart is more important than 80+ hockey games a season. I still check scores and watch highlights when I have the time to do so. Just because I dont watch them at the moment does not mean that I am not a serious supporter.

If you are just making minimum wage on those fares, you are complete failure and should try something else.

What is far, far more likely, is that many of the cash fares are simply not declared.

I can not possibly conceive how a licensed London Taxi driver would make so little as you suggest.  I can tell you from the places I've normally found myself needing a cab from, they won't have been waiting long for a fare, normally I've had to wait a while.

This is included in ""I spend £10m producing the game"". Don't quibble about the figures as they are simply illustrative. A company produces a game which makes them X amount of profit per game, 1million game pirates does not mean X multipled by 1million is being lost.

&gt;But if you fail to treat such actions at criminal, or at least a civil wrong, then those who are willing to pay would legitimately wonder why they should bother. The law has no capacity to distinguish between those who would have paid if piracy was not available, and those who wouldn't.

They are treated that way.

If game companies are informed of game pirates (by the general public) they will sue them in a civil (not criminal) suit as you are using their software without a licence.

ISPs have already said they will inform people that their actions are wrong.

I'm sure you probably break the law on a daily basis, everyone does. If there is anyone who never breaks a law I've yet to meet them, remembering that speeding, swearing in public, causing offence, assault etc are all easier to ""commit"" then common sense would imply.

There are 70 million people in the UK who break laws on a daily basis, is this really one that requires undue attention from our government and the police force? Is this and issue that needs money over others? It seems highly likely that this should be the priority of our government, our public services, or the game companies.

&gt;Given the sales of many of these blockbusters there must be many who do not share this opinion of yours.

Given the fact that less consumers are pre-ordering games (which is fantastic for the company's cash flow) , less consumers are buying games on their release days (compare say Halo 3 to Halo 4, CoD 5 to the latest etc) they would be daft not to worry about it.

The fact they are worried about it is evidenced in things like F2P games, which don't require initial spending to attract customers. ",0,1406039013,null,0,false,0,cj4g2b9,t3_2bdnb2,t1_cj4g2b9,t1_cj4d9yz,null,1434839761,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;XGPON can do 10Gbit down, 2.5 up or something like that. Not bad at all, and it's possible that new improvements can improve that even more and will just need to replace the equipment at both ends.

So it's half as complex as active, but with more restricted range. XGPON is then shared out to how many nodes? Last I checked it was 128 per node but that's variable depending on how BT feel about it. That 2.5gbit/s upload then goes down to 20mbit if everyone is using it (vanishingly rare, but possible). To me it seems silly to be spending all this money and getting something which is marginally better than FTTC under bad conditions. ""Don't half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing"" springs to mind.

There is also the very strong argument that BT want to continue restricting upload to retain the extremely lucrative leased line market. You don't just want people to have cheap access to really fast internet when you can artificially restrict support and make money off it.

&gt;Is there any active CPE that wouldn't mean deploying a noisy Cisco router with expensive line cards in houses? 

Depends how fast you want to go. There are plenty of devices that can handle 1Gbit/s of throughput which work passively. Cost might be an issue but basically the saving comes from not having more devices where the splitters are.

&gt;Plus you eliminate the need to have any powered equipment in the street or delicate electronics in street cabinets. Just some fibre and a splitter. 

Ideally yes. However you've basically traded off all the benefits of fibre to get something which acts like copper.

I think that when western countries make decisions on cultural practices like this they take into account the cultural reasons for the procedure. It's the only explanation I can think of why the two are treated so differently. 

With FGM there are no positive cultural reasons for the practice, only negative ones, so it is banned, with MC, there are positive reasons for it to be done in some countries, so the intent isn't as bad as it is with FGM. 

That's my theory anyway, whether it is a good reason to allow the procedure is another question. 

&gt;But is it cultural practices I'm thinking of enforcing - or a human right not to be operated on unnecessarily as a child?

The WHO says for certain that FGM is a breach of a girls human rights, but there seems to be a lot of confusion over whether MC breaches the child's human rights.

What he ignored was that there were many other sporting events going on that day, that week and that month, as well as numerous other forms of entertainment competing for his money.

In the narrow sense he was correct, but in the wide sense he was wrong. Ticketmaster could not charge what it liked for the event, because other similar events were also on offer.

It definitely is correlated. If someone who'd never watched city before told them they cared about them just as much me I'd direct them to the nearest mental home.

&gt; If we got relegated I would not be able to watch games at all since I am in the United States and The Championship does not get broadcast here. Even then there are only a few games a week that make it to TV in the UK as well. If you cant make it to a game in the lower division how do you follow the team? Radio? CHeck the scores in the paper the next day? Check the official website or some other site? The team Twitter? Facebook?

Yes? Any of those things? Until about 5 years ago, city were hardly ever on TV. I only started streaming about 7 years ago. That means I grew up through the first 20 years of my life listening to all away games on the radio with my family. I didn't think anything of it, it was just what you did, it was part and parcel of following the team. Now admittedly it's so much easier to keep up with the latest score that you could even say I gave up my season ticket at the right time; I can still watch every home game whether I'm there or not now. It's so little effort to follow the team now that even the half-hearted supporters can easily keep up to date. My uncle is an absolute die hard everton fan, who emigrated to Canada in 1980. He went from going to every game to having to read the match reports when my nan would send him newspapers once a month in the post. That's certainly a hell of a lot more effort than quickly checking bbc sport on your phone. If we were relegated and suddenly lost the majority of our entire American fanbase just because we were not on TV all the time, then that's almost good in a way; we'd have got rid of the casual fans who obviously can't be arsed putting in a grain of effort.

&gt; I didnt know we were having a pissing contest to see who had experience the lowest lows that the team has been through in it history. It seems that is something that gets brought up by the natives all the time when talking about how serious of a fan foreigners are.

alright, I think we'll just have to agree to disagree. I wasn't attempting to have a pissing contest: I was just stating that the support we have *is* different when there were 30,000 of us still spending the money we earn to go to games to watch a quality of football that is several orders of magnitude worse than we have now, than someone who admits to not watching a team because they lost a few games. There is no way I'm saying that all the new support we have is a bad thing, I'm just saying there's no way you can state we share the same connection to the club when it is entirely different thing to us. For many young mancunians it is a way of life; when I was a kid you'd have your 'church' every fortnight and then you'd go and make friends at the junior blues meetings whenever they were held. I like Amierican football. I try and catch the redskins whenever they're on channel 5 but I would never ever say that my connection to that club is the same as those who've been going to see that team week in week out for the past x number of years. It's just not the same at all.

&gt; you seem to have a strong dislike for foreign fans

Not at all. Not in the slightest. I totally see that as part and parcel of the game nowadays, I acknowledge without them there's no way we would be were we are today. The things I do have a dislike for is a) being told that my support is the same as someone who started watching us the other year and who's stopped following a team because they lost some games; and, as I've stated in this thread, b) the fact that city are now reserving tickets for overseas fans who will inevitable jump ahead in the queue over people who have been going to games for years.

We made some changes for season 2 (which ran feb-mar) with the groups less dense with the top two progressing. Rescheduling was changed and totally redone to a style similar to jDL with match threads and requiring 48 hours notice to reschedule. Raidcall is gone and replaced with a forum style. Score submission was changed to a googledrive document so everything could run almost autonomously freeing up our time to admin it all properly.

Season 3, which we have planned for the new academic year, we have taken season 2's changes and are rebuilding the website fully and totally rebranding. If a set number of teams sign back up who were in the brackets last season we're potentially running that as a higher division. The open groups will have a max of about 5 teams in then with 2 progressing to brackets.

Again, please read: http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette as that is your opinion, given that the topic is I don't tip taxi drivers, you can't argue that my logic (however nonsensical you believe it to be) is not on topic.  I'd suggest being able to grasp reddiquette might be a test of if you should be 'judging' others logic.

My logic is that a sole trader, who has just taken £15 for 10 mins work, with costs that we know are low (Insurance, Fuel, Carriage Loan).  Now I only know one taxi driver, but I know he made more than £65k last year, I know this, because he was asking me for investment advice, he does however work thursday and friday nights, which I appreciate many do not.  So I fully accept that is not a diverse sample.

But I will however stand by my back of fag packet maths, that they will be earning more than enough, given the costs to them.

I will also reiterate that they will not be declaring all of the income, the temptation is simply too great for them not too bend the rules a little bit.

Surely the title of this post kind of gives that away?

I don't think we can and I don't think it's important. We can't legislate for people's hearts and minds.

Ideally when booking lessons book 2 hour slots as opposed to 1. Not only will you get a better rate you also get a lot more actual driving time. A 1 hour slot will be about 10 minutes prep/discussion (do today we will be doing x, drive to y to start), 40 minutes driving and 10 minutes debrief/discussion (driving back to starting position and discussing the lesson), with a 2 hour slot you still have the 20 minute without real driving, but you get 100 minutes of driving.      
      
As for the costs it varies a lot, but for most people expect atleast £400 in lessons and £100 in tests (weekend passes costs more and tbh I would expect to fail atleast one of the tests). Speaking of tests get your theory ASAP it lasts 2 years.       
         
Once you get driving the costs do add up quickly.       
Your first year insurance is going to be £1000+, you can lower this by having additional drivers (family which will be using the car), having a black box and by taking a pass plus (tbh it didn't lower mine enough to justify the cost, but depending on your area it might).           

Car wise I would recommend you aim for something halfway decent if only to reduce the running costs. While a cheap car looks good at first the cost of passing a MOT will probably end up £100+, the road tax will be £100+, the MPG will be less then a newer car and strangely enough the insurance will be higher.     
A £1000 car will probably end up costing you more in maintenance and tax then a £4000 car (i10 for example), add in insurance and MPG. Your looking at a pretty big difference per year, not to mention resale value.       
Even on a new car I would budget £250 for maintenance, tax and servicing/mot.       
MPG your probably looking at 40mpg on an cheap old car and around the 55mpg on a newer car (the £4000 i10) at 10k miles per year your looking at £1075 and £1475 (£1.30/litre) in petrol.       

TL:DR;     
Learning budget for at least £500      
£1000 car + £1000 insurance + £500 tax &amp; maintenance + £1475 fuel = £3975 first year, £2975 ex. car
£4000 car + £1000 insurance + £250 tax &amp; maintenance + £1075 fuel = £6325 first year, £2395 ex. car     
The £4000 car would also be cheaper to insurance, but I doubt you'll get less then £1000 insurance after just passing.      
Expect your insurance to drop by about 10% every year. If you can paying for insurance annually it drops about 10% off the cost.       
       
These are rough figures, but should give you an idea. Its not cheap, but its one of those things its worth having and can pay for itself very quickly.",0,1406040803,null,0,false,0,cj4gxy7,t3_2bdtpg,t1_cj4gxy7,t3_2bdtpg,null,1434840338,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That doesn't answer the question. Why then is the issue of male circumcision **only** raised when discussing FGM?

&gt;That's because you're treating it as a separate subject. It isn't.

The WHO treats them as separate issues. The reasons they are performed are different, the level of harm cause is different. 

&gt;I think you are mistaken about this. If anything, the level to which it is still condoned makes it an even bigger problem.

The reason it is still condoned around the world is that it has real medical benefits to people in many countries, including stopping the spread of STD's and UTI's, whereas FGM has no medical benefits. One is a safe medical procedure which is arguably unnecessary in this country. The other is a form of mutilation and sexual subjugation. There are completely different things. 

&gt;The problems that people have with male circumcision would still exist if FGM was banned
&gt;Wouldn't it be sexist to ban mutilation of one gender but not the other, when neither is justified?

My point is that you shouldn't need to associate MC with FGM to make it look bad. You should discuss the problems in their own right.

It's not. There are subreddits devoted to it, like /r/Intactivists

&gt;The WHO treats them as separate issues. 

Because it's a political issue.

&gt;The reasons they are performed are different

Neither of which are a real justification.

&gt;the level of harm cause is different.

I'd suggest it's more subtle.

&gt;The reason it is still condoned around the world is that it has real medical benefits to people in many countries

Links please. Ones that haven't already been shot down in the past five years.

&gt;including stopping the spread of STD's and UTI's

Debatable, since this info has been contested almost since its' release. In short, my ears get dirty, but I don't cut 'em off to avoid that.

&gt;One is a safe medical procedure which is arguably unnecessary in this country.

No medical procedure is 'safe', and certainly not where surgery is involved.

&gt;The other is a form of mutilation and sexual subjugation

They're both forms of mutilation.

&gt;There are completely different things.

We're talking about mutilating the sexual organs of children. Coming up with a supposedly more-justifiable excuse for one gender does not change that statement, and neither does the result.

&gt;My point is that you shouldn't need to associate MC with FGM to make it look bad.

Why not? *Neither* practice needs any help to make them look bad, but why pretend they're different? Especially when we have *years* of unsubstantiated excuses like 'it's medically beneficial for boys' (Ears/ dirty, unless you can show infections rising in first-world, non-circumcised countries). I'd suggest it's actually essential to tie the two together, in order to stop the practice of insisting 'well, boys are different'. They're not, they're children just like girls, and chopping bits off of them isn't an option any more.

When it goes well it looks brilliant, and when it doesn't go well it's a disaster.

Nastasic is/was just a very cool head, and I tend to think of his style as efficient.  He gets himself into good positions to make life simple for himself, wins the ball, passes it.  He makes defending seem like the simplest thing in the world, whereas if you've ever watched Lescott you know it's an extremely complicated endeavour fraught with potential pitfalls.

I used the word ""was"" because this was under Mancini.  Under Pellegrini he's not looked nearly as comfortable or cool-headed.  Most speculate that it's the higher defensive line and I tend to agree.  Kompany and Demichelis are both looking to get onto the front foot anyway, so a high-line suits their natural style, but that's not been Nasty's style up to now.

I totally agree with you that the lack of physical barrier isn't a good reason and I also agree that the industry needs to adapt rather than just trying to preserve their archaic business model but this doesn't mean that I look down on those who do pirate things. In fact here are a few points in support of piracy:

* If it wasn't for piracy we wouldn't have half of the web designers we have now, a lot of these people learned their skills on pirated copies of photoshop;
* Same as above applies for people who produce music;
* If it wasn't for music piracy I wouldn't be supporting half of the artists I currently do now that I can afford to attend their gigs and buy all their releases.

true,metalmorgan,welsh2,North Wales,"I did this once.  I used to live in a doss-hole of a top floor flat, as you open my door and look out - there was an identical building (victorian house converted into flats) and a top floor flat front door that faced mine (We were separated by 2 drive ways so about 10m between us)  Anyways.  Hot day, like today.  I notice theirs a staffy wondering about on our drive, I investigate and see that my neighbour and occupant of the adjacent flat is out cold on his metal stair case leading to his flat. I yell across 'Hey dude, your dog is escaping.'  No response.  I try again 'You okay mate'  Nothing.  So I run down my stairs, and up his.  When I get to him, I can't rouse him and one of his arms is purple.  I didn't know what the heck was going on (I was 18 by the way)  So I call an ambulance.  Just as it arrives, he starts to wake and the paramedics start tending to him.  When he wakes properly he gets angry.  He's drunk, not in dire need of medical assistance at all.  His arm was going purple because he was lying on it.  It turns out he had been drinking all day (About 7pm on a hot Sunday)  Coincendtally his GF had been taken to hospital that day (I don't know why) and because the paramedics could not give him any information on her he got abusive, and physical.  Started arguing with the paramedics good style.  Then the Police arrive - I have no idea who called them, didn't see the medics radio or anything.  Neighbour gets arrested.  I have to look after his dog. I'm bricking it thinking that when this dude gets out of the nick, I'm gonna get battered.  Early next morning, my neighbour knocks on the door - I'm thinking that this guy is gonna be seriously pissed off with me - was dead wrong - he was totally grateful - said he was glad somebody had his back.  Bought me a 6 pack of strongbow.  Classy. 

TL:DR - Called ambulance for unconscious neighbour thinking he is dying. Turns out he is drunk. He gets angry.  He gets arrested.  All my fault. ",0,1406042845,null,0,false,0,cj4i0cz,t3_2bc8k6,t1_cj4i0cz,t3_2bc8k6,null,1434840648,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

- Member of the Centenary Eleven

- Granted an OBE

- Basically played so well they retired the number (although people might say otherwise, nobody used 25 since 2003 iirc)

- Really big thighs (might be a barrier to erecting a statue, not enough resources)

Frank Lampard would probably be second, being the clubs top scorer and everything.

Finally I'd probably say Ron Harris, although he's not in the last 10 years or so. Most appearances ever with something like 800 in 19 years and he was a former captain. Played in that crazy 1970 FA Cup Final against Leeds, and was the youngest ever captain in an FA Cup final (1967).

* 2013-14: Alberto, Aspas, Mignolet, K. Toure, Ilori, Sakho, Cissokho(loan), Moses(loan); 8 players.
* 2012-13: Borini, Allen, Assaidi, Yesil, Sahin(loan); 5 players (+ Sturridge and Coutinho in the winter window)
* 2011-12: Henderson, Charlie Adam, Doni, Downing, Jose Enrique, Coates, Bellamy; 7 players (+ a handful to the reserves/academy squad)
* 2010-11: Jonjo, Milan Jovanovic, Danny Wilson, Joe Cole, C. Poulsen, Brad Jones, Meireles, Konchesky; 8 players (+ Andy Carroll and Luis Suarez in the winter window)
* 2009-10: Aquilani, Glen Johnson, Kyrgiakos; 3 players (+ Maxi Rodriguez in the winter)

So far in 2014-15 we've added Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Emre Can, Lazar Markovic with Loic Remy allegedly on the way and possibly even Lovren and maaaybe even Alberto Moreno. So, at most - thus far - that's about 7 players.

Honestly, you figure only Lallana and Lovren would probably start making regular starts right from the beginning. Lambert and Remy will likely be first-choice sub/rotation options in the attack. And with the depth we have, the likes of Can and Markovic can be eased into the squad.

I'm really not that concerned.

I assume the reason for this post is the fear that we'll 'pull a Spurs' but in stark contrast to Spurs we returning many key members of the starting XI, Luis Suarez was extremely important but we didn't rely on him in the same way that Spurs relied on Bale, we have more coaching stability, etc.

We were formed in 1905 and have in recent history always been in the top 2 leagues of English football. In 2010 we were placed in administration, so we lost 10 points and most of our players, manager etc. The end of that season was SERIOUSLY tense as we just stayed up in the Championship (2nd league) on the last day of the season. After that we were bought by 4 guys. The first manager they hired was a man named George Burley who ended up having some drinking problems and was sacked. He was replaced by Dougie Freedman, club hero ex-striker. His first full season saw us beat Manchester Utd at Old Trafford in the League Cup. We got to the semis and then got knocked out on penalties. The next season, 2012-13, was unbelievable. We lost the first 4 games and were favourites to go down, but Dougie masterminded a meteoric rise over the next 2 months up the division right to the top, but was then offered more money by Bolton Wanderers (they were in the same league as us) so he left, now he's a bit of a pantomime villain. He was replaced by Ian Holloway, who kept us at the top end of the table and we made the Play-Offs. The semi final was against our arch rivals: Brighton. They were favourites, especially after drawing 0-0 in the 1st leg at Selhurst Park (our home ground) and having our 30 goal top scorer Glenn Murray taken off on a stretcher. In the second leg we were the better team and our academy graduate, £15m star player, Wilf Zaha, whom the Brighton fans had frequently called overrated, scored 2 amazing goals to send us to the final. At Wembley we beat Watford 1-0 in extra time, sending us to the Premier League for the first time in 9 years. 
Last season we had a torrid time in the first 10 games, losing 9 of the first 10. Holloway was sacked and we started to improve, then 1 month later Tony Pulis was hired. He totally turned the club around, we started winning games and soon we were feared by even the biggest teams, even beating Chelsea. The highlight of the season was the second last game: we were safe from relegation and playing our last home game against Liverpool, title chasers. You may have heard about that game, we were 3-0 down with 12 mins to go then scored 3 goals to draw 3-3 and end Liverpool's title hopes.

Fan favourite players are: Glenn Murray (CF), Dwight Gayle (ST), Julian Speroni (been at palace 10 yrs, brilliant GK), Joel Ward (RB), Yannick Bolasie (RW) and Mile Jedinak (CDM, Captain).

Last season was the first time we have stayed up in the Premier League, we are hailed as having the 'best fans in the premier league' as we sing and chant throughout the entire match, the team has a huge amount of team spirit and togetherness despite maybe not having the same quality of players as some of the teams around us. 

I'd be delighted to answer any other questions, and I hope this recent history isn't too long. Most of all, I hope you do decide to follow us this season and beyond!",0,1406043256,null,0,false,0,cj4i8cq,t3_2bed3f,t1_cj4i8cq,t3_2bed3f,null,1434840765,10,false,crystalpalace,t5_2tqdj,10

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt;  This might be a basic part of copyright and morally right, but why is it not a monopoly? 

Legally copyright is not a monopoly (unlike, e.g. patents) because it allows for independent creation. Copyright generally prevents copying - it doesn't stop someone else having economic control of a particular work provided that they came up with it independently, without copying the original one.

Which is never going to happen, but the loop-hole is still there.

That said, monopolies aren't necessarily wrong. And there are arguments about inter-changeability (whether you can swap one book for another) and so on.

But yes, copyright has given a handful of companies a dominant position in various publishing markets (film and music are the main ones). And there have been accusations of illegal activity; iirc there is an investigation going on into 2 of the big 3 music publishers at the moment in the US, and there was a big CD price-fixing scheme in the late 90s that was partly shut down by US/EU government action.",0,1406043337,null,0,false,0,cj4i9ym,t3_2bdnb2,t1_cj4i9ym,t1_cj4d6tt,null,1434840786,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The console has long been a form of DRM in and of itself. Piracy does still exist on consoles of course, but less people are willing to risk it. 

What this illustrates is that, when it comes to PC gaming, there has to be a new approach, because the 'war' against piracy doesn't come in a one size fits all solution. The 'war' won't ever be won by victimizing your customer base. It won't be won by suing pirates, who are still *potential* customers, and it won't be done by making paying customers jump through the DRM obstacle course. 

For example - I bought the game Homefront. Homefront, as I learned upon attempting to install, is a Steam game. Here's what was done in this case - only half of the actual game is on the disk, and you must download the second through Steam. The second half is 7 GB in size! Now, OK, if you have a decent connection, but what if you didn't? It would be practically impossible to do so, and congratulations, Steam/publisher/developer, you shot yourselves in the foot.

What needs to happen is to buy players that best fit the system. Star players don't mean shit if they can't play in it and with others. Studge wasn't that good at Chelsea, a bit better at Bolton but is thriving at Liverpool. Sig was good at Swansea but meh at Spurs. Soldado averaged 27 a season in 3 seasons at Valencia but here? Coutinho didn't fit in at Inter, does in Pool. Torres was very good at Pool, not so at Chelsea. Carroll sucked at pool, good at Newcastle. Atletico didn't have a stronger squad or ""star players"" like Barca and Madrid but they won La Liga and came second in the CL.

Sounds like you've got it all worked out. My mistake with my finance agreement was not taking into account future expenses but if you've already done that it sounds like you're set. 

The only other thing (which it seems like you would probably have already done) is to make sure you are negotiating the absolute best price on the car. 

I think WhatCar provides a target price. It's also a pretty good idea to leave it until the end of a registration period and/or the end of a financial quarter (if sales are low they will do anything to get another unit out the door.)

It's also not a bad idea to get plenty of different quotes. If you can get a better price even 500 miles away from a dealer, your local dealer will likely match it.

Arsenal is a possession-based team. This alone is a big similarity between them and Barca. You refuse to acknowledge this.

Arsenal is a slow-build up, short passing side, which is similar to Barca. You refuse to acknowledge this.

As for the differences, a single pivot is a player who connects their defense to attack, not just a CDM. Lee Cattermole, for instance is not a single pivot. The term pivot implies that they are taking the ball from defense and transitioning it into attack. Arsenal doesn't split CBs and ask Flamini to drop between them and play the ball forward to attacking players. Flamini provides cover for the CBs and has very little responsibility in forward play. Arteta is a better equation to a single pivot, and even he plays a bit further forward.

Yes, Arsenal does play more direct than Barca. If only I had mentioned this somewhere...

I'm not really sure what you're arguing against, to be honest. Arsenal plays in a similar philosophy to Barca. Do they play exactly the same? No. Do they play the style as successfully? No. Are they as good as Barca? No. But the similarities are there, and nearly everyone seems to recognize this except for you.

The point is, that there are some medically valid reasons for one, and AFIAK none for the other.  I had no choice in having to have one, it was incredibly painful and filled with downsides.  Yet compared to the alternative it was a blessing.

This is quite the curiosity to me, I've first hand experience of this, yet I'm being told by people who haven't apparently had it done, how horrific and brutal it is.  Yet I'm some atheist, I'm not doing it because some bible tells me so, I was doing it because I was in horrific pain and all the medical advice basically said lop it off!

The fact is that sometimes shitty things have to happen to stop shittier things from happening.  Sometimes some people have to die so that many more can survive.  Sometimes our relationship with a major world power can force us to do certain things that might, in a perfect world, not seem 'right', so we don't get screwed over.

**Midnight is similarly a bad idea.**  The whole point is that these people (like the audience if they've never seen an episode before) have no reason to trust the Doctor.  We who have seen other episodes know he's doing his best to figure it out and save people.  A first time viewer would see it more as a *12 Angry Men* situation than what it is intended as.

**The best introductory episodes are the ones designed to be introductions,** namely *Rose* and *The Eleventh Hour.*  If they like or can look past some sophomoric humor, start with *Rose.*  If you think a flashier production might go over better, start with *The Eleventh Hour.*  Both series 1 and series 5 are designed to introduce new fans to the show.  New British fans for series 1, and some new British fans and *a lot* of new American fans for series 5, the first to be broadcast on BBCA, as far as I know.

Just remember that a first time viewer is watching a totally different show to a long time fan.  They don't love the Doctor yet, so you need something that will make them fall in love.

I don't think that, in isolation, there's good argument that we have a moral right to simply take a copy of media that, for whatever reason, we would rather not pay for. I don't think precisely why we don't want to pay for it (""I can't afford it"", ""I only want to test it"", ""It's not worth the asking price"" etc.) is particularly important. Mostly because I don't see how we'd have any more of that stuff without paying somebody to make it; perhaps society's got its head round the distribution enough that it can be free, but that's not all that's involved.

I think that the music, film and publishing industries' historic failure to adapt to the Internet is a fair reason *at the time* to go round pirating all the things. Now that, by and large, they're getting their head round it I don't think there's much cause to carry on (as a caveat, I don't really do films and telly, so that might be way off still) - pirating songs in the face of Spotify, Grooveshark and friends just seems to be pointing out to the industry that whatever they do we're going to take it for free anyway.

true,Tidher,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"Just to make sure I understand this, you're saying that the existence of student loans does not save the taxpayer money in the following scenario:

* Students have to pay for (at least a portion of) their tuition.
* The government makes money available to students in the form of student loans.

If the above is the case, there are only really two other situations:

* Students have to pay for (at least a portion of) their tuition.
* The government does *not* make money available to students in the form of student loans (i.e. student loans do not exist, students must fund themselves).

Or:

* Students do not have to pay for their tuition.
* Student loans are therefore irrelevant and therefore do not exist.

The first of the above has a huge impact (namely many current students would not be able to afford to go to university), which would - in my mind, at least - unquestionably be a bad idea.

The second option has the effect of increasing the cost to the government of a student going to university (i.e. they have to pay an upfront chunk of money, as they do now via the loan, but with no expectation of getting any of it back). As far as I can tell this undoubtedly increases the cost to the tax payer. Instead of a given student eventually paying off even some of the cost of them going to university directly, all taxpayers (them included) share the burden equally.

Arguably there's the effect of having less administrative overhead, thereby reducing costs, but I can't believe that it's even close to that required to send a student to university.",0,1406048451,null,0,false,0,cj4l5cc,t3_2ba1oo,t1_cj4l5cc,t1_cj3kerk,null,1434842279,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; I'm not trying to claim that ""the proportion of people who would buy the thing were they to have not pirated is negligibly small"". There will always be people who would rather not pay for things they can afford. Would most of these people steal things from shops rather than pay for them? A small number would, yes, but probably a lot fewer than the people pirating without 'needing' to.

Yeah, I think piracy is much more prevalent than theft, partly because of the intangible loss - the only real loss is that the distributor has not taken some money they otherwise would have, and so on the face of it nobody is any worse off but the pirate is better off. Viewed in isolation, pirating a work is victimless. 

&gt; Netflix are certainly finding their stuff pirated. Do you hear them complaining about it? Do Netflix campaign to have file sharing sites blocked by ISPs? I seriously doubt it. 

Netflix were one of the louder voices behind the insertion of DRM into the HTML5 spec. Netflix do not like piracy and, much as I think they view it as technically impossible to eradicate they're doing what they can to make it harder.

&gt; What netflix recognises is that people do value their products and are prepared to pay for them, and that if they price their products correctly and make receiving it easy enough, then people will pay them enough for it to be profitable. They make it just difficult enough to pirate that some people value the convenience of their service over the free one.

Not really - nobody pirates Netflix by themselves rebreaking Netflix's DRM; the DRM is cracked by someone who shoves it on TPB or somewhere and everyone gets it from there. Really, the compelling reason to use Netflix is that its search is easier than TPB and it's easier to start a playing stream in the player.

&gt; You can also bet that they factor piracy in. The extended reach that piracy gives them has a huge impact for their brand. House of Cards was seen by so many people as a result of piracy, which was a massive stream of advertising for their brand.

Yeah, of course they factor piracy in, but that doesn't make it any more right than public transport allowing for fare dodgers does. Piracy was probably a stream of advertising, but I'm not sure that makes it right.

&gt;&gt; computers and the Internet allow for progress at such a pace that we have no need for morals?
&gt;
&gt; No. Computers and the internet have changed the world so much that a lot of the morals people apply to the real world no longer fit. When products can be infinitely replicated, stealing is no longer the same thing. It creates the need for a totally different way of looking at digital products, and a different moral landscape. The transactional model of the physical economy does not apply, and I think the moral outrage surrounding piracy is due to an inability to adapt to this new reality.

I think you're falling into the trap of conflating distribution with creation. Distribution costs of digital media are now effectively free, but we still need to give a human some incentive to make the thing we wish to distribute so. One where all media is free immediately sounds like a great world, but I don't know why anyone would bother making things in it.

He's a decent backup for a club of our level, and hoping to have both Vorm and Fabianski at the same time is unreasonable considering one would have to sit on the bench more often than not. 

In terms of fullbacks, I agree we need to strengthen -  although Ben Davies leaving doesn't have as strong an impact on this as many people think. Davies is a talent going forward, but in defensive duties Taylor is arguably the better of the two. The question is, how much will we miss Davies in attack? With both Bony and Siggy, I can't see there being too strong a need for it, and while he was good going forward I can't actually remember much of his moves resulting in goals. 

We need fullbacks for depth. Taylor and Rangel are solid, but I don't think we've got anybody else currently who can step in. Tiendalli and Jazz aren't up to scratch in my opinion, while the lad we've just signed from Falkirk might be but I don't think he was signed for immediate first team involvement.

In my opinion, assuming Davies and Vorm go and Siggy arrives, I'd say all we need to do immediately is get a right and left back. From there we just need to replace players if they leave, such as Pablo (who Montero is already lined up to replace). Pozuelo can go without desperate need to replace him, and Cañas can be replaced by Ki.

Yes you can rush out and buy your starter place for 150k, but hold on a second.  Whilst you'll be paying roughly 800 now, what about when the interest rates start to rise?  The BoE are constantly telling us that these low rates are temporary, they WILL go up.  So what's the average rate?  8%. So, your mortgage has just been bumped to nearly 1200 per month.  Ask yourself if you can afford this much?  The BoE know full well that once they start to raise interest rates there will be people who'll face repossession.  Rents can't rise much more than they already are, so that buy to let will start looking like a bad purchase.

If I was starting out now I'd sit back, rent, and wait.  Sooner or later this bubble will burst.  It should have in 2008 but it didn't.  However, it will.  There is also the issue of 'brain drain' and 'white flight' 300,000 people leave the UK each year and they're mostly well educated, white people.  These are being replaced by mostly unskilled, poorly educated migrants.  This will alter the landscape of British jobs hugely.  We are turning into one huge service industry, Britain in ten years time won't be the Britain of today.  Everything is shaping up for things to balance out. 

I personally believe the BoE will raise interest rates in order that house prices reduce.  They'll put a cap on lending multipliers the banks can use, which will further cool the market and everyone who has bought a property in the last ten years will be in negative equity.  However, the current under 25s will be able to more easily buy a house.  The Brit economy relies on house sales, and just like a shop who keeps doubling the price of his baked beans,there comes a day when he can't sell a single tin.  So he reduces the price, and keeps going until they sell again.

TL:DR - don't panic, the prices will come down eventually.",0,1406049079,null,0,false,0,cj4licq,t3_2bdsde,t1_cj4licq,t3_2bdsde,null,1434842512,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

**Set-up and Learning**

* Driving Lessons, £20 * 18 (I also practiced with parent in car) = £360.
* First Car, Peugeot 206 = £1,500.
* 1st Year Provisional Insurance (with telematics tracking) = £1,400
* Theory Test = £35
* Practical Test, £70 * 2 = £140
* Upgrade insurance from provisional to full license = £240

**Insurance**

* 2nd year based on perfect driving with telematics box = £750
* 3rd year based on perfect driving with telematics box = £470

**Car Maintenance**

* Car MOT, £40 * 3 + £600 or so in repairs over 2 years = £720
* Tyres, 1 set of 4 so far = £140
* Oil &amp; servicing, £90 * 2 = £180
* Breakdown repairs = £180
* Car Tax, £140 per year = £280
* Wipers, screenwash, etc. = £60
* AA Breakdown Cover = £150

**Fuel**

Apparently my car is 40mpg according to online, so fuel at £1.30/l is just shy of £6 a gallon. I have driven around 5,000 miles a year which puts my fuel cost per year at £750 (5000 / 40 * 6). 

**Freedom**

Priceless.


----------------------------------------


Overall cost for my first 2 years works at around **£8,250**. Insurance has come down in price thanks to all the price comparison sites so that can be cheaper. It can vary hugely but that's my experience with a reasonably well maintained small car.

true,grodecki,,Accountant,"That is fair enough, I believe a lot of that can be avoided with proper research and care, but you can be unlucky. Repairs costing more than value does not necessarily mean the car is a terrible thing; it is a known quantity and when repaired, it is repaired and does not need constant monthly payment. 

There's a couple of things I really reccomend you look into first before jumping into this.

1. Milage limit. A quick look at a random Clio PCP deal shows a 5k a year milage limit. That's under 100 miles a week. If you used it purely to commute to work your commute better be under 10miles or that alone is going to go over your limit. You can get PCPs with higher agreements but they usually cost significantly more, as it is a critical part in the resale value further down the line as the world is over obsessed with the miles a car has done, rather than the way it has been treated. Alternatively you pay a fixed rate per mile over the limit, which is not a cheap way of motoring, at all.

2. The effective APR of the pcp deal. Again, this quick look at clio pcp deals shows it is between 6-8%. If you have half decent credit a bank loan will be cheaper, and give you more ground in negotiation as you will effectively be a cash buyer to the dealership. This varies per dealership, however, as some get good kickbacks for fiannce deals. Look into it.

3. Final value. GFVs that are given on PCPs are usually low, as they need to definitely get a profit. I can't comment on clios as I have very little interest in them but look into it, do some research and see whether it is likely that the car would be worth a lot more than the value says.

The other thing you need to be aware of is that even though you are not directly seeing the value drop; you are paying the depreciation as it drives off the forecourt. There is no way around that. You're also paying interest on the 'loan' and have restrictions on how you can utilise the car, as you do not own it. (milage is the primary one here).

You need to fully run the sums to ensure you are getting a good deal, or, that the convienience factor outweighs that of the extra price.

If I were in your situation and did not want to buy an older used car would be to look at something a year or two old, buy with cash (via a loan if really needed) that still has the manufactures warrenty, and save the huge depreciation cost you will be paying, regardless of how you get the car.

I'm honestly not trying to put you off, I'm just saying to actually run the sums and decide what is worthwhile for you.

true,pinumbernumber,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt;It's always been easier on PC/home computer to pirate. Now, on consoles, DRM has worked better, because it's a machine that's controlled.

Yep, but people don't expect much control on a fixed-purpose embedded device. If I buy a dedicated blu-ray player I expect it to strictly and effectively implement DRM and while I might not be happy about it, I'm not going to complain.

A ""computer"" (quoted because the term is getting increasingly vague nowadays. Let's assume a regular tower desktop or laptop here) is a generic device which I bought to run what I want on. It is 100% under my control. I can and will do what I want with any data that passes through it. It is silly for publishers to pretend that they can secure it when they haven't been able to despite trying for decades.

The solution is to abandon the absurd idea of DRM and provide content in whatever format is most convenient and flexible. It will not increase piracy because everything is already available to pirates.

This has pissed me off in the past too, but in fairness, it's probably got less to do with DRM and more to do with publishers cheaping out on number of disks and/or being overly liberal with issuing  huge mandatory patches.",0,1406050939,null,0,false,0,cj4mlkg,t3_2bdnb2,t1_cj4mlkg,t1_cj4izt4,null,1434843080,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Someone ripped will have more strength than someone lean, unlike someone with definition. Lamela has very obviously gone from lean to ripped - he's clearly put on a lot of muscle weight. His biceps are twice as large as last season and his and went from being defined to bursting even though his core has doubled.

He was a very skinny boy this time last year when we bought him, now his hard work in the gym has obviously paid off. He still won't be able to hold off the Adams and Tiotes of the world as they're more stoutly built than he is but all he needs to do is an extend an arm to hold them off before he spins around them. The biggest benefit he'll see from this muscle gain is how quickly he'll be able to explode and turn while holding off defenders, he still won't he able to hold into the ball with brute strength.

I think the board, or whoever, does not want to displace Johnson as #1 because of the wages he is on.

A replacement for Johnson would probably cost a lot of money, plus high wages, and having a player on 100k+ a week as second string is not acceptable. I think that we will buy Manquillo and have Flano, Manquillo, + a good RB after Johnson.

In my opinion this is a smart move. Lets not kid ourselves, there are not many available replacements for Johnson that would be a huge step upwards that would not cost us a hefty transfer fee + wages. I believe the club is making the right decision here.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; Arguably there's the effect of having less administrative overhead, thereby reducing costs, but I can't believe that it's even close to that required to send a student to university.

How many people do you think the SLC employs? Their web page has 9 different department managers listed. I think 100 would be a conservative estimate. If we assume they all earn the median £20k/yr (again conservative, it wouldn't surprise me if the average wage was closer to £35k) then they are spending £2m/yr on staff wages along.

On top of that there'll be various forms of additional taxes, national insurance, benefits package (especially pensions), etc. It is reasonable to say that a person actually costs twice as much as their wages. So we have £4m/yr purely on staff.

That is enough to put 450 students through university on its own and it is pure waste. We aren't gaining any overall cost benefit to the nation at large for it.

This is without all the other costs of business. Rent, electricity, IT purchases, etc.

Then there is the very nature of the loans. They are quite explicitly set up to normally grow slower than the future value of the initial sum. I.E. the debt actually depreciates for merely existing.

The third component in this is how much of the original debt gets written off. This is where the Tories screwed up their numbers. Their assumptions were based upon the idea that most courses would go for £6k/yr fees. They expected universities to cut their budgets and offer a lower class offering for students unwilling to take on the £9k/yr fees. In practice nearly every university immediately picked £9k/yr. This pushed the write off percentage from 50% up to something like 80% IIRC. So essentially very little of the final sum is being paid back.

So right now the gains from getting that 20% need to be larger than the costs of administration and value depreciation. It turns out that the figures came about to almost exactly break even.",0,1406052038,null,0,false,0,cj4n8x6,t3_2ba1oo,t1_cj4n8x6,t1_cj4l5cc,null,1434843352,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Make sure children in these communities are in our school system. Make sure pregnant women from these communities are told of the dangers to their daughters' health that arise from something they may see as being merely a benign adherence to their culture.

Screaming 'JAIL THEM, DEPORT THEM' only increases the 'Us vs Them' mentality and prevents any form of discussion taking place. It would pay more dividends to educate younger members of these communities.

For example, what do you think would be more effective in changing the viewpoint of an adolescent boy who has been raised in an über-male-chauvinist culture? Telling him he's wrong and that if he doesn't change that he'll be thrown in prison? Or telling him that women who have their clitorises and labias intact not only have a more aesthetically pleasing body, but are far more likely to enjoy sexual intercourse?

I hit the same problem with the subtitles when I ripped *Killing Zoe* and have since come to the conclusion this is an inherent problem with transcode-ripping DVDs.

I now recommend that the only good way to rip a DVD is to simply create a full-sized .iso file image of the disk.

It kinda seems silly to keep a 5gb .iso image of a DVD, all in that wasteful inefficient mpeg2, when you can get the same image quality with a 1gb mp4 file, but I believe it's impossible to account for all the things you can possibly miss if you rip to mp4 or even mkv.

Even if you manage to include all the titles, chapters, audio tracks and subtitles that you need, the DVD standard says that it's ok for the aspect ratio of the image to change at any time on the fly, and if a movie does this without you being aware of it then parts of the transcode will end up stretched.

There was a crack in a garden wall. After a structural engineer showed no connection to the house, they felt the stairs on it were a health and safety hazard. The stairs were lacking the final layer of bricks on top to finish it off, and because of this were quite ""deep"" steps. They wanted us to get planning permission to rebuild the wall, quotes on a cost to rebuild the wall/stairs, and a structural engineer to plan it all. This added up to about £9000 the bank would not give to us (retain) in the mortgage until the work was done. That's £9000 we have to magically find on top of £3000 advocate fees and the deposit.

Had to walk away from that house, because the stairs weren't finished to the banks standard. Thankfully all we spent was £400 on a structural engineer.

The banks are making it very hard for those with only enough money to cover a deposit and advocate fees to purchase a house that may or may not need work. If it needs work, or they think it will, say hello to expensive reports that they want done before they tell you how much money they won't give you. Now every house we see is a worry of wasting £500 on a valuation. And if it is a waste, we're down a months saving.

So to safely purchase a £200,000 house we need at least £30,000 to cover excess fees/reports/retention as long as no serious problems are found. Unless the house is pristine, then it should be fine, but hello extortionate houses prices.

That isn't the barometer on which we need to evaluate our young players, but when you look at the players we had coming through from Houllier forward they were always shit and somehow we still got excited about them. This crop of kids is completely different.

Flanno looked like he might be nothing more than a championship also ran before last season and look how he came on. I agree with those who say he'll never be world class but people really do seem to forget that not every player has to have world class moves to be absolutely invaluable to a side. 

I think everyone writing off Kelly are going to feel supremely stupid some day. Wisdom, I feel, is in a tough place because he's not a perfect RB or CB. 

But bringing in a loan signing to block chances for other hungry young players seems BEYOND awful. 


People seem to forget that Rodgers had very little to do with half our young players coming through. He was forced to play kids and in having his hand forced he found talent. He has, at many junctures, attempted to sign players who were in no way clearly better than what we already had. 

If we signed Willian last summer I don't think we'd have challenged for the title and Raheem Sterling would have not played for England and maybe would have stunted his development. Flanagan only got a run because Cissokho and Enrique were injured. Raheem has had more end game in his game at 17-19 than Willian has in his whole career.

I think that part of the issue is the fact that they want to have more female panelists on, but there are fewer female comedians. If you are picking the best out of a group that is already very small, you aren't going to get ~~the same quality~~ as many people who fit in well with the show as if you pick from a much larger pool.

Here is Jo Brand talking about it:

""Jo Brand has previously highlighted a “practical problem” of supply and demand.

She said: “There are far more male comics than women. When I started, there were about 200 male stand-ups and about 20 female – roughly one woman for every two-and-a-half panel shows.”

http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-bans-all-male-panels-comedy-3128817

I think this could be better remedied by not just bringing on female comics, but also more female scientists, historians, and experts. They have had success IMO with Prof. Brian Cox and Rev. Richard Coles, and I'm sure they could find interesting female experts who would enjoy the opportunity to be on the show.

&gt;This might seem a fairly insignificant amount to potentially lose from the UK’s total GVA, which was some £1,383bn in 2012, according to ONS figures.
&gt;
&gt;But Scotland’s departure from the UK would have a detrimental effect on overall national GDP, with a recalculated figure based on the reduced UK population showing a drop of £282.50 per head.

&gt;The UK's total GVA, which was some £1,383bn in 2012, according to ONS figures.
&gt;
&gt;The effect of Scotland - and its population - leaving the UK would be a small increase in GDP per head of some £117.

&gt;UK without Scotland|£21,404
&gt;
&gt;Calculation based on GDP figures with 'not allocated' GVA removed. Source: ONS

Unfortunately it is rather difficult to work out just how this change has been calculated given [the relationship of GVA to GDP](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/national-accounts/gva/relationship-gva-and-gdp/gross-value-added-and-gross-domestic-product.html) and without the population figures used.

&gt;GVA + taxes on products - subsidies on products = GDP

Edit

I'm also pretty sure the GVA numbers don't include North Sea oil and gas production.

Edit 2:

I'm certain the GVA figures don't include North Sea oil and gas production. [This](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-accounts/regional-gross-value-added--income-approach-/december-2013/stb-regional-gva-2012.html) - Regional GVA NUTS2, 1997-2012 (from [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/taxonomy/index.html?nscl=Regional+GVA)) gives the figure of £106.3bn for Scotland that the BBC article uses (table 2.1 on spreadsheet). The breakdown of the various sectors that contribute to that is on table 2.5 of the spreadsheet. Nowhere is North Sea oil and gas mentioned. I would argue that the drop in the UK's GDP would be much higher had the figures for the North Sea been taken into account and to omit them renders this article particularly misleading.

We had identified him as a serious target, we'd identified a specific role for him at City. Then we appointed the manager he had at Malaga whom he described as his ""football father"", and he'd spoken to Pellegrini about the move and apparently given assurances to Manuel that he'd move after the U21 tournament in Israel. We were the only club seriously in for him at that stage.

At that U21 tournament he was player of the tournament (IMO), and was suddenly being noticed as a serious prospect in Spanish football. He was noticed as a commodity which was going to leave the Spanish league for England.

Then Real Madrid sat up and took notice all of a sudden. Zidane tapped Isco up to try and assure him he'd get playing time at Real, and after the tournament Isco went back on his word to us and signed with Real.

Fast forward a year, and after starting life very brightly at Real, Isco spent most of the rest of the season as a bit part player, and missed out on a place in the Spain squad for the World Cup.

And now, as Real do, they've signed the latest shiny must have players (Rodriguez, Kroos) and he's even further out in the lurch.

That's what Real do. They make gratuitous pointless luxury signings based on who's the latest 'must have'.

Isco should've realised that we were the wiser move for his career.

Now his future's up in the air again, but now our squad is full of talent and we'd have to sell to buy.

Stupid, stupid boy.

true,Tidher,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"&gt; That is enough to put 450 students through university on its own and it is pure waste.

In 2013 there were [""almost 496,000 students beginning full-time undergraduate courses""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-25432377), and there are approximately 2.3 million students in higher education at this time [(source)](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/stats). Assuming the figure you stated is doubled to cover ""all the other costs of business"" (mostly pulling this figure out of thin air, but it doesn't sound horrific), it's a drop in an ocean.

&gt; This pushed the write off percentage from 50% up to something like 80% IIRC.

[This article](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/mar/21/student-fees-policy-costing-more) disagrees with the figures you've stated, but I certainly agree that it's not *saving* them money. If we want to save money, why not stop spending money on education entirely? I appreciate that this is an extreme end of a somewhat poor argument, but there are far more factors to consider than the amount of money saved/spent.

In particular, the loans are such that they have less initial impact on a graduate (i.e. the higher payback threshold means that their relatively low initial salary won't be affected as much), and though it'll cost them more in the long run the impact will be less severe. I've spoken to a good few students in the following years, and the majority opinion is that, while it's certainly a concern, the fact that they'll be more financially secure once initially out of university - a tough time for many - they actually find very reassuring. I would gladly have the new system retroactively applied to my loan, as it would make the amount I'm paying now (which isn't significant, but it's still money) a significant fraction lower, and I'm likely to be one of those who pays off their loan in the long run (practically a certainty with the old rates, and would have been very likely with the new ones).

Anything that makes life for recent graduates easier, creates 100 (using your figure) jobs, and has no additional cost, I am all for.",0,1406055350,null,0,false,0,cj4p7wo,t3_2ba1oo,t1_cj4p7wo,t1_cj4n8x6,null,1434844462,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,jgms,newcr-1,"Kompany, Hummels, Silva, Stones.","Ended up being able to watch the match. Ill give some updates along the way. 

**22**' - Game has been fairly even so far, we're pressing well and have won possession quite a few times leading to breaks but they haven't materialized to anything yet. We're not giving up any chances but Duffy and Distin at the back haven't looked too great just yet. Best player so far has been Conor McAleny, he's looked bright winning the ball back and picking out passes. He had a terrific run into the box that Naismith easily could have put in but he lost it in his feet from 6 yards out. 

**29**' - GOAL EVERTON - Just as I'm typing that Naismith has been our worst player so far, he puts one in the back of the net. Beauty of a cross from Garbutt on the left and Naismith was perfectly positioned in the box to tap it in. He's had several chances already and his touch has been awful but that goal was a proper strikers goal. 

**33**' - Great tackle from Garbutt covering at the back, perfectly timed. He has looked great so far, Garbutt, he looks like a young Baines, loves to get forward and whip in crosses and he is linking up with Pienaar quite well. John Lundstram in the middle of the pitch with Barry has been great, terrific control and passing. Just played a peach of a ball across the pitch to Garbutt that had the commentators excited. 

**42**' - Pienaar with a chance in the box but he shoots right at the keeper. I think I heard Matthew Kennedy's name mentioned for the first time this half just now, hes been anonymous so far. We're dominating possession now as the half is closing out, the midfield has been very strong so far. 

**44**' - Free kick on the edge of the box but Garbutt puts it into the wall and then again on the followup. Kennedy jinks into the box and plays a great ball in but it is cleared back to Lundstram outside the box who absolutely smashes it just wide of the far post. Cracking effort. 

**HALF TIME**

I'm expecting a changed lineup for the second half so Ill break down the performances from the players we've seen this first half. 

Robles: Hasn't had much to do, but doesn't seem all that confident in goal still. 

Browing: Caught out one or two times but he is a strong and quick lad and was easily able to get back and cover. Looks like a decent player but not outstanding, he didn't get forward too much. 

Distin: Was a little slow to react a couple of times but he still looks 22 out there and was playing better as the half progressed. 

Duffy: He's been ok but just doesn't look like he has the ability to pass the ball effectively as much as he's asked to do in Roberto's system. 

Garbutt: Outstanding so far, easily one of the best players on the pitch, has been looking strong coming forward on the left. His crossing is amazing, he whips in crosses with pace and accuracy and easily could have had another assist or two this half. His link up play and defensive awareness is fantastic as well. Made one bad tackle that should have been a yellow, but no harm done. 

Barry: It's been a typical Barry performance, he's looked strong and was spreading the ball around nicely. 

Lundstram: He's been quite good so far, made one error in the defensive zone but has been getting forward well and passing the ball nicely. 

McAleny: Tidy footwork, fast, links up nicely. Think we'll see more of him this year. 

Kennedy: Not done much, he has one little bit of skill in the penalty area that I mentioned. 

Naismith: Other than the goal his touch has been poor and link up play the same but he improved as the half progressed. 

Pienaar: Looking great, tight passing and link up with Garbutt. He looks quite fit which is good, he's been running a ton.   

**Second Half** - completely new lineup. 

**50**' - Good start to the half. McGeady moves down the right and puts in a beautiful cross that Osman nearly heads in at the back post, but he can't get up high enough. 

**60**' - Chris Long shoots from distance and puts it over. Gibson has been spreading the ball right to left brilliantly, its great to see him playing again. McCarthy looks very bright, Stones as well, they're passing the ball around quite well, retaining possession. No real cutting edge yet

**63**' - GOAL TRANMERE ROVERS - Poor John Stones takes down a goal kick on his chest and his touch back to Robles is poor. He puts through the Tranmere player 1 on 1 with Robles and he chips him deftly. Not fun to watch that...

**69**' - Alcaraz gives the ball straight to a Tranmere player and then makes a bad tackle as he is nearly passed on a break. Gibson then gives the ball away and Robles is forced to make a smart diving save. He nearly pushes it to an enemy player but Hibbert is there to get in his way. 

**71**' - GOAL EVERTON - Guess who? Its LEON OSMAN with a side foot finish at the back post off of a McGeady corner. Bad news though, Coleman has injured his hamstring in winning the corner and his substituted for Luke Garbutt. Looks precautionary but Coleman goes straight to the dressing room. 

**75**' - Great bit of play leads to an Osman chance, forcing a great save from the Tranmere keeper. Hibbert, McGeady and Gibson linked up incisively down the right to tee up Ossie on the edge of the box.  

**81**' - Osman has a cheeky effort from outside the box, trying to chip the keeper but it goes just wide. 

**84**' - Gibbo with a free kick from a nice spot outside the box and its heading for the top corner but the Tranmere keeper gets a hand on it. 

**87**' - GOAL TRANMERE ROVERS - Alcarez steps into midfield and makes a tackle, but the ball goes right back to Tranmere and Alcarez can't recover in time as the ball is played wide and then sent into the box. Stones can't get across as the ball is played off of the post and then put in on the rebound. 

**FULL TIME 2-2**

Well that was a disappointing end to the match, we should have won that one. Two defensive lapses cost us cheap goals. The good news is that these things can be ironed out before the season starts. We were lively going forward and the defense was good for the most part, bar those two errors. All of our midfielder tonight looked good. In the second half Osman and McGeady really stood out, Gibson and McCarthy were terrific as well, they didnt give anything away and it was nice to see them get forward quite often. Gibson bombed forward a few times and he looked really dangerous with the space that he opened up. The youngsters Hope and Long weren't too impressive although Long did have a nice dribble that put him inside the box on one occasion. 

Colemans injury didn't look too serious. He sprinted down the right to win a corner and then felt his hamstring, had a couple words with the staff and then went off. I dont think that they wanted to risk him by keeping him on, it seemed like it was just a precaution. We'll see. 

I hope I was able to help anyone who wasn't able to watch the match. If anyone has any other questions or feels like I am missing something just let me know and I'm happy to go into some more detail.

Humans are far better than computers at that sort of audio analysis. Even the best signal processing software struggles to interpret natural speech or musical notes correctly when they're presented to it in a clean and relatively ideal format. A computer cannot identify the whizz of a rocket against a background of noise. It just doesn't have the intelligence to estimate, consider, or imagine like humans do. Software will be used in some in depth analysis, but will be heavily guided by humans at all times. 

Other than that, no, noise reduction would kill a lot of valid audio data and shouldn't be used (it's not like they can clean the audio up and just leave the sound of people screaming in the background), and headphones are okay for a lot of audio tasks, but can't beat the sort of sonic replication this lab seems to aim towards.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; So it's half as complex as active, but with more restricted range. XGPON is then shared out to how many nodes? Last I checked it was 128 per node but that's variable depending on how BT feel about it. 

128 sounds right, but I'd bet no sane operator would go near that. BT might, but remember that the FTTC cabs / fibre distribution points have way more fibre than they need, so they could easily spread the load over a few more fibres. In the FTTP roads near me it looks like you'll struggle to have one person on a splitter, let alone 128 (there aren't many cables poking out of the tops of the manifolds on the poles, assuming one cable = one drop to a house)

&gt; hat 2.5gbit/s upload then goes down to 20mbit if everyone is using it (vanishingly rare, but possible). To me it seems silly to be spending all this money and getting something which is marginally better than FTTC under bad conditions. ""Don't half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing"" springs to mind.

That's assuming a maximum split, maximum demand and no advances in technology to improve that. I'd say that it's a little bit scaremongery. It's not wireless, there is plenty more still to happen.

&gt; There is also the very strong argument that BT want to continue restricting upload to retain the extremely lucrative leased line market. You don't just want people to have cheap access to really fast internet when you can artificially restrict support and make money off it.

Or just because PON fits in with the asymmetric model of the Internet. I'd say that BT's attempts to make FTTP on demand rather still born are a conspiracy to protect leased line revenue. Massive construction costs and a really long minimum term (3 years I think) will put many people off. 

I know a lot of people, myself included that would jump at it if it were sub-£1000 install but it'll never happen. I think the universal service obligation still only obligates BT to provide one phone line capable of 28.8k. Scandalous.

&gt; Depends how fast you want to go. There are plenty of devices that can handle 1Gbit/s of throughput which work passively. Cost might be an issue but basically the saving comes from not having more devices where the splitters are.

Passively? As in PON? I don't get what ""Cost might be an issue but basically the saving comes from not having more devices where the splitters are."" Are you explaining how PON is cheaper?

&gt; Ideally yes. However you've basically traded off all the benefits of fibre to get something which acts like copper. Most of these problems are a direct result of the VOA's pants-on-head-retarded fibre tax.

I don't think UK government policy influences choices made by Verizon and other telcos though. I just don't think the choice of PON is a bad idea, the stupidity is in spending loads of money on VDSL which is already rather dead end unless vectoring delivers what was promised, and unless BT decides to start line bonding. But still, FTTP could eliminate all this hassle.",0,1406056195,null,0,false,0,cj4pppm,t3_2bdgta,t1_cj4pppm,t1_cj4gdpn,null,1434844809,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You won't hear much opposition to getting rid of the word Empire, but there'd probably be plenty of debate about how you go about it and governments decide there are more important things to do.

I've also seen it suggested that the Queen's view is ""If it really must be changed, can you please wait until I am no longer Monarch?""

You're trying to throw out as many different arguments as you can and then acting as if they are all as important as each other.

I was only responding to the cleanliness aspect, which is supposedly one of the reason to make physical modifications to baby body parts, according to you. Unfortunately this is not even remotely a good argument because as you can see, you can make modifications to other body parts to keep them cleaner too, but it doesn't mean anyone could, or would support it.

So as you've decided to put in your own experience as an argument, how about I explain how utterly unthoughtful that one is, too:

You had an issue with a body part and got medical attention, as you should have, which solved the issue. That was the correct thing to do.

But now you are promoting the idea that it can be seen as a good idea to prevent such things in advance.

So how about removing babies feet to prevent trenchfoot?

Or we could remove one lung at birth to halve the chance of lung cancer!

Removing body parts to pre-empt something that *might* go wrong with them is a step short of insane. I can't honestly believe you think your personal anecdote justifies anything at all.

That might fix your issue altogether, as they may be outside the time limit and then you can tell them to shove it. 

If not, I would get in contact and very kindly ask if they have contacted the wrong person, as the chair in *your* room was in good condition when you left and that, if they are sure they've contacted the correct person, could they please provide dated proof of the damage?

People walk on past or stand and not do anything because they assume there is someone else who can deal with the problem around and don't want to suffer any perceived humiliation from others.

Just think about it, you see a bloke unconscious the street. Is he asleep? He's probably asleep. Maybe he drank too much. Maybe he's on drugs. He's probably on drugs.

true,Brian_M,null,null,"&gt; This has pissed me off in the past too, but in fairness, it's probably got less to do with DRM and more to do with publishers cheaping out on number of disks and/or being overly liberal with issuing huge mandatory patches.

To be honest, if publishers are willing to cheap out on a *disk*, which costs very little to manufacture, there's not much hope for them. If that's the kind of penny-pinching they're into, then hopes of a turn around in their attitude to wide spread DRM reform seem a long way off. Patches? OK, although I don't see why there can't be an option to just run version 1.0, or whatever version comes on the physical media, so long as it can actually run. Fair enough, if you want to play the game online, where maybe everybody being up to date is more conducive to a smooth gameplay experience for all, but I still don't see the point of mandatory patches when all you want to do is play single player.
