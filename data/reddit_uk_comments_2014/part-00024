true,EpicFishFingers,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,"I think there's every right to be suspicious, You're asking for access to a device designed solely to harm and kill. They're just so easily abused. I can't think of anything so easily abused as a gun, other than a car, but even then you need a driver's license, your personal info is tied to the vehicle etc.

The only other thing I can think of is the knife, but most knives are not made to stab people, rather to cut veg or to be used as a tool (and yes, there is plenty of knife crime in the UK, but that still just epeaks against implementing gund for  those knife criminals to abuse instead). A gun cannot be used as a tool unless you extend this use to shooting vermin to protect your farmland, and even then traps and loud gunshot-like noises scare off vermin just fine.

If people want to target practice, then fair enough. Why not just introduce guns at shooting ranges that you can rent, that are obviously secured to the target range by cables etc. (like the digital cameras are in Currys), with heavy CCTV at the sites. Then people can shoot their guns legally, and there is no fear of using the gun for its intended purpose: killing.

I'm quite happy with the law as it stands at the moment. Just because someone hasn't ever committed a crime doesn't go to say that they never will, so i think it's a good idea to questions peoples' motives in relation to gun ownership.

&gt;**The Museum of Curiosity**, formerly titled **The Professor of Curiosity**, is a comedy panel game on BBC Radio 4 that was first broadcast on 20 February 2008. It is hosted by John Lloyd (Professor of Ignorance at the University of Buckingham, and later at Southampton Solent University). He acts as the head of the (fictional) titular museum, while a panel of three guests – typically a comedian, an author and an academic – each donate to the museum an ‘object’ that fascinates them. The radio medium ensures that the suggested exhibits can be absolutely anything, limited only by the guests’ imaginations.

I mean, who's to say that the Doctor, traveling with Rose to see the beaches of Vigus didn't accidentally get waylaid in the United States in 1960, discover a Cyberman plot in New York involving a low resonance transponder found near Rockwell's home in New York, and defeat the Cyberman before an astonished Rockwell. And then reveal to the artist -- who had lost his beloved wife the year before -- that, he, too had produced some art in the style of his second favorite artist (Van Gogh ranking first), namely Rockwell. 


Who couldn't imagine the Doctor telling Rockwell that despite the loss of love and friends, one must sally forth, providing Rockwell with the Doctor's own work depicting the various faces he's had and explaining the companions from his past?  And who is to say Rockwell didnt't ask if he could keep it and maybe paint a similar work in honor of the Doctor and to remember what the Doctor told him about the importance of remembering who we are, regardless of our face at the time, about love and loss and introspection?

&gt;On that occasion, he said :’ ‘I have a feeling that prohibition in this whole area simply isn't working. Every year we say that we are going to fight the war on drugs harder than we have fought it the year before. And I think this is one of those areas of life, and, whilst people may find this distasteful, I think we need a proper full Royal Commission on this whole area of drugs to investigate whether perhaps life might be better for millions of people living on council estates that are dominated by the drugs dealers, that are dominated by the crime that surrounds, the money that people raise, to get these drugs, let's find out through a Royal Commission whether perhaps we should decriminalise drugs, whether we should license them, license the users, and sell them at Boots - because frankly if you add up the costs of drugs to society the big problem is the fact that they're criminal and everything that goes with that. And I think there is an argument that says if we decriminalised it we would make the lives of millions of people far better than they are today.’

So yes, banning things is stupid when criminals by definition don't follow the law.

Banning drugs hasn't stopped people taking drugs. And banning handguns hasn't particularly lowered crime involving handguns. It's no surprise that somebody willing to shoot you isn't too fussed about a gun law. So I don't see why we shouldn't look at modernising those laws.

However, there are something like 2 million registered shotgun owners in the UK. Sawing one down is trivial. And making your own slugs is trivial. Yet there is almost no crime using sawn off shotguns with deadlier ammunition. I really think a handgun ban wouldn't change much, apart from giving people a better ability to defend themselves against criminals and opening up a cool and fun hobby for more people.

He also had another two other legal handguns in his home he did not bring. I would love the source that says he used illegal guns.

He was known to the police as people had made complaints of his behavior towards young boys in his care not for anything to do with his ownership of guns, he was investigated by the police for his conduct 4 separate times and each time there was not enough evidence to charge him.

&gt;Four Scottish police forces investigated Hamilton after parents made at least 12 complaints or accusations. Each time detectives failed to find a case that would stand up in court. Central Regional Council tried to stop him holding his boys' club meeting in Dunblane High School in the early 1980s. He forced it to back down.
Hamilton was not merely lucky, he was clever enough to organize support. The local government ombudsman for Scotland, gun-club managers, gun-shop owners, the police officers who approved gun certificates, councillors and parents all came to his aid

&gt;This has nothing to do with a lack of guns though. Strict gun legislation has decreased the amount of crimes involving firearms.

Prove it. I'm going to say it's better policing. Homicides did not decrease after the handgun ban, the ban was utterly useless. Violent crime (at least according to the police) has been declining since 1995. The ban was implemented in 1997.

&gt; Scotland historically has a higher rate of violent crime, making guns **more widely available** isn't going to reduce this, on the contrary its more likely to increase it.

I'm done. Nobody here fucking understands. Allowing handgun ownership under a firearms certificate DOES NOT EQUATE TO BEING ""WIDELY AVAILABLE.""

The reason this meme has gained so much traction over the last 18 months is also really obvious: More than half of his deus ex machina scripts have come in the last season. (And this is further exacerbated by the fact that the majority of the scripts he *didn't* write in S7 were *also* deus ex machina: ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"", ""The Power of Three"", ""Rings of Akhaten"", ""Cold War"", ""Hide"",  and ""Nightmare in Silver"" all resolve on deus ex machina.)

(Although I will note that ""Journey to the Center of the TARDIS"", despite being frequently identfied as having a deus ex machina ending, does not actually have one: Everything used to solve the problem is clearly pre-established earlier in the episode.)

The writing in S7 was just absolutely dreadful. (And not just because of deus ex machina. That's just a really easy, quantifiable thing that you can point at.)

Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith were all so young that they didn't really need men companions -- they *were* the beefcake; they didn't need a young buck (like Capt. Jack) around competing for female eyes, so they tended to hang out with fetching young women.

When Traughton was traipsing about, though, he was old enough to be a grandfather, so he picked up a young Jamie McCrimmon -- a man's man, a Scottish highlander, a fella that would just as soon punch you in the face as have a beer with you, and would gladly do both.

There's two problems there. First of all under money laundering laws the bank is very clearly at fault if they have any suspicion about the transaction. For years now it's been the case that banks can't just turn a blind eye and get on with it.

The massive fine in the USA for facilitating money laundering. It's a literal fact that HSBC have indirectly caused deaths in Mexico. Without a way for the money to be laundered, without a remuneration the drug cartels would vanish. 

We cannot blame HSBC in one breath for not asking questions and then berate them in another for doing it.

Secondly it's vulnerable people that get scammed by phishing etc. The point at which the vast majority of phishing is caught is when the money tries to exit the system. Staff being vigilant in branches helps a great deal.

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"**ONE: THE WRITING IS BAD**

S5 was wildly inconsistent in its quality, but Moffat's scripts were strong.

S6 deteriorated further and Moffat's scripts started showing a lot of problems.

The scripts in S7 were almost universally terrible and Moffat in particular turned in some truly awful writing. ""The Day of the Doctor"" was a welcome burst of excellence, but ""The Time of the Doctor"" went back to being a pretty bad tour de force of deus ex machina, poor pacing, and shallow exposition masquerading as characterization.

**TWO: MOFFAT SEEMS TO BE OUT OF IDEAS**

Moffat has had four major finales (if we include ""The Time of the Doctor""). Three of these finales have featured an assassination plot on the Doctor which results in the creation of an alternate universe that's rapidly collapsing until the Doctor exploits a loophole that reboots the universe. Three of these finales have also featured messages being ""beamed throughout time and space"" and causing a huge alien armada to respond. Three times during these finals the Doctor has looked up to a huge fleet in the sky and said, ""I haven't got a plan! But you're so scared of me you're not even going to come down here!""

That's a major example, but glance around and you'll find Moffat cribbing from himself all over the place. RTD had the same problem towards the end of his tenure and it's one of the reasons I was glad he left.

Personally, I'm really hoping Capaldi represents a big reboot for Moffat and that a fresh approach to the Doctor will invigorate him and leave him exploring some new ideas.

**THREE: THERE'S THE SEXISM THING**

Which, personally, I think is overblown. But Moffat does have a really noticeable problem writing female characters.

Tom &amp; Lorenzo said something in [their review](http://tomandlorenzo.com/2013/12/doctor-who-the-time-of-the-doctor-2/) which I think is really insightful: ""Also, we spent most of Tasha’s scenes trying to figure out how River Song got a new body and became space-pope until we realized – with no small amount of shock – that she was merely Moffat’s latest attempt at writing a woman character, which means she’s exactly like his last attempt to write one. It’s actually embarrassing when you realize that he didn’t write a new version of River Song, he wrote a completely different character who sounded EXACTLY like her (“Hey, Babes.” HEY BABES? ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING US?), was also referred to as a psychopath, and can fly the TARDIS, because he literally cannot write anything but two types of women: the randy, adventurous middle-aged woman, and the wide-eyed, supportive, “assistant” girl with a mystery in her past. That’s IT. That’s all you get with him; endless cheap ripoffs of River Song and Amy Pond.""

(Although, really, it's just endless ripoffs of River Song and Madame de Pompadour, since Amy herself is just ripped off from ""The Girl in the Fireplace"".)

And the observation that all he can write is River Song and Amy Pond remains true even when the randy, adventurous middle-aged woman is also a lesbian lizard. (To be fair, of course, that's totally different because the lesbian lizard has an assistant lover who is wide-eyed, supportive, and has a mystery in her... past... Dang.)",0,1390642536,null,0,false,0,ceyg2xu,t3_1vyy4g,t1_ceyg2xu,t3_1vyy4g,null,1432099653,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

&gt; *The investigation further revealed that drug traffickers were depositing hundreds of thousands of dollars in bulk U.S. currency each day into HSBC Mexico accounts. In order to efficiently move this volume of cash through the teller windows at HSBC Mexico branches, drug traffickers designed specially shaped boxes that fit the precise dimensions of the teller windows. The drug traffickers would send numerous boxes filled with cash through the teller windows for deposit into HSBC Mexico accounts. After the cash was deposited in the accounts, peso brokers then wire transferred the U.S. dollars to various exporters located in New York City and other locations throughout the United States to purchase goods for Colombian businesses. The U.S. exporters then sent the goods directly to the businesses in Colombia.*

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"This has some truth to it, but at the same time, London does receive a level of investment that is simply too high, even when taking the increased need into account. For example the government spends £70 per head in London on culture, this figure is £5 per head in the rest of England.

They talk about HS2 bringing jobs and money to the north, but the single largest beneficiary is expected to be London, by £3 billion. The next largest will be Birmingham and the Midland, who will only make £1.5 billion. Wales, Scotland, East Anglia and Bristol are all expected, in the worst case scenario, to lose hundreds of millions of pounds between in economic effects, not even counting how much will be lost from tax money to build the thing.

They're talking about building *another* airport in London, even after copious extensions to the existing ones; new cycle paths; a bridge that is also a garden.

Meanwhile Manchester airport has to look to Beijing for investment, the rest of us deal with a slowly decaying 60s railway and dire need of urban renewal and new industries.

Does London *need* all these things? Of course not, but because it helps the City to function more efficiently, and because our politicians minds get exceptionally hazy when thinking about anywhere else in Britain we are left with a situation where London receives an extraordinary amount of political attention and government investment, wgilse the rest of us suffer because of it.

Regarding the result against Liverpool, I have said since the start of the season that this is a transitional year for us. We have nearly finished clearing the high earners, and our new players are starting to gel. We are essentially building the club from scratch again, so it will take time for us to be successful. I imagine next season will be difficult too, unless we manage to sign some already-established players. 

Signing-wise, I'm not too sure about Grant Holt. He'll provide an experienced head to advise/mould our younger players, but I can't quite see what he brings to the team. It also worries me that we're signing loan players from Championship clubs. I couldn't be happier with the signing of Ryan Bertrand though. I've always been an admirer of his, and I would love it if we could make the move permanent in the summer. 

I think we should try to sign a creative midfielder, minimum, this window. Not sure Wes Hoolahan fits the bill, but then again, who else can we attract? I'm of the opinion that Jack Grealish should break into the first team next season, but we also need a bit more spark in the middle now.

It takes quite a lot of balls to commit suicide. The methods currently available are ones that you really have to think about. Hanging yourself, overdosing on pills, slitting your wrists, electruction, drowning, jumping off a building; all of these things require a huge amount of courage and rock solid determination to go through with it and succeed. Many people bottle it. Those who don't are truly determined to die and have been for a long time.


A gun would make it so, so, *so* much easier. You just pull the trigger. A shot of whiskey and a few deep breathes, count to three and close your eyes, bang, job done.

In one of the books detailing the history of Bletchley (I'll dig out source eventually) one of the code breakers recalls a war time visit by representatives from the American [OSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services).

The visitors could not believe that all the work was being done in tin sheds and that all intercepts were kept in row upon row of tatty, dog-eared shoe-boxes.

He remarked  ""Right now if this operation was being put together back home we'd have the whole thing housed in a secure bomb-proof building and these boxes would be in one giant room and they'd all be made of steel. Of course needless to say all the boxes would be empty.""   

And there you have it. Bletchley will probably become a slick museum and visitor attraction to cater for the [RCH](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=R.C.H.)-concentration span but in doing so it will lose its essential Blectchleyness - that the whole point and beauty of it is that it was fundamentally a 'lash-up' a Great British compromise that forgoes looking good for getting the job done.

As Joni M would no doubt say 'it's all a bit tearing down the trees to build a tree museum'

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;Bird spent his final hours illegally sawing down a 12-bore shotgun - used to fire 31 of the 54 rounds aimed at his victims. The other 23 rounds came from his .22 RF rifle.

[This image shows the Shotgun and Rifle - not sawn down to any great degree](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3440301/Weapons-used-by-Bird-revealed.html)

He injured 11 and Killed 12, 13 including himself. Of the murders, six were with the .22 rifle, though the victims were sometimes shot with the shotgun first.

[From the inquest reports sequence of events:](http://www.epcollege.com/EPC/media/MediaLibrary/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/F%20Inquiry%20Reports/ACC_Chestermans_report-%282011%29.pdf)

The first 3 murders were with the .22, 
Then 3 was injured with the shotgun.
He then shot a woman twice with his shotgun, but the fatal shot was delivered by the .22 rifle after a struggle.

He then shot and killed another man with the shotgun before injuring another with it, then another man was murdered with it (After a 14 year old girl was missed, twice with the shotgun at close range).

A female was then shot twice with the shotgun, but again the fatal wound was a .22 shot to the head.

Then he murdered one and injured another with the shotgun.

Two more people were then shot and killed with the shotgun, and a furhter person injured with it.
A cyclist was then shot in the neck with the .22 and died.

Another female was shot in the head with the shotgun at point blank range and died, before another two women were shot in the head with the .22 but survived and soon after a further two victims who were shot with the .22 and survived. He then abandoned his car after it punctured a tyre, and took his own life with the .22 rifle.

Despite all of that, statistics indicate that you have around a 90% chance of survivial if you are shot - it is not the instant and inevitable death that hollywood would have you believe. Nevertheless, a .22 is clearly and demonstrably an effective and lethal weapon. Anyone who has shot one will treat them with the respect any firearm deserves. They are powerful, they CAN AND WILL kill, just like any firearm.

To characterise them as 'less dangerous' is in itself dangerous. Treat all firearms as what they are: Lethal. Even air weapons.",0,1390651421,null,0,false,0,ceyhamb,t3_1w1kdt,t1_ceyhamb,t1_ceyg5yt,null,1432100268,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Without the UKs EU membership an independent Scotland will almost certainly;
&gt;
&gt;* lose the UKs currency opt-out and be forced to adopt the Euro
&gt;* the judicial opt-out would be lost
&gt;* the British Rebate, worth £5b per year, would be lost

The UK has [three opt-outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Former_opt-outs):

* Schengen. Also granted to Ireland, and I don't see any particular reason why it wouldn't be granted to Scotland. Its only land border is with another non-Schengen country (rUK), so from the rest of the EU's POV there is no material difference if Scotland is in Schengen or not. The UK has a partial opt-out from the [AFSJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_freedom,_security_and_justice) but this is essentially the implications of Schengen for cross-border policing.
* Euro. Also granted to Denmark, and given the political situation in the UK (there is no great demand for the Euro) I don't see any reason why that wouldn't be carried forward. If it wasn't, there is no requirement for immediate adoption. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden are all in the EU but not the Eurozone - without any formal opt-out.
* [CFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union). The UK opt-out was primarily to ensure that UK citizens could not take cases to the European Court of Justice. The [treaty itself](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) is pretty straightforward - no death penalty, no torture, intellectual property exists, innocent until proven guilty, etc.

The UK also enjoys a rebate, which is currently worth about £5bn (so say £500m to Scotland, on a roughly per-capita basis). 

However the rebate is based on the amount that the UK pays in to the EU relative to the amount it receives (if it pays in £100, and receives £70, it gets 2/3 the difference - or £20), has been reduced by 20%, is likely to be reduced further, and would be much less significant given that Scotland would make a smaller contribution to EU funding.

The UK's opt-outs/special treatment are things that are either unlikely to be an issue (Schengen), are not in fact an immediate requirement (Euro), or would not be not particularly significant to Scotland (CFR and rebate).

---

&gt;

&gt;**Operation Carthage**, on 21 March 1945, was a controversial British air raid on Copenhagen, Denmark, during World War II. The target of the raid was the Shellhus, Gestapo headquarters, in the city centre, a building that had been used for the storage of dossiers and the torture of Danish citizens. A similar raid against the Gestapo headquarters in Aarhus, on 31 October 1944, had been successful.

First of all, all you need to do is watch one PMQs to see both sides use different stats about the same thing to say they're right. Stats, unfortunately, can be spun in a way to say whatever.

Secondly, one reason people are so apathetic about Politics right now is because we're being asked to make decisions on macro ideals that are too complex for even the best Politicians to get their heads around, let alone somebody who works a full time job and has kids to raise.

Thirdly, the specific issue of immigration is far too hard to quantify. This is, in part, because the benefits and costs of immigration go way beyond 'do they have a job'? it includes costs to welfare, costs of children, does their wife work etc? The benefits also need to factor in how immigration brings in new skills and actually creates jobs by making business more viable....And that's all before we even touch the social arguments about immigration and integration.

So long as Politics is based around asking the population to make massive decisions about how we should be as a whole, rather than how we feel as an individual, frustration with the political process will continue to spread. It also means that the real ability to make decisions is taken out of our hands and our confusion allows for manipulation.

true,EpicFishFingers,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,"Not easily concealed, takes a fair amouint of skill to fire accurately, the projectile plugs the wound if it pierces flesh (I don't doubt that they would pierce flesh), I doubt the UK market would allow the sale of barbed-headed arrows (although I just did a quick search and [I'm wrong about this](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/6-x-ARCHERY-ARROW-HEADS-HEAD-COMPOUND-BOW-BROADHEADS-POINTS-/111260126717)), 'ammo' is also hard to conceal. Whereas with a pistol you might be able to shoot from the hip and not give away completely the fact that you are about to fire a gun (or that you've just fired one), with a bow and arrow everyone will see you take the weapon off your back, take out an arrow from your quiver, pull back the bow and fire it at someone. Your fingerprints will also be on the tail end of the arrow.

Crossbows might pose a threat but I believe I looked into buying one of those a while ago to hunt wabbits and ran into licensing problems (I was wrong again, using them for hunting is illegal and selling crossbows to someone over 18 is legal, but it turns out that [using broadhead arrows is illegal](http://www.crossbows4u.co.uk/#/uk-laws/4527582693)

That said it isn't difficult to buy broadhead arrows and criminals won't worry about the law, but a lot of the problems of bow and arrows apply to crossbows (can't be hidden easily, especially because of the wide head of the weapon, ammo can't be that easily hidden unless you make some kind of insert in a jacket to store the arrows, bowstring requires strength to pull back).

So it's easier to use a shotgun if you have to kill someone, as the only downside of this compared to arrow-firing things is the noise",0,1390656250,null,0,false,0,ceyi154,t3_1w1kdt,t1_ceyi154,t1_ceyh57s,null,1432100661,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,EpicFishFingers,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,"Are you seriously implying that mutually assured destruction (MAD for short, appropriately) is a good preventative measure?

Why raise the already level playing field? For every case of mobility-scooter lady with a gun against an unarmed burglar, there will be a case of the same lady against an armed burglar, or other person (armed or not) against a burglar who gets the drop on the people inside the house by just bursting in and pointing a gun at everyone, knowing that the owners will not have time to draw any gun of their own and fire before he fires (nor will anyone else present in the house want to risk trying to shoot the burglar before he shoots at the family).

Kreeping Iran and NK away from nukes is also not entirely working. We can't invade NK without angering China who they're allied with, so trying to stop them will only result in us being attacked, so we're put in a position where we just have to leave it and hope we can talk them out of an attack, or hope they're too impaired to develop the weapons. Same thing applies for any other country with the right allies or in the right position etc. Imagine how Japan felt if they'd have known abotu the atomic bombs the US were developing and aiming at them during WWII? Now imagine how they would feel if you told them ""well you'd better get building a bomb of your own so you can fire it back at them once they launch.""

So going back to canyoufeelme's point: everybody owns a gun. Okay so things are the same as they are now, except in order to feel safe, everyone must buy a gun and know how to use it properly. Ignoring deaths by guns misfiring, ignoring accidents involnving improperly secured guns, ignoring even the obvious access to guns it will allow criminals, what happens when the government changes its mind again and bans guns? You just know at least some of the guns will fall into criminal hands, where they will the only be used for no good.

- Suarez really wants to score today. You can tell he's up for this one.

- Jones needs to sit on the bench unless Mignolet is injured. I agree with the article written by David Usher saying your 1st choice GK should play every match. Backups only used in emergencies. He is a liability.

- We've been poor but still have the lead. Score again and we can look at making a few subs.

The reason for many drug fatalities is their very illegality- unregulated dealers cut with other substances and people are generally uneducated in their proper use and effects. They are also less likely to seek help, since drugs are illegal.

Guns are for killing, illegal or not. A spliff is not a gun. If we legalise drugs we allow regulation and purity *and* we take money away from the gangs who would potentially use guns to enforce their trade, as well as tax revenue to treat misuse and educate on proper use. If we legalise guns, we're just adding more guns.

true,EpicFishFingers,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,"Yes I'm aware. For a large amount of money you buy a gun case that satisfies a certain british standard which I won't dig up (basically it has to be bolted securely to the wall, floor, or both). You must have the only set of keys and only you must know where the spares are kept.m You pay £50 for the license, and however much for the guns after the fact. Meanwhile an officer inspects your gun case and probably talks to you about it (this is assuming you give good reason for the license in the first place, and self defence is never considered such a reason). Then you can buy shotguns that fire no more than 2 or 3 shots before requiring a reload, there are restrictions on where you take the guns, the ammo to be used, etc.

So why introduce more?

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"&gt;When your only basis for reintroducing a temporary tax which has since been abolished on a regular basis is that the people who have calculated it raises no money are wrong and that there is a broad principled claim that the tax should be paid then it should be obvious and apparent to everyone that you have no evidence, logic or rationality behind the move.

I take this to mean that you believe Balls' argument to be two fold. One side is that people ought to be 50% on income over 150 thousand pounds even if it is not helps the rest of society less than taxing them at 40% for earnings over 150 thousand pounds. I agree with you there. You view his second reason to be that he believes the government evaluation got it wrong and that Labour's have got it right. This is where I start to disagree with you, because you seem to be claiming that the figures Balls is quoting are somehow inferior to the ones the government quote before removing the 50% tax rate. However I don't understand how you have deduced that Balls' figures are wrong and that the Conservative' figures are correct. Furthermore you've claimed that because Ed Balls' figures are incorrect (which remains unproven) he therefor leaves no reason for this other than populism. However, this all hangs on whether or not Ed Balls' or the Government's figures are correct and I don't think we should make the judgement without an understanding of the facts. Government figures are going to be just as biased as Labour figures so we can't just assume that one of them is right. If you could argue effectively for why the Conservative figures are correct and Labour's incorrect, then I would have to agree with you that Ed Balls' move is populist, but we can't make that judgement yet which is why I invite you to provide proof for the economic argument otherwise I, and everyone else, have no option but to remain apathetic and unconvinced in either direction.

In contrast, the Vietnam war protests gathered steam during that war, and arguably played a part in the US withdrawal. 

[BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2885179.stm)

&gt;The relationship between the military and the media has always been uneasy, due mainly to the fact that each has sharply differing aims. While the military sees propaganda as a weapon in itself, a journalist's role is to cut through the half-truths and report both sides of the story.

&gt;In the Vietnam war, the tie was stretched to breaking point, with Washington blaming reporters for fuelling anti-war protests. The backlash came in the form of heavy restrictions being slapped on journalists - hence the tight controls in the last Gulf War.

&gt;All that seems to have changed with the switch to embedding.

[A more in depth analysis by the right-wing US RAND corporation](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG200.pdf)

&gt;While the military and the administration sought to maintain
public support for the war through optimistic briefings and relatively
conservative body counts, the press sought to report the “whole story”
of the ongoing conflict and used its access to provide graphic televised
images and vivid stories that often belied the “official” accounts.
Press-military relations soured as the war became protracted and as
political consensus on the U.S. role in Vietnam began to break
down

Unsurprisingly, the RAND corporation analysts tend to regard the role of the press in Vietnam as unfortunate, and the news management achievements of embedding as a success.  That doesn't change the accuracy of the analysis.

In all seriousness;

* No, you have no legal obligation to contribute to the boiler repairs. Beyond that it's a matter of respect - would you give me, a total stranger, say £100 for nothing? No, of course not. So why give your landlord - someone who already gets more money out of you than they should extra cash.

* However, your options are limited in making him pay for the repairs. You can theoretically get the council out to do a health and safety inspection and they can then *""compel""* the landlord to make necessary repairs - usually through a campaign of letter writing but eventually legal action if needed. **However**, it will take weeks to get the council interested and even longer to get them out... then the criteria the council will look for are fairly narrow (like is your life/well-being in danger) which is largely subject to interpretation, and like all well paid staff they will usually interpret it in the way that generates the least work for them... which is to tell you to do one. It's effectively up to them to take your landlord to court on your behalf and even if you convinced them to do that, by the time it got anywhere near a court your landlord will have turfed you out at the end of your contract for causing him trouble. 

* By contrast he can secure a section 21 notice against you very quickly through the courts of within 4 weeks notice if you are on a rolling 1 month contract.

* In a nutshell, you are between a rock and a hard place. Push too hard and you'll get given notice before you ever see a new boiler. Don't push and you're going to have a chilly February.

* If you are ""burning your bridges"" and are moving at the end of a fixed contract regardless of the outcome of this boiler business, an approach that I have used in the past is to threaten the landlord that you will take out an advert in the local paper (or the local paper where he lives) and tell everyone what a despicable human being he is for leaving you to suffer the winter without a boiler. But this is a very high risk strategy and when I did it I said it 100% fully prepared to see it through (as it was a matter of principle and not of money).

* Alternatively you can just find somewhere else to live, give notice and get out as soon as the contract allows and, (optionally) on your way out tell him he's a cunt.",1,1390660518,null,0,1390660947,0,ceyiwtf,t3_1w448r,t1_ceyiwtf,t3_1w448r,null,1432101001,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

* Very well played defensively. Skrtel and Toure did a fantastic job, as did Kelly/Flanagan/(to an extent) Cissokho. Our defense saved us the game today.

* Gerrard looked a lot more effective covering Lucas today. Wouldn't say he's there yet, but much more promising than against Villa.

* Aside from the few selfish moments mentioned above, Sturridge and Suarez continue to link up well. Fantastic moments of play from both, once they started getting service when our midfield woke up.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"Solid match. Started off shaky, but that could be put down to the fact this isn't a formation we've played recently and therefore took the team a while to grow in confidence. Hendo and Gerrard playing deep midfielders worked well today, we looked a lot more solid on the flanks and consequently in the middle of the defense as well, while SAS played to their high standard.

I think we may well have seen the formation Rodgers plans to play vs. Everton. This formation solves a lot of the problems injuries have caused for our team. It negates the offensive deficiencies of Cissokho and Kelly, while it retains the penetration through the flanks via offensive wingers. Moses put in a good shift today and it may well be that on tuesday we see him start again with Sterling on the other flank.

The other issue this formation solves is who to play in midfield and how to play them. There was some discussion recently about playing Hendo and Stevie in a box to box capacity but I think they were playing even more conservative today. It really looks like this is the midfield setup Rodgers will have to use if he wants to use Gerrard in a Pirlo-esque capacity.

Overall a positive match that solves many issues the team has these days, mainly due to injury. Would have been nice to see more of Aspas/Ibe/Alberto but imho part of the reason we didn't was because this was also practice for tuesday and Rodgers wanted a good look to see how such a formation and the players in it function.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Have a read of [this](http://www.landlordlawblog.co.uk/2013/11/11/lessons-from-germany-on-rented-housing/). It'll be good for two reasons; Firstly it'll demonstrate to you that tenants in the UK have far fewer legal protections than in many other western nations. In particular the absence of both tenure and rent control go strongly in favor of the landlord financially. Similarly, the fact a landlord can secure a rapid section 21 eviction notice through the courts in a fraction of the time it takes a tenant to have necessary repairs made to a property, which may even be endangering their life is staggering. 

The second reason it'll be good is for your future business, because right now the whole ""generation rent"" thing is in its infancy, but when these kids in their mid-late 20s hit their 30-40s and are still stuck renting, with kids and a greater likelihood of voting you'll find that reform of the rental sector will probably determine the outcome of a general election (in the way economic reform largely determined the last, and NHS reform the one before that). I wouldn't be surprised if the outcome of that reform was to remodel the UK sector on the German or US systems which offer more legal protections to tenants (more so in Germany but in some respects the US also). The tradeoff for that will probably be more legal power for landlords to reclaim money if their property is damaged by tenants - beyond the value of the damages deposit, which seems fair to me. 

In a nutshell, enjoy it while it lasts - because I suspect in the next 10 years the party on BTL is going to end with a thud.

What you've said above is just total nonsense, you could go through a court and get an eviction notice very quickly if a tenant failed to pay rent. In fact it's one of  the few things a tenant can do that a court will issue a rapid eviction order for. Even in a dispute, tenants should still be paying rent. The fact you don't know this or haven't done it makes me think you're probably running a pretty amateur operation and exemplify the typical BTL landlords that dominate the sector at the moment. I'd sooner see them pushed out of the market by larger US-style rental agencies which are forced by virtue of their size to operate more tightly within the law.

They have. Obviously that isn't very fun if your a recipient of welfare but I don't think you can call it populist, since they generally play down just how extensive their reforms have been - which actually seem to be motivated by economic reform rather than a genuine malevolence towards the sick or needy.

People in the UK don't generally vote for political parties because of how harsh they have been on other demographic groups. It's no use finger pointing at benefit-hating daily mail readers and blaming them for *populist* Tory policies aimed at pleasing them. That group will vote based on the positive benefits that THEY will receive, not the ones that benefit recipients WONT receive. So populist policies of the Tory party are really things more like the promised EU referendum (which we all know the cabinet don't really want)... but are aimed at pleasing a particular (large) demographic of older white voters that typically vote Tory.

Holt - can't go too far wrong, even if he's rubbish we have several other strikers and I think he'll bring a bit of experience and leadership to the dressing room. We lost a lot of threat when Gabby went off for Holt vs Liverpool, but Holt did a great job of holding the ball up and retaining possession. He calmed things down.


Liam Bateman - haven't seen him play that much, just the odd NextGen game. He didn't strike me as one that is likely to make it to the Villa first team but you never know. I really hope he can recover and go on to have a good career.

You'd also be very silly if you just cashed that kind of money in a bank and used it to pay your mortgage... far better to hive money off into other investments to diversify your income to make more money from it. Since effectively, someone earning £75,000 a year still has a similar expenditure to someone earning £30,000 a year. Their food costs the same. Their petrol costs the same. Their clothes cost the same. That isn't to say they can't get more expensive equivalents of those things, but my point is the money they earn over around £30-35K is largely disposable income... so it makes sense to hive it off into investments rather than just save it in a high street bank account like you or I would. 

So their take home pay is made up of lots of smaller pay packets that vary hugely month to mongth. E.g. a salary of maybe £100K. Rental incomes of maybe £10K, Shares and bonds of maybe £10K, consultancy/freelance work of maybe £30K spread across perhaps 5-10 different companies. 

Very few people beyond high paid professionals like University vice-chancellors, Head teachers or senior Doctors take home a single pay packet that large. Company directors in particular will be taking it home is all sorts of weird and wonderful things like car allowances, director bonuses etc. Often people earning that sort of money also have an international element to their work (and pay) which adds a whole other dimension of complexity.",0,1390663853,null,0,false,0,ceyjs82,t3_1w40ei,t1_ceyjs82,t1_ceyhltj,null,1435518432,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Now add in every other criminal thats reactivating or importing guns and you pretty quickly get above a few hundred.

&gt;The **Danegeld** (/ˈdeɪn.ɡɛld/; ""Danish tax"", literally ""Dane tribute"") was a tax raised to pay tribute to the Viking raiders to save a land from being ravaged. It was called the geld or gafol in eleventh-century sources; the term Danegeld did not appear until the early twelfth century. It was characteristic of royal policy in both England and Francia during the ninth through eleventh centuries, collected both as tributary, to buy off the attackers, and as stipendiary, to pay the defensive forces.

true,d_r_benway,null,null,"&gt; Gun crime rose after the handgun ban.

How many massacres have we had since?

&gt; If the current controls were in place when he committed the crime he merely would have used a rifle/shotgun. 

You know that for a fact - do you not think increasing the amount of weapons will increase the possibility to a fucktard getting hold of one.

&gt; In the US some of the the states with the strictest controls have some of the highest levels of gun violence whilst the some of the states with the least controls have the lowest level. There has never been any correlation found between gun control and gun violence.

Totally invalid point. If you live in a state that doesn't allow guns, but that state is next to one that does, guns are going to travel over state lines.. It's like the German's moaning about weed availability near their border. 

&gt; Advocating gun control for the sake of the children is the same as advocating drug prohibition for the sake of the children. It makes the misinformed and the hysterical feel better but it has no basis in evidence.

Only keeping drug illegal results in more dangerous drugs - i.e weed sprayed with silica, 'bad' ecstasy mixed with PMA, ore people going blind drinking moonshine during prohibition, and more dangerous for the buyer (having to mix with criminals). 

Having legal guns isn't going to make the gun industry kill less people - legal drugs is likely to cause deaths due to quality control - how would this result in less deaths with gun legalisation.

Drugs at the worst are going to harm the user, guns could harm/kill anyone - guns always have the potential to be  dangerous - their primary purpose is to kill things, unlike say cannabis.

One other side effect of this legislation would be that ALL police would have to be routinely be armed  - this would result in more criminals wanting guns also = more people dead.

If we legalised guns but not drugs then the drug world would become far more violent than it already is.

My reasons for thinking pistols should be legal (I think i'm in the minority here in that I would prefer US style gun legislation) is that  the government should have to provide a very strong ""why"" for banning something, and I don't think it has done at all. 
The argument for banning guns is usually ""guns are used to kill people"", but this ignores why people kill each other, and so people just kill each other with something else, as noted by the murder rate not decreasing when handguns were banned. I've just done some (admittedly pretty basic) correlation calculations on between the gun ownership rate and murder rate, and between the gini index (an inequality index) and the murder rate, and I get a correlation of -0.1 for gun ownership and murder, and +0.55 for gini index and murder. So if we want to stop people killing each, we should be fixing inequality, not banning guns.

These same fucktards can get a hold of a rifle or shotgun with the current legislation. There's nothing stopping 5 million British citizens acquiring a legal firearm this year. Expanding the type of weapons available doesn't necessarily mean a marked increase in the number of citizens owning guns (especially if we limit handgun ownership to say people who have owned a rifle for five years).

You've yet to present any evidence that greater gun rights = greater gun crime.

Gerrard played in Suarez but was wrongly called offside when one on one with the keeper. 

We had some problems down our right in the first half because Suarez/Sturridge weren't tracking their runners when they were wide right. The free header from the corner was a mistake caused by Skrtel being off the pitch (no one made sure that someone picked up Skrtels man), which was our worst spell in the game with Gerrard filling in at centre half for possibly the first time in his career. Fwiw, although they didn't show the replay I'm fairly confident that it was offside against the Bournemouth fella in the lead up to the Gerrard yellow because Steven was the last man, looking across the line and then stepped up. Hence why he was so pissed off at it. Beyond that most of their shots, as you say, were from the edge of the box and through a load of bodies and usually blocked. 

&gt;it's just that we had a final ball while they didn't.

Well this is the key thing isn't it? Penetration. And exactly how'd you expect a game between top Premier League and good Championship sides to go, all games ebb and flow particularly away from home.

---

&gt;

&gt;A **Danish pastry**, sometimes abbreviated **Danish** especially in the United States, is a viennoiserie pastry, of Viennese origin, which has become a specialty of Denmark and neighbouring Scandinavian countries. Danish pastries are popular around the world.

&gt;It is called wienerbrød (Danish pronunciation: [ˈʋiːˀnɔˌbʁœːˀð], lit. ""Viennese bread"", corresponding to the French Viennoiserie) in Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway and Sweden. It is referred to as facturas in some Spanish speaking countries.

&gt;In Vienna, the Danish is referred to as Kopenhagener plunder or Dänisher plunder. Like other viennoiserie pastries, such as croissants, danishes are made of laminated yeast-leavened doughs, creating a layered texture similar to a puff pastry.

No one man is bigger than the club. Mata was our player of the season for the past two years. He made an otherwise ordinary team seem special, defined who we were and was exactly the player we needed. Emphasis on needed. He will always be remembered as the player who took those two corners in our European finals and brought finesse to our game. I don't want people to refer to any potential new signings as the 'new Juan Mata' because that would just do an injustice to what Mata did for us. As I suggested earlier, he was the player we needed in those two seasons but with the emergence of Wilian, Hazard and Oscar with Mourinho's style of play we don't need him anymore. It would be an insult to a player of Mata's quality to be sat on the bench as a plan b. As Mou said, it is best for the player both professionally and personally to move away to a club in a league he loves that he'll get regular football 



Power to Juan Mata. 2011-13 were his years for us. I will wear my shirt with his name on the back with pride and always remember the genius he brought to the club.

The fact is you have just pissed me off by your comments, who knows you piss someone off where guns are more available you may get shot

---

&gt;The **line of succession to the British throne** is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom. The line is identical in all other Commonwealth realms.[n 1] The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics. The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.

true,notsurewhatdayitis,eng-yorkshire,East Yorkshire,"&gt; Similarly, the fact a landlord can secure a rapid section 21 eviction notice through the courts in a fraction of the time it takes a tenant to have necessary repairs made to a property, which may even be endangering their life is staggering.

Spoken like someone with no experience. You can get a boiler replaced in a couple of weeks. It'll be months before you manage to get a date at a county court for an eviction hearing if the tenant refuses to leave.

&gt; What you've said above is just total nonsense, you could go through a court and get an eviction notice very quickly if a tenant failed to pay rent.

Then why are landlord forums stuffed full of landlords at their wits end who have been faced with months of delays because the county courts are so stacked out they're not able to get hearings for weeks and months later?

&gt; Even in a dispute, tenants should still be paying rent. 

 I do know they must continue to pay rent however that still doesn't alter what I was on about which was tenants that don't pay.

&gt; The fact you don't know this or haven't done it makes me think you're probably running a pretty amateur operation and exemplify the typical BTL landlords that dominate the sector at the moment

Go fuck yourself you fucking cum gobbling arsehole. I bend over fucking backwards for mine, even overlooking the fact they smoke in the property even though the tenancy doesn't permit it and I'm about to go fix the fence they fucked.

Both goals were counter attacks as such, and maybe a lot of the team saw this as an opportunity for free goals and went too offensive I don't know. Demichelis should have had it covered, the goalkeepering wasn't fantastic, but I don't think joe would have done much more.


Kompany came on for Rodwell and relived his more youthful days. I have to say he was fantastic as a CM. Similar to Toure, a bit like a steam train going through a cardboard box factory. The second half was just a barrage of attacks, with the occasional scare on the counter but was handled far better with Zaba and Kompany now on the field. It's as if Pellegrini made the team more defensive without actually sacrificing any attacking power.


The team looked like they missed Negredo until Jovetic came on, I wanted him to come on for Dzeko but Pellegrini stuck him on the wing where Rony seemed to be awfully quiet. He was quick, saw gaps and frankly impressed me more than I thought he would considering his recent injuries. 


The strikers were as you would assume, Aguero a lit cannon, and Dzeko being a wet sock.

Pre match. Mate pulled out of going to pub, so am at home watching this.

- Robles is shifty, Stones will front the blame for that early chance- but he should have collected the cross earlier in the phase. 

- Stones is also shifty, obviously. Hopefully he can get some more confidence with experience.

- Naismith- right time, right place. 

- Camera needs a bigger hood, keeps picking up the floodies. 

- Stevenage are showing how to play against us, get in our faces and do what we did to Arsenal. Better than most PL teams thus far. 

- Robles doesn't come for another cross. Hibbo saves the day.

- Really smart through ball by Oviedo there, he is a tricky player when he cuts inside. If that was Gerrard they would have replayed it 5 times. Naismith just a yard short of pace to get on it though- still, the sort of pass out game has been missing recently. 

- Barry is just so good at everything. His first time balls are a really underrated part of his game. 

- NO. NO. NO. NO. OVIEDO D:

- Classic Osman Finish

- PRAY FOR OVIEDO

- Aguero in disguise up top here today. I remember he played like this vs Tranmere pre season before his full team debut, thought we had a player back then.....

- Commentator just said that Stevenage average under a goal per game- the side I have seen thus far does not look like one that should struggle so much to score. #MagicOfTheCup",0,1390671477,null,0,1390673245,0,ceymcga,t3_1w4gb9,t1_ceymcga,t3_1w4gb9,null,1432102658,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

true,Nungie,EN,england,"All these managers are indeed top managers but none of them build teams like Pep and Mou. Klopp did a fantastic the last couple seasons with Dortmund but this season they're about 13/14 points away from top. Wenger is certainly underrated and I can fully see where you're coming from there. The youth development and the money being made from that being pumped into the club doesn't help him and now that they have money to spend Arsenal are going to be much more formidable if he keeps signing top top players. The Invincibles was an incredible feat and not just any manager could've pulled it off so I agree with you there. Ancelotti is a tricky one, won plenty of titles so I'll agree with you on that one but inconsistent to say the least. Simone has done a good job at Athletico yes. BUT to say any of these managers are better than Pep and Mourinho is nothing short of insanity. Pep has built the greatest club side the world has ever seen and made the greatest player in the world what he is today. His Barca team is still what Barca is today and behind the wheel of Bayern everything is going to be a cakewalk for him. Mourinho won the CL with Porto. Porto. He then moves to Chelsea and right after The Invincibles wins back to back PL titles toe to toe with Wenger and Sir Alex. He then goes to Inter Milan and wins Serie A. No problem next season I'll just get the treble. Goes to Madrid and ends the Barca dominance. Setting records almost every season. And now he's back at Chelsea. See at pattern here? Success goes where Mourinho goes. All of Chelsea's success has been built around the team Mourinho built and the players he made into world beaters. Lampard Terry Cech Drogba and even Cole(I know he was already amazing) have been omnipresent during all of our success.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; You can get a boiler replaced in a couple of weeks

How exactly? The only route of recourse in this situation is to approach the council on your behalf and it is largely up to them to decide how they proceed. The tenant has virtually no legal protection and even the definitions over what you can and can't complain about could fill textbooks of case law. I just don't agree with you that it is difficult to obtain a possession order. It requires an element of jumping through legal hoops and it costs money - granted. However it isn't particularly time consuming. I've seen landlords obtain possession orders in as little as 2 weeks. Infact, the government are so nice to landlords they even go so far as providing them with a helpful electronic version of the [possession order forms](https://www.possessionclaim.gov.uk/pcol/) to speed up the process. You won't find a government portal allowing you to complain that your life is in danger because your landlord won't make even the most basic repairs to their property, or to complain about damp and mould throughout a house.

I do have some sympathy for where a court warrant for possession is then required. (i.e. the possession order is granted but the tenant still refuses to leave, and so must be physically removed) - but again, it can be done VERY quickly. Where I've seen holdups is where landlords are using their own tenancy contracts that haven't been passed by a half-decent solicitor, and the courts can't enforce something if it wasn't in the contract. Therefore they end up stuck in a device of their own making. But this is also partly due to the amateurish makeup of the market - it's dominated by middle aged BTL landlords with no experience in the industry, who've acquired a large lump of money (almost always through familial inheritance) and decided to recreate themselves as a landlord. It wasn't such an issue a decade ago when private single rental property owning landlords made up a tiny fringe of the market. But now we are talking about something like 25% of the housing market and growing at a phenomenal pace. What it desperately needs is the emergence of larger businesses that run 20-30 properties instead of ""John the Builder turned BTL landlord and his 2 rental properties"".

---------

&gt; Go fuck yourself you fucking cum gobbling arsehole

ooh dear, touched a nerve have I :) you might be sick to death of ""wankers like me"" but I can't say many tenants are that fond of their landlords either. I would love to know what portion of BTL landlords have ever been tenants themselves and if so in what conditions. I'd wager very few - and that is a great shame, as I think they tend to get tunnel vision and fail entirely to empathize with the poor souls they rip off on a monthly basis. I can't wait to see the industry get overhauled and see the back of the amateurs. BTL'ers have had their fun - now its time to modernize and turn it into a respectable industry run by medium sized businesses.

Loanees cant play against their parent club in any competition unless there is a specific clause in the loan deal. This isn't common among most clubs, as they dont want their own player scoring against them or anything like that.

Then there is this thing called being cup-tied. It is used to describe a player who is ineligible to play in a knockout cup competition after transferring from another club during that competition.

In virtually all domestic and international club cup competitions, any player who makes an appearance for a club at any stage of the competition is ""tied"" to that club for all future matches during that season in the same competition.

So Borini wouldn't be able to verse us for that reason. Also, if he had come on against Notts County in the Capital One Cup 3rd Round earlier this season he wouldn't have been able to play for Sunderland in that competition.

So if you buy some coffee beans and equipment from your overseas distributor, that's a cost to your business but presumably a profit to theirs. And then you sell it to UK customers, which is definitely income generated in the UK. But then you consider the Starbucks brand, the logo, branding, marketing etc which is all owned by a US company. And also consider that the US parent company might open up 100's of branches in the UK, causing huge losses for many years even though the UK stores generate £m's of revenue. It can all get quite complicated. And sure, the companies might abuse the rules but it's incredibly hard to crack down unless you can get all other countries in the world to also re-write their laws to complement ours.

The problem really comes become profit is essentially an artificial construct. You can adjust your figures to make profit larger or smaller depending on what you want to do.

&gt;**Møns Klint**, (English: the Cliffs of Møn), is a striking landmark and tourist attraction along the eastern coast of the Danish island of Møn in the Baltic Sea. The bright chalk cliffs stretch some 6 km from the park of Liselund in the north to the lighthouse in the south. Some of the cliffs fall a sheer 120 m to the sea below. The area around Møns Klint consists of woodlands, pastures, ponds and steep hills, including Aborrebjerg which, with a height of 143 m, is one of the highest points in Denmark. The cliffs and adjacent park are now protected as a nature reserve. Møns Klint is popular with tourists from across Europe with some 250,000 visitors a year. There are clearly marked paths for walkers, riders and cyclists. The path along the cliff tops provides impressive views and leads to steps down to the shore in several locations.

They would say that there were no targets but there was an amount set which the DWP top brass had decided somehow was the amount of sanctions they'd expect to be made day to day in your average JobCentre. These were monitored at individual and site level and were taken into account when evaluating overall performance of a JobCentre.

On an individual level, if you were seen to be sanctioning at a lower level than expected, you would be monitored closely and if it were to be judged that you were not sanctioning appropriately then your job could be in jeopardy (or at least that's how we were threatened).

At a site level, all Jobcentres in a geographical cluster are judged on a number of metrics including but not limited to: time taken for a new claimant to re-enter the workforce and amount of sanctions applied. When the tougher sanctions regime came in lots more importance was placed on this metric than had been previously.

true,Learnincurve,derbyshire,Peak District,"This is another reply I made. The fact that people would try and pit one kind of cancer against another because of an agenda makes me really fucking angry. 

The thing about prostrate cancer compared to breast cancer is that it's a old person's disease, you have an increased risk at 65+, in fact they think that the stats may be much much higher than those recorded because the chances of you having stage 1 are enormous once you hit 80, they just don't check for it if you die of a heart attack.

Stats for Breast cancer on the other hand show that it rears it's ugly head from age 25+.

It is a mistake to compare the two or the funding for them. Breast cancer is far more comparable to testicular cancer, not in stats but in the method used to check for both is pretty much identical, and this is another mistake prostrate cancer awareness campaigns like this one make is not actually saying what the symptoms are.

Like the charity, dislike that this ""test"" is the pure unadulterated bullshit of the MRA. If they really wanted to help they would have contacted the cancer research charities and put out the questions they wanted asking. They had a golden opportunity to gather some solid data that could have helped far more than any money and they blew it.

1st half: Shit shit shit shit shit shit shit. Lescott and Demichelis as a CB pairing is like watching two freighter ships lumber around. Let's never play them together again unless we really have to. Yaya was anonymous. Sergio hardly got a touch. Kolarov was last season's Kolarov. Lopes showed signs but needs a little more blooding in to the side to be fully up with it. It was just dire. No real cohesion in the side. 

2nd half: Much much MUCH better. Vinnie came on and went up to each player individually pumping them up, getting them geared up. He commanded his defence beautifully. Constantly shouting to everyone when to play it, when to leave it, where to be stood. Everything was ran to his orders. Demichelis played a lot better as CDM than a CB and I'd be interested to see him in that role a little more. Yaya stubbed his fag out and decided he'd start playing football. The Lesser Spotted Jovetic was spotted and was looking pretty good. I'm excited if we can get him fit and keep him playing. Aguero was finally involved and we profited.

All in all it went from being a drab, awful match to being an incredible one (from a sky blue point of view). I would commend Captain Kompany though, he came on and gave the team a bit of fights.

Kinda. But if you're going to do a lot of trips it's going to be easier, more flexible, more relaxed and ultimately cheaper for you to hire a bike privately or bring your own. This is because the Barclays bikes are setup for commuters doing ~20 minute journeys - they get rather expensive after that and aren't available everywhere, etc.

&gt; I'm also thinking about flying with my bicycle and just ride them around London, and perhaps travel with them to other cities. Can I bring my bicycle with me on a train?

Usually, yes - it'll depend on the train where you have to put it. Avoid rush hour as there are extra rules and it'll just be annoying/dangerous for you and others. I've never heard of an additional charge except for Eurostar or other obviously-special trains.

&gt; Also, if I do decide to bring my bicycle with me I'm going to have to bring them in a box or something, right? What good bike shops in London can I go to to have them reassembled?

Pretty much any of them will do it, but most bike box setups do not require a bike shop to re-assemble. I doubt they would charge you for checking it over though (it's a weird English thing) or for doing the stem properly with a torque wrench, but I'd probably buy something random in their store as a thank-you anyway.",0,1390683990,null,0,false,0,ceyr68z,t3_1w4w9v,t1_ceyr68z,t3_1w4w9v,null,1432105151,3,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,3

true,Spaghetti_Head_Man,lfc68,,"""Most recently Ayre has overseen what is most likely the greatest 'bait and switch' maneuvering ever seen in world sport involving the transfer of players. Under Ayre, Liverpool have tracked a number of players in recent transfer windows and 'leaked' to the press the 'intentions' of securing their signatures, which then sparked a last minute bidding war among several clubs. Clubs like Chelsea, Borussia Dortmund, Tottenham and Manchester City have 'pipped' Liverpool at the last minute to several players whom were thought to be close to signing for Liverpool, paying over the odds prices. Ian Ayre and Liverpool have received much criticism for failing to secure the signings in a timely manner. With the latest transfer 'debacle', it has come to light that what Ayre is actually doing is forcing clubs like Tottenham and Chelsea to purchase expensive players who end up making a very small impact at their new clubs. Stefan Jovetic, Eric Lamala, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Henrikh Mkhitaryan come to mind. Chelsea nipped in at the last minute and signed Mohammed Salah 'out from under' Liverpool, but what Chelsea have signed is a player with a built-in controversy, Salah is a well known anti-Semitic, having caused his club Basel embarrassment and criticism by refusing to shake the hands of players of the Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv before Champions League qualifiers. Ian Ayre has perfected this 'bait and switch tactic, while Liverpool's real targets such as the outstanding Luis Suarez, Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge are signed with no competition.[3] The club's owners, Fenway Sports Group, led by John W. Henry and the chairman Tom Werner, announced Ayre as the new Managing Director on 22 March 2011.""

It's a team game and without the players ahead of him being compact and doing their responsibilities Gerrard was always going to get exposed vs. Villa. Go back and watch that game again and look at the difference between Sterling's defensive position in the first and second half.

They are also considered a long-term thing, with lots of progress marking, so a few sessions to 'try' is going to nothing.


I got my referral through my GP after telling her the paper materials were doing nothing for me, however depending on your region, some adult mental health clinics can have self-referral admission for appointments, so you may be able to bypass your GP.


I also had a session with a pair of mental health workers, and saw a PCT (Patient Centred Therapy) counselor provided by my university while I was there, but I didn't find the 'so what do you want to talk about today' approach very useful personally.


The best I guess I can give is see ANY kind of counselor or therapist, and tell them this.  I'm not an expert in the mental health side of the NHS, but I know there are many sides of it, and someone who works in it should know where to direct you.  Also, if you do go via your GP again, you can just walk in and say ""I've had it for a while... seen many doctors... medication... its not helped... I would like a referral to the adult mental health clinic"" without needing to convince the new GP, as it's all on his computer anyway.

Other than this I can't think of anything, I just wanted to make sure you weren't fobbed off thinking CBT was like the booklets I was given.

Forgive me for dragging this back to the serious, but I know plenty about the taxi business, and the people in it are damned if they do and damned if they don't. I just finished my eleven fucking hour shift earlier this evening, as a taxi controller, and I get to see all sides of it.

Driving taxis, and especially minicabs, is an unloved and unrewarded pursuit. It's a low-margin business mostly populated by the uneducated and unaspirational, generally blokes who know how to work hard but little else. In the taxi business there is a metric fuckton of chancers and tossers who deserve every brickbat they get; and there are rather more conscientious grafters who try harder than people on many times their income, who learn to laugh off the ridiculous and thoughtless dismissal of their labours by confirmation-biased people who mistakenly think they know better.

For every fucktard you notice pulling a three point turn in front of you, there's another two or three trying bloody hard not to ruin your day, annoy you, or get your shit wrong. There are lots of idiots in the business, because it pays shit, there's no income security, and you need little more than a driving license, a CRB, and a reasonably clean record to get into it. In return you get to throw stupid hours at ingrates and pompous dicks, and thankfully lots of nice, grateful people too. At its worst it really isn't fun at all; at its best it's modestly rewarding but still chuffin' hard work.

Unfortunately the taxi business is largely predicated on price, where cheaper equals better. In this regard the punters are myopic. If they want a better service from better trained and educated drivers they should pay more, simple as, but that ain't gonna happen anytime soon\*.

Yes, I realise this a venting thread that isn't very serious (we're in the fucking pub fer chrissakes, what else should I expect?), so I went ahead and vented. Denigrating cabbies is every bit as fun as casual sexism and racism - to some degree we all indulge from time to time, because it's fun and there is undoubtedly a kernel of truth to some of it, but it's still a disservice to the ones who just want to do a good job.

More practically, what to do when a taxi driver reverts to dickhead mode? Don't bother with the taxi company, just get a registration number or a plate number, and ring up your local authority's licensing department *pronto* and file a complaint. I work in this business and I would dearly like to see off the jackasses who drag it down for the rest of them. Yes, this requires a level of action above and beyond vague moaning.

... aaaaaaand *breathe*.

\*Actually, it *is* gonna happen fairly soon. The taxi trade is going to be swallowed whole by driverless cars in the next decade or two, and in the meantime it will likely be royally shafted by VC-funded megataxicos like Addison Lee who can raise the eyewatering investment required to put it on a more professional, orderly footing.

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***White Cliffs of Dover***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%20Cliffs%20of%20Dover) : 

---

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;The **White Cliffs of Dover** are cliffs which form part of the English coastline facing the Strait of Dover and France. The cliffs are part of the North Downs formation. The cliff face, which reaches up to 350 feet (110 m), owes its striking façade to its composition of chalk accentuated by streaks of black flint. The cliffs spread east and west from the town of Dover in the county of Kent, an ancient and still important English port.

&gt;The cliffs have great symbolic value in Britain because they face towards Continental Europe across the narrowest part of the English Channel, where invasions have historically threatened and against which the cliffs form a symbolic guard. Because crossing at Dover was the primary route to the continent before the advent of air travel, the white line of cliffs also formed the first or last sight of England for travellers.

It is unusual, outside of a small number of mostly professional jobs to get paid in a single monthly ""salary"" like you or I might. In reality their pay often gets made up from a large salary yes - but also separate private consultancy work, investments, international work, possibly things like patent-holdings, royalties, rental/property incomes, stock dividends, bonds etc. 

What my post above was demonstrating is that someone earning £75K has effectively similar living costs to someone earning £35K... so that extra cash is in essence disposable (non essential) income. But because it is so much larger they can be far more flexible with how they invest it. It means money is coming in and going out in more complicated ways than 12 single PAYE installments at the end of each month. Each of those things also has specific tax complexities associated with it which further complicates matter - even more so if the acquisition of that wealth spans several national borders. It makes taxing it very difficult - especially considering these people tend to be innovators and job creators that the government are keen to please.

I'm just trying to paint a picture of the complexity of how these kind of salaries come together. It isn't that the government are willfully complicit in giving a group of people an easy ride - it's vastly more complicated than that.

I think they do.

It's the pensioners that need to understand that they cannot be exempt.

There is absolutely no justification for giving free travel, free TV licenses and the winter fuel allowance to the richest of pensioners; none whatsoever.

It's right that there is a welfare state to support those that need it, but it is NOT right that some benefits are made available unconditionally to those that don't actually need it.

So actually, welfare makes up the third largest part of government expenditure. Considering that the NHS ""costs what it costs"" and pensions are long term expenditure that is wrapped up in laws means welfare is the **largest single modifiable** source of government expenditure in 2014. i.e. they spend slightly more on healthcare and pensions but are relatively limited in how much they can save from those two departments, however they can cut welfare. 

It seems entirely reasonable that the government should target welfare as part of their austerity drive. 

I've got no idea where you got that 2% number from?... possible unemployment + housing benefit but that is deceptive because of the way benefits are classified in the UK.  But in essence no, the welfare state is absolutely huge and I can't see a rationale argument for not trying to constrain it. It's good because it reduces state expenditure, and it gets people back into work increasing both the size and competitiveness of our labor market. The issue is finding a balance where you aren't unfairly punishing those that cannot work - and while I will concede that the scales have tipped slightly in favor of the government, welfare in the UK still remains very competitive compared to the support offered by other nations.

Yes, but I'm confused about what point it is that you are trying to make as paying freelancers gross is not illegal and nor should it be.

There is no distortion of rules here, any unintended consequences or even a selective reading of the rules - it is entirely legitimate not to make deductions for freelancers as you are shifting that compliance burden onto them.

The only real saving is of time and paperwork rather than money as the tax on that wages still gets paid, just by the freelancer directly rather than by you after deducting it at source.

Believe it or not the Labour Party does not actually control what their leader does if they happen to become Prime Minister.

If that's what you are suggesting then where does it stop; do we carry on and blame the all the trade unions and their bloc vote at the Labour Party conference?

There are lots of unions that I would consider to be a useless shower of cunts, but that doesn't make them war criminals.

Were you?

I can't speak for anyone else, but we didn't know then what we know now and *at the time*, it seemed like it was the right decision and for the right reasons.

Not acting at Srebenica was the wrong decision but Kosovo was the right decision, as was Sierra Leone and and the other military actions at the time and Iraq seemed right too.

While the specific money raised by the higher rate would bring in a specific pot of money, the effect on the treasury would quite probably actually result in less money being paid due to reduced investments, capital flight and the like. We call this 'tax income elasticity', and depending on what that number is the tax will either bring in or cost money (more specifically, whether or not it is 0.4 or 0.5)

There have been numerous examples, from Sweden to France, America to Britain, where it has proven that it can be revinue optimal to reduce the highest tax rate with regards to getting the rich to pay more.

I am more than willing to consider some arguments from people who can give me some quantifiable data that Brown's initial assertion that TIE was 0.35 and so the tax made sense, or that Balls has some proof that the current valuation is wrong, but at the moment all we have are counterassertions.

true,crazedandabused,null,null,"I have been in therapy for different reasons, off and on, since I was a teenager.  I'm from the US, but I now live in the UK, and every member of my family deals with some sort of mental health issue.  I have just spent the last two years living with a suicidal teenager whom I had to get into an inpatient treatment facility, my son is in individual therapy, and my partner and I have just stopped couples therapy. I say all of this just to let you know I've been around and done most of it. 

You are right to want therapy, medication and therapy should go hand in hand. The meds make it possible to deal with all the shit that got you there in the first place.  But getting good therapy in the UK is difficult.  I truly believe that a therapist is something you need to shop for. You really need to jibe with your therapist, they need to get you, and you need to get them. For instance, personally, for me, I CANNOT see someone who doesn't have a sense of humor. I rely on mine too much to get me through the worst times to spill my guts to someone who doesn't get it. I one time saw four therapists before I found one I knew I could work with. But when you find the right one it's like striking gold. 

Now, using the NHS, or any of the mental health services that are available, when you can get someone to listen to you (my son and foster daughter both had trouble getting help), you are put on a waiting list and you have to take the therapist you get, and if you don't like them, then you are put at the bottom of the waiting list again. So, it's impossible to shop for a therapist.  However, if you keep at them, you can eventually get the help you need. For my foster-daughter, to get anyone to listen to her, to get her any sort of therapist, after two trips to A&amp;E following suicide attempts, I still had to call every day. Every single day I called someone. The first numbers we got were from the A&amp;E for different services, and as soon as you talk to one person they will tell you someone else to call to do what they can't do. And I did that for a couple of months before getting her in with someone.  So it's possible, you just really have to be persistent, let them know what kind of trouble you are in, and how badly you need help. Then keep calling.  Eventually they get tired of hearing from you and do something. At least that was our experience. 

However, if you go private, then you can shop. ( I was anxious to try because private therapy in the UK is much MUCH less expensive than it is in the US.) The bottom line is that no therapist should stare at a clock and say nothing. I have never had that happen. I've had ones that I couldn't work with, but I think you got a really bad one, and shouldn't write them all off because of that one dumbass.  I have found a great private therapist, and she gave a great recommendation for a private therapist for my son.  They have both been wonderful, and well worth the money. 

So, I would say you are your best advocate. Get on whatever waiting lists you can, keep calling, talk to whomever you can, keep demanding help.  And/or maybe try another private therapist.

A question like this may generate a very minimal version of conversation, but I wouldn't call it *discussion.""  The only actual discussion happening here is our little sub-thread, for which I actually upvoted you.

And I would say that, yes, googling something can indeed create conversation.  Actual informed conversation, such as if OP had worked out the tiebreaker system and then created more interesting threads like ""*Why* is goal difference the first tie-breaker, and why have we sucked at GD for the past two years?  Does GD disproportionately hurt defensively-oriented teams?  Does that mean we should REALLY be buying a better strikeforce so we can outdo our rivals in GD?""

To smokey's point, I don't think we're short on topics of discussion.  It seems to me that we generate more than a page of new threads per day, and much more immediately before and after matches.  Whenever I'm away for a couple of days, I find I have a LOT of catching up to do, since I like to read almost everything on the sub.  I'd rather have fewer but deeper threads than more but shallower.

Also, for some people it just smacks of laziness.  People should be proactive about their own edification, especially when it would actually be more efficient than asking the sub.  And in this case, 3-4 people spent as much time composing responses as it would have taken the OP to figure it out for him/herself.

Internet space is not in short supply, but people's time is, and the question wasted several people's.  Sure, they could have ignored the question, but as you say, this is a community, so by self-selection we are not inclined to do so.  That doesn't mean it's not still a waste.

Again, I am not a downvoter, but I do sympathize.


tl;dr: Answering trivial questions is not real discussion, and it wastes people's time.  A quick internet search could have facilitated a much more useful thread for the sub.

This isnt to say that the Ban necessarily caused that, but it didnt seem to have a positive effect, certainly not the sort many people assume. Britains low murder rate isnt from the recent 1997 bans, its been like that for decades if not centuries. It was a safe country, as safe a country, before the bans.

It is starting to go back down now. But still worth comparing with other countries. Most first world countries have recorded a gradual decrease in violent crime and murder rates over the past few decades, regardless of whether gun laws got stricter, looser or stayed the same in the respective countries. A demographic shift, or other social issue is more likely to be the cause for that.

For instance, Canada's rate has been steadily dropping since the 70s, before we had any gun laws to speak of(full autos allowed, carrying handguns allowed) and further gun laws being added(and recently repealed) doesnt seem to have affected that steady rate of decline.

Similarly, the USA, which has gone through a lot of different firearms laws in the past few years(some stricter federal ones being added, and removed(AWB), some states getting stricter others loosening off) generally getting more permissive since the late 80s(it is now legal to carry handguns in almost every state) has seen nearly a 50 percent reduction in murder over the past few decades.

Im not some nutter who thinks taking away guns is going to result in an explosion of violence, I just think in the grand scheme of things if they affect things at all one way or the other, it is generally insignificant compared to other indicators of violence like poverty, social safety nets, imprisonment rates, disenfranchisement of minorities, education, prevalence of gang warfare and other prohibition fueled crime.

As for the dog I have in the fight, to be honest I dont really have one. I have certain rights(well permissions in this case) that I enjoy here, and I would like my friends in the UK to be able to enjoy them and other ones as well. I spoke up against some of the increased surveillance, internet filtering your government is doing to you guys, for example. Not that it affects me at all.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I understand that position: And I agree, I don't think that banning handguns is a panacea . Likewise, I don't think ALLOWING them again is a simple move.

Ultimately it seems to me that having outlawed handguns, it is very difficult to say 'Well, we didn't have handguns for 17 years, but now we're going to allow them again. With that we accept that we increase the pool of firearms that are both desirable and available for criminal use, and that some people may die who otherwise would not have done.' It's very hard to make a positive argument for handgun ownership in the UK: Self defence is a no-no, we have no dangerous wildlife, criminals do not routinely carry firearms. You're left with 'Fun and freedom' - which in my opinion does not sufficiently offset the potential for societal harm where widespread handgun ownership is being considered. 

Rifles and shotguns are much easier to make a case for: They are much less desirable and practical in criminal ventures, there is a long tradition of hunting, both for wildlife control and recreation, and a significant economy around hunting. In my mind, the risks ARE outweighed by the benefits, with freedom to shoot if you want to being a good enough reason.

As for you 'having a dog in the fight' - I just wondered what compelled a Canadian to post numerous replies through a UK topic on gun control. Personally, I don't think Americans in particular DO have 'valid input' into the UK debate. They tend to end up insulting our intelligence, or calling us patsys to the state. They simply cannot grasp the *fundamental* differences in the culture around firearms between the two nations. I've long since given up attempting to debate the issue with our USian cousins. I end up getting called an anti-gun liberal, when in fact I have shot all my life, for fun, competitively, and when hunting. Canadians, on the whole, tend to be a little more level headed about the issues.

Ultimately, democratic nations are free to make decisions about such matters free form other nations 'opinion' on it. That's why we find such vast difference in both laws and opinions between countries.

What is actually interesting is that overall, the strongest link can be made between the drop in violent crime, and the fall in use of leaded petrol. I'm not even kidding - normalising for various nations rate of uptake, and allowing lag time for young males formative years, the BEST way to make a country safer is to ban the use of leaded petrol - which we've all done.
