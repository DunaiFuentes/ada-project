Drawn out over time, this could lead to the financial ruin of these Financial trusts. Who would be left to fill the void? Private providers.In essence, the fear (in my view warranted) is that NHS service provision will diminish greatly, and the now deeply fragmented provision of UK healthcare will be of lower quality than of the NHS had just been bloody well left alone. I work in the NHS, and to my knowledge there hasn't been a single major government 'reform' bar budget changes that have benefitted the NHS as a cost effective service provider for decades.

Life got really busy, I'm at a new job where I don't have the free time like I did at my last job and I'm on mobile a lot which makes most moderation actions hard (Basically anything other that removing reported posts is a giant hassle). If it looks like it's going to stay this way past the new year, I'll probably give up my mod position to someone who has the time to handle it properly. Not an excuse, just stating where I'm at.

With that being said though, I take some issue with some of the things you've said.

&gt;First there are this lot - blatantly all the same person:
http://www.reddit.com/user/sallybluesally
http://www.reddit.com/user/spagettibonetti
http://www.reddit.com/user/alberthammond3
http://www.reddit.com/user/droymickey

No offense, but what do you expect us to do? Looking across all four users that you posted, not a single one of their posts were reported and some of them actually have positive scores. We can't solve problems we don't know about.

Looking beyond that though, now that it has been pointed out as being an issue, what do you expect us to do? Even if we had solid evidence that those four were the same person and I banned them all right now, they would just create new accounts and it boils down to a time consuming game of whack-a-mole. 

So where do we go from there? Do we ban the domain totally from the sub? Well, looking at all articles posted from cfclatest (http://www.reddit.com/domain/cfclatest.com/) a fair number of them are in the positives, so some people are getting value from them. If you think they are low quality crap, that is exactly what the downvote button is for, but until they break our rules or become harmful to our users, I'm going to let the community decide as a whole what they want to see.

&gt; Can't work out if this guy is a spammer or not, he seems to get reddit enough to mix his own blog with low quality text posts - as if he wants to fly under the radar a bit.

Again, what do you want us to do? You even say yourself you don't know whether he's spamming or not. The only solid accusation you make against him is that he is getting on your nerves. I can't really ban him for that.

&gt; Most importantly, please please please ban this dick

This one I can see your point on a bit, it's a bit much without any personal contribution to the sub. He's technically not breaking any of out rules, but he's got a high number of posts in quick succession that are all sitting below 0. Problem with banning him is the same as I mentioned with the first person. If I ban him or even the domain, they will always find a way around that and it becomes an arms race. We'll look into seeing if there is a way, as a mod, to discourage this type of spamming in the future (maybe a temp ban with a reason why), but really the best way, in my mind, is to not give him what he wants -- Traffic.

I said it earlier, but I'll say it again, we the mods can't solve problems we don't know about. I just took a peek at our moderation queue and in the last week we have removed all but two of the links you guys have reported to us. Feel free to message us if you think something is a problem, and we can talk about the issue, but quietly getting angry at things until it boils over does no one any good. We're here to serve you, but we're not mind readers. We can do our job better and easier with your help.

For ex. Did we really need to buy luis? That is very debatable. Bertrand could have been phased in. Did we need to spend on Zouma? I'm sure some youth being promoted would be a viable option, like Kalas, Christensen or Kenneth. 

 Before Matić came along, why didn't Chalobah or Ake get more gametime in that position? I'm sure they could have worked out nicely, and possibly been helpful vs Atlético last season. Solanke could have been useful this season when Drogba was super tired (I think we all saw him fall from exhaustion in the dieing minutes vs Strawberry), but due to lack of experience, wasn't played.

Boatloads of excuses. News for you is that a team relies on its top players all the time. 

Second, if you want to talk about defence and how Rafa was defensive, then go ahead. I'll only point to you what the current philosopher has done to the defence. 

&gt; Rodgers also has had the benefit of managing Liverpool in an era where teams come to Anfield and try and get three points. When Benitez took over, pretty much everyone who came to Anfield besides Man Utd and Arsenal would be more than happy to leave with a point, and most visiting teams had the sole intent of just being frustrating and difficult to play against rather than chase a victory.

Courtois

Azpi Cahill Terry Luis

Fabregas Matic

Schuerrle Oscar Hazard

Costa

Most of those pick themselves, the questions for me are the fullbacks and RW. Given that we will spend most of the game in Schalke's half, I think Luis and Azpi are the best choices to provide width and tight passing. Ivanovic certainly gets forward, but his crossing/decision making leaves something to be desired for me. As for the RW spot, I think Schuerrle's had enough of a recovery period to establish some good form. It's close between him and Willian, but I don't think we'll need the latter's workrate.

If I'm being honest, as an American who never bothered with MLS or the US national team, Yedlin seems like he has ""gotta go fast"" as his only standout trait. That was Walker's problem too when he first got here, so it'll probably be fixed. The only problem for Yedlin is that the competition at right back is too strong- after Walker, it's Naughton.

&gt;Although private schools, including the one that I went to, educate only 7% of children, their students take up almost 50% of Oxbridge places

And what proportion of those private schools are selecting pupils based on academic ability? And what proportion of their students come from homes which promote high achievement (lots of books, parents strict on video games, high expectations &amp;c.)?

This figure is a shame in one sense--but it needs careful interpretation. I don't like seeing it bandied around as Hunt is doing here.

BTW More than 60% Cambridge undergraduates are from maintained schools so he's being a bit cheeky with the stats.

&gt; too many independent schools have become barriers to British educational success

I'm not sure. It's still a majority of state school children who go to Oxbridge (funny that grammar schools are particularly successful at getting them in...) so the barriers can't be too high.

I also find it odd that so much weight is placed on Oxbridge. There are [1,803,840 undergraduates](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/stats) in the UK at the moment only ~1% are at Oxbridge. 

&gt;We want to see more private schools running summer schools, sponsoring academies, assisting state boarding schools and assisting professional exchange.

Yeah, great, but who's going to pay for it? Independent schools don't run at a profit. Other than the fact they're charities so cannot make profit they're always battling to keep their fees down and we should respect that.

Why should parents who invest in private education which benefits society in many ways (increasing per capita funding in the state system, decreasing state system class size, increasing education of society at large) also subsidise a failing state system?

The net result will be this: prices will go up at private schools and the middle-classes will be priced out. More and more will turn to state education supplemented with hours and hours of tutoring which benefits nobody but their own child.

A generation ago a modest doctor or businessman could afford private education for several children. That's not the case any more. I don't see that as a victory for anyone.",0,1416900921,null,0,false,0,cmcf859,t3_2ncmdm,t1_cmcf859,t3_2ncmdm,null,1425851943,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Nobody is suggesting that, mainly because the US system is a mess and evolved as a deformed entity with its roots back in munitions workers strike demands during the first world war - which were never repealed.

If we are lucky we will end up with a European style, which sees free healthcare reserved for the poorest in society, but private health insurance for those who can pay.

Lets address the elephant in the room. The NHS is collapsing. The service is pretty poor, disorganised is the key word, and its amazing staff are overworked, underpaid and neglected. It needs to change and throwing good money after bad is not the answer.

The reason we have disparity in cost and quality between private and public is because the NHS saturates the market, yet doesnt ever seek market value. Its budget is unaccountable to anybody, and very few politicians and beaurocrats have any experience in the real world of asset and capital allocation.

This pushes costs for the competing private sector higher. We can keep the NHS intact, but also bring costs down in the private sector by bringing choice, competition and efficiency to NHS management. 

If we can make private healthcare more affordable, then less pressure is put on the NHS, which is reserved for emergencies and those less fortunate than others. 

If we ended up with something like I have experienced in Spain or Belgium, (which I have experienced), or what I have heard about in Germany - then we will be in a very good place.

Seriously though, if somebody has led you to believe that we are aiming for a US style system, either punch them in the face for being a moron, or cut them out your life for being a conniving, manipulative shit.

The next time that we come close is in *The Three Doctors* when the Doctor himself says:

By this point, of course, we've heard *noone* actually say exactly that.  

The next time that we come close is with Nyssa in *The Keeper of Traken*, when she asks:  
&gt;""But why is it so much bigger inside than it is outside?""  

Adric pretty much restates those words in answer to her, as well, after the Doctor offer a technical explanation.  

The final companion to come close in Classic Who is Mel Bush, not on first arriving (which we don't see, of course) but when she explains to Ace, on *her* first arrival inside in *Dragonfire*:

I suppose this post ultimately boils down to two questions, which you mods can probably help with. First - what do you want this forum to be? Do you want it to be a place for exclusive for medium-high quality content (plus the occasional gif)? Or are you fine with it being lower quality? 

At the moment, I find myself getting a little irritated with a large minority of the stuff I read hear - it often lacks understanding, nuance or is just poor grammatically (I'm a dyslexic writing this on a phone on the way to work - so please excuse the hypocrisy). 

If you want that higher quality work here, it's not about the upvotes - theyre a shit way of telling, I mean one of the most upvotes posts of all time is a picture of Eva - it requires proactive moderation. Youd have to read the comments or articles of most stuff which is being posted. 

I understand that not everything is weaintgotnohistory or u/feroze17 but to say cfc latest isn't shit because it occasionally gets an upvote is wrong.

Secondly very happy to help, but tell me how to get in touch. Do we have to message 7 mods? Or is there someone I can write to? 

Edit: what I really want from you guys is a proactive moderation style. You're bright guys and you're Chelsea fans - if you see something that you think is generic, poorly written or just plain bad - you're probably right!

  My best mate moved out of the country quite a few years back. I do see him quite regularly (~once a year or so) and he always really enjoyed music. With, as above, it nearly being Christmas, I wanted to put together a parcel of say 5 albums that he might have missed in the last few years.  
  
  He's got quite a similar taste in music to me, which is quite varied and often bizarre, but favourites include The Aquabats, Deftones (early), Pennywise, Arcade Fire, Godspeed, Streetlight Manifesto, Propaghandi, Black Keys. I suppose you'd call that a mix of post rock, punk rock, with a bit of ska thrown in and a heavier side of Indy.  
  
  Albums I'm tossing up getting for him: 
 
  [**Royal Blood** - Royal Blood (full album)] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6GhA5bULnA)  
  
  [**Turbonegro** - Party Animals (playlist)] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEeLxJs28-Q&amp;list=PL359A546AE3EA9403)  
 
  [**Black Joe Lewis** - Tell Em What Your Name Is!!! (playlist)] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnWebXmSYgQ&amp;list=PLMB-JbXUE4Uqh9qon3dmlJV7lmdUKQSm7)  
 
  [**The Heavy** - The House That Dirt Built (playlist)] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrlfeUJHsrI&amp;list=PL6E994AACE35659A1)  
  
  [**Ben Harper** - Welcome To The Cruel World (playlist)] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPvV4bOoc_8&amp;list=ALBTKoXRg38BCVClRlKbdmDKhA9WsOgT30)

false,king_duck,null,null,"&gt; In the ""golden age"" of council housing (1950s - 1970s) they were definitely considered a long-term solution, both by the tenants and by local and national governments. At the peak (which iirc was the early 70s) nearly half the country's population lived in council houses, and the majority of the housing stock was good-quality, spacious, and well-maintained.

Well that's all well and good, but as a tax payer, I am not really in favour of that at all.

Also wasn't that era when all the grey homogenous tower blocks were being built, I don't think most people would like to live in those now. In addition, we are now more crowded then we've ever been and land, especially in cities, is at a premium.

It seems to me that winning the FA or League Cup is merely used as cheap banter (i.e. images of empty trophy cases, etc).

Somewhat disappointingly, the business of football has shifted to prioritize Champions League play because of the money and prestige wrapped around the Champions League. Hell, the impact of the Champions League is so great that in order for the Europa League to stay relevant, interesting, starting this season UEFA will now allow the winner of the Europa League qualification to the Champions League (took 'em long enough!).

For LFC to have sustained long-term success, we need regular Champions League play. I prefer the economic reality of a top 4 finish to the sentimental collection of a FA or League Cup trophy.

false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"Another brilliant, level-headed column by Paul Tomkins. I think he really nails it on the head. The unfortunate reality is that *money* is what will ultimately drive long term and sustained success in the Premier League and constant Champions League qualification.

In regards to LFC, the basic solutions are:

* Expand the stadium, generate more revenue.
* Get Champions League and then (a) get more prestige to lure top players and (b) have the money to pay those top players.
* And then get Champions League again to lure top players and have the money to pay those top players.
* And then get CL again to lure top players and have the money to pay those top players.

There's a clear pattern there.

Once that pattern is established... *then* you can tinker with the machine a bit and try to do the things that will get you to win the title, win the Champions League. Usually that means hiring that manager who can lead a team to glory.

A lot of faith and trust has to be put on FSG as well. And, frankly, I *do* trust them.

Sure, they don't have Roman Abramovich money or Middle Eastern oil money to throw around for some quick fixes... but, guess what? They're still a business. They're run by people passionate about sport. They're people who want to make money and know that winning will make them money.

I always got the impression that Hicks and Gillett viewed LFC as a pet project that became an annoyance. FSG seems to actually care.

Sure, the start may have been bumpy but they are neck-deep now and they're not afraid of that. Stadium expansion progress has been agonizingly slow, the so-called transfer policy - which nobody *really* knows what that is, if there even is one - has been frustrating.

But it's not as if they don't have the money, they're just getting their feet wet and figuring out on *how* to effectively spend the money. But I truly believe that after some time of steadying the LFC financial ship, expanding the stadium, developing young players, they'll be ready to identify and fearlessly pull the trigger on the top talent to get us there.

Am I impatient? Yes. Am I frustrated with the results? Yes.

But I am not looking at short-term glory, I am looking for sustained long-term financial prosperity which will ultiamtely result in continued success in the League (and titles) and in the Champions League.",0,1416911732,null,0,false,0,cmchino,t3_2nahf5,t1_cmchino,t3_2nahf5,null,1425850713,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I don't know whether you've played or watched sports but this is a general theme among most of them, the coaches/managers are there to plan, the teams are there to execute and there is always a leader/captain amongst the team either officially or unofficially and is their responsibility to lead and in a way go to war with them.

A lot of people who have your thought process don't really get sports because you look at this move by Gerrard as having power over Rafa like a business board room move or something and not Rafa allowing this move to happen for the good of the team, because sometimes as knowledgeable a coach may be there are some things they just wouldn't understand like a player would.

Gerrard's in the team because he's the captain and while that may annoy some people and they don't agree with it there are reasons that a reasonable person would see why he still is. He's the most experienced player on the team and a household name in football that may offer some security to some of the other players around him and that is worth its weight in gold, Rodgers himself is inexperienced at this level and there may be things that Gerrard can offer to him too and i think most importantly is respect. 

Gerrard has done a lot in staying at the club and playing for Liverpool and if it means giving him more time towards the end of his career so be it. If Gerrard stays in the side and we finish outside of Europe it doesn't matter Liverpool will have other opportunities to become a top tier team but the moment we start thinking things like ""Hey I know you've given your entire career to the club when you could've gone elsewhere and won more trophies but because you're not as good as you used to be you can sod off now"" is the moment Liverpool stop being Liverpool and if anything in Gerrard's final years it wouldn't hurt to give him a try at least.

I've got to thank Yates for everything he has done for the club, on and off the pitch. He took over after one of our darkest periods in memory and turned us around, when it looked like we were on our way out of the football league. People will look back on results like the 6-5 vs Burton, the playoff semi final vs Torquay, the run to the playoffs the following year, the FA Cup runs to third round matches against Tottenham and Everton, and most recently the 5-0 win over Swindon. Not to forget what he also achieved here as a player and captain.

Unfortunately lately results have slipped in the league, and while we are 6 points off the playoffs, we are 18th and have only collected 2 wins in 12. Ultimately the timing is right for both the club and for Mark to move on, and I wish him luck in his future career.",0,1416915570,null,0,false,0,cmci85l,t3_2ncv4s,t1_cmci85l,t3_2ncv4s,null,1425850383,1,false,LeagueTwo,t5_2wn55,1

The level of pension they are receiving collectively far exceeds the amount they paid in due to much longer lives than before and significantly higher costs of living. 

Then problem is when the system was set up it was effectively a ponzi scheme, where current taxpayers pay pensions for all retired people now, and future taxpayers will pay for them when they retire. Like all ponzi schemes this is OK when there are more net new taxpayers than net new pensioners. However due to longer life expectancy and lower birthrates, this isn't true anymore, so we have fewer people paying pensions for a larger group.

false,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;Their population is 20 times the size of ours

And their country is 40 times larger than ours. So what? The only way to look at this is per capita and percentage of total.

In terms of [CO2 per capita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions#List_of_countries_by_2012_emissions_estimates), we produce about 5 times as much as India, and a little more than China, although less than half as much as the US or Australia.

Now let's look at renewable energy generation. China is actually the [largest producer of renewable energy in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources).

Comparing renewables as a percentage of total power generation, China ranks higher than us by 3 points. Even India is only below us by 0.2 points. Unsurprisingly, the US is behind us by 5 points.

We're not doing too bad (the US is just abysmal). But my point is that even though China and India are supposedly technologically behind the UK and the US, they actually put a lot of investment into renewables and continue to grow their renewable energy generation at a far greater rate than the UK or the US.

The assumption that people make that India and China will just keep guzzling more and more fossil fuels until they outproduce us all is false. They know just as we do, that fossil fuels aren't infinite, and they can't rely on other countries for sources forever. They are shoring up their energy supply with renewables faster than we are. If we don't use our superior technology effectively now to build up our own renewable sources, we're going to be the ones buying energy from them in the future.

In any case, we can hardly tell them off for using fossil fuels when they produce less CO2 than us and produce more renewable energy that us can we?",0,1416917001,null,0,false,0,cmciiqa,t3_2n9l3h,t1_cmciiqa,t1_cmcf6k3,null,1425850246,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

 Thought Lambert got the starting line up spot on but his subs cost us the game. I don't think Darren Bent can add anything in his current state, he doesn't win headers, doesn't run behind, can't hold up the ball. I understand that Sanchez was tired, but Lambert didn't even put anyone in his role to sit infront of the defence. Also don't think the changes and sticking out Gabby on the left helped for that goal

Obviously Andi and Gabby have to take the blame for that goal and Andi missed an absolute sitter (although his play in the build up was fantastic.. also did anyone notice Westy absolutely busting a gut to try and get in there?).


Credit to Clark though, him and Okore limited Saints to half chances. Clark is a bit of an enigma but his performance yesterday was as good as any I've seen this season in our backline. Genuinely think he suits being the leader at the back, constantly tried to push the defence forward in the first half and most of the second half (until they were instructed to sit deep). I actually thought it was one of our strongest partnerships so far this season. Of course this is all based on one game and our defenders can be both excellent and awful, just look at Vlaar, at times he looks concrete and other times he looks awful

His conviction in the seemingly implausible led a lot of other team’s fans and the media to compare him to David Brent. A character whose confidence spills over into cringing delusion. Rodgers' belief was ridiculed because he had nothing at Liverpool to back it up with. His first season was nothing to write home about but there were small indications of progress. He trusted his players by allowing them to make mistakes, encouraged it even, especially the defenders. Praising bravery rather than criticising errors. It's easy to imagine that the manager's positivity created an environment conducive to playing creative, enjoyable football. Which Liverpool duly did. Suarez became the focal point, Rodgers handled him excellently, if at arms-reach. Along the way Rodgers sharpened up his own appearance too. Second-place last season, one of the top scoring teams in Europe and the buzzing play-style was an impressive transformation in just over a year. It was vindication for the manager and one-in-the-eye to those who laughed at his initial ambition. Rodgers was given the LMA Manager of The Year Award.

*The second act*: Somewhere around Early July Alexis Sanchez decided to move to Arsenal instead of Liverpool as part of the Suarez deal. Now came the tricky part, the unplanned, the unexpected. Nine players were bought in for a serious outlay, ""covering depth"", ""providing options"". It's clear now there was no plan 'B' to replacing Suarez, just a mad dash for whoever was available. Since then it has been a tough spell in total with few bright sparks.

As a fan, I have been itching to see this bad spell, I want to see how Rodgers will handle it. So far he has shown (infuriating for some) dogged determination to stick to his principles, to those that bought him success. He resolutely believes in his judgement as many around him begin once again to question and ridicule it. By now, many other coaches would have hastily abandoned the passing, ball on the floor, risk-heavy set-up he favours. Sam Allardyce recently picked him out as a coach that is unable to change style, inflexible therefore predictable. Rodgers took on Balotelli and rather than playing to his strengths, has tried to mould him to fit the Rodgers-style: workrate, passing, tracking back.  Rodgers has a philosophy, a vision and an unswerving belief that his way will eventually produce results. We played Chelsea last season and tried to outscore them, needing only a draw and got beaten. We played Chelsea this season and tried to outscore them again, and got beaten. He did surprise by playing a different defensive-style against Real Madrid and got results from it.Then frustratingly reverted back to plan 'A' as soon as the game was over.

Last weekend against Crystal Palace the wheels came off for all to see. Even Rodgers' most loyal supporters now have questions, their faith is shaken. He’s had bad luck with injuries, new players to integrate. perhaps more importantly, is his vision, his belief, too big, too ambitious? Has he tried to change too much, too soon? It is going to be interesting what happens from here, there are echoes of his failed spell at Reading where stubbornness and baffling decisions saw to him. Rodgers still has the choice to abandon his unswerving conviction for a while and accept that his admirable philosophy of beautiful football could, at times be a hinderance rather than a help, or... does he keep on believing?",0,1416918936,null,0,1416919167,1,cmcixwz,t3_2nctfw,t1_cmcixwz,t1_cmchzoq,null,1425850049,25,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,25

More cycling and less traffic isn't the answer (to this particular problem). It would certainly reduce the severity of the problem, however.

Less traffic won't eliminate the people who are bad drivers. Even if just 0.5% of drivers are bad drivers - and don't use proper observation, then that would mean cyclists are interacting with dozens of bad drivers every day. You would need to all but eliminate all motor traffic - commercial and non commercial, in order to not interact with at least one bad driver per day.

And was we know, reducing the amount people drive is a very difficult thing to do.

Targeting bad driving practices directly would be a far more effective solution. But this in itself is quite difficult. A punitive approach to bad driving would have absolutely no effect on people who think they're good drivers 'because I haven't had an insurance claim in 30 years' or some other nonsense.

For example, in my day as a professional driver, I often see people driving round with their mirrors folded in, with their indicator on permanently, with windows obscured by frost/mist/etc. If you were to ever approach someone like this, they'd dismiss anything you'd have to say. 

I once drove a theatre director to work - she knocked over a cyclist, and for whatever reason couldn't drive from then on. It turns out she made a left turn without checking her nearside door mirror and sent an approaching cyclist flying. When I suggested that it was her fault due to poor observation - she dismissed my comment, stating that she is 'a safe driver, the cyclist should be in the middle of the road, not riding up the gutter'.

So how do you deal with motorists like her? Would the lady in this article be free from the possibility of a motorist pulling out infront of her again if there was 50% less traffic?

**Coutinho** - Good signing for the price. Needs more consistency. Can become great.

**Moreno** - Looking good. Needs better concentration but is young and that should come.

**Aly Cissokho** - Miss. Thankfully only a loan.

**Origi** - Looks very good for Belgium. Has a very high potential and could be world class eventually.

**Balotelli** - Miss so far but still early days and could absolutely turn it around. I have seen enough from him previously to believe that.

**Lallana** - Has been decent. Needs a more regular spot to justify the price.

**Borini** - Miss for us but looked good for Sunderland. Still wish we'd got the £14m for him last summer, as I don't think he is Liverpool-quality.

**Aspas** - Complete and utter miss. Awful signing.

**Assaidi** - See Aspas.

**Sahin** - Maybe the most disappointing for me. Was really excited when we got him, but didn't work out. Not sure who's fault that was.

**Sturridge** - Excellent signing! Shame about his injuries though.

**Moses** - Awful. Thankfully only a loan.

**Manquillo** - Looking good! Hope we manage to keep hold of him. One of the bright points so far his season.

**Emre Can** - Looks decent and I always forget that he's only 20. Think he can become great.

**Markovic** - Disappointing performances so far. Big price tag to justify, but hopeful that he can do it once he settles in and gains confidence.

**Toure** - Fine signing in my opinion. Got him for free and he has great leadership and experience. Made a few costly mistakes though but so have all of our defenders.

**Allen** - I like Allen. Still think he was a decent signing.

**Sakho** - Sakho is confusing. Looks great for France but sometimes very clumsy with us. Hope he can reach is real levels with us too, because then he can be great.

**Lovren** - Major disappointment so far, with a huge price tag. Hopeful that he can turn it around though, as our defence as a whole has been bad. Looked very good when I saw him for Southampton and Croatia.

**Lambert** - Cheap and think he can improve and do a decent job for us. 

**Yesil** - Won't make it here.

You have if it costs £3m to get all the new equipment purchased and installed and the building up to code.

The type of tools and equipment used in steelwork isn't cheap, a chunk of it may not be intended to ever be moved and given how long they have been there a fair share of the major pieces of equipment may have been customized or built to need.  So they would need to pay for all new equipment to be brought in and built out and bring the new property up to code so that it could support steelwork etc.....not cheap. Plus if you are selling property in London (regardless of where in London)...you want to turn a bit of profit.

Personally i think this has gone well past a ""small time company getting screwed over"" and is just someone making every move they can to maximize their profit from the land sale (fair play, it is their land after all), but in the end it is just 2 parties being stubborn at this point that is delaying all of it.

Forster, as good as he is, is still young and is going to make mistakes.
We need to stop obsessing over Mane, yes hes good and fast and has got a few goals recently but he has changed our style of play, he has forced Tadic out to the right which i think has caused a noticeable drop in his performance. If you look at the way we were playing before Mane became a regular in the starting XI i feel there was alot more control rather than simpy playing a long ball forward and hoping he gets on the end of it. 
Pelle has got the Lambert curse from our first season back in the prem (He's done too well too quickly and has 2 men marking him most games) 
We DID miss Davis last night, he links up our wing backs with the attacking play and you could see both clyne and betrand were not being allowed into the game as much. 
Lastly i felt as though Long was superfluous in that game, he stated in the center (out of position) then sort of swapped with Tadic. Call me crazy but i think we should have taken a risk and played Long up front instead of Pelle (given him a much needed break)  and then had either cork or schneiderlin where Davis usually plays and then had a variation of the remaining two in CDM. Villa were desperate for a goal, shame to see such basic counter attacking footie get the better of us.

But the main most important part of this game was that we still got the point. I know we could have won but at 77 mins it was 1-0 and the majority of saints squads ive watched in my life would have ended the game with a loss but not this season, yes we wernt perfect but how amazing is it that even when we dont play perfect we can still get results to go our way. I really think last night was half us not playing 100% and half Villa defending and marking extremely well!!

So if you ended up in an English court based on your actions in England that somehow related to the site, California law could apply - even if it was different to English law.

And this is pretty common - mainly in commercial contract situations, but also in others; English courts can and will apply other kinds of law (although it is rare partly due to the expense of hiring lawyers qualified in the foreign law, expert witnesses and so on).

Stevie's role at DM last season wasn't protecting the back four, that was the two runners either side of him. He was the outlet. We were put under massive pressure, predominantly dealt with by the CB's and Henderson, and then they win the ball, get to Stevie and he launches the counter attack. As a defensive DM he was poor last year too, just his creativity worked. And when we *were* exposed (usually 3/4 times a game), we'd conceded 2/3 goals, and just counteract it by scoring 6.

Can and Gerrard. I think this could work. A specimen of an athlete in Can who can provide the cover for Gerrard's lacking legs and poor defensive know-how, while still allowing Gerrard to take the ball out from the defenders and spray those passes he does so well (usually).

Borini. Happy with that if it's true. We need to start shifting around our strikers because nothing is working up there. With the Can, Gerrard, Allen setup, Borini would be the perfect runner. Better work rate than Balotelli and fitter legs than Lambert.

Country borders are arbitrary. You could split China into it's regions and each would be larger and more populous than the UK and yet have a lower emissions than us. You could group us with the whole of the EU and we'd have a higher emissions total than the UK alone. The only valid and ""fair"" comparison is to look at CO2 per capita. Or are you saying that we each are ""allowed"" to produce more CO2 just because our country is smaller?

Even on our tiny island, we manage to produce 1.5% of the *entire world's* CO2. Just our paltry population produces that much. And it makes ""no difference""? Are you kidding me?

So what, are you saying that any country that produces under 2% total doesn't need to care about emissions? Is that the rule now? So if we split China into 12 regions, each contributing only 2% of the world's emissions. Now they don't need to curb emissions? So Qatar, a country that produces a whopping 40 t/capita gets a free pass? We're small so we get to be selfish. They're big so they can't?

Let's get one thing straight. No one is suggesting that China doesn't need to reduce emissions. Of course they do! But sitting here expecting them to deliberately harm their economy to save the environment while we continue to reap the benefits at any cost to the environment is just hypocritical and ridiculous.

That said, we are not the main perpetrators of this. The UK and the EU are actually doing a fair bit to curb emissions.

No one comes out of Bristol's transport problems happy. Cyclists are dicks because they constantly jump lights and cycle on pavements whenever it pleases them. Motorists are dicks because they take no one other than themselves into account. First are dicks because the bus system is terrible, and more often than not bus drivers are pricks. The council are dicks because they've done nothing to sort out Bristol's roads despite years of unhappiness all-round. Fergie is a dick because he jams his agenda down our throats, ultimately leaving only himself happy with the outcome.

That being said, I completely agree with this article. Cyclists have every right to use the road, whether they are courteous cyclists or light-jumping bellends, and currently conditions for everyone are poor. I'd love to cycle in, but I don't trust other motorists, and I certainly don't trust other cyclists. I've been knocked off a few times before, and one of those times was by another cyclist.

I think this problem can't be solved by Bristol alone. It needs to be raised at national level.

&gt;I feel we could break Chelseas unbeaten record

What on earth has recently shown that we are capable of that? They are the best team in the league by a mile, and we are currently playing like a mid table side amongst a whole host of what seems to be locker room issues. 

Let's put things into perspective, our last 4 premier league games:

- Won 1-2 against relegation candidate Hull, after a shoddy first half performance and only coming alive after a sending off
- Lost 1-2 at home vs Stoke, putting in an abysmal performance lacking any guts or fight
- Won 1-2 against relegation candidate Villa, after a shoddy performance and only coming alive after a sending off (sound familiar?) with a deflected free kick saving us 
- Lost 1-2 at home vs Newcastle, another poor performance lacking even any fight 
- The only team we have truly dominated and put in a 90 minute performance against was bottom of the league QPR who played 3 CB's.

&gt;I believe we could finish in the top four, our results against the big teams weren't to bad compared to last year.

Mate, losing 4-1 against City and 0-3 to Liverpool is not an improvement because we conceded slightly less goals. 

Look I love the team, I want nothing more than us to win and I will give them my utmost support regardless, which is a lot more than can be said for current majority that are attending the lane but we need to be realistic here.

No I don't think 1.5% of something is a lot.  If you say it is, then you're kidding me.  

&gt;You compare the total emissions of a country with 20 times our population and 40 times our land mass to us and say I'm manipulating the data? How in the hell is that a valid comparison?

It's valid because at the end of the day per capita make no difference.  The total amount of greenhouse emissions needs to be reduced, *regardless of the population size of any given area*.  It doesn't matter if one person is producing all the gases in the world, or if billions are; the greenhouse effect is the same. 

&gt;So what, are you saying that any country that produces under 2% total doesn't need to care about emissions? Is that the rule now?

This is just moronic; of course it's not a rule; but it's blindingly obvious that if the largest producers of emissions don't cut their shit out, the end result is the same, regardless of what we as a producer of 1.5% of emissions do.  I can't believe you're even suggesting a different position to be honest. 

&gt;That still doesn't give us free pass though.

They would have to be responsible for gathering names / details during the initial connection; the infrastructure is already there (think The Cloud login page) they'll most likely just need a way to prove who you are at sign up (bank card?), for their sake.

Bit of a mammoth task but I can see it happening in one form or another unfortunately. It would of course have little effect on those who mask their original IP with foreign VPNs and the like, but if the government are legit when they say its to ""protect the children"" and ""stop terrorism online"" then I can see it at least having some effect.

false,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"Here is the full transcript of one of the questions that Gerry Adams was asked at last night's Sinn Fein meeting in Enniskillen followed by his response.

Question from a member of the audience:

“When we talk about young people being turned off I think there is a lot of the older generation, people that voted all their lives... by what's happening up at Stormont... they're just shaking their heads and I think they are dragging us down. I don't think it's Sinn Fein's fault – we are trying our hardest. I didn't think it was possible but the DUP seem to be going backways and more bigotry, you know. Is there a line in the sand that we say, look it, there's no point even trying with these ones because they are dragging the whole thing down.”

[The] problem with the free state government is they don't want to know now either because they're probably delighted to see it fails so they can turn around and say that Sinn Fein couldn’t administrate the Assembly and the six counties.”

Question to the audience member from the chair of the meeting.

“What do you think yourself?”

The audience member responds: “I don't know, I am just wondering what the leadership's spiel on it is – where the DUP are at the minute or what they are playing at?”

The full response from Gerry Adams:

“OK, well, first of all I neglected to do it in my opening remarks – it's just to thank people because, you know, people come out and make your own stand in your own way within your own community within your own families. I think it's very important that the appreciate that and you know from my point of view the whole thrust is what we are trying to do has to be about empowering people. So I have learnt things from this meeting tonight and I do these meetings all the time. But it was just very interesting to come in here and to hear the range of views on a range of subjects – good, radical, progressive thinking about, for example, issues of rural community.

A lot of our traditions come from rural Ireland and the need to develop those and to assist, to encourage people to take control. You know, what Vic was describing about, you know, small towns dying off, villages dying off, the scourge of emigration, I know it's an issue I've campaigned on for a long time. We need to be making a stand on these issues and developing ways and means for people to take more and more control over their own lives.

I remember one time doing a meeting in Belfast and people were really, really annoyed about David Trimble. I remember saying, at the meeting, 'Why are yous so annoyed about David Trimble? Yous don't have to work with him'. So, it is a matter of being patient but not being too patient, you know, trying to push, push ahead.

And you can rest assured that somewhere in that notion of why increasingly unionists aren't voting is that they are scundered by the likes of Gregory Campbell, they are scundered by the things that are going on. They are not going vote for us and so on at this stage, in our development or their development but, I mean, yous all live here – how many unionists do you talk to? We're trying to convert people and in there somewhere the sort of fundamentalist bigotry, because that's what it is – it's nothing got to do with politics. It's got to do with blind bigoted hatred of people and not just Catholics, of Presbyterians, of Church of Ireland, of meth... of everybody, bar the people who share their own very narrow vision of the world.

Now, that's not unique in Ireland. It manifests itself in other societies but in other societies it's illegal and in other societies life goes on and people can be racist, people can be homophobic, people can be anti-Semitic but they are not allowed to do it in a very public way. So, we don't have that expression yet. Sectarianism remains one of the big issues that we have to deal with as a people.

There are lots of thoughts in terms of the indications that were thrown up. One of the things that was very prevalent was the point that Kevin made. For a period there, I spend most of my working week in Dublin but when I was back in Belfast or at meetings like this it was universal people saying ‘what’s the point?’, ‘what’s the point?’. They weren't blaming Sinn Fein — in fact they were making the point that Sinn Fein were doing their best.

**But what’s the point? The point is to actually break these bastards - that’s the point. And what’s going to break them is equality. That’s what’s going to break them - equality. Who could be afraid of equality? Who could be afraid of treating somebody the way you want to be treated. That’s what we need to keep the focus on - that’s the trojan horse of the entire republican strategy – is to reach out to people on the basis of equality.**

The question about where is the tipping point... You see, the interesting thing about Gorbachev... Gorbachev didn't set out to get rid of the USSR – that wasn't his intention. He wanted to modernise it. It needed to be reformed but once he started to pull the thread it wasn't possible. The afrikaners didn't want to bring about an ANC government in South Africa. They wanted to get rid of the international campaign that was hurting them in terms of their different money making ventures. They actually, and I had the privilege of going there after Mandela was released and I talked to the guy – I forget his name but it is well enough written about -went into the prison to talk to Mandella and he told me, because he was one of the people who went and argued for them to start defusing some of the worst aspects of apartheid rule. They thought Mandela was going to home, they thought that blacks couldn't govern themselves – he told me that.”",0,1416925308,null,0,false,0,cmckv37,t3_2ndfon,t1_cmckv37,t3_2ndfon,null,1425849152,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5

At a guess I reckon you'd be looking at $1-2 per cigar all in. Not exactly espensive!

EDIT: Looks like my guess is on the money:

&gt;Approximately how many cigars can I roll out of a pound of tobacco? 
Although this is one of the most common questions we receive, it is also one of the hardest to answer. It really depends on the size of the cigars you roll, your cigar rolling technique, and personal preferences. It can also be confusing because different leaves can be used for different parts of the cigar. You might have one type of leaf for a filler, another leaf for a binder, and yet another tobacco leaf for a wrapper. If this was the case, you would ultimately have 3 pounds of tobacco leaf, not just one.

Essentially they are locked savings account (typically 12 months, can be longer) into which you deposit a lump sum.  The banks offer you a fixed interest rate.  The important point with ISA is that the interest you earn is TAX FREE.  Unlike normal savings accounts where the interest earned is taxed at 10% ( I believe).

You normally have to shop around for a new ISA every year, the reason being is that they will offer a great promotional rate of say 2.5% for year one but then drop to 0.5% after that.  So make sure to move your money to whoever is offering the most competitive ISA each year.  Normally the best offers appear towards the end of the tax year (March/April).

Lastly ISA's tend to offer higher interest rates than most savings accounts currently.  I think ISA's interest rates are around 2.5%, so just a little bit more than current inflation figures of 2.1%..

You can deposit up to £15,000 per annum into an ISA.  What many people tend to do is take their yearly savings  and dump them into their ISA come renewal time.

The Telegraph doesnt like HS2 so they have written in this ""HS2 dying"" slant but the original discussion they are talking about is not really about the business case of the railway at all.  

Basically, to accomodate extra HS2 tracks and passengers coming into Euston they need to massively rebuild it.  At Kings Cross St Pancras station upgrades could be balanced against profit from selling off spare railway land for development (the new Google HQ going here and so on).  At Euston it's the opposite, they will need to claim land.  

The obvious way to make it pay for itself is stick expensive flats/offices on top of the station.  However they can't build very tall stuff here because of sightline restrictions regarding St Pauls.  And they are committed to a certain percentage of affordable property by council policy etc.

This is the developers saying ""within these constraints we can't turn a profit on this - you'll have to let us build higher or build more/only super-rich flats, not affordable flats"".

So, a lot do with London property speculation, nothing much to do with the benefits or failings of HS2 per se.

Of course it does have massive impacts on HS2, as a line with no terminus is, well, problematic... But ultimately this is a piece about the cost/benefit of the Euston (over-)station development, not the cost/benefit of HS2 as a transport link.",0,1416925496,null,0,false,0,cmckxof,t3_2ncqqz,t1_cmckxof,t1_cmcjmz6,null,1425849119,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

And the Snow Hill - Marlybone route is definitely not at capacity either, plenty of space. But it goes unused due to a privatised rail network that needs to squeeze every penny out of their line. Why run two trains where everyone can get a seat, when you can run one and make half the people stand? You get to have less staff, less stock, and lower maintenance, and still get the same money in.

Conflict of laws is a fairly complicated and messy area of law, and it is rarely litigated or appealed (as often cases are settled through arbitration or mediation), but I've found a couple of examples of key cases.

* [This one](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1162.html) involved a contract that was subject to Japanese law, and the English High Court seems to have applied Japanese law in dismissing it. It went to appeal because one of the parties had sued the other, and they'd agreed that the claim would be done under English law (even though the contract was under Japanese law), but the other party issued a counter-claim under the original contract. The counter-claim would fail under Japanese law but succeed under English law (possibly), so the counter-claimant tried to argue that by agreeing that the main claim would be under English law, they agreed the same with the counter-claim. But the courts disagreed. It isn't the most readable judgment, though.

* [a second example](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1024.html) might be a bit clearer; here the trial court had found that a contract was governed by the law of Texas (see the first paragraph) and the appeal looks into whether Texas law, Iranian law or English law should apply, finally settling on English law.

While in theory neither of these appeals involves applying non-English law (they're just applying English law rules on which law should be applied), I think in both cases the trial court will have applied non-English law (Japanese and Texas law) to part of the case.",0,1416925677,null,0,false,0,cmcl08g,t3_2nd13e,t1_cmcl08g,t1_cmckdg3,null,1425849087,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

They didn't tase a fireman. They tased a guy. He was off-duty, out of uniform. His job did not factor into it. And you don't need to be armed for a taser to be an appropriate tool. Firemen tend to be well built with a lot of upper body strength. They don't need a weapon to put up a fight. If it's a choice between being tased or spending the next 8 weeks with my arm in plaster where it's been broken by a baton strike I'll take the taser.

I'm broadly confident that there has been Police misconduct in this case. They do seem to have gone OTT. However, I was drawn to this line:

&gt; He had driven through the cordon.

Hmmm.
Let's play devils advocate and jump into the Police boots here. It's a month after the riots (context is everything). You're a Police officer who has spent the last month on riot duty and mopping up the aftermath. Your colleagues have been attacked, ambushed and hospitalised. You're attending an incident where you're getting missiles thrown at you and then some guy comes and drives through the cordon?

Yeah, alarm bells for the Police.

*None of us* know exactly how it happened, but it's established that he crossed a cordon, and there was a disagreement before he was dragged out of the car. It's not hard to imagine it went something like this:

**Fire**: ""Guys, guys""

**Cop**: ""WTF? Who's crossed the cordon? MOVE THAT CAR!""

**Fire**: No, no, I've got something to tell you""

**Cop**: ""You're in the way of this incident. Move the car, right now""

**Fire**: ""No, no, come here""

**Cop**: ""Fuck this, arrest that joker. We haven't got time for this bollocks, they'll be back with more bricks to lob in a minute""

Clearly, the Police went totally OTT. Or did they? You've got a really big guy with significant upper body strength resisting arrest. Tasing him is better than beating him with a baton and breaking bones.

We need to remember the context that this is a month after the riots - during which there were incidents where officers were ambushed, beaten, some of them put in hospital with serious injuries.

Has it occurred to anyone that *at that moment in time* the prospect of being barraged by missiles was more somewhat more significant and worthy of attention to those officers than worrying about some kid who'd lobbed a stone at a van?

The fact this guy is an off-duty fireman is of no relevance - they didn't know that. He was a guy who had crossed a cordon and then refused to comply with instructions from Police.

He made a bad decision by assuming because he was an Fireman he could cross a cordon. Should have stopped at the cordon, motioned them over with his Fire ID held out to instantly establish his credibility. They'd have probably been a bit more willing to hear him out once they realised he wasn't trying to cause trouble for them.

That doesn't mean I put the blame on him - he was just trying to be a good citizen and colleague, and clearly the Police have not upheld the standards we would expect of them. But without more information, I'm not entirely sure I disagree with the arrest. The manner of the arrest *perhaps*, any abusive or unprofessional language used *absolutely*, and if they were being racist c*nts, then sack them off. But they were dealing with an ongoing incident and if he was in their way, then yeah, he needed to fuck off.

Firstly, GCHQ's responsibility is not to find pedophiles.  GCHQ's responsibility is foreign and domestic spying and surveillance, against foreign and domestic powers that threaten the crown and HM Government.  

The problem is that blanket surveillance leads to a unconstrained collection of information, which is then passed around by back channels as part of the black-market currency of political favours.  Need some dirt on someone?  Oh, that's easy, your mate knows a guy who knows a guy.  Suddenly a reformist political candidate withdraws from a race, leaving the status quo in charge, because she's being blackmailed over what she and her husband do behind closed doors in their own home.

&gt; Between counter-terrorism and paedophiles and everything in between I'm willing to sacrifice everything I post on the internet for these things.

So you are prepared to never be able to have an original thought or object to the status quo so long as you are kept safe?  Amazing.  I don't actually know what to make of someone like you, but I can tell you one thing, the politicians will love you as a voter.

&gt; And even so, it isn't going to change, so bitching about it is just more likely for them to pay attention to you.

If enough people make enough noise and educate enough people, it will make it uneconomical for the government to do it as a large-scale, industrialised process.  

&gt; You're just an idiot if you can't see the benefits to surveillance from a citizens point of view.

Ask anyone who grew up in East Germany what it was like to live under the Stasi.  Then go and read some of the files they held on people and ask yourself if you would be comfortable with some random stranger knowing your reading habits, your sexual preferences, and your route to and from work.  It is a short step from 'these people are terrorists' to 'these people are undesirable to the government' to 'these people are undesirable to the government because they disagree with us'.

There is no benefit to global surveilance.  The signal to noise ratio is miniscule, and there is almost no way to collate the data collected in a meaningful way.  All global surveillance does is grant the illusion of safety and permit the gradual erosion of civil rights in the name of 'safety.'  

Your world view is fascinating, and I wish you luck when you find yourself living in it, because that is where we are unfortunately headed.  I doubt you will find the world any safer when the government knows and owns your every move, but you may think wistfully of the day when you could read a book like 1984 without earning a visit from the men from the Ministry of Education and Culture.

Mentioning the Anglo-Spanish War as more than just a war of religion is a pleasant surprise! In general, I think the documentary is pretty accurate, even if the introduction describing Britain as having ""merely"" 60m inhabitants is a little sinocentric, as it is the third-most populous island in the world. It has a population density that is probably greater than any of the Chinese provinces.

The description of the battle of Gravelines is a little innacurate. The word ""decimate"" is used, which refers to a Roman punishment of the execution of one-tenth of a number, and is not a ""proper"" word used by historians. 

The references to ""strong leaders"" and the sayings of Karl Marx are somewhat disingenuous, especially since the role of the privateer has already been described in detail. The British Empire came about as the result of private enterprise, rather than through a strong monarchy. In fact, the English crown is one of the oldest constitutional monarchies in existence, with parliament preventing the monarch from ruling with absolute power.

Some of the mistakes are very glaring, since the video proceeds to contradict itself by explaining the accurate account. It comes across as if it's a stereotypical ""government censor"" in order to at least pay lip service to the idea of an unchallenged autocracy as a necessary part of a modern state, when really, Britain's modernisation did not contain that, a fact which the producers attempt to hint towards.

Favourite experience as a fan is a tough one, I tend to remember the heartache over the joy a lot- but there have been a few defining ones:

Unsworth scoring in the first minute on Moysies debut, when we were in desperate need of momentum and points to avoid relegation

http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1873803.stm

Big Dunc scoring against Man Utd was a glorious one in the game where Neville and Scholes got sent off. This was extra special because it was the game when a lot of us really started thinking that Top 4 was a realistic opportunity.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4451321.stm

---

I think over all of them though, was Kevin Campbell's entire catalogue of heroics at the end of the 98-99 season. We were relegation bound, couldn't score for shit, couldn't defend for shit and had no confidence... Our answer; a desperation loan signing of an ex-Arsenal academy prospect who was earning his living in Turkey. This ended up being a profoundly brilliant move, and Kevin Campbell scored 9 in the last 8 games of the season, single handedly keeping us up and securing his legacy as (IMO) the single most important player in our history.

We then went to sign him on a permanent deal, he fell in love with the club and the fans, calling Everton his Spiritual Home.. Well, he is welcome any day. Funnily enough, after leaving us, he moved to WBA and saved them from the drop also.

This was my problem. When I heard Sanchez off for Bent my immediate reaction wasn't ""Why is he replacing Sanchez with an attacker?"" It was ""Bent? Why the fuck?"" ... It made no sense. He wasn't going to score on the break for us, and he can't hold it up and wait for support. So why put him there?

Retrospectively, asking a tiring Gabby to cover a marauding fullback was a silly idea too. It's not like Clyne hadn't been pushing forward all game.

Deciders in race are historical, cultural, linguistic, religious, anatomical, ethnic, geographical and social.

Historically, the people of Ireland are Celts. Culturally, we have shit tons of distinct myths, musical instruments, songs, poems etc etc. Linguistic, we have the many forms of Gaelic - Irish, Manx, Scottish Gaelic, Middle Irish, Old Irish, Goidelic, Proto-Celtic, Welsh, Cornish, Breton. Religious, old Irish were 'pagan', believing in hundreds of Gods and Goddesses, even spreading that belief to Britain and beyond at one point - until largely converting to Christianity and generally Catholicism, whereas Britain converted to Protestantism. Anatomically, there is little to no difference (and this is why most people deny that the Celtic race is distinct from those of the people of Britain). Ethnically, the Celts come from Ireland originally. The British are Anglo-Saxon, coming from Germanic tribes including Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Geographically, the Celts had all of Ireland, Great Britain (until the Anglo-Saxons), parts of Spain, France, even Turkey.

false,codeduck,southafrica,Saffer at large,"&gt;You come up with hyperbole like 'There is no benefit to global surveilance' and have no sources, in fact no idea, about how it actually works, and what the country would be like without it. 

Here's a simplification.

1.  Large-scale logging of all plaintext at major internet exchanges, both internal and external.  Data is logged into natural text indexed datastores based on technologies like elastisearch or hadoop, and intelligent people spend a lot of time writing programs which attempt to generate concordances and cross-references that use bayesian methods and other statistical tools to attempt to categorise chunks of data as high / medium / low interest.

2. Geolocation data from wireless devices is captured via specialist hardware or custom data feeds from cellphone towers or wifi hotspots.  Cellular phones leak IMEI and other identifying data, which is then again categorised by programs written by intelligent people into high / medium / low interest.  A cellphone which spends a lot of time in a radical east-London Madrasssa or Mosque, or a phone which is often in the area around various high-sensitivity military sites, would go into this list.

3. A data collation program attempts to joins data from 1. and 2. above into a profile.  So someone who spends time near military bases might be an innocent bird-watcher, but if that same person is frequenting websites known to be used by fundamentalists, then that's a set of flags that would make him a target.  Lets call this guy person A.

This ignores a couple of fundamental issues.

1.  Person A's internet might have been hijacked by a trojan or similar malware.
2.  Person A's phone may have been stolen or sold on the second hand market.
3.  Person A may be a tolerant imam who's trying to deradicalise youngsters at the madrassa.  He might be a bird-watcher in his spare time, and the militarily sensitive area may be rich in natural wildlife.

Due to the nature of the data collection, GCHQ is spammed to death by a mountain of false positives, so much so that they have too much data to actually do anything with.

Meanwhile, person B is intelligent enough to use PGP and various other techniques to mask his identity, and slips underneath the radar, because he (the person that GCHQ actually wants to catch) is not detectable via blanket surveilance.  Especially if he's intelligent enough to craft and maintain an entirely believable false online presence.

&gt; You in fact have no what the country would be like without it.
Pretty much exactly the same as it is now, except I wouldn't have to worry about someone asking about my obsession with /r/catgifs when I want to get a mortgage.

&gt; Your unsubstantiated opinions are entertaining but unfortunately completely overstated.
And yours are merely sad.

I know the difficulties of aggregating and collating free-form data in a meaningful way.

&gt;Proposed direct subsidy limits (2007)

&gt; In the autumn of 2007 the European Commission was reported to be considering a proposal to limit subsidies to individual landowners and factory farms to around £300,000. Some factory farms and large estates would be affected in the UK, as there are over 20 farms/estates receiving £500,000 or more from the EU.[17][18] Similar attempts have been unsuccessful in the past and were **opposed in the UK by two strong lobbying organisations the Country Land and Business Association and the National Farmers Union.** Germany, which has large collective farms still in operation in what was East Germany, also vigorously opposed changes that were marketed as ""reforms"". The proposal was reportedly submitted for consultation with EU member states on 20 November 2007.[19]

Bear in mind the CAP was brought in to protect smaller farmers who tended to be one bad year from financial collapse in a post-war period where food security was imperative.

These days it has been inflated to reward wealthy people for being wealthy and in no way bears a link to the risk of farming or the diminished need for food security (since we have a strong food surplus across Europe now let alone the unprecedented ability to import from abroad as well). We produce so much food now we have to throw it away. (as to avoid distorting the market price for food there are quotas that only so much can be sold into the market, the rest must be disposed of)

I think the bit about Newton is a bit controversial, they breifley mentioned Robert Hooke, a contemporary scholar. Hooke has been attributed to being a great scientific mind of the time - but he made one terrible mistake, he died before Newton. His contributions were downplayed posthumously.

The ""fall of the empire"" section was laughably simplistic. There was a miriad of social, political and economic pressures on the empire; both internally from nationalism and externally from foreign imperialism.

Imperialism hasn't ended either. They just gave the African colonies their own plastic government in the image of western law and use the pretext of free market capitalism to continue to extort wealth from these countries. Anyone who opposes it (Thomas Santara, Muammar Ghadaffi) is called a dictator that brutally oppresses his own people and is justifiably killed, meanwhile the same imperialists support other dictators who really do brutally oppress their own people (Pinochet, Batista, Garcia). The spices must flow.

I also find it odd that there was no mention of the two wars that dragged most of the globe into a territorial dispute that costs millions of lives that affected China indirectly as it lead to the October revolution that provided and alternative form of governance. And affected China directly as a victim of Japanese agression.

Players such as Xabi, Mascherano, Torres, and Suarez were already pretty much top players, or just on the precipice of becoming them when we bought them.  We took them to the next level of course.  I think these are the kinds of players we can get, and do very well with.  It's a little more risky because the player still have to take the next step, but we're a good club for them to do that with.  Unfortunately that also means we'll likely only have them for like 2-3 seasons before they make their big money move, but if we're doing it right then we're making a profit on them as well as a massive benefit on the pitch during their time here.  We need to not design the entire system around them like we did with Suarez though, otherwise the wheels come right off when the player leaves, just like we're experiencing now.

Players I'd considering to be along these lines, that I think we can get for 10-30mil (depending on position and current ability+current club and contract situation of course) who will likely succeed here are ones like Lacazette, Volland, Kramer, Schaar, etc.

So yes, I don't think we can get players who have already exploded onto the scene per say, like Reus or Sanchez.  But I do think we can make a real good go at grabbing the ones who are probably about to break out, and then reap the benefits of that.

Approximately 70 crew members are needed to operate the yacht and serve the guests.

* Estimated value of $500m USD

*  Eclipse is said to have an anti paparazzi system, a laser which is used to detect the electronic light sensors that digital cameras use. The camera is then targeted with a beam of bright light that overexposes the photo, which becomes useless.

&gt; His comments to the House of Commons came after the parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC) concluded that the brutal murder of Rigby could have been prevented if an internet company had passed on an online exchange in which one of the killers expressed “in the most graphic terms” his intention to carry out an Islamist jihadi attack.

&gt; The 191-page report by the ISC says that if MI5 had had access to the exchange between one of the killers, Adebowale, and an extremist overseas, Adebowale would have become a top surveillance priority. By failing to alert the authorities, the company had, “however unintentionally”, provided a “safe haven for terrorists”.

I don't understand how anyone can expect ISPs to magically filter, analyse and share information like this. Let's disregard the complexity of storing and interpreting things for now. Let's even forget the possibility of someone clued up and using tor to protect their exchanges.

Consider that most ""online exchanges"" take place over connections with end-to-end encryption - facebook, myspace, twitter, google, hotmail, reddit and on and on.

All the major sites now have HTTPS as the default, some force it exclusively. Whilst once upon a time it was only really banks that cared about secure connections, there's now a push by an increasing number of people online to encourage implementation of end-to-end encryption for everything.

There are very few sites that users access nowadays that don't encrypt connections. Even small sites with limited users can very easily set up HTTPS.

It's simply not feasible for the ISPs to do a blanket search for suspicious communications.

I don't disagree with your assessment though, I do think we're an attractive destination for the 2nd tier, if you will, we just need to be cognizant of the fact that we're likely an interim port in their voyage unless/until we start paying a lot more than we do now and/or have a prolonged spell closer to the top of the table than the middle of it.  When clubs like United can afford to pay the someone like Rojo £200k a week, things are going to be tough.  Basically we need to identify and get those 2nd tier players who will become 1st tier, which to be fair is a lot easier said than done.  

Edit:  This is part of why I'm not a huge fan of buying the likes of Markovic.  He cost £20M on a 5 year contract, meaning when he's in his last year he'll be 24.  Assuming he progresses to that Tier 1 status (big assumption and I figure the odds are maybe &lt; 20% or so) it probably won't be for several seasons that we see him have an impact.  Meaning he probably won't be here for long when he hits his peak.  I'd be looking more at the 22-24 year old tier 2 players (like the ones you mentioned) who are closer to that peak now and kids in U-18s who aren't going to cost nearly as much.

Markovic is one that should come really good, but I think we jumped at him a little too early.  You're exactly right that we're going to have to wait for quite some time before we really get to benefit from him on the pitch, and unfortunately we're not really in a position to wait a long time right now.

Can I think is a bit mature for his age, both in ability and mentality.  He's looked good for us so far and is fitting in nicely all things considered.  Maybe he's a year or two away from the level we really want, but it's not too harmful because we can still get good benefit from him now as well.  Can and Moreno are the only 2 really astute signings we made this window in my opinion, the others were either grossly overpriced, too young to influence things yet, or some combination of both (and then there's Balotelli, who my head says was a total waste and my heart prays will come good for us soon... I just like the guy and the enormous ability he clearly has but doesn't use is just infuriating so I like to hope we can be the ones to finally solve the puzzle).

I actually think Ilori can come really good for us.  He's done really well on loan last season and so far in this one.  He's a smart defender with good feet and amazing pace for his position, he fits the, mould we want really well.  He's a good example of a player we jumped on 2-3 seasons too soon though, so now we're just paying for him but he's doing nothing for us.

Morning:

* Wash face with water
* Moisturise with Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream
* Sunblock [Clinique Super City Block SPF 40](http://www.boots.com/en/Clinique-Super-City-Block-SPF-40-40ml_18544/)

Evening:

* Wash face with Superdrug Vitamin E Hot Cloth Cleanser (been using this for a week after seeing the reviews, my skin loves it!)
* AHA Olay Regenerist Night Renewal Elixir every other day
* BHA [red Stridex in the box](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000NUN8BK/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416933701&amp;sr=1&amp;keywords=stridex) every other *other* day (seems a bit strong for my skin, don't use it often)
* Spot treatment Freederm Fast Track Spot Gel
* Moisturise with Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream

I'm looking for a new sunblock to buy when this one finishes (as it's a bit too pricey for me), can't have fatty alcohols in it (I *think* they break me out). Hopefully without a white masque effect and no alcohol (really dries me out).

I'm also looking for a suggestions on an antioxidant or vitamin C serum, I'm only 19 but I'd like to prevent everything possible! I don't know if niacinamide breaks me out but I have been reading the topics on here about it. I'm very open to products from Asia as well! :D

To expand: I think Long's hold up play was actually pretty good that game, but Davis's role is basically stay slightly further forward than Morgan and Big Vic, come back to receive the ball, and then either give it back to the DMs or up to Tadic, Pelle, or Mane. As much as I like Long, his instinct is not to receive the ball from the midfielders, which is why I think we had so many long balls last game.

This applies to every economy ever, the argument for a carbon tax isn't an economic one, it's an environmental one. Of course a carbon tax will cost something.

If China thinks climate science is crap, nothing will happen. Thankfully that isn't the case.

&gt; And even if China did introduce its own carbon tax, production would just shift again to somewhere cheaper, and less regulated. 

And keep pushing the environmental cause until we we cover the world. After covering a critical mass, a tariff on imports from nontaxed sources should do the rest.

Like I said, these aren't cheap solutions, they will hurt the economy, they will cost jobs. But climate change action is needed, otherwise worse would come.


&gt; You don't solve anything by putting a tax on production, you just make it harder for UK companies to do business. The UKs manufacturing regulations mean it would be much more environmentally friendly to manufacture something here than in China, 

Manufacturing in the UK has not competed on price for a long time already. Even if you do get outsourcing, it wont increase emissions more than the decreases within the UK.

And the majority of emissions come from transportation, land use and electricity generation, those can't be outsourced.

I know there are flaws in a carbon tax, but there is no other way to transition into a carbon free economy.

&gt; I bet you wanted Rafa out when we finished 7th in 09/10

Disappointed? Massively. Out? Never. Never foolish enough to want away a CL winning manager, but I understand you dont prefer the CL. Carry on deluding yourself.

&gt; They're not there anymore because they've sold their top players.

You dont say! And why were they sold, I'm sure a CL winning side needs to be completely dismantled in a couple years.. 
So since Rafa left, why hasnt Inters fortune turned, as per your logic since he was holding them back. 

&gt; I'm not foolish enough to think that he drained Inter though

But you are naive enough to fall for Joses venomous words against Rafa and believe every word he says. The world realized that Jose had finished Inter and had them playing for 'Jose' and not 'Inter'.
You are naive enough to not understand what Rafa meant to this club and the things he did for us. 

Anyway, carry on marching behind your philosopher.

Whilst you are there you might ask if they will prescribe you Nicam 4% niacinamide gel instead of the Freederm (60g pack size compared to 10g or 25g). You could then use that on a wider area as a prevention rather than spot treatment if you wished. With regular use niacinamide can increase the skin's ceramide synthesis, so helping moisturise.

Antioxidant/ vitamin C serum .... various options. [SR Skincare] (http://www.sr-skincare.co.uk/30ml-10-vitamin-c-serum-25-p.asp) do a 10% CE ferulic which is very reasonably priced. Active Formulas have the [Let's Make Collagen] (http://www.activeformulas.com/products/collagen-serum-new-version) and [Antioxidant CHAS] (http://www.activeformulas.com/products/anti-oxidant-serum-chas)  serums. Both have magnesium ascorbyl phosphate form of C which is backed by research, see our Wiki.

- [Manuka + Vitamin A Clarifying Facial Oil]
(http://www.greenkeratin.co.uk/manuka--vitamin-a-clarifying-facial-oil---acne-prone-skin-types-640-p.asp)

These are a little more expensive but you really don't need to use a lot, I use two pumps each night for face, neck and decollete and that is overdoing it. IIIRC none should be comedogenic, they are based on oils rich in linoleic acid which is beneficial in acne, or jojoba or both.

The colour of the rosehip and Q10 oils strongly indicates to me they are using a worthwhile percentage of antioxidants, and bear in mind there is no water so these products are 100% ingredients. The rosehip is super gentle even on skin irritated by microneedling, the Q10 + E is more intense but is fine on my sensitive skin IF it's not already inflamed.

Cycling isn't really that dangerous, especially compared to cars. Pedestrians are far more likely to be injured by a car than a cyclist, and then you can factor in the other negative impacts like air pollution, noise pollution and the space that cars take up in our cities. If we want the roads to be safe we want to encourage the shift from the dangerous forms of transport and to the safer forms of transport. I think your proposal would have the opposite effect and make roads more dangerous.

Also insurance and registration wouldn't raise money for infrastructure, but just pay for themselves. I'd suggest that we should fund better cycling and walking infrastructure out of tax as it would benefit us all. Create a virtuous circle where we build the infrastructure and encourage its use, rather than making cycling less attractive through regulation. Making roads safer and improving air quality benefits us all. Drivers benefit from getting cars off the road as much as everyone else (congestion/parking etc).

Edit: found this [here:](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-5474b71fe4b08fbd11e1ad84)

&gt;The report does not name which US tech service Adebowale used, but at various points the 191-page report mentions Apple, BlackBerry, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo when giving examples of monitoring procedures.

&gt;The Guardian undestands the company in question is Facebook.

&gt;The report details 11 accounts run by Adebowale, with seven of those disabled by the company concerned and one closed by Adebowale himself.

&gt;The ISC’s report says that the technology company closed the accounts in an automated manner for violation of the company’s terms of service. Two accounts were closed for non-terrorism related activities, but the other five were disabled for terrorism-associated reasons, including one for being part of terrorist groups.

&gt;While no technology company would comment on the report to the Guardian, it is known that the posts were made in a private manner that was not indexed by a search engine, that the accounts could be members of groups, and that the company has automated systems for detecting and closing accounts for breach of terms of service.

Not to say Chelsea is always right by any stretch, but it does throw up some red flags for me.

In general, as I posted on another thread, I would probably avoid the 20-22 year old crowd unless they were judged to have enough capability to be in the first team regularly straight off.  Reason being their contracts will almost always be near up if/when they start to show promise (e.g. Ilori, Alberto, Coates, Borini, Markovic).  We either need them when they're really cheap at 16-18 or when they're more proven at 22-24 but not quite worldies yet.

false,lushdogg,null,null,"Hi guys I have a blog about home rolling here: 
http://personalblends.tumblr.com/

Here are a few pointers:
1.  Don't worry about press or mold you can can do fine without it

2.  Don't worry about commercial appearance or bands.  Set expectations on rolling something that smokes ok and tastes ok.

3.  First few rolls will be awful and most likely won't smoke. Don't worry about it.

4.  Capping is really tough and can get messy.  Double cap is fine and don't play around too much as you can end up doing more harm than good.


Here is a cheat sheet on basic rolling:

1.  1 Ligero, 2 Viso and 4 Seco

2.  Cut each leaf in 4 sections thereby removing stem, top point and bottom two thin frog legs

3.  Cut wrapper and binder in half removing stem and trimming outside of leaf

4.  Roll each piece of sectioned filler into tube and place in palm of hand, ligero in middle and building a ring/circle of filler tubes

4.  Bind - if using right side of leaf - flip wrapper so lighter side facing you and roll right to left, foot first, only glue outside of last 20% of binder, pinch head as you get close to finishing so you end up with curly head

5.  Wrapper (same as binding) - you end up with a curly head over binder curly head

6.  Cut piece of wrapper in shape or right-angled triangle, apply thin glue to lighter side, wrap around head of cigar, you will end up with the curly head being made up of binder, wrapper and this piece of triangle wrapper

7.  Cut curly head off right at base of curl and head

8.  Use something to cut a circle shape in wrapper, thinly glue the lighter side, apply cap by stretching from back to front, pinch extra bit and glue one side of jutting triangle and glue down

9.  (Optional) Cut smaller shape and do same as 8.

Preparing leaves:

0.   Put leaves in freezer for 2 days and then fridge for one day to kill tobacco beetle eggs

1.   Wrapper and binder may come wrinkled up.  Spray water and put in bag for a few minutes and then stretch out.

2.   Filler may need to be lightly misted to be able to roll into tube without cracking apart

Suggested purchase:

1.   1 pound of wrapper - CT Premium Shade is best but most expensive, 1 DW Maduro is thick and veiny (har har) but is less expensive, Ecuadorian Shade may be a good price/value combo but have yet to try it

2.   1 pound of binder - you could fish for binder quality in your filler but i dont recommend it.

3.   1 pound of ligero - this gives the punch to the filler blend and can also be used as binder for a cigar with more kick

4.   1 pound of viso - this gives a bit of flavor and controls burn, if your cigars are burning too fast, add more viso and reduce seco to slow burn without adding too much kick 

5.    2 pounds of seco - you will use alot of this as it is the base for your filler, add more if burning too slow, also alot of these leaves are so torn they need to be thrown away, also useful for padding out a cigar to try thicker ring gauges

6.  Cigar glue, i think it is just fruit pectin so buy your own or buy from leafonly.

7.  Chaveta or Ulu knife, normal knife just won't do it

8.  Cutting board or work table that you can slice and stain up

9.  Coolidor to store leaves


You should be able to roll about 50 or so small-ish robustos  with this amount.  Should be around $150 US.



Any other questions feel free to ask.

* Do make sure you have the proper space to pull in when needed. Just in case a vehicle rolls backwards or the vehicle behind lunges forward and you get squashed.
* Do have your lights on. All the time. General visibility is good, and that visibility is good when filtering as drivers will see a light moving against the other still lights/vehicles.
* Don't assume people will move. They usually won't
* Don't filter towards lights if it has those zig-zag lines.
* Do make a bit of noise by giving the throttle a few light twists
* Do assume that people will suddenly change lane at lights/junctions. They will.
* Don't go fast when filtering.
* Do watch out for gravel, drains, oil, fuel and debris at the edges of lanes etc.
* Don't filter in such a way that you'd force someone else to suddenly brake/change direction etc.

Police and MI5 had these two murderers pop up in MULTIPLE investigations but were assigned as low-risk/low priority. How hard would it have been to get a court order gaining access to THEIR specific messages and content online? Why does it suddenly mean we should all have our private communications run through a sieve for buzz words, which would lead to a million more false-positives to be of any use?

Everyday hundreds of millions of conversations happen across Facebook's chat platform. Quite how the Government expects Facebook to magically extract and flag the few terrorist messages and posts, I don't know.

Theoretically AI Classification could be used to flag potential messages but this would still only throw potential messages up. As there are still false positives and false negatives to take into account. These systems are nowhere near 100% accurate (in fact it's closer to 75-80%, depending on the task, although it is steadily getting better).

It would literally bury the human moderators under the load, worse even is if it was mandated that all of this must be passed onto Police and security services.

You swamp an already bursting-at-the-seams Security service with perfectly innocent conversations and potentially the odd real one would slip through.

Plus include the requirement that you'd need a MASSIVE cache of terrorist communications plus an equally large if not larger cache of innocuous messages for the actual training for classification.

Can you imagine the shitstorm that the media and idiot politicians would throw if it became public knowledge that Facebook et al were sharing a massive cache of terrorist content? You'd have all the papers frothing at the mouth.

Correct me if I'm wrong but XRP is not meant to have value.. it's just the water that supports transactions and faster and cheaper than traditional money transfers.. and yet market cap #2 seems a bit odd. The total number of XRP seems to change wildly and the market cap jumps a few weeks back from that - which is why it seems bogus; I know there's ~100 billion XRP but that's just a volume of water which has near zero value to anyone not using it. Why should anyone that isn't a 'gateway' buy XRP and why should we care what traction you have for GBP/XRP? How would anyone promote Ripple over Bitcoin; surely Ripple is not a currency, it's a utility like Western Union??.. is there more to it than that?

Obviously if you are able to provide a bridge from GBP to BTC, that will be really useful but the chatter about it's being Ripple, just causes confusion. Surely that it is Ripple, should not matter to anyone wanting BTC in exchange for GBP.. or would we need to care to use that.. would we need to have a Ripple account to get at the BTC?

What is a Ripple provider useful for??...

If you can answer any of those questions, I'll be interested in knowing more.

It means as a result you naturally sit deep in fear of making an error and instead of being pro-active/organised and trying to stop attacks before they actually happen you start to react to attacks as they occur which will pull defenders out of position and create more gaps and lead to more individual errors like we are seeing now.

I think Rodgers' system is a big issue but this is equally as much of a problem.

To combat this, we also only count the mum until baby is born, they would only be eligible for a 1 bedroom flat. They would then have to live here with almost no priority, even if boyfriend moved in. Additionally if assessed and mum is only young and doesn't appear ready to hold her own tenancy we have supported accommodation, on top of this it's also a requirement for someone in such a situation to have a housing support worker.

false,syntax,null,null,"Firstly, you should note that a Masters in the UK (and most of Europe) is usually a 1 year fully time or 2 year part time qualification - this is somewhat different from what it means in North America.

There's basically three types of Masters:

1. Conversion course (Got degree in X, need qualification in Y).
2. Advancement; generally leading to some level of profession practice (Got degree in X, become expert in X).
3. Continuing Professional Development (got experience in X; work with X, get better at X).

For some subject areas, there is overlap.  Software is one of those areas - it is not uncommon for a masters course to have people looking for each of the three scenarios above, at the same time.


Software, along with Business, is one of those areas where degrees before hand are less common - you'd probably be the only one without a degree at all, but it's not unheard of.

The biggest hurdle you'd have to meet is to convince the university admissions officer that you are knowledgeable to the required standard for starting the course.  They make take some convincing, depending on what evidence you can provide.    And once you start, you should expect to have to catch up with some topics that were assumed knowledge that you missed - there's no way round that I'm afraid.

For your direct questions:

1. It's unusual, but not unheard of.
2. Somewhat - but once you have a masters, start of by saying that, and then it's much less relevant.
3. Yes; at least officially.  Not all courses are to quite the same standard.

I don't think your suggestions are proportionate to the harms of cycling. If some training was all that was required to stop undesirable behaviour there would be no speeding in cars as everyone has a license!

It is entirely in the governments interest to enforce/promote ways to live and it does it all the time! Car ownership is heavily taxed (road tax which goes up with engine size), insurance and license is mandatory and petrol is also heavily taxed. If you think that government has no role in shaping society and our way of life then there are very few politicians that would support your view. 

The point of that report, and many others like it, is that cycling is far safer in terms of its impacts on pedestrians than cars. There are plenty of figures to support it. A bike travelling at 15mph weighing 15kg simply has far less potential to cause damage to others than a 900kg car travelling at 25mph. 

I also think it is very unlikely that you can significantly reduce congestion by improving the road system. Increasing the capacity of roads and the ease of travel by car encourages further car use and then you end up back at square one with the same amount of congestion as before. I'm not sure what you think infrastructure is spent on, but the bulk is spent on cars, with much less spent on cycling. I don't think anyone is advocating getting rid of all spending on cars, but of shifting this money and using it better.

As for cutting car usage, give them the incentive and I think they'll do it. If public transport was cheap, quick, easy to use, and available 24 hours, I bet more people would use it. Glasgow and London actually have very high public transport usage statistics, mainly because the infrastructure exists. If cycling was safer, dryer, quicker, less tiring, more people would switch to that too.

I think the only way to fix the first issue is to nationalise public transport, and make the service serve the people as much as possible (instead of companies only running profitable routes).

Sorry, but I don't think you can assume I want the ""monarchy"" or NHS scrapped, simply because I don't want to give money to a business I very rarely use. Change to a subscription, people who want it will pay. It's not like the NHS where one day you might really need it unexpectedly and immediately so it's worthy paying or a political establishment (although it might as well be), it's a TV and radio broadcaster, it's hardly going to save my life.

If you was forced to suddenly start paying for Netflix at £150 a year, you would be annoyed. And then if you refused to pay it, you was classed as criminal you would be even more pissed off. But because it's the ""BBC, one of the greatest media organisations in history"" suddenly it's different. Also, whats great about the BBC? Sherlock? QI? Top Gear? Yea, I can get all of those at a cheaper price than the tv tax. I guess the pedophile ring needs it's money though.

From the very article you linked ""Last year a total of 155,000 people were convicted of not having a valid licence and received a fine as a result.
But unlike the non-payment of utility bills and parking tickets which are treated as civil matters, those who refuse to pay the television licence receive a criminal record.
The maximum penalty for non-payment is a £1,000 fine, but anyone who refuses to pay, or is unable to pay the fine can end up in prison."". But fuck my ""right wing"" agenda right? I mean, this is totally justified and totally good deed that is happening and not in anyway corrupt. I do love how you linked me a right wing newspaper as your ""proof"" though.

&gt; However it is possible to claim an exemption if you can demonstrate that you only watch television programmes via the various catch up systems available on the internet, such as the BBC’s iPlayer.

From the same article you linked. Okay, fair enough..simple question...how exactly are you going to be able to prove that? BBC doesn't keep track of who watches what on what, so it's up to you to demonstrate right there in court that you watched it on BBC Iplayer? Considering 155,000 people would convicted last year, I'm guessing it's not exactly working nor is it easy to provide proof. And considering since the same article says the figure is rising, I'm going to say this ""exemption"" is utter bullshit. Only a person who keeps complete record of their life could prove such a thing, it's nonsense. It's bullshit and you know it.

The subreddit is a total joke, I agree. Only me, w'll and shoe even do anything, we aren't allowed direct control over the subreddit as some guy created it before us and added all of his mates as admins and they just sit there doing nothing. If you look at the logs, 3 names come up regularly and the only other time I've even spoken to some of them is in the mod mail, presumably because it allowed them to clear their notifications. It's very frustrating but it's what we have. Everyone else is not some competitive player or something like that, it's literally not as interesting as that.

 There's not a ""super secret ukdota skype group"" - It's just a skype group for the players that play competitive Dota in the UK, a place to talk. It's been advertised on here a few times but the last few times it didn't see that much interest. Myself and a few others regularly go around and add teams that aren't part of it to the group, it's very open.  All you actually have to do is ask to join. The skype group is a great thing, it allows communication between everyone in the competitive scene and it gets used a lot. The only people that have been removed from it are Bainshie and Kaneo, both for different specific reasons but the same underlying reason. We have players from 6k to 2k in the skype chat, this isn't a super secret elite list of players, you just didn't bother to ask for contacts or help. The skype group was actually created to *aid* in helping the lower teams / players find contacts, the very opposite of the thing you are implying.


Why would we have a permanently stickied post where people can post their steam IDs? It's just not a good idea. If people are looking for other people actively they'll post and typically someone will respond offering helpful advice which is more targetted towards the person's needs, I generally reply when I can and I'm sure other people do too. The scene isn't ""small and enclosed"" at all, you just haven't bothered to try. There's a chat channel, there's a UKDota guild, I'm literally reading and responding to every single thread, question or comment in these 3 places I can. Also, dumping advice threads / guides / useful information that would take time to produce onto the subreddit is really risky because the head admin of this subreddit could just come here one day and remove everyone's access and have a power trip since we literally have no idea who he is or why he even made the subreddit in the first place. That's why more has not been done with it as of yet.


People have tried to make communities, there used to be a ukdota.net teamspeak that was free to join but typically they didn't work. There's issues with the UKDotaIHL that I don't care to get into, but stuff like that didn't work and all the people that have tried have sorta given up because frankly, there are certain groups of people that end up making it extremely difficult to make an open and easy to join community.

If someone else hadn't commented on the fact that the live coverage had said the same thing - I would swear I was mistaken as that part seems to have disappeared now.   

I also note that the article was Last updated at 16:43 and I posted, based on its original form at about 14:00(ish)

Did the BBC make a mistake and then edit it out? Who knows, but it did seem contradictory at the time to what was published on the Guardian site.

Edit - BBC 1 just announced (9pm) that there was no way the murder was preventable. This whole thing is confusing me now.

As for your the interviews themselves, you will probably have two interviews at Hertford, where you will be given a case and the relevant statute half an hour beforehand and the interview will basically just be a discussion about this. I wasn't asked anything about current affairs or any of the academic stuff on my personal statement, but they will probably ask you a question about something co-curricular you have done at the start of each interview to settle you in. My advice would just be to relax and make sure you think before you speak. I thought my interviews were a nightmare but still got in, they will just try and stretch you.

Islam is a set of beliefs like any other and should be open to criticism like any other. As it happens, like many religions, Islam is particularly brutal and authoritarian. Islamic beliefs are pretty nasty when it comes to homosexuals, women, apostates etc and has numerous incitements to violence in its scripture.

British people who were born in Ireland under British rule. Still not foreign, not until there's a United Ireland under it's own rule.

Personally, I wouldn't want Pulis at Villa. I see what you mean in that he might stabilize the club, but  I think his cameo with Crystal Palace has glossed over the awful football style he espouses. He might toughen us up, something we badly need, but his transfer record is fairly uninspiring and he specializes in securing safety with no higher ambition. We've had 4 and a half years of no ambition at Villa. I wish we'd go for someone like Pochettino, Martinez or Bielsa. Guys who relish the challenge, preach good football, genuinely believe they can win every match and instill this belief in the players. They're clever in the transfer market, too, and don't plunder millions on mediocrity. Not to mention it would be a nice break from Scottish stubbornness running the show.

That said, last season Skrtel played the same number of minutes roughly as Sakho and Agger combined.  Sakho and Agger largely split duties at LCB, occasionally due to injuries, but it was not unheard of for Sakho to be dropped for Agger either.

Fast forward a year, we're willing to let Agger go for proverbial peanuts (someone who was considered better than Sakho on occasion the year previous), Skrtel is still here, and we get Lovren.

The only time Skrtel has been left out in favor of Lovren at RCB was when he was injured.

Sakho was dropped from the bench and stormed out when Lovren was selected over him.

I really don't see any other way to read all of this then Sakho is 2nd choice to Lovren.  I don't agree with it as I personally would have kept Sakho + Agger and looked for a RCB instead, just the way I see the situation as it stands.

As you say, though, time will tell, particularly once Sakho is fit again.

&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong but XRP is not meant to have value.. it's just the water that supports transactions and faster and cheaper than traditional money transfers.. and yet market cap #2 seems a bit odd.

I find talking about XRP as a currency inherently unhelpful to be honest, because it does lead to endless confusion. You are sort of right in that XRP is a bridging currency, meant to facilitate trade between other currencies. However, for this to work, it must have a value against those other currencies. A Ripple transaction might (if this route happens to be the cheapest at the time), for example, go GBP -&gt; XRP -&gt; USD. Clearly, XRP must have a value that you can express against both GBP and USD. As such, it has a de facto floating value against all the currencies used within the Ripple network.

Finally, it also acts as a check on spamming the market. Each transaction over the Ripple protocol causes a tiny fraction of 1 XRP to be permanently destroyed. This is much too small to be noticeable on all but the very smallest transactions, but it makes it unfeasibly expensive to computationally spam the network.

&gt; The total number of XRP seems to change wildly and the market cap jumps a few weeks back from that - which is why it seems bogus

The total number of XRP in existence is capped at just under 100bn, of which about 31bn have been sold into the market. The fluctuations in its market cap are, as far as I can see, down to the shifting value of XRP against primarily USD, but also BTC, JPY, CNY and EUR. The market is quite immature still, and volatility is to be expected - this I suspect is the cause of the ""wildly changing"" value you mention.

&gt;  Why should anyone that isn't a 'gateway' buy XRP and why should we care what traction you have for GBP/XRP?

The only reason I can see that people other than gateway providers and market makers are buying XRP is that they hope that the value of XRP will increase (as indeed it has been doing in a big way in the last couple of weeks). I think this trend will diminish as the market matures because it is not, as you note, the ultimate aim of the Ripple protocol. Rather, as you again have correctly put it, XRP will become much more important for its function as a medium of exchange, rather than an asset to be traded in and of itself. The reason I mentioned it was because the GBP/XRP pair currently forms the vast majority of Ripula's volume, and if anybody wanted to check the transaction ledger to do some due diligence on Ripula's behaviour, that would be the easiest pair to look at.

&gt;  How would anyone promote Ripple over Bitcoin; surely Ripple is not a currency, it's a utility like Western Union??.. is there more to it than that?

I do not think that there is any more to it than that at all, but I do know that there is endless scope for partisan feeling and internecine sniping in the wider crypto- and digital currency community, with lots of people considering that ""their"" currency is the only one worth considering. On a personal level, I don't care about any of that - people should choose whichever works best for their needs. I suppose I ""promote"" Ripple only in as much as I want to try and make it easier for people to use more or less any currency they want.

&gt; Surely that it is Ripple, should not matter to anyone wanting BTC in exchange for GBP.. or would we need to care to use that.. would we need to have a Ripple account to get at the BTC?

I think that its important that people should know about the technology underlying their transaction protocol if they want to, so I didn't want to hide anything there. At the moment, yes, people do need a Ripple wallet in order to be able to transact through Ripula, but we are working hard to finish our hosted account service which will abstract users much more from the Ripple internals and create a UX much like online banking. This is expected in Q2 2015.

&gt; What is a Ripple provider useful for??...

I suppose the term ""Ripple provider"" is a bit of a misnomer. More specifically, Ripula is a provider of digital currency services based on the Ripple protocol.

&gt; Tell me I'm missing the point..

You are not missing the point - rather you have pretty well hit the nail on the head. However, the technology remains very new and I am averse to hiding, or to appear to be hiding anything from anyone. Thus in the interests of full disclosure, I feel it's important that people at least know the name of the protocol that my company's services are based on so they can research it, and even go and read the [source code](https://github.com/ripple/) if they so choose.

Apologies for the wall of text, but I hope I've addressed your concerns to  the best of my ability. Unfortunately, there's a bit too much there for a tl;dr but courage! It is (in my opinion) interesting stuff.

Personally I thought Nottingham was a city that had everything I needed - great city centre with a mix of shops, bars, clubs etc, something for everyone. It's also not too far from the countryside, and there's a great nature reserve outside the city in Attenborough. When I did my MSc, I did look at halls (there is only one hall which is solely of PG students, Broadgate Park has a mixture of UG and PG), but they were outside my budget - so I rented instead for ~£250/month in Beeston. Finally, yes very normal to work along post-graduate study - several on my course were in part-time jobs, while one was working full-time and doing the MSc on a part-time (2 year) basis.

That Clapham Junction one you show seems to be a similar story (above a shop).  No one's claiming it's not the dumbest thing in the world to light up a shop with a residence above it, but it's a bit of a stretch to claim the arsonist was targeting the residential property not the business (even in cases where the fires were intentionally set and not just a result of recklessness/negligence).

But yes, it was a miracle more people weren't killed, and as I've already said, arson is stupid.

Edit: It's also worth noting that accidental fires and arsons happen on any given night (as do murders, muggings etc.), which is why some of the reports about stuff which went down during the riots are also misrepresentations, just as it is when people talk about the stabbings at Notting Hill Carnival.  They're assuming that over a normal 3 day period or whatever the same population of people would be 100% peaceful, which is of course a nonsense.

I know a decent amount about another business (close to the old Sainsbury's site) who were offered a good chunk of cash for their property who weren't at all keen to move, not because they were hoping for a bigger pay out but because while the offered sum was a seriously good deal for the property the amount of time, design and money investment in the manufacturing area they'd put in alone outweighed that by far. That's not to mention the high street location, when the alternative they were offered were way off piste.

They were also facing a CPO at the time (for the ""regeneration"" project) and couldn't have been more furious: they were not trying to be money grubbing, they just finally managed to get their site into a really good state to do what they do best and now they were told to go fuck off because someone else's private business was, apparently, more important than theirs.

If the sheet metal company was otherwise profitable and had their tooling set up just so, I can well see how they'd just want nothing the fuck to do with any of this and would *really* just like to keep doing what they do, ""princely sum"" or no (bear in mind said sum needs to cover the loss of business and customer confidence caused by the delays of a move).",0,1416950785,null,0,1418346513,0,cmcyv3l,t3_2nczin,t1_cmcyv3l,t1_cmcjwsj,null,1425842361,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Also, it seemed more reasonable to buy several players for lesser money than someone for 60m (e.g Di Maria) as we were severly lacking squad depth. Of course those players haven't performed, yet, but that's another issue.

Liverpool haven't bought a world class player in recent history and probably will not anytime soon. To get a chance to sign a truly world class player, basically planets have to align for Liverpool.

http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/savings-accounts-best-interest
http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts
Basically your best options fall into two camps:

* A high interest current account
* A tax free ISA

A high interest current account will give you easy access to your money while providing a higher interest rate that you're going to find in other kinds of accounts, including ISAs.
However these accounts come with certain ""hoops"" your going to need to jump through. The two most common are that you have to pay x amount into them each month. This number is normally between £500-1000 each month. And x amount of direct debits each month, normally 2. If you don't have any direct debits than can be an issue, as getting ones you don't need will cost each month and each into your interest.

A tax free isa is a savings account where you don't pay tax on the interest gained. The article above will give you the exact numbers of the best accounts but you should aim for at least 1.5%. These accounts can also have restrictions such as not allowing you withdraw your money for a year, however it is completely possible to get an account with no restrictions and a good interest rate. A key thing to note is that you can only deposit a max of 15,000 per financial year (April 1st to 31st March). For example, if you deposit the 10,000, then withdraw it all again, you can only deposit 5,000. So make sure you aware of this when withdrawing.

My suggestion, and feel free to ignore this as it might be more complicated than you can be bothered with, is two open a Santander 123 current account, and a Halifax Reward Current Account. (You are allowed more than one current account! People sometime forgot this).

Deposit the entire 10,000 into the Santander Account, and put £2 into the halifax account. Set up two direct debits for 2 charities in each account for £1. This will cost you £4 a month, you'll make this back with benefits by fulfilling the terms of accounts, and you get to donate to charity. A lot of charities wont you donate less than 2 pound but have a look around, 1 pound is more than enough to cover their costs so you don't need to feel bad about only donating £1.

Set up a standing order to pay 750 pounds from Santander to halifax each month, and then another standing order paying 750 from halifax to santander. This counts as paying 750 into each account! Fulfilling the terms of the accounts.

Each month halifax will give you £5, and santander will give you 2.4% on your balance after tax minus a 2 pound fee. So some simple maths gives you £25, minus 6 pounds in direct debits for a total of £19 each month.

A bit of work to set up but once you've done it, it takes care of itself. This is an equivalent rate of approx 2.3%, a rate you'd be hard pressed to beat without even more complexity.
