If we have to fit time for three characters in, then even more plot will need to be trimmed - and the plots tend to be secondary to character in NuWho as it is. This would tend to make them even more rushed or simplistic.

I mentioned in the subject that it was a matter of urgency and finished off the main body of the email mentioning that I'd circulated the message via social media (which I had).

Somebody came back to be within a few hours. Still took them a while to sort out the whole mess and they threw in a few more mishaps along the way for old times' sake but it seemed this way was the only way to actually get my issue actioned. Nobody in the customer service team cared about the fact that we'd been flat out lied to in order to get us to sign up to a contract (it was regarding network coverage in certain areas - or lack thereof) and they didn't seem bothered that they were basically holding the number (via pac code) hostage.

My theory is the Cybus Cybermen were sent to Victorian days and zapped off into time and space at the end of “The Next Doctor”.

false,ThexComposer,k9,K-9,"I used to have a theory about this as part of explaining this, in terms of other continuity snarls caused by Miracle Day.

Out-of-universe logic: Miracle Day caused too many problems to incorporate into the Doctor Who canon... so many plots running concurrently would have needed altered, much less finding an explanation for how something so massive happened without Eleven getting involved, why Amy and Rory were Earth-side when it happened and weren't affected/didn't mention it... combined with partially leaving BBC control with the Starz co-production...

My headcannon (and I just looked it up and other seem to have the same thought) is that when Eleven rebooted the Universe in ""The Big Bang"", the continuity between the two shows was split as a side effect.  So Torchwood takes place in Universe A (where the Battle of Canary Wharf, Dalek's stealing the earth, the End of Time, Children of Earth, and Miracle Day happened).  Doctor Who is now set in Universe B following the Doctor's actions, which is why people in Universe B don't mention (or remember) the Universe A events.  It also helps to settle some discontinuity in more recent scripts, like how humanity had abandoned space travel in ""Kill the Moon"" but has a long established Mars base in ""The Waters of Mars"" in too few years apart.

However, this got muddied up in ""Day of the Doctor"", when Jack's vortex manipulator showed up in the Black Archive.  Which means Jack is still around in the new universe.  So we have Jack in continuity A following the Miracle Day plot, and another Jack in continuity B doing god knows what until he eventually gives the Vortex Manipulator to UNIT.

So, TL;DR: As of the ""The Big Bang"", Torchwood: Miracle Day and Doctor Who seem to take place in distinct, parallel realities.  Miracle Day didn't impact Missy's plan because it never happened in her reality.

I also agree that Capaldi has been amazing as the Doctor, but I think the silliness of some of episodes are intentional because his portrayal is a little darker than the three previous regenerations of New Who. I even think he has more edge than the War Doctor. Doctor Who has always had a young audience, and it seems that this demographic has grown with the fun of the Smith era. Therefore, the writers are trying to strike a balance between the fascinating darkness of Capaldi and the silliness that engages in the younger audience and makes them more appreciative of the darker moments.

As Britain hits the midway mark of its decade of planned austerity, the findings suggest that far from the cuts becoming lighter after 2015 – as the chancellor and prime minister David Cameron have suggested – they are poised to become much harsher for departments outside the protected areas of health, schools and overseas aid.

The findings will come as a blow to the Conservative party which, only six months away from a general election, is seeking to attract voters with talk of more tax cuts.

Britain is exactly at the halfway point of a planned nine-year programme of cuts, and the second half promises to be more difficult than the first, whichever party wins the next general election.

Many experts, including the International Monetary Fund, say taxes will have to rise in the next parliament or more money will have to be borrowed to prevent a serious hit on many public services.

Mr Cameron wrote last month that most of the cuts in the austerity programme had been achieved, with only £25bn a year still to be removed from budgets.

But the FT’s analysis has found that less than half the reductions have been made. The analysis is based on the Office for Budget Responsibility’s Budget figures from March, which outline the government’s spending plans until 2018-19.

If the next government continues to ringfence health, schools and overseas aid, the non-protected departments face real cuts of 33 per cent, compared with the 21 per cent cuts they faced between 2009-10 and 2014-15.

The FT examined the plans for government departments’ current expenditure after adjusting for expected inflation between 2014-15 and 2018-19 – the second half of this government’s package of cuts to eliminate its borrowings.

The level of cuts are nearly twice the £25bn estimate because that figure does not include planned cuts for two years out of the nine – 2015-16 and 2018-19 – and takes no account of the effect on departmental spending of rising numbers of pensioners and increases in pension payments. The Institute for Fiscal Studies last month criticised 

Mr Cameron for omitting the first and last year of the next parliament when calculating the size of the cuts to be made.

Even if the chancellor manages to cut welfare payments by another £12bn a year, as he promised in January, this would not be enough to prevent deeper overall cuts for government departments during the next parliament.

In the March Budget documents, data show that after taking account of inflation, the coalition cut annual day to day spending by government departments by £25bn between 2009-10 and 2014-15.

The Conservatives plan to increase the pace of these cuts over the next parliament, removing another £48bn from the total, reducing the total spent in departments from £312bn in 2014-15 to £264bn in 2018-19.

So far, the public sector has coped better than many expected. But with employees more restless about slow wage growth and the easier cuts already achieved, many experts think taxes are more likely to rise than fall after the next election to protect public services and keep the deficit falling.

The OBR and the Treasury have seen the FT’s findings but both declined to comment.

Not an economist so the bit below is likely to be wrong:

If the government reduced tax on businesses then it would have to increase personal taxes (Charging things as business expenses is already the source of a large number of tax loopholes)

With increased personal taxes and reduced business taxes companies would have to pay employees more to make up the deficit

This makes employees more expensive which punishes businesses have a high employee:profit ratio and rewards businesses with a high ratio. The creates pressure towards unemployment (and with reduced business taxes then unemployment reduces government income necessitating even higher personal taxes causing a vicious cycle)

The other (weaker imo) argument is that businesses consume public services paid by the taxpayer and therefore should have to pay taxes.

Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, 


Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, 



Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs 


And towards our distant rest began to trudge.



Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots


 
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; 



Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots



Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.



Gas! Gas! Quick, boys! – An ecstasy of fumbling, 



Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time; 



But someone still was yelling out and stumbling, 



And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime. . . 


Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light, 


As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 


In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, 


He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 


If in some smothering dreams you too could pace 


Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 


And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 


His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin; 


If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 


Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, 


Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud


Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, 


My friend, you would not tell with such high zest


To children ardent for some desperate glory, 


The old Lie; Dulce et Decorum est

*Father's Day*

*The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances*

*Boom Town*

I also quite like the World War Three Slitheen episodes, but they're basically optional and not very highly rated.

**Series 2:**

*The Christmas Invasion* (Thought I ought mention it)

*Tooth and Claw* (maybe)

*School Reunion*

*The Girl in the Fireplace*

*Rise of the Cybermen/Age of Steel*

*The Impossible Planet/Satan Pit*

*The Runaway Bride*

**Series 3:**

*Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks*

*Human Nature/The Family of Blood*

*Blink*

*Voyage of the Damned*

**Series 4:**

Everything except *Fires of Pompeii* and *The Unicorn and the Wasp*

All of Tennant's Specials from 2009

**Series 5:** 

I'd say just about all of S5 is pretty necessary, though there also aren't any properly bad episodes in there. *Vampires of Venice* is mediocre, but the rest are between good and stellar.

**Series 6:**

This is getting tricky now. Watch everything if possible, though you can skip *Night Terrors*, *God Complex*, and maybe *The Girl Who Waited* if you're really in a rush, but the latter two are some of my favourites, though I don't think a number of this sub like them.

**Series 7:**

Bloody hell. Watch all five from S7A. I'm not fond of S7B, but definitely watch *Crimson Horror* and *Nightmare in Silver*.

Also, all the Specials, especially the 50th.

**Series 8:**

You might as well watch all of this current series if you're still committed to the idea. I wouldn't dream of saying which episodes from it are good on this sub, I'd get mauled. :P

I wouldn't vote Tory if it meant I were better off, though; my moral conscience forbids me. To paraphrase someone I don't recall: Society is only as rich as it's  poorest citizen. That's my ethos.

That doesn't appear to be the stance of the majority though - there's so much bitterness and blame; the dissolution of responsibility by finger pointing. People seem less concerned with providing for their own as they do making sure others lose out, especially if they're working class, or Muslim, or Eastern European.

....n-no? That doesn't follow from what I said in the slightest. I don't really understand the connections your brain made there. Maybe you should reread my comment?

I certainly didn't imply you were a ""childfucker""; I said ""rapist"", not ""child rapist"". And I didn't say ""Only""; I explicitly said ""I'm sure there are other sources [for your belief]"", but it's the one that jumps out to me. And the logic doesn't apply to the statement ""childfuckers should be put to death"" in the slightest; My argument was about your belief of pedophiles in general (that *all* of them have or will rape children), and doesn't say anything about pedophiles that actually rape children.

Rapists think that everybody is a rapist, essentially (as supported by numerous studies). Here, you think everybody who finds kids attractive is a rapist, so it's a different situation, but... I'm sure you can see how they're somewhat similar. The idea being ""Nobody can go through life without having sex with the targets of their attraction"". If the belief is extended, it implies that all normal people will eventually rape if they don't get enough sex.

Though you go on to say crazy things like ""pedophiles literally have no hobbies, all they do is rape children and think about raping children"" (paraphrasing), so it's more likely it's less about your twisted views of human sexuality and more that you're just a crazy person. But whatever.

&gt;that's a good way to try and discredit people who say something you don't like.

B-but you said ""If you believe they should live then you are only supporting them."" and ""their lives are dedicated to raping children and the only way to stop them is to end their lives in the most painful manner possible. If you don't accept this, YOU support the paedophiles.""

You're trying to discredit people who don't want to conduct torture-filled genocide of 5% of the population by implying they're pro-child rape.

&gt;

&gt;The __Easter Lily__ is a [badge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badge) worn at [Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter) by [Irish republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_republicanism) as symbol of remembrance for Irish republican combatants who died during or were executed after the 1916 [Easter Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Rising). Depending on the political affiliations of the bearer, it can also commemorate members of the pre-[Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty) [Irish Republican Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army), the post-Treaty [Irish Republican Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army_(1922-1969\)), and either the [Provisional IRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_IRA) or the [Official IRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Irish_Republican_Army). It may also be used to commemorate members of the [Irish National Liberation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_National_Liberation_Army).

Does the email give details of a UK registered trade mark? If so, you can look it up on the IPO website and see what kinds of goods and services it protects. Does your SO's blog relate to any of those goods or services?

This may not be popular but I'd like to see nasri leave if City do get Reus. I'd also love to see khedira at city. I dont think any of those transfers are impossible. I think next summer will be busy. As for January I don't think there's much changes we need to make in terms of the squad. Our problem seems to be a mental one within the team for whatever reason. As Pellegrini said we just need to figure out the problem and implement the solution. This team will get back to winning ways I'm sure of it. So no, I wouldn't want or expect big changes in January, but in the summer I can see big changes happening.

Clara pretending to be the Doctor was an entertaining way to have her escape from the Cybermen.

It's like asking why they bothered to make the Doctor President, really didn't lead anywhere and could have been switched around but it was entertaining as heck.

Why did Missy pair up Clara and The Doctor? This one could have further reaching consequences or it could be because Clara has saved the Doctor's life, something Missy likes because she doesn't want him dead. ALSO, it was Clara's morale guidance that caused the Doctor to save Gallifrey instead of burn it, thus saving The Master herself from dying. Nice bow.

How can both sides win?

My answer (as an outsider) is that this generation has already won to an extent. 

But is it sustainable? My only answer (that I liked well enough) was to make Belfast one of the coolest cities in the world. 

I see how Dubvronik kind of has a long history of this in relation to Croatia and the other former countries that once owned it. Visited there too. 

In NI, everyone: Catholic &amp; Protestant, atheists or whoever were super friendly to us. I even have an acquaintance who moved to Belfast, still lives there &amp; loves it.

Because you then have to hire someone. Sherwood wasn't necessarily a worse option, but we and the management knew that he wasn't going to lead the club past the end of the season, and therefore firing AVB and hiring Sherwood would only contribute to instability at the club and not to results.

Moreover, managers need time. It was a huge adjustment at the beginning of last season for the team, and we all know that managers (and new players, of which we had 7), need time to adjust.

In another thread I've just commented on, which is on a similar topic, someone brought up having an Ood as a companion - a human and an Ood might work, even if it was only for a few episodes. Really, I just want 2 or ideally 3 long-term companions, rather than people like Mickey or Danny, who appear but aren't 'main' characters.

for me, there are many reasons that eventually just turned into one big love for the team. Let me first remind you that growing up and living in south florida, there's no team that you're born into and everyone is usually split between real Madrid and barcelona. so wen some people on this sub complain about all these new fans, keep in mind that they're usually American and some of us don't have a team to support. Anyways, it all First began around the 08-11 years wen the squad had so many black players... idk why but I just thought it was so cool that the team was so good and we had so many black players, it's weird but that was one of the factors.  Then, wen Fernando Torres was bought, he was one of my favorite players at the moment and well that also contributed into me getting in to Chelsea as I would watch some of his games. Next,  this was probably the biggest factor of them all,  in the middle school that I went to,  everyone was either barca or real, and I was torn between following the barca bandwagon or going for a team no one liked, (my middle school years were from 09/10 - 11/12 which were like barca's golden years) and finally in the 11/12 champions League campaign, I had been following Chelsea throughout the whole tournament and wen barca and Chelsea were drawn to play each other in the semi final, that's wen I decided to make my final decision and Chelsea won my heart. It was the perfect story of the underdog becoming the winner in all the stages of the knock out rounds and I remember crying my eyes out wen Drogba scored the equalizing header and realizing that this was my team.  After that just watching videos and hearing stories made me grow even more as a fan and now as a junior in high school I am proud to say that I am a true Chelsea fan regardless of how I became one and that it truly bothers me when people from London on this sub get salty about ""plastic fans"" because I guess you could say I am one but I haven't stopped supporting and I still watch every game that I can and I cry out for every goal that goes in so whether you like it or not, I love Chelsea with all my blue heart.",0,1415576065,null,0,false,0,clxvksf,t3_2lrn8s,t1_clxvksf,t3_2lrn8s,null,1426105957,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

&gt; The obvious change that needs to happen is for Levy and his ENIC pals to get out of our club and take the toxic, money-grabbing, soul-less atmosphere they’ve fostered with them.

The rest talks about the players and pochettino. Like i have said numerous times on this sub. Levy has done many things right for our club and also done many things to hold it back. The lack of our club's identity is due to the fact that there has been no consistency in managers and players which is Levy's fault. That lack of consistency is now coming back to bite us in the arse. But to say he is the REASON that we fail is short sighted. Getting rid of ENIC will not suddenly elevate our club to new heights. 


ENIC have done a lot off the pitch to improve our club. However, other things have suffered. The club is now in a perfect position to be bought by a large investor due to the infrastructure that Levy and ENIC created, anyone remember the Sugar days ffs? 

Also, the Levy out and ENIC out talk need consistency. If Kane puts that header away in the first five minutes and we win, no one would be saying anything. all of a sudden there isnt a fundamental problem with our club. But because we need someone to blame, its levy, its enic, etc. Calling ENIC ""Money-grabbing"" in the modern game is silly. Football is a money game. Clubs need to make a shit ton of money to be successful. So either make a concrete argument as to why levy needs to go out regardless of the football or go out and support your fucking team with all your heart.

He made some poor signings. So fucking what. Wenger, Ferguson and Mourinho have all made countless terrible signings with a much greater budget. The most important thing is he used what he had to create fantastic attacking football.

We reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League after winning at the San Siro. I suppose that was just luck as well. Seriously, I am tired of reading nonsense on here about Redknapp. He kept things simple. The players loved it and the freedom the team played with was embraced by the Lane. Jamie Carragher said he hated coming to WHL because we were such a vibrant attacking force. Redknapp didn't flummox the players with complex tactics. He made them feel good and encouraged them to express themselves, and it worked brilliantly.

See what these foreign coaches don't get is that you often win home games in England by getting the crowd on their feet. Surge forward, spray the ball out wide, get the stadium rocking and our talented players will tear teams apart.

I suppose, for the record, I still have not warmed up to Capaldi. I loved Coleman in every scene, but Capaldi just kind of pissed me off most of the time. Add to the fact that Coleman was probably a better Doctor than Capaldi this series.

(Spoilers)

At the very end, when Clara and Doctor meet at the cafe, I was thinking ""OK, now we're going to have the big A-ha! moment."" Turns out I'm wrong. But there's still 4 minutes of the episode left. I'm thinking something's coming up. Nope. He lied, she lied, ""See you next incarnation."" The End.

Michelle Gomez as the Master was completely underused if they really killed her off that effortlessly. Why didn't someone shoot her earlier? I thought she was going to be a significant player in Series 9. I suppose you could say she did have a series-wide story arc but it was not done well. We saw her for a few minutes at a time, after some supporting character died. Yes, that's a mystery. Yes, it was solved. I don't think the resolution was satisfying and I would even say it was dull.

In the end, her master plan was an army of Cybermen to give to the Doctor and the end? The big question of the series was ""Is the Doctor a good man?"" That's it? Evidently it is. I sat through so many moments in these episodes thinking ""Why doesn't [insert name here] just [insert obvious action in circumstances]?"" 

Most obvious example of this is the two guards standing right behind Missy, while she un-handcuffs herself, freshens up her lip stick, smacks her lips, replaces the cap and hops up and moves across the entire room. At some point, she also slipped her handcuffs into Osgood's coat apparently? In fact, if you look closely, one guard out of focus can be seen looking at her as she puts the lipstick cap back on.

Because of that clause he's equally possible for every other big club. The reason it's unlikely is because every team will be going for him.

Ok, so I had this thought.
We are lead to assume that Missy/the Master has been enacting her plan since the concept of an afterlife came about in humans, or at least long enough for the plan to work. My thought was how did the miracle day phenomenon affect or alter Missy’s plan.
As far as I can remember, ‘Miracle Day’ lasted around a year, starting in March 2011. Yes those that should have died did so eventually, in one form or another. But, there were mass burnings of ‘corpses’ – criminals and those that should have died – all over the world during the latter half of the phenomenon. This is in conflict with Missy’s plan was to prevent the cremating of corpses, using the 3W organisation as a front with the ‘discovery’ of the message “Don’t Cremate Me”, so that she could research how to convert the dead to cybermen/have bodies that could be converted to cybermen when the time was ready.
So, what do people think. Did Miracle Day help or hinder Missy?",0,1415579114,null,0,false,0,clxx6ep,t3_2lpgwc,t1_clxx6ep,t3_2lpgwc,null,1426105149,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

- service has been slow and sometimes non-existent to our forwards
- our defenders are having to punch above their weight and not play to their strengths.  Moreno and Manquillo can't do Moreno and Manquillo  things if they're constantly stuck in no mans land on the outside. 

- There's no direction in our link up play in midfield.  What's Gerrard's role with this team exactly?  How do we deal with the change in pressing?  Who leads the attack?  Where do you allocate Lallana and Coutinho?  What's Sterling's role?  The list goes on.

The current course doesn't even teach C++ until the third year, although I believe this has been moved or will be moved to the second year from this or next year. As far as learning programming for games goes, it teaches very little about what it takes to make games and sometimes teaches the exact opposite of reality. And that's not just the programming course. On the games art course, they were told to model everything using quads because 'that's how game engines want the data', which exactly how game engines don't want the data.

Almost every student I've had has considered quitting us after the first few weeks because the reality is all so far removed from what they expect and so much more difficult than what they've been taught.

They don't even tell students what a debugger is. After two years of 'learning' they all show me tiny little programs where all of the debugging has been done by print statements. There's nothing about version control, no design patterns, nothing about programming standards, nothing about how the processor works, not even any sort of explanation of a simple game loop. There's nothing about technical issues regarding any aspect of games like graphics and pixel formats, certainly nothing about shaders. In all, it's a terrible waste of student's money.

In fairness, there are very, very few good games courses in the UK. If you wanted be a games programmer, Computer Science is definitely the way to go.

false,Maverick--,null,null,"&gt;The problem with wind is that there is not nearly enough potential to support British demand, and more importantly it is very unreliable (you can't control or accurately predict how much wind there will be) and storage of electricity is incredibly expensive/inefficient. 

This is a really big point in the whole argument and if we manage to develop more efficient systems of energy storage wind will become much more viable very quickly. Concepts like using the batteries of electric cars as temporary storage capacity in a City (assuming they become more popular) are being looked at, or more common things like using the excess energy to pump water upward in a Hydroelectric plant.

It should also be noted that offshore wind is significantly more reliable than onshore, though the investment cost is higher.

I agree that wind can't provide all of our power, but that doesn't mean we should completely discount this natural resource that's massively abundant in the UK. If it can provide 20% of our energy then lets get 20% of our energy from wind, cause why not?

That's development aid. Aid given to governments by other governments. It doesn't include aid given by charities and non-profits, and doesn't include humanitarian aid given outside of developmental aid. The US is, in fact, the first country to provide aid, and it's often important aid like food, medical supplies, and personnel that has value that can't be stated financially.

Example: [Haiti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_relief_efforts_after_the_2010_Haiti_earthquake). The US was the first country outside of Latin American to respond, and did basically the majority of work. 

&gt; All the members states of the United Nations.

[The U.S. contributes more to the UN than any other country -- 22 percent of the regular UN budget and 27 percent of the peacekeeping budget](http://www.betterworldcampaign.org/issues/funding/)

[The US has committed $350m with the department of defence prepared to spend more than $1bn to control the outbreak. The US military has said it would deploy up to 4,000 troops to the region. It is sending 200,000 items of equipment, running a training centre in Liberia, and a staffing hospital for health workers.](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/09/ebola-outbreak-response-breakdown-key-funding-pledges)

The US has committed more money than any other country, but what is most important is material and personnel assets devoted to fighting Ebola that you can't just put a price tag on. 

&gt; Lebanon apparently.

&gt; Russia

The allies, including the Russians, were losing across the board in WWII before the US entered the conflict. Russia didn't liberate anyone by the way, they simply took control from the Nazis and subjugated the countries they ""liberated"".

People always say the Soviets won WWII, but the Soviets only began to make offensive progress after US-provided war aid began flooding in, and after the US opened the second front in Europe (something Canadians and Brits failed to do on their own without the US, in the disaster later euphemistically called the 'Dieppe Raid""). A liberation of western Europe would not have occurred without the US. 

Look at [this map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Persuit_to_the_West_Wall.jpg) of army deployments on the western front in Europe:

Simpson, 9th Army (USA)

Dempsey, 2nd Army (USA)

Hodges, 1st Army (USA)

Patton, 3rd Army (USA)

Patch, 7th Army (USA)

Bradley, 12 Army (USA)

Montgomery, 21st Army (UK)

Crerar, 1st Army (Canada) 

Let's quote Stalin himself, who is just about the last person who would have benefitted from admitting the importance of the US:

['The United States is a country of machines. Without the use of these machines through Lend-Lease, we would lose this war.' —Josef Stalin \(1943\)](http://www.amazon.com/Russias-Life-Saver-Lend-Lease-U-S-S-R-World/dp/0739145630)

Why don't you stop lying to yourself and others in your quest to rob the US of credit for its accomplishments?

One thing to check for is the ""Secondary Market"" so you can pull out before the full term of a loan.

For one, why is Vertonghen not playing? I always felt he was the most talented defender of yours, seems strange to start players like Naughton and Fazio over him.

Also is this Mason any good? He hasn't looked *amazing* from what I've seen (admittedly only MOTD highlights) yet he's keeping more established centre-mids out of the team.

Honestly re-watch this match if you can and you will see how Negredo was pivitol in every single goal except for Nasri's.

* Interesting to see that Nastasic started next to Kompany, how far has he dropped from starting in the manchester derby to never making the bench

&gt;__Calico cats__ are domestic [cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat) with a spotted or parti-colored coat that is predominantly white, with patches of two other colors (often, the two other colors are orange [tabby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabby_cat) and black). Outside of North America, the pattern is more usually called __[tortoiseshell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoiseshell_cat)-and-white__. In the province of Quebec, they are sometimes called *chatte d'Espagne* (French for '(female) cat of Spain'). Other names include *brindle*, *tricolor cat*, *mi-ke* (Japanese for 'triple fur'), and *lapjeskat* (Dutch for 'patches cat'); calicoes with diluted coloration have been called *calimanco* or *clouded tiger*. Occasionally, the tri-color calico coloration is combined with a tabby patterning. This calico patched tabby is called a *caliby*.

You probably need both to win league titles and Champions League trophies. Redknapp was outstanding at motivation and limited in terms of tactics. For a team of very talented players pushing for top four and maybe a cup win that is enough to be successful. Replacing that with a foreign coach who is very good at tactics but not a great motivator it's a problem at a big club like Spurs.

Pochettino, maybe with the help of translators, tries to explain how Spurs can overcome Stoke. It doesn't work because Stoke are fired up to unsettle the crowd just like Newcastle and West Brom did. When Redknapp was here, we would have been fired up ourselves from the first whistle and confident we could tear them apart, the crowd would have responded and Stoke eventually would probably have lost.

I can imagine a Redknapp team-talk... ""This is Stoke City for fuck's sake. You are playing for the famous Tottenham fucking Hotspur because you are better players. Now get that crowd going because they've paid good money. Get the ball to Lennon. He'll toast that right back because the boy is shit. Now Adebayor you are scoring today. I've got a fiver on you down Ladbrokes. Dont fucking let me down son.""

Point is... his enthusiasm would have relaxed the players and made them confident. It's not Mourinho but it's better than Pochettino and AVB with their visual aids. Mourinho strikes a balance. Mourinho once got the kitman to give a teamtalk because he knew the laughter would relax the players, and it worked. Mourinho's genius is knowing when to get detailed and knowing when to just let the players get on with it. Redknapp gets the motivation right and while he is no tactical genius, he didn't get a 1-0 win at the San Siro without serious preparation.",0,1415583889,null,0,false,0,clxzic0,t3_2lrr9e,t1_clxzic0,t1_clxz19z,null,1426104061,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

false,UseMoreDakka,null,null,"Bunny, when it comes to volunteering opportunities, I'd say skip the jobcentre and go hunting yourself.

Some background here - until recently I was working at a charity location that accepts work placements through the job centre. We got on average two placements a year despite being able to take on more, and those we were getting hadn't been matched properly to the type of work we did.

Next time you're in, ask for form VOLWORK1JP - it's a four pager that takes about ten minutes to fill in. Have a nose around local charities. The roles available will vary depending on the locations you visit - so be sure to google charities near you to find out what they do before heading out.

Charity shops? Could be on the phone organising collections from donors, responding to emails, helping to run their ebay store if they have one, arranging deliveries. The BHF furniture stores do a lot of this, and if you're good at it the store managers will love you for it.

Shelters? A bit tougher - they'll probably want paid staff due to CRBs, but they'll need people to maintain contact details for their 'clients', receiving/sorting/distributing mail, that sort of thing.

Meeting/help/support groups - mostly maintaining contacts and working relationships with the venues. Sounds tougher than it is - just remember that support groups for crime victims are unlikely to use volunteers, so you'd be looking for things like &lt;wildcard&gt; anonymous or social groups for single parents. 

Anyway, once you've found one you like the look of and is willing to take you on, fill out that form and take it back to the jobcentre. The form exists for one reason only - so that if someone sees you working and tries to dob you in for benefit fraud, the jobcentre can check the record and see that you're volunteering and have declared it.

Normal rules on hours apply though - you're only able to volunteer for 16 hours a week maximum before it affects your benefits, and you still have to be looking for work while volunteering.",0,1415584842,null,0,false,0,cly003y,t3_2lt2dm,t1_cly003y,t3_2lt2dm,null,1426103765,2,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,2

Clara was necessary to a Doctor desperate to be a hero in a time of mounting crisis. However she never lost that determination to press on as the mighty hero, even after the crisis had ended. She had been shown the city and was no longer able to tolerate the farm. And the degree to which she pushed, like a junkie running undetered to her next fix and lying about it all the way, was both part of Missy's plan AND the thing that made the Doctor realize the solution. It was the face of a corrupted companion that caused the Doctor to let go of the fear that he was the only saviour the universe could count on.

The major problems with Liverpool I believe is:

The players that Liverpool bought were disappointing in terms of what was expected and are subsequently underachieving. It is reminiscent of the Post 2009 drop from Liverpool as they almost won the title as well. Rodgers expected Balotelli to be a constant goal threat. Balotelli has not even scored in the premier league yet. Also, with so many new players, the dressing room morale is affected adversely and as the confidence drops, performance dips and it worsens. Liverpool has not won consecutive games yet and is unable to a good team mentality yet.


Rodgers simply cannot adapt to playing Champions League games midweek. There are many things that are compromised when doing this as compared to last season. Less time spent on training, preparing mentally, tactical formulation and adaptation, etc for an individual game. This is the first season in the Champions League for Rodgers as a manager and he is struggling. I think he should have made additions to his backroom staff in preparation for this season.

Suarez leaving. This will obviously have an effect as he is a game winner. It is not only the player on the field that is lost but his attitude with a Never Say Die kind of thinking, that undoubtedly rubbed off on other players. Take for example yesterday's game and I am sure he would made an impact. It is however not the reason for such a slide. There has to be a combination of factors and Rodgers is not addressing them properly.

And I would disagree with that entire section in general: Moffat has been making much more of an effort to connect the new series to the classic series than Davies did. He's played around quite a bit with the format, at times making it feel a lot more ""serialised"" in the way that classic episodes were. He brought back the Great Intelligence as a major villain, and his take on the Master was much more similar to the classic Delgado/Ainley portrayal. He brought back UNIT as major players again (I know Davies did too, but he also kind-of replaced them with Torchwood). He started to make the TARDIS feel like a family again with the Ponds, like it was during several eras of classic (most notably the Fifth Doctor's era). He tied in the Series 7 finale and the anniversary to the classic series. I don't know where the author gets the idea that Davies-era was more connected to classic than Moffat-era but I would say the exact opposite.",0,1415586543,null,0,false,0,cly0vs7,t3_2lt2hg,t1_cly0vs7,t3_2lt2hg,null,1426103353,16,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,16

I seem to remember the doctor being a genuinely intelligent character at one point, but now it seems that every plot is resolved by... well... Other people. The doctor hasn't actually saved the day by being brilliant in a while, it's just that the villains constantly hold the idiot ball. I would love to see a villain straight up out play the doctor for most of a season. Time and space hopping about setting up traps and plans for each other, small victories and massive defeats, different characters with different motivations. Enemies working together, friends turned on each other. It'd be fantastic to see.

Off the top of my head it'd be pretty manageable if you had some cliché 'quest' to set the stage for each episode. Let's say we have some piece of time Lord tech (maybe necessary to finding Galifrey) that is scattered in pieces throughout time and space. Pieces individually serve certain functions, but together do a whole lot more. It'd be very easy to establish conflicting groups with no clear cut good versus evil (some people want to use individual pieces for the greater good, others want to keep the pieces hidden to prevent catastrophe, others want the time Lords not to be found, etc) and the naturally developing conflicts would provide growth for whatever characters are involved along with a genuine sense of suspense (we head into the finale with pieces all over the place and no way of knowing who will win out in the end).

Finale rolls out 'villain' wins and it's... well actually everything is more or less fine. The villain still has an artifact or incredible power, and they intend to use it, but it's more of a grey morality situation (like if the doctor had actually used the cyber army kind of grey morality) and the doctor is knocked down a peg. Goodness and love does not win out. Pragmatism and comprise does. This leads into the next series where the doctor realises if he wants to beat this villain, he'll have to play on the same intellectual level. The return of a war doctor.

Sorry to bother, but does this mean that I don't need to apply my vitamin c serum every day? If I can save product and money, that'd be nice. I don't want to be redundant with my usage and end up wasting product.  
  
Also, is there a vitamin c agent / derivative that you prefer (if you use/diy a vitamin c serum)? I noticed you didn't list ascorbyl palmitate as an option. Is it because it's a finicky ingredient, therefore not a ""sure fire"" way of inducing vitamin c benefits? I only ask since I'm trying to get my mom a cost effective, non-acidic, stable vitamin c product and was looking at the Juju Aquamoist line (was mainly looking at the vit c cream which uses ascorbyl palmitate).    
  
Also, you mentioned photosensitivity studies with AHA. Right now I have two options, an 8% formula and a 10% AHA + 2% BHA formula. If I'm trying to avoid a bad face tan and find it hard to reapply sunscreen during the day, should I switch to my 8% formula or just give up AHA for now? I ask since it's winter time and I apply my 1/4 tsp of sunscreen in the morning, head to work (am indoors all day &amp; don't reapply) and then it's pretty much dark outside when I head back home. I also have a tretinoin gel (microsphere) at 0.04% which I alternate every other day. However, this tube is a year old now... so I'm not sure if it's really potent or effective anymore.  
  
I recently started my AHA/BHA &amp; tretinoin up again (I took a long break from them both) and now my skin is looking really smooth and awesome. This time around I'm actually waiting a good half hour for my skin to dry before applying tretinoin, and also applying 1/4 tsp sunscreen in the morning (two things I didn't do earlier -- I was dumb). I'm just not sure if I'm slowly going to tank my skin since I don't reapply sunscreen throughout the day (I'm trying to find an hg sunscreen that will let me reapply since I don't have to worry about makeup). Also, do you apply anything after your retinol, or is that your last step? I want to layer niacinamide &amp; licorice at night, but don't know when to do it in such a way that won't interfere with my retin-a (right now I layer them 30 ish minutes after I apply my tretinoin). I do understand your situation might be different since your retinol needs to convert to a retinoid, while I apply a product that's already a retinoid.

Why the Master is so intensely jealous of the attention the Doctor gives to humanity in general and to his human companions specifically.

Missy was more in between them, she was still silly, a little off the wall and unusual, but she really was The Master, she didn't feel like she was a completely different character like The Saxon/Skeletor Master.

Other than Missy, well this episode was iffy, Clara was interesting and I really did feel her emotional anguish unlike other companions supposedly going through such throughout New Who, all that happened with her felt a lot more real and hard hitting.

Peter was amazing, honestly the Twelfth Doctor, despite some of the stories, is quickly becoming my favorite since at least the Seventh.

The episode itself felt like a lot of different interesting ideas jammed together and not given enough time or actual story to back it up.

I didn't like the Cybermen just being the Master's tools (yeah I'm gonna keep using 'The Master' not Missy), they may as well have just been more Toclafene or basic Robots

Missy knew that Clara would call, which means she knew Clara wouldn't be killed, which means she knew Clara would escape the Cybermen, which means the Cybermen were never a threat to Clara. Pink rescues her with a gun that damages (not disintegrates) the other Cybermen, but pink is different (inhibitor inactive... why?) So let's ask... who else do the Cybermen use their guns on? Nobody. We see them abduct people and we see people fall out of a plane (but caught of course) and we see Missy 'disintegrate' a few people with her weapon, but with no confirmed Cybermen kills (and no possible motive for them to disintegrate instead of leaving a corpse) how do we know these Cybermen had functioning weapons (besides Pink who was different for some reason anyway).

The doctor says at the end ""you win"" and the mistress accepts that, because the doctor doesn't realise that everything went according to plan. So what was the plan? Like I said, let's look at the result and see what actually happened:

- barring santa involvement, Clara and the doctor are now separate

- the kid that Pink killed is alive again

- the doctor is aware that Galifrey is genuinely back, but still hidden

Of the three of these, the kid is the one that strikes me as the most likely planned outcome. The AI in the nethersphere set up a meeting and everything, it was important. The Mistress can be short sighted, but she knows how to play emotional ties and manipulate people. She made sure pink was in a heightened emotional state, gave him a body without the inhibitor, and let him save Clara. She knew they would be at the graveyard (I'm actually starting to think Pink was unknowingly under control the whole time). Missy is clever enough to pull all this off. So the question is, why did a time Lord who's ""right"" it is to change time bring a kid back from the dead? 

I don't know, but if Missy actually did die at the end then she's amazingly cast and stupidly written. I mean really, why would Missy outfit all her Cybermen with a weapon that could actually kill a time Lord?

3. West Ham played really awful football last season. Their unequally popular manger was given an ultimatum and modified his tactics. They were brilliant against us. Why is Lambert given a free pass on the anti-football tactics he employs?

If you were using a 10% L-AA serum and wanted the best results you'd be best to apply daily; with a 15% or 20% serum you very likely could get away with every other day say. To be clear the 'half life' as referred to in that abstract means the amount of time for the level of a drug or other active to reduce by half.

That can indeed save product (IF your L-AA serum does not oxidise before you use it up tho) and can give you the flexibility to use different products or different actives on the alternate day, you might want to alternate with a retinoid or niacinamide or an AHA/ BHA or even another form of vitamin C.

I have various C products including Paula's Choice samples, and am just starting out testing since I've finished testing retinoids and AHAs! For my own skin I favour magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (see the SCA UK Wiki) which is water soluble but not acidic/ irritating, but I hope to also end up with an oil soluble ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate (Tetra-C) product for flexibility. I like being able to pick and choose products based on whether I think I need an oil or something healing, if I'm home or out that day/ night.

TBH I'm not super familiar with oil soluble C, so I don't know how stable they are in a cream rather than anhydrous format (might be very, I just don't know). Be careful with any antioxidant in a jar, you ideally want a tube or airless pump or dark dropper bottle. Another option you have is AA2G or ascorbic acid-2 glucoside which is water soluble and can be used at more skin friendly pHs than L-AA.

false,Firefox7275,null,null,"UK this time of year with an indoors lifestyle **IMO not medical advice** photosensitivity is primarily an issue with things like prescription medication (esp. Roaccutane) or mid to deep peels. The research on 10% glycolic used 1.5 MEDs which is one and a half times the dose needed to start burning/ go pink. With a UV index of 1 and no snow you wouldn't get within a million miles of that.

However if you are using an AHA and your tretinoin gel I would be careful on sunny days or when spending time by windows (UV can penetrate glass) or if it snows. Research suggests use of some polyphenol antioxidants and of vitamin C can boost the efficacy of sunscreen - these have photoprotective properties.

Yes I apply other products after my retinol serum which is very watery and put on bare skin. I usually wait a little then either just a night oil or sometimes a light lotion or gel (niacinamide or aloe) and then an oil. My routine is unconsciously like Asian beauty in some ways now I think about it!

I can't really guide you on the tretinoin since I don't use it, plus I think that could be considered medical advice. I know people do layer under ('buffering') and layer over with appropriate wait times. Maybe ask on the main SCA sub? There should be plenty there who can tell you what their dermatologist advised, otherwise ask at a good pharmacy.

In american football there is no danger in failing. If you finish at the bottom of your table you actually get rewarded with the opportunity to get better players. Where as in football if you finish bottom, you are relegated and punished. I just dont see the competitiveness and drive to succeed in american sports. Also the culture of some of the fans is strange to say the least. There is no tradition, no club mentality, its just something thats on tv that people can make decisions for their fantasy american football team. The supporters at games just sit there and do nothing. All the chats are just fabricated through the loud speaker and stadium monitors. Do you notice this too? its so weird. There is ~~no~~ not the same passion in the fans. It just seems like a social event.

Adebayor is one of the worst things currently at Spurs, but is just talented enough to escape major criticism for all the shit he gets away with.

Levy was completely right in firing both Redknapp and AVB, but Baldini should go way before Pochettino does.

Southampton's success this season proves that Pochettino knows how to lay the foundations to a really successful club. He needs time and for once we have to be patient.

Evidence? You want evidence? I'll give you evidence.

Death in Heaven - one cyberman refused to get with the program because of the power of twoo wuv. Again? Seriously? Creativity was what died in heaven that day.

Then The Mistress (formerly The Master) died, absolutely, certainly, 100%, no tricking, oh wait, it was a teleport? Again? Seriously? Look, we *know* Missy will be back. Permanent death is rare enough in Doctor Who to start with. So, pretending that she's dead is insulting. If we're *really* lucky, it wasn't a teleport, it was a clone or robot or long-lost twin. But the death was faked. We all know it. And we're supposed to believe that the Doctor *and* Clara fell for it?

""There is no Clara. There never was."" Out of context, in the ""next week"" teaser (Forest of the Night) it was dramatic, the villain was a master manipulator. That got disarmed *very* quickly. Still, to be fair, there have been so many dramatic teasers that turned out to be the boring part of the episode, I feel stupid for falling for it again.

I refuse to believe the man who wrote ""Blink"" and ""Girl in the Fireplace"", amongst others, not to mention ""Day of the Doctor"" was also responsible for this travesty.

Mind you, I'm still angry about season 6's ""the Doctor really is dead, no kidding, we promise"" gag even though not one person on the planet believed it. Tribes of pygmies who have never been contacted by the outside world still knew the Doctor was faking his death. I just can't believe Moffat wants us to swallow that gag again.

If none of that convinces you, try this: there really were 12 episodes in this season, They didn't skip a week and play a fan-made piece of crap. ""Kill the Moon"" is what Moffat actually considered to be an acceptable quality script. I'm sorry, but it's true.

Is it because she wanted to do it or is it because she's a part of his *army?* It has been a running theme with the Doctor and his companions. The companions, in their desire to please him, becomes his tools/soldiers/weapons. Heck, even Davros told the Tenth Doctor about his tendency to do that. Clara, during this season have discovered her inner Doctor which is a new theme they have explored. I don't think they've done that with any of the NuWho companions. I still don't buy how she became his best friend because they weren't able to flesh out that relationship when she was with Eleven. But if we were to take that relationship at face value, it's a lot easier to see how Clara could do this. She found that the Doctor could lie, manipulate people, let people make the hard decisions and in turn, she learned to do the same.

I didn't have the same thought that you did OP, at least I certainly didn't delve into your thought as much, but I did kind of float that possibility to myself the other day. It's certainly possible. Organizations are most efficient and effective when the leadership at the very top is great. Trickle-down leadership as it were.

Levy certainly isn't ***the*** problem, especially since we could all write a large catalog of all the wonderful things he's done for Spurs, but he should be a part of the conversation. There is absolutely no need for anyone to get pitchforks, which is why people downvote hypotheses such as these - they fear that an angry mob is just a few seething comments away from happening.

I'll go back to Sherwood's comments about the squad, in which he excludes Eriksen and Lloris (and maybe a few other players he thinks are elite, I can't remember) and then says the rest of the squad has ""much of a muchness"" to it. They're all useful players. Not all of them are the right ones.

Early on I saw a Doctor unfamiliar with the relationship he finds himself in. I saw a man who asked a lot of questions, then carried on as he thought he was supposed to. When he encountered pushback and Clara's expectations in situations where he thought that it wasn't his place to act, he stepped back and forced her to show him what she was capable of. It was confusing to the Doctor, and he had to occasionally tap the brakes. And although that looked for all the world as a Doctor taking a back seat, it certainly seemed to be a Doctor sorting out confusion through observation.

I don't think Clara was malicious; I think she graced herself in to a position she could not handle without emotional casualty. It worked when it was supposed to because she was committed to the adventure (and the adventurer), but soon became an addiction without positive payoff. The Doctor knew that he was no longer the ""throw the world on my back"" hero that he was once forced to be (be it Earth or Trenzalore), but it was Clara's desperate behavior that convinced him.

false,KieranUK,null,null,"You know most of your evidence is total and not per capita, right? No shit that the USA spends the most on a lot of stuff - you're a first world country with 360 million bloody people.

&gt;That's development aid. Aid given to governments by other governments. It doesn't include aid given by charities and non-profits, and doesn't include humanitarian aid given outside of developmental aid. The US is, in fact, the first country to provide aid, and it's often important aid like food, medical supplies, and personnel that has value that can't be stated financially.
Example: Haiti[1] . The US was the first country outside of Latin American to respond, and did basically the majority of work.

Ok, let's look at aid given from this website: http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/country-profiles (first website google returned after searching for humanitarian aid).

UK total aid: $17.7 billion

US total aid: $30.9 billion

Seems like you guys are better than us at this, right? Wrong, you have over 5 times the population of us. Same applies for humanitarian aid on that website.

Yes, the amount you have spent on ebola per capita far outweighs the UK, but that certainly makes it sound like the USA only spends a lot on a few causes due to the per capita claim above.

&gt;The allies, including the Russians, were losing across the board in WWII before the US entered the conflict. Russia didn't liberate anyone by the way, they simply took control from the Nazis and subjugated the countries they ""liberated"".
People always say the Soviets won WWII, but the Soviets only began to make offensive progress after US-provided war aid began flooding in, and after the US opened the second front in Europe (something Canadians and Brits failed to do on their own without the US, in the disaster later euphemistically called the 'Dieppe Raid""). A liberation of western Europe would not have occurred without the US.
Look at this map[5]   of army deployments on the western front in Europe:
Simpson, 9th Army (USA)
Dempsey, 2nd Army (USA)
Hodges, 1st Army (USA)
Patton, 3rd Army (USA)
Patch, 7th Army (USA)
Bradley, 12 Army (USA)
Montgomery, 21st Army (UK)
Crerar, 1st Army (Canada)
Let's quote Stalin himself, who is just about the last person who would have benefitted from admitting the importance of the US:
'The United States is a country of machines. Without the use of these machines through Lend-Lease, we would lose this war.' —Josef Stalin (1943)

Holy fucking shit. If I had a penny for every person that thought the USA was the fucking savior of the universe during WWII, I'd be a rich man. The allies would have lost without EITHER of the following: Canada, USA, Russia and the UK. http://www.worldology.com/Europe/world_war_2_imap.htm 

The year is 1940. A fuck tonne of Europe is lost to the axis, including those countries right by the channel. If we had lost the battle of Britain, Germany wouldn't have had to fight on the western side anymore, allowing them to focus their resources on other places (e.g. Russia). US forces also wouldn't have been able to land on German-occupied Britain. Where would they have gone? I would also like to mention UK war effort in Africa.

I don't think I need to back up Russia on why they were important...

As for your innovation argument, [this](http://www.invention-ifia.ch/office/August/Innovation%20potential%20by%20countries.pdf) argues that Japan are indeed better than you. My argument of per capita also applies to the link you posted about innovation. You're 26th in tertiary efficiency? Shouldn't you be higher given the resources (land, labour, capital and enterprise) you have?

I would also like to mention the choice of sources. If you haven't realised by now, the internet has lots of [conflicting sources](http://www.idexlab.com/blog/countries-innovation-ranking)

&gt; UK total aid: $17.7 billion
&gt; US total aid: $30.9 billion

Again, that's only aid that our governments give for economic assistance to other governments, it doesn't include private charities and non-profits. It doesn't include the ~[$71 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid#Usage_of_Money_for_Support) in private assistance provided by entities within the US, or the [$17 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid#Amounts) given in military assistance. 

&gt; If I had a penny for every person that thought the USA was the fucking savior of the universe during WWII, I'd be a rich man.

Get a grip on reality. The allies were getting stomped in WWII, on every front, in every theater of war, up until the time the US entered the conflict. The US was the only country to fight significantly in every theater of war. The US did the most in N. Africa, the Med, Italy, and then Western Europe post D-day, while simultaneously fighting Japan on the other side of the world will very little help. The US did a whole hell of a lot more to help the allies against Germany than the help the US received against Japan. And the US did this while supplying not only its own military but all of the allies with literally the majority of their war material.

&gt; As for your innovation argument, this argues that Japan are indeed better than you

Wow, that's hlarious. The data in all the graphs/tables only goes up to the year 2001 at the most recent. And it's about sheer number of inventions, not the quality of inventions or their importance. The US beats Japan by a huge margin when it comes to producing paradigm-shifting technology that benefits the globe. Japan creates a lot of technology that is only really used in Japan.

false,idiodabble,null,null,"There's a lot I could say about this episode, and I'm still talking about it with friends so I haven't bubbled up in discussion everything that's most important yet. So I'll just say this for now:

There were a lot of good, intense, and funny moments in the episodes. I've been doubting Capaldi this season, but he delivered. My absolute favorite parts from him were his expression at the very end when Clara tells him ""thank you"" (I want to see a gif of that expression) and him declaring ""I'M AN IDIOT!"". I also loved seeing Clara go ice cold and then start throwing keys into lava (which I wish hadn't been dream-conned), and her bit pretending to be the Doctor was fun, and Missy had some deviously good lines, and Danny's got a thrilling speech-giving voice.

But so many other parts were crap, for instance: everything having to do with the rain-pollen-corpse-liquid-exoskeleton-cybermen and the need for a W3 makes as little sense as anything in ""Kill The Moon"" if you think about it for longer than a second, but I don't see people complaining about it. Or, for instance, is Danny REALLY the only one of those ninety-one human-turned-cybermen who felt love enough to not go around murdering people? Or how is there a portal to heaven? Or why the heck did the Master plan to keep the Doctor and Clara together? That never got explained.

But, plotholes or no, a story's most important aspect (usually) is its characters, so about Missy: One of the most touching moments of Dr Who, for me, was watching 10 try to convince the Master to be his companion. ""Because you don't need to own the universe, just see it. Have the privilege of seeing the whole of time and space. That's ownership enough."" But between his pride, his plan's success, his beat of drums, and his hunger - there was no way that the Master was in the right state of mind to accept 10's offer, which is what made it so sad. Now the Master's presumably free of both drums (no signal needed now that Gallifrey's out of the Timewar) and hunger (new regeneration), and I can believe that the Master would want to prove to the Doctor that they're actually the same, but why want it so obsessively? First time we've ever seen the Master as female, and now it's all about the Doctor, Doctor, Doctor - no goals of her own. And then she quite literally submits all her power - she who wants to be master over everything - to him. Why does every female in the Moffat era crush on the Doctor? And kiss him?

Also, did nobody ever once consider that giving the Doctor a robot army might actually be a good thing? Not a robot army that forces people's minds to suffer, of course, but how about droids with stun guns that he keeps in the TARDIS for whenever Daleks show up.

That's the trouble with the characterization of Missy, for me: This season tried so hard to make a statement about the Doctor's character, but the statement wasn't that interesting, and other characters were warped into a vessel for reflecting that message to the point that it gets in the way of what might make those characters compelling on their own right.",0,1415597262,null,0,false,0,cly5zqs,t3_2lpgwc,t1_cly5zqs,t3_2lpgwc,null,1426100897,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Ok then. [Tsunami aid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_response_to_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake). Scroll down and look at the numbers. This does include aid from the public. You spent 3.5x the amount that we did. Still not over that 5x population you have on us.

""Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!""

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.

""How old is this rock?""

The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied ""4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian""

""Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now""

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears.

The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named ""Small Government"" flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

America has very little to do with it. Even the students, merit based admissions show the top 33% are dominated by overseas students. Americans just make up the very average remainder. If only the Americans were left in americam universities the top 20 universities would all be European or Asian except for 4 IVYs and berkley and Caltech.


Now for all your space technology. Pretty much all German.  Even to this day over 80% of all wing designs in production originate from WW2 Germany. Over half of the work for any space launch in america is due to German research and development. Dr werner von braun has done more than every American space engineer ever. That is undisputed outside freedom land. 

Now war? America had started so much more shit than it has resolved it's not even funny. Even WW2 can be attributed to the US. The main reason Europe demanded such huge reparations from Germany at the end of WW1 was to pay back the US who had so kindly loan sharked the shit out of half the world. 

Don't try to act like some kind of reluctant world saviour. What a fucking joke. Check the stats, most violent first world nation in the last 100 years. Easily among the least educated. One of the lowest average IQs and just awash with a huge number of land whales. That's what this is about isn't it? Your just fat. I knew it.

Pretty much every industry America ""dominates"" can be attributed to the leveraging of war debt for the control of oil or just American stupidity.

* Google - ""everything"" for idiots
* Twitter - community discourse for idiots

&gt; The thing is over 50% of them in the top US universities are European or Asian.

Prove it. 

I do find this funny though, because if you were talking about a British university, you'd be saying that their foreign faculty and student body is proof of how good the university is, in that it attracts bright minds from around the world. But when it's American universities you argue that this means that foreigners are responsible for everything.

&gt; Even the students, merit based admissions show the top 33% are dominated by overseas students

Prove it. Only [4% of students in higher education in the US are foreigners.](http://www.nacubo.org/Research/Research_News/Number_of_International_Students_in_US_Up_5_Percent.html). That's well below the percentage of the US general population that is foreign.

&gt; If only the Americans were left in americam universities the top 20 universities would all be European or Asian except for 4 IVYs and berkley and Caltech.

If you weren't blinded by bias and on a bullshit campaign right now you'd realize that your argument is nonsensical. If foreigners were responsible for the performance of American universities, and Americans aren't responsible, wouldn't foreign universities be leading instead of American universities? You know, because there's more non-Americans and less Americans to dilute the talent? 

Your argument is just a bunch of mental gymnastics that people like yourself usually depend on to avoid acknowledging facts that refute the anti-American propaganda that you prefer to believe to help cope with your inferiority.

&gt; Now for all your space technology. Pretty much all German. Even to this day over 80% of all wing designs in production originate from WW2 Germany.

Prove it.

&gt; Over half of the work for any space launch in america is due to German research and development.

Prove it. It's funny you even say that, because if Germany was responsible for it all, then Germany would have a better space program than the US, which it doesn't. 

&gt; Dr werner von braun has done more than every American space engineer ever. That is undisputed outside freedom land.

1) The Soviets also had German scientists working in their space program. How often do you see people trying to rob the Soviets of credit by claiming it was due to German expertise by the way? That's called a double-standard.

2) Wernher Von Braun [based his designs on the work of the American](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun#The_Prussian_rocketeer_and_working_under_the_Nazis) who invented liquid-fueled rocketry, [Robert Goddard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Goddard).

*At the time, Germany was highly interested in American physicist Robert H. Goddard's research. Before 1939, German scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions. Wernher von Braun used Goddard's plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the Aggregat (A) series of rockets. The A-4 rocket would become well known as the V-2*

So when Von Braun worked for NASA, all of that came full circle. The US was the origin of modern rocket technology. 

3) There were tens of thousands of scientists, engineers, and technicians involved in the US space program during the space race. Only a handful of them were Germans. The vast majority were and still are US-born, US-educated Americans. NASA is an agency of the US government, [citizenship has always been required for all positions aside from internships.](http://nasajobs.nasa.gov/studentopps/employment/FAQs.htm)

Trying to pretend that NASA's achievements are anyone's but Americans' is flat out stupid. It's indicative of a general insanity that anti-Americans have, in which they must necessarily delude themselves in order to cope with a reality that is too harsh. That reality is that the US leads the world in every field and everyone else plays second fiddle. 

&gt; Even WW2 can be attributed to the US. 

Another example of the inherent insanity of anti-Americanism. You're so deranged by your biases that you're blaming the US for a conflict that every single educated person knows was due to European imperialism. 

&gt; Easily among the least educated

The US has the highest attainment rate of [secondary education](http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/education/high-school-graduation-rate.aspx) and the second highest attainment rate of [university-level education](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/090908/t090908b1-eng.htm) in the OECD. 

Literally every single thing you've said so far has been wrong. It's incredible. You are a brainwashed monkey, a common trait among anti-Americans. Your entire world view is a gigantic load of nonsense that you depend on to shield you from the truth, that you're inferior to and dependent on the US.

Go cry about it you mental midget.

&gt; Now I'm not saying they're not used outside the US or that they aren't useful and innovate in their own way but their fundamental staying power comes from American ineptitude

If you weren't completely brainwashed out of your gourd you'd realize that everything you say just makes you look like a complete imbecile and someone whose world view is fundamentally dishonest and based on jealousy and bitterness. You can't even reasonable deal with the fact that the US leads the world in IT. You have to salvage your views by saying that the US leads the world in providing internet services because of ""ineptitude"". If the US is inept, then your country is a backwards, technological shithole by contrast. Why doesn't your country have lots of competing services for people who aren't ""intept""? You won't be able to explain yourself, because you're just on autopilot right now, spewing a bunch of bullshit in any way you can that will allow you to obfuscate the issues being discussed and help you hold on tightly to your hilariously undeserved sense of superiority over a country and a people who are vastly superior to you in reality.

Seriously, people like you scare me. You don't operate like a normal human being. Your political biases turn you into someone who thinks and functions like someone who has been given a botched lobotomy or something. You're a mindless drone.

&gt; Let me tell you how the rest of the first world feels about you

Rather, what the portion of the first world who is as irredeemably fucktarded as you feels about the US. The US is the most powerful and most advanced nation on the planet, this makes a lot of people in inferior countries feel the need to single out the US in order to cope with their inferiority. You're a perfect example of this pathology in practice. Every single thing you've said so far has been false. How does it feel to depend on lies as the foundation of your world view?

But before Northern Ireland can change as country we all need to change individually. I write this as neither a Unionist or a Nationalist but a humanist. ",0,1415600200,null,0,false,0,cly71pk,t3_2ls460,t1_cly71pk,t3_2ls460,null,1426100405,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

Then the final ""big bang"" episode of the season hits, and it's crap. For whatever reason, you feel let down. You feel cheated and used.

For teams who depend deep, we have to play Gerrard, but for teams who are better than us, we have to play Lucas to break play. If you can't break play, you are just gonna chase the game then. 


When we have 2 strikers on the pitch in the form of Sturridge and Balotelli, it makes sense to play Lucas as we have more creativity on the field even without Gerrard. At around 60-65 min, substitute him for Coutinho to take control of the game. 

When we don't have 2 strikers, it's obvious that Gerrard should not play as sole DM, it should be Lucas. 

Either ways, i think one of Gerrard or Henderson should start. Considering Gerrard has not got the legs, it should be Henderson. But Gerrard should be substituted. He is way more of an influence on the team. 

In the video, he manages to track back most of the times. However, as a DM he should be in front of the loose ball. A DM chases the ball and breaks. Gerrard is essentially playing as a CM at the moment. 

You need you defensive midfielders to stop the cut-backs and through passes. You need your DM's to foul opposition creative players/number 10's. Gerrard tries to do that to the best of his ability.

This season has been blessing; no epic speeches, no overuse of the sonic, no doe eyed girl pining after him.

Russia killed the most Germans and suffered the most casualties, but in the full spectrum of the conflict the US was the single largest contributor to allied victory. The US was the only country to fight signifcantly in every theater of war, the US was the only country to fight two simultaneous regional campaigns on opposite sides of the globe, and the US provided not only its own gigantic military but also the rest of the allies' militaries with the majority of their war material.

&gt; Switzerland is ranked no.1 for global innovation. The United States is 6th
It is quite clear who is lying to themselves here, it isn't even close.

My link says the US is #1. Either way, the US ranks very high, which is remarkable considering the study you linked to tends to favor smaller countries. 

&gt; US ranks 15th in Literacy

Not surprising considering the fact the US has 12 million illegal immigrants from Mexico. The fact that the US performs as well as it does is impressive considering the fact the US as by far the highest rate of minorities and illegal immigrants out of any developed country. 

&gt; US ranks 29th in quality of healthcare system index

That's the WHO. There is only one aspect of the WHO ranking, that has the lowest weight in the overall score, that actually compares healthcare quality called, it's ""Responsiveness"". [The US is #1 in that category](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704130904574644230678102274?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052748704130904574644230678102274.html), but goes down the list because ""fairness"" is the most weighted aspect. That means a country where EVERYONE has shitty healthcare will potentially score higher than the US simply because there's only one tier of healthcare. So say everyone in the US has better quality care than the other country, but some Americans have mediocre healthcare and some have excellent care. The US will get less points simply because the standard of care is not uniform.

&gt; US ranks 1st for incarcerations

Another result of circumstance. The US has the highest rate of minorities and illegal immigrants in the developed world. The US both has a demographics-driven high rate of crime, while also having the economic means and the criminal law establishment to arrest, try, and imprison people. Many other countries would have higher rates of incarceration if they had the ability to actually find and imprison criminals, or had similar demographics to the US. 

Fun fact: [More black people jailed in England and Wales proportionally than in US.](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/oct/11/black-prison-population-increase-england)

Imagine if blacks were 15% of the population in England and Wales instead of 3%. The UK would have a much higher rate of incarceration than it does now, even if nothing about the system changed.

Tennant's Doctor, Smith's Doctor... every doctor, new and old, has done something at least somewhat morally reprehensible. But Smith and Tennant had very clear policies on weapons and on killing innocents. Capaldi is willing to throw away a life if it benefits him and the larger scheme.

I think those policies are probably what kept the identities of the last two doctors in check. They could think they were basically good specifically because they held ideals on the value of a human life, even if they contradicted those ideals at times. Capaldi's Doctor does not have that anymore. That's likely why he wonders whether or not he's a good person.

I think you're partly right. It was his war remorse that upheld a lot of his framework. But I don't know if you can undo the war remorse, even by going back in time and stopping it from happening, because whether he unwrote it or not, it still happened, and the Doctor still remembers it. It's not the effect of the situation, but the decision and the situation itself, that would cause the most guilt. I think it could have made him more morally ambiguous, but the fault all historians know not to make regarding cause and effect is to link one effect to one cause.

* Movable-type printing. It marked the beginning of the age of enlightenment.

That's an exaggeration.

It's the first of six centres to be opened and it's run by British Army medics and partly run by a British charity, Save The Children. That is a lot of British people volunteering to fight Ebola. Considering USA has a much larger population than the UK and most EU countries, the number of British volunteers is noteworthy. It's unfair to undermine *anyone's* effort towards this cause.

What swells my soul with happiness is the bits reminiscent of the Tom Baker.

I liked this season's character-driven arc a lot. Some people have complained that the series/season became too Clara-centric but I think in retrospect it is clear that her development as a character and companion was a reflection of the Doctor.

I find this hard to explain, but the yearning and frustration I felt at the end of the episode actually makes me see the shift in the storytelling of doctor who. Moffat and Capaldi left us a gritty ending that really shows the depth of emotion the show is headed in, finally, after hundreds of years the doctor is ""breaking-down"" the stress the responsibility, the anger at being amazing, yet impossible to affect that which he desires most is finally reveals itself in a very real and relatable human way.

This is simply false. It doesn't exist to exclude Catholics, if that was the case it would let everyone else in, but it doesn't. It's there to promote the reformed Christian faith. No where does it call for complete isolation from members of other faiths.

&gt;If the Orange Order wants to legitimise the Twelfth as a cultural celebration then it needs to celebrate its traditions WITH Catholics. It's a such a simple thing. 

There's no one stopping them. We don't have marshals posted asking people to recite the alphabet. Indeed in years gone by Catholics did come out to watch, and in many country twelfths they still do, although they mightn't go out of their way to do so.

&gt;The leadership of the Orange Order are sectarian bigots with extremist religious agendas, and many young Protestants are going along with it instead of questioning it. 

Who exactly? And how? What is this agenda? 

&gt;I hate to point this out but nationalists/republicans have made much better efforts to include Protestants in their own cultural celebrations. Apart from a few exceptions, Protestant leaders have made little efforts the other way around. 

I'll just leave this here
&gt;&gt;rule 1.2 sets out the basic aim of the GAA very clearly:*The Association is a National Organisation which has as its basic aim the strengthening of the National Identity in a 32 County Ireland through the preservation and promotion of Gaelic Games and pastimes.*
&gt;&gt;In other words, it places the games as a means to an end. That also needs to be taken in the context of rule 2.1 on membership, which states: *Membership of the Association shall be granted only by a Club, to persons who subscribe to and undertake to further the aims and objects of the Gaelic Athletic Association, as stated in the Official Guide.*

&gt;That needs to change. But with schools still segregated and none of the mainstream political parties taking cross-community schooling seriously I have little optimism that this will happen.

false,APeacefulWarrior,null,null,"He's getting this reaction from me because the writing has been so-so since he took over as showrunner and, this season, it's become absolutely terrible.  There were few, if any, episodes in this season that doesn't have massive, glaring plot holes and outright inconsistencies with all logic and known science.

And Moffat has gotten steadily *worse* about simply handwaving those inconsistencies away, or else ignoring them completely.  I mean, FFS, the Doctor specifically (and accurately) points out that an actual medieval Robin Hood could not possibly have perfect teeth... and then we're supposed to believe it's the ""real"" Robin Hood anyway, perfect teeth included?

Like, that's so stupid it's INSULTING.  Why did they even bring the teeth up in the first place?  

The result is a Doctor Who I find absolutely incomprehensible, and that I cannot get ""involved in"" at all.  How can I care about the outcome of an episode when, time and time and time after time, Moffat pulls *complete bullshit* out of his ass to resolve a plot rather than adhering to any known logic?  Why should I care whether the moon-baby lives or dies when it's obvious that through some absolute miracle, the episode is going to end with the Moon right back where it started since any alternative would rip the Earth apart?

And don't even get me started on the magic glowing forest people.
 
Plus, when all the characters are unsympathetic and hard-to-like, why would I give a crap -much less cry- over a neverending goodbye scene between two characters I don't even think loved each other that much in the first place?  (Seriously, no one lies to a person as much as Clara does and *actually* loves them as a partner.)

I feel like someone would have to be drunk or high to enjoy most of this last season, because unless one's brain is 100% locked down, the cascade of poor ideas and terrible plotting destroys any emotional impact the episode might have.

And frankly, if someone *doesn't* care about logic in their stories, and just want to watch people running and screaming until a deus ex machina saves them, perhaps they should be watching Michael Bay movies instead of Who.",0,1415608191,null,0,1415608886,0,cly95gm,t3_2lu2dq,t1_cly95gm,t1_cly7mot,null,1426099422,42,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,42

I did attend a few games at Hampden Park, because they used to give away free tickets to schools (which is how I ended up going) and the stadium wasn't full. 

2. I do know a few people who follow an American football team in the US. They stop up late to watch games, were the appropriate shirts etc... but they all follow either an EPL/SPL or Rugby team first. 

3. I don't know many people who don't follow an EPL/SPL or Rugby (union or league) team. Football (EPL/SPL) is a religion - certainly round here, I don't know anyone who feels that strongly (here) about an American football team (I know a few Americans who do, but...)

4. It's not just top flight football here that gets the following. Locally, we have a non-league team which gets regularly packed out attendances locally (I know a few people who actually travel for away matches too). Although all of the people who follow our local non-league side also follow a top flight team. Last week, a non-league side from the next town over, made it through the 1st round of the FA cup, beating a league side which was the equivalent of 100 league places above them &amp; an awful lot of local people (including people who don't normally follow football) got awfully excited about it. It was more impressive because the team are from a town where Rugby League is King - top flight League side play locally, and they *really* draw the crowds.

Obviously, this is just in my experience. My experience may be biased because I live in the North West of England where it is often argued, we have the highest density of top EPL sides, and a glut of top flight Rugby League sides too, and every single town in the local area, no matter how deprived, has a cricket club.",0,1415608245,null,0,false,0,cly95v5,t3_2lscy6,t1_cly95v5,t3_2lscy6,null,1426099418,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

He's picked a completely ineffective captain, who anyone who payed any attention to us last year would know is really not up to the job.

Obviously there's a lot of those with Irish heritage that went over around the time of the Potato Famine (which was a similarly massive disaster).

But, I think we can all agree that the Wars of the Three Kingdoms are a bit two adrift in terms of years to really have that great an affect on modern Britain, and that's with a much greater proportional loss of life - I'll concede that with it only being 150 years or so since the US Civil War there are still after effects, but they're smaller than the socio-economic aftershocks of either world war (never mind the combination of the two); this is more or less purely because of the time span involved. From a societal point of view, WW1 has pretty much faded (though economic affects, due to the fact that it seems like everyone somehow owed the US about four times their national wealth, are going to linger for some time), this is because just about everyone who was witness to it has died, and whilst a large part of the ""WW2 generation"" is still alive.

(On a side note, it's interesting how people always seem to view WW1 as having caused a higher loss of life, but when you look at the numbers WW1 killed a maximum of 1.9% of the global population, whilst WW2 killed a minimum of 3%.

The trouble is that I'm not reaching that conclusion [without reason](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/17/parliament-too-alcohol-fuelled-say-mps) (and that's *in* Parliament!) 

A few years ago I wrote to my then local MP - Peter Bottomley who has enjoyed a safe conservative seat in Worthing for some time - on the topic of internet neutrality and the importance of ensuring it was handled correctly. 

He replied saying he would not be attending Parliament on the issue - not because he was busy - but because it didn't represent the interests of his constituents. 

As one of his constituents that brought home to me his disinterest in even trying to convince me that he was doing the right thing. His response was short and didn't detail what was drawing his time that was more valuable. 

If I can't count on my local MP to represent my interests and can see quite easily that he isn't going to be easily challenged for his seat in the area (Worthing - for instance - has remained heavily Conservative for some time) then why should I believe my interests are at heart? 

But if he can find time to show up for 'banter' at PMQ's then I guess that's OK. Seems /r/unitedkingdom - going by some of the comments - would rather have banter than boring but fighting for our best interests.

The point is though that there is room for debate here, so it needs to be debated. You can't have a debate if you want to silence everyone that has the opposite opinion. That's the trick they pulled with the ""if you're not with us you're against us an unpatriotic"" anti-terrorism legislation.

The age of consent is a pretty crappy way of doing things, it's applying a one size fits all to something with a really high degree of variability. We use it because the alternatives are either impractical or require us to trust in adults judgment (yeah right!). If (pulling numbers out of my arse) 50% of 16 years have the skills needed, then maybe 30% of 15 year olds so, 10% of 14 year olds, 1% of 13 year olds, etc.

9th: The veterian. Fresh off the time war he's looking to leave behind what he had to do. He's angry and hurt but he really loves humanity.

10th: He's become a hero. Reveling in being clever and helping people. He's always looking for the next adventure. The next problem. He really enjoys it when he is the one to save the day.

11th: A mad man, a wizard. He's a huge showoff and just wants to enjoy the beauty and wonder of the galaxy. Trouble unfortunately follows wherever he goes. But if there is one thing he loves to do, he loves to bend the rules to make himself look that much more awesome.

12: It's too early to describe 12 fully but to get to him we'll have to talk more about 11.

While the 11th doctor had a lot of fun, his entire life was spent being hunted. Ultimately he fought battle after battle and in the end used his regeneration energy as a weapon to fend off his enemies.

So 12 is a realist. He says he picked this face for a reason. To tell him something. His angry cross face that is good at yelling. Because 11 lost his best friend's daughter and then his 2 best friends themselves. He let his enemies run wild and get too far. So now he had to tell himself. Don't let that happen. You had too much fun, and it was nice. But now it's time to be serious.

And that is 12. A serious doctor who is a realist. The wonder of the galaxy is taking a back seat. Like I said. I'm hoping for better next series for 12.

We don't have a 70k seat stadium or sugar daddy owner so we can't attract established world class players like Sanchez. We are not a small club like Leicester who can always play the underdog.

It's not a time for the self, or ego, but for the community to come together to mourn and remember those who died fighting for it. Whether or not you agree with war or not, it's just common decency not to disrupt that - like I say, it's the only day of the year put aside for this.

Okay, that's me being facetious, but it's actually incredibly frustrating to know how much dental caries could be prevented by such a simple measure. In Scotland fluoridation has been shelved due to one of the longest court cases in our history where 'granny McColl' argued that she shouldn't have to ingest fluoride because she had no teeth. 

Because of this, we have one of the highest rates of dentally diseased children worldwide - children less than 4 regularly need general anaesthetics to have most or all of their teeth removed. Yes, their parents should give them a better diet and brush their teeth more, but why should they have to suffer for their parents actions?

Why not? He sucked too, and all Moffatt is done is take the same lame RTD formula and run it into the ground.

Avoid the fallacy of false equivalence.

&gt;but one gets a lotttttt more hate than the other.

false,JamJarre,cnty-uk,Liverpewl,"Basically, 90% of work in Parliament takes place outside of the chamber, in various committees. They're often run by backbench MPs and are designed to hold the Government to account as well as develop and refine legislation. In the whole life cycle of a bill, the whole House will only meet a couple of times - the main one is the second reading where the principles of the law are discussed, but there can be others afterwards if the bill is particularly contentious.

The Commons itself is generally used to amend and then approve laws, but the vast majority of the legislative work happens off-stage, so to speak.

The reason that general debates (like the recent one on drugs policy) don't get many attendees is because they're not discussing any specific law. They're just general blue sky thinking about various issues. So while people love to pile on and point to the lack of MPs attending these, the reality is that the reason MPs aren't there will either be due to constituency commitments, or because they're actually in committee doing legislative work at the same time. If, rather than a general discussion on UK drug policy, that debate was on a specific bill (let's say the Drugs Are Fun Let's Legalise Them Bill, 2014) then the House would be packed to the rafters. The Whips would demand attendance and there would likely be a spirited debate about the text and spirit of the proposed law.

PMQs is pretty much the only time the whole House gets together. It's like at school when your class all gets together for registration and then goes their separate ways to various subject classes - the atmosphere is a little more relaxed and they can feel part of a *party* again, before heading off and putting on their committee or constituency hats. So it may appear that nobody cares but in actual fact while the *chamber* may be empty for important matters,  the *committee rooms* are full.

As for whether the people who show up to these are good or bad MPs, it's hard to tell. Perhaps they're due in Parliament for important bill discussions or committee appearances and just have free time inbetween, perhaps their constituency isn't a particularly busy one, perhaps it's of particular interest to them. A good MP has to balance their work in Parliament with time in their constituency, which doesn't leave a whole lot of time for abstract debating.

Also worth bearing in mind is that government ministers don't have the same free time as regular MPs - most work 10-12 hour days at Civil Service departments, so it's always going to be unlikely that they would be able to get away to discuss drugs policy (again, for example). You can bet that Theresa May cares about UK drug policy, but she's not going to tear herself away from running one of the biggest departments of state to hear a few MPs chatting informally about where they think the policy should go - she'll only show up in the chamber when they're actually debating her proposed legislative changes.

TL;DR - PMQs is a short session and pretty much the only time that Parliament gets together other than at readings of contentious, important bills. 90% of what they do happens off-screen in Committee and is as serious and sober as you'd hope ",0,1415614924,null,0,false,0,clyaekj,t3_2lsy3p,t1_clyaekj,t1_clya8e4,null,1426098839,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

The fragility of the Police's ability to respond to anything because they had to throw more resources at the highlighted area.

The fact that they had to do that with a £33M budget cut?

There's pops below about Yes men and such. But what would any of us do if faced with those choices?

I wondered if Policing by ballot - ""Tweet now if you think we should send officers to X Y or Z"" would be any kind of option.

It did highlight the very tough job the investigating teams have with these things - which because of the legal system can mean all of the work comes to nothing.

How many of us would put so much of a bulging case-load of work (at the cost of other work) into something we were at least concerned maybe little better than 50/50?

There was something of an admission that they'd at least contributed to the problem with their approach in the days of the gravy, ""So you don't want to make a complaint? Oh. OK then, case closed.""

Is it any wonder a culture of grooming with a belief that they were untouchable emerged.

Scare the child enough or groom them sufficiently, both were mentioned on the programme, and the victim would not press charges.

Having worked with some Pakistani guys on a national multi-stop operation, something struck me from this.

There were no travel expenses on offer, the guys said they would be fine going to city X, Y and Z as they had people they could stay with.

Raise interest rates slightly, while it may cause harm the current borrowing levels are simply leading us to another housing market crisis. Make policy that makes it unattractive to do buy to let and renting on a large scale, say greater than 5 houses. Renting should not be a long term business option. 

Bring some living wage into effect and lower VAT, poor people are the willing to spend money and fuel growth. 

Create rules for new housing that it must be offered to UK buyers before overseas, also remove right to buy on council houses our councils need money and we need to stop selling assets.

Stop selling assets, I am yet to see the rich sell assets that make or save them money, but they seem to insist that our country won't need them. 

Increase tax on products that are well known to cause harm to people but lobbying protects them. Energy drinks and general high sugar i'm looking at you. - simply for lower dental costs not the increased revenue.

Overall I am honestly not sure, it is without doubt a hard challenge I think what I would prefer to do the most is have grown up discussions using facts and figures, long term plans, honesty and openness. If people don't understand the difference between deficit and debt then explain it rather that use it for PR purposes. Frankly our political system is too much of a joke to get anywhere, till that is fixed I doubt anything else will be.

false,redrambler13,null,null,"Brendan Rodgers insists that Liverpool’s transfer policy will pay dividends and claimed it had been necessary to sign players of potential because established stars are reluctant to move to Merseyside.

Having said at the end of last season that he “would rather have one or two absolute top players than seven who might not help us”, Rodgers ended up making nine signings after Luis Suárez’s departure to Barcelona and the change in strategy is yet to yield results.

Rodgers continues to cite Alexis Sánchez’s preference to live in London as symbolic of Liverpool’s struggle to attract top-class talent, having also missed out on Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Willian, Diego Costa and Yevhen Konoplyanka in the past 18 months.

But Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Lazar Markovic were first-choice targets signed at great expense, a combined total of £69 million, and with none of the quartet yet to make a positive impression along with “calculated gamble” Mario Balotelli, Rodgers has again been forced to defend Liverpool’s work in the transfer market.

“We have signed talented young players,” Rodgers said. “Over their time here, whether it is with me or not, they will show they are very good players. We know what targets we wanted but, for one reason or another, they went elsewhere. We work with what we have got and we hope to improve it and get back to the level that we have shown over 18 months.

“We were in a great position at the end of last season. We had Champions League football and a way of working. We just have to work harder to convince these players to come. The club has done everything they could over the course of the summer to get the players to come here.

“In football terms, players look for more than that. They look for social factors, where they want to live. We can’t control that. If someone gets offered, say, more money to come here than elsewhere but they want to go to London, there is not much you can do about that.”

Asked why Chelsea had progressed while Liverpool have regressed, José Mourinho refused to discuss his vanquished opponents, but his answer still illuminated their failings. “I don’t speak about them, I speak about us,” the Chelsea manager said. “We are a better team. We got players to improve the team, not the squad, because sometimes you get players to improve the squad and other times you get players to improve the team. We got players to improve the team.”

Rodgers said: “They have a strong, experienced squad and have added quality to it in the summer. They have shown a big level of consistency since the beginning of the season and that is something we haven’t shown.”

Death in Heaven is like a perfect microcosm for this; how did the Master escape Gallifrey? Not explained. How did she get control of the cybermen? Not explained, which I was extra dissatisfied with because it meant the cybermen were just nondescript alien of the week conflict when they can and have been so much more interesting than that, in fact it's kind of exactly what he did with the daleks in Asylum of the Daleks. You know for an enormous Old Who fan Moffat's really terrible at writing the classic monsters. Where's the cyberplanner? Not explained, you could have that AI interface be the cyberplanner and he could have been a really cool second tier villain, but no, just some throw away character whose only purpose was exposition. 

Then he kills off that scientist lady on her second episode, again, just a waste of a character you could do so much more with, both in the rest of the series and in the episode. Really the whole UNIT storyline had nothing to do with anything, it was just a way to throw in a Brigadier reference, which I don't object to on principle but again it's just so poorly thought out. 

It gets to feel like Moffat just doesn't have respect for us as an audience, I mean, he's not even trying to have any kind of coherence between stories. Neil Gaiman left that piece of Cyberman floating in space after Nightmare in Silver for a reason, it was to give the next writer that wrote a cybermen story something to grasp at so they could explain how the cybermen were still alive. Anyone with the slightest hint of an imagination could think up some kind of explanation to connect that and this and it would take a minute at most to explain it in the script, but he just didn't. 

Same with how Missy got out of Gallifrey, he just didn't care, so he kills off characters pointlessly before they've had any chance to develop beyond ""Is a fan of the Doctor, can science, and has asthma.""  

Moff knows how to write an emotional scene, he's pretty good at dialogue (Although sometimes even that falls on it's arse), he knows how to set up a season arc, and he knows how to be scary, but there's so much other stuff that needs to be on point that he seems to just be allergic to or something. 

Maybe people sometimes don't give him enough credit, but if he wasn't doing anything wrong people like me wouldn't be able to point out problems and complain about them and I think that's the key thing, if you can point out a problem and explain why it's a problem then I think we all have to admit that that means there is a problem, and just dismissing what's in front of you because it feels excessive is not a smart way to look at this stuff, in my humble opinion.

[The Excel model used here](http://www.reform.co.uk/content/5031/research/economy/reality_check_fixing_the_uks_tax_system#taxcalc) says that cost a few billion as would most of the economic papers I read at university about tax.


&gt;Make actual attempts to get people back into stable, fairly paid employment by ending workfare and letting people think about what they actually want to do

It's a bit more difficult than that but lets presume you can simply help people into work with no additional cost at all. [Spare capacity in the UK is about 1%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28768450), so if we suddenly reached full employment then the economy would be 1% larger and still have a big deficit.


&gt;I'd raise the minimum wage to a living wage to increase the buying power of the working class 

The minimum wage is calculated to be the highest it can without affecting employment. If employment stayed the same then it would save £5 billion. Lets presume that. So so far you've saved either -£1.8 billion or £12.5 billion depending on how optimistic you are...

&gt;reduce VAT to 15% to do the same

I say this because there were some episodes I really really enjoyed in this season, Robot of Sherwood was actually one of them but that's mainly because the Doctor and Robin's ego war was hysterical to me. I thoroughly enjoyed Time Heist, I did notice a plot hole when I rewatched it (Why didn't The Teller just eat the Doc and Clara's brains when he caught them in the vault?) but it was pretty solid in every other respect, and the characters had good motivation, explored adequately enough to have the plot make sense and make me care about them, and the whole thing was an actual time travel heist which was very cool, made sense, and had a satisfying ending that made sense. And the other two I really liked were Mummy on the Orient Express and Flatline, which were just well paced, cool concepts with interesting characters that moved the story along and plot resolutions that made sense and were satisfying, with the right amounts of fun, darkness, sci-fi and humanity thrown in. 

So yeah, although there was a fair amount of absolute shit in this season (I don't think it ever got worse than Kill the Moon and I don't think it will for a while) it was punctuated by some really good stuff. I feel like the main thing to complain about is Moffat's contributions, because he seems to get the same shit wrong over and over, with turds like Kill the Moon we can just pretend they never happened and hope nobody is dumb enough to hire that writer again, but Moffat seems to be planning to stay forever, so his is the stuff we've got to try and fix.",0,1415617876,null,0,false,0,clyaxai,t3_2lu2dq,t1_clyaxai,t1_cly95gm,null,1426098584,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"Just to elaborate on /u/safaridiscoclub 's comment:

Every week ministers are expect to be in the House of Commons to answer questions from MPs. MP's submit their question in advance and may get a written response in return or a verbal response on the day. They may then ask a follow up question that is related to the first question (this is important) and they get a response to that too.

When asking in person, you get a question, a response, a follow up question, and then a final response.

When you're asking a question to the Minister for European Fisheries there isn't really much demand so you can submit a question whenever you want and get it answered. With the Prime Minister though it's super popular so you have to enter a ballot, and people are chosen at random to ask the question.

At some point someone figured out giving the PM time to research all the questions he gets asked gives him a huge advantage, so they submitted the question ""Could the Prime Minister please list his engagements and meetings for today?"".

This is genius because you can ask any followup question you want on the back of it:

""I am glad to see the PM is consulting on the subject of...""

""Why is the PM not looking at...""

""I hope the PM has time to consider the impact of...""

The PM used to have to stand up and say the answer ""Today I will be holding meetings with my cabinet colleagues..."" etc before EVERY question because every question was the same, it was the follow up question that is different.

So in theory it's a Q&amp;A session where everyone has asked the PM what he is doing today, followed by a question of their own choosing. The opposition leader gets 6 questions (it used to be 4 to the opposition and 2 to the Lib Dems but not the Lib Dems are in government) and the rest are the MPs select by a ballot.

If you watch any other ministers field questions you'll see the MP stand up and say ""Number 12 Mister Speaker"" or whatever, in which case the Minister will answer that, and then the followup. In PMQs only the first person does that, then it's assumed everyone else answered the same.

Occasionally though you will get someone submit a question in writing. It throws everyone off when that happens.",0,1415619370,null,0,false,0,clyb6xr,t3_2lsy3p,t1_clyb6xr,t1_cly61e8,null,1426098458,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

However, try buying them in bulk at the start of the month, it seems a lot to pay out, but it does work out cheaper, then limit yourself. Seriously, you have to limit yourself, otherwise, because they're in, you'll just go through them and be skint and fagless by the end of the month.

Obviously, other people have already told you to buy cheaper cigarettes/roll your own/quit. This advice is good advice. So good luck with those.

Regards food. Are you on facebook? If so, use the search thing and look for 'ways to feed your family for £20 a week'. they come up with some reasonable recipe ideas.

Also, try [A Girl Called Jack](http://agirlcalledjack.com/). Some of those recipes are very very good, and she had no choice but to make healthy and nutritious meals cheaply.

Try cooking in bulk. Ingredients don't come in handy portion sizes for 1, or sometimes even 2 people or meals, and wasting the rest of a jar is costing you money that you don't have - so if you're making food, make as much as you have the ingredients for, so instead of a portion for 1, make enough for 4, or even 8. Save plastic takeaway containers (although you really shouldn't be eating takeaways) or buy some really cheap plastic tubs (pound shops/bargain shops/even amazon) and portion the food up, then freeze it. You don't have to have chilli every night for a week. Make a batch and have a portion once a week for the month.

Carbs - very filling, with slow release energy. Also tend to be cheap. Potatoes, rice, pasta... buy lots and add them to everything. Also, don't buy oven chips, buy actual potatoes. You can make chips with some cheap oil (you can make healthy-ish ones by peeling the spuds, chopping into chips, laying on a baking tray and spraying with a little bit of oil then baking, or just deep fry them in an ordinary pan with a few inches of the cheapest oil that you can buy. After use, strain the oil to get rid of bits and put it back in the bottle - you can usually reuse it a few times before it has to be chucked out.) Or you can have a jacket potato (pretty filling, relatively healthy), mash, even dauphinoise if you fancy it.

Do you have a friend in a similar situation that you could share food shopping with? If you shop in bulk you often get things cheaper, then split the food, the cost, and the savings between you?

Finally, this is going to sound harsh, but meat is expensive. If you can, try going veggie a few days a week. Not everyone can/wants to, but it is cheaper. Then, when you are buying meat, you can have a look for deals at the start of the month, buy it in bulk and freeze it. Personally, I find most meat replacement products quite expensive and I don't like the taste of them, so try other types of vegetarian food. Mushrooms and nuts are usually pretty good.

For the Scottish Parliament, we elect most MSPs with FPTP in single-member constituencies, and then have regional top-up MSPs which are elected from party lists using d'Hondt.

For Westminster, we elect MPs from single-member constituencies using FPTP.

false,TheAngryPuffin,null,null,"I emigrated four years ago and it was honestly the best thing I could have done. Of the 100+ people from my school year, a rough summary would be 80% of them also having emigrated (all sorts of jobs and vocations). I worked in N.I. for approx. 5 years post-graduation, before leaving, and to be honest the sheer amount of fuck-wittery and lazy bastards moaning combined with the hilarious attempt at equality and HR brain-farting I witnessed, left me seriously worried for N.I.   

I'm very proud to tell people that I meet in Germany that I'm from Northern Ireland (I'm a taig... go figure lol!) and I make a clear distinction (when explaining) from my RoI mates. Everyone I've met the emigrated has said that everything just got better as soon as they left home, like there was some kind of stagnating atmosphere previously.

I tried to contribute as much as I could to changing things back home, through my job and day-to-day interactions with people. Sometimes you really do want to choke some of the cunts as you see them just wrecking things... not always physical objects but just being intimidating in their herds during whatever particular 'cultural' event is being celebrated (that goes for both sides, I had some moron hit me with a hurl once though he did get to experience City A&amp;E long before it closed). 

And you can see the change in the kids. One year I met my mates kid and he though I was the best, running around and playing football... next time I see him I explain that I don't play flute as I'm not very musically inclined and he asks ""do fenians not play flutes?""... wtf? He's probably only stopped having his arse wiped for him and he's coming out with this. And his immediate family aren't the ones doing this, to the best of my knowledge.

My plan is to offer whatever help I can if schools/groups want to come to Germany for trips or whatever, or do the odd careers talk when I'm home visiting (best experience ever, I'm still getting emails asking about my particular job experience and travelling, etc.). That's the only way I can help as fuck going back on a long term basis. I'll stick to my epic Teutonic healthcare and non-sectarian sports events (i.e. we have turkish kids starting to play hurling... dunno if the GAA would be too pleased lol!... and I've delved into the allegedly Protestant related field hockey which is a mental sport...

Check bearings for wear

Any dealer worth their salt will be able to service any bike. However, I would go for a dealer that sells Japanese bikes for anything from the big four, anything else you're best going to a delaer that specialises in that type of bike (i.e don't take your Ducati to a harley dealership)

If you really need a service log book, then you can probably get one off ebay. do you need one for the added resale value? Probably not, as long as you've kept receipts from all the services.

My point is that it is perfectly possible to have a good quality lifestyle on minimum wage, that most people I meet appear not to know how to accomplish this (you don't *need* a 60 inch TV... especially not on credit), and that until you have reasonably tried to do so you have no right to complain. 

I do understand and sympathise with those who have more than a handful of children, or those that have other financial responsibilities, but for the average three person family I really don't understand how it isn't possible.

Your children don't need the latest mobile phone on contract, you don't need a hugely expensive car, nor a city townhouse. It's perfectly possible to clean on a budget of, say, £20 a month, and adequate food can be purchased for a small price, too. It's perfectly reasonable to build your child an inexpensive PC, or to have one family computer (although this is sometimes difficult, I understand), one can find a decently sized CRT TV for free on the likes of freecycle... you get my drift.

I managed to build a pretty damned good PC for less than £100 all included, and it outperforms quite a substantial number of modern computers. I bought my missus an old laptop, and upgraded it with a slightly beefier processor. I furnished our home with second-hand or refurbished appliances that cost me much less than new, and they are still reliable and effective. 

I know this is an unpopular opinion, and that many will disagree with me on this, but I think we have some way to go before inflation makes life truly impossible on minimum wage.

Pretty much wanted to stop reading after the above sentence. Southampton had a great start to the 2013/14 season as well, granted with far fewer changes to their personel. Yes they are a team that was dubbed to be ""in transition"" this season. Consequently they changed a bit part of their team. However you are missing out on some key points here:
-They are not expected to challenge for the title or a top four position

-The players they brought into their squad were seen as a bit of a gamble

-It took a coach with an almost intimate knowledge of these players to bring them to the club (Koeman knows the Dutch league very well, so he knew better than most manager about what the likes of Tadić, Pelle and Alderweireld can offer to a team and how to best employ their talents)

-As a consequence of all of these factors nobody really knew what to expect from Southampton as a football team

-Southampton's season could've been the complete opposite of the success story it has been up to this point

Yes they are outperforming us right now. We are not done with the first third of the season yet. Sure the PL title is way out of reach but we can still build upon the success of the 2013-14 season by finishing in the top 4 and preparing for the future with another year in the Champions League, strengthening the team and improving the one we have right now.

Things are not great. But we haven't really disintegrated as a club or a team. Had we managed to score another goal against Everton or Hull we would have had 4 points more on the board right now.

1: We suffered from over-expectation this season due to us getting 2nd last season, so that's where the frustrations have begun when people are expecting us to make a title winning run.

2: In regards to Rodgers being clueless, we fielded a B team against Madrid considering our priority should be maintaining a spot in Europe next season, unfortunately we were unable to get anything from the Chelsea game, even though we deserved a point and didn't get a penalty call from that Cahill handball.

3: Not changing things? We have the most tactically diverse manager in the league right now. We've tried the 5-3-2, 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1, and 4-4-2 Diamond throughout his Liverpool managing career. He gave up his possession-based philosophy from last season and employed one of the most attack oriented squads to deadly effect last season.

4: He can't be solely at fault for his transfers over the summer. We were meaning to keep Suarez at least for another year and build the squad around him. Unfortunately, some of the transfers haven't performed as best as they could, but we have to remember that some of these players are getting used to the physicality and pace of the premier league. Can and Lallana has looked fairly good for us so far and we have yet to even see Origi come in for us. Not to mention, we were trying to attract Alexis Sanchez over the summer, but lost out to Arsenal; and so far this season, he resembles a certain Uruguayan that left over the summer.

There has been one thing consistent across our last 3 managers from AVB to Sherwood to Poch there seems to have been a consistent drop in the mentality of the players and at some point people start doing the math and seeing that regardless of who is calling the shots the attitude isn't changing. 

Levy actually sounds like he is trying to react to this.....just the other week there was a news story where Levy (and presumably Broomfield) wanted to reshape the scouting of the club with an emphasis of putting eyes onto the players we are identifying through other routes.  By getting eyes on the players that seems to be an indication that we want some insight into the player's mentality since that is the one thing you cannot get without someone being near the player.

At this point i think the approach is to actually address the issues with the players and not just sack another manager. I think we may be seeing a fairly large clearout over the next couple of windows as they try to clear out the shit attitudes that have impacted the club for the past couple years.

&gt; But seriously, an MP absolutely needs to take corporate interests into account. If an employer is responsible for the livelihood of 5,000 of his constituents, of course an MP is going to advocate in their interest over a handful of opposing constituents.

I can appreciate that as long as there's some transparency. I'm not a child - I'm a voter of voting age and in theory they want my vote, right? What better way to get it than to explain things to me (or have someone else do it on their behalf - I don't care if I get an admin assistance explaining this). 

But *don't* give me a short letter saying ""I don't think it's in my constituents interests to appear and vote on this issue"". That's obtuse enough to make me think the man doesn't care at all - and given Worthing is hardly a technology hub - many constituents won't understand it *but he will still need to*. 

Give me information and reasons. Get someone else to do it. Don't hide behind a smokescreen of intangible 'best interests of my constitutents'.

I appreciate hundreds must get in touch with their MP about everything that *they* feel is important - but if that MP can't directly reply to each one then get someone to help with that.

No? Because that isn't what I said at all. You just said that it only works when applied topically, and I'm pointing out that this is irrelevant because by drinking water you are applying fluoride topically...  And at any rate, surely you can tell the difference between the amount of fluoride in mouthwash and the amount of fluoride in water.

&gt; So if I drink a pretty sizeable amount of water the amount of fluoride consumed would be equally sizeable... No?

That's not how it works. The recommended amounts are about the safe values based on the amount of water a person drinks. 1-4mg/L is considered potentially unsafe.  0.5-1.0mg/L (1.2mg/L in some sources) is considered to be safe, the recommended amount by various organisations is around 0.75mg/L. At 1mg/L and above there is a risk of cosmetic defects (white spots on teeth). At 2mg/L it becomes potentially dangerous.

The estimated amount of fluoride needed to be ingested to cause gastrointestinal discomfort is around 3-4mg. But let's be honest, if you are going to be drinking 4 litres of water in a 2 hour period, you are probably going to have some gastrointestinal discomfort anyway...

&gt; I simply cannot see the issue with letting people be responsible for their own dental hygiene. If you can please enlighten me.

That aside, this is simply how Microsoft works. 

The reason MS products are everywhere is that they pay big money to have Windows shipped on every new computer, and they consistently develop their own, proprietary standards and make compatibility harder than it ought to be. 

Office is a case in point. Up until recent versions, the Open Document format has only been usable by way of a plugin. You haven't been able to use ODF files natively in MS Office unless you installed extra software, while the completely free rival Office suite, OpenOffice, boasted total compatibility with MS formats and used ODF as standard.

I gave up using MS products many years ago now, and I honestly am happier for the decision. My computer is faster, more secure and easier to use and fix than any version of Windows will ever be.

I wouldn't stop the right to buy scheme altogether, but I would change the rules to make it less profitable to abuse the right to buy scheme.

https://www.gov.uk/right-to-buy-buying-your-council-home/selling-your-home

&gt; You’ll have to pay back some or all of the discount you got if you sell your Right to Buy home within 5 years of buying it.

I would change it so that if you sell the house within the first 15 years, you have to offer it back to the council first at the price you paid for it, plus inflation amount agreed upon by both parties, or another social housing landlord in the area, with having to pay back the **full discount** if you sell within the first 10 years.

Having to pay back the whole discount with the first 10 years would massively discourage those who buy a property at a discount to sell at the earliest available opportunity.

As it stands, you can buy up a property at a nice discount and sell it in 4 years time and only have to pay back 20% of that discount. This 20% will often be easily covered by the profit you got from the previous 80% off and any inflation that upped the price over the 4 years.

The right to buy scheme was supposed to help the poor get on the property ladder and reduce expenses for local councils. What it has achieved is people selling out as quickly as possible to large companies, and a shortage of homes in the area forcing up property prices for everyone.

A perfect example of this is the housing situation in London where large investment companies are buying up properties and not even renting them out. They're simply holding on to properties and pushing up housing prices by creating a lack of supply. They're essentially treating homes as stocks; artificially inflating the prices by buying up as many as possible.",0,1415622308,null,0,false,0,clybsh0,t3_2luh2d,t1_clybsh0,t1_clyalk1,null,1426098123,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

They need to spend the entire window spending on defensive players to be honest.
Arsenal aren't good enough for Reus. Our main threats are PSG, Juve, kind of Real, and City.

2) Reus is that good. You don't watch him enough. Reus is amazing talent who is quick and has a great knack for finishing. Plus he is great at teamwork, good vision, and loves to play a counter attacking style. Young and capable of starting for Chelsea. Also, Pogba is going to die a legend. You can already see him showing signs of a ballon d'or if he keeps it up. 

3) You're forgetting the fact that we are Chelsea. The best club in BPL. With the money AND the quality to attract any top player to our team. We are in a better situation than many of the teams you listed.

4) Please read up on your transfer news before commenting on transfer possibilities. Nothing is worse than someone commenting on things they have no business doing. Read up, learn possibilities, how viable they are, and what players say about other clubs.

&gt; They are not expected to challenge for the title or a top four position

I'm not sure how this supports your comment.  The fact is that Saints are playing much better than LFC (and better than expected) after having had arguably a worse summer window at first glance.  They are coping better.  My comment is not that Saints doing well is disgraceful, but rather that the way in which Saints have coped with their situation highlights our (in my opinion disgraceful) inability to cope with similar struggles.

&gt; The players they brought into their squad were seen as a bit of a gamble

Again, not sure how this supports your argument.  Saints made transfers that worked, we didn't (or they haven't worked yet).  With the respective sizes of each clubs scouting departments (I am not sure, but I imagine LFC's scouting network is larger/better/more extensive than Southampton's), we really should have done better - the fact that we haven't is disgraceful.

&gt; It took a coach with an almost intimate knowledge of these players to bring them to the club

This is a good point and I guess it trumps a team's scouting network in some cases - of which this is one.

&gt; As a consequence of all of these factors nobody really knew what to expect from Southampton as a football team

Another good point, (another good example of this is Sven's first season as Manchester City manager) although, as with Saints, I would have hoped that the number of transfers LFC made meant teams didn't know what to expect from us either.  Unfortunately this hasn't happened.

&gt; Southampton's season could've been the complete opposite of the success story it has been up to this point

false,Volesco,null,null,"&gt; and ended the war with the fourth-largest air force and fifth-largest naval surface fleet in the world.

I've heard it was actually third largest navy. And while this may be true, it's misleading. The reason Canada ranked so highly is because *France, Germany, Japan, Italy, China, the Netherlands, Poland, etc. had had their navies and air forces utterly destroyed in the war*. Canada, like the US, was safe, because it was protected by an ocean. The only countries with any real power after the war were the US, USSR and UK. The gap between them and any other countries (such as Canada) was enormous.

I never said that Canada was irrelevant - far from it. The poster I replied to, however, said that the war would have been lost if Canada hadn't participated. That's just wrong.

The fact of the matter is that the Axis was utterly outnumbered, outgunned and outproduced. Ask any WWII historian and they'll tell you that a lot of things would have had to change in order for the Axis to attain victory. Hell, *you could take the United States of America out of the war* and there's a good chance that Germany, at least, would eventually lose.

An important point is that the war was for the most part decided on the Eastern Front. This is the theater where the Germans lost more than 80% of their casualties, and they were fighting just one country: the Soviet Union. Granted, the USSR received a significant amount of aid from the West; about 5-10% of their overall production. Virtually all of this, however, came from the USA. To my knowledge, Canada gave aid to Britain, but none to the USSR.

Now, [let's look at some numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties#Human_losses_by_country). The USSR had about 10 million military deaths. Germany had 5 million (about 4 million on the Eastern Front, 0.5 million on the Western Front pre-D-day and 0.5 million on the Western Front post-D-day). The US and UK had 0.4 million (spread across Europe and the Pacific). Poland had 0.24 million. France had 0.2 million. India had 0.087 million. Canada had 0.045 million. Consider that casualty ratios were about 1:1 between the West and Germany and we can estimate that about 1 in 100 of the German soldiers killed were killed by Canadian forces.

Granted, that number is a lot more impressive considering Canada's tiny population; per capita, in fact, one could argue that Canada's contribution was greater than the USA's. Per capita, however, is irrelevant in war. Per capita is irrelevant when someone is stating that the war would be lost without Canada.

Incidentally, to drive home the fact that the Axis were utterly boned, [here's a graph of Allied/Axis GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WorldWarII-GDP-Relations-Allies-Axis.png). After Pearl Harbor, the US accounted for most Allied GDP, with most of the rest being from the USSR and to a lesser extent the UK. Canada never made up more than a tiny fraction of it.

Finally, since you bring up 1.1 million citizens under arms, [here's one final set of numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_production_during_World_War_II#Personnel_-_Allied_-_British_Empire). It shows 1.2 million for Canada, 7.6 million for the UK, 1 million for Australia, 2.6 million for India, and 14.7 million for the entire empire. To put Canada on the same level as the UK is ... strange.

Bottom line: Canada's contribution to the war, for a country that wasn't invaded, relative to its population, was impressive. But it was not even close to changing the outcome of the war on its own.

Sorry for the wall of text, but this is the second time I've seen someone claim that the war would have been lost without Canada. It's ridiculous. At least when flag-waving Americans say it about the US there's actually an argument to be made for it.",0,1415623287,null,0,1415624500,0,clyc0ja,t3_2lr199,t1_clyc0ja,t1_clyagnw,null,1426098019,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

This can be gamed - let's say in every constituency in the country 51% of people vote for ""Party A"".

What makes this worse is that the concept of constituencies is rather defunct. Your elected politician does not serve a geographical area. His master is his party - and he votes along party lines. Thus your vote is not about an individual but about a party.

Quite frankly, our high-pressing game (And high-line under AVB) doesn't suit us currently. We should move back to zonal and drop a bit. Unfortunately, that means we're going to start prioritizing defensive tactics over attacking, closing up gaps like we're seeing from lower side clubs who are putting up good performances against the top 6.

&gt; It's good to be anti-Islam ...but not anti-Muslim.

Why is it Islam should be above criticism? Does that apply to fundamentalist Christianity too? 

Or is only Islam exempt from criticism because some Muslims are brown and thus it would be racist to criticise it? So your ideology can be as awful as you want so long as you can have a few brown people who follow it?

UKIP have some non white supporters. I bet you hate UKIP. Seems to me based on your principles you're guilty of UKIPhobia.

I think you're mixing up two very different different concepts - a hatred of an ethnic group and a hatred of a violent totalitarian ideology.

Look at the departure boards.

No. They have waiting areas at each gate and there are doors between you and the coach. You wait until they announce it and someone opens the door.

* Once the Universal Credit is in place, increase VAT and eliminate exemptions but also increase the 'floor' of the UC so that the poorest aren't affected (tonnes. Rough calculations  in my head over £20 billion if you compensate the poorest third of the country)
* Increase the retirement age to 68 next year or the year after rather than phasing it in over decades
* Charging for GP consultations like pretty much any other EU country (£1.2 billion accoridng to the FT)
* Replacing the Barnett formula with a sane one that takes into account population, poverty and rural-ness on a local level (the arbitrary differences are unjustifiable. £5 billion or so maybe?)
* Axe HS2 because it sucks balls (£3 billion per year)
* Raise excise duties by a few percent (a bit over £300 million according to the FT)

Well, I also didn't enjoy watching multiple episodes that centered around the totally abusive and toxic triangle of Clara / Doctor / Danny.  Which leads us back to the **two** needless tearjerker scenes that fell utterly flat because the relationship was so broken. 

At least when Rose kept Mickey on the back burner, he eventually became a Companion, then got into UNIT, and *then* hooked up with Martha.  So he ultimately came out *way* ahead.  Danny just gets lied to, used and fucked over, repeatedly, then goes IMASOLDIEERRRR!!! and kills himself to make the pain stop.  That's downright Victorian in terms of pure hand-wrung melodrama.

Also, it's one thing to ask the audience to suspend their disbelief.  It's another thing entirely when multiple episodes require the audience to forget *grade school* level science.  Especially when multiple such episodes also revolved around hitting the audience over the head with the morality hammer whilst simultaneously ignoring all real-life facts that conflict with the moral.

If you were to be punished due to your membership of a trade union, the company would be in breach of several parts of employment law; including the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.

So saying - you've suggested that 'a letter was placed anonymously' - if it isn't an official union communication that an accredited and trained workplace rep\shop steward then it can be binned without repercussion.  Yes, it's a daft thing for the boss to do as it sparks resentment, but if it's not official communication, it's got no more right to be there than a ranty letter about someone leaving cups in the sink instead of putting them in a dishwasher.

You mention that there are several unions 'involved' - one thing that can't be done by unions is 'poaching' - one isn't allowed to swoop in and steal members, so tread carefully there.  

You can be a member of ANY trade union (one with a recognition agreement is preferable, as they can negotiate on pay\term\conditions, whereas one without recognition can just represet members during disputes and issues.)

So, where do you go from here?  Can't punish your boss for throwing non-official stuff away, but you want to resolve the workplace issues.

You want to get more people represented by your union at work - ask your rep to become more involved (and if there isn't a rep on site, contact your local union office for an officer to get involved.)  They can produce an 'official communication' which they can tell the manager should be left on display.  (And then if manager insists on binning them, let HR know.)

If there ins't a rep, call your local union office, and find out how you can get trained up as a rep; you need to be nominated by other members at your workplace, and there needs to be a certain level of membership - hence my suggestion to talk to the reps of ALL unions on site to get them to investigate and sort out a proper recruitment campaign.

false,Aygers,lfc99,,"Before the 2014-15 season started, how many of us looked at the Southampton team and felt confident about their season going as well as it has? I'm sure most of the fans of the Premier League are (pleasantly) surprised by how well So'ton have been doing so far. Yes their team was picked apart (or that's what it looked like over the summer) and they are a great example of how to deal with losing the core of your team and it's leadership - by making bold and decisive decisions.

Ronald Koeman held quite a few jobs in his career and has also had an excellent playing career, turning out for some big clubs and performing admirably for his national team as well. His transition to management was what an aspiring coach could only wish for, excellent education and time spent learning from some of the best in the profession. He got an opportunity at a big club before but for various reasons it did not work out at Valencia so he was forced to take a step back. His job at Southampton was always likely to either open more doors for him again or not. It's amazing to see him making such bold moves and signing players who most managers seemed to be unsure of for various reasons (Graziano Pelle has been scoring goals for some time now in the Dutch leagues, his stints in Italy haven't been as productive, Duško Tadić also had a steady career in the Netherlands but no-one was willing to offer him a step up until now). Hopefully this explains what I meant when I was writing about gambles and how their season could've turned out very differently up to this point. Their success was by no means a given before they so excellently performed in most of their matches.

They are not expected to challenge for the title or a top four position
I'm not sure how this supports your comment

Simply the expectations at Liverpool are far greater. Even more so after our excellent 2nd place finish in the 2013-14 season. Management was making significant noise about our current season, how we wanted to push for the title again and how we want to add silverware this season. Rodgers made it abundantly clear that the goals for this season are higher than they were for the previous one. Southampton were preparing for a completely different season, one where they were welcoming a new management and building a new core for their team. These are completely different environments for the players to perform in and meet the expectations placed on them. Unfortunately it seems our recruits need more time to live up to the expectation the club and it's fans have placed on them.

I can by no means agree with the harshness of the tone of your initial post in this thread. Yes it is disappointing and I have had a tough time watching some of the games this season just like most of the readers and fans here have. But keep in mind last season was a surprise for everyone, including our management and team. Liverpool out-did themselves during 2013-14. To expect something similar this season was always going to be a huge ask, even if Suarez had stayed and all of our new additions to the roster would have worked out. Sadly we find our team in a rather unpleasant position of unrealized expectation and ambition. This is by no means disgraceful as it happens to sporting teams everywhere all the time.

Yes it's tough to stay positive and optimistic but it's correct to keep some perspective. The team has changed. Rodgers has never before faced a challenge like the one he created for himself. At the end of the previous season I posted about how 2014-15 will be a lot tougher and more demanding for our team. Even expecting a tougher season I never thought it would unfold as it has up to this point and I am disappointed. But I choose to see the positives and my opinion is firm that the team needs tweaks no major changes.

Rodgers could have dealt with some matches a lot better (the losses to Villa or West Ham). The team could have performed a lot better (the losses of form of Gerrard, Johnson, Coutinho, Migs hasn't been up to par, neither has Lovren or Balotelli and Marković, Moreno and Manquillo have had their ups and downs as well and so forth). Injuries haven't helped either. 

These are your every-day challenges of a professional football team. The fact we haven't lived up to our goals and ambition is upsetting but by no means disgraceful. Comparing our team to one that has felt such different challenges and adversity to our own is unfair. While I have utmost respect for Southampton, their history and their fans, the simple fact is Liverpool had far greater ambition then So'ton did. But it is by no means disgraceful that we have not had success in meeting our goals.",0,1415626859,null,0,false,0,clycxrq,t3_2luljg,t1_clycxrq,t1_clybwwq,null,1426097589,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

As much as I love to see Lamela chase down lost causes, what we actually need to look like the team we all want to see is a cohesive team strategy. I can't find the link now, but United gave up a goal in a recent game in a two on two break where Rooney worked his ass off to run past his teammate and help close down on the man with the ball--and in doing so left his man open at the far post. If he'd have stayed with that man and let his teammate close down the man with the ball, they probably could have avoided that. It's a great to see the effort, but it didn't actually help the team.

My point is that while I agree watching lackluster performances is disheartening, ""wanting it more"" or whatever wouldn't actually solve that.

Essentially, all that matters for the limit of the governments budget constraint is real resources and the 'health' of the economy. How much we are spending as a country is no indicator of the economy's 'health'. As long as we engage in spending that increases demand and develops infrastructure, and so improving future efficiency and productivity, you can pretty much spend what you like. The bonus is, that when demand is returned through such policies and the country is running a near full potential, you can easily pay off outstanding debt with all the new taxes coming in. What you don't do is wait until the country is in dire need and then cut the fly wheel that supports the economy in troubled times. 

This may sound like having your cake and eating it, but that is the point, you can have your cake and eat it. In addition it is a tried and tested, and extremely well researched approach - unlike the shake foundations in which the argument for austerity has been founded upon.

Whatever contract he signed last season wouldn't have ever even been considered by him and his agent without a very clear way for him to get to out in the event that one of Real/Barca (or someone like Bayern) came calling for him.  If we genuinely were somehow expecting him to stay then we have the most naive and stubborn management of all time.  It was clear as day, to the point where even supporters who have no clue of the inner workings of the club could tell he was as good as gone.  We didn't want to acknowledge it for the most part because of the euphoria of last season, but it was definitely an idea very present.

This is why some of us on here are upset with how we botched the summer window, which I personally think is why we're in the state we're currently in.  It looked very obvious we were going to lose Suarez in the summer even before he bit Chiellini (which I sincerely doubt had anything to do with us selling him and if it influenced the transfer at all it would've been by potentially lower his selling price) .  We seem to have had exactly 1 replacement target lined up with Sanchez and after he said no we just threw our hands i nthe air and ran around like headless chickens.  Maybe there was a lot more going on behind the scenes, but these days it's very rare that a team is seriously interested in a player and it doesn't end up loudly broadcasted in the rumor mill.  We ended up with Balotelli, a player who could not be more different in style to Suarez.  This means to accommodate Balotelli you have to change how the team plays pretty significantly, so you're losing your best player for someone totally different and then asking the rest of the team to play in a very different manner to accommodate the new signing.  That's too many changing parts at a time.  We had plenty of time to identify and go really hard for players of a similar style to Suarez (albeit worse than Suarez, but the idea is to keep the playing philosophy in tact) and we just sat there with our thumbs up our arses instead.

I'm not hating on  Balotelli here either, I hope he can adapt to our game and our other players can get used to him.  If we can motivate him and find the right tactical balance he can be lethal for us, I still believe that despite his poor start (which I think it as much him personally being in bad form as it is the team not giving much of anything to work with).  I think he was very much the wrong player to go after, but that isn't his fault by any means.  I think even with him here we need to go after a forward in January if it' at all possible.

Channel 4 (which at that time was one of only four free-to-air UK channels) bought the rights to show NFL highlights on a Sunday morning.  So when I was 8-12yrs old it would be part of my weekend morning routine with my brothers.  The show was presented by Gary Imlach, and it would show you highlights from the weekend's NFL games plus some analysis etc.

I would say that most lads in my class at Primary School in the late 1980s had a favourite NFL team... I supported the 49ers, my brother chose the Bears, one lad chose the Cowboys (which at the time was a v poor choice!), others I remember were the Dolphins and the Jets, but most teams had at least one fan in the class.

We knew all the main players and personalities - this was the era of Joe Montana, John Elway, Dan Marino, William ""Fridge"" Perry, Jerry Rice, Mike Dikta - and we had replica shirts, t-shirts, caps etc.  We knew all the stats and would discuss the games on Monday morning, and the rivalry - just for those short few years - was similar to how it was with football [soccer] teams.

I remember being desperate to stay up all night to watch the 1989 superbowl but was only 11 so I wasn't allowed; I tore downstairs the next morning and the first thing I asked my Dad was whether the 49ers won and I had significant bragging rights for the next few weeks on the back of it.

Until he isn't.

The way I see it, the only way of arguing against this is to point out that it is not *today* you should worry about, but *tomorrow*: McCarthyism, for example, saw a sudden change were membership of legal political organisations years in the past could cause people to lose their jobs, and where people were even questioned about their political leanings because of their *parents* political involvement while the person being question was only a child. Before McCarthy people did not really wave their communist party membership books around in public, but they had relatively few reasons to keeping their involvement secret. Then McCarty came along, and suddenly their past - fully legal - actions got people treated as national security threats. 

If the government becomes interested in you *tomorrow*, say because you stumble across something to greatly embarrass them, or you run for office on a platform that scares the establishment, or because a more dangerous government comes into power, or just because you get dragged into the periphery of some investigation (say you're a witness to something that causes someone with power to want to discredit you), and the government have years worth of data about what you've done in the past, you don't need to have done anything wrong. You just need to have done something that can be twisted and turned into something you or your family don't want your family to read about in the newspapers, or something that can be suitably redefined to be bad.

Imagine McCarthyism if the government could have  a surveillance agency simply search through data for anyone that had ever e-mailed or called any members of ""questionable"" political organisations at a point when people did not have any reason to fear openly being in contact with those organisations.

Also: Creating the perfect tools for oppression makes seats of power far more attractive to those who might seek to abuse them.

If you can drive, clutch control is more or less the same as it is in a car - just with your hand. It takes a little time to get used to coordinating your hands and feet, moreso than in car (IMO) but after a few lessons you stop thinking about it.


A 600 may seem scary at first; the throttle is more responsive, faster, the bike is heavier and so on. It's difficult to describe but don't limit yourself to just a 125 or a scooter. You really would be missing out on all the fun :) As the saying goes; the bigger the better. Like with everything, it just takes a little getting used to.

The reason why is because the economy has grown, new industries have sprung up, smaller industries have grown, and even in industries that are highly mechanized and automated, machines need to be designed and built, then they need to be powered and maintained, the products they make require materials, and then be sold and maintained or disposed of and replaced.

He is by far the best captain we (Ajax) have had in years.

So maybe it is just Spurs.

Personally, I can imagine it must be very depressing as a 'top' player, which is definitely what players like lloris, vertonghen, eriksen, lamela would see/imagined themselves at this stage in their career to be playing for pretty much nothing every match in a mediocre Spurs side. The fact that this then affects the ayers around them and only worsens the performance works as a very negative spiral. I think the issue with those players is that spurs could afford them, and offer them playing time at a high level. It just turns out that the level spurs were at a couple of years ago was above their actual level, which leaves you with a lot of players at the club who think they are better than the club (which they might be).

Honestly I'd have to disagree about his defensive capabilities. I think he's excellent in the deep role if theres runners either side which we clearly have in Henderson, Can, and Allen. Newcastles midfield crumbled defensively when he was sold. 

Also if we bought him we could still keep Allen:

Cabaye- Playmaker, set-piece taker, leader

Henderson- Box to box engine

Allen- Pure CM, the link between defence, midfield and attack

Can- Pure strength in the box to box role or as a DM

Coutinho- Creativity

Lovren was quality last year and there is no reason why he won't come good. He is a very solid and commanding defender, he will become a leader but he's obviously struggling with form and confidence. Playing in an already poor defence hasn't helped that. Worst defender in the league claim is laughable.

You're saying Lallana is shite because he wasn't brought on in the last game? You serious? Whether he's value for money or not is one thing, he quite clearly is good enough to play for us though.

Markovic is a kid and could look like great value in a few years, writing him off as shit now is, again, short-sighted.

I was a goalkeeper and I have to say that my biggest hero is petr cech. I think I was coming off of a nasty ankle injury and was giving it a bit of a flitch when going in hard to tackles (small sided playing not keeper during practice) just as it was still tender. 

Then I see Petr cech who literally puts his life on the line every match and it was inspiring. I followed him into the club and it's been everything I've wanted out of being a fan. SO many great players and I feel that the spirit of work ethic is a driving force behind our performances. And this season getting costa who's work ethic is through the roof I just see many great years to come from him. 

His performance as the fan's motm in the CL final in which he saved that penalty vs robben was one of my greatest memories as a chelsea fan. Saved the game for the blues. [Here's a video for you guys of that whole performance but I'll set it on the penalty.](http://youtu.be/2s4KvasFeKc?t=6m23s) 5:15 is also a tremendous save. The end is the pk shootout where he makes another honestly technically more difficult save allowing for chelsea to win (along with a miss from a bayern player.) It was literally one of the greatest performances from a keeper ever in my opinion. Take a look if you have the time.

But yeah I still think the better kepper at the moment in on the bench but curtois will likely hold up this clubs record of excellency in goalkeeping. Just wish he'd give up less easy rebounds and hold on to the ball. It's like his gloves are allergic i swear.

Amongst all the patriotism that surrounds Remembrance Day, it's important to take a step back.

To have one without the other is to have a warped view of our history.

The UK has done some good stuff. Fighting in the Second World War against Fascism is one of the most important that springs to mind. But it also enslaved hundreds of thousands. It brutally subjugated entire peoples. It denied hundreds of millions the right to self-determination for centuries, and continues this in a few instances to this day.

I thought this before, but this season was pretty weak in that department. I get the feeling they sort of boxed themselves in with characters that weren't all that compelling. Clara worked ok when she was ""The Impossible Girl"" but after that arc played out, she was just a moody tag-along. They tried to build this tension between herself and the new Doctor and whether she actually trusted him, and then threw Pink in the mix to further muddy up the dynamic. 

In the end, none of the characters' motivations for doing anything they were doing felt genuine or carried much weight. Clara and Pink were a pretty run of the mill love story. Clara and Doctor swung wildly between totally adoration to almost open hostility (like in this episode when Clara professed her total trust in the Doctor to Cyber-Pink unknowingly, and literally the next scene chucked the phone while talking to the Doctor when she didn't like what he was saying). Pink and Doctor.. I don't even know... what was that relationship even supposed to be other two sides for Clara to be torn between?

Still, I gotta give Moffat credit in some areas. The twist at the end when Pink sends the kid back instead of himself was incredible. Then, the scene in the coffee shop was absolutely brilliant, between both Clara and Doctor lying to each other for each other's good without knowing the other was doing the same and the line about hugging and hiding faces.

Also he brings up some great creations like the Silence whom you forget after looking at and whom we kill and forget about but that opens up many questions such as if they have been manipulating us for centuries why had the Doctor never noticed before and with them gone how would humanity develop on its own?

Human capital is being devalued. Once our minds have been automated, what left for humans to contribute? There will be a lot of people who view their entire lives as futile, surplus to requirements leaving a massively divided society with tremendous civil unrest.

Automation has been hitting blue collar jobs for a long time, now it's starting to hit white collar jobs. Off the top of my head, say solicitors. A large part of their capital is derived from knowledge of past court cases, then applying a likely result to a future case. That knowledge can be automated and compiled into some software. The role of the doctor is already being automated, with websites like WebMD providing a substitute for a traditional GP. For every GP visit there are probably 100 people who didn't bother visiting and self-diagnosed via the internet. Soon a robot will be able to perform surgery too, more accurately and more efficiently than a surgeon. It already can with laser eye surgery.
Accounting software exists. GPS has reduced the value of human knowledge, back then a cabbie needed to have a good knowledge of the streets tied up in his brain. Now that knowledge is redundant. Software and GPS means that I could be a cabbie tomorrow and be just as good as a cabbie who's been doing it for 20 years. Case in point, look at the explosion in minicab firms. Airliners can, if desired, be totally controlled via software. Soon it'll be more efficient and safer than a human pilot. The only reason it isn't already controlled by software is because the software is not quite there yet, but it won't be long before it is. Self-driving cars too. If you look even further down the line think about 3D printing. Most things in your home that is manufactured could theoretically be made by a printer and advanced plastics.

I understand now what you mean about the expectation level.  Another user mentioned this as well (although in much more sardonic fashion!), it is a good point and I should have taken it into consideration.

They have gotten very very lucky up front in that the players they brought in(who incidentally also played for Koeman previously) have bedded in spectacularly well.

We on the other hand have been the reverse. Our already porous defence is as leaky as ever and without both Suarez and Studge we have struggled to get goals.

Rodgers also has the issue that two of his main attacking signings(Balotelli and Markovic) have both been shit. The issue is that he has persevered with them for so long(granted Markovivc has not been making the squad of late) We have also been unlucky with injuries to players like Markovic and Lallana as well as Studge, Allen, a plethora of fullbacks, Sahko, and Can.

But the last few weeks have seen an upturn. Lallana, Can, Moreno, Manquillo, and Lovern have all improved over the first few weeks. Even Balotelli and Markovic look like they are trying to put in a shift(even if it seems they have no clue what they are doing).

A few more ""lucky breaks"" and a few more correct calls and I can see a 12 point haul from the next 4 games which would put us back in a very good position.

**What we need to do is take some deep breathes and re-asses and not do anything silly and reactionary in terms of personnel and transfers. Leave it to the summer.**

 let the manager and the people in charge of transfers and our footballing direction sit down together and figure out what is going wrong and where are we most vulnerable-even if that means waiting until Summer.

people might fault for my lack of ambition and i do really with all my heart want to defend the title and do well in the champions league, but i would be quite content with just finishing within the top 3.

Now to the fun part, What transfers would *I* like to see? well i think we need:



[**Need**]: A top quality Winger and I think we've needed him for a while. Navas on his day can be phenomenal but his whole game is quite one dimensional, we need a winger who can do more than 'get to the byline and cross straight into the path of the defender'. Chelsea have Hazard, United have Di Maria, Arsenal have Alexis Sanchez; they are all so dynamic. Also it means Silva can play more in his preferred #10 role.

[**Who Would I Like To See?**]:

Well **Marco Reus** would be an absolute dream and of course I would love to have him on our team, he should be our top transfer target but lets be honest, i am very, very skeptical of him coming to City. Perhaps **Lucas Moura**? i have been a huge admirer of his talents and he is just brimming with creativity, speed and is not afraid to take on his man-which is a directness we sometimes lack, but he has found his feet at PSG and is another on the unlikely list. I mean to be honest we really need a quality winger but there doesn't seem to be many available out there?

[**Need**] A Left Back who wont get beaten by anyone with 2 legs and who remembers to pass only to people wearing the same shirt as him. Clichy is a great guy and I respect and love him for what he has helped us achieve but it is clear he no longer is up to scratch and eventually needs to be sold (obviously not in January)

[**Who Would I Like To See?**]

Again another area where there is sparse selection, maybe **De Sciglio** from AC Milan? 

[**Need**] Another Box to box midfielder. Ideally i would like us playing 4-2-3-1 with midfield core of Yaya-Fernando-Fernandinho . If we where to play this though we would need another Box to Box midfielder who could play as a CM as well as a DM because the boys would be getting worn out from playing ever game. Also he would be a replacement for Lampard for he leaves to NYCFC.

[**Who Would I Like To See?**]

Obvious name would be **Paul Pogba**, the guy is young and has a very physical box to box style like yaya toure. It would be future proofing for the eventual departure of Yaya as he is almost an exact replacement. Pogba also developed here in england but im unsure as to whether he fulfills home grown criteria, also rag tears are tasty. However Pogba would cost an arm and a leg and then some and honestly i dont see it happening. Given Bayern's midfield glut i would love to see us try at least for **Javi Martinez**-but that is never going to happen. **Sami Khedira** seems like an available target as RM want to get rid, plus would love to taste some gooner tears.

[**Need**]

A consistent Attacking Midfielder who regularly creates a lot of chances, gets a lot of assists and contributes with some goals. 
We have one in David Silva bud the guy is over worked, we rely on him alot and it means he gets played alot. We need someone who can come in and give Silva a rest or even play with him.

[**Who Would I Like To See?**]

**Isco**. I'm dying for an Isco-Pellegrini re-union, but he has settled in very well at RM after a tumoltous start. But such is the nature of real madrid that one minute he might be in favour the next he might not get a game for ages, RM is pact full of talent and its possible Isco might consider re-uniting with Pellers and coming here.

Again though most of these are unrealistic, what we need to really do is nothing this January and give Pellegrini and the board plenty of time re-asses. We cant do anything reactionary and we will be rewarded for our patience with a more coherent strategy in the transfermarket and in the clubs dealing.

TL;DR:

Dont buy anything in january, dont do anything reactionary or hasty, give manager and board time. 

What would i like to see in the **summer?**

IN

Rues-unlikey

Pogba-unlikely or Khedira-viable

Isco-unlikely

De Sciglio-viable

Out

Clichy

Nasri

Lampard

Navas Maybe?

Soton has much less pressure to perform than we do, and they haven't lost their top goalscorer (goals being by far the hardest stat to buy in players). Further, I think you could argue that they kept their core even after the transfers (for instance, WhoScored has them as only losing 4 of their top 10 rated performers from last year), which makes their transfers more likely to succeed than you make out.

Honestly, the original comment comes off like someone who has no context. Every year there is a team that overachieves in the first half.

Fill that site in as if you are an 18 year old without a job having to rent a place on your own (not a council house).

I've just done it and in my council area our 18 year old NEET would get £8,500 a year (tax free). Working a minimum wage full time job would get you £9,234 a year (also tax free as it's all in the allowance).

If you're living with mum and dad at 18 the difference is even more pronounced, as you get no housing benefits so you're probably about £2K better off.

The myth that the benefits system rewards people more for staying at home is ridiculous. The reason people stay at home and don't work is generally because they lack skills, ambition, or education needed to work.

I completely agree with the sentiment here - they should go and give 100% regardless - but to play devils advocate:  How would you feel if you had 40,000 people watching everything you did and booing you if you got it wrong, or didn't perform perfectly. You'd end up snapping. Mentally, this gets to you, they're still human, regardless of the renumeration. (which is a different point).

So you play badly one match and get a bit of a kicking from the fans. That's fine, you think; I'll play better next time. But you don't, and the team lose again. Eventually this sets into a mental block: you're worried about what'll happen next time, so you're *extra* careful to try to not put a foot wrong, but sadly, you do, because when you try *especially* hard for something not to happen, what inevitably happens? Exactly.

Think about it in the context of Bale: he ended up with this anchor round his neck about never having been on a winning side in the PL. That's there, affecting him, niggling at the back of his head. 

Eventually, 'Arry decides to get rid of it. It's not grand, it's not pretty, but he comes on as a sub at the end of a game we can't lose, and suddenly it's gone: that tag, that weight on  his mind. He can play without worrying about making a mistake, because even if he makes one and the other team score, it's not going to make sure that run continues. He's free.

And that's why the players need the fans: because they're human, and they put enough pressure on themselves. Playing at home is meant to be an advantage because of the '12th man'. if that concept fails to exist, then what's the point of playing at home? You will always perform better to someone you think cares about what you're doing. 

Yes - we, as fans deserve more on the pitch - but it's a symbiotic relationship in terms of performance. We need to show we're behind them to give them confidence, and they in turn should take that belief from us and play better. I know we're fed up of lacklustre performances, but there's been so much turmoil, what do you expect? as /u/yesitwouldbenice said - it's a team game, and we're not playing as a team. How can you?

I'm concerned of the ramifications of this episode. Granted, Doctor Who doesn't always stick with continuity unless it benefits current storytelling, but if The Brigadeer was Cybermanified, am I the only one kinda freaked out by that? 

If for example Amy and Rory were buried after death under Angel captivity, it means they are Cybermen now. Sarah Jane Smith may be one now too, and I think she richly deserves to Rest In Peace. In fact anyone The Doctor has ever met on Earth, who died and was buried on Earth in the past 10K yrs, could be flying around in space with Danny Pink. Not every companion would fit this bill but I bet at least a dozen would qualify. And also several scores of historical figures. Margaret Thatcher for example. Peter OToole. John Kennedy. Would Queen Nefertiti qualify? 

I'm not sure which would be worse, to ignore this development next season, or use it In future stories? Missy madea point to save everyone she could find that The Doctor was not able to save. And they weren't always on Earth when she saved them either. Presumably, the mind and body didn't necessarily have to match altho they did make a big deal about cremating. That coulda just been The Master's masochism showing. She could have made exceptions for special cases. 

So a writer could now bring back any character the Doctor has ever met in a completely new body, Inside a Cyberman. It would be just as feasible as Danny Pink or The Brigadeer. You just have to clarify they never hit that Delete button before conversion just like Danny and the Brigadeer obviously didn't. 

And if you can upload conciousness to Gallifreyan technology, then download it to a Cyberman, you should be able to copypaste entire minds to other compatible devices. I doubt a cellphone would be sufficient but what about other carbon based humanoid lifeforms of natural or artificial design?

Trophy wise though, you can pick and choose depending on how you want to run it. Look at the last 10 years and they've got an FA Cup compared to an FA Cup, a League Cup and a Champions League title for us. Go back 10 more years and they're a fair bit more successful. 10 years more and it swings massively into our favour again. 

Really, neither of us is in a position to say which is better without a crystal ball. Man City and Chelsea have overhauled their squads in certain years and got success from it. Man Utd are probably going to have to if they want to win anything any time soon. If those club go bankrupt when they lose owners happy to pour money down a hole every year, then Arsenal win out. If they don't, then it might be another 10 years before Arsenal win a trophy again. Also for the record I feel that FSG are trying to bring us closer to the sustainable model that Arsenal have, and that's why we're investing so much in young, up-and-coming talent.

Last season we played well with the diamond and two, so logically I thought maybe we'd try to fix the holes in that (for me, LB, RCB, CDM, GK, and, after Suarez left, striker).  Instead, we bought Moreno (good, checks the boxes as an improvement), another LCB instead of a RCB to replace the LCB we just bought and in turn forcing Agger out, no CDM, no GK, and Balotelli who is the furthest thing from a Suarez replacement I can think.

We also picked up a couple of winger-types in Markovic and Lallana, neither of which really fit into that sort of formation, a striker we had to leave out on loan to get when we needed a striker, another box-to-box mid in the mould of Henderson but who isn't any better than him, and an inexpensive older striker who also doesn't really fit the style of play.

My conclusion from all of this is BR has no intention really of going back to the 2 up top style of play (unless he gets forced to, but at the moment Balotelli's form is such that it is entirely feasible he plays Sturridge solo when he is fit), but wants to move back to the really boring and largely unsuccessful 4-3-3 he tried to play when he first came, added to which his complete refusal to play Balotelli with a partner.

Then they'll put you on a bike in an off-road training area and teach you the basics. It's like a mini CBT and will give you a chance to see if you like it without spending any money. Also, when you do book the CBT you'll find it a little easier as you'll alreayd have had an hour or so on a bike.

2) If I had basically no money, £61 a month is a fucking lot. For a start it means you can go out drinking twice a month with your friends. It means you can probably go out for a meal or two.

Plus, as well all know, having an actual job means you can probably work your way up and get a better job, one where you wont get paid shit all, but people don't think they will be able to, they see it as ""Get that job, keep that job"" instead of a stepping stone.

Although the great majority of casualties in WW1 were from the working class, the social and political elite were hit disproportionately hard by WW1. Their sons provided the junior officers whose job it was to lead the way over the top and expose themselves to the greatest danger as an example to their men.

Some 12% of the British army's ordinary soldiers were killed during the war, compared with 17% of its officers. Eton alone lost more than 1,000 former pupils - 20% of those who served. UK wartime Prime Minister Herbert Asquith lost a son, while future Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law lost two. Anthony Eden lost two brothers, another brother of his was terribly wounded, and an uncle was captured.

He's superb keeping possession and finding simple passes, but he's not an incisive player.  If you have Cabaye collecting the ball and quickly finding Allen, the pace of our play stops there.  But if you have Allen collecting the ball deep then finding Cabaye quickly, play continues to bulid up speed and we get the chance to move forward quickly.

I also think Cabaye is far more dangerous when he's got as much freedom as possible, which he gets more as one of the runners than he does having to stay deep.  He's got an eye for goal and can create chances all over the place.  Sitting him deep shackles him a little bit.  I think he played so deep for France at the world cup out of circumstance more than anything as neither Pogba nor Matuidi are disciplined enough to sit in there.  If we have a strong defensive midfielder behind him (like Tiote was when he was at Newcastle) then we can really get the best out of him.  

Can can sit as the defensive midfielder as well, he's a pretty smart player positionally.  Can/Henderson/Cabaye is sexy.

As bikes go, the YBR125 is a fantastic choice. I'm riding a CBR125 (as you can see above) which I love, but my girlfriend is learning on the YBR, and as a result I've tried both out. Mine's more fun - it feels like a full-sized bike, it sounds better, the clutch is light as a feather - but the YBR is far, far more nimble and obedient, and thus better for practicing low-speed clutch control and maneuvering. That stuff is 100% the hardest part, and mastering it will make you a better rider altogether.

If you're concerned about weight, the YBR is practically weightless. Aforementioned girlfriend is 5'4"" and having no issues whatsoever with moving the thing about. You might want to consider the YBR custom also; my sister learned on that. It's the same bike as the YBR in most respects, but it sits a little lower down and has some shiny chrome - so it's even easier to handle, but less nimble in corners. The chrome makes it a little more alarming to drop since that stuff scratches easily.

To be honest, the hardest part both of the abovementioned ladies I know have experienced has been sorting out biking gear. If you want to go fully geared-up (as you probably should) with jacket, trousers, gloves and boots, it can be difficult to find good women's gear. Easier if you don't mind all the pink nonsense, but the range is still much more limited than men's stuff.

One more thing: you can probably try biking for free.

Balotelli can be an incredible player, several of his previous managers (including Mourinho) have said he has the raw potential to be one of the best in the world if he tries and, while I like Remy a lot, he's never going to be that class of player. Of course actually exploiting that potential is where every team has struggled, his moments of brilliance are overshadowed by off-pitch antics but they dealt with Suarez and they have more time to try and control a player who's going to likely start for them often than Chelsea would for a player who spent most of his time on the bench.

Short-term Remy is the smart choice. For Chelsea he was definitely the right choice because Costa is a better option than either and Remy seems like he'd be more content to play a secondary role than Balotelli. But if Liverpool somehow manage to conquer Balotelli then he's going to be a lot better than Remy.

No one I knew in any service industry jobs ever had a contract. Nearly ever chef I worked with did 50 hours minimum, and fairly regularly up to 70 and even 80 hours a week once or twice. In addition, tips were withheld by the owners and dished out at their discretion. Towards the end of my second last job, I was working on average 50 hours a week and only getting paid for around 42 of those hours.

See above. I don't buy the official statistics.

Because they see what is happening to areas of the country where immigration is high and do not like it? Because a lot of people who move out to those areas come from areas of the country that have been subjected to mass immigration, this being a determining factor in their decision to move in the first place.

There are plenty of reasons for this.

&gt;Second, why, when “net migration is down a quarter from its peak under Labour and . . . from outside the European Union is down to its lowest level since 1998” – as Cameron boasted at PMQs on 29 October – has concern about immigration continued to skyrocket, to a point where it now tops the list of voters’ priorities, ahead of the economy and the NHS?

Perhaps it is because we are beginning to understand the long term ramifications of such high migratory figures?

This seems to be a silly question to ask. Just because net migration has been reduced from the excessive Labour years (to which many former Labourites have come out and admitted was immoral) does not mean people aren't going to be concerned anymore. If you look at the actual immigration figures of people coming in, it hasn't really changed all that much.

Furthermore, many people realise that we're actually powerless to stop such high levels of immigration whilst remaining within the European Union.

&gt;Third, why do people think that far more immigrants live in the UK than actually do?

Because the average person is utterly clueless about statistics in general.

You could quite easily make the argument that the perception of higher levels of immigration comes from the fact that large areas of our country are populated by what seems to be large immigrant communities. This seems to be the case with many of England's cities.

&gt;Fourth, why was 70 per cent of the public telling Gallup as long ago as 1978 that Britain was “being swamped” by people with different cultures, even though net migration at the time was negative – more people were leaving the UK than were arriving – and had been so for more than a decade?

No idea mate, I wasn't around in the 70's or even the 80's.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will concede that immigration isn't strictly an argument about jobs, culture or public services. There are a lot of White British people who have no desire to see themselves become an ethnic minority in, what it is they consider to be, their own ancestral homeland. I think this is a concern that would be shared by people in most of the world's nations that have indigenous populations.

Right the way through Classic Who, the cybermen has flexible metallic coverings. Even though the ones that we see now are textures and jointed, there is no reason that the individual pieces shouldn't be flexible, or squishy, any more.  

&gt;The cybermen can fly, and airforce infinity is the most defensible position they could think of? Where's the UK's version of Norad?

Politics. Getting an agreement like this at all was probably a miracle of negotiation. No nation will accept that the President should be located in another nation's Emergency Command Facility though. Getting into international airspace was probably the only workable compromise.  

&gt;And where's the fighter escort?

The cybermen took them out without even slowing down.

&gt;Cy-Danny saves Clara and takes her to... a graveyard?

Pass.  Would need to rewatch. 

&gt;President of the Earth, first order of business is interrogating the bad guy. I would think the president could send someone to do that.  

""Sending someone down"" to interrogate Missy? Oh yes, that would work, I can see. /s  

President or not, his first order of business is dealing with the most important threats in order - at least triaging them. Threat 1? Missy. Threat 2? cyberclouds. And that is pretty much what he did.  

&gt;Let's do our work on the bad guy's tech in the same room as the bad guy, and not even behind bars.  

The plane is a mobile command facility, by the look of it, with some tech analysis equipment, but limited by space it is hardly going to be equiped for all possible cirumstances, and so has no dedicated holding facility. It is noticable that the Doctor didn't leave Osgood until she had impressed him with her competence, to the point where he felt that she might be safe to be left with Missy. He had overestimated her.  

&gt;Osgood got an invite to be a new companion before she's been inside the TARDIS? She's dead.

Fangirl baiting. As an old curmudgeon I'm not complaining.  

&gt;British guards, even when they don't have a stupid furry hat on they can't move even when something is happening.  

Delgardo's Master, way back in Classic Who would hypnotise guards time and time again (even the ones that had been chosen to be ""immune"" to hypnosis). Missy clearly did the same here.  

&gt;Scottish accent in a windstorm. Can anyone understand what's being said. Belgum? It's not French? What?

Kill some Belgians: they're not even French.  

&gt;""Permission to SQUEEE!"" Okay, they get to take a sin off for that one.

Loved it.  

&gt;You need an uplinked and friendly cyberman to answer your questions? Why's it have to be Danny? There's a whole bunch of harmless baby cybermen wandering around.  

They wouldn't be primed to relay the details as they ""went under"" though. They were already inhibited.  

 &gt;Holy crap, Missy's performance. This scene. She's funny, she's terrifying, she's pleading, she's angry. Amazing. And the Doctor's response. This is why all the sins don't count.

Totally agree.  

&gt;Someone forgot Cyber-Danny's sunken eye makeup at the end.  

Pass. Didn't notice.

&gt;Nice speech Danny, but I'm not sure your Cybermen were listening. They're brain dead.  

Inclined to agree. Psyching himself up, perhaps.  

&gt;Cy-Brig is still around? How many other dead are around? They're never going to revisit it, are they?  

It seems to me that it was hardly a coincidence that the Cyber-Brig was around the plane to start with. I think Missy had this planned from the start. She made sure that the Brig would retain his emotions, she positioned him around the plane, she armed the Cyber-Brig with a teleporter instead of a gun, and she told him where to find them in the cemetery. When he fired, all he actually did was teleport her back to her TARDIS.

She had a history with the Brigadier, so doing this and then making him save her just when he thought that he was killing her would fit her style very well, it seems to me.  

If you want to get really dark? After getting back to her TARDIS, she used the Cyber-net to let the Brig know what he had just done, just as the Doctor saluted him - he didn't nod in acknowledgement: that was his realization of defeat - and then she flipped his inhibitor. After that he followed the last queued order and took off to detonate in the atmosphere. There is no revisiting to be done,

I don't think it was just the jeering every time a pass was misplaced; I think Stoke need to get a lot of credit for the way they pressured. They are a harder-working team than us. 

I think Hughes was very specifically targeting Capoue as well. He had absolutely no time on the ball at any point in the first half. 

We honestly should have made a switch in the first half, at least tactically. Just to put the players in easier positions to gain some confidence. Like moving Eriksen deeper and playing a 4-3-3 with Capoue as a single anchor. 

We basically played 4-3-3 in the second half until Ade came on, and while we weren't great, we were a lot better in central midfield. 

As for the atmosphere at WHL, I honestly thought in the second half it sounded okay. First was incredibly toxic. I know you don't get the full picture through a TV screen, but it almost felt as if a lot of fans just had an epiphany and went back to the days where we were mediocre but had among the best home support in the league.
