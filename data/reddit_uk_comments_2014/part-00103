If you think the taliban are interested in diplomacy I'm not even sure if I should dignify that with a response.

Did they practice rule of law, with an independent judiciary? How about elections? Has their leadership even changed much since then?

I appreciate that being a foreign fan you probably get stung by people claiming you're not a 'real' fan and I'm with you, really I am, but to swing it the other way and give us the old 'you need us' line smacks of arrogance and disrespect for the locals. 

Like it or not we are different and as I said I like foreign fans, by and large your good people with evidently good taste and as individuals you can be as committed to the cause as any full blooded scouser, but for us it's also a family connection as well as a sports one. I know there are thousands of you out there who aren't English and whose parents and grandparents were reds and if they were then congratulations you share the bond I'm talking about and you're part of the 'us' I'm talking about. The difference between first generation fans and those with older family ties is that our connection isn't just rooted in liking as song or a style of play or a particular player, it's not even about football really, it's part of our family history. When we see those crowds cheering for Shanks or Bob or roaring on a cup final display, they aren't just fellow sports fans they're our family photographs. We have the stories of away trips to Rome, of the standing kop, of our dads and granddads travels across the country with their mates and their family. Liverpool is part of our family folklore and it's a link to the lives of people we love or we've lost even to those we may never have met. It has little to do with the ability to support the team or the knowledge of football trivia and it shouldn't be seen as a slight on the newer fans that you can't share in that. It's not because you're inferior in anyway it's just that there are personal experiences that we have and that you don't, we're not better fans we just have deeper roots.  

Apologies if that got a bit rambling, hopefully it clarifies where some of us locals are coming from when we talk about being different from foreign fans. ",0,1397238821,null,0,false,0,cgpyhxk,t3_22s4q8,t1_cgpyhxk,t1_cgpucd9,null,1433312274,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

There are only a handful of combinations out of the many thousands of possible results that could happen over the course of the season...so whilst it's still *possible*, there's only like 40 situations in a couple of thousand that would see it happen, if that makes sense.

true,abowsh,1986,Oscar,"Actually, speaking with an attorney friend who is very well educated on US contract law, and has a decent knowledge of UK contract law due to some international clients, he thinks this is technically an illegal move by UEFA. 

If it is true that there was a payment clause about playing in this game between Chelsea and AM, then that must be enforced or the entire contract is void. UK contract laws apparently states that any disputes about the language of the contract after signing must be done in a reasonable time after the contract has been signed. This contract is nearly complete, so I have a hard time believing anyone could argue that UEFA challenged the contract within a reasonable time. 

Additionally, UEFA accepted the terms of the contract and allowed Courtois to play in many UEFA competitions throughout the year. Unless both parties (Chelsea and AM) agree to a modification of terms, UEFA only has the right to enforce the contract as it currently is written, or to completely reject it. If they enforce it as it is, the fee must be paid or the teams must come to an agreement. If the reject it, Courtois is not eligible to play for AM in this game, or any other UEFA sponsored events. 

However, we both agreed that Courtois will play as the teams will not want to fight and cause a distraction or hurt relations between the clubs. UEFA is completely wrong here. If they had an issue with the possibility of Courtois playing against Chelsea, that needed to be addresses well in advance. On top of all the legal issues, this just makes UEFA look terrible and completely unprofessional. This is a basic contract, UEFA shouldn't be struggling with interpretation nearly a year after it was signed.

chelsea and city have a horrible habit of buying more than they need so players, no matter how good or highly rated they are, are never really guaranteed a spot - unless they paid a lot for you (think Sturridge - Torres). 

Now these young player who were scouted for their potential talent have grown up and developed with all the best training and coaching money can buy, but have now reached an age and a point in their careers where they believe they are ready to showcase their talents to the world but due to positional overcrowding cant get a look in at the first team, infact they are struggling to make the bench - not so much due to lack of ability but rather because there are 3/4 much more experienced higher paid and earning players infront of them. 

So eventually these kids are going to get fed up of not getting a look in at the first team and decide they need to move on, so these teams decide to sell at a discounted price - now the kids who didnt get a look in before now get a lot of playing time with their new teams and start to progress with the additional experience and start to shine

this is roughly what happened with Sturridge and coutinho, i think the same goes for pogba aswell - the point im trying to make is even though chelsea and city may end up buying all the young talent they cant use it all so eventually other teams will benifit",0,1397239950,null,0,false,0,cgpz0hi,t3_22scs7,t1_cgpz0hi,t1_cgpxx8k,null,1433312517,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Gerrard would also be back there to patrol the area mopping up loose balls and keeping Yaya quiet.

When in possession, Lucas/Allen would play their usual safe ball to Gerrard and he can spray his passes out to SASAS and attack quickly.

Then again, City are probably expecting Gerrard's quick balls and will have something up their sleeve to stop it. Also, I'm not a manager and I know I'd never be one, so what do I know? Haha.

true,Andures,null,null,"Yes but the point, I think, is that their initial investment into their youth development can potentially give them great benefits eventually. Looking at two different scenarios, if the talented young players are unable to break into the first team due to them 'overstocking' on big-name superstars, then they would be loaned out to gain experience and then sold for great profit. If Chelsea sells both Lukaku and Courtois, for example, that would probably give them a good 50 million pounds, which is huge. If, on the other hand, FFP requires them to tone down on their buying, then they might already have a ready stock of talented youngsters who might be hungry to get some first team chances. 

I think the biggest problems with both teams is that they have huge pressure to attain instant success, which makes it harder for their constant ""rotating doors"" of managers to take a long term view on the development of players. For clubs such as them with so much revenue/financial backing, a new manager would surely find it easier to go for an established star rather than promoting a youngster. It's a two-sided blade, since if you buy an expensive player who might not play up to expectations due to a high price tag, you'll get blasted for being a poor assessor of ability or a wastrel, but if you don't buy big names and promote younger players who are not capable performing at the highest level, you get blasted for wasting a transfer season and failing to improve the squad. That, like you said in the second part of your comment, is the biggest obstacle to a really effective development plan.

As an American, I didn't come to like Liverpool after any success they had. I heard about the club, it's history, and the support, and was also drawn because of what I saw of Gerrard at the World Cup.

I've been a Liverpool fan for almost 8 full seasons now. I've seen us play absolutely shit football and kept waking up over here at 7 (yes, to be a fan of a club outside that country actually takes some dedication) and now 5 (new west coast life) on the weekends.

Well, I've gone on a long bit.

The thing is, you have to ask yourself what you care about? A new fan isn't necessarily a shit one. I was once a new fan and now I have no doubt I'm more dedicated than at least half the dickheads walking around Liverpool in the kit.

A person will be sentanced for a certain amount of time - e.g. this man was jailed for 9 years. But within our prison sentance, people are often released early for good behaviour - e.g. a 9 year sentance may be reduced to only 3 years. This early release is entirely discretionary. If someone doesn't show remorse, or acts like they will re-offend immediately upon release, then the prison service will be fully within their rights to force someone to serve the full length of their sentance.

As you say, after he has served his sentance he should be released. All I'm suggesting is that the current system can be applied in this case - i.e. his behaviour should affect whether he is released **before** he has served his full sentance.",0,1397242734,null,0,1397243081,0,cgq0a95,t3_22rhnk,t1_cgq0a95,t1_cgpxlrt,null,1433313115,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ianrush88,null,null,"I think it's unlikely we'll go back to a double pivot midfield. As far as I see there are two options:

The 4-3-3 we used against Everton and Arsenal where the central midfield is Gerrard; Henderson, Coutinho. The advantage of this is it gets Coutinho on the pitch in a position where he can really hurt teams, and gets Sterling wide if we want to attack one of their fullbacks. The main disadvantage is that it's pretty much an all-out attack team and is less good at maintaining possession. It's all about staying compact in defence, winning the ball and then flooding forward straight away. 

The other option is the diamond, which is where Lucas might fit in. Against West Ham he played as the left-sided shuttling midfielder in a diamond of Gerrard; Lucas, Henderson; Sterling. If we do use the diamond Lucas would be fighting it out with Allen for that left-sided spot. The diamond is a bit less dynamic in attack - counter-attacks would rely on Suarez and Sturridge running into the channels, and Coutinho probably wouldn't start, but would probably give us more ""control"", with Sterling pulling their deep midfielders all over the place allowing us to dominate midfield (as at old trafford) and their fullbacks reluctant to push forward for fear of leaving Demichaelis/Kompany one-on-one with our strikers.",0,1397242783,null,0,false,0,cgq0b2o,t3_22sm7d,t1_cgq0b2o,t3_22sm7d,null,1433313125,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2
true,KChieFan16,null,null,"Fair rebuttal and I agree with your third paragraph somewhat. I'll even upvote it because it was written nicely. However, I disagree on a few grounds.

Maybe it runs ""deeper"" but that is incredibly relative. For fans who come from more impoverished/different backgrounds that look to football, albeit LFC, as an escape from the everyday trials and tribulations of their daily lives, who is to say that the team's success ""means more"" to another solely because of family history and memories. I think that characterization is overbroad and inaccurate in multiple ways. You cannot presume that just because you have been a fan for a longer period of time, the connection runs deeper. Again, the lawyer in me loves to draw analogies: You wouldn't say that an individual who has had grandfathers upon grandfathers fight in numerous World and Domestic Wars is anymore ""connected"" to such history then an individual who has devoted their life or a substantial amount of time in learning, appreciating, and advancing that subject. Familial ties are your connection and I am sure they are undoubtedly strong. But classifying those ties as more superior and deeper rooted than non-local interests is a blanket assumption that fails to take into account the subjectivity of fans. 

Then again, assuming you are local, your country operates on the assumption that familial ties have some significance in not only football, but governmental matters as well (you have a King and a Queen, we don't). Americans, such as myself, find it incredibly hard to understand how lineage should have any such importance. Merit should be based on the individual, not events that occurred well before his time that he had no control over.

9 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: 10 and, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. 11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? 12 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. 13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.

No planet or galaxy to save, no enormous stakes, just a single old man begging him not to die for him. But he had to anyway, because he's never met anyone who wasn't important - especially sweet old Wilf. In my own head canon, that was the moment Davros spoke of, when ""at the end of all things the Doctor's soul will be revealed."" It was revealed when he sacrificed himself for Wilf, thinking he might really die this time, and it was glorious.

Of course Atletico is a great team... first in La Liga, undefeated in Champions League, but have in mind that they play the whole season with practically the same starting eleven players. Their only meaningful sub is Cristian Rodríguez and Diego Ribas, which they bought only recently in January. While this cannot mean anything of course, it can surely be seen as a weakness somehow. Having to depend so greatly on the same eleven players for the whole season and to be in contention for the biggest trophies by the end of it, it must be down to 2 factors: 
1. Diego Simeone's brilliance as a coach and motivator and
2. Great amounts of luck in avoiding serious injuries to the players so far (except Diego Costa and Arda Turan recently, but they are all expected to play against Chelsea) 
While there is no denying of the tactical mastermind and coaching abilities of Diego Simeone (probably the most serious contender for the Coach of the Year award), i think that having Mourinho on our side, is more than a good match for him. Even so, with the experience of Jose and his unmatched desire for victory, tactical know-how... i firmly believe that Chelsea are in a much better position.

They are the ones that allowed the taliban to gain relevance and power. On the other side there's Iran who would love to gain influence over the country. The people they fund have tended to be the less nutty groups, but it's not like battle-hardened militias are ever going to be very good at running a country.

There is no way to fix the situation. We don't have the power to fix the worlds problems, that's the honest truth of it. No matter how rich or powerful we become, we can never solve all hunger or war. Some issues aren't as simple as throwing people or money at it.

The only things we can do is small-scale, try to promote education, freedom of press, women's rights, etc. We could also try to put more pressure on our so-called ""allies"" who are largely responsible for the mess that Afghanistan is in. Of course the truth is Pakistan and Saudi have far more power over us than we have over them. We support Pakistan out of fear of their nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands, we support Saudi Arabia because they help us launch sandbox wars in the region and produce a lot of oil.

Ultimately there's a reason why Karzai has decided not to run in the election. He's strictly a money-man and he sure as hell won't be around when the taliban come back to shit the country up again.

true,Andures,null,null,"I see it as an obstacle, but not exactly a failure. Take for example, two of Liverpool's brightest loanees: Borini and Suso. [The rest are excluded because they are either too old (Reina and Assaidi), not playing in the first division of their league (makes it difficult to judge their effectiveness against high level opponents), or not having made enough appearances either due to performance or injury (Ilori and Coates).]

While both are promising, it is arguable whether they are even capable deputies to the current first team. Borini's goal tally at Sunderland, all things considered, makes one wonder if he is really good enough to step into the place of the two highest scoring strikers in the league. Suso might be a little better, but considering Liverpool's need for an out-and-out right winger, he is also unlikely to become a first-team choice for a team that hopes to be challenging for the title annually. 

As we all know, such things are often hard to predict, yet that is what clubs will have to do in the age of FFP (unless you're United with their ridiculous income). Suso and Borini may very well have to make way in order for Liverpool to buy players who are a little more polished and suitable for their style than these two, and would you consider it a failure then, especially considering the fact that these two will definitely bring in lesser numbers than what Lukaku and Courtois will?

In the current climate where instant success becomes the expected norm rather than the outlier, it has become harder and harder for clubs with big academies to balance developing youngsters and buying good players. I am of the firm belief that a good academy should not only look to producing players good enough for the first team, but also producing young talent that can be sold off to smaller teams. Everyone knows that first team experience is great experience for younger players, and while their career might end up being away from the club of their youth, it will still be better than one spent sitting in the reserve squad waiting for matches in the Reserve League and (formerly) the NextGen games. It does not seem so wrong to me for big clubs to look at their academy as potential for income (and also balancing the trend of buying the best players of smaller clubs by creating a supply stream of young, cheap players suitable for these clubs.)

Some of the welfare reform ideas aren't necessarily bad, it's just they're implemented so badly because the focus is all on reducing cost and using ""tough love"" tactics rather than bettering peoples lives. 

Universal credit makes a lot of sense. The underoccupation deduction for social housing makes a lot of sense for new claims, but PIP is just some silly time-wasting exercise. It's the same as DLA, it's classic political rebranding. They're spending billions to essentially change the name of a benefit to a more right-wing-correct name. Why. 

The lesson to be learned is get someone actually competent in charge of the DWP, and focus on the actual matter at hand, which is helping people. Not slashing costs to the bone.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I'm not a lawyer myself but I am law student and it's all fresh in my mind so make of that what you will but:

In terms of the difference between a director and just having director as your title it really depends if you are registered as a director. There isn't really a helpful definition so you best bet I expect is to look at your service contract and also at the directors register which should be available for inspection at your registered office. Other than that it's worth looking at the companies Articles of Association which should explain the formalities involved in appointing directors and may give a better definition than in the Companies Act. If you are not a director you may be classed as a 'de facto director' meaning someone who does the same work as a director but isn't technically one in which case you will be treated in the same way as if you were a director. 

You can be removed by an ordinary resolution (&gt;50%) at the shareholders meeting [under s.168](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/168). If the other two shareholder hold more than 50% of the shares then that is perfectly possible. 

BUT they have to give 28 days notice before they hold the vote AND you have a right to protest your removal [under s.169](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/169) at the meeting AND after you are given notice you can send representations, or facts you think should be known before the vote, to the company and (provided the representations are concise and given in good time) the representations MUST be read out to the entire meeting. I don't know if you 3 are the only shareholders but if you are not then you might be able to persuade other shareholders to vote with you. Remember you work for the company and therefore all the shareholders collectively not the MD *in his capacity as MD*. He can't (I don't think) just fire you on the spot as MD - it must be done by shareholder's votes. In the case of a vote at a general meeting you have as much a right to vote against the motion as he does to vote in favour but you might be outvoted. 

**EDIT***: OK I just saw below that it looks like the MD is your only registered director which means presumably you could be fired with fewer protections. Obviously the more calm and tactfully you go about raising this with the MD will make your dismissal less likely. You might still be classed as a de facto director but that really depends on the work you do within the company and I don't really know how much that would protect you. What you need is the shares and your being a director (or not) is not particularly relevant to that. Everything below this edit relates to your rights as a shareholder not a director so is unrelated to rights as a director.*

In terms of your options in the future I would go about ~~(a): working out if you are registered as a director at your office~~ (b) Gather evidence of their promise to give you more shares and maybe try to get them to confirm it to you. Under s.994 of the Companies Act you can appeal to the court that the controlling shareholders are using their controlling stake to unfairly prejudice you. Unfair prejudice in this case would mean refusing to give the shares they promised. In previous cases the judges have said that the promise you can rely on in situations like this must be very clear, almost like an informal contract not just a hint that maybe you might get them but a clear informal promise. Under s.994 you can get the court to force the company to do pretty much anything - give you the shares your owed, buy out your current shares etc but you need evidence of that promise. And then (c) I suppose would be to try and avoid litigation where possible. Taking someone to court can be messy and expensive and will certainly sour the relationship between you. It may be that they just didn't realise you were worried or there might be some miscommunication. It sounds like you've been clear but it's worth a shot at fixing things without lawyer fees. Obviously it may be impossible to avoid and you shouldn't be afraid of taking a stand because I think, provided you have evidence of the promise and there aren't things I've missed, I think you stand a decent chance of being able to claim but obviously if you want proper professional advice (which this is definitely not) and if raising the issue internally gets you nowhere then see a lawyer and have them handle it. I can say I've studied cases just like this and there is a lot of precedent in this area so your lawyer is the only person who can give you properly reliable advice should be able to give you lots of help.

It doesn't necessarily mean more to us just because of our family history, there are plenty of people who come from die hard families that couldn't care less about football or LFC. What I'm saying is that there is a different, secondary relationship with the club that comes through the interconnections between the club, the supporters and their forebears. My stake in the present day Liverpool football club is no greater than yours and I would never claim that being from Liverpool makes me more invested in this season than someone who isn't. But the connection to the past is greater and simply a fundamental difference between older and newer fans, we feel a greater ownership because of the shared history between our families and the club.

Perhaps as you said it's simply a cultural difference and we place greater importance on our families roles in events than you do. For the record I would argue that having relatives involved in historical events does give a greater connection to them, but not a greater authority to speak on them, perhaps that is where we a confusing the issue.

true,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"As a fan of the Boston Red Sox I knew what Liverpool could expect from John Henry and his ownership team and that was a team dedicated to winning with the capacity to learn from their mistakes and to put together a product of the highest caliber both on and off the field. What I didn't anticipate was how difficult it would be for them to learn the intricacies of English football. Also don't be fooled by this season's success, there is still a lot of work to be done by the ownership before Liverpool can truly consider themselves an elite club again (I see it as a minimum of a 3 year project).

Also don't be blinded by transfer budgets, that is not an effective long-term strategy for success. Liverpool are looking to add pieces slowly over time for the right cost. Look at the past 3 years: Suarez, Sturridge, Sakho, Allen, Coutinho, Mignolet, and Enrique were all signed in addition to Sterling and Flanagan being promoted, if we sign and promote a similar number of players successfully over the next 3 years we will have a very competive team.

If we look at other transfers, players like Borini, Aspas, Ilori, Assaidi, Toure, Moses, and Cissokho, we can see a few players who didn't make the cut and will be sent packing and few who still might have succussful careers at Liverpool. However all of these transfers total around £25 million (not including any potential fees of players being sold by Liverpool) which for the collective services of all these players past, present and future is actually a pretty fair price. I believe Borini will become a 10+ goal/season striker (despite the general consensus on this forum), Aspas might leave this summer because he should be playing more regularly, Ilori could be a legitimately world-class CB to pair with the already world-class Sakho, Cissokho has been not terrible, Toure has provided another veteran head to the team chemistry as well as competent cover when needed (as long as he keeps the ball rolling away from our own net), however Moses will likely be put down at the end of the season, and last but not least Assaidi scored against Chelsea",0,1397251200,null,0,false,0,cgq43a0,t3_22rhoe,t1_cgq43a0,t3_22rhoe,null,1433314976,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I support this very much. This is Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. Every club once in a while fucks up themselves, but when we do it it's even worse as we have no luck. Forget this season for now, look at our last few. 2012 - semi-final FA Cup against Chelsea, gave a dodgy goal that didn't cross the line. Went to lose 5-1. What about that dodgy penalty in a man utd match a few years back where we were destined to win, but they caught us and turned a 2-0 half-time lead into a 5-2 defeat. And who else has tried forgetting the 2012 chelsea vs bayern final? We were solid 3rd, dropped to fourth and chelski fucked us up. We are a very unlucky side, but when we fuck up it always makes a bad situation worse. A good Champions League side needs to be both extremely tight and well disciplined, while having that bit of luck.

Do you have a source for this?

Also, points 2 and 3 aren't really relevant if the reason you're voting UKIP is not because you want them to govern. People vote UKIP because they want to abolish a specific level of governance, not put UKIP in charge of it. They're a protest vote. A way of working towards an ends, rather than earning a majority. 

***There's much better reasons to not vote UKIP.*** 

* Staying in Europe is fundamentally good for this country. 

* 2 million brits live in EU countries largely thanks to the freedom of movement guranteed by the EU. 

* all 60 million of us have the right to move to the EU whenever we please, which is particularly beneficial to the younger generation and will pay even huger dividend before long as these generations grow up having taken advantage of work opportunities and European networks which improve business and culture. 

* Adds an additional layer of democracy which is far superior to the UK system. For all the gripe the EU gets about being undemocratic, it is actually a much better system than the UK's. It has *two* elected chambers of Parliament (The Council of the European Union and the European Parliament) who together agree on who the effective president (core executive) will be. It also uses a reasonable voting system, where as the UK using FPTP which has leads to every single government between 1945 and 2010 governing with less than 50% of votes cast.

* Creates jobs.

* Creates economics growth (these two together mean that living standards rise)

* Entrenches human rights by making the signing of the European Convention on Human Rights a prerequisite to EU membership. I know the papers go on and on about who the ECHR is just plain awful because it means we can't send potential terrorists to be tortured and then murdered in Lebanon, but I'm rather old fashioned in that I think that you have human rights irrespective of your actions. Prison: yes. Death and torture: No. I'd hate to think the state we'd be in if we hadn't been forced to adhere to the Human Rights Act/ECHR. 

* Brought and continues to bring about peace in Europe (along with other transnational organisations like NATO).

* Incentivised and continues to incentivise all European countries to democratise, liberalise and improve quality of life for its citizens, using peaceful (usually economic) means. We tend to forget that the EU is one of the major reasons Greece, Spain and Portugal are no longer fascist dictatorships (Seriously, up until the seventies Spain and Portugal had genuine Fascist governments which were set up at the same time as Mussolini's and Hitler's). 

* We have more power at the bargaining table arguing from an EU perspective. Seriously, largest economy in the world carries some weight. Yeah, yeah I know ""I don't believe Britain is good enough"". How unpatriotic of me. Doesn't stop it being true and I'd rather not be blinded by nationalism, unlike some.

* We are fundamentally like our European neighbours, particularly those in the Wets (Germany, France, Netherlands, Ireland) but also those in the East (Poland, romania, Bulgaria) even if you don't want to admit it. We're all committed to social democracy in one form or another and we're all liberal. We all value education and we all have a positive (as oppose to negative, like in America) view of freedom. We all have integrally intertwined cultures and histories. Maybe if we learned more languages and had chances to really meet more people from Europe we'd realise just how similar we all are. 

I'm gonna stop writing. I could go into more detail or write more reasons, but then I'd be spending a lot more time here than I feel anybody would want to read. Feel free to quiz me on specific points and defend them with evidence/explanation.

I bought my ER-6n - it was about 15 months old and had 427 miles on it.
Turns out the owner had it, got injured at work and couldn't ride it and decided to sell it sooner rather than later in order to not lose too much money. Since it was already pre-registered by the dealer, it had 2 owners in 15 months. That meant that I got a practically brand new bike for about 2 grand off asking price. A free first service and I got to ensure that the bike was run in properly for the rest of it's run in period.

Obviously you want to ask why they're selling it and why it has such low mileage. If you're not happy with the answer, do an HPI check (probably worth doing one anyway). If you're still not happy, walk away.

Also it sort of depends how long you'll think you'll keep it for. If you're worried that it's been ragged, it'll probably only matter in the long term, not the next couple of years.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"UKIP are definitely not fascist. UKIP allegedly advocates liberty (they're libertarians) which is the ideology that fascism was built in opposition to. Though they certainly have a lot of old fashioned Conservatism in there as well. 

They also certainly try and come off as totally not racist, but that's because the racist demographic already votes for them. Once you've securely cornered a demographic it's very safe to start trying to alienate yourself from them to appeal to other voters, because that demographic isn't going to stop voting for you, but that can't vote for you twice if they *really* like you. This is why you see the Concervatives telling us how they are so totally not the party of the rich. They have cornered that demographic and can expand outwards. 

Additionally the party seems pretty evenly split between pro gay marriage and anti gay marriage. Farage is avoiding the issue like the straight talking politician he is and only saying that ""There'll be no gay marriage whilst we're under the EU"" (because the EU somehow ruins the idea of gay marriage because EU power, or something. It made no sense to me so I decided to use the brain power to remember other, more important things). 

So all in all it's pretty dissimilar to a Jew voting for the Nazis. The Nazis actually espoused anti-jewish rhetoric prior to the elections, but UKIP is pretty silent if not completely mute on the issue.

I will admit that having had about 9 hours to mull it over you and all the other people with your stance do have a point. But generating talk about a topic is still a good thing. If people are talking about a company, then unless they're talking about something that's specifically going to drive people away from the company (such as your STI analogy) then they are going to have it implanted into their subconscious mind. In this case, having a creepy puppet isn't something that would make me not want to use the company, and so when I need a payday loan (which, personally I hope is never) I'm going to think of the one that my subconscious first makes me think about, and if I've been in a conversation about Wonga's creepy puppets earlier, then I'm likely to think of Wonga immediately. Ergo, the creepy puppets have done their job.

Now, if I were to think of Wonga because they'd been in the news saying that the money people borrowed had been giving them STIs, then you're right, I would be unlikely to choose Wonga to be the company that saddles me with lifelong debt. But, as the conversation wasn't about nigh-on miraculous transfers of STIs via bank transactions, and instead about a creepy puppet which, unless you're stupid, won't dissuade you from using that company, then the creepy puppet has done its job.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"I like you're way of putting it, but whilst they certainly are as fascist as they are a part of the working class, that arguably makes them a better party of the working classes than any party we have at the moment. A lot of them only seem to be paying lip service to the anything below upper middle class, rather than anything serious. Ed Milibands come up with one or two good ideas, but not much. Farage's anti-establishmentness is arguably one of the best ways to help the working class at the moment (only it doesn't really work for UKIP because they and their leader are just as much part of the Westminster bubble as the rest, no matter how much they deny it).

I suppose what I am trying to say is, when all the current parties are as shite as they are, you can kind of understand why people vote UKIP. We need to move on from this ridiculous style of politician that wants to sell you an image of a prime minister rather than actual policies. The Westminster bubble is too distinct and we need to either change that, or come up with a way of dealing with the fact that the political elite of the country are not going to represent is in that they are *of* is but they represent us in that they represent our views. We need to make that move and start accepting that our leaders wont be the kind of people who like to have a good pint at the local pub on a Sunday.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Staying in Europe is fundamentally good for this country

&gt;Creates economics growth

&gt;Creates jobs

&gt;Creates economics growth (these two together mean that living standards rise)

These statements are so broad and baseless. How is EU political union creating economic growth and jobs exactly? You can't just spout ""muh jobs"" and expect to win a debate without backup evidence.

&gt;2 million Brits live in EU countries largely thanks to the freedom of movement guranteed by the EU.

Brits are also living abroad outside of Europe. We don't need political union to emigrate.

&gt;Adds an additional layer of democracy which is far superior to the UK system. For all the gripe the EU gets about being undemocratic, it is actually a much better system than the UK's. It has two elected chambers of Parliament (The Council of the European Union and the European Parliament) who together agree on who the effective president (core executive) will be. It also uses a reasonable voting system, where as the UK using FPTP which has leads to every single government between 1945 and 2010 governing with less than 50% of votes cast.

The president of the European Council was elected by his peers, not by the European people. The European Council passes EU laws, Coordinates economic policies of EU member countries, Signs agreements between the EU and other countries,
ppproves the annual EU budget, develops the EU's foreign and defense policies and coordinates law enforcement and judicial systems. Are you comfortable with this being handled by an unelected body?

[There are currently 766 MEPs elected in the European Parliament, 73 of which are British (9.5%).](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/map.html) We can easily be outvoted on anything which concerns the UK but not the rest of Europe.

&gt;Entrenches human rights by making the signing of the European Convention on Human Rights a prerequisite to EU membership. I know the papers go on and on about who the ECHR is just plain awful because it means we can't send potential terrorists to be tortured and then murdered in Lebanon, but I'm rather old fashioned in that I think that you have human rights irrespective of your actions. Prison: yes. Death and torture: No. I'd hate to think the state we'd be in if we hadn't been forced to adhere to the Human Rights Act/ECHR.

As I think you may know, the EU and ECHR are entirely different organisations. Leaving the EU does not exclude us from the ECHR. Whatever you may think about the ECHR, we would still be entitled to it, only it would be our choice to abide by it and it wouldn't be forced on us.

&gt;Brought and continues to bring about peace in Europe (along with other transnational organisations like NATO).

Increasing unemployment and the rise of extremist organisations will only lead to more violence. [There were violent union protests at Brussels not long ago](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/04/us-belgium-demonstration-idUSBREA3312K20140404) because of the high levels of unemployment which kind of throws your credible ""creates jobs"" argument out the window. You could also argue that the EU's colonialist attitude towards Ukraine provoked Russia into acting.

&gt;Incentivised and continues to incentivise all European countries to democratise, liberalise and improve quality of life for its citizens, using peaceful (usually economic) means. We tend to forget that the EU is one of the major reasons Greece, Spain and Portugal are no longer fascist dictatorships (Seriously, up until the seventies Spain and Portugal had genuine Fascist governments which were set up at the same time as Mussolini's and Hitler's).

All of which were democratically elected. You can argue all you like about how nasty you think certain leaders were, but it's what the people chose. When the Greeks were being bailed out their president was ousted and replaced by an EU unelected puppet. Hardly democratic. Local governments are perfectly capable of improving the quality of life of their citizens.

&gt;We have more power at the bargaining table arguing from an EU perspective. Seriously, largest economy in the world carries some weight. Yeah, yeah I know ""I don't believe Britain is good enough"". How unpatriotic of me. Doesn't stop it being true and I'd rather not be blinded by nationalism, unlike some.

We have less of a global voice being tied to the EU. If Iceland can negotiate a trade deal with China so can we, it's nothing to do with patriotism, but logical business sense.

&gt;We are fundamentally like our European neighbours, particularly those in the Wets (Germany, France, Netherlands, Ireland) but also those in the East (Poland, romania, Bulgaria) even if you don't want to admit it. We're all committed to social democracy in one form or another and we're all liberal. We all value education and we all have a positive (as oppose to negative, like in America) view of freedom. We all have integrally intertwined cultures and histories. Maybe if we learned more languages and had chances to really meet more people from Europe we'd realise just how similar we all are.

Touching but this has nothing to do with political union. We can still be friends with our neighbours outside of it.",1,1397263077,null,0,false,0,cgq8qp1,t3_22syq6,t1_cgq8qp1,t1_cgq6edn,null,1433317167,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

Everton have a long and proud history, but as for the here and now, here's some key points.

1. After a decade under David Moyes, Roberto Martinez was appointed our new manager in the summer. He's built on the foundation that Moyes left, and instilled a more positive, passing brand of football, while managing to keep the defensive strengths intact. He's also proven to be very tactically astute, and very adept at reading a game and making effective substitutions or tactical changes.

2. Key Players: Ross Barkley, Leighton Baines, Tim Howard, Romelu Lukaku, James McCarthy. Honestly our whole team is key players, we're so much better than the sum of our parts. Ross Barkley has been perhaps the surprise of the season though, as this is really his first year with any significant time and he looks to be a true superstar in the making.

3. We play our football at Goodison Park in Liverpool, one of the toughest places to play in England. Chelsea and Arsenal have left with nothing this season, and Liverpool barely managed to salvage a point.

4. We go by the Toffee's, Blues, School of Science, or The People's Club. You'll often see COYB, which stands for ""Come on you Blues!"", a rallying cry for the clubs supporters. Other chants that have been popular this season are Allez Allez Allez Oh and Oviedo Baby.

Money doesn't equal posh, it's how you conduct yourself that would determine it. For example:

You are a successful barrister, a QC let's say, with a 6 figure salary and a wife and 3 kids. You live on the Upper Malone Road and you drive a Range Rover, your wife has a Mercedes C-Class, and your oldest son has a Golf GTi despite only being 17 and just passed his test. You also have a holiday home in the Mediterranean somewhere (I dunno, on the Italian coast or something). You play golf and are a member of a country/golf club. You hang around with similar people and only drink fine Sauvingnon Blancs from New Zealand and whatever else. **THAT** is posh

Now imagine the same scenario; QC, wife &amp; 3 kids. Only instead of all of you having ridiculous cars, you drive a 7 year old volvo, your wife has a polo and your son has 3rd party insurance on that. You only holiday once a year, to modest surroundings, and you don't allow your kids to live off of your hardwork and graft. In that aspect, though you still make crazy money, you don't act posh.

Conversely, a ""poorer"" person can give off the image that they are posh, when they are in fact on a significantly lower wage.

Of course people with ""new"" money can become posh. Another example:

You come from a working class background, dad was a lorry driver, mum was a cleaner at a school or maybe unemployed. You're determined to succeed however, you do well in school, and your parents save up enough for you to go to Uni where you study medicine and come out with high marks, go on to become a consultant, earning 6-figures per annum, and BOOM, new money and new lifestyle which may result in you leading a posh lifestyle.

So, without trying to sound condescending, does *that* make sense?",0,1397266534,null,0,false,0,cgqa12q,t3_22tnf3,t1_cgqa12q,t1_cgq9sj3,null,1433317774,14,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,14

They would first call an hour before midday, then normally around 3, then normally in the evening around 7. It got to a point where we all knew answering the homephone would equal hearing some call centre worker asking to speak to someone for a survey etc.     
Eventually I convinced my Dad to buy an answer machine and to have long periods of time where the phone didn't ring audibly. People could call, and would get through to an answer machine, but we wouldn't hear the phone ringing. If their reason for calling was important they could leave a message and we could call them back when/if we wanted to.     
Within about 2 months of having this system in place we stopped getting calls from call centres altogether and there is little else that this can be put down to other than using an answer phone.    
And on top of this, if a specific company is calling your phone frequently - make an issue with them.

true,bainesy3,newcr-1,,"The briefest history of the club

1. Founded in 1878 as St Domingos for members of the local church. There was also a cricket and softball club if I recall correctly. 

2. Our home ground was Anfield but there was a dispute between owners and we moved to Goodison Park. This is how Liverpool, our rivals, were born. We played our last game at Anfield in 1892.

3. Dixie Dean played for us from 1925 to 1937. In the 27-28 season he scored a record 60 league goals, a record that has never been broken. He is widely regarded to be the best English player to grace the game. Little known fact, he was also a cracking baseball player.

4. Liverpool and Everton dominated the English game in the 80s and we've won the top division 9 times. Liverpool is the most successful city in terms of football trophies won, a huge accomplishment over the likes of Manchester and London.

5. Our last major trophy was the FA cup in 1995 when we beat Manchester United 1-0.

6. Throughout much of the 1990s our most famous player was big Duncan Ferguson. In 2001 he was burgled at his home in Liverpool. He caught one of them who ended up in hospital for three days. He's been convicted of assault a few times and went to prison for headbutting a player. At the moment he's a coach with us. 

7. David Moyes was our manager from 2002 to 2013 and brought us from near relegation to challenging for champions league qualification. When he managed us a lot of fans weren't keen on his negative, defensive tactics. When he left he tried to poach our top players and made dickhead comments about Everton being a small club or something like that. When we got Roberto Martinez no-one really knew what to expect. Some people even thought he'd get us relegated. But he's gotten us playing great football and we all love him. He's also done for us what Moyes never could and that's get a win at Old Trafford.

Man city and Chelsea have amazing youth teams. Check out how dominant Chelsea is in u18 level, even u21 level has mostly u18 players in it some days. The issue is your 19, your not an amazingly talented player but not shit. Someone like cork or betrand let's say. You aren't Chelsea level but your good enough to play against better teams.

 It's basically loans or bust. Coming into a new team isn't easy for young players. The gap from youth football to first team is much too high on the epl because you need results every week and most teams can beat the top 4 often enough that its not a assumed victory.

That and very few amazingly talented players have realistically come through in youth level. Been following Chelsea youth team since 07 I think. Since then the only stand out players I have seen have been weiss, sturridge, kakuta and wilshere. Just that wow factor and consistency in youth level, yet only two of them have really made it into top teams. 
Some matured later and others might not have been wow talents at junior level but their skills meant that when they stepped up to higher levels it carried over better.

Over the last two months there's been lots of improvements and updates to the browser. In addition, people have been putting out their own virtual reality content for this browser like the TARDIS here.

To visit this TARDIS:

* Download the recent release of FireBox [here](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/projects/firebox/)
* Read through the FAQ on that site about how to use FireBox.
* Open FireBox and have fun exploring. The very large door opens up a geocities of sorts where lots of people have their vr web page hosted.
* When you're bored, time to visit the TARDIS
* Press TAB and type in the URL - http://www.reddit.com/r/VRsites
* Left click on the door that appears to open it.
* In that subreddit, you should find the door leading to the Doctor Who TARDIS (I posted it today, but it is a Reddit room so the links will change location over time).

I'd say something similar about Thornton's. The quality is no better than supermarket ""taste the difference""-type ranges and they're a franchise.

true,fremeer,null,null,"He criticizes the fact that teams in epl aren't playing youth. And he says its cause of money.

And he is partly right but lots of the lack of English players in top teams is good English players are rare. 

Youth players aren't given a good ground to improve, they basically can't get into a team at 19 and are forced to go on loan. Loans aren't ideal for youth players.
Suddenly they are 22 and haven't improved nearly as much as players that are playing are weaker clubs.
If you could get players like t.hazard, chalobah, Mceachran, Kane, Clifford etc. the players that aren't necessarily ready for top level but very good and give them 30 games against teams of quality players at a level at or above their abilities they will improve much more. Possibly enough to be able to be used. Then maybe you will have teams deciding to buy English or retain youth. 

Another issue is players from overseas are generally cheaper and on lower wages.

true,darksurfer,null,null,"I think the high street will become integrated with the internet.

Small, niche shops will stay alive by selling globally via the internet (although currently, small businesses are mostly appalling at exploiting the potential of the web).

Large chains will compete by having shops as physical counterparts to their online presence. 

It's not hard to imagine completely un-manned shops that essentially work like vending machines. You're automatically identified as you enter the shop and are automatically billed for anything you take out of the shop (it would be possible to detect situations where you try to, for example, eat food inside the shop to avoid paying. Businesses based on hiring things (tools, sports equipment etc) might also use the same model.

One major thing that might affect this is that ""delivery"" is likely to become much, much more efficient and competitive. We're currently still just about impressed by next day delivery. 5 years from now (especially with Amazon Prime Air) we'll expect free delivery of many items within 30 minutes !, ""next day"" will only cut it for obscure items.

The tightness of money is only a temporary situation caused by us still being trapped in a 20th century economic paradigm. Once we get over that, what will do well are ""human centred services"". Meeting places (pubs, restaurants, cafes),  health &amp; beauty therapies, entertainments etc.

It feels more like the hunger to win was never there in the first place, as opposed to the team slumping to a string of poor results.

I will say however that Harry has been in the game for almost all his life, and has become very rich off of it - he is still the 26th best paid manager in the world. If he hasn't developed a thick skin by now I'd be a little surprised. He sticks to his guns so resolutely that I'd guess he handles the pressure pretty well. Moreover I would be shocked to learn he actually gave a toss if ASR decided they wouldn't be renewing their deal to have their brand plastered on Richard Dunne's back next year. I'd say QPR is relatively lucky in that we may not face the same headaches around those kinds of business issues as other clubs - whatever their failings at QPR, the likes of Fernandes, Beard and the Mittal clan have a decent mix of reputation, contacts and business acumen.

His rap sheet is pretty extensive for me now as well - exiled Faurlin, made Mackie leave, stacked the team with his own, failed to survive in the top flight, wasted time on trying to sign Bridge, Parker, Hooper et al., failing to sign enough firepower, glacial wingback formations, overlooking the club's own youngsters, loans loans loans, indifferent interviews, and at the end of it all the evidence appears to indicate the team won't be promoted this year either. For me that wouldn't be so bad. However Harry should be judged by measuring the clubs on-field success against the relative jangling of coins in his pocket.

true,practically_floored,newcr-1,,"Glad you chose the Blues! This is copied and pasted from a comment I made a few months ago:

Moyes, who was our manager for 11 years, moved to United and is doing pretty badly. They're currently 7th, below us and look likely to finish there for the first time ever. We got Roberto Martinez as our new manager who basically all Evertonians have fallen in love with, he has us playing possession and short passing football, which can be amazing to watch when we're at our best. We beat United at Old Trafford for the first time in 21 years and held Arsenal to a draw at the Emirates in the same week, which was pretty good.

Players to watch out for:

**Ross Barkley** - from our own academy, this is his debut season in our starting 11 and he is amazing. Best talent we've had since Rooney. He's having a dip after coming back from an injury (broken toe) but looked himself again in our last game. Some examples - [a beautiful free kick vs Swansea](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8qWLvfiqbyA/UrckE7eF-NI/AAAAAAAABH4/iY9ojhD_wCc/s0/22-12-2013-GifNumber-15.gif) and his [Goal vs Norwich.](http://gfycat.com/EvilParchedLabradorretriever)

**Seamus Coleman** - has been a solid right back for years but really stepped up this season. Said Martinez gave him the confidence to make shots on goal, and as a result he has scored some belters. Some examples - [his goal vs QPR](http://gfycat.com/TameDeadAzurewingedmagpie) and his [amazing strike vs Swansea.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QEXoPIqFny8/Urcfxr0puGI/AAAAAAAABHg/yI7EmDaT16Y/s0/22-12-2013-GifNumber-13.gif)

**Leighton Baines** - United tried to buy him in the summer but failed, and he just signed a new contract for us instead. One of the best left backs in the league (if not the best), also our set piece specialist. He scored two free kicks in our first game against West Ham, either side of the goalie - [1](http://gfycat.com/LimpRectangularAurochs) [2](http://gfycat.com/NauticalPeacefulHoneybadger)

**Kevin Mirallas** - can be a little greedy with the ball, but worth a shout just for his partnership he's forming with Baines over free kicks - scored [this beauty](http://gfycat.com/HorribleAdventurousIridescentshark) last month and tends to take free kicks on the left, while Baines takes them on the right.

Honourable mention to **James McCarthy**, another Irish international that we signed this summer and he is a brilliant player. Not scored for us yet but is so solid in midfield that it allows Baines and Coleman to come forward and score goals. We have a few good loan signings this season too, **Gareth Barry** from City, likely to sign in the summer as he's a free agent. Quality player. **Gerard Deulofeu**, 19 year old from Barcelona, looks set to be a fantastic player although has his faults, looks likely that we'll get him back on loan next season. **Romelu Lukaku**, striker from Chelsea, 20 years old and our top scorer. Has good and bad points, but is a great player while we've got him. 

Finally, I personally love **John Stones**, our 19 year old 3rd choice centre back. Jagielka and Distin are a great pairing, and keep him out of the squad normally, but when he gets the chance to play as centre back he's been great every time, really an exciting prospect for the future.

Sure, its (slightly) more expensive to internet shop this way, but its worth it to not to have to trawl round Sainsbury's. No amount of free parking or tax-rebates is going to compete with that. 

If the councils have done anything wrong it is the approval of large, out of town supermarkets with all that free parking and low tax that you seem so keen on.

Anyway... One thing... Tiny, tiny grumble... It might be just me, but I can't *stand* the use of ""BPL"" as an abbreviation of ""Barclays Premier League"".  Being British first, and English second, my brain instinctively reaches for ""British Premier League"" when I see ""BPL"", which would be wrong.  

I don't mind ""EPL"" for English Premier League as much, especially as the BBC so often say ""SPL"" when speaking of the Scottish Premier League, and it makes me smile as they would never say ""EPL"" in the same way but that just shows a cultural bias I think.

But really, it's just the PL.  Who knows, when the contract with Barclays Bank expires and another corporate takes over are you going to start calling it the ""HPL"" if Heinz takes over the sponsorship, or ""PPL"" if Pepsi Co takes over?

Anyway... Enough of my moaning on like Grandpa Simpson.

Reduce the number of people to increase the movement needed to avoid the two players. You'll notice the passing is quick but movement is static.

Everyone who's done these exercises knows this. You start off with large squares then smaller and smaller squares and with varying numbers of people. It's extremely tough and very tough (especially when the area is big) on the players in the middle. Which is why at a large area you increase the number of players in the middle if you're working on keeping the ball rather than fitness of players pressing.

In this case the area is deliberately set out and thin in this case and the aim is largely to go from one side to the other. My problem with this drill is that the players are completely static. I'd rather we practised more on the movement than the passing under press. The passing under press has served us well in big games but the close quarters movement has been very lackluster.

Mourinho is not going to make the same mistake by putting Schurrle up top, now, do you chance it by putting Schurrle wide or keep it safe with Willian? As this is the first leg, I believe Mourinho will take the cautious approach and stick with Willian. This is obviously assuming Hazard can go.

The midfield pairing will probably be Luiz and Ramires. If Mourinho decides to play a more defensive game, I can see Willian sliding in the middle for a 433 with Schurrle wide.

Both teams will get get chances, and a few counter opportunities. It will just come down to who can capitalize on those chances or who gets the lucky bounce of the ball.

Loyalty to Rome isn't an issue in the Catholic world today, because of the geopolitical differences. Catholics aren't radicalized when it comes to international politics. The Vatican isn't making political demands on Catholics around the world, and it isn't embroiled in a nasty colonial campaign it constantly needs Catholics to defend, cover up for and lend support from overseas. But a few hundred years ago, this certainly was a parallel concern. We had radicalized Catholics attempting to blow up Parliament.

&gt; Spurs are said to be frustrated with van Gaal's failure to agree a deal with them, but United's interest would explain why the 62-year-old has been reluctant to commit to the White Hart Lane job.

I mean fuck off. No intelligent manager who has thrown his hat in the ring for any of up to 3 or 4 possible PL openings would take a job before the season ended, especially if they couldn't work with the team until almost 4 months later. It's ridiculous.

I mean, sure, everyone at the club would probably love for LvG to offer to sign a contract so they could sack sherwood at season's end, but the truth is that that would never happen. Just like if this meeting really happened, I'm sure United would have liked to have him sign a contract so they could do the same to Moyes.

Truth is, I still have my doubts that United will even sack Moyes. He's a good manager that got a squad that *way* overperformed under Sir Alex...because Fergie was that good. Moyes is good, but he isn't Fergie good. And most clubs would do well to recognize by now that you need to give a manager time to build the squad to your liking and instill your system.

Some managers, like Sherwood, aren't worth waiting for because they're inexperienced and have no system. 

But Moyes is experienced - he has lots - and I just don't see United, the bastion of consistency and tenure in the PL to get rid of Moyes so soon. Especially since the club is quite wealthy and can replenish their squad more quickly than Spurs could, for example.

I'd love to see United falter to the point of becoming a perennial mid-table team.

the European council is not an unelected body, since it is composed of the elected head of government of every member of the EU.

it also passes no laws, since it has no legislative power, its purpose is to define the political direction of the Union, and the job of the President of the council is to chair the meetings of the members of the council.

true,anonymousee1,null,null,"Is Baker good enough for Villa: I think defensively we have improved this season and if we're targetting mid table i'd say he is good enough. But not anything higher than that.

Has he improved since he became a regular: Definitely

How can he further improve: A centre back should score a couple of goals a season, he hasn't done that. Defensively, marking is a real issue, he has a tendancy to lose track of his man, particularly  on crosses and set pieces. 

In what defensive setup does he fit best: Definitely 4-4-2. I'm of the opinion that Vlaar is the best CB at the club, and as a result I think Baker and any other CB works best when they have Vlaar playing next to them. Everyone in the back four just seems more confident and less error prone when Vlaar is playing

Do you think inexperience is an excuse for frequent mistakes: When you're in the bottom half frequent mistakes are a given. I do think it's an excuse and with age consistency usually increases (unless you're Fernando Torres). 

Next few seasons: I think it depends largely on the fitness of the other CB's. If Clark, Vlaar and Okore are fit for most of the next few seasons he might have a tough time. Especially if Okore lives up to his potential. Lambert seems to prefer bringing his own players in. About half of a typical starting lineup will consist of players he's brought in, rather than players who were there when he arrived. Lambert doesn't seem to have much patience with players that weren't his own buys. If Lambert signs another centre back in the summer I'd fear for Baker's future.

true,ninj3,null,null,"Oxford is the better one ;D just kidding. I think Cambridge is actually the prettier town for first time tourists. But Oxford is, in my opinion, the better city for further exploration and living in.

Aside from visiting the most beautiful colleges and parks as usual, the most quintessential oxbridge thing you *must* do when visiting either is [punting](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_%28boat%29). Especially now that the weather is finally improving.

Punting is kind of difficult at first, but it's a really nice, relaxed way to spend an afternoon on the beautiful rivers of both cities. 

The reason I say that Cambridge is prettier, is that many of their fanciest colleges are set against the river which makes it a very beautiful, touristic journey for punting. Because of its popularity, you can hire punter tour guides to punt you down the river and tell you about each college and bridge you pass by. If you punt yourself, the river is straight, bottomed with stones in most places and has specific start and end points that you cannot pass. This makes it easier to punt, but also quite short and linear, without freedom to explore. It's also very crowded most of the time.

Oxford on the other hand has a much more ""wild"" river. There are many twists and turns and branched paths. You are allowed to punt pretty much anywhere (where the river is shallow enough, which is a lot). You'll need a map to find your way.

There are two main punting stations: One at the [Magdalen bridge](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview?q=magdalen+bridge+boat+house) near the city centre. This one is generally most popular with tourists just passing through. As you can see on the map, there are lots of routes you can take so it's fun exploring the area. Punt traffic can sometimes be an issue here with inexperienced punters getting stuck and blocking the path. Much of the time this can lead to pretty hilarious results.

However, the better one, the one I recommend, is slightly further north at the [Cherwell boathouse](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview?q=cherwell+boathouse). This one is less crowded as it's further from the city centre and the river is wider and more relaxing to punt on. What I always tell people to do, is take the punt from here and head directly north. Follow the river until you reach the [Victoria Arms pub](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview?q=victoria+arms+marston), which is about 30-45 minutes punt away. The pub is backed directly to the river so you can just tie up your punt here and enjoy some drinks and a meal at the pub. They've got a huge grassy garden space. I do this every time I have visitors and they love it! Great for a date, but also very enjoyable for families.

Oh, if you do try punting yourself, make sure you have a read of [punting technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_%28boat%29#Punting_technique). You'll need it!",0,1397301420,null,0,false,0,cgqid2q,t3_22pwsj,t1_cgqid2q,t1_cgq9a3d,null,1433321832,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"&gt;This is just a fun exercise on technical skills that has nothing to do with tactics or positioning.

Firstly I didn't say it was to do with tactics or positioning. It's to do with mentality on the pitch. Our mentality is to keep the ball under pressure, fine, our mentality is also to be very rigid.

Natural pass and move isn't to really to do with positioning. Free form attacking and interplay between AMs and forwards is not really about learning specific positioning it's about learning to move into space and playing high order passes over a short distance. The keep ball exercise, of which this is a variation is something of a favourite of Pep's, particularly in ever decreasing sizes of square with small group sizes. And his extensive focus on it is something that shows quite a lot in his squads ability to keep hold of the ball and continue to move with it. He is far less focused on individual positioning and countering opposition tactical movement into space. Hence his best defence is to keep the ball. 

Technical skills could be a bit of a misnomer here. It's primarily focusing on reactionary passing and speed not just technical skills as a blanket for anything non-tactical. Technical skills coaching could equally be more like the coaching of all of our defence to do the fake pass step think that became highly prevalent last season.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; What? Ten years of above average growth? 

Built on dodgy credit and quicksand, evidently. Not sure how above average ""growth"" is a good thing when it is followed by years of recession and stagnation (despite that economics savant, Gordon Brown declaring an end to boom and bust). I'm glad that an entire generation of people will be stuck renting because of the property boom engineered by the Labour government (and unfortunately continued by this government)

&gt;  Growth that was followed by a worldwide recession

Are you Brown or just a Labour supporter? A worldwide recession, yes, but up to that time London was the leading financial centre. Who regulates London? Ah, ultimately the UK government and the Bank of England, with the finance minister setting policy. I can see now why Brown is blameless, he only had control over the key financial centre of the world. ""An end to boom and bust"" indeed.

&gt; If you're angry about the deregulation of the financial sector that led to the recession, that's understandable, but lets not pretend the Tories were actually against this move.

Deflection. Were the Conservatives in power then? No. So what they might or might not have done is irrelevant.

&gt; And even when Labour were at their worst moment in the last 13 years, with the haunting shadows of the credit crunch, creeping privatisation and Iraq beginning to catch up with them, the Conservatives still could not get a majority. Doesn't that tell you something about their legacy.

Number of votes for Labour in 2005: 9,552,436

Number of votes for the Conservatives in 2010: 10,703,654

% of vote for Labour in 2005: 35.2%

% of vote for the Conservatives in 2010: 36.1%

Unless you're Brown himself and patently rubbish with numbers, you should be able to see that the Conservatives achieved more of the vote and more votes than Labour did. The fact that the Conservatives didn't achieve a majority in our broken electoral system despite getting more votes is simply a condemnation of FPTP. But it won't stop Labour supporters crowing on about ""no majorities"" and ""unelected prime ministers"".

All of the points you raise are textbook examples of the whitewashing and rehabilitation of Brown and Labour that some people seem to be engaged in, and so soon after the electoral defeat.

You are correct that there literally are SOME instances where it's publicity you don't want, but they are very few and far between. Even all the times companies get nailed on social media websites that go viral like Reddit, Twitter etc, what ACTUALLY happens? Momentary dip is sales maybe, momentary rise in complaints and then you move on. Everyone remembers your name though.

Your Garry's incident point disproves what you've said more than anything. If it gets a load of publicity for being shit and has no impact on sales, then it clearly shows that the publicity (for being shit) has managed to get it's name known without actually turning people away from the product (which was your argument).

If you insist I could talk about losing sovereignty.

The freedom of movement does put a strain on certain EU members because some EU members get more EU immigration than others. However this is always more of a benefit to the country which is receiving the immigration and the negatives are even further outweighed by fact that many people from that member state also live in other EU states. 

The EU can be wasteful with money. The amount of expenses MEPs can claim is a bit ridiculous and wasteful, and UKIP love to illustrate this by stealing as much of it as possible. However, Westminster MPs are much worse for this and have the ability to steal far more money, and they do.

Frankly if you don't know about South American history you probably shouldn't comment on it. I think there is a willful ignorance in that when this issues pops up time and time again Britain seems to ignore the historical and social context of the continent, particularly it's feelings towards colonisation. I'd suggest reading up on the concept of (and I apologise for the poor translation here) pyramid history, which discusses exactly how your perspective of historical debates, issues, whatever is affected by where in a pyramid your country stands. Britain has a top-down perspective, countries like Argentina a bottom-up, which makes it very difficult to see this issue eye to eye.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"&gt;The president of the European Council was elected by his peers, not by the European people. The European Council passes EU laws, Coordinates economic policies of EU member countries, Signs agreements between the EU and other countries, ppproves the annual EU budget, develops the EU's foreign and defense policies and coordinates law enforcement and judicial systems. Are you comfortable with this being handled by an unelected body?

You're talking about the entirely wrong institution there. The head of the Council of the European Union (currently Herman Van Rompuy) does non of those things. The person who does do all of those things is Borroso, and he is the president of the European Commission. He is not elected by his peers but is elected (or will be as of the coming European elections in May) by both of the elected houses of parliament in the EU. He will be proposed by the Council of the European Union which is made up of the heads of member states' governments (So Angela Merkel, Cameron, Hollande, et cetera) and the European Parliament which is directly elected. 

This is the first time the president of the Commission will be decided this way because it's the first time we've had a European election since the Lisbon Treaty came into effect.

The President of the Council of the European Union has almost no power whatsoever. He is merely a figure head elected by the Council of the European Union in order to represent the Council of the European itself (not the EU itself) usually to the rest of the EU, because all the other members of the Council of the European Union are heads of government and therefor have important countries to be running and no time to represent the CEU.

&gt;These statements are so broad and baseless. How is EU political union creating economic growth and jobs exactly? You can't just spout ""muh jobs"" and expect to win a debate without backup evidence.

Increased trade directly leads to economic growth. It's one of the first lessons of Macro economics. The EU is primarily a free trade organisation and so creates a lot of free trade which wouldn't be there otherwise. Then, because of that trade and and that economic growth companies like Siemens come to the UK to build cars and export them to Europe and the UK (creating jobs in the process). Siemens among many others have said they would pull out if the UK if the UK pulled out of Europe.

&gt; rits are also living abroad outside of Europe. We don't need political union to emigrate.

If you look at one Poland joined in 2004 we've had a 10 fold increase in the number of poles living in the UK. The same has been true of all other EU countries in reverse (UK citizens going to live there)(although never in such huge numbers).

&gt; Whilst we usually can live and work where ever we want in most of the World, it can be hugely difficult and expensive which makes it effectively impossible even though it is legally acceptable. For instance all EU countries would need you to prove that you can speak the language before allowing you to move there to work, but if you can't move there to work how are you going to learn the language? 

There wouldn't be 1 million UK pensioners living in Spain if not for the EU.

&gt; As I think you may know, the EU and ECHR are entirely different organisations. Leaving the EU does not exclude us from the ECHR. Whatever you may think about the ECHR, we would still be entitled to it, only it would be our choice to abide by it and it wouldn't be forced on us.

I'm aware they are separate and I thought I made that quite clear in the post. The European Convention on Human Rights is a treaty established by the Council of Europe (completely distinct body from the EU) which all signatories later wrote into their own domestic law.

However many UK governments have expressed their desire to leave the ECHR in the past. Teresa May actually said that we would leave it, even though that's impossible because of the ECHR relationship to the EU which already pointed out. If we left the EU we would leave the ECHR before long and human rights would become much weaker in this country.

I suppose I am trying to say that I don't trust are governments to care for everyone within this country, and if you look at its foreign policy and the attitudes its had towards extraditions, you can't blame me.

&gt; Increasing unemployment and the rise of extremist organisations will only lead to more violence. There were violent union protests at Brussels not long ago because of the high levels of unemployment which kind of throws your credible ""creates jobs"" argument out the window. You could also argue that the EU's colonialist attitude towards Ukraine provoked Russia into acting.

The extremists and the protests are a short term result of a short term problem. The financial crisis also has very little to do with the EU. Sure the Eurozone exacerbated the sovereign debt crisis, but it didn't cause it and it didn't even exacerbate it much. The only thing the EU is doing is saying that you can't deflate the problem away by printing money. EU countries actually have to (shockingly) deal with their financial problems. They'd be in the exact same situation whether the EU was there or not.
Additionally, when I say peace in Europe I'm not talking about protests. I'm talking about war like in World War I, World War II or in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Yugoslavia is the only war to break out on the European continent since the end of World War Two, and the damages of that crisis were significantly subverted by the European Union who ensured that the country of Slovenia could leave peacefully. The the trade, the cooperation and the interdependence is the reason for that. Protests will happen and they will happen again because the EU is not going to try and subvert protests, but there is never going to be a war between two EU member states.

&gt;All of which were democratically elected. You can argue all you like about how nasty you think certain leaders were, but it's what the people chose.

**No they bloody weren't**

Spain and Portugal hadn't had elections since the 1930s because they had fascist governments. Additionally, a lot of Eastern European countries had appalling voter freud which effectively made their democracies a sham, that the ruling elite used to pretend that they were democratic but weren't. Did you know that North Korea is allegedly democratic? Yeah, you can go into a private booth and vote for whichever Kim is in power at the moment or you can go into a class box and vote for someone else, whereupon you are shot dead. Democracy? I think not.

You're really overstating how advanced European democracy was before the EU came around. It was largely only the core countries which had it. Southern and WEstern Europe weren't looking so good.

&gt; We have less of a global voice being tied to the EU. If Iceland can negotiate a trade deal with China so can we, it's nothing to do with patriotism, but logical business sense.

Just because Iceland did make a trade deal with China doesn't mean it is any could. Nobody is saying that we couldn't make a trade deal with whoever we want, it's just that all the terms would be super beneficial to the larger player which is why Iceland's trade deal with China is really crappy compared to any EU one.

true,kinners,null,null,"That's a really interesting perspective. I think it helps explain a little bit about what's wrong with the team at the moment regarding their poor form. Redknapp is evidently excellent at handling the circus of a modern football club - he's a survivor. More often than not he's a winner too, but even when he fails he doesn't self-destruct. He exudes confidence, which must help hold a club together when there are cracks appearing at all levels of the infrastructure.

The downside of all that is that while those qualities are essential for a long career in football management, they've nothing to do with football. Redknapp's game management of late has gone from the bad to the ridiculous. He changes the lineup (and often the formation/style of play) every game, yet it's wrong every single time. He doesn't appear to study the opposition, often playing into their hands. One single example is the way he always seems to leave hoilett out against teams who field an organised lineup to frustrate us, even though hoilett's great strength is that he pulls players out of position - then starts him against teams against whom a short passing is the correct option (and he wastes possession and ruins patient approach play). Another is the way in which he persists with the same exhausted back line that's been shipping goals for months. 

As many fans will remember, however, QPR have had many decent football managers who haven't been able to handle the demands of the club off the pitch. Paulo Sousa springs to mind - clearly a smart guy and a decent tactician, but fell foul of the politics of the Briatore regime (when Dex was sold to forest while Sousa was on holiday, if memory serves).

The Liver bird also forms part of the logo of the University of Liverpool, its Medical Students Society, Liverpool John Moores University and Edge Hill University. The Liverpool Echo also has a slightly altered version of the Liver bird featured on Liverpool F.C.'s emblem on its front page, the differences being it is drawn slightly rounder and carrying a rolled up newspaper instead of a branch.

They seem to be doing very well - because their service is good, the prices are reasonable (my brother bought a TV from there last week, apparently it's cheaper than Amazon), they throw in warranties, offer free delivery and actually have a local repair shop rather than expecting you to send the thing hundreds of miles away - basically the antithesis of Currys/Comet/their ilk. I'm not sure what Appliances direct and friends would do if you need a repair. We've bought stuff from them but it hasn't broken yet.

No reason why I'd need to use appliances direct when I can go there and buy the thing and get it delivered same-day (or just take it myself)",0,1397307010,null,0,false,0,cgqjbw8,t3_22tcol,t1_cgqjbw8,t1_cgqhr13,null,1433322291,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;It isn't the Government's problem to intervene in the housing market

I disagree wholeheartedly. The housing market in London is failing. That is against liberal ideology which all of the mainstream parties claim to espouse.

&gt;In a free market, both labour and capital would receive the greatest possible reward, **while production would be organised efficiently to meet consumer demand.**

Constraining supply by collecting incorrect immigration statistics and then deliberately restricting government powers to remedy the situation, together can be considered to be market manipulation and direct government involvement in the markets. By doing nothing, they are manipulating the housing market. It is a failure of our government and institutions that we are short on housing. This has not been a sudden change but a long-term trend of inactivity for the benefit of land owners (who tend to be politically connected...). There are a lack of incentives to raise housing density except in the very high-end parts of the market, which are already adequately served.

&gt;where they do (with 'right to buy' selling off council housing at below-market rates and its offspring 'help to buy' encouraging an overheating property market) they simply make things worse.

Right to Buy and Help to Buy were both vote-buying policies. Both were overt manipulations of the housing market. Right to Buy had a far greater impact on the market and at least had ideological groundings.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt;  If you walk or cycle you are much more likely to pop into a local shop and pay a premium for convenience.

Not everyone has that option. I live in a village. If you want to go anywhere at all, not even for shopping, you have to spend 7 quid on the bus to get to the nearest town, or you drive. You won't be walking or cycling on the dual carriageway. Most of this county is the same way.

Therefore good parking is essential. The council here is just as bad as the rest at using parking as a revenue stream. One of the towns near me has a new private car park built and owned by a former car dealership that moved out of town. They are next to a council car park, they charge next to fuck-all for parking (it's like 30p for an hour), and it's always very busy (so is the town centre). The council car park is not as busy.

&gt; In a country as crowded as ours we shouldn't be wasting even more space on parking which could be used for housing or industry. It is reasonable to ask people to pay for the space they use.

true,gary1994,rory,Rory,"I think that the ""Moment"" has had a much bigger role to play in Clara's story than has been let on.   If the Doctor and Clara went to his tomb on Tranzalore, why didn't the Tardis recognize the planet when the Doctor returned in ""The Time of the Doctor?""  Even if you argue that the planets surface had been too radically altered by the war to be recognized I would have still expected the Tardis to make the connection from other attributes of the system.  The size and mass of the sun, the mass and orbits of other planets in the system, and the mass of Tranzalore itself.  

I think the easiest explanation is that the two planets were not the same.  I think that the ""Tranzalore"" that had the Doctor's grave on it was a fake created by the ""Moment"" and that it leaked its location to the Great Intelligence.  I think it's goal was to create the ""Impossible Girl"" and that that will be one of it's main methods of intervening in the Time War.

I don't believe that the ""Moment"" was a big bomb as was suggested by it's title the ""Galaxy Eater.""  I think it's true nature is more like the ""Bad Wolf"" version of Rose, but with the cognitive capacity to make full and subtle use of the power.  I think that it would attempt to hide it's hand in things as much as possible to avoid creating fear in the other races.  

It was mentioned in ""They Asylum of the Daleks"" that they had grown stronger in fear of the Doctor.  River also told the Doctor that ""all this was done in fear of you"" after the battle of Demon's Run.  I think the ""Moment"" is able to see the danger that raw displays of it's power would bring. So it will try to intervene as little as possible, employing or creating, cat's paws to influence the course of the war.  It wouldn't surprise me at all if the ""Moment"" had intervened in Clara's timeline at other points as well.  Who gave Clara the Doctor's phone number again?  Why did they make such a big deal about the leaf?

true,gary1994,rory,Rory,"A lot of people keep bringing up Capaldi's age as a reason for him and Clara not to be romantically involved.  But in my own life it has gotten much easier for me to attract women in their early 20s as I have gotten older (40 now).  The more I think about it, the more I think that it would actually be more likely for Clara to become more interested in the Doctor, his age giving him a greater air of authority and dignity.  

The two possibilities that I could see throwing that off would be an old and feeble Doctor or a Doctor who's character has changed radically.  Nothing I have seen of Capaldi suggests that his version of the Doctor will be feeble and I think that if the Doctor's character were to change so much that Clara did not recognize him as the Doctor neither would the fans, and lot of people would stop watching.

Now having said all this, I fully understand that many people have a prejudice against older men dating much younger women and that it is quite likely that the writers feel it as well.  I just think that the natural progression of the story is for the two to back off a bit while they figure out who the new Doctor is and then for things to begin to heat up again.  To be honest I would expect Clara to be the aggressor, in her own subtle ways.

I came in with new Who and Rose so romance has always been a part of the show as I have known it.  I really don't understand why people object to it so much.  Is it the role that they feel the Doctor should play?  Do they feel like he should be limited to being a father, teacher, or mentor figure?  One of the things that I have really liked about the Doctor is that he seems to be more than just a role, but a full man.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The reason for growing global inequality, as presented by numerous left and right wing scholars (such as Thomas Pinketty in his recent book ""Capital in the 21st Century"") is that invested wealth tends generally to outperform earnings, in the sense that money put into the stock market increases faster than wages. 

There are multiple solutions to this, (indeed Pinketty paints a picture of a dystopian future and says the only solution is an untenable global wealth tax), but to my evil capitalist brain, the answer is clear:  

**If workers own more and more stock in the companies they work for, then they too can share more in capital gains, and increases in share price.  In essence, the solution is to give workers more capital so that they too can (to put it simplistically) 'become capitalists' and share in economic growth.**

For a long time, owning a house was only for the rich.

Weimann on the bench - fair enough. Missed so many chances last couple of weeks and dropping him several months overdue. But he could easily have gone 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 by picking Albrighton.


Every time we play ""3-5-2"" we end up camped in our own box and unable to get out because we have nobody to pass to. The full backs never turn into wing backs or midfielders they just sit deep. An enormous gap appears between our midfield and the strikers and the only way to play is the long ball. Palace would LOVE to face the long ball.


I understand Lambert wants to improve the defence after recent weeks but seriously, that's such a lack of ambition and it makes our attack so blunt. This game is only going to have 1 pattern. All Palace, with Villa possibly having the odd chance through Agbonlahor off a long ball.

It's clear that ""the public"" want to use cars to go shopping - not everyone can walk to the shops or get a bus (which are subsidised too, in many cases) or train (definitely subsidised), it's either not an option at all or impractical enough for people to not bother. Instead, they'll just go to Amazon or eBay on their computers at home, or the out of town shopping centres - which is what they are doing, hence the woes our high streets are experiencing.

Are you aware of the costs of running a council park (no, I don't either)? I'm not sure what the problem is with free parking, even if subsidised. Lots of things are subsidised, including public transport. But it's apparent that it's clearly much cheaper than the prices suggest - if a private operator in the town near me is able to charge 30 or 40p/hour rather than the 1.20 the council wants across the road.

I get the idea that you're someone who doesn't drive and/or is in a position to easily walk or use a subsidised bus/train to the shops.

As for the match, I'm bricking it to be honest haha. Although I'm usually a pessimist when it comes to football, so that's nothing new. Even Cardiff scared the shite out of me before kickoff. I can see the match going either way; I don't see either team as favourites. We have the quality to beat you, but so do you. It'll either come down to a moment of brilliance from someone or a moment of madness from a player or ref...hopefully not a moment of madness though.

Whoever wins tomorrow will win the title. I think both teams will drop points elsewhere in the run-in, but I can see both teams picking up the same number of points between next week and 11 May, so whoever wins tomorrow will have that slight advantage and the other team won't catch up.

Yeah, I see no point in being a dickhead. I love banter and stuff and I'll take every opportunity I get to wind up a Yernited fan (especially this season :D) but I've nothing against City to be fair and I'm not going to be so arrogant as to start something against fans of a quality side who have the capacity to absolutely embarrass anyone in their path, including us.

Will be absolutely gutted if we don't win tomorrow. The last time we won the title I was 8 months old so I've literally waited my whole life for us to be in a situation in the league like we find ourselves in tomorrow. A draw does us no good whatsoever as it puts it back in your hands.

Anyway, can't wait. I've not thought about anything else all week!

I'm sure you know the basics, but just remember to stretch before and after every run and if it hurts then stop and rest.

Of course he could, if he could if he felt that some of the other views  of those parties were problematic to him. UKIP is the largest group in the EFD

A good rule of thumb for trusting politicians is to examine what they do and who they associate with, not what they say.

If what you claim is true, and the UKIP doesn't care for the policies it actively supports in the EFD then the UKIP manifesto should be a single line 'withdraw from Europe'. When it comes to taxation, or social issues such as gay marriage they should state - ""we do not have a position on that"".

&gt; The EFD is really just a collection of parties that want to withdraw

It really isn't - quite a few of the group were involved in actively promoting the Ukraine membership.

Empty except for all the people who live and work in that town.  People who are more likely to use local shops because they are convenient to them.  

I just find it difficult to believe that £1.20 for parking is going to make much difference at all to most people.  I sympathise with people who have no choice in the matter. But towns are congested enough as it is and it is crazy to encourage more people to use cars.  Shops should focus on people who live locally.

Historically, they're British. 
Socially, they're British. 
Culturally, they're British.

The British Empire was peacefully dismantled over the course of the last 60 years; It doesn't exist any longer. The process was almost entirely by self determination of the people that lived in the various places. (The notable exception being Hong Kong, which didn't want to leave the UK, but China refused to renew the lease and threatened to invade.) If a place away from the mainland UK remains a British Overseas Territory, I assure you it's because the population want it; the places that didn't were freely allowed to leave. 

If South America as a continent is still frustrated by foreign powers and dictators meddling, should they not understand the Falklander's plight entirely? Their peace was shattered by a foreign dictator 30 years ago. Today they're the focus of an entire continent of foreign countries salivating at the thought of annexing them. It's Argentina being the imperialist here, not the UK. 

What do the Argentinian people have to gain from annexing the Falklands? What will seriously change if a flag changes on an island none of them will likely ever see and visit (or would want to if it wasn't so controversial to them). What do the Brazilian people have to gain for that matter?

Leave the islanders in peace, they're not hurting anybody. ",0,1397313966,null,0,1397314206,0,cgql3fa,t3_22u4my,t1_cgql3fa,t1_cgqiz61,null,1433323120,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

&gt; I just find it difficult to believe that £1.20 for parking is going to make much difference at all to most people.

It's another factor in the decision. Do you pay 1.20 or typically more, to park in the town centre, deal with traffic, and pay more for goods, or do you sit at home and do it online at no additional cost, potentially saving money.

It sounds like you're someone who hasn't had to deal with the reality of not living next to or in a city centre.

&gt; But towns are congested enough as it is and it is crazy to encourage more people to use cars. 

They are a necessity. Get people out of cars when they're going to work, sure, but it's not always doable when you are shopping.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt; Huh? But the BTL landlords still have to be able to pay their mortgage meanwhile the poor cannot pay rents they cannot afford.

Being able to afford rent or mortgage repayments is completely different to having the disposable income to save for a deposit. The rental market at the moment is certainly more favourite to landlords due to the increased demand for housing which is keeping rent rates and house prices high. Most people can't afford a deposit though, so they have no choice but to rent (At rates higher than mortgage repayments), which in turn means they can't save enough for a deposit.

The help to buy scheme that the government introduced was aimed to tackle the issue, but it's only tackling a symptom of the problem rather than the root cause. The root problem is a growing population combined with a housing shortage, and inadequate plans to build more housing (Which the government really needs to encourage more - which at the moment only a few local councils are doing to the extent required).

EDIT: You could also say that the 'bedroom tax' was an attempt to reduce the problem too, to optimise bedroom utilisation to ensure more people can be homed in the same number of houses. I don't think I need to go into detail as to why this hasn't worked as intended, but basically moving home is more expensive than the cut in benefits.",0,1397314551,null,0,1397314734,0,cgql9z2,t3_22ui9s,t1_cgql9z2,t1_cgqiw17,null,1433323206,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Whilst I agree that no church should play a part in the legality of marriage, that doesn't mean that it's not wrong that churches refuse to conduct same sex marriage. Even if all legal weight was removed from the CoE, it would still be discrimination for them to refuse to grant religious same sex marriage. 

But the whole problem of whether it's right or not to force the church to grant same sex marriages to one side, UKIP are certainly not a pro-gay party. If they were pro-same sex marriage, they would say so. Most of the country is pro-same sex marriage, which is one of the main reasons it passed in Parliament. There's huge pressure on them to be same sex marriage, but the party itself is so Conservative that Farage can't stand up and say that the party would support same sex marriage after leaving the EU, for the main reason that they wouldn't. 

The EU forcing churches to grant same sex marriage is just not true. We've had this legislation for decades and half the signatories still don't have equal marriage. The ECRH is very ineffective on certain issues, and this is one of them. The ECRH is not going to force churches to do anything, because it would have done it by now. I'm not familiar with all the precedents set by the ECHR since its foundation, but I highly suspect there was a case which rule that inequality was allowed for marriage (probably because it conflicts with freedom of religion). So saying that we shouldn't have same sex marriage whilst under the influence of the EU is just a way of snirkishly avoiding the issue.

There is also not that many of them compared to other major ethnic groups and are almost non-existent in popular culture (I can name only two famous British Chinese from the top of my head).

true,rev9of8,null,null,"I worked for Sky in a dual Customer Service/Technical Support role on both the analogue and digital platforms during the digital transition. We refunded a lot of people for PPV porn - but it wasn't because of incorrect billings. It was because the account holder was female, it was common knowledge that the default PIN for PPV services was the last four digits of the viewing card number and there were males in the house who, when the wife/mother gets the bill, don't want to admit they were watching porn because of fucked up attitudes to porn in this country.

As an example, I once had the fun of dealing with a single mother who told me she had a sixteen year old son but that ""he's not into that kind of thing"". In the end, it was just easier to credit back the cost of the PPVs and get the account holder to change the PIN than it is to have the fucking argument with them.

It wasn't the systems incorrectly billing people (and we even got some boxes back from the worst offenders on occasion, checked the equipment and simply couldn't replicate the supposed fault), it's the result of fucking hypocritical attitudes to sex and sexuality as well as a desire to try getting anything and everything for free due to a seriously fucked up sense of entitlement too many people have.

At the time I was working for Sky, I also used to frequent and post on uk.media.tv.sky as well as various other places. We knew all the tricks and stunts etc that people would pull on us to try and get things for free/not pay for services and it was fucking hilarious seeing how people you'd dealt with would lie through their fucking teeth and make outrageous claims. There were a few of us who'd take the time to explain how things worked or correct misperceptions but it would frequently get drowned out in the noise from hysterical fuck-nuggets (particularly the full-on raving paranoid Jomtien).

I once dealt with a guy who actually started a call with ""I have a PhD in computing..."" who was an obnoxious, condescending cunt to me who couldn't hide his contempt for mere ""phone monkeys"". I dealt with his issue - which turned out to be that he was too fucking stupid to understand how the PPV system worked. When I got home after my shift I grabbed a beer, fired up the PC and logged into usenet. I come across a message which had been x-posted between uk.misc and uk.media.tv.sky which upon reading was clearly from Mr. ""I have a PhD"".

One thing that makes the playing field more level is delivery charges. Scan used to charge a minimum of £7 for delivery. On a £30 hard drive that's an additional 23%. So you could bulk buy hard drives from Scan, sell the drives in your shop for the same price Scan charges including delivery, thus making the cost exactly the same, and make a 20% or more profit which is seen as very good in most retail sectors.

I mean on paper, it looked like we should win obviously, team that has horrible away form, bottom of the league, leaking goals. Always the whole ""fighting against relegation"" thing but still, you'd like a win. 

That's where I can't believe we lost.


Where I'm not surprised is after watching the first half and not scoring I just thought ""This is not going to end well, they'll get some lucky goal and we'll not get anything after."" Our total domination of possession, as happens so often, resulted in so little.

I seriously think we missed Rodriguez and his direct running. Looked a bit lost without him to try and get into the box or cut through the defence. Plenty of passing and possession between the middle players, great, but absolutely nothing came from it, no penetration at all, disappointing prom night for all involved.


Having to bring on an 18 year old and Do Prado as our attacking subs really shows our lack of depth in attack. If we don't improve there this summer I seriously can't see us improving on 8th next season, if not maybe a dip in form to properly mid-table.


Shaw and Chambers' delivery today was also just terrible, nothing in the way of decent crosses that could be attacked, far too many over hit (Chambers) or scuffed along the floor (Shaw). When Clyne came on I think his pace showed a bit, got forward and bombed down the wing quicker which could have made a difference over the whole game.


Obviously Marshall made a couple of decent saves, especially the one against Clyne, thought he'd just been wrong footed and it'd poke into the bottom corner, but no such luck. But even so we should have tested him more and definitely should have got a goal. As soon as their goal went in we just looked tired really, and even as it went in when no-one closed Cala down. Then Zaha came on and just pressured us not stop at the front, suddenly we looked on the back foot when he was near the ball.

All in all extremely unhappy and very disappointed, and suddenly I can't wait for the season to be over, while wishing for new signings and Rodriguez to be fit and back in form by the start of next season.

The only other legitimate negatives I can think of, aside from the three I listed already, is that the EU is pro-business which can lead to very large businesses with too much influence who are capable of influencing government and starting small monopolies. 

And that the high levels of immigration lead to the atomising of local communities, but this is a problem with globalisation generally and would continue whether we were int he EU or not. 

There's a reason that Farage gets branded as a con-man and a lier. A lot of his criticisms of the EU just aren't very legitimate. There's usually a slither of truth in them, but I just don't buy into them at all because they're so plainly misleading and rely on a lack of understanding.

I don't like wasting my time and my memory on remembering, what I consider to be, incorrect POVs.

---

&gt;__Reform of local government in Northern Ireland__ sees the replacement of the [twenty-six districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland) created in 1973 with a smaller number of ""super districts"". The review process began in 2002, with proposals for either seven or eleven districts made before it was suspended in 2010. On 12 March 2012, the [Northern Ireland Executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Executive) published its programme for government, which included a commitment to reduce the number of councils in Northern Ireland to 11.  The first [elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_local_elections,_2014) to these new councils will be on 22 May 2014.

I'd only save Vert from those four however, and Kaboul can be salvaged I guess, but after today(and really the entire season) we've shown that we need an established CB anchor -- someone in the Per Mertesacker/Vincent Kompany mold - doesn't surge forward and doesn't make mistakes. As for LB, I would say do all that we can to get Luke Shaw. If not, then Ben Davies. Rose cannot play another game in a Spurs uniform. He's absolutely horrendous. My hopes for Lloris staying are dwindling by the day and unless we promise a defensive powerhouse in front of him for the next season, I don't think he'll be too keen on continuing to be left out to dry week after week.

Yes, he's played well for us in the second half of the campaign, but that's because its a contract year for him - if Levy decides to extend it, I can only see him returning to his apathetic form. Plus his penalty was fucking abysmal - Foster knew where he was going before he started moving towards the ball, not to mention he didn't even try to change the power or angle of the shot when Foster started moving left it was fucking embarrassing. Lastly, and obviously Good Riddance, Sherwood. FdB or LVG, White Hart Lane awaits your arrival.

true,_someone_somewhere_,flair8,,"This is a comment not written out of anger at today's result, but I believe for us to even think of keeping Sherwood as a manager next season would be a terrible mistake and would cost us dearly.

I believe this because of points that were highlighted in today's match,

* Defence: Shocking display today by players of international quality, one has to question the coaching when Rose and Naughton are coming in from the wings leaving us open to attacks that caused the 2 early goals. It is as if the players are receiving poor instructions or are not getting any at all.

* Attack: We have some very gifted players yet we continuously resort to long ball tactics, the sort that I would expect to see from a League One team. Yes, Ade is tall and strong and can receive these sorts of balls but the rate of success is low and possession was lost repeatedly.  

* Formation: Player placement boggles the mind, having Eriksen, a number 10 player, on the wing, with Chadli, a winger, in the centre. With each moving into each other's position regularly.

* Professionalism: Sherwood's attitude and behaviour is not that of a professional manager, having just seeing his team performing so poorly, he should be fuming after that match, but to see him laugh and joke with West Brom players on the pitch after the match is strange.

The only positive to take from this is that we are blessed with some very skilled and driven players (Eriksen) but I fear that the player's lack of believe in or understanding of Sherwood could linger into next season.",0,1397320518,null,0,false,0,cgqncjs,t3_22uzbm,t1_cgqncjs,t3_22uzbm,null,1433324181,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

That's important, specially to countries that have been colonised - we should be past that by now and more developed countries keeping lands half a world away as a show of power or to maintain strategic points goes against that.

To briefly talk about your second point, it's tricky. South Americans are mostly not descendant from Portuguese/Spanish colonisers directly but are a huge mix of indigenous, colonisers and slaves. I think giving natives complete control is a boat that sailed a long time ago. These are areas of the world that were forced to become a certain way and have finally reached a level of stability with a mixed population of people who follow ancient and modern life-styles. My general feeling is also that there is less of a push in most SA countries to 'be' a certain way, most of them tend to be fairly accepting of native tradition and culture (though Brazil, where I'm from leaves a lot to be desired there). In short I don't think it's possible to simply reset the button and give them the land back, in the same way that you can't just return the land to North American Indians and Eskimos. You can however develop a policy of mutual respect and understanding, of allowing these communities control and peace and protection and aid where they wish and continue the developing of other parts of the country. Is no easy task, indeed I'd say the biggest challenge facing SA, a lot of Africa, Asia and maybe even the Roma/Gypsie community in Europe; but it is a cause we need to get to grips with.

true,bruce_mcmango,null,null,"One of my favourite things is to walk along the Water of Leith starting in the Village of Dean and coming out in Stockbridge (where on a Sunday there is a lovely market). It's so scenic. You pass statues, a mineral water well, the landscaped gardens of the posh New Town buildings as well as going through the Dene Bridge. In Stockbridge, I would recommend the best lattes in Edinburgh at Peters Yard followed by patisserie in Patisserie Madeline. 

Alternatively, try taking a walk along the back of Holyrood Park, making your way towards Duddingston. There you have Duddingston Loch and Bird Sanctuary where you can feed the swans, geese and other birds before heading over to the Sheeps Heid Inn - a 14th century pub with lovely food and complete with a skittles alley. http://www.sheepheid.co.uk/

If the weather is too onerous, try the Dominion Cinema in Morningside - an independent cinema complete with sofas. Morningside and Bruntsfield come complete with lots of nice little shops and cafes. 

If you've got money to spend, there's no better way to sightsee than on a back of a bright yellow motor-tricycle http://www.triketoursscotland.com/tours.html

The Natural History Museum has a wooly mammoth exhibition on which is very good and if you venture over to the National Museum side, they're exhibiting the Wildlife Photographer of the Year photos for free. Just behind the museum on South College Street you have Brew Lab - a cafe that takes its coffee terribly seriously (to good results).

For food, I personally love dim sum at Stack half-way up Leith Walk.

It means there is no continuity when you change manager and you have to start all over again.


Worst home record in 140 years. 7 losses in 10, 13 losses in 20. Worse points record at the same stage as last season and McLeish. We're going backwards and most of our ""young, improving players"" are not actually that young any more and certainly don't show significant signs of improvement.

The tactics are pathetic and completely 1 dimensional. The same mistakes are made every week - no width and if the counter fails we have **nothing**. The quality and style of play is just awful to watch - exactly the opposite to what we thought we were getting after McLeish. He isn't taking any chances on our promising young players from the academy.


I will always support the team, but I think massive changes need to be made at the very top of the club, as well as Lambert not being the right man to rebuild us.

I'm curious to hear how it's more nuanced than i've been describing though, if you don't mind giving me your perspective in a little more detail. 

I know there was a failed British invasion of Argentina in 1845, but that was a colonial war with the Spanish wasn't it? Why is would that be an issue now?

I just really don't see why some Argentinians are so anguished about the islands, it was never Argentinian to begin with, so they can't be arguing for the 'return of rightful territory'. If that was the case as well, why do they want South Georgia too? Argentina have never had a presence in South Georgia. 

Is it because of the resources around the Falklands? Is it because of Antarctica? Is it the idea of having a European power in South America? Why isn't Brazil arguing for the annexation of French Guyana? 

I think it's a massive shame that it's an issue between countries in this day and age, people can mostly come and go freely, to kick up a fuss this big over something that really doesn't affect anyone except the people on the island is tragic in the grand scheme of things.

true,Tabathock,EN,england,"Ok, generalising massively here but on reddit, the only people I have seen saying he should play are all America. I assume that you are too. 

The American fans seem to like the idea of a fair game with two equal sides, and an opportunity for a young player to prove himself on a big stage. It's a really nice narrative that fits in with how they view sport and sportsmanship. 

The British fans see Courtois as a threat to our going through. If we had the opportunity to stop Diego Costa and Tiago playing I'd take it in a heartbeat. This is generalising massively, but another aspect is that Brits might tend to see laws and contracts as pretty sacrosanct, Atletico knew what they were getting into when they signed the contract to loan him and have a duty to honour the spirit in which that contract was intended. Lukaku wouldn't play against us in the premier league - no matter how much Everton would want him to - why should Atletico be allowed to play him in a knock-out competition? 

The coverage in the British press isn't about whether Chelsea can force Atletico not to play him, it's about whether they can legally stop him playing. The assumption obviously being that it would be brainless to let your opponents line up with one of their best players if you could avoid it. Particularly as there is an obvious conflict of interesting in having Courtois play. If he let in a sitter the Madrid press would haul him through the coals, a ghastly prospect for a 21 year old to have to face. 

Furthermore, British Chelsea fans don't seem to care if people like their club - as least not as much as foreign Chelsea fans. English football fans tend not to have much choice as to who they support, it's something that they fall into because of where they live, who their friends support etc. The slagging matches and banter between supporter of various teams are pretty commonplace and it's accepted that no one else but you will support your team (unless it's something like people having a preference for AFC Wimbledon over MK Dons.) American fans probably care more if their team is seen as classy. English fans want a winning side, and openly laugh at people who say their club's ""classier"" or who put an emphasis on their sides style of play over actual results. Just look at the enthusiasm that Crystal Palace fans have for Tony Pullis, Brentford fans have for their new manager and the disdain which spuds fans treat Tim Sherwood. 

TL:DR - The American fans like the narrative and sportsmanship of Courtois playing, the English Chelsea fans just want us to win. ",0,1397326033,null,0,1397326770,0,cgqpeuh,t3_22t96n,t1_cgqpeuh,t1_cgqa30d,null,1433325154,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

Honestly, the only reasonable managers available are Mackay, Zola, Di Matteo and Laudrup. Mackay and Zola really aren't the sort of managers we want if we want to progress. Di Matteo won the CL with a very good Chelsea side, but you only have to look at his time at the baggies to realise he's not all that. Laudrup had a very good first season with Swansea, but his tactics this season before being fired were dreadful. 

Leaves you thinking that we might as well stick with Lambert, for now at least. While his tactics have been questionable at times this year, a lot of the players he's bought that looked promising have been injured for large spells this season (Okore, Kozak, Luna, now Benteke)

That said, there's no way Lerner will sack Lambert. He's saved him way too much money in terms of the wage bill. If he was ever going to sack him, he'd have done it last season after that shambles against Bradford.

Or if you do need to pay there's normally credit to that value on the card. Corner shops usually sell SIM cards for like £1 too. Especially Lebara. Corner shops seem to love Lebara.

Assuming Lampard has a season left in him, Terry two (maybe), Cech two or less depending on the Courtios situation, and Cole one, I'd say David Luiz (assuming he isn't sold) as Captain and Gary Cahill as Vice-Captain, based on our current line-up.

I think Luiz is a big personality and someone who never says die when it comes to big matches. He still has some way to go in being disciplined, but I think as a player who already captains his country it's a no brainier for us.

Gary Cahill suits Vice-Captain well, since he doesn't seem imposing enough to command the team, but is responsible enough to help lead it. I think he'd make a good partner with Luiz.

Ivanovich would be another good shout, as he captain's his country too, but assuming the position wont be open for another two seasons, I imagine he'll likely be in decline since he's 30 now.

The other players in our squad are either too young or wont be here (Torres, Ba, Eto'o) when JT and Lamps leave. I'd like to see what happens to Hazard as I think he might have a captain's quality about him, but I think it all depends on how he develops both as a player and a man.

I don't have the answer, I don't think there is one all I can do is give my perspective and thoughts coming from a background that has been as involved in history and social sciences as I can be for my age.

I think what escapes most Brits talking about the issue is the lack of perspective on what it is like to come from a country that has been colonised and that until very recently or in some cases until up to today had little stability or free democracy. In particular, many SA countries were plunged into a military dictatorship backed by foreign countries, the U.S. in particular - because of the direction their goverments were taking. If you pair this with colonialism, and I mean Brazil got off lightly the Spanish were fucking brutal on their colonies. This is without getting into political agreements, investiments, etc. So when you consider this background, it is a continent that has a persecution mentality (for good or bad) and that feels very strongly about feeling independent from the rest of 'developed countries' so they can become developed in their own right. Land dispute has always been a huge part of this so to have Britain - who at one point had the largest empire in the world - have a set of islands, 400 km form the coast is a slap in the face of all this historical context.

For Argentinians it's a sore topic because they feel the islands legally belong to them under international sea laws and they were given a proper smackdown when they tried to get them back. They're sore and sour to add to what I talked about above :)

I think it has a lot to do with the position of the islands and the European power in South America. As for the French Guyana or Suriname, I don't know. Why isn't every country with a tiny country next to it trying to anexe it. I guess the fact that those tiny countries are well within Brazilian sphere of influence helps a lot. I don't know.

&gt;In part you have to be very lucky with these schemes.

You do. My dad's friend who he worked with for 20 years was offered an investment into a local courier service and he put £10,000 in, effectively his life savings because work was scarce and money was tight at home. He was given a van as part of the deal and it initial all checked out. One night, his van went missing and one of the neighbours said someone walked up to the van, unlocked it with a key and drove off. Then when my dad's friend went to report the stolen van to the company, the phone line was dead.

He found out it was a scam and the company took the van with keys and disappeared off the face of the earth. My dad's friend killed himself a few weeks later in his garage by asphyxiation with a pipe into the car. My dad only found out after going to a trade place to pick up some supplies and the guy who owns the shop told him. It was incredibly sad because my dad's friend was always responsible with money but fell for a scam out of desperation. The police haven't found the people who scammed him yet and his family aren't doing well.
