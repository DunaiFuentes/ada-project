So you're not sure being accurate about what's happening to 42% of the monthly repayment is ""important"" to the OP? That's er, interesting. 

&gt; You are making the case...


I wasnt making any case at all. I was merely pointing out your statement about ""paying yourself"" the full sum of the monthly mortgage payment was false. You are massively projecting your own decisions/ prejudices on my statement.


And your subsequent statements fo nothing to correct this. Sure you may ""make money"" over the repayment term, but you are effectively taking out a huge leveraged bet on future property price rises, which at this point in time, with interest rates at 300 year lows, may be very risky to assume.

&gt;Explain to me how an influx of black faces on TV/film simply getting there by virtue of skin colour is a good thing.

Ah, that one. So in the case of our friend Idris who ""made it"" he, a British actor, had only 53 TV appearances on British television in his entire career, for a near decade. Small parts, one or two episodes here or there. Nothing big, nothing important, nothing stable.

You may think over a decade thats actually quite a lot, but to put it in perspective in years like 1995 he had a single acting gig. The same in 2000. He had years where he'd have to stretch a single role on a single TV show for his whole year. I'm not sure what you think TV actors get paid for small non-recurring roles on shows like The Bill or Londons Burning but I doubt he was living the life of a hollywood superstar.

So he gave up. He moved to the US. Within the same year he was on 4 US hit TV shows.  I'm sure you've heard of Law and Order and CSI. Within another year he was a *star* on the hit US TV show The Wire. That *one* show he was on 37 episodes. That's 70% of his previous decades work in one show! Now he's a household name and movie star.

You see, his ""screen presence, and decent chops as an actor"" didn't count for shit here in the country where he was born. Yet guys like you continually espouse the nonsensical notion you'll ""make it"" if you're good enough.

If he was the only example it would be one thing. Yet the same story repeats itself. Chiwetel Ejoifor, David Harewood, David Oyelowo, Lennie James, Sophie Okonedo, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Thandie Newton as well as the two you mention.

All award winning actors who have started in award winning movies and TV shows who couldn't get work here in their *own* country until they proved their chops in the more competitive US market. Imagine that.

No one questions why the likes of the laughable and one dimensional Danny Dyer are a mainstay of British television, but woe betide a man who suggests Oscar winning actors from *these* shores get a TV gig! Lets look;

Oscar nominated films featuring Chiwetel Ejiofor - 3. Oscar nominated films featuring Danny Dyer - 0. But if Ejiofor got on your telly it would be tokenism, right?

So what next? What about the *next* generation of young black actors? Well again we have the young Aml Ameen. Well would you look at that?! Within 2 years of giving up trying to scratch a living here in the UK he's in an Oscar nominated film in the US with Oscar winners Forest Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey, Vanessa Redgrave, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Robin Williams.

Ok, firstly, City do not have a better goal per game ratio. Its close, but Liverpool have a better ratio. Secondly, when teams haven't played the same amount of games you cannot compare their goals per game ratio, simply because they are yet to play vs the same teams. For instance, Liverpool have 96 goals in 36 games and City have 93 goals in 35 games. If City lose their next game vs Everton - a team Liverpool have already faced - they will have a much worse goal to game ratio.

I'm simply going to copy and paste a comment I made [here in this discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/242liy/ukip_candidate_william_henwood_defends_lenny/ch3z7x9?context=3) as to how I feel about the situation.

&gt;LMAO, right lets start with Idris Elba...So in the case of our friend Idris who ""made it"", he, a British actor, had only 53 TV appearances on British television in his entire career, for a near decade. Small parts, one or two episodes here or there. Nothing big, nothing important, nothing stable.

&gt;You may think over a decade thats actually quite a lot, but to put it in perspective in years like 1995 he had a single acting gig. The same in 2000. He had years where he'd have to stretch a single role on a single TV show for his whole year. I'm not sure what you think TV actors get paid for small non-recurring roles on shows like The Bill or Londons Burning but I doubt he was living the life of a hollywood superstar.
So he gave up. He moved to the US. Within the same year he was on 4 US hit TV shows. I'm sure you've heard of Law and Order and CSI. Within another year he was a star on the hit US TV show The Wire. That one show he was on 37 episodes. That's 70% of his previous decades work in one show! Now he's a household name and movie star.

&gt;You see, his ""screen presence, and decent chops as an actor"" didn't count for shit here in the country where he was born. Yet guys like you continually espouse the nonsensical notion you'll ""make it"" if you're good enough.
If he was the only example it would be one thing. Yet the same story repeats itself. Chiwetel Ejiofor, David Harewood, David Oyelowo, Lennie James, Sophie Okonedo, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Thandie Newton as well as the two you mention.

&gt;All award winning actors who have starred in award winning movies and TV shows who couldn't get work here in their own country until they proved their chops in the more competitive US market. Imagine that.
No one questions why the likes of the laughable and one dimensional Danny Dyer are a mainstay of British television, but woe betide a man who suggests Oscar winning actors from these shores get a TV gig! Lets look;

&gt;Oscar nominated films featuring Chiwetel Ejiofor - 3. Oscar nominated films featuring Danny Dyer - 0. But if Ejiofor got on your telly it would be tokenism, right?

&gt;So what next? What about the next generation of young black actors? Well again we have the young Aml Ameen. Well would you look at that?! Within 2 years of giving up trying to scratch a living here in the UK he's in an Oscar nominated film in the US with Oscar winners Forest Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey, Vanessa Redgrave, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Robin Williams.

Not really. The CoE has become increasingly evangelical at its heart. There have been statements from people like Archbishop Sentamu decrying secularism and stating they'd prefer a shared set of privileges with all faiths rather than a secular nation of all faiths being equal private operations.

Essentially the long term plan of many in CoE is to extend the current system to cover Catholics, Jews and Muslims to keep their own set of privileges in place. Everyone wins apart from the growing non-religious faction this will screw over.

So they were struggling because of the colour of their skin? How many white actors hardly worked in the UK or Ireland and only made it because they managed to get a role in an American film or TV show? 
Britain's main problem isn't the lack of diversity in its media, but the fact that we have shit TV shows and films. Any actor worth their salt will choose the states over the UK and that's what these actors did, the industry here isn't up to it. 

Look at your man Aml Ameen. wasn't he in Kidulthood and a regular on The Bill at the age of 19 or something? As far as British flicks and shows  go that's pretty good, pretty well known. That he wasn't scratching a living from  the money he was making may be because the UK pays shit, so he left, and good for him.
 
Also Ejoifor - wasn't one of his first movie roles in a bloody Spielberg pic? Like right off the bat? Unfair to say that the UK turned its back on him if that's the first role he got, and theres no reason for him to return. That's like saying Christian Bale should come back and do Spooks even though his first movie role was in Empire of the Sun. 

Steve McQueen is another. Its easy to say that its only the US that gave this talented black guy a break by funding his movies but lets not forget he won the fucking Turner prize in the 90s. Its not like he was ignored here, he just did what anyone would do and went where the money is.  He made *Shame* with Fassbender - an Irish guy who couldn't get arrested in his own country but got in Band of Brothers and never looked back.
 

I would never defend Danny Dyer - I hate the prick and all of his ilk, but his constant working is just part of the same machine that kept useless performers like Gina Yashere and Felix Dexter on the TV for 2 decades. Its not like talentless people are thin on the ground on our screens, and its obvious that colour isn't a boundary when appearing on soaps and poor TV shows simply from the number of different  colours we see on these popular but lame productions. 

There are black performers on every soap, presenting on every news show, and on every radio station .The fact that most appear on shit programming (just like their white counterparts) speaks volumes about the British public's bad taste rather than their racism.   

My problem is that forcing the hand of the decision makers based solely on ""there aren't enough black faces"" will only serve to strengthen this bullshit diversity, which isn't heartfelt or sincere at all. More talentless folk on screen, less quality on British TV and in British Film Schools and studios.

true,jjones217,num23,,"This is true, but there are some considerations and caveats that should be addressed when using such a transitive idea/statement:

1. Moyes did well with Everton and took them as high as he was every going to take them.

2. Moyes played a very conservative (defensive, almost) style of football in doing so.

3. Everton are a ""smaller"" club at the moment, at least financially, than are Spurs, even though they're going to finish higher than us this year.

Conversely

1. Spurs need a manager that can handle a highly paid squad, can be a man- and tactical manager, and can push Spurs higher than their current 72 point glass ceiling. Moyes couldn't even do that with the likes of United, a richer, ""more talented"" squad - how could he do it with Spurs?

2. Spurs, and their supporters as well, expect the club to play a very fluid, up-tempo, attacking style of football. Moyes didn't bring that to Everton or United. He certainly wouldn't at Spurs.

3. Spurs are a bigger club. Even though they aren't making Europe this year, they need a manager that has experience in winning championships and playing in the Champions league. Moyes doesn't offer that. AVB did offer that, but he was a failed experiment (though some would argue he deserved more time).

Spurs have two options when deciding their next manager and, thus, their future:

1. A manager that has won championships (or close, such an an annual top 3/4) and can manage a football team whose schedule involved the league season, domestic cups, *and* European competition

2. A manager that, though young and not exactly at the same level as the manager above, can bring the qualities of Spurs football as manager and, most importantly *will be given time to implement his system, develop players, and build to success,* even if that means missing European football for a year or two.

With Moyes, we don't get either of those. With Pochettino or someone like Roberto Martinez, we get the 2nd. With someone like van Gaal or de Boer, neither of whom I think we'll get, we'd get the first.

Here are a list of managers that meet the above criteria. They are in no particular order. Also note: I'm not saying that I want them to manage Spurs or that they'd be a good fit, per se, I'm just saying that  they meet the above criteria:

* Mauricio Pochettino
* Roberto Martinez
* Louis van Gaal
* Frank DeBoer
* Rafael Benitez
* Diego Simeone
* Roberto di Matteo
* Jurgen Klinsmann
* Michael Laudrup (not quite young, buter young*ish*
* Jurgen Klopp
* Massimiliano Allegri
* Sean Dyche


Of the above managers, I think only Laudrup, Pochettino, Dyche, and Allegri would be available.

Now of course, Levy knows what he's doing and has probably already lined up a few candidates on his shortlist and some will likely surprise us. Anyway, this turned in to a rant, but the long story short is: Moyes isn't fit for Spurs. He'll do no better for us than he did at Everton or United, which was to make a couple of top four finishes, but never challenge for anything more.",0,1398675421,null,0,false,0,ch405jm,t3_2452le,t1_ch405jm,t1_ch3zdo3,null,1433554923,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Revlon Colorstay in Ivory might be a viable option but I'd try it first.

If you like mineral makeup there's a few from America that actually are quite cheap from indie brands - Meow Cosmetics make like a bazillion shades including very pale ones and you can match to undertone, you'll probably have to order a few samples first though.

&gt;__Caerphilly Castle__ ([Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): *Castell Caerffili*) is a [medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval) [fortification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle) in [Caerphilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerphilly) in [South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales). The castle was constructed by [Gilbert de Clare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_de_Clare,_7th_Earl_of_Gloucester) in the 13th century as part of his campaign to conquer [Glamorgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamorgan), and saw extensive fighting between Gilbert and his descendants and the native Welsh rulers. Surrounded by extensive artificial lakes – considered by historian Allen Brown to be ""the most elaborate water defences in all Britain"" – it occupies around 30 acres (120,000 m^2) and is the second largest castle in Britain.  It is famous for having introduced [concentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric_castle) castle defences to Britain and for its large [gatehouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatehouse).

&gt;Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was opposed by Gilbert's Welsh rival [Llywelyn ap Gruffudd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_ap_Gruffudd), leading to the site being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271. Despite these interruptions, Gilbert successfully completed the castle and took control of the region. The core of Caerphilly Castle, including the castle's luxurious accommodation, was built on what became a central island, surrounding by several artificial lakes, a design Gilbert probably derived from that at [Kenilworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenilworth_Castle). The dams for these lakes were further fortified, and an island to the west provided additional protection. The concentric rings of walls inspired [Edward I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England)'s [castles in North Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castles_and_Town_Walls_of_King_Edward_in_Gwynedd), and proved what historian Norman Pounds has termed ""a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain"".

I'll quote my reply to another post from further up:

""My step-son has been out of work for just over three years. He's 29 so too old for apprenticeships. He also fucked around at school* and left with hardly any qualifications - which he regrets hugely now. His only jobs have been low-level admin and customer care.

He's now in a huge pool of people who have little to no skills, and very little experience. Every job he applies for he's up against school-leavers who are cheaper to employ and people with a better skill-set. Even for jobs like staking shelves. He is literally the last person someone is going to hire. 

\* Before I met his mum so, no I couldn't have done anything about it, and it's something I have zero sympathy for.""

&gt;Second they are also being offered a chance to train or do voluntary work for 6 months. I've done both of the last two things to find work in my time and they both paid off.

I'm sort of on the fence about this:  The son mentioned above got his last job indirectly through volunteering, and there's nothing wrong with more training education for anyone.  However, if those voluntary positions are taking away real jobs then it's just making the situation worse.

&gt;And to the points about it being disgraceful to be expected to attend the Jobcentre everyday and people losing 3 hours of their day. Boo Fucking Hoo anybody working has to attend work every day for 8 or so hours.

Not a good comparison, it'd be more like being told by your employer that instead of working 8 hours a day and being paid for it you'll be working 12 but still only getting paid for 8.  Losing three hours of job seeking time to attend a ten minute appointment is daft and unhelpful.

Generally local communities only really notice Roma or gypsies when there's conflict of some kind.  We've got some travellers on some green belt near us; and it it honestly took community meetings and uproar about the travellers trying to buy the land before I'd even noticed they were there.

If you walked past ""good"" Roma or gypsy people in the street, you probably wouldn't know them.  It's the bad ones we notice, and that colours our perception of them as a people. 

I have more of a problem with travelling people in general living on public land, using local services without paying council tax and earning without paying income tax, than I do with their individual behaviour.  

&gt;stole my back, abused me every time I went past, and trashed the place, poisoning and polluting the wildlife.

Is this any different to what non-gypsy pissed-up chav kids do when they're bored?  That's not really Roma / gypsy specific behaviour.

This week, I'm signing off because not only am I fed up of being treated like an idiot by them, potential employers and taken for granted by recruitment agencies. They will not be getting their free IT support for a week...  
I live in a small simple area near Cambridge, All we have is farms, equipment repairers and offshoot offices for the tech industry. 1 Industry doesn't advertise at all because they reckon British works will not work for 50 hours a week with low pay.. 1 farmer even said no one applies to his adverts (which, to be honest have never seen any advertised at all.. Must be advertising in the Times or something..), Equipment repairs want experienced mechanics for farm machinery with at least 5 years and degree's. Tech offices want degrees or outsource everything to even pickier companies.  I spot like 30 adverts a week, runnign a basic filter through them and 5 appear to be legit/non clones of each other. Rest are clones, fakes/scams, tagged as expired.. Majority of these are from JCP's own site.
For the past 2 and a half years I've asked 'Can I start my own business?', they explained the options.. Went with what they suggested and also took on my own advice seeking mission from friends and networking groups.  Also started my own thing, learnt web design and started building up my own reputation and earning around 30 a week, declared as its within the limit.
5 months later the 1st referral company got back to me (alarm bell 1?) and we set up meetings and general paperwork.. Following week JCP decides to put me on Work Program and cancels everything with referral, Claims WP will help. WP constantly said JCP is responsible. JCP says WP is responsible and if they won't do anything, I'd have to wait until that finishes.  
A few useless CLAIT courses, business admin what never completed (cheap training companies FTW) interviews I wanted, travelling 200 miles to an interview I didn't want and refusal to pay my travel allowance for it (finished by reading part of their contract down the phone to them) Losing my home due to climbing costs and rent and depression setting in making me sick.. (brings us to around this xmas.. Almost finished) We are back to 'Can I have help setting up my own business?', Sure.. Another referral.. April ""Oh You're already doing this sort of thing as declared income.. can't help you"". Back to JCP 'This is what they said, any ideas? any local mentor programs?', ""no one we have contracts with"" Helpful..  Add in that they are overwhelmed and won't locally recruit.. I can't see this working either.

I see this as another mess around and interference to searches, especially when there isn't anything what will cover travel costs in the area. With my deteriorating health and mental well being, I can't deal with this crap.. Hence why I wanted to start my own and if successful, give people a chance too.

I thought he was doing that in terms of 'these people weren't picked for reason X'. I can't think of the last show I watched which didn't have anyone black in - but then I don't watch a big enough range of shows to know if that's the case across the board. Hence I'd want to know that X black people had been turned down for a role compared to X white (or any) people - otherwise this sort of thing is reduced to anecdotal smoking grandfathers that lived to 90.

&gt;Elba was playing a guy from Baltimore. Not something that I assume the casting director called for a North London boy to represent.

You did see the 'for example' part of my statement, right? The point is that someone (including Elba) could be picked for any number of reasons other than 'wow, he's a fantastic actor but we must pick him before all others because he is black'. The Wire is actually a great example - do we have anything like that in the UK at all in the first place? It's not as if there aren't hundreds, if not tens of thousands of actors who didn't get discovered at 15 - and even with those that are known, it doesn't signify some kind of security; Ian McKellen was starring in movies like The Keep for years before being given real attention - hence I'm not inclined to assume this problem doesn't exist, but to complain at this level as if it's all-encompassing needs more info to be legitimate.

&gt;I can't think of the last show I watched which didn't have anyone black in

Lets do a completely unscientific experiment. We'll take last nights prime time TV.

**8pm:**

* BBC1  - Antiques Roadshow, presented by Fiona Bruce. Hardly a bastion of multicultural Britain the Roadshow is about as old and white as TV gets.
* BBC2 - Natural World, presented by Paul McGann...it's got bears
* ITV  - Vera, played by Brenda Blethyn, with her assistant played by David Leon. Last black main character left the show 2 years ago.
* C4 - For the Love of Cars, presented by Philip Glenister and Ant Anstead.
* C5 - Rush Hour, American comedy starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. Very popular movie that grossed nearly $250m worldwide and spawned several sequels. The Americans seem to have figured out ethnic minority leads can sell, but we haven't.
* BBC3 - Great Movie Mistakes, presented by Robert Webb. Just him and some clips.
* BBC4 - Don Giovanni from the Royal Opera House. It's Opera, do I even have to describe it?

This continues pretty much all night on all channels with various documentary programmes and all white panel shows, with the only ethnic minorities appearing in American films and TV shows.

The only black British people on TV at that time last night were on Film4 in the movie Fast Girls, which coincidentally starred one of my exes, but I digress.

&gt;__Castell Coch__ (English: Red Castle) is a 19th-century [Gothic Revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_Revival) [castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle) built on the remains of a genuine 13th-century fortification. It is situated on a steep hillside high above the village of [Tongwynlais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongwynlais), to the north of [Cardiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff) in [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales), and is a [Grade I listed building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_I_listed_building) as from 28 January 1963. 

&gt;Designed by [William Burges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Burges), with an impressively medieval appearance, working portcullis and drawbridge, and sumptuous interiors which rival those of [Cardiff Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Castle), it has been described as ""the most spectacular example of [that architect's] translation from High Gothic into High Victorian.""

&gt; So, last night I ventured down to my local for the first time since it changed hands a month or so ago. I'm by no means a regular, I go perhaps 2 or 3 times a month. It's very small, very basic, and probably not particularly welcoming if you're unfamiliar with it. It used to be owned by a whiskey swilling, chain smoking, cockney exile called Les AKA Eddie, but his ill health meant he had to hand over duties to his sister in law, who kept things running just fine.

&gt; Now a new couple have taken over and they're fucking ruining the decor. They've taken town the photos of Eddie's spaniels working shoots, the various faded old landscapes and amusing framed cartoons, and replaced them with generic Homebase shit, like small prints of pink flowers in gold and silver frames. They've hung a big fucking mirror over the log burner with a gold frame too. They've even added flowers in vases. Everything looks utterly out of place for a small dingy country boozing hole.

&gt; The carpet by the bar has been replaced with grey lino, and there was talk of them re-upholstering the seats.
This is how it used to look, there's another area but I cant find any photos:

&gt; Those old leather bar stools are also gone.
&gt; So yeah, not happy. It's starting to look like a bloody living room. Rant over :)

I live in rural Shropshire, so my local is the closest, but not the best pub in the area. A small town about 7 miles away (population approx 1700) has 6 pubs, all of which have kept going under various ownership for decades, so it's probably safe to say the pup-going habits of my local area are pretty strong. 

This town has a few annual events - beer festival, a couple of fairs, live music events, etc. which draw in large amounts of tourists and locals alike so I guess that contributes a lot to them staying afloat.

Choice of beers is also good. 2 of the pubs have their own breweries, one of which is one of the oldest in the country, dating from 1642. It largely seems to be the older generations that drink these though. No idea why, they're cheaper, some are pretty strong, and they're delicious!

Around here, pubs seem to change ownership more than they actually close down. Due to the scattered populations small town and village pubs often serve people regularly from outside the village.

I visit my local 3-4 times a month, max. This is mainly because I'm quite isolated, and I only have one good mate living close by whith whom I can go to the pub. It's easier if we go a little further afield, somewhere more central where more of s can get to, and where there's better choice and more of an atmosphere. Having said that, the local can get pretty busy on weekends, and even during the week theres a few propping up the bar.",0,1398679104,null,0,1398679409,0,ch40p0g,t3_244t9b,t1_ch40p0g,t3_244t9b,null,1433555178,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

true,Andures,null,null,"Hopefully Rodgers would have picked up the major learning point from the Chelsea match. It takes a very good manager to be philosophical and stubborn about his principles, it takes a great manager to break everything down and change it when the situation requires him to. 

The concept was simple. He was confident in his attack and wanted to get an early breakthrough and mess up Chelsea's positioning. His tactic was like running two cars headfirst into each other to see which one breaks. If Liverpool did succeed in scoring an early goal, Chelsea would possibly be conflicted between continuing their defending or trying to attack more, which would likely mess up their plan. On the other hand, if Liverpool failed to break down the Blue wall and Chelsea managed a goal on the break, then they could happily sit back and kill the game. As it went, the second scenario went through. 

It's great that Liverpool has a manager who sticks to his principles, but one wonders if he could have made a slight bend in order to have better chances at the match. Playing a sort-of 4-4-1-1, with Sterling behind Suarez, Allen and Coutinho in more reserved positions and both Gerrard and Lucas as holding midfielders would have allowed Liverpool to recycle the ball across the 4 defenders and 4 midfielders, effectively have 8 people play keep ball. Chelsea would have had to commit up to 4 players to try and get the ball, which would have created space for Suarez and Sterling. Or, they would have sat back and it would have been a boring match where Liverpool gets close to 100% possession. Either way, the game would have been safer for Liverpool as they would not have had to dedicate more and more bodies forward for the attack. 

It is nice and all to say that you have a philosophy of attacking, but tactics are not really a game of rock-paper-scissors. Chelsea's squad was much better at the 'park the bus"" strategy that lower-table teams employ, simply because their players are better. For an offensive strategy to succeed, it would require Liverpool players to be much better than their Chelsea counterparts, simply because Chelsea has strength in numbers. A strategy of keeping possession would not be too far-fetched from the abilities of the Liverpool players, and that whole ""tiki-taka"" approach would not be too out of place in a team that is used to playing with the ball. 

The greatest managers in history all have their own philosophies, but are able to chop and change their playing style as time goes by while staying true to that philosophy. Being involved in Europe will do a world of good to Brendan Rodgers, because it is in Europe where your tactics and formations can get tested to destruction. Rafa and Mourinho, two of the more successful managers in Europe in recent years, are both famed for being able to adapt to their opponents, and it stands to reason that Rodgers needs to learn this aspect of managing in order to become a great manager.",0,1398679272,null,0,false,0,ch40px5,t3_24659p,t1_ch40px5,t3_24659p,null,1433555190,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;So what is UKIPs actual policy?

The basic idea is to limit mass immigration with a points based system similar to Canada &amp; Austrailia where people come in based on requirement &amp; ability.

&gt;To me it just seems like a typical tactic; blame all our problems on some easy target (the EU, immigrants, people with a different skin tone, the unemployed, the young, the poor, the feckless)

UKIP are suggesting that unrestricted immigration is one of the issues causing those problems, causing unemployment and poverty for people who can't compete with low wage immigrants who can afford to work at or below the minimum wage. 

The issue isn't about skin tone it's about the numbers of people wherever they are from, currently they're mostly white Europeans which makes the constant accusations that UKIP's policy is racist so ludicrous.

true,DrHydeous,null,null,"My local isn't the nearest pub to home - it's a bus ride away, and there are dozens closer - but it's more convenient for most of the people I spend time with. I'm normally there on Mondays. Monday and Tuesday are the quietest nights for pubs, but it does a good trade in booze then anyway. On Thursday/Friday/Saturday it's rammed, and does pretty well on Sunday too, especially with food.

Pubs in general seem to be doing very well in my area. There have been lots of closures, of course, but many of those re-opened after a re-fit. Of the permanent closures, most are of pubs that just plain weren't very good. The three nearest to me that closed were, respectively, the one that the local BNP hung out at, the one that the local pikies and Irish monopolised, and a ""boxing theme pub"". The first two demonstrate what happens when your pub doesn't have a welcoming atmosphere: it goes out of business. The last used to be a great pub, with a boxing gym above it. I'd go to the gym, and then downstairs for a pie and a pint. But then the guvnor thought he could make more money by closing the gym and expanding the pub, while still trading on its association with boxing. Six months later it was closed down by the police because without having actual boxers there to keep order there were too many stabbings, and has been replaced with a block of flats and a police station.

We've also had a brand new pub open nearby in what used to be a mobile phone shop. It's aiming at the very large west African and Caribbean communities in the area - but unlike the two nationally oriented pubs I mention above, people of other nationalities are welcome.

tl;dr summary: pubs are doing well, those that close permanently generally deserve to because they're crap, and are usually replaced with better pubs. And no, the local community isn't particularly affected by pub closures around here - unless you care about the racist/criminal/lets-have-a-fight ""communities"", and IMO they, sadly, aren't affected enough, because they still exist.",0,1398680550,null,0,false,0,ch40wun,t3_244t9b,t1_ch40wun,t3_244t9b,null,1433555280,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Crikey, this has to be understatement of the year on /r/unitedkingdom

Perhaps. But this is exactly what these bastards are doing. Weakening internet/cryptographic security, and violating our privacy rights on an industrial scale. 

&gt; Somebody working there would get a better picture than we get by reading outraged news articles in the Guardian.

Absolutely not. People can be coerced to do all manner of morally repugnant things in a controlled environment and they quickly become the norm. The Stanford Prison Experiment is a good example of this. It's why checks and balances to systems are fundamental to western political philosophy and jurisprudence. The daily mass wiretapping of the population of the United Kingdom is testament to how the lack of proper checks and balances have failed us.

&gt; It's really hard to tell whether they're doing a good job or not, whether they are keeping us safe, or what would happen if they stopped doing what they do.

As the article suggests from terrorism, it has been admitted by the NSA to be very little. In terms of our personal security things are much worse. Nearly a million NSA contractors have access to our bank and credit card details, and to ape your understatements, I'm not very happy about this. They have weakened cryptographic systems, so if I were a lawyer my thoughts would naturally be concerned about lawyer-client privilege, and I wouldn't be too happy about having to use a government controlled cryptographic service. If I were a journalist I would not feel safe doing my job. If I were running an industrial or technology company, I would be very concerned about industrial espionage and the theft of the intellectual property and patents, vis-a-vis EU report into Echelon.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; The basic idea is to limit mass immigration with a points based system similar to Canada &amp; Austrailia where people come in based on requirement &amp; ability.

This was a Tory policy as well, difficult to implement. This is also a bureaucratic nightmare.

&gt; UKIP are suggesting that unrestricted immigration is one of the issues causing those problems, causing unemployment and poverty for people who can't compete with low wage immigrants who can afford to work at or below the minimum wage.

Yeah, but even the tightest controlled borders in the world still have massive problems regarding inequality and a lack of support for citizens. Cutting down immigration won't help, there is very little we can do about illegal immigrants - spending money on policing this kind of activity will hurt our GDP massively, we can't realistically spend much more money on it.

I'm not going to say that immigration causes no issues, but the immigrants aren't to be blamed and with our ageing population we simply need immigrant labour to pay for our pensions.
The issues that it creates though; they should be paid for by those that benefit the most from this state of affairs.
The very sort of people that fund UKIP.
The people that profit, massively and unfairly from ordinary labour.

We see corporate profits rise year on year and none of it goes to the people; yet when the companies fail, guess who bares the brunt of the cost?
UKIP have a scapegoat to distract us, to stop us from acknowledging that the biggest hit to living standards in the UK is the result of the near complete destruction of Unionised labour.
Not the EU, and certainly not immigrants who would find huge issues undercutting union shops.

&gt; The issue isn't about skin tone it's about the numbers of people wherever they are from, currently they're mostly white Europeans which makes the constant accusations that UKIP's policy is racist so ludicrous. UKIP aren't even against immigration they just want it controlled to an extent.

How do the other countries manage it? Of course it will be more bureaucratic than an open door system but how would it be a ""nightmare""?

&gt;but the immigrants aren't to be blamed and with our ageing population we simply need immigrant labour to pay for our pensions

Immigrants aren't to blame, they're here in such numbers because of a political agenda. The politicians are to blame and again immigrants could still come to support the aging population but when required/on work permits. 

&gt;You miss the point, Immigrants are just the social group being blamed for problems. There is no workable solution because they are simply a symptom, not the cause.

Unrestricted immigration is both the cause and symptom of issues in this country and the EU as a whole. Mass immigration to this country is in part a symptom of EU austerity measures driving countries like Greece etc. into the ground so young people are forced to move to find work which ends up undercutting the low wage working classes here.  

UKIP don't portray immigrants as the cause of all the UK's issues but that unrestricted immigration is one aspect of whole load of problems foisted on us by a political elite class.

Alex Salmond: I admire 'certain aspects' of Vladimir Putin's leadership
First Minister said it was a 'good thing' the Russian president had restored national pride in interview at height of Crimea standoff 

 Alex Salmond has revealed his admiration for ""certain aspects"" of Vladimir Putin's leadership and praised the way Russia's national pride has been restored.

The First Minister said it was a ""good thing"" confidence had returned to the country and called the Russian president ""more effective"" than his portrayal by the press suggests.

The remarks were made on March 14 as Mr Putin faced widespread condemnation from the international community with Russian and Ukranian troops squaring off in Crimea.

Critics labelled the remarks ""insensitive and ill-judged"" and said the First Minister's admiration for a man with such a ""controversial"" record on human rights did not reflect well on Scotland.

Jackson Carlaw, Scottish Conservative deputy leader, said Mr Salmond's view ""makes a mockery of the Scottish Government’s faux outrage over the Crimea situation"". 



The controversial comments came during an interview with Alastair Campbell, the former Labour strategy director, due to be published this week in GQ magazine.

Asked about Mr Putin, the First Minister said: ""Well, obviously, I don't approve of a range of Russian actions, but I think Putin's more effective than the press he gets I would have thought, and you can see why he carries support in Russia.""

Pressed on whether he admires the Russian leader, Mr Salmond said: ""Certain aspects. He's restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing. There are aspects of Russian constitutionality and the inter-mesh with business and politics that are obviously difficult to admire. Russians are fantastic people, incidentally, they are lovely people.""

On Sunday Mr Salmond's office attempted to distance itself from the remarks, pointing out they were made before the annexation of Crimea.

Yet while the referendum which saw Crimea vote to join Russia was held on March 16 – two days after the interview – there was already widespread condemnation of Mr Putin's actions when Mr Salmond expressed his admiration.

Almost two weeks earlier Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Nato Secretary General, had publicly warned that Russia's action in Ukraine ""threatens peace and security in Europe"" and criticised ""President Putin’s threats against this sovereign nation"".

Patricia Ferguson, Scottish Labour's external affairs spokesperson, said Mr Salmond's comments were ""insensitive and ill-judged"" given the precarious situation in Ukraine at the time.

""For Scotland's First Minister to admit his admiration for someone with such a controversial record on human rights and democracy does not reflect well on our country,"" she said.

""From his 'unpardonable folly' remarks to his refusal to meet the Dalai Lama, Alex Salmond clearly has a poor record on foreign affairs and it will make Scots wonder what our international relations would be like in an independent Scotland with him at the helm.""

Last month Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, was criticised after naming Mr Putin as the statesman he most admires during a similar interview with Mr Campbell in GQ.

Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, branded Mr Farage's admiration for the Russian president ""extraordinary"" and ""absolutely indefensible"" during a subsequent televised debate.

Mr Salmond also revealed his thoughts on other political leaders during the interview, saying Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was ""pretty effective"" and wondering whether Barack Obama's could have ""done more"" as American president.

Discussing Mr Farage, the First Minister said: ""He is having influence beyond his significance so you have to admire that. There is a constituency for saloon-bar politics and he has played it out. I have a sneaking regard for anyone who takes on powerful establishments.""

A spokesman for the First Minster said the interview was conducted before the annexation of the Crimea, adding: ""Since then, the Scottish Government has made our position abundantly clear on the illegal annexation, including the decision to withdraw the invitation to the Russian Consul General to the annual Scottish Consular Corps dinner.""",0,1398683560,null,0,false,0,ch41eky,t3_245z3c,t1_ch41eky,t1_ch41aad,null,1433555579,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

As soon as one starts to believe we can actually do it, anything less becomes a massive disappointment. Yesterday's game was probably the worst way to lose a football match, with Stevie's mistake and the impotence of our attack compared to Chelsea's very occasional counters. Although we haven't lost the title by any means, I think the horrible feeling we all felt after yesterday's game was the feeling that what we've wanted for the last few months is slipping away (with Mourinho's cunty smug face etched under our eyelids).

My other concern is that, while the mega-bucks of City, Arsenal, United and Chelsea confirm their position at the top of the PL for the foreseeable future, that isn't really case with Liverpool. I really do fear (and have done for the last few weeks) that if we don't win the title this season, we likely won't have as good a chance for many years to come, however well Brendan manages our players.

There is a citizenship test that asks stupid questions and it costs thousands of pounds to go through the process.
More strict policies won't do a damn thing to deter people, they'll just make the process more of a headache.

&gt; Unrestricted immigration is both the cause and symptom of issues in this country and the EU as a whole.

Yeah, but if there was a strong, unionised social movement within the working classes would have a defence.
An anti-migration policy does nothing for working class people, and the other UKIP policies that include removing working time directives and other employment laws are even worse.

Its not just that it won't help working class people like my family, its that it actively distracts from the fact that representative democracy *in the UK* is completely failing the working class and that a movement is desperately needed (like in the 1900s, the 1930s and post world war 2).

I like Birmingham as a city, it is very green, there are a lot of parks to hang out in when it's nice weather. The city centre isn't huge but has everything you need, there is quite a good night life, but more for electronic music, the live music scene isn't very good, not much local rock music or anything but there are some good funk bands around so depends what you're in to.

The university has a very nice campus and the student area next to it (Selly Oak) is ok, got some fairly cheap bars that are always full of students. There's an Aldi in Selly Oak which is pretty cheap but generally supermarkets are the same anywhere you go in the UK.

The university is well respected and usually scores high for grades/reputation/student satisfaction although I was somewhat disenfranchised by the end of my time there but I think that was more to do with the university system in general, not just Birmingham. The union bar is pretty fucking terrible though, no decent events on and it's more expensive than most of the local bars in the area, also all of the shops in the union are overpriced so shop elsewhere.

The economy in the area is pretty bad so you could struggle to get part time work. I knew people who managed it but I always tried to find work over summer and failed. If you have good experience in the jobs you are trying to get than it is doable but it certainly isn't the easiest place to get a job.

For instance, now one person can be employed to monitor the use of ten self-checkout machines, machines which previously would have been tills with a cashier each.

This leaves people with few qualifications, little or no job experience, health and mobility issues and any of the other myriad barriers to employment shit out of luck.

Just in case anyone wants to read more about this:

&gt;Between 2000-2008, Russia's economy saw the nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) double, climbing from 22nd to 11th largest in the world. The economy made real gains of an average 7% per year ( 1999: 6.5%, 2000: 10%, 2001: 5.7%, 2002: 4.9%, 2003: 7.3%, 2004: 7.2%, 2005: 6.4%, 2006: 8.2%, 2007: 8.5%, 2008: 5.2% ), making it the 6th largest economy in the world in GDP(PPP). In 2007, Russia's GDP exceeded that of 1990, meaning it has overcome the devastating consequences of the recession in the 1990s.

&gt;The industry grew by 75%, investments increased by 125%,and agricultural production and construction increased as well. Real incomes more than doubled and the average salary increased eightfold from $80 to $640.The volume of consumer credit between 2000–2006 increased 45 times, and during that same time period, the middle class grew from 8 million to 55 million, an increase of 7 times. The number of people living below the poverty line also decreased from 30% in 2000 to 14% in 2008

The story has been different since the crisis of 2008 (no longer a big surplus every year due to a massive drop in oil prices and growth is down to about the same level as European nations IIRC) but, overall, most recognise that Putins presidency has been a time of significant growth for the Russian economy.

AVB took 27 points from 16 games, good for 1.68 points/game. He also had to deal with 10 non-league games, and we had only fallen out of the Capital One Cup under AVB.

Sherwood has taken 25 points from the 14 reverse fixtures of games that we played under AVB, good for... 1.78 points per game. However, Sherwood's away record has been less than stellar (loss to Norwich, draw with Hull and West Brom)  and he hasn't yet played West Ham or Aston Villa.

Moreover, Sherwood has only had 5 non-league games to deal with, and has seen us crash out of the FA Cup (his first game in charge, I might add) and Europa League, including nearly falling out to Dnipro after losing in the Ukraine.

My point is that Timmy's record, while good, hasn't really been any better than AVB's, and he's had the benefit of fewer non-league distractions, a side that had 4 months to gel and settle into the premier league, and 6 extra games against opponents you would generally expect us to take points off.

I was too young at the time to remember the last time we won the league and this is the closest we've been that I can remember.

Am I going to be upset if we end up losing it? Yes. Does that mean I consider the season a failure? No. I don't think I'm only speaking for myself when I say that.

I know that there has been a huge improvement in the way we play this season, we've broke record and are at least a year ahead of where we intended to be. Next season we'll have Champions League football and we're now a more attractive team when it comes to transfers. I know all this, everybody does, but that's next season.

If we lose it on the last day of the season it's going to feel absolutely horrible, maybe some people will be able to get over it quickly and talk about next season, Champions League etc. but I honestly think it's going to take a bit of time for that to sink in to me, I'm barely thinking about next season at this stage, all I'm thinking about is these last few games.

Imagine if travellers stayed for a few weeks in a corner of a park and during that time litter-picked and weeded the grounds and repainted benches or something. How could that fail to make at least regional news? Combined with quotes from travellers saying things like 'We wanted to thank the local community; We wanted to give something back; We realize that respect is earned', etc. You don't have to be Max Clifford to know what a massive PR boon it would be.

&gt;Historically, Ajax was popularly seen as having ""Jewish roots"". Although not an official Jewish club like the city's WV-HEDW, Ajax has had a Jewish image since the 1930s when the home stadium was located next to a Jewish neighbourhood of [Amsterdam-Oost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam-Oost) and opponents saw many supporters walking through the Nieuwmarkt/Waterloopleinbuurt (de Jodenhoek) to get to the stadium.  The city of Amsterdam was historically referred to as a [Mokum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokum) city, Mokum (מקום) being the [Yiddish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish_language) word for ""place"" or ""safe haven"",  and as [anti-Semitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism) chants and name calling developed and intensified at the old [De Meer Stadion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Meer_Stadion) from frustrated supporters of opposing clubs, Ajax fans (few of whom are actually Jewish ) responded by embracing Ajax's ""Jewish"" identity: calling themselves ""super Jews"", chanting ""Jews, Jews"" (""Joden, Joden"") at games, and adopting Jewish symbols such as the [Star of David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David) and the [Israeli flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel).

That aside though this was the best result for Chelsea and they did what many other teams could not do. They played exactly how they needed to to get the 3 points and if they played any other way Liverpool would have put 3 past them. So what is wrong with this? Yes it was boring. But I think people should realize teams are out there to win first and bring entertainment second.

true,Messisfoot,null,null,"Dutch football is the predecessor to tiki-taka; Total football. It's based around the idea that any outfield player is comfortable playing on any position, and they switch it up to make man marking impossible, formations fluid, and the attack more dynamic. Tiki-taka is the same thing, but instead of players moving around the ball, the ball moves around the players.

AVB wasn't trying to play tiki-taka (I mistakenly identified it as this myself). AVB's tactic was to set-up a high-line that shortens the room you have to defend and you keep catching the opposition off-side. After you neutralize the opposition attack, you have a DM who can quickly spread out the ball (was supposed to be Moutinho), then have your wingers, usually inverted, engage in an endless barrage of attacks, crossing it to a poacher in the middle who can easily put away chances sent to them in the box (Falcao in Porto, was supposed to be Soldado here). 

I went back to look at some of his Porto matches, and the system was actually pretty impressive. Not at all tiki-taka and very Spursy. But it relies on two things; a pivot who can very quickly transition from defense to attack and good delivery to the poacher in the box. Without the pivot, the opposition has time organize their defense and the high line actually works against you since it compacts the opposition on their half, not giving you room to work with. And without good delivery to the poacher... well, we all see what Soldado is going through.

Terry was saying ""I really wish I wasn't a traveller"", poor bastard seemed to be like a black sheep - he conformed to none of the stereotypes as far as I could tell.

true,mORGAN_james,,Pembrokeshire,"I'm from Pembrokeshire (the county Solva is in) your near st Davids which is the smallest city in Britain because of its cathedral built by wales's saint st Davids (its a village) a lot of fantastic beaches in this area, blue lagoon is good for a nice day (the actual lagoon not the holiday park) red bull holds cliff diving there every now and again. Pentre Ifan (pen tree even) is in north Pembs too its like a miniature stone henge. Solva itself has a very quaint feel with a few nice shops, and a really good art gallery in the docks. a great restaurant is tavern zinc near the Presselli hills. 
another cool historical sight is st Govan's which is a really old church that was built into a cliff. 
if you want more adventure Pembrokeshire has a small theme park called Oakwood which is a great day out. there is also Heatherton which is more of an outdoor adventure center with archery paintball go carts etc. my personal favorite beach is broad haven south, it has a long walk to it past Bosherston Lilly ponds and among sand dunes but that is the south coast of Pembrokeshire about 40 minutes drive from Solva. st Davids has great beaches itself i don't know many of the more local quaint beaches of north Pembrokeshire being from Milford Haven. (30 minutes away from Solva)which has a few nice bars but its a bit of a shitty town.
if you want to be a classic tourist Tenby is the place to go, it does have really nice beaches and cafe's and restaurants (the kook a bar in particular is very nice, its Australian themed though) but because Tenby is so very nice over the summer you cant move for tourists and locals that flock there year after year. if your looking for a proper city with great culture the capital of Wales is Cardiff and its a very vibrant city. Avoid Swansea I'm in university here and its a grim city with very little on offer other than a great student nightlife. the drive up cardigan bay is also a nice drive.

true,piouiy,null,null,"&gt;Perhaps. But this is exactly what these bastards are doing. Weakening internet/cryptographic security, and violating our privacy rights on an industrial scale.

These are the leaks we've heard from a disgruntled former contractor which have been filtered through 2-3 newspapers (Guardian, Washington Post) (oh, and the Spiegel?). So there's no guarantee that we are getting the truth OR that it is the full version of what was leaked. Maybe Snowden leaked only the bad stuff, not the good. Maybe the newspapers only report the bad. We simply have no context to make judgements.

I agree that those you mentioned things are bad, but IIRC the NSA have helped numerous times to improve security protocols, right? (and yes, they definitely weakened some too).

&gt;People can be coerced to do all manner of morally repugnant things in a controlled environment and they quickly become the norm.

The Stanford Prison Experiment doesn't really apply here though. We, as general members of the public, don't know the facts. We don't know what methods they use, how many plots they have stopped (and could admit to) or what kind of information they have access to. 

And don't forget that one of their main jobs is spying on other countries to try and get the UK a tactic advantage in negotiations. That's not really morally repugnant to target other countries. And GCHQ are supposed to be protecting OUR systems from countries like China, Japan, Russia, Iran etc who try to hack and steal our secrets. In theory, if you are a UK lawyer, business owner or journalist, GCHQ should be on your side. Because make no mistake, those other countries DEFINITELY are trying to steal your stuff.

Don't get me wrong, I strongly support our rights to privacy, and clearly storing all internet traffic is way over-stepping their job responsibilities, but it's almost impossible for us to judge GCHQs actions accurately. We have a tiny piece of the picture from leaked documents filtered through the media (who won't release the raw documents for us to read ourselves), and GCHQ aren't exactly going to come clean about their actions either way. I don't see it worth getting outraged against because I don't believe they are evil, conspiring against the British public, trying to turn us into some dystopian slave race with big brother watching. 

What we need is a proper inquiry by a trusted judge with GCHQ giving him full disclosure of what they do, telling him how far these programs go and he will have to look at the laws and determine whether they broke any and whether the laws are adequate to balance security and privacy. GCHQ aren't going to ""come clean"", and the public can do pretty much bugger all at this point.

Its this kind of unjust, bias, bullshit hypocrisy that causes animosity between Liverpool and other groups, and its hard to buy into their ""victim"" sentiment when they are getting away with things like this under the guise of paying tribute to Hillsborough.

true,truub,null,null,"I am not religious, I still however find your views and 'solutions' objectionable and would lead to a hate filled society.

The view that Christianity held back education and science is misguided and blinkered. The bible was responsible for teaching untold numbers to read and write. The church founded scores of schools and universities, some of the greatest scientific minds that have ever existed come from religious backgrounds and/or were deeply religious. Christianity doesn't always play nice with science but it's contribution in the field of education and advancement of knowledge has been immense.

You criticize the church for intolerant views yet this proposal practices its own sinister brand of fascism and intolerance. Seizing the Church's property and banning religious activity in them? Really?

The rich can't fully meet Jesus' expectations so Jesus' teachings should be abandoned by them? Because if a goal isn't easily achievable, you should give up on it! Great philosphy that.

Alternatives to god haven't been explored? There are religions that don't involve worshipping gods, do into any book store and you can probably find a few dozen books on various forms of spirituality and ways of life that aren't in themselves religious. Then there's this whole thing called ""Science""...

No personal reflection and lifestyle education in School? You never had general studies? Banning RE would narrow people's cultural knowledge. You're hardly going to create a better society by ensuring kids don't learn about cultures and ways other than their own.

Science taking priority over personal morals and spirituality? That's an incredibly dark path to go down, leads to the whole ""greater good"" can of worms.",0,1398689006,null,0,false,0,ch42lnn,t3_246c7m,t1_ch42lnn,t3_246c7m,null,1433556143,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The sheer hatred of the girls who dropped out of school and fell into a council house, designer clothes that i could never afford, what i assumed to be a much better lifestyle than mines. Until it happens to you and you realise their perceived lifestyle is probably being paid in weekly instalments and they are in more debt than i could ever imagine.

For some people though its a basic human instinct, I started to feel guilty about my IUD, it was like an uncontrollable urge to get that thing out of me. I really can't explain it, i HAD to have a baby. I was lucky and had a decent paying job, a great family around me to provide childcare, but i often think if i didn't have all that would it have stopped me? 

That said, the £20 a week in child benefit is literally no incentive to anyone to have a child. It costs 5 times that when you add up the big purchases you have to make, not to mention the sacrifice in lifestyle, holidays now costing into the thousands, £20 for a weekend in the pub is a lot cheaper than a family day out at the zoo or cinema. We shouldn't have to subsidise other peoples children, but the desire to have them is never going to go away, and until that happens i do not see how a society can let children suffer in poverty, which many would do without the help of Tax Credits and housing benefits.

That people movement died out a long time ago thanks to the Left's betrayals in favor of the petit bourgeoise. Try and start one now and see how far you get before someone demands a ""progressive stack"" and for the ""white straight men"" to shut up and do what they're told by some middle-class Guardianista cunt. 

&gt;An anti-migration policy does nothing for working class people

It prevents wage dumping and prevents them from just importing people to replace troublesome unionized workers. If you don't see the value in that then you're either ideologically blinded or one of those unaffected.

&gt;its that it actively distracts from the fact that representative democracy in the UK is completely failing the working class

It is the very response to it failing the working class. Not only does UKIP cause massive worry among the people most responsible, both politicians and their middle class voters, it also neatly lines up with many working class values of the people that the left so charitably dubbed the ""trash proles"". 

&gt;Immigrant and British national should stand united

More horseshit about proletarian internationalism? Are you really working class or just another middle class university kid with delusions about what it actually means?

You can't unionize with people when they're acting in their own ethnochauvinistic interests half the time and that's essentially the core of the left's betrayal. It wasn't enough that they dumped workers for the Mondeo Man, they also made it clear their opinions were inherently on the level of nazis by sheer identity politics, wether ""patriarchical"", ""colonial"" or worse.

His whole wealth is based on him covering up celebrities' scandals by manipulating the media.

Only a manager with a team that have attacking force like Madrid, Barca or Bayern would employ head on attacking tactic against Liverpool at Anfield. Because their attacking power would be a massive pressure for Liverpool, it practically a defense on its own.  
  
Us, and many other PL teams this year, simply don't have that much of fire power. If you think other wise, just look at our striker selection. Not to mention Oscar dip in form and Hazard injury, plus Atletico 2nd leg at home.  
  
Liverpool thrive on explosive start and riding that momentum, especially at Anfield, many team simply butchered at the first 10-15 minutes and simply gave up and just lost momentum. Just like Frank Lampard said on the post match interview, our first goal is to just shut them up and frustrate them, because eventually they will lost concentration because they are not used to being shut off.

true,lapin7,null,null,"Yes it is, if you're a Liverpool fan who can't understand why then you need to have a look at yourself.

They're equating Hillsborough and the subsequent cover-up to what happened at Heysel in a flippant way. They're suggesting that Liverpool fans voluntarily killed Juventus fans and there's some form of 'justice' necessary or even possible in relation to Heysel. In case you're unaware there were many Liverpool fans convicted of involuntary manslaughter following that tragedy, even though criminally negligent standards of crowd control and a crumbling, unsafe stadium had more to do with what happened (though that's not really something I'm prepared to debate here).

What's more important is that you need to realise when chelsea and Man Utd fans sing 'Justice for the 39', they couldn't give two shits about the Juventus fans, they're actually appropriating the deaths of dozens of innocent people in an expression of their poisonous tribal hatred. Like when Liverpool fans used to sing about Munich in the 1980s, but in my opinion this is far more twisted. Not only does it disgrace the Juventus fans who died, it is a total disgrace to the Hillsborough victims and campaigners because it tries to make a 'game' of the Justice Campaign, somehow suggesting that Liverpool fans and families who've given so much time, money and emotion to the campaign have done so simply because it was 'their' football fans who died. Rather than the injustice that occurred. We know how much abuse and scorn the Justice Campaigners have had to endure simply because they insisted upon what has recently been demonstrated by official enquiry. These people, when they sing 'Justice for the 39', they're doing it gleefully as if they're 'one-upping' the other team. They think it's on a level with us singing about out 5 European Cups and 18 Leagues. They're wearing a terrible human catastrophe as a badge of pride, as if it's like saying that Norwich fans have webbed feet - they have so little respect for those who died that they feel the right to sing about them in that way.

This, I consider, has been a deliberate political policy form the the early 80's onwards ...and signing on daily is a means to that end, like all the social security changes, punishing the ill and disabled, made by IDS (Social security NOT WELFARE, as the word has been introduced into current discourse)

There are NOT enough jobs to fufill the concept of full employment employment (as there is no political will to do so, from the 'left').. So demanding daily signing on is purely designed to punish, cower and drive people from the benefits they are entitled too.

&gt;

&gt;A __spraydeck__ (or __spraycover__ or __sprayskirt__) is a flexible cover for a [boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat), in particular for a [kayak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak) or a [canoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoe). It is used in [whitewater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewater), inclement weather or sport to prevent water from entering the boat while allowing one or more passengers to sit in the boat and propel the boat by [paddling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddling) or [rowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercraft_rowing).

&gt;A spraydeck is a sheet made out of water-tight [cloth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloth) (for example, rubberized or impregnated cloth) sized to fit over the opening, or cockpit, of the canoe or kayak.

&gt;A spraydeck has an opening for each passenger. Each opening likewise is encircled by a line or elastic string running in a hollow seam on the edge of the hole. This makes it possible to tighten the spraydeck around the body of the passenger.

However,*traveling* East of the Black Sea, North of the Arctic Circle, and go a breakaway Moldovan state **was** taxing, far more than going to Dnipro (where we lost) or Lisbon (for a game that was mostly a formality) and AVB had to juggle more games at all, which means he has to make more changes to the team and get more combinations of players to work together. I'm not saying he was successful, but Timmy has basically trotted out the same team until it gets clobbered, then tried again.

My point is that Timmy hasn't had to cope with many of the issues that AVB did, and has been only marginally better; a tenth of a point per game.

You're right to point out that the Soton, WBA, and Stoke games were all difficult ones, but all our wins (including the latest) were nervy 1 goal wins where we were pinned back in our own box by a team several places below us in the table. And we have no way of knowing if AVB would've gotten the same results against them, so in terms comparing the managers, they're useless.

More than anything, I think this proves that Timmy isn't fit to be our manager. We've performed roughly the same under AVB and Sherwood, except user AVB the questions were ""where's his tactical genius?"" Or ""why isn't he doing better?"" - people knew AVB had the capacity to be a better manager than  the team was showing. Under Sherwood, it's been all ""look at the results!"" And ""it may not always be pretty, but he wins!"".

Defending is fine. Liverpool have done plenty of it themselves this year, with some results ground out after late onslaughts from opponents.

Just FYI, Sports Club Stats has two prediction methods. one is with each outcome equally likely; they call it 50/50. Each out come of a match, win/lose/draw has a prob. of ~33.33%

The other method that Sports Club Stats uses is a weighted probability, so they assign slightly higher probabilities to the home team and the team with the best form over recent matches. That is the default view on their site.

Bloomberg Sports uses a much more sophisticated model. They use the attributes of teams from recent games, games earlier in the season and historical results to estimate the number of goals each team are likely to score and concede against that specific opposition. Then they run many repeated simulations of the games. and they use that to report the probabilities.

The fact that these two wildly different methods give very similar results seems to indicate they are probably fairly close to the real empirical probabilities. ",0,1398696055,null,0,1398696634,0,ch45164,t3_246sp1,t1_ch45164,t3_246sp1,null,1433557289,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

So anyone who has ever exaggerated his (or presumably her) status and
abilities to impress someone of the opposite sex is potentially
guilty; that is to say, to a first approximation 100% of the adult
population.

The trial, like the others of its ilk, is a fine vignette of our
times.  Complainants who are part of a Designated Victim Group (here,
women) tear down someone who makes a suitable target to flatter the
self-righteous prejudices of the mob.  A rich, old white heterosexual
man is debarred from all DVGs and the prosecutors have at last ""got
one"".

Both the trial and the repulsive vengefulness of the mob shown in the

our civilisation.

When I was younger going through some of the 'bad' parts of London with my mates for the first time a few of them opted to carry knives with them out of fear. We were all pretty much sold on the idea that something would happen and we would need something to scare off some crazed attacker (ironically likely to be carrying a knife if we believed what we were told)

Thankfully absolutely nothing happened and those that took knives with them spent the day more paranoid about the sharp object in their pocket bringing attention to them and a few opted to dispose of their flimsy pen knives/ scaples as soon as we got to our destination.

Thankfully no one took knives with them again ,whether it was because they realized that there was actually no reason for them or the new knife laws came in that we understood to mean guaranteed prison time.

But it seem you know what it is *you* want out of a party, at that point look to their websites and listen to their members first hand rather than through the press filter. Do the research yourself on what they intend. I think in the case of some social issues UKIP is careful to *not* have any official policy as they *know* the vast majority of their support runs counter to the prevailing social view. Farage has himself ducked the issue, and on a recent LBC interview it was clear he personally was against same sex marriage.

I'd say the thrust of my comment was what *really* affects you. Imagined Muslim clerics jumping out at you is one of those times you're letting press and internet fear mongering get the better of you. I was born here in London and lived my entire adult life here and don't recall ever being accosted by a Muslim to turn to Islam once, so why it would be a fear I would base my hard fought vote on is anyones guess. I've had more bother from Christian street evangelists than Muslims.

The other thing I take issue with is conflating that extremism with foreigners. You want to kick out people spreading extremist views, but what if they're born here like the vast majority of them are?

&gt;The sad fact of the world is that people are racist.

Yes, but it would be equally racist were I, as you suggest, to *assume* every white character on television and film *is* a racist until explicitly shown that to be untrue.

&gt;In to ""Kill a Mockingbird"" is it not a plot point that Atticus Finch is not a racist?

Yes, but I think you'll find racism is an *actual* central theme of the book. It's not a matter of fact thing, it's deliberate, explicitly so. Race is not a factor in every film ever created featuring a multi ethnic cast. That's simply absurd.

&gt;In the tv show, they handcuff Merle to the roof because he was agitated by t-dog and acting in a racist manner towards him. His whole arc would have changed if he was not racist or if t-dog was white.

Yes but here we again are dealing with *explicit* racism that is a central part of the storyline. They wrote it in on purpose man, how do you not get that? There's a massive difference in that and Morgan simply being a guy.

&gt;Morgan and his son are the first characters that we see. Up until that point all we know is there are zombies, Rick is white and a sheriff that had been left shot in a hospital.

And there again we get back to me having to assume he's a racist until a character is explicitly presented to refute such thoughts.

&gt;T-Dog isn't in the comics, neither is Jacqui.

Which sort of goes to the heart of this whole conversation about CHANGING THE TV SHOW IN WAYS TO MAKE IT A BETTER TV SHOW! I mean you argue they simply *can't* change things from the comic then reference a *massive* change from the comic to drive your point home. Do you see why I'm sitting here mouth agape at this point?

&gt;And how racist is that to lump Asian-American characters into the same boat as Black Characters?

Are you simply trolling now? I mean, are you young or special needs? How have the simple nuances of conversation and inference just passed you by? Is an Asian character *not* an ethnic minority too? I mean seeing as we're assuming all white guys are racists now, do Asian guys get a special pass I don't get? Lumping in? You're being beyond daft now.

You then have two other central midfielders either side of him playing as a pair higher up the pitch.

Oh fuck off, Eriksen is on the left to give him fewer defensive responsibilities, similar to how 'arry blooded Modric on the left of a midfield 4, and Chadli has been performing well. 

I'm not saying it's our best line-up but if it's working, why change it?

Section 5. [**Dialect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics#Dialect) of article  [**Linguistics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;A dialect is a [variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics\)) of [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language) that is characteristic of a particular group among the language speakers.  The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics\)) or a [discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse), where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages too) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that a ""[language is a dialect with an army and navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_is_a_dialect_with_an_army_and_navy)"" is attributed as a definition formulated by [Max Weinreich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weinreich).

Misportray what I wrote to avoid actually answering the arguments I see.

&gt;Don't form a group to collectively bargain

The people's movements that allowed unionization enough power in the physical labour market is gone due to the left's betrayal. 

&gt;Immigration is the problem

Immigration is a problem.

&gt;You can't be working class if you talk a certain way

You can be, but when you espouse clearly cosmopolitan middle class values and talk from the viewpoint of someone who've probably never spent an evening with a working class person it's hard to believe you are one.

&gt;The left betrayal, despite 35 years of right wing union bashing

What of it? 

The Tories being cunts doesn't change the fact that the Left utterly betrayed the workers. In fact in terms of their political involvement I would say the New Labour and their supporters are more hostile to workers than the Tories, if only for the fact that the latter doesn't pretend to represent them like Labour does.

&gt;Everyone else is a Nazi.

I take it you're being deliberately obtuse and that you're just not illiterate.

&gt;Rhetorical argument about ""wrong neighbourhoods"" 

The divide is clearly not ""rhetorical"" as a visit to the local ghetto would tell you.

&gt;You really don't have the world figured out half as well as you think you do.

Rich coming from a walking stereotype of a chardonnay socialist.

&gt;UKIP is a party deliberately created and funded by right wingers to form divisions British society

Yeah right. It's UKIP that created the divisions and not your identity politics and pure hatred of actual working people.

&gt;there is no interest in ordinary people

So just like the other politicals then?

Some would call that a pessimistic stance. I prefer the optimistic stance, but I also believe in ""Trust But verify"".

As for the rest,

Racism doesn't have to be explicit, we are not all five year olds. Once again the Walking Dead is about humans, about tribalism, us vs them, racism plays a part in that.

The Walking Dead is a confused and muddled tv show, that used two seasons in the prison in what should have taken one. None of the changes they have made have made a better tv show, unlike GoT.

&gt;Are you simply trolling now? I mean, are you young or special needs? How have the simple nuances of conversation and inference just passed you by?

&gt;Are you simply trolling now? I mean, are you young or special needs? How have the simple nuances of conversation and inference just passed you by? Is an Asian character not an ethnic minority too? I mean seeing as we're assuming all white guys are racists now, do Asian guys get a special pass I don't get? Lumping in? You're being beyond daft now.

You are lumping ethnic minorities all in the same boat, when to anyone it should be obvious that they are all different and worthy of consideration separate to one another as individuals. At the end there you go into another fit of ranting so I am not even really sure what you are trying to say.

Just because Chelsea gave Liverpool possession and allowed people like Gerard to take impossible shots does not mean they were dominated. You did not ""dig in a bit deeper"", you just looked at the end of game stats without considering the actual gameplay.

The only way you credit Sherwood more for those games is if you truly feel that AVB wouldn't have gotten the same points from those games, and I think that's just silly. We have no reason to believe, given that AVB lost precisely 1 game against a team lower in the table, that he would've dropped points in those games.

And yes, we did have some Nervy, unconvincing wins earlier in this year; but, as I did many times during AVB's tenure, I would point to the fact that we effectively brought in 10 new players over the summer who AVB had to fit together; The Baldini 7, plus Townsend, Rose, and Kaboul, latter 3 of whom had played precisely 4 games *ever* under AVB; all of which were from Kaboul, before his injury last year.

Tim has none of those ""excuses"" if you want to call them that; he inherited a team that had been playing together for 4 months, and he promptly brought in a player [who had been an insubordinate cunt to the previous manager](http://www.espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1709806/emmanuel-adebayor-reveals-andre-villas-boas-fallouts?cc=5901) and Tim was suddenly the next Sir Bobby Robson.

Sandro sitting in front of the defence, Eriksen and Paulinho either side (in the cm3) playing as a pair in front. Chadli and Lamela/Townsend playing off the striker from wide. Setting up like that negates the weaknesses of all those players and promotes their strengths.

A football club isn't something you can just 'chose' to support, like you'd chose what to have for breakfast. To have a real affinity with a club you need to be born into it, to grow up around it, to live with it. To wear it on your sleeve. You need to experience the highs and the lows, first hand, and be there no matter what. You need to experience the rivalry, the hostility and banter with rival fans, first hand. You need to really care about what happens to the club.

You'll never get that if you just 'chose' a club.

And you'll never quite understand the differences I highlight, or maybe you will.

That said, I do recognise that in time, you will care about the club. Just in a different way to the way we do. Yours will be a different kind of support and affinity, and that's sweet. We can't all be born into City and live in Manchester.

I hope you do mean what you said above, but I hope it's never tested!

Do not be that fan. We are City, we're better than that. Take pride in what City do, and support us in your own way, but don't be the arrogant gloating fan we all unanimously despise.

But you need to swallow the fact that a chance has been blown. Big time. A chance that we may not have (well fuck I wish we do!) anytime soon. I hope I am wrong. 

Steven Gerrard is a bonafide Liverpool legend. But. It was down to him last night. As it was down to Kolo in the West Brom game. Individual errors have been our bane.

And that error last night is squarely down to Steven Gerrard.

Second of all, I don't think you should say that.  Only say what you actually mean and feel. When you start to obtain a genuine dislike for United, by all means curse them all you like. But simply regurgitating common feelings and phrases of City supporters cheapens them.

It doesn't have to be the same attitude as someone whose supported the club for 50 years, in fact it shouldn't be. But what it should be is, an attitude you develop for yourself through loyal support of your team. That's why people hate so called 'plastic fans'.

true,SlindsayUK,cnty-wales,Wales - Swansea,"I'm in the same boat except that I'm white British and 7 years younger than you. I moved a long way for work a couple of years ago and am currently having a pretty miserable time of it. I don't think it's to do with ethnicity so much as it is the fact that British adults past their late 20s are, by and the large, incredibly hard to make friends with. 

People seem to have their social circles very much nailed down by this point and in general aren't interested in letting new people into them. The activity partners thing runs very true for me, I went to a couple of sports clubs after moving and ended up just not enjoying it enough to feel like making the effort of going back to them because I simply didn't end up talking to other people - I just turned up and trained and after class I'd never really be able to chat with anyone.

In fact, in the last 2 years the only friends I did end up making were not British as well - part of me wants to think that might be an outsider hanging together thing but they had the exact same observations that you have about British culture and how hard it is to actually make friends with people. 

Having said that, it could be an ethnicity thing as well as I actually encounter poor reactions from some people because I'm English and I live and work in Wales. Not playful ""an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman walk into a bar"" banter but actual surliness. This is an incredibly unpopular thing to say though - the friends I do have back home look at me like I'm committing some sort of blasphemy when I suggest that certain places in the UK aren't very nice to outsiders.

The ISA increase is being raised to £15k later this year, so £800-£1000 a month won't quite fill it. Top the rest off from the £12k.  

As for your monthly contributions, what are your long term goals? What are you saving for? Personally, if I were you, I'd ensure that my pension contributions were high enough that I was at no risk of raising my tax threshold. You'll get an instant 45% return (off the top of my head, might be a bit off) from higher contributions, and 23% for lower contributions, but it does mean you can't touch it for 30 years.  

As for where to put it, it's up to you and your level of risk. An index fund is a decent bet for the stock market, but it's still volatile. Do not put anything in an index fund that you'll need back in the next 5-10 years, the last thing you want to do is be forced to sell at a low. Keep some in cash or cash-equivalent.  

For outside your ISA, there's a regular saver from First Direct offering 6%, there's a current account from Nationwide offering 5% on credit balances up to £2,500 (I think), and a few other similar offerings, but you'll be taxed.

We can understand Pellegrini's preference to field Ferna and Mr Toure over Javi but he has held the midfield well whenever called upon. That allows Mr Toure to venture forward and put the opposing backline on pressure. What I mean is Ferna and Yaya shares that holding midfielding position until either of them gets substituted over and Javi does that job tremendously all alone. His attitude is super and does really well whenever called upon. He doesn't talk too much about not getting enough playtime either.

However, like HyperactiveToast noted, he doesn't have that creative vision that Yaya or Ferna brings to the table. He is a big lad and his height and strength adds a little something to stabilise the defence. I remember one time (I think it was a game against Hull) when Kompany was shown a red card around the 10 minute mark and he performed really well as a makeshift central defender. The offside trap in that game was great to watch too.

true,ocicu,null,null,"&gt; I have not yet, in my 28 years on this planet, had a positive experience with a member of the Roma traveler community.

Travellers generally seem to say that they haven't had very positive experiences with settled people either.  It's just like every ethnic conflict ever: there isn't a ""good"" side and an ""evil"" side, there are just two groups of humans who each hold the other group to a higher standard than their group.  Though when one group is in the majority and holds all the political and economic power, they obviously hold the keys to ending the conflict.

&gt; [long list of anecdotes]

In most of these cases, you don't seem to make it very clear how you knew the people involved were travellers.  Do you think, in some cases, you might have assumed that they were travellers when, in fact, they weren't?  Do you think, in other cases, you might have been less likely to notice that they were travellers if they hadn't been causing trouble?  There are all kinds of cognitive biases that can lead us into making unwarranted conclusions based on things like that.

&gt; What has prompted this post however was an incident a few days ago. I was in the supermarket having finished work buying some bread. I presume it had just been marked down as there was a group of people hanging round it. I came to the side of a woman and her female friend who were loading a small trolley with loaves. I picked up 6-8 loaves(business order) from the middle shelf while they were emptying the bottom and put it in my trolley. The woman closest to me then turned and started to almost shout at me in her language whilst trying to snatch the bread from my trolley. The more I moved(I thought I was in her way) the more aggressive she became to the point where technically, as per the letter of the law I was assaulted as she was trying to push past me to the trolley now in the middle of the aisle. I walked away to a deluge of what I presumed to be insults and abuse(bread intact I'm pleased to say)

Yes, this is definitely down to gypsy evilness.  It couldn't possibly have been down to a misunderstanding or a cultural difference or because they were having a really bad day or something.  You're lucky they didn't put a curse on you.

&gt; Am I racist?

Well, yes, but clearly the point of this post was that you knew most of the people on this sub would say no and that anyone going so far as to suggest that travellers are human would be downvoted into oblivion.

""Problem is the world of tax is not black and white and the legislation can be vague
 
This is not too dis-similar to what Philip Green did, the owner of Debenhams. The UK tax system basically allows assets to pass from husband to wife with no tax charge, that has been long established and indeed a significant proportion of the population do this on a regular basis. So no avoidance at that level.
 
The difference is that Bernie's then wife was not a UK domicile. Hence she sould set up an offshore Trust quite legitimately. If the money stays within the Trust then no tax in the UK. Any amounts remitted to the UK would be subject to UK tax.
 
The case here was that HMRC were trying to argue that Bernie was in control of the Trust and as a UK domiciled individual he would have been subject to tax on the income and gains (subject to where his tax residiency is). The rules were probably a bit different in 1995 as well 
 
The payments he now gets from his ex wife are probably considered maintenance payments and these are tax free in the UK - are for all taxpayers
 
OK it is all very clever and would have cost a fortune to set up, but that set up cost and ensuing there is a lot of complexity showing that Bernie could not and was not in control of the Trust or setting up then HMRC probably had to take a view that as the legislation stood the chances of getting a favourable result were small. As Neal M says the £10m could be tax due on what his wife has brought in to the UK. The issue is the drafting of the legislation, by the govt of the day not that HMRC did a deal.
 
I have just done a contract settlement with HMRC for a client, settled at about £200k, worse case scenario the client could have been in for £3m or alternatively it could have had a refund of £0.5m. It was a deal because the nature of the clients activities and what is the right accounting treatment isn't in any textbook or legislation so in the end a pragmatic solution was reached. Has the UK taxpayer been done as in the media this would be reported as HMRC had done a deal costing it £2.5m, when my client could argue it has overpaid £700k. The facts of these tax avoidance cases are never reported because 1) it is not a story and 2) the journalist does not understand the tax system.

There's more to do at home. 20 years ago, you might have a SNES, but they were mainly for kids. Now almost every 18-30 bloke has a PS3 or Xbox360. Not to mention more Tv channels and on demand, Netflix (well, the internet in general).  

There's the change in drinking culture too, people didn't really drink at home, now they do. People used to meet up at the local before going to town on a Saturday night, now they pre-drink at home, or just use mobiles to meet in town (no ""we're to the left of the bar in wetherspoons, see you soon"" without mobile phones)

He was utter garbage last season. He has some major flaws to his game, but last season he couldn't even adapt to the pace of the English game.

As of now?

His improvement has been such that I see him as a reasonable member of the squad.

He has his limits, but he provides a specific role, and he's reasonably good at what he does. He has improved to the degree that I'd be happy to see him stay at City this summer, while I used to be totally against the idea.

He's not someone we should be relying on regularly, simply because he isn't of the required standard.

Fernando, who we've been linked with heavily, would be a significant upgrade. Which would make Garcia 4th choice.

If he'd be happy to stay in those circumstances, then fair enough. But given the wage he likely commands, I think we could get a similar player for much less cost in terms of wages.

One thing Garcia will never life up to is his transfer fee.

/u/Samson-Strange covers off quite a bit below. I'd add:

Start scrounging bits to make up a tool kit from friends and family. Most people have more hammers, screwdrivers etc than they need. Take anything they'll give you, including rawl plugs! Buy yourself a £20 handheld drill from B&amp;Q, charge it up before you move. Also buy (usually extra) masonry drillbits, you'll need both (see also masonry rawl plugs). Get some duct tape for emergencies (and just about anything really). Find out where your fuse box is and what sort of fuses it has in it; buy replacements immediately. 

Register with a doctor's surgery, or try to. Same with dentist and anything else like that you'd need. 

If you're living on your own, remember to claim the single person's discount for council tax. 

Get some numbers of local takeaways, a plumber and electrician and keep them on a piece of paper or a smartphone in case anything goes wrong on the day or before you get internet (unless you can do this in your smartphone and know your 3G will work - which mine BARELY does in my flat, unbeknown to me until it was too late). 

Start roping people into helping you move NOW so you don't panic nearer the time. Always anticipate that you're going to get the keys hours late and make sure people helping/the van have leway for this. leaway? Leeway. WHATEVER WAY.

Sign up to Freecycle for the area and get the most regular alerts you can; I shit you not, I've seen Redditors furnish entire flats from freecycle and Craigslist. 

Be prepared to invest in an expensive mattress. Cheap mattresses are a false economy (although you can get away with them if you have a memory foam topper - speaking of which, full memory foam mattresses are very difficult to shag on - but my 3 inch memory topper was fine, best of both worlds). 

When friends and family ask you what you want for a moving in present, think practical: don't ask for a nice rug, get a good stainless steel saucepan set, really good quality baking trays (I always use vitreous enamel), heavy-based frying pans, a food processor, stuff like that. /u/Invader-Strange can probably help, though he'll direct you to extortionate catering equipment.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; You need to take into account yields on any deposit that you could invest

No. You really don't. Anybody reading this, about to buy a property, ignore this. You don't need to ""start thinking about yields vs investment"". Above all, there are few investment opportunities that will see 8% above inflation growth this year. It is as a consequence of the relatively high yields in the housing market that it has become such a reserve for capital investment.

There are not many investments where you can put £300,000 in, and 25 years later take out (in todays money) something *probably* worth closer to £500,000. **AND** worst case, even if you lose money on it, it's still a home with real functional value... i.e. you can live in it. Even if you suffered a catastrophic 50% devaluation, you'd get £150,000 back in 25 years. If you rent for 25 years, you'll get £0.00 back. The danger is if you plan to move in that 25 years (before the mortgage is cleared) then you could end up in negative equity - basically stuck either being in debt with no house, or in a devalued house you don't want to be in anymore.

&gt; A mortgage is just renting money, after all.

Not really. A mortgage is a mortgage, and rent is rent. That's why they have different names. When you rent, you lose 100% of what you put in and have no ownership over your ""investment"" beyond the terms of the rental contract. 

With a mortgage, contrary to popular opinion you own the house with a debt to the bank who own the mortgage on it. Written into that mortgage is the effect that if you don't pay it, ownership of the house reverts to the bank. 

&gt; There's a whole complex series of financial calculations that you've ignored which you need to make before you can just say that buying is always financially better than renting.

I totally disagree with this. There are, as I have said, plenty of good arguments for renting. But if you are talking about long term economic investments - these aren't good arguments. Buying wins hands down - that's effectively why people want to buy. The benefits of renting are more situational like being able to retain your mobility/move where the work is (i.e. what people mean when they say *""Not being tied down by a mortgage""*) and being able to bail out of a property within 6-12 months if it turns out horribly wrong - which could be very hard with a mortgage.

&gt; People always ignore the not-insignificant maintenance and insurance costs of owning a house

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; So you're not sure being accurate about what's happening to 42% of the monthly repayment is ""important"" to the OP? That's er, interesting. 

No, it's not important. It's debt, that's how debt works. You borrow money from the bank, and pay back more money. That's how banks make profit and stay in business and pay their staff/overheads. Unless you have £325,000 available to purchase a property outright, then your only option is to mortgage it. Is it important that 10% of a tenants fees might be to a property management company? - No of course not - the bottom line is it costs what it costs. The same is true of the mortgage. 

&gt; your statement about ""paying yourself"" the full sum of the monthly mortgage payment was false. 

I actually pointed out that for most properties of that value, you would borrow around £325,000 minus the deposit, and pay back around £475,000 over a 25 year mortgage at standard rates. **However**, most predictions suggest the property will actually be worth more than (inflation adjusted) the £475,000 due to above inflation rises in the value of property - at least if trends over the last 40 years are correct, and if population trends pan out as we expect. Obviously if the population suddenly declines enormously (like a pandemic flu outbreak) or someone starts building vast quantities of superior quality properties then the prices will be driven down. But right now, the supply:demand element of the market has driven prices up fairly consistently over the long term. So the interest payments to the bank, are in the long term negated by capital gains on the investment. 

&gt; you are effectively taking out a huge leveraged bet on future property price rises, which at this point in time, with interest rates at 300 year lows, may be very risky to assume.

As I alluded to above, that is indeed correct. Whilst all the predictors say the prices will continue to rise, that is not to say there are not things that could drive them down rapidly.

This is my primary argument. I'm suggesting that Sherwood has performed well. Not that he's the next Robson or whoever. I'm just saying he has done well. Also a quarter of a point is much better than AVBs. Again, AVB was on track for 64 pts over 38, while Sherwood is 74 over 38. So that quarter of a point may not seem like much to you, but how about you look at the big picture? 64 pts over the past 2 or 3 years is good enough for 6th or 5th place. 74 is enough for 3rd or 4th. So yes, 6th place is bad enough to be fired and 3rd place is good enough to stay. That isn't a baffling standard to hold him. Nobody is calling Sherwood a genius- certainly not me. But 10 pts is better. 10 pts is the difference between Bale, Modric, VDV, Hazard, Willian, and eveyr other star we've missed out on because we couldn't get 0.25 pts each match. Every point matters, so if Sherwood could get us performing better then why undermine that?

As a few people here have pointed out, the friendships made during the adolescent years seem to be the ones that stick. Personally, most of my close pals are the people I was mates with between the years of 16-19ish. There are maybe one or two people I've met since then who I count as friends, but my closest mates are definitely those I've known since I was a callow youth.

Why this is the case, I do not know, maybe it's cultural, I sort of imagine that people in the US aren't quite as susceptible to this kind of thing as it's more the norm for them to move around in adulthood. It could be some kind of neurological imprinting thingy, or maybe just that we bond with/trust people who we've known for longer.

true,BonoboUK,null,null,"&gt;It wasn't uproar, it was correcting and/or refuting. What Camleron said was essentially pandering to religious groups and stoking future arguments that could result in religious privilege being kept the same, or increased, in society, laws etc. British people are becoming less and less religious. This is an undeniable fact yet we, in general, are constantly being told by various areas of government, the media and groups that we are religious, that we think religion is important and that religion has a major role to play. This simply isn't true - at least certainly religion doesn't have anything that can't be, or isn't, done by other non-religious groups.

I'm not denying Britain is becoming less religious, and I'm not even against that, I'm simply stating that, given so much of our civil ceromonies / processes involve Christianity, it is foolish to try and suggest otherwise. Absolutely alternative options are available, but they're not taken up. I don't think the issue here is ""We're constantly being told religion has a major part to play""... Cameron said England is a Christian country. It's a statement of fact, not of intent.

&gt; Many had to campaign and fight for the right to affirm rather than swear on the bible - including in Parliament (Charles Bradlaugh being the appropriate figure to cite to reflect this). How many people know they can affirm rather than swear on the bible? How often do you see it in court room or police dramas? Just because it's still done a good deal doesn't really indicate religiosity. In any case there are such factors as social pressures involved. Did you hear about Cherie Booth-Blair's comments a couple of years back?

You are precisely proving the point. I'm not suggesting that every time the Bible is brought out everyone stares at it and remains silent in religious obedience... they view it as a tiresome tradition. But they do it. Because it is the tradition, the country that they're in just does it that way.

&gt; Even if this were true (jay_vee has demonstrated otherwise) is that because people feel Christian, or because they think they're supposed to, or because it's a pretty building and ceremony?

As I replied below, he most certainly has not demonstrated otherwise. His stats linked to show overall wedding rates in various venues in the UK from the 60's up until present day. 

Atheistic venues have seen a rise from 40% to 60% in that time. Alongside a 300% increase in the number of atheists and a staggering decline in practicing Christians. The chart also completely ignores financial pressures, and where people would choose to get married. I find it pretty hard to believe a majority of atheists would get married in a civil venue vs a church, however perhaps my bias is coming through.

&gt; When we have had laws that require people to attend church on a Sunday, it's somewhat unfair to claim that ""We were Christian"" - how could you not be, when the law required it? Obviously that was repealed (not entirely sure when) but the point stands in outlining how the claim is still made with regard to other things i.e.

Nobody ever suggested that was the case. I've simply stated how every major milestone event in British life tends to happen in churches. No reference to ""It was then so it should be now"". 

You've also completely neglected to discuss christenings, funerals, etc... If you want to link to a chart of how many atheists would chose a 'civil' funeral (do they even exist?) over a church service I'd be happy to see that.

Your main argument against Britain being a Christian country is listing how hard people have fought to avoid having to reference anything to do with Christianity. And you're absolutely right - the law states it's not required even in court.

But it's *precisely* because of this that Britain is a Christian country. You're right, it's not required. But it's still done, in the vast majority of instances.",0,1398710784,null,0,false,0,ch4bykx,t3_243dwr,t1_ch4bykx,t1_ch3e7jp,null,1433560619,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Girlwithnousername,null,null,"&gt;I have been taking notes but they are often that detailed that I'm revising too little!

You need to fully understand the topic; if you're taking too many notes you probably aren't fully understanding it or you're trying to note take whilst reading. Stop doing that. Try this: open the book, read the contents, familiarise yourself with how the book is set out. Then flip through each page and read the headings and the headings of any highlighted boxes/text. Then start on a chapter and read it; don't make notes at this stage, just try to read and absorb and understand. At this stage if you don't understand, go back and try again. If 'what ifs' are bugging you, they may be covered later, but you should already have an idea of what's coming because you've already flipped through the book, so they should distract you a bit less than if you don't use this method. 

After you've read and fully understood, that's when you go back to the beginning and start taking notes. I'm not an expert on notes but I can probably dig you out some official stuff from the Open University if you want it, which would include various techniques (there are other methods, using different types of charts, spidergrams, mnemonic thinking etc).

Particularly when you're summarising: make sure to use your own words. Be reasonable with that though (i.e. some answers look for specific key words so don't delete them) but in your own words you'll take the understanding, rather than just learning rote phrases. 

Posters and mind maps, colour coding - good things to stick around your room. There are some topics you have to just learn (like a step by step route to something in science) so sticking that in your bathroom while you're brushing your teeth or something might help. 

Best way to check your understanding something is try explain it to someone. Siblings, friends or parents are good - and if they don't know anything about the topic they'll probably ask you low level questions which will really check your underlying reasoning. Alternatively, if you're not sure about doing that completely then speak to a teddy bear or something (sounds nuts, but same deal). Saying things out loud can help you process it. Read a page in the book, explain it. Do it again later without having read the book, or maybe after a 10 second glance.

I had to memorise a load of crystal structures last year which was quite frankly horrendous. I made up a story instead. I could remember a story because you're creating an association ""x does something to y"" which is easier to remember than blank statements. Personify things if you need to, I think that's how I learn. I think about happy and angry molecules all the time :D

Flash cards might help - because they're so small there's a limit to what you can write. If you can relate things to each other then it gives you a path to ""work it out"" when you're in the exam. Then there's mneomics and so on...

Make sure to try do past papers with this. There's usually lots of recurring parts or themes in exams, so give it a go without the book but if you need it then it's not a bad idea to go through the process of writing what is a correct answer.

Also, our ticket prices have been increasing year on year since the takeover.

My season ticket was £715 last season. It will rise again this year. It's not unusual for the 'cheapest' individual ticket prices at the Etihad to be above £50 now.

The club can only get away with that due to an increase in demand for tickets, from people who didn't attend when we were shit.

The club wouldn't charge such prices, and continue to raise them, if they couldn't sell the tickets. Even with all the success.

A lot of people are being priced out, and can't afford to go regularly anymore, but that doesn't matter to the club if someone else is prepared to pay that price, and the stadium is full.

Why did Bertrand ""NEED"" to go on loan? He is most likely gone after this season.

Kalas wanted to go on loan. But Mourinho did not want him to because of the lack of squad depth. Hence why I said Bertrand should have stayed and put Kalas on loan.

Mourinho worked Varane in between Pepe and Ramos. Even a 34 year old Carvalho played. 

For the most part it has been Terry-Cahill and a little bit of Luiz. The backline is aging and their replacements are young and inexperienced. Thus why Mourinho needs to do a better job at working them in, like he did with Varane.

When you look at it though Propylene glycol ( the main ingredient in e-juice ) is used throughout food production and in supplements already, we know that it's nearly impossible to reach toxic levels using it this way, it's completely safe in that respect.  They've even used it to [sterilise air from pneumococci, streptococci and other bacteria.](http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/health-safety-e-smoking/1734-germ-killing-vapor.html) so - low and behold - it *may* even be good for you.  

Anything has to be better then filling your lungs with tar, carcinogens and carbon monoxide. The other benefits of e-cigs go without saying really. 


2016 will be the year that makes or breaks this cottage industry though, that's when the government wants to medically regulate e-cigs and vapes. 

What we could end up with however may be a product of pharmaceutical ( or gawd forbid tobacco industry ) company lobbying i.e. probably useless like nicotine inhallors are now, and that would be a crying shame for those who want to stop smoking using this method. 

I agree though, they should independently test it properly so we can finally put this to bed once and for all. No funding from anyone who may have a conflict of interest in the results either. 

Until then however I'm sticking firmly to my vape.

This all being said, Mourinho and Chelsea don't always play this way, they just do it when there is a big occasion against a top side. For me, it shows his lack of tactical nuance rather than the opposite. He doesn't really retain his playing style and make tweaks to fit the opposition, he shuts down completely and waits for the opponent to make a mistake.

No it doesn't.  A dot doesn't indicate quality of chances.  Based on that argument the Ba goal wasn't a quality chance compared to others.  Apart from the end Chelsea had 2 good chances, a breakaway and a header off the corner.  Both were some of the only instances they even got forward enough to attack.

Yes, I have dug deeper into the game than you comparing shot location and making assumptions.  I am not saying Chelsea played poorly or didn't deserve to win.  They did exactly what they wanted to do.  Limit space in the final third and hope to score on a mistake against the run of play.  It's the same thing people do to Barca.  Liverpool dominated the game but made the critical errors that Chelsea had hoped for.  I don't see how that is even arguable.

Chelsea didn't look to dominate the game, they looked to do the exact opposite.  I'm not even saying dominating means you deserve to win, it doesn't.  It's just a way of describing the play and while Liverpool did dominate the play Chelsea had solid defense to limit as many chances as possible and capitalized on an error.

true,Melberger,null,null,"Besides the point though isn't it mate, you've obviously been a football fan longer than you've been at a City fan. There must have been a club you supported previously but ditched in favour of City.

If you're just a floating football fan, who likes watching top sides play, and watches many different clubs, and feels an affinity to different clubs for different reasons, then fair enough, I can understand that more.

But please don't try and adopt some kind of 'true blue' stance equating yourself with long standing City fans, it's fake, and insincere IMO. As harsh as that may sound.

You'd be surprised re the camera comment, I've seen some ridiculous lenses at the football.

I don't agree re the photo comment, people can find pictures of City players, or any other players on the internet. If they want to simply see the players all they have to do is put on the television. I think the photo thing is more from a personal perspective, of wanting to capture your experience for your benefit, the novelty of it. Like going to a zoo.

That's the disconnect, because for us, it's not a novelty, it's a culture, it's part of our life. And will be, even if we were relegated to the 3 tier (again), could you say the same about yourself?

I have enough loyalty points to get tickets for every single game, but I have one or two mates who often struggle, even though they're been going to games for more than 15 years.

It can be frustrating knowing that they miss out, and I can't attend a game with them, but someone who is a new fan got a ticket ahead of them.

Again, I'd just like to reiterate. You have to understand the position and experience I speak from.

When I was a kid City were shit, my first game was when we were in the 3rd tier. All we had to shout about was our support and loyalty, it's a huge part of our identity. During that period. United were the top side in England, and even Europe. Even then their 'plastics' still took great pleasure in ridiculing us and mocking us. That is where that resentment and disgust for the glory hunter comes from.

We don't want those kind of people sat next to us at the ground, because we know they're only here for one thing. They're the very people who used to mock us when we were shit.

If we were still shit they wouldn't touch us with a barge pole.

He has stated before he doesn't feel like he is ready to coach a club like Barca. He feels like it isn't a challenge, and he doesn't think he can teach players like Messi and Xavi anything. He likes to improve players, and he likes to work with young players. So in that aspect, spurs might be the right club.

However, Ajax is his boyhood club, and he still sees it as a challenge to get his 5th(!) title with them, and make a good european run. 5 titles in a row has never been done before by any club in the Eredivisie.

Seriously though, I've gone through undergrad and postgrad (am now in my late 20s, have a PhD and work in an Engineering Dept.. so not unlike yourself) and there were a lot of people I would hang out with a lot - go for drinks with, play sport, but once the courses ended I've lost touch with all but a few. Even some I've lived with I barely hear from at all, not that we fell out or anything. I think it's just natural really, once the thing that links you is gone, then you tend not to hang out anymore.

I'm of typical English descent and I wouldn't discount hanging out with you if you asked just because you're a Sikh - if you asked I'd almost definitely say yes if you invited me to something I'd enjoy.. or just go for a pint. I would say that, as someone who still lives not far from where I grew up (I moved away for uni and came back later), I just have a decent amount of friends. It's quite rare I make new ones because I simply don't have the time to get to know people like I used to - life/job/family/etc get in the way. In some ways, you just have to persist a bit but without coming across as pushy/desperate - it's a fine line I guess!

In all seriousness, I think Farage is hugely flawed, and also completely misunderstood. 

I would say that at heart he is a free market libertarian and that is the be all and end all, but as UKIP grew in stature, the murky world of politics accelerated his failings.

By this I mean issues like immigration have been become as much a signature of UKIP as its position as the only British scrutinisers of the EU's failings.

With UKIP, the clue is in the name. It was a one party issue who failed to get a foot hold in domestic UK politics because it was a one issue party, and people weren't informed enough to care.

So what did UKIP do? They attempted to expand their base, but approached it without any real discipline. This is why you now have the disfunction tapestry of free market libertarians, looney disillusioned Tories, and more hardcore racist Labour leavers like the BNP and the EDL.

The bottom line is that Farage and UKIP's leadership f'd up. UKIP got this spotlight because of his brilliant taskmastering in the European Parliament, and being one of the very few willing to speak out. Now the whole debate around them is framed over immigration and racism, two issues that UKIP never had any background in.

TLDR: UKIP was a one policy party. Needed to expand but did without discipline. Became magnet for wierdos and racists, and now the pro Brussels media are able to hammer them and associate anti EU views with extreme racism.

I thought his performance against Hull where he had to fill in at CB was amazing and he has been solid in most of the other games he's played.

That being said, I still don't really know why we bought him. I don't really see him as a player suited to the premier league. His passing is very accurate and he can really fizz a pass, which is always good to see but he needs a lot of time and space in order to do it. If you put him under too much pressure, he can't sort his feet out quickly enough and might have to pass it backwards, where as Fernandinho or Toure have a turn of pace and quick feet to get out of those situations.

Off the ball he sometimes struggles in a fast paced match and can easily be thrown off by a bit of pace and skill. I've always thought Spain or Italy would more suit his playing style. I've liked him since he gave an interview in English, which showed he has really tried to settle in so I really want to see him do well.

I never received the first one, the second one said that I owed the full amount because I didn't pay the first one ...

I ignored it. They sent some letters threatening court and that the penalty had escalated.

Eventually the letters stopped.

From what I read, they can charge you for loss of income but they can't make up arbitrary penalties.

e.g. if you paid £1 for 1hr of parking and you stayed for 2hrs, you owe them £1. 

If the parking spot is free for 1hr and you stay for 2hrs, you owe them the hourly rate of £0/hr.

I am not a lawyer, so take this with a grain of salt.

I don't know if *all* of them actually believe in it or if they're just cultural Catholics. I think it's more cultural than anything else, especially these days. My cousin recently posted a status on Facebook saying ""Getting pished on Easter Sunday... gotta love being Catholic"" (or something to that effect). Says it all, really!

Back when my grandparents were still alive I had my ass hauled to mass twice a week without fail. They only lived around the corner so we all just went together. I guess it just proves the point that the older generations will *generally* be more religious than the younger ones. Once my grandparents passed away we stopped attending mass not long after. I still went to a Catholic school so if I went to mass it was because of the school. My mum identifies as a Catholic but she dislikes the Vatican and indeed, organised religion in general. She's just happy with her own belief in god and all that.

I think that Britain being culturally Christian is probably true, but it definitely depends on where you live or what sort of family you come from. I mean, even just going through any town you will find churches *everywhere*. Baptist, Methodist, CoE, Catholic, Latter Day Saints, Quakers... it doesn't matter. They all stem from the same religion. Schools still have religious elements - most primary schools around here will be named after some saint and say they're a Church of England school. If there was a Muslim school opening up people would *freak*, but if it's Christian nobody cares. We're not afraid of Christianity. It *is* a part of our culture even if we're not remotely religious.

I dunno where I'm going with this post. Just writing my own experience I suppose. Maybe many of our morals are adopted from the Bible, but to be honest the 10 Commandments are pretty straightforward.

I think you'll find nowadays that's achieved through hundreds of billions in bailout funds, quantitative easing, the suspension of normal accounting rules and a zero interest rate policy. 

Which is the elephant in the room. If banks weren't implicitly backed by government guarantees (and I'm talking internationally here) their catastrophically bad risk management would have sunk them in 2007.  Then what do you think would have happened to house prices? We are in a cheap money fueled bubble. Which it's why the London property market is just nuts, because it's where the funny money spigots are gushing the hardest. 


I know this isn't particularly helpful, but let's call a spade a spade. Forget all your supply and demand arguments, house prices have risen over the last 40 years because we've lived through an era of unprecedented credit expansion. Now, perhaps this can go on linearly for the next 40 years, but I doubt it. If you believe the stats the area of London where I live (and own a house for full disclosure) has risen 50% in the last 2 years. Does this make me feel happy?

Would it have been worth trying to go for 1 point to win us the title? I think going into the match, the right call was to attack. Try to push for early goals. As we have done, and as we did.

Having said that look at the positions when Gerrard slipped. Our two centre backs were within 8 yards of the half way line, both out wide, looking to push up. Gerrard was our deepest outfield player, and he was well inside the centre circle. If our two centre back hadn't been so wide and pushed up, it's possible one of them could have intercepted Ba...

Even if we knew what was going to happen would it have been wise to sacrifice the style Brendan has been getting us to play for the last 2 years for 1 point? I'm not sure. But, of course, we didn't know. It did cross my mind, before the match, should be sit back play more cautiously? I decided no, our best chance of a result was to score. It just didn't work out, although we did play well in the 1st half. As others have said Gerrard tried to make up for things, and it affected the team's shape.  

I also have to say that Chelsea look very well drilled and organised at the back. 

Finally, anyone who says only poor teams park the bus should have watched Real Madrid Vs Bayern Munich last week. In the first half Bayern had something like 73% possession, but they were also a goal down.

Those who have read into the party enough to know what they stand for and what their policies are, and are able to discuss them with some intelligence. Then you get the lower end, the people who go by hearsay, rumors and very little in the way of facts to find a party to support. Like people who vote for Labour just because 'the tories are high class cunts', or people who vote for the Greens because 'I like the environment'. You can see it in the US when tv stations go to a [Democratic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm1KOBMg1Y8) or [Republican](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY0M7IdNl7U) convention to interview supporters on party issues.

They may have heard that high levels of immigration is bad for the country, and assume it is referring to the stereotypical 'immigrant', so were caught out by seeing you, who I am guessing is from an Anglo-spheric country. I don't think they would be able to go into the hard line economics of why high levels of immigration is bad for the country, but I also don't think most of them are actually anti-immigrant, just anti-immigration. There are racists in UKIP who are anti-immigrant, that is certain. There is no way to keep them all out, but UKIP do try (they ban ex BNP and EDL members from joining) and they are still a minority in the party. As UKIP is suddenly getting a huge influx of support there is going to be a higher than average level of those uninformed people supporting them. As I don't know anything about the supporter(s) you met I can't assume they weren't racist, but they do seem like the fit in with just being uninformed. 

I was going to give you some advice on how UKIP border policies would affect your son and mothers situation, but I really don't know anything about your situation and would end up looking like an ass, especially as UKIP's 2015 manifesto isn't even published yet and the previous one is a write off. You shouldn't worry though. There is no chance UKIP will get anything more than a few seats in the commons in the next GE, and even that is questionable due to FPTP. So their policies on immigration will not go into effect anyway.

The key reason for voting for them, is as a protest to Lab/Con stemming from them failing to listen to a large chunk of the population opinion about the EU. The more votes taken away, the more the two main parties have to appeal to the lost voters. In all honesty, if Labour or the Tories set in stone an EU referendum in the next year, UKIP would die almost immediately. If the public decided to stay in, then UKIP knows the country has democratically voted and there is nothing else to be done. If we are voted out, that is a different matter.

I've been reading up a bit lately on some left wing views of the EU. Some want the UK to leave immediately, as they think the EU only represents the capitalist classes and isn't good for the worker. Others think that they should work towards changing the EU to represent the workers better. It seems everyone has a different opinion on it, yet all we see in the news is arguments to support UKIP, or arguments to support Labour/Lib Dems/Tories.

What I would like to see is the more left wing papers, like the Guardian or the Mirror, taking to actually make arguments. All they do is attack UKIP (whether justified or not), without actually trying to make suggestions on what other options there are relating to the EU.

&gt; What de Boer has done at Ajax is widely regarded as a big fucking accomplishment. Keep in mind that the guy is a coach for 3.5 years, has lost Suarez, Vertonghen, Stekelenburg, Eriksen, Alderweireld, and more in that time, and still won the league 4 times in a row.

de Boer didn't lose Suarez, that was the manager before him. He was appointed caretaker after Suarez had already left for Liverpool, so no..

As for the 4 times in a row, its nice and all but given Ajax's supremacy in the Eredivisie since forever, you really think its a big deal? After the 4th consecutive you think yet another one will be that much more special?

It's when the vile baseless insults are thrown around, 'Xenophobic, Racist, Nazi, Fruitcake', that it all goes to shambles. All it does is turn people off from listening to you, and well thought out critiques like this go ignored. It's especially affluent in the UK subs - Yesterday I was told to 'Fuck off back to stormfront' after suggesting that linking a poll that showed UKIP winning was not 'biggotry'. Same goes for the other side, saying 'Leftie scum', 'commie bastards' and such (although it is not as common here).

A lot of people seem to think that people on the other side of political spectrum are evil and purposely trying to destroy the country. It's not the case.

The fact is that negativity can win games but it doesn't win hearts, especially not when combined with the cynicism displayed by Chelsea on Sunday. And let's be clear: they've won just one CL trophy using that kind of defensive approach, with players that cost a squillion quid...and it was the most forgettable drudge of a final, that no-one outside of Stamford Bridge remembers fondly. It's hardly a legacy to be proud of.

How a team defends can have artistry to it, just like an attacking approach has its beauty, even if it's down to sheer dogged effort. (And, to be fair, Chelsea's CL win was admirable for the effort and concentration of that group of players.) Chelsea's performance yesterday demonstrated excellent defensive formation and discipline, and I think it's churlish to deny that fact.

true,UneasyElk,,Bristol Rovers,"Signings overall were so so despite that **Steve Mildenhall** and **John-Joe O'Toole** were two of better players this season. I would also rate **Kaid Mohamed** as a successful signing and **Chris Beardsley** has been decent. **Steven Gillespie** hasn't shown much yet. **Alan Gow** got injured for the remainder of the season soon after arriving but he looks good, not sure if we will sign him for next season though. I really rated **Will Packwood** while we had him on loan, he has since returned to Birmingham and featured a bit for them in The Championship. Thought **Alex Henshall** didn't get much of a shot but he can't have been great considering our poor options on the wing, since went back to Man City, I believe he was last on trial with Ipswich. Perhaps he was just a bad fit for us. **Andy Bond** utter shite, went back to Colchester and has since been released, plays for Chester now.

Our season has been poor. Second half of last season we were one of the most inform sides in the league. This season was supposed to be replicating that throughout the entire season but it seems **John Ward** really fucked it up.

Season started slow but we seemed to be picking up some good results at home. Our away form was dismal though and still is, winning just 2 away all season. From the get go it seemed obvious we missed a out and out goalscoring striker, we never managed to get one. **O'Toole** is our top scorer with 13 in the league, joint fourth in the division and he's a central midfielder.

It wasn't looking great come the midway point but nothing like relegation if we could get our away form together. Still churning out results at home but losing the majority of away games. Still lacking a goalscoring striker.

End of the season went horribly. Losing important games all over the place and nose diving fast towards the relegation zone. **John Ward** got himself out of there fast and somehow ended up as DoF (I would have got rid personally) and his assistant **Darrell Clarke** took over, his only managerial experience was at Salisbury City taking them to promotion last season to The Conference. Had more poor results despite a win over Morecombe on his debut as gaffer.

On Saturday we found ourselves at points in the relegation zone but we dug deep and beat relegation rivals Wycombe to put us 3 points clear with one game left.

&gt;so no. you haven't watched him. anybody who has been watching much EPL this year will know that Bony is currently a better striker than Lukaku.

And here is where your ignorance comes into display.

1.

[Romelu Lukaku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romelu_Lukaku) 13 goals in 28 games.

[Wilfried Bony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfried_Bony) 16 goals in 32 games.

Extremely similar stats, and you're trying to play it off like Lukaku isn't even on his level, which is an insult. At least have a clue what you're talking about before you start spewing shit around.

2.

Romelu Lukaku- 20 years old

Wilfried Bony- 25 years old

This isn't even a fucking question to me. I will take a player who is equal, if not better at the age of 20 and mold him into the player we need, rather than take on an equal, if not worse 25 year old who doesn't seem to have much growth from where he is now.

This entire thread is a fucking joke. You guys just like to start shit and have NO idea what you're talking about.

&gt;

&gt;Lampard attended [Brentwood School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentwood_School_(England\)) between 1989 and 1994, finishing with eleven [GCSEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education), including an A* in [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin). 

&gt;His father is [Frank Lampard senior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard,_Sr.), the former [West Ham United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.) player and assistant manager who was still associated with the club when Lampard junior was playing for them. His mother Pat died in April 2008 aged 58 as a result of [pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia).  Lampard's uncle is [Harry Redknapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Redknapp) and his cousin is Redknapp's son [Jamie Redknapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Redknapp).

&gt;In 2000, Lampard, Rio Ferdinand and [Kieron Dyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieron_Dyer) appeared on a sex video that was filmed at the holiday resort of [Ayia Napa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayia_Napa) in Cyprus. Channel 4 aired a brief clip as part of their 2004 documentary *Sex, Footballers and Videotape*, claiming it was used to ""remind the viewer that this is based on real life.""  On 23 September 2001, Lampard, along with three other Chelsea players was fined two weeks wages by the club for his behaviour whilst on a drinking binge on 12 September. Lampard and the others had abused American tourists at a Heathrow hotel, just 24 hours after the [11 September attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11_September_attacks). A hotel manager stated ""they were utterly disgusting. They just didn't seem to care about what had happened"".

Taking friendship beyond social activities? It's hard. It's really hard - and it only gets harder as you get older.

But it's massively possible - and you should try, because it's important.

Since you're highly educated (compared to some), perhaps consider reading up on this area. It's not as crazy as it might sound - psychology and social situations (as much as they're really hard to understand) are pretty well documented, and with some thought and effort, you can massively improve various bits of social skills (it may be hard to introspect and work out what to improve, but perhaps just say ""everything"" and keep working at it?) 

It's not really exactly what you want, but I do [recommend reading this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tribal-Leadership-Leveraging-Thriving-Organization/dp/0061251321) because whilst it may sound irrelevant (and lame?) it's really awesome at helping you understand things like this.

I think I'd suggest that your perception of the problem as 'integration' with the racially English people as just... well, a perception. 

My suggestion might be to get involved in some new activities - set yourself some challenges - to do things you've never done before - perhaps try 8 new things in a month? Different activities (ever joined a caving club, taken a cookery class, or learnt to dance salsa, been to yoga?) of course - you probably know this bit really well.

Next try and work out how you can improve the lives of those 'activity partners' - how you can make them happier. Can you offer to teach their children a skill (teach them to code/soldier/codeclub?)? Can you introduce them to some other people they might share interests with? Can you introduce them to another activity that is also fun?

Actually, I said that book might not be relevant - it definitely is. Go read it. :)

I think Milner provides a much better foil for David, David always has his head up for a runner, Nasri never makes runs off the ball, he always comes short to receive it. Milner will always give and go, and gets in dangerous positions.

When David doesn't play no-one picks out Milner's runs, when he does play Milner makes them even more than usual, and David always finds him.

It's precisely this link up which got us back into the game at Anfield from two goals down. It's this link up which was key to us smashing the scum 6-1.

When they play together, it works. Especially when Aguero plays.

If David is fit to start he has to come in for Nasri if we continue with two up front, for me.

Goes without saying that Spanish Dave is the heartbeat of the team, and twice the player Nasri is. Nasri is more often than not a passenger who flatters to deceive, David takes the game by the scruff of the neck and leads.

About that Chelsea game, if Gerrard doesn't colossally fuck up right before halftime the game stays 0-0. Let's be honest, Chelsea never looked like scoring before then. Talk tactics as much as you want but they got very, very lucky to pick up the win. They deserved a draw easily due to having the best and most organized defense in the world at the moment. Mourinho played to his team's strengths and got the result. That's not to mention their 'weakened' side cost over 20 million more pounds than the one Liverpool fielded. That to me shows how far the team has come. Mourinho concedes to park the bus with 10 behind the ball, which is something he's usually reserved as a tactic against the best teams in Europe.

That's not true. As you can read [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_de_Boer#Managerial_career) de Boer took over as a caretaker before the winterbreak. As you can read [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su%C3%A1rez#Ajax), suarez left at the end of the winterbreak, 28th of june. So the team he took over just lost their most important player. 

And i don't say he doesn't want to coach Tottenham. I'm saying he isn't really looking to leave, but he still might.

I think the history of the clubs and what you can do with the team is my cup of tea.""

&gt;___Awake___ is an American television [police procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_procedural) fantasy drama that originally aired on [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC) for one season from March 1 to May 24, 2012. The [pilot episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(Awake\)) had an early release on [Hulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu) on February 16, 2012, two weeks before the series' premiere on television. The show's central character is [Michael Britten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Britten) ([Jason Isaacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Isaacs)), a detective who works for the [Los Angeles Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department). [Kyle Killen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Killen), the series' creator, was primarily responsible for the program's concept; although he served as a writer, he avowed that writing episode scripts was difficult. Killen also served as an executive producer (with [David Slade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Slade)) of the pilot episode. [Jeffrey Reiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Reiner) and [Howard Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Gordon) then continued producing (with Killen) for Gordon's Teakwood Lane Productions.

Given Liverpool's recent form and scoring prowess this season, can you really blame them? I personally took it as a compliment.

Though what Gary Neville and Carra pointed to in the video in the other thread is definitely true. Liverpool lost their discipline in the second half. Snatching at long shots, and not feeding it into Suarez. Suarez disappeared because he wasn't given a chance to use the ball at all. For the first time in a while Liverpool looked dire in creativity. Rodgers needs to pick the team up and teach them more ways to break the bus.

What happened with the Aspas short corner? Why were Allen, Gerrard and Coutinho jumping the gun and firing from long range? How come when faced against one of the best defenses in the league we decided to throw away our tactical ability to keep a calm head and take our time to make every possession count? If Rodgers is serious about winning the title this year or the years after, he'll need to find answers to these questions and get the team together on the same page.

We've got Paulinho, Dembele, Holtby, and Siggy's not too bad in the position when he's subbed on. I'd have Siggy go, because Paulinho at the Confederations Cup was an absolute monster. He's capable of being solid, but something's not clicking-maybe it's coming off injury, the club morale sinking during and after AVB this season, or most realistically, playing carefully so not to get injured right before the World Cup. After all, Cunt Adam has already broken his ankle. 

I'd mind him going, particularly because he's a good utility player. Where Dembele can dribble very well, but doesn't have a killer pass, Paul is a force in the air who can put in passes when it matters.

So I purchased some better juice, but I can't fill the tank because it comes with a dripper the size of my finger, so I purchase a needle bottle after poisoning myself a few times, and now I need to figure our Ohms law to replace the coil. And I don't recall having to find a youtube video to teach me how to smoke properly. I'm sure that once I have the bits I need and some more practice it will be fine, but it's almost enough to make me just quit. 

Secondly the industry needs some serious quality control. I've used 3 different retailers, and each time something needed to be replaced. And I guess this is normal, since each time the retails have just said ""replacement is in the mail"", you don't even get that with Dell's top-tier enterprise prosupport. 

Lastly, the whole e-liquid market needs regulation. The first lot of stuff I ordered came from China, and god only knows what's in it. So I ordered some some stuff from Atmos Lab - made in the EU, some quality control done at a university, looks good right? Stuff came in a glass vial with a hand-printed label.

Not to be condescending, but if you answered no to either, then you're unlikely to understand why you'd be inclined to see City lose in a meaningless game to prevent United winning the title.

It is a meaningless game, they can't finish forth and all Everton need is a point before the season's end to guarantee Europa League football. And even if they don't get that point, it would take United to win every single remaining game and likewise a strong run from Spurs to upsurp them.

Everton's players are a different matter altogether, they are professional footballers, not Everton fans, they'll want to win.

I do however think that the lack of bite and enthusiasm from the Goodison crowd will work heavily in our favour. That hostile reception is what has given Everton that extra percent to beat us in the past.

No chance will Everton fans be actively supporting us, but they won't be majorly up for the game and making it difficult for us. It will be a strange atmosphere.

true,herplederple540,null,null,"OK honest response from a fairly typical upper middle class brit in their mid twenties:

* Unfortunately, STEM fields often have many unsociable people. I find this in the CompSci world a lot. This can be due to mild autism/aspergers or just other factors culminating from locking oneself away studying hard things for extended periods of time. 
* Socializing in the UK (England really) is mostly about banter/chat/repartee (whatever you call it). If you're witty enough and fun enough to be around, you can get away with anything. This is very, very different from other parts of the world like the USA, parts of Asia, Western Europe.
* Do you have a thick accent? Is the accent off-putting? Indian accents can be quite grating sometimes.
* Do you have a large beard?
* Do you eat lots of pungent indian food with tumeric? Often non-desi can be off-put by the smell of indian food. Sorry if you find this offensive, but hopefully you see what I'm talking about. 
* Are you good looking? Overweight, very short, very tall or anything? People can be very shallow sometimes. 
* Turbans can be a bit weird. Many people who aren't terribly worldly will find your Turban a bit strange - Can they ask questions about it? Why are you wearing it? Isn't it just massively inconvenient? Turbans are on a vaguely similar par to Hassidic Jews' hats and beards. Maybe make light of it, be slightly self-depreciating to remove any tension. 
* Socializing is hard anyway. Hold a house party, invite people along to do something, organize trips and things. Often people do want to socialize but are always relying on ""someone"" in the group to arrange things first.
* Brits are also very reserved as people. Most won't socialize outside of their class, especially with a higher class and often people's friends are localized entirely with the group that they attended secondary school/uni with for their entire life.

A big part of that is being born and raised in Manchester, the rivalry is deep.

I did hear the fans at Selhurst Park, I was there mate. I'll be there on Saturday with a good mate also.

I think you misunderstand the nature of home and away support, as away fans we can be vocal, but if the home fans are at it then we can't compete due to numbers, we'll just be drowned out. And if they're hostile as they can be at Goodison, that makes it all the more difficult for the players.

But, for the first time, I don't believe that hostility will be there. It will be a strange atmosphere.

And we'll (the travelling support) be as vocal as is possible, so if all things go well, and the Everton fans are muted, it should be more like a home game/neutral venue. Which will benefit the players greatly.

That burden of a hostile crowd has hindered our players before, especially at Goodison.

Saturday is a huge opportunity, and it won't be an ordinary game at Goodison, they're indifferent, half of them are actively hoping we win.

Everything is leaning in our favour.

It would just be typical if we blew now though wouldn't it?!

I would genuinely die a bit inside if that happens. It's all in our hands.

EDIT: Re Everton and Europa League, nope. They only need a point to guarantee Europa League football, with a point that would guarantee the lowest they can finish is 6th, United won't be able to finish above them if they get a point, whatever happens.

Yes, GCSE exams are pretty much just information recall. However, it is so much easier to recall something if you understand it.
Which is easier?

Recall the following sequence: 3.14, 1.57, 1.43, 1.32, 1.31, 1.36, 1.43, 1.52, 1.62, 1.73
Recall the following sequence: x = (n/7) + (3/n) for n = 1...10

I did 3 science GCSEs and A levels, and I didn't memorise a single formula. I would make sure I understood concepts well enough to be able to derive formulas when I needed them. Imagine you tell someone else a formula/fact/anything, but they don't believe you. If you can't convince them, then you don't understand it well enough.

With physics, it's particularly easy. Here's a simple example.

A car travels 210 metres in 6 seconds. What is its average speed?

A lot of people would recall ""Speed = Distance / Time"" and get 35m/s. A few would get the answer wrong by misremembering the formula as ""Speed = Time / Distance"". After blindly following the formula, they would write down 0.0286 m/s.

This is what I would think: ""Speed is the change is position over time and is expressed as metres per second. That means the formula will be metres / seconds. 210/6 = 35. 35m/s means I'm travelling 35 metres every second. So in 6 seconds, I'd travel 6 * 35 = 210 metres"".",0,1398734457,null,0,false,0,ch4ng1c,t3_247d9x,t1_ch4ng1c,t1_ch4h5dj,null,1433566097,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

true,timxmoby,logo,,"Mangala: I'm a fan of Mangala. I think some of his defensive work is at times shoddy, but he has all the physical requirements for the Premier League (pace, strength, jumping etc). I also think some of his bad defensive displays has to do with the tactics that Porto is displaying this year. Bad tactics can make a good player look bad. Kompany and Pellegrini will get him ready for the start of the season, and I think they will form a dynamic partnership. 

Fernando: Fernando is a classic CDM. He doesn't offer the most going forward but he is a great defender, and it would be interesting to see if we did a midfield of 3 next year with Yaya and Fernandinho pushed at the top of the three and Fernando sitting back. I'm not sure what this entails for Garcia, but I would love to be able to keep him, he has improved greatly this year. But with Fernando looking likely, and Zuculini already confirmed to be coming next year, it looks like he will be going. 

Sagna: And lastly Sagna will be a welcome addition. Zaba is getting run into the ground. He plays every game because there is no suitable backup. Sagna is a good defender and a decent attacker and he will do well to rotate with Zaba and push them both to work harder for the RB position. I'm sorry to see Micah go, but it is inevitable. He can not stay fit and theres no point of paying him for being injured.

Even when its treaties require ratification by referendum it has a woeful record of ignoring negative responses.

There used to be a strong current of leftwing Euroscepticism in the UK, peaking with Michael Foot's commitment to leave the EEC. Trade unions and grassroots Labour supporters once rightly disliked the removal of power from the people – a route, as they saw it, to introduce capitalist policies without consent.

That democratic tradition was abandoned after Jacques Delors' speech to the TUC in 1988. He didn't make a pitch that their fears for democracy were wrong – instead, he effectively argued that Brussels' undemocratic machinery could be used to implement leftwing ideas without voters' consent. It was a shameful bargain to strike, but it was struck nonetheless.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; when it comes to relationships and marriage it's a total mess. … I tend to pursue and try and form relationships with middle class British women (regardless of race). Generally my experience has been my outward experience tends to scare off women -- even if they are OK with me and find me an attractive and decent partner they worry about family.

My intuition says you're being fobbed off.

Dating's not always easy, especially in your 30's, so take this with a pinch of salt, but I feel like ""family and societal perception"" is a bit too much of an ""obvious answer"".

If I were in this situation, I'd be responding by saying ""pffft, I don't believe your family and friends are so shallow as to care that I wear a silly hat"". 

I don't say that to disrespect your religion or its trappings, just to illustrate how I efface myself.

I think maybe you're a bit serious, and I think you could maybe benefit from messing about a bit - that you could benefit from *learning* to mess about a bit.

Banter has become an overused word in recent years, but it describes a jocularity which is a part of British life, and the best kind is the humour is that which you make at your own expense.

If you make a joke about yourself then it doesn't hurt anyone else, or niggle at their self-doubts or make them wonder if maybe you really mean it (and the joke was a mask to hide an insult).

Taking the piss out of yourself shows that you're secure about yourself - which itself is an attractive quality - and it will make you popular by allowing others to laugh freely (without, for example, concern that they're joining in the bullying of a 3rd party).

So to return to where I began, if you're discussing why someone doesn't want a relationship with you, it's already too late. It's like discussing the best way to repair a broken vase - the best way is not to drop it in the first place!

If you were engaged in a successful relationship, your lady would be thinking for herself all the positive things about you to present to her friends and family - the negatives would barely merit consideration.

My intuition: when you're being told ""I don't know what my family would think"" is perceived as kinder than the more honest ""I just don't fancy you, Ron"" or ""you're just not my type"".

""I don't know what my family would think"" places the object of your affections in an *it's not you, it's me* role - it's no insult to you, and there's not much blame to be attributed. This answer avoids having to face you with hard truths, ""there's no chance, pal"".

I think your own words, which I've quoted above, betray you - you're looking too earnestly for marriage. Possibly, even, you're too serious and you come off desperate.

I think you're asking how to make your life happier, but I don't think marriage will do that. I think finding the right person may make your life happier, but you're putting the cart before the horse.

If I go for coffee with some lovely lass, what's marriage got to do with it? Most people of our age are not looking for a marriage commitment before they share a bed - I would say that most British people take a lover on the basis of attraction and a trust that they won't break your heart tomorrow or next week.

That's about it, on the commitment front - British people take their boyfriends or girlfriends home to meet their parents on the basis of ""we've been shagging some months, and if this continues so well for another year or two, I'd like to move in together"".

You can't change who you are, but I think if you made it your mission, for example, to go on OKcupid and get yourself one date a week, you'd soon find yourself with less invested in this question, and after a couple of dozen dates you'd be able to look at romance with a better perspective.

true,scouse_scum,null,null,"&gt;Here is what I appreciate about City: Sure they have had the money poured in, but at least you still play attractive as fuck football and don't have any cunts on your team and your manager is a professional.

You surely don't have any cunts on your team.  It isn't as if your best player is known for diving, biting, racism, timewasting, referee baiting, cheap tackles, and general cuntiness.

&gt;What stood out to me is how Pellegrini stood around after the loss at Anfield and waited to shake the manager and Stevie's hand after his celebration. This wasn't even brought up/noticed by many because in this world, being an attention whore tends to attract a lot more of the focus instead.

Yes, I'm a huge fan of fair play.  All I can say is that when a player is injured and his team kicks the ball out of touch, most teams actually follow the unwritten rules of fair play.  You can bitch and whine about Mou not waiting around until the 93rd minute when losing 2-0, but I'd say most fans prefer a manager who is truly bothered by a loss.

&gt;If not us then I'd rather have City for reasons stated above. Having said all of that, please drop points to Everton.

The end goal is money, profits, all of which are accumulated via the fans, the supporters, the sponsers etc. Winning is a means to an end. By winning you significantly increase the chance that you can attract more fans, get better plays which all help you win more, yes, but it all revolves around generating something to behold. Sports like this are a spectacle. If there were no viewership it wouldn't exist. I can guarantee that your own personal desire to be competitive in any way influences the performance of the team you support. 


In response to the statistic you cherry picked regarding sacked managers this year. Teams that fail to live up to their standards sack their manager, but why? Sure, if they are losing but in the grand scheme of things who gives a shit. When you fail to live up to your supporters exceptions they will turn on you. I promise that the clubs at the top, that have a larger fan base and global presence because who cares to watch some measly Sunday league team, even if they do win whatever they are playing in. It is all about money my friend, everything in life is. Why else do the players prefer to sit on the bench vs. be a starter at another club?


Maybe it is just that you are a glory hunter, I'm not sure, I don't know you. What I'm trying to stress is that there are more important things in life than winning. I would support my team regardless of whether we were winning or not. Take our last couple of years for example. I watch soccer because I enjoy it, if I didn't we wouldn't be having this argument. I am happy that we are winning but I wouldn't stop supporting the team if we were not top of the table.


Here's some googling I did. 

Sport: a physical activity (such as hunting, fishing, running, swimming, etc.) that is done for **enjoyment**

Sport: all forms of usually competitive physical activity which, through casual or organized participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing **entertainment** to participants, and in some cases, spectators.

Some people just don't care whether they don't get a job or lose their job because they know it means they can get back on benefits and get to play xbox at home all day. 

Then they irresponsibly have kids, maybe to upgrade their house or increase the amount of benefits they receive, but the kids have those parents as role models and the cycle continues...

I think a problem with our education system is that schools are kicking students out too early (at 16) for not getting good enough grades, while letting students who get good grades stay until their 18 (common sense would tell me it should be the other way round).

I think it should be mandatory for everyone to stay until they're 18 because I think, on the whole, 16 year olds are too immature, too inexperienced and are not well educated enough to be personally making decisions about their career-path or entering the workforce. 

The trouble is that from then on, they (16 year olds) don't really grow up either because they can't get or maintain a job with adult role models. Which leads back to my point about benefits.

&gt; There is a dilemma looming for Everton should they maintain the form that demolished Arsenal on Sunday and close in on Champions League qualification. What if they help Liverpool win the Premier League by beating Manchester City on the penultimate weekend of the season?
&gt; 
&gt; According to Sylvain Distin, some Evertonians at Goodison Park would rather concede a top four finish than assist in a 19th league championship for their Merseyside rivals.

&gt; Last Sunday, I was on the phone while watching the first 30 minutes of Liverpool’s close-run win over Norwich City. On the other end of the line was Jamie, one of my childhood mates, a fellow survivor of the Barcelona train-ride indignity and a lifelong Everton fan. I asked him how he viewed Liverpool’s pulsating romp towards the title. After thinking for a moment, he described his experience of watching Liverpool’s 2005 Champions League miracle in Istanbul, where they fought back from 3-0 down against AC Milan to win the game on penalties. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""The game was so irresistible and Liverpool’s human spirit so admirable, I found myself starting to cheer for them at around the 60-minute mark,"" he admitted sheepishly. ""By the time penalties came around, I was out of my seat rooting for the Reds as if my life depended on it,"" he said. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""But once they had won, the cameras cut to a close-up shot of the beaming smile on Steven Gerrard’s face as he lifted that Champions League trophy high above his head. The second I saw it, I felt sick in my mouth and regretful I had spent a moment supporting them,"" he said.
