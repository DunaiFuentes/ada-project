false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Whilst interesting, have no doubt these statements will be used to justify ""amendments"" to the Welfare State that will make the last four years of cuts look like positively kind by comparison. I don't even need to soil my browser history by heading over to the Daily Mail; I can all but guarantee a near the top of page article decrying the amount of money spend on ""Feckless"" welfare claimants.

These two things happen anyway though.  You can't reach some people.  The sort of person who reads the Daily Mail and gets outraged because they think it depicts reality won't be convinced or moved by this no matter what it says.

The first step *(and this is true whichever way things get pushed)* is to try to engage with moderates.  The kind of people who you can tell something and offer evidence that it's true and who will then include that in their subsequent thinking.

&gt;I'm going to further make a couple of assumptions: the State Pension won't be included within the Welfare budget, and that the benefits such as child benefit and child tax benefit will be included in the proportion attributed to the Welfare State.

I was presuming that the expenditure figures would use the **[percentages as they're currently published](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/year_spending_2015UKbn_14bc1n_0010203040#ukgs302)**.  In effect all it needs to do is multiply out the percentage figure by the amount of tax the individual paid.

So it'd say, Mr/Mrs. BooksBiscuitsTea, you paid £10,000 in Income Tax.  We spent that on:    
Pensions:  £870.14  *(149.7 / 1,720.4) x 10,000*    
Healthcare:  £773.08   *(133.0 / 1,720.4) x 10,000*    
Education:  £523.72  *(90.1 / 1,720.4) x 10,000*    
Unemployment:  £24.42 *(4.2 / 1,720.4) x 10,000*    
And so on...  Ideally, with the numbers separated out to at least the first sub-layer on the linked page.

They had all sorts of merchandise, and as I got older my Uncle managed to grab some copies of the show and I'd watch them with him and my father. I admit, at the time I was pretty apathetic towards it and didn't pay the greatest attention. I'd be doing school work or reading at the same time, sort of half watching while they watched. I'm British and I'm not sure about any other Brits here, but Doctor Who is such a normal part of life it seems. It's such a staple in conversation you hear from your parents and older family members when you're a kid, it's referenced a lot in our media and what not... so it wasn't some exciting special thing to me back then. It was just watching this show that everyones parents loved, it already felt too engrained in my brain too feel interesting at the time I suppose! Haha. Also, Doctor Who and the nature of the show wasn't really my 'thing' back then either.

Roll on many many years later, and I hear that there's a Vincent Van Gogh episode in the new Doctor Who. I **LOVE** Vincent Van Gogh, ever since I was little. I hadn't bothered to watch the new Doctor Who before then.. I can't really tell you why not, because I don't know why not. I think I was just into other stuff. Anyway, I decided to watch the Vincent episode.. balled like a fucking baby, fell in love with that episode. I decided I wanted to watch more, so I remember looking on the internet for good 'stand alone' episodes and settled on Blink. LOVED it. The weeping angels were (and are) absolutely terrifying and I was fascinated at how cool these enemies were. Annnddd there it was. I decided after watching ""Blink"" to go back and start with Nine and Rose, finding episodes on the internet.

I want to rewatch classic Who. I remember small parts from watching it with my father and uncle, but certainly not everything. Thankfully I know enough to understand enough of the classic Who references that pop up from time to time!

Currently begging my father to get all his old merchandise out of his attic, since he's not interested in it anymore and I obviously really am!

_Looks down at own body... nods_

So right about the console experience. It's not just the $400 for a new console, it's the $60-a-pop for the dozen new games you're going to have to buy, most of which are remakes - either of previous generation titles or of the same game from last year, all with _just enough_ changes to make it possible for the developer to release it with a straight face as a new game at full price. And then the downloadable content... can't forget that - the developers love that because you can't sell it to someone else when you're bored of the game.

XKCD has (of course) a strip about exactly this - http://xkcd.com/606/

The advantage of buying way behind the curve is that everything's a bargain. The flyers are full of ads for $2000 TVs but I know my next one will be wonderful and cost $400.

(my last two monitors are functionally equivalent (24"" IPS panel, rotating stand) - first one cost $700, last one was under $300)

I've pretty much given up on DVD even. Most of my content is streamed - either from Netflix or a local Plex server. So why do I need a 4K screen when my content's no more than 720p? There's a level of ""good enough"" and compromise, whether it's for price or convenience or something else. Case in point: we're all listening to MP3s... they're compressed audio... technically they don't sound as good as the CDs we were buying 20 years ago but we can carry 1000 albums in our back pocket and the quality is, for most purposes, good enough.

You're right about the $200 vs $20 knives. I like to think of it as we'd be OK spending a certain percentage of our disposable income on a specific item. You probably wouldn't stop to think about actual numbers but, if you're earning 10 times as much then you're probably OK spending 10 times as much on some knives.

It's funny... my parents used to be all about quality. They would be prepared to spend more than was necessary to get something that they thought would last. Unfortunately after living long enough that everything you've owned as been replaced 2-3 times, you learn that an expensive item doesn't necessarily last in proportion to its cost relative to a cheap item. If you spend 4x as much on something, maybe it'll last 2-3x as long, and you're living with something old &amp; tatty for a lot of that time.

So sometimes it's better to buy the cheaper stuff &amp; replace it frequently. But when you buy the cheapest crap, it's obviously cheap from day 1 and spoils the experience. There's a sweet spot in-between &amp; it varies by product.

Case in point: I bought a beautiful set of Prestige Lifetime pans 20 years ago. Not cheap but I figured they'd last forever (except Prestige promptly went bankrupt). Well, I still have the pans and they work but they're scruffy and discoloured and condemned to the bottom drawer for times when I run out of proper pans. Nowadays I buy a new set of mid-range pans on sale about every 4-5 years.  Just last week I bought a $500 set reduced to $150. I don't have to stress too much about scratching them because it's not something I expect to last a lifetime and I get to enjoy new shiny stuff relatively frequently.

The danger is when you buy the cheaper stuff with the expectation of replacing it more frequently and then, when it's got tatty &amp; banged-up, you think ""well it still kinda works"". You have to be ruthless and remember how you bought cheap X years ago so you could throw it out sooner.

I think it depends on the product area. Nobody's going to hold on to a laptop for 20 years, but a sofa might. Flat-screen TV will probably last you ten years - although I _almost_ treated myself to a $5000 DLP TV about ten years ago... saw someone trying to get rid of their old one, exact same model, on Craigslist recently for $100.

Sometimes it seems second nature and other times he still doesn't get it after being told. The Doctor is specifically bad at recognizing the Master because he loves and is good at disguises although the Doctor has recognized him on occasion.

* The First Doctor seemed to recognize the Monk somewhat easily but not the Master.

* The Second Doctor recognized the War Chief almost instantly.
* The Third Doctor had trouble with the Master but that was mostly due to the Master's disguises and actually the Third Doctor did recognize the Master in Tremas' body. He did not recognize Omega but then again he never met him (or had he?). It took him a while but he eventually recognized K'anpo Rimpoche who lampshades the Doctor's often poor ability to recognize other people.

* It took the Fourth Doctor, even after Drax said his name, a bit to recognize him. He also didn't recognize Romana II, but to be fair she did regenerate as Princess Astra so that threw him for a loop.

* The Fifth Doctor did not see through the Master's disguise in Time Flight if I remember correctly, but had his suspicions about the Master in The King's Demons despite the disguise because the Master 'could not disguise his intent'. The Doctor recognized Borusa after regeneration twice but that isn't too difficult with Borusa being Lord President and all.

* The Sixth Doctor recognized the Rani with a disdainful sneer. He also recognized an old tutor Azmael.

* The Seventh Doctor did not recognize the Rani but to be fair not only did she disguise herself but he was also still experiencing regenerative trauma at the time.

* The Eighth Doctor didn't have a difficult time knowing who the Master was seeing as the Master wasn't even trying to disguise himself but regardless he was experiencing some serious regenerative trauma at the time so any difficulty would come from that.

* The Tenth Doctor did not see through the Saxon disguise but he said it was because of the Archangel Network. The Jacobi Master was human at first so the Doctor didn't know him to be the Master until the fob watch was opened.

And the converse. Almost everybody seems to recognize the Doctor whenever and wherever (unless they don't know him personally): Borusa, the War Chief, the Master, the Monk, the Rani, K'anpo, etc.

What's a great way to stir up extremists in a minority community? Make them feel excluded and hated by the rest of the population, like the only way that they can make a statement is to fight back. 

Essentially, the more articles the media publishes that generates distrust in a minority community, the more extremists are likely to rise, leading to more events, which allows for more news to be generated that can be used to sell papers, and generate further distrust in the Muslim community.

This is made easier by the fact that most people, especially early generation immigrants, generally associate with people from their own culture; not out of a desire to purposely avoid integration, but simply because people have a tendency to stick to their comfort zones, especially in an unfamiliar environment where they may not speak the language natively. People from Western cultures do exactly the same thing: Just look at the masses of ex-pat Facebook groups and forums that exist for virtually every popular emigration destination worldwide, if you need examples.

The problem is compounded when the media generates distrust of that community; the rate of integration thanks to increased racial/religious tension on both sides.

Essentially, yes, extremists are certainly a thing, but the fact is that they are a tiny minority of the Muslim community.

Yep. If my TV died and go out and buy one that's pretty much the same as what I have - and almost every one on sale will be superior. Rightly or wrongly I'd avoid the ""no name brands"". I say rightly or wrongly as I'm sure the quality of some of the no name brand TVs are excellent, but at the same time the quality brands, be that LG, Samsung, Sony, whoever, tend to have better reliability, better remote controls, better trimming etc. And if it's going to be sat in your living room for 5 to 10 years you might as well get something you're happy with. 

With a smart phone, a low end model would be more than adequate. I was very happy with my Samsung Galaxy 2 and only upgraded when that died. If my current phone died I'd buy roughly the same specs but would stick with a quality brand.

I heard of Doctor Who through Sylvester McCoy reruns but never watched any episode fully, so ideas like the theme or TARDIS never rang in for me.  Also they played episodes out of order so one day you're getting McCoy and the next your getting Colin Baker which his intro scared me to death as a kid and turned me off to Who entirely growing up.

It wasn't until Tennant that I was intregued with the series and saw a rerun The End of Time Part II as my first episode.  While I didn't understand a thing that was going on and thought the proceedings looked rather silly it looked fun until the end in which I bawled my eyes out only to then scratch my head at Mr. Rocknrolla (Smith).  

I didn't start regularly watching until Clara (or was that Oswin or Clara Oswin) Oswald became the regular companion.  I liked the character after the first episodes she was in and honestly I was wondering what was Bucky's girlfriend doing on this show (much like asking why did Raymond Calitri (Eccleston) call himself The Doctor in a very awesome leather coat).  Before the 7B premiere I caught up on all of the new series, fell in love with it (although the Smith years were touch and go with cracks in the universe, recreating the Big Bang, companions dying then they're alive now they're all the way dead due to paradoxes.  It was too much wibbly wobbly.  Even with that I liked all involved).  Now with the current Doctor/companion I love the show even more.

So TL;DR: McCoy is technically my first but weird syndication schedule turned me off until Tennant except it was his last episode.  It wasn't until Clara that I became invested in the show full time even re-watching all NuWho from the beginning to present and I'm currently loving the current Doctor/companion combo.",0,1414996479,null,0,false,0,clrixo9,t3_2l3zn8,t1_clrixo9,t3_2l3zn8,null,1426217037,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

She had enough personhood to walk away, but that's really all. Beyond that her time was defined simply by whether or not she was crushing on the Doctor at this particular point.

Amy's life is certainly constantly and dramatically influenced by the Doctor since she met him so young, but I'd argue that an influential childhood experience is less undermining to her autonomy as a character than Rose going 20+ years as a bland nothing to be suddenly redefined by Prince Charming. 

Amy calls shots, sometimes with Doctor and most of the time with Rory. She never feels beholden to the men in her life or subject to their autonomy. Look, you guys can tell me if I'm missing something.

Say what you like and laugh it off if you will.

I think the strongest argument for ""Not Master"" is that it's River Song, who maybe figured out how to get out of the library -- or, when she was downloaded into the Matrix in the Nethersphere, she also regenerated after a fashion. And who but a Time Lord (Lady) could have taken the place over.

We also know that River was created to be a psychotic assassin who could actually kill the Doctor, so she may be continuing her mission.

On the other hand... remember what happened when John Simm's incarnation of the Master died the first time. Despite the Doctor pleading, he forced himself to not regenerate, so that the Doctor would be the last Gallifreyan.

There's also that little bit when Missy kills Dr. Chang, and he explodes into a red mist not unlike the humans killed by the Toclafanes when the Master brought them back to earth. 

Bringing the Master back as the cliffhanger before the final episode actually makes sense if the last episode sets up the possibility that Gallifrey can be recovered, but only if the Master and the Doctor work together. Knowing that it would be unlikely for the Doctor to do this willingly, the Master has engineered this entire thing in order to give the Doctor an impossible choice.

Remember Clara tossing the TARDIS keys into the lava? I think that motif is going to be important in a big way in the end of the next episode, with Missy/The Master essentially putting the Doctor in the position of playing that scene out again, except in real life, and not a dream.

The even bigger question, though, is what is the nethersphere, really? And have they actually uploaded the minds and taken the bodies of the dead, or is something else going on?

Finally, I'm assuming that everyone else has already realized that the nethersphere is inside of Missy's TARDIS, right? River never had a TARDIS, although technically, her mother was the TARDIS... The Master had a TARDIS with a fully functioning chameleon circuit, and one of his favorite disguises was as a column -- of which the building the Cybermen come out of has plenty.",0,1415000101,null,0,false,0,clrjted,t3_2l50ce,t1_clrjted,t3_2l50ce,null,1426216626,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

No doubt this is in support of more white-English-speaking immigrants. I think England is well past the days of taking pride in being white *or* English-speaking. Most British teenagers couldn't tell the difference between ""you're"" and ""your"" if their lives depended on it.

And do we really want *unskilled* Australian labour? Most unskilled Australians only ever came to London for one thing - cocaine. Cheap cocaine and cheap ecstasy (well compared to prices for that in Australia). And they become the ""ugly Australian"" on tour around Europe - not concerned at all with fitting in with the locals.

The worst part of inviting unskilled Australians into the United Kingdom is the reciprocal effect - unskilled British in Australia. That's something I don't want to see. And after enduring years of quite hateful racism especially in London I'm itching to make life hell for any Brit I find in Australia in the future.

As you could end up in a world of pain financially if the the surveyor asses the property value is below the amount the lender has agreed in principle to lend you which could see you having to find the extra funds if you are the winning bid on top of the other fees with buying a auction.

Trawl the local news paper archives or the council website, this will show the breakdown of the what the planning permission agreed to i.e. x amount private home, x amount housing association, x amount council, what the phase breakdown is for the estate you could find you are in a thousand home build and only seeing phase 2 of a 3,4,5 or 6 phase build, check local letting agency's site's to see how many properties are up for rent and broadband speed checks you will surprised how much this is becoming a factor in people purchasing choice. A good search to do is look at previous properties that have sold putting in a search of house number and street can bring up what it sold for against what it was advertised for. Facebook can be good as people like to complain about an area on there and can name and shame the problems.   

The council will not tell you anything extra that has not been published in the local news and its website.  Eviction by councils take time with problem cases and courts will not agree to tenants being made homeless, so if you do have the neighbour from hell it could take 3 months of to and fro by the council serving enforcement notices and finding alternative housing for them.  

Do your own searches looking at local newspapers, crime stats, Ofsted score, call your can insurance and get a quote for how much it will cost to insure your car if its an increase ask why they will tell you either due to the high value of the cars in the area or theft/damage taking place in that area. Look at how long building guarantees were for, the drop in price could indicate some parts of the guarantee have now expired i.e. central heating systems are normally 5-7 years depending on boiler maker. Also check annual service charges you are expecting to pay for living on a new build for thing like grass cutting and open space maintenance.

Yeah because it isn't like we've had more than a decade of expenses scandals, massive expansion of surveillance, heavy restriction or removal of specific civil liberties, total disregard for the opinion of the people with specific legislation or all-round general dickheadery over specific Government policies.

That's totally not been a thing. Nuh-uh. Nope.

I get that a recall bill needs to be balanced against abuse, the problem is that MPs have shown absolutely none of this due diligence when discussing matters of law that affect ordinary citizens more than them. 

It's all good and well saying that the ""wider number"" of MPs aren't assholes, but you're forgetting that every single one of those MPs has a vote in regards to legislation. So every shitty chunk of legislation that has come through has come through on the votes of those that you defend.

Then we have non-legislative activity. MPs have the power to protest Government actions, but have decidedly failed to do so over certain sickening aspects of this Government in particular. Even the opposition has been at best lax about its' attitude towards David Cameron and George Osbourne fighting an EU court case to protect Banker's bonuses, and I would like to point out that some of these ""unremarkable"" assholes continually oversee Government contracts being awarded to companies so blatantly incapable of performing their duties that some are under investigation by the SFO. Such companies include names like KPMG or Capita.

Shit, you know the assholes that massively undervalued the Royal Mail? The Government just re-hired those assholes to value the Probation Service.

So either we have a series of absolute incompetents next to all the genuine assholes and thus flawed or not the power of recall would be doing this country a huge favour.

Or we have a series of absolute assholes, some of which are simply so much louder than the others and thus make a majority look good.

I'm sorry, even if I accept that most MPs are good people or who want to lead effectively and do what's best whenever possible for a majority of the citizens of the UK and the UK itself, we see precious little proof of any of this.

They need to be seen to be that good and to have that intention. Perspective is paramount. If they make no effort to be seen to be trying to debunk the reputation of Parlimentarians then we can only assume they either have no interest in debunking the reputation or don't care about it.

It details what would happen to British people living in other EU countries in the absence of any special agreements, but the same reasoning can be brought to bear on EU citizens living in the UK. 

Legally, the Government would have to decide whether to grant visas to all of the EU migrants living in the UK. It would depend entirely on the will of the Government, which would like be the Tories if we ever leave, which would rather imply that most people would not be granted visas under whatever new criteria they dream up. 

In fact, because most EU countries will likely want to send a strong message by expelling the majority of British immigrants to their own countries, we would have a large portion of the 3 million Brits living abroad returning. Most of these people are professionals or retirees, and so would be looking for decent housing that simply doesn't exist. The only way to make housing available would be to remove most of the former EU immigrants. 

Basically it's very unsure, but it would undoubtedly be a clusterfuck of massive proportions. The EU is starting to show, quite reasonably, that it will have zero tolerance or goodwill with Britain if we leave, so bilateral negotiations are unlikely to create many reasonable continuations, meaning that we would likely expel the majority of EU citizens in order to make space for our own expelled citizens.

I'd favour Henderson above either Cou or Lallana.

false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,"Labour (if you are too, check out /r/LabourUK!)","Capital and goods tend to 'flow' to areas which already have capital and goods (i.e., wealthy areas) for a variety of reasons. If you had £100 to invest and I gave you a choice between two similar-sounding companies, one in Britain and one in Burkina Faso, you'd probably go for the British one, because you know Britain has political stability, a sound system of law, access to world markets, etc. Similarly with goods, if you can only afford to send shipments to one place, you send them to the place you're sure can afford to pay for them and where they won't be stolen or whatever.

Where goods and capital go, jobs are created. Britain can afford to have a massive 'service economy' because people are willing to invest in us and we have the incomes to pay for goods here, so people are willing to invest in us, etc., etc.

Obviously when capital and goods are free to go where they 'like' you do get some investment in poorer countries and they can afford to buy goods without punitive trade tariffs, so this is all to the good.

The problem is, if you free movement of capital and goods but then insist that everyone has to stay where they were born, people cannot follow capital to where the jobs are. You're condemning people, e.g., in Romania, to poverty based on nothing more than where they were born, while allowing the wealthiest Romanians to reap the benefits of being able to invest in stable economies in Western Europe and buy luxury goods. Thus you reinforce the unequal income distributions not just between but also within countries, based on arbitrary political or geographical borders. It's absurd and obscene.

Sometimes people object to this by saying something like 'Ah, but shouldn't people stay in Romania and work to make it better rather than leaving?' to which the reply is 'Isn't it fucking convenient for you that you get to hang around in Britain with its universal healthcare, relatively uncorrupt Government, good infrastructure et al., while Romanians have the noble task of building their country up from nothing?'

People also object that since Britons are now free to invest in Romania, that will eventually help Romanians out of poverty. The problem is that a) that doesn't really happen to any significant extent, for reasons mentioned above; and b) the 'Britons' most likely to invest in Romanian businesses are, in fact, Romanians living in Britain: If you think this argument is sensible, the logical extension of it is to allow Romanians to come and work here, earn a good wage and send some of the money home to their families to do whatever they like with it.",0,1415014190,null,0,false,0,clrm8al,t3_2l3d9a,t1_clrm8al,t1_clr7s5v,null,1426215498,7,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,7

From a psychological standpoint the human mind and its built in flight, flight or freeze responses are always on the alert for, and will always find the worst case scenario in everyday situations, it's a survival instinct that hasn't really caught up with the way we live our everyday modern lives and the basis of a lot of people's anxiety issues.

If we then expand that to the information overload we now receive on a daily basis those exact same responses can easily lead to us create paranoid doomsday interpretations of said information. It's why we're all drawn to sensationalist news stories and why the press just love throwing them our way. 

In a nutshell: We basically have an uncontrollable predisposition to worst case scenarios that has helped us as a species survive for many thousands of years.

&gt; I think I should also caveat that Nitro is not going to be a like-for-like replacement for the RSS feeds - it has a different style and structure, and it is a managed API, meaning that each consumer (public developer or BBC app) has its own rate limit so that we can manage usage and capacity. We can't guarantee that it'll be easy or even possible for things like RSS readers to use, and you'll have to check that the apps that you build against it are consistent with the service &amp; data licenses granted.

That doesn't sound like making life easier and does sound very much like an inconvenience. As it happens I use a Windows Phone.

Agree with everything you say except for this.  It's obvious that of the two CMs, Pochettino wants to have one who is primarily defensively minded, with the ability distribute passes from the back, and one with a more box-to-box orientation.  Capoue is the defensive one when he plays, and Dembele is the box-to-box type.  If Capoue is dropped, it will be for Stambouli, who fits the same mould.  If Dembele plays, it will be instead of Mason, or one of the three attacking mids.  In my opinion, Mason has earned his place in the box-to-box role, and while Dembele hasn't exactly been *bad* in that position this season, I don't think he's had too many *good* performances either, and he hardly ever produces anything of significance after his dribbling runs.  If anyone in the midfield should be dropped for the next game, I actually think it should be Eriksen.  He hasn't looked like his usual self the last few weeks, and a week off may be what he needs to get back to his usual form.  Even then, I don't think Dembele is the right man to put in; I'd like to see what kind of damage Lamela, Soldado and Kane can do up front, and Chadli should certainly be the fourth.",0,1415016716,null,0,false,0,clrmoy7,t3_2l2wnt,t1_clrmoy7,t1_clqxfd0,null,1426215282,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Its hard. Definitely doable but expect to jump through hoops.

Most the employers I spoke to wanted at a minimum proof of 417 status (worked 88 days on a farm). 

This also meant the maximum contract I could take would be 6 months, at which point they could offer me a sponsored contract at great financial cost to them.

if you're willing to live anywhere, there seems to be a ton of work in the NT but I found it a very difficult place to live and wouldn't be keen to go back to work there.

I know a few people who have fallen, very luckily, into a sponsored role but for most the ex-pats I know it has been a journey littered in red tape and hoop jumping.

Worth it though.

You are arguing that the two are mutually exclusive? Both world wars were fought for a myriad of reasons, ending fascism was one, promoting democratic and free governments was another (as is clearly seen in the Marshall plan and in the 14 points of Wilson in Versailles,) and preventing a German hegemony of Europe was another.

&gt;I will remind you that the democratically elected chamber of Imperial Germany filled with Social Democrats voted in favour of war.

This is a simplification. The socialist party was strongly anti-war, but once war became inevitable they all followed the will of the Prussian aristocracy/Kaiser, because the parliament in Germany was an advisory body with no real power, just look at how the Kaiser fired Bismark on a whim, the parliament would always be bound to follow the will of the Kaiser, because Germany was not a democracy, de facto it was far closer to the absolutist rule of the Tsars than the constitutional monarchy of the UK. The socialists had no choice but to vote for far once it was clear that the German high command had decided upon war, that in it's self reveals just how 'democratic' the empire was.

- Applications requiring a reference from the last position held, which some won't be bothered to contact due to distance/language barriers/time-difference.

- Since coming back to the UK, a *lot* of the entry-level jobs have turned into apprenticeships, which I and I believe you are too old to qualify for. The government only funds them for people between certain ages and without a degree.

- Everything entry level or not is asking for experience. People say to apply anyway, but each job is getting hundreds of applications, some of which are bound to have experience, an easily contacted reference, a more suited degree and so on.

I see a lot of ""newer"" fans really struggling with this period because they're somehow already used to winning every game just on account of last season (and the 6 months before that). And now they're turning on players or manager or staff and looking for someone to blame.

This club has mostly struggled for a very long time and as a fan you kind of have to get used to that and accept it. There has been occasional success here and there and those are some of the best moments of my life, but of course we were never even close to the level that this club was during it's golden era. 

I really liked Rafa for making us a force in Europe at least but in my opinion this is actually the first time that a new owner/manager has the means to turn Liverpool into what it was. You all got to see a preview of that last season. So it makes no sense to me to turn against Rodgers this early in the season, a manager who could be the first one in decades to have the right potential and backing to get us back on top.

There are issues like peak phosphorus, but there are ways to mitigate and avoid that which require a lot of money to implement. There's also a lot of resources problems that can be solved by either renewable or nuclear energy - fresh water is one example.

Additionally, the crude oil price is currently dropping, and is only being held high by OPEC. The recession was not a result of the oil price or of a scarcity of resources; it occurred because of central banks around the world adopting the same set of crappy policies but particularly in the US. We saw a similar crisis in the Great Depression, and that evidently wasn't because we were running out of resources.

There is no need for the biosphere to collapse to sustain our way of life. We can grow more food on less land; if the ideas of the Green Revolution had spread to Ethiopia in the '80s instead of the ideas of another, very different revolution then that country alone could feed a third of Africa. There is enormous scope for improvement, and the development of African economies will bring about an enormous increase in food production. When it comes to fish; aquaculture production is growing rapidly, while capture of wild fish is in decline. On the meat production front; there are techniques of herding cattle which improve local ecosystems rather than damage them - this is why poaching of elephants and other wildlife causes environmental degradation. If we want such techniques to spread the African economy must grow.

On the energy front; fossil fuels are a problem because of global warming - *not* because they'll soon run out. Renewable energy is getting cheaper every year, and its capacity is constantly increasing - and the means of storing it are well on the road to development. That, combined with the shale oil boom means that we won't face a real energy crisis except through political incompetence - the real problem is reducing carbon dioxide consumption. Additionally; there are new nuclear technologies being developed (and which have been developed) which greatly increase the efficiency and safety of nuclear plants; two years' production of uranium could theoretically provide as much energy as all of the oil that has ever been mined. There are also test reactors being built which will use thorium instead - and thorium has previously been used to manufacture nuclear weapons so it has promise. But again, these technologies require developed economies. And there is of course the holy grail of energy production - nuclear fusion - but as nice as it would be we won't really need it (and it will have very high capital costs even if the fuel is dirt cheap).

And to be fair....really it looks like he give a bit more credit to the smaller clubs and their fan bases (WBA, Stoke, Swansea) but nothing overly controversial about the rankings.

Crystal Palace being number 1....i think may be accurate, Selhurst is ALWAYS loud and raucous regardless of the score. Really seems like it is always a fantastic atmosphere.

I was surprised to see Stoke so high because even though they do have good support i have never thought of them as one of the electric environments in the PL. 

Everton and City i think got a bit more credit than i would expect, both can be a bit quiet at times.

Villa being 20th is in no way surprising, their atmosphere has been rapidly declining for several seasons now and yesterday was a great example of how quiet that place is on a regular basis.

First let me say that I think he's a great player, its ridiculous that he's still only 19 and playing at such a high level and I think 5 years from now who knows how good he may be. I have his jersey, I'm a huge fan. With that said, having watched pretty much every minute of his for liverpool and England, I do agree that I think the hype and expectation has been raised above his actual level of play. Sterling really came out last year but I remember a player who also struggled with finishing and key decision making and seemed to benefit a lot from being on such a dynamic team overall. Then the offseason began. (Yes there was the world cup where he played well, but 3 games that include 2 losses and a weak draw and 0 goals for raheem to me can't be considered an ""amazing"" showing). Somehow from the end of last season, where I saw a player who was just coming to be and still had much to learn (I honestly considered Coutinho to be at a very similar level of play with possibly better decision making at times) to the beginning of this season, Sterling became a top player in the world. And clearly this isn't his fault. But I don't think he's quite as good YET as everyone was thinking or expecting. So theres going to continue to be this surprise from people if he scores less than 10 EPL goals this year and doesn't take command of the team when there really shouldn't be. liverpool are not playing well and Raheem isn't on that absolute top level yet. And again i want to be clear its not like this is his fault, its the nature of sports and and sports talk, and he's been hyped to a level that is unsubstantiated (He would have to the fcking 2nd coming of Pele` to substantiate it). Let him become great before constantly talking about how great he is/is going to be.

&gt;feminist advertisements asking for money to cater to the 10% of women who are homeless

Example?

&gt;I give many fucks that male genital mutilation is legal

As do I. However, MGM is commonly brought up in discussions of FGM, often when it is only tangentially related.

&gt;I care that the number of female peadophiles and rapists has been supressed by the actions of militant feminists for decades

I'm very interested in any information about this. Google isn't helping.

&gt;I care that when Erin Pizzey tried to follow up her excellent work with women's shelters to help the comparable amount of men trapped in violent relationships, feminist groups threatened her life, killed her pets and she needed police protection before going into hiding for a decade.

Pizzey's shelters for men failed due to other reasons, as she writes in This Way To The Revolution:

&gt;""We opened the house, and I faced another stark reality. Whereas filling a house with women and children resulted in the women quickly forming a community and taking charge of their own lives, filling a house with men resulted in them disappearing into a room and sitting helplessly on their beds or else sulking because their was no one to run the place and take care of cooking and other practical matters.
&gt;In vain we talked to them about the set-up in Chiswick. We talked about self-help. We talked about how we would decorate the satellite houses ourselves as well as do minor repairs. We talked about their responsibility to care for one another. We met with blank silence. They were not only unwilling or incapable of caring for each other in the house but we were unable to get any male volunteers to help out.""

Pizzey is an interesting character: Her shelters were pioneering, but her beliefs are rather odious in my opinion. She has said, for example: ""To me, the definition of domestic violence is quite clear: if you are not in fear of your life, you are not suffering it.""

&gt;Now a lot of people like to pop in when I make a post like this and and call me some misogynistic woman beater or accuse me of some brand of idiocy or other or perhaps I'm living in some fantasy world. I will usually at this time point out that my SO is an academic feminist

Fallacy corner! I see what looks like a strawman and an appeal to authority. Perhaps poisoning the well, too.

&gt;Hoth Sommers is a great example, basically ignored by feminism and loved by everyone else

I wouldn't say that she's ignored exactly. Those who identify themselves as ""equity feminists"" - coined by CHS - include: Jean Bethke Elshtain, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, Noretta Koertge, Donna Laframboise, Mary Lefkowitz, Carrie Lukas, Wendy McElroy, Camille Paglia, Daphne Patai, Virginia Postrel, Alice Rossi, Nadine Strossen, Joan Kennedy Taylor, Cathy Young, and Steven Pinker.

&gt;while it is true that men as a whole earn more money than women it is largely because women want more flexible hours, more sociable working conditions and very few have the desire to do the dangerous jobs that pay high wages.

It's certainly a valid hypothesis. The latest [ONS data](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/patterns-of-pay/1997-to-2012-ashe-results/patterns-of-pay-2012.html#tab-Results-by-occupation) that I could find has a breakdown of pay gaps by sector (figure 14). The ""dangerous jobs"" explanation may account for the massive gaps in skilled trades and machine operatives. Can the desire for flexibility explain the pay gap of 18.2% for managers and directors?

That said, there is no reason we cannot offer FoM between the listed countries while simultaneously being a member of the EU. It is not an either/or proposition while we retain control of such affairs.

You mean when they were in their prime and Sturridge was stuck on the bench of a team that is notoriously bad at allowing youth a chance? That is extremely selective. In the 2 years Sturridge has been here, he's averaging more goals per game than Van Persie has at any club, even United while in his prime. 

2 Years of that deserves recognition. Rooney doesn't play as striker anymore and when he does he's a completely different type of forward to Sturridge. If Sturridge could stay fit, he could quite easily be regarded as a top bracket striker with his games to goal ratio. 

The fact he's still being underrated in his own sub is a testament to how big Suarez's shadow loomed over him. I think he got 21 goals in 29 games last season. Including sub appearances after injury. For comparison Lewandowski got 20 in 33.

Sample quotes from wikipedia:

&gt;Future ocean acidification could threaten coral reefs, fisheries, protected species, and other natural resources of value to society.[159][162]

#
&gt;Some large-scale changes could occur abruptly, i.e., over a short time period, and might also be irreversible. An example of abrupt climate change is the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost, which would lead to amplified global warming.[167][168]

#
&gt;
Food: Crop production will probably be negatively affected in low latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative.[176] Global warming of around 4.6 °C relative to pre-industrial levels could pose a large risk to global and regional food security.[177]
Health: Generally impacts will be more negative than positive.[178] Impacts include: the effects of extreme weather, leading to injury and loss of life;[179] and indirect effects, such as undernutrition brought on by crop failures.[180]

#
&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 160,000 deaths, since 1950, are directly attributable to climate change. Many believe[weasel words] this to be a conservative estimate.[5]

#
&gt;A report on the global human impact of climate change published by the Global Humanitarian Forum in 2009, estimated more than 300,000 deaths and about $125 billion in economic losses each year, and indicating that most climate change induced mortality is due to worsening floods and droughts in developing countries.[8]

From 2006 to 2007, my friends and I studied abroad in London. I had decided I needed to go home over the winter break because I was getting homesick. The airline I flew was Virgin Atlantic. If you ever get a chance to fly them, I HIGHLY recommend it. Well they had a swank in flight entertainment system, and I thought I'd check out this Doctor Who thing I'd heard about. The first episode I watched was Fear Her. I very much enjoyed it. It was such a refreshing change from what I was used to, the hero wasn't there to simply kill the bad guy, he wanted to help, and that spoke to me. That said, the thing that sealed the deal and made me a Whovian for life was the next time preview for Army of Ghosts. It was crazy looking: ghosts, robots, lasers, I loved it and had to have more.

We need to address the rightback issue in January and free up Isla to play on the right side of midfield, and I'll say again - we should look to replicate what is working for us by finding a 90 minute Bobby Zamora from somewhere. I'd prioritise this over Defoe or Crouch.

After the international break we have a nice, long run of games where we shouldn't be hanging back looking to bounce away attacks like pinball flippers against the likes of Chelsea and Man City. We need to look at cushioning that god awful goal difference.

I think Burnley are almost certainly going straight back down to feat on their riches in the Championship. Only having to leapfrog two teams might be a rare luxury. However I'm guessing these two are coming from the current Sunderland - Stoke group. I can't imagine us comfortably pulling away from any of them, but we'll see.

&gt; High-visibility (HV) clothing, a type of personal protective equipment (PPE), is any clothing worn that has highly reflective properties or a colour that is easily discernible from any background.

You seem to be hung up on pedantic issues about the terminology of hi-viz, but your statement of ""Hi viz converts UV (from the sun) to visible light"" is misleading because it only tells part of the story. High-visiblity clothing is, in general, as I mentioned, made of two types of material: a fluorescent and/or bright coloured majority and reflective strips.

&gt; and unlike builders clothes you can get sports wear with either one or the other (or both)

I did a Google image search of ""high visibility sports wear"", and in the first couple of screens of results I couldn't see a single example which didn't sport at least some reflective material (some were a little light on it, but that's by-the-by). I have no doubt that there exist some products which market themselves as ""high visibility"" and don't have reflective strips, but note that ""high-visibility"" isn't a specific material (which you seem to be claiming).

Colloquially, when people talk about ""hi-viz"" (note the general shortening of the phrase) they're referring to the combination of the fluorescent material and reflective strips. I could describe my white t-shirt as ""high-visibility"" because it's lightly coloured, but I would never describe it as ""hi-viz"".

You reference your formal encounters with hi-viz gear below, but given you're trying to swing people that your statement are more ""formally"" correct as a fellow engineer I disagree with you entirely. Not only is your statement incorrect by a formal standard, it is misleading in an informal capacity to make people think that wearing hi-viz clothing doesn't help.",0,1415026143,null,0,false,0,clrp7j3,t3_2l59hb,t1_clrp7j3,t1_clroo6k,null,1426214066,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The reason those countries are so devastated is because *we* are consuming their resources and leaving them with all the shit to clear up.

Secondly, oil price is still very high by historic standards.  The inflation adjusted post WWII average is about $30, and we're nearly 3x that at $80-85.  Conventional production peaked in [2005](http://www.euanmearns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/global_C-C_jun14.png).  That was the time when oil [price went inelastic](http://www.capgemini.com/sites/default/files/sustainability-blog/files/2012/02/oil-economics.jpg).  New sources are coming online from more expensive sources (shale oil $50/barrel, canadian tar sands closer to $100, brazillian deepwater about $110), so don't expect the price fall to last all that long, since it'll knock a load of marginal production out and then we'll be back to high prices again.  Historically [oil shocks and recessions are linked](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/oil_history.pdf).  The recent high price of oil ($100+ for 3-4 years) is almost certainly in the recession inducing level for developed nations.  The OPEC conspiracy theory is bollocks.  They've been pumping out as fast as they can to take advantage of the highest oil price ever.  The real reason price is high is that we hit conventional peak in 2005, and the Chinese are outbidding the developed economies for oil.  Besides which, the problem has never been about running out of oil, it's about sustaining a flow of energy.  It's that ultimately the resources get of such low quality that harvesting them gives you less and less net energy, which is reflected via the price, and eventually it becomes unviable.  Presently nothing is substituting for oil, so I expect another energy crisis and recession by the end of the decade.

The green revolution is predicated on turning 10 calories of fossil fuel energy into 1 calorie of food energy.  Without oil modern agriculture is nonviable.  Aggressive use of pesticides and herbicides completely fucks up soil ecology, and use of artificial fertilizers (specifically nitrogen, generated from the haber process, which needs natural gas to work) messes things up even more, and results in pretty serious algal blooms to boot.  Topsoil erosion is a pretty big threat.  Something like 50% of topsoil has been lost in the last 150 years.  We're making up for this by cutting down swaths of the amazon, but when that's all gone?  What then?

Worldwide non-hydro renewables provide around 1.5% of all energy consumption.  This is not yet impressive.  Storage [generally knocks renewables into uneconomic territory](http://bravenewclimate.com/2014/08/22/catch-22-of-energy-storage/).  Most renewables are presently not fungible with oil as a transport fuel, which is going to be a problem that hits us sooner rather than later.  The extremely low EROEI of renewables generally is a big issue that's never really addressed by their advocates, despite it being an absolutely key metric.

Nuclear [probably isn't scalable](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=06021978), and fusion is a pipe dream.  Throughput of uranium/thorium to reach the level required would be difficult, to achieve at best.  Let's see where India and China are with their thorium by 2020, mind.  I'm ex nuclear industry, and to be honest I left it very disillusioned.  I think it's had it's day ,and was a failure.

And nuclear is only useful for desalination if you're near a coast!  Half of china's rapidly depleting fossil aquifers are in the middle of the country.  Same with the US.  It's going to be a serious, serious problem within the next 20-30 years [good book on the subject](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Price-Thirst-Global-Inequality/dp/0816695423).

I started out a few years thinking the same as you, that it would be easy to get everyone living like we do in the west, that peak oil was a myth and that the green part were morons.  The I actually *looked at data* and realised that in terms of energy use, resource depletion and many other indicators that unless radical change comes, and soon, that we are going to be desperately fucked before 2050.

There absolutely is. We're going to be building a new stadium in like the next two years. Levy will tighten our pursestrings even further, which leaves us with a smaller budget, so youth have to step up and fill in squad rotation gaps in the short-medium term future. 

We've also sunk something like 50 million into the youth setup, so there's a financial point in giving the academy some first team chances, so ENIC and co can begin seeing returns on that investment.

There's no reason for an adult not to have an emergency fund and it will have a huge positive impact on your financial stability, waiting on pay day so you can pay bills is really not good. 

Also you should avoid short term credit like Wonga because of the impact that it will have on the way you look to other financial service companies: until those Wonga credit arrangements drop off your credit report (6 years from the end of the agreement) every company you want to do financial business with (banks, mortgage lenders...) will know about those loans, and they will see it as a sign of financial irresponsibility (so little planning that you need those short term loans). This isn't good and depending on your life plans it can have a negative impact on your future.

Anyway specific to this problem: 1. Wonga make money hand over fist from their *normal* business, they have no reason to try and ""trick"" people into accidentally owing them money, any suggestion they would do that is nonsense. 2. If the money was mistakenly sent to you: You have no legal right to that money, you should return it to Wonga. Your first action should be to login to your Wonga account and check that there isn't a loan out in your name, if there is you can repay it directly. If there isn't a loan out in your name (and the payment is mistaken -- very unlikely) phone Wonga and explain.

I disagree. I'm very pleased that we have retained wigs and gowns as symbols of the law. It's a permanent reminder to the people that wear them that although they represent it, they are not themselves the law. (The importance of this becomes very clear if you see how some American judges behave.)

But as well as keeping them 'in check' it also offers them protection. It reminds others that judges are only representatives of the law. It's not Joe Bloggs who sends someone down--it's the wig which sends them down. I believe there was a vote among the judiciary (or at least a poll) about wigs and this was one of the main arguments in favour IIRC.

There are some arguments against them but I reject absolutely the suggestion that a 16 year old would be unable to communicate because of a fancy hat. A wig could cause a retrial?

His laws on whether or not you can change the past or future change from episode to episode, depending on if he wants to be dramatic. The Moon? Earth's history is fine to rewrite! Rory and Amy? Pink? Can't rewrite time!

5.01 - The Eleventh Hour

5.02/03 - Shows a bit of character development, but less important if you watched Who before season 5

5.04/05 - Two parts, very plot important

5.07 - Amy's Choice - Character development, little series plot. (plot skip, long watch recommend, 5.06 helps this episode)

5.08/09 - Two Parts, Probably one of the few plot important multi-part episodes I'd suggest a skip (but you need to know the end of 09)

5.10 - Vincent and the Doctor - Minor to long plot, very good episode, sadly could skip on speed watch
5.11 - The Lodger (good, but could skip, minor ties to some plot season 6)
5.12/13 - Finale

Space + Time - Silly webisodes, no plot importance, could be a fun watch.

6.01/02 - The Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon

6.04 - The Doctor's Wife (Major Sideplot)

6.05/06 The Rebel Flesh / The Almost People (Like 5.08/09 in that watch is needed for plot, but not strongly recommended ) 

6.07 - A Good Man Goes to War

6.08 - Let's Kill Hitler 

6.10 - The Girl Who Waited (Less season plot important, more drama important, if a skip or not varies from person to person )

6.11 - The God Complex 

6.12 - Closing Time ( Ties back to 5.11, good episode and some plot importance, but could skip if in a rush or skipped 5.11)

6.13 - The Wedding of River Song (Finale)

7.01 - Asylum of the Daleks

7.02 - Dinosaurs on a Spaceship ( Drama plot, but somewhat important )

7.04 - The Power of Three (Same as 7.03, both are fun to watch at least)

7.05 - The Angels Take Manhattan (Finale of sorts)


2012 Xmas Special (Sidenote, numbering can be a bit off here given the way the season split)

7.06 The Bells of Saint John (If you wanted after this you could skip to finale) 

7.07 /08 /09 /10 - All these are side episodes 7.09 &amp; 7.10 have some plot hints and threads, but all could be skipped on a speed watch.

7.11 - The Crimson Horror ( Almost a Doctor lite side episode. Only minor Drama plot, but 'fun' to watch) 

7.12 - Nightmare in Silver  (Tied to previous episode's ending, drama plot as compared to major. )

7.13 - The Name of the Doctor (Finale)

Webisode - 'The night of the Doctor' (Major fan shout-out, and plot important but not in a way you would expect ) 

7.14 - The Day of the Doctor

7.15 - The Time of the Doctor

8.01 - Deep Breath

8.04 - Listen (Drama Plot, good episode)

8.05 - Time Heist (Fun side-episode )

8.06 - The Caretaker (Fun side-episode )

8.08 - Mummy On The Orient Express (Side Episode, but Drama plot and semi major )

8.09 - Flatline (Doctor Lite episode, plot important)

8.11 - Dark Water (Finale Pt. 1)

He just seemed to have trouble staying on the pitch, and some people (myself included) felt Willian was in better form and deserved to start over Oscar.  This year has been completely different, he's been available for every match I believe and has played all over the pitch.  His versatility makes him a unique player, but his work rate and willingness to go back to defend and make tackles all over the pitch make him a special player.  Oscar can play in the 10 role, or on the right, he can play deeper in more of an 8 role.  Not a lot of players are willing or competent in all those roles.  He can score some incredible goals, but he's an extremely industrious player who will always put his body on the line.  Oscar has also shown that he will work as hard as possible whenever he is on the pitch (even while losing 7-0).

We were pretty much *abused* by a 14 year old girl though. She became my nemesis. She'd get into various rooms in the building and break / nick stuff, and I once found her literally cornering the chess club in a room, with a stick. When I got her to leave, she hit the fire alarm on the way out and just stood in front of me in the courtyard, waiting for the fire brigade to come. We had to evacuate about 300 people from various corners of the building, and one of the firemen told us she'd pulled the same shit with two hotels up the road on the same evening. She then got chased through the courtyard by  a grown man, giving us the finger on the way out.

She then came back and spray painted the glass doors with a big anarchy sign (again in front of me), and when we called the police they got me to jump in the back of the car as we shot down the road, so I could point her out if I saw her. They went straight to Dumbiedykes.

The culmination of her efforts came when we caught her smoking in the ladies' bathroom on the first floor. The building manager and I basically blocked her from leaving and called University security (grumpy ex-coppers), who turned up and told us we weren't really allowed to detain her there, and definitely shouldn't touch her. She made a couple of runs round us for the front door, but who happened to be drinking in the bar? Motherfucking *chess club*. 

This huge, gentle giant-type guy just bear hugs her and drops her back in the building, causing her to bolt up the stairs. Realising she has no way out, and aware that we've called the police (this really was the last straw), she grabbed a flipping fire extinguisher. We didn't figure this out until the bearded, pony-tailed, pirate-movie-extra building manager cautiously poked his head up the stairs to investigate a lack of noise and got thoroughly soaked.  

Once she had exhausted one water extinguisher, she picked up a second and fired it down the stairs. I will never forget the cctv footage of the guy just standing there with a grin on his face, getting absolutely *drenched* by a little girl with a grudge. 

The problems started when she ran out of water fire extinguishers and re-appeared with the CO2. I think she sensed how dangerous it was when we freaked out, although I'll admit we both exchanged a glance that said ""*can* we let this little bugger freeze her fingers off?""

Upon putting that down (alright, throwing it down), the police appeared. Casually sauntering through the doors, they were greeted with what looked like a movie set: a 14 year old girl in ripped jeans and leather jacket, dripping wet deck-hand, light fittings dripping water puddles onto a flooded floor, thirty excited student faces pressed up against the glass doors of the bar.

She makes a dash for the CO2 fire extinguisher next to her, and the younger of the two policemen straight up *spear tackles* her into the ground. She got dragged out to the van in cuffs, but I think they let her go as she's a minor. We didn't see her again, but we *did* keep the bike she foolishly left outside the front door for her getaway.

That isn't to say there aren't those in other positions...

This all reminds me of the ""SWAMPED"" threads the other day. We had one thread where this left leaning subreddits users were aghast that a minister was suggesting the UK was swamped with immigrants, whilst in another along the lines of ""Is you're area actually swamped?"" most users (many of them the same ones from the other thread!) were by and large agreeing that yes, indeed, there area had received an extraordinary number of immigrants.

At any rate, if we are going to take unskilled labourers I'd sooner see it coming from NZ/AUS/Canada/the USA or even the commonwealth... because by and large those people would be anglophiles coming to the UK because they want to engage in British society. Not because they want to make as much money as they can and send it back home to their family, whilst retaining as much of their cultural identity as possible.

If we get enough points there, and restore ourselves to the 1:1 games:points ratio that marks the bare minimum of what you need to stay in the PL, then I think we'll go on to stay up. If not, I think we'll get relegated.

The reason I think these games are so important is not necessarily purely the points (we actually have some kind fixtures in the beginning of 2015), but rather because of momentum. There seems to be a kind of magnifying effect hovering over this club. Whatever happens, it happens for us 10x more intensely. 

When it goes bad for us, it goes *bad*. Memories of past failures, the woeful state of our club in 2012, Bosingwa-gate, desperate failed signings -- it all comes flooding back. Calls for the manager to resign. Accusations that the chairman is incompetent. Claims that the players don't care and are only in it for the paycheque. If we go into January with the club in that state, we won't recover.

However, we are currently in the opposite condition. We've played well three games now and the feeling around the team and the supporters is resurgent and positive. All of a sudden everyone believes. But if we lose to City and lose to Newcastle away -- which is, let's face it, the likely outcome -- we'll be at 12 games played with 7 points to show for it. If we don't restore ourselves to the 1:1 benchmark immediately afterwards, I fear the downwards spiral will start again. And it'll be deja vu for the rest of the season.

false,matcht,lfc12,,"It is easy to say we didn't buy quality after the fact, and even easier to say we should have but in reality we couldn't have signed Di Maria or Falcao. I also don't think Rojo and Shaw are better than Lovren and Moreno.

But we do have to question our scouting team and our choice of signings from what is out there. Was Lallana worth £25m when players like Sanchez and Fabregas are going for similar amounts? Is Lovren really worth being one of the top 10 most expensive center backs ever, and then placing him in a completely different defensive system? Why sign Markovic when we have a plethora of young winger/attackers, and who will take time to adapt when we need an immediate contribution? Why sign Balotelli when he is clearly not the right fit for our system?

More than issues of quality, I have to question our aim or strategy in the market. Only Moreno seems to be a smart signing, and possibly Can but we've seen little of him. He's young but adds something right away, fits our philosophy and signed at a good price. 

Of all of Rodgers signings before this summer, only Sturridge and Coutinho, and only down to lack of replacements, Mignolet, managed to become regular first team players. That is very disappointing.

Also, I'm not one ready to give up on Rodgers but we've gained a little perspective on him defensively. For all of last season I blamed Skrtel, Johnson, Kolo etc for much of our defensive woes (next to our system of we'll outscore you), but honestly aside from Johnson, all of the defenders at his disposal have been quality before he arrived or at other clubs. He has now signed 7 defenders since he's been here, and yet we still have the same issues. He can't really have the same excuse as he had before that they weren't the right defenders for our system. He signed Lovren and then plays a deep line. I am starting to doubt whether he can fix any of our defensive issues long term, I am beginning to think it is simply a weakness of his that he cannot address out of ego or ignorance.",0,1415031465,null,0,1415031760,0,clrrkpr,t3_2l5t6m,t1_clrrkpr,t3_2l5t6m,null,1426212951,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Now they have no pressing incentive to keep him, and if they want to make anything for him they'll have to sell him at this point or he has the opportunity to walk for free. So point is, given these new circumstances, I could see Dnipro not only not stalling, but actually helping to see out the deal this time around were anyone interested.

As for J Rod, I don't like the idea of him playing wide and I hope Poch has figured out that it won't work with how teams defend against us. J Rod thrived on making runs in behind against spaced out and high back lines, not running at them. Teams almost never play high against us, as in fact they play very low and very tight because they know how easy it is to confound us with such a tactic. Despite all of J Rod's ability and work ethic, he isn't the type to run at these compact boxes. I think he'll be just as clueless with how to unlock them as our current lot is. This is why I think we need the ability of Kono or Ayew who like to aggressively dribbling *straight at* opposing defenses at pace, but who can also shoot or have the ability to get to the byline for a cross to stretch these compact boxes back out.

Can you provide an example of this that isn't 'The Eleventh Hour' ? If you're referring to when 10 replaced the sonic he 'burned out' on the X-ray machine, that was an entire season after his regeneration.

Going from 3rd Doctor to 4th and 5th there was no change, it was a modification for the purpose of story. A magnet was added so that the sonic could open bolted doors.

The 5th Doctor lost it some time in Season 19, and it wasn't seen again for some time.

The version we see that 7 has in his toolkit, during Paul McGann's appearance as the Doctor does not get destroyed.

The 8th Doctor receives a wooden handled one in the audios, but I don't really know how true that version is with respect to the history of the sonic.

It's never discussed how the 9th Doctor gets his screwdriver (unless it's been covered in prose somewhere that I haven't read yet)

&gt;

&gt;&gt;*Unless otherwise specified, Chinese texts in this article are written in ([Simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese)/[Traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese); [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin)) format. In cases where Simplified and Traditional Chinese scripts are identical, the Chinese term is written once.*

&gt;__Chinese__ ^i/tʃaɪˈniːz/ (汉语 / 漢語; *Hànyǔ* or 中文; *Zhōngwén*) is a group of related but in many cases [mutually unintelligible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility) language [varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics\)), forming a branch of the [Sino-Tibetan language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_languages). Chinese is spoken by the [Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese) majority and many other ethnic groups in [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China). Nearly 1.2 billion people (around 16% of the world's population) speak some form of Chinese as their [first language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language).

&gt;The [varieties of Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese) are usually described by native speakers as dialects of a single Chinese language, but linguists note that they are as diverse as a [language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_family).  The internal diversity of Chinese has been likened to that of the [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages), but may be even more varied. There are between 7 and 13 main regional groups of Chinese (depending on classification scheme), of which the most spoken, by far, is [Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese) (about 960 million), followed by [Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Chinese) (80 million), [Yue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Chinese) (70 million) and [Min](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Chinese) (70 million). Most of these groups are mutually unintelligible, although some, like [Xiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiang_Chinese) and the Southwest Mandarin dialects, may share common terms and some degree of intelligibility. All varieties of Chinese are [tonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics\)) and [analytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_language).

&gt;[Standard Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese) *(Putonghua/Guoyu/Huayu)* is a standardized form of spoken Chinese based on the [Beijing dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_dialect) of Mandarin. It is the official language of [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) and [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan), as well as one of four official languages of [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore). It is one of the [six official languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_languages_of_the_United_Nations) of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations). The [written form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Chinese) of the standard language (中文; *Zhōngwén*), based on the [logograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logograms) known as [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters) (汉字/漢字; *hànzi*), is shared by literate speakers of otherwise unintelligible dialects.

&gt;Of the other varieties of Chinese, [Cantonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese) (the prestige variety of Yue) is influential in [Guangdong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong) province and Cantonese-speaking overseas communities and remains one of the official languages of [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong) (together with [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language)) and of [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau) (together with [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language)). [Min Nan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Nan), part of the Min group, is widely spoken in southern [Fujian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian), in neighbouring Taiwan (where it is known as [Taiwanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien) or Hoklo) and in [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia) (also known as [Hokkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien) in the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines), Singapore, and [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia)). There are also sizeable [Hakka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka) and [Shanghainese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghainese) [diasporas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora), for example in Taiwan, where most Hakka communities are also conversant in Taiwanese and Standard Chinese.

By creating prosperous and stable democracies...

&gt;The USA was not interested in spreading Democracy

It clearly was, from Wilson's 14 points to the reconstruction of Europe and Japan. Do you have any evidence that the US was not interested in spreading democracy or is the might of strongly help opinion your only source?

&gt;  It was interested in stopping Communism. Which is why they allied with Francoist Spain, Dictatorial Greece, the Fascists of South Korea etc.

The US practised realpoltik, which means working with the assumption that the real world will never be ideal and thus politics must be pragmatic. Kissinger is on record saying that when possible the USA wanted to create and support democracies, but if that did not seem like a plausible solution, it was quite content to ally itself with fascist like governments so long as those governments were dedicated to fighting communism. Just because the USA hate communism more than it loved Democracy does not mean that it had not interest in spreading the latter.

&gt;Stopping German hegemony was the only reason the wars were fought.

Ohh boy is this the grossest over simplification of the politics of the early 20th century. I can't even argue against something so detached from historic accuracy.

&gt;The Socialists supported war because the German people wanted war

The socialists were fervently anti war right up until it was made clear that war was going to happen. Hell the socialists had an anti war rally in Vienna just 2 months before the war broke out. You seem to be just inventing history to suit your agenda here. But yes the majority of the French and German people were pro war, but the socialists never were.

&gt;In WW1 there was wide enthusiasm for war amongst the German people and all the parties besides the Communists backed the war effort for that reason.

No you have it backwards. The Government wanted war and created wide enthusiasm for the war, both in France and in Germany. You merley need to look at the Morocco incident of 1912 to see that the German government had set it's path upon war, and you need to merely have read All is Quiet on The Wester Front to see that a top down cultural view of the support for war was implemented.

I genuinely think Can, Origi, Lallana, Moreno and Manquillo 100% have long futures ahead with us. None of them (bar Lallana) are the finished product and they are obviously signings for the future.

Lovren has been poor. Yep. But it happens. Find me a manager who has a 100% success record in a summer transfer window and I'll call you a liar. Brendan was forced to overpay due to him having PL experience, and it being very well known how much money Suarez brought in.

I have serious doubts over Markovic, but again he is young and he has time on his side. I think it's ridiculous to begin writing players off.

And finally, Mario. If I had to sum up my first impressions in a sentence I'd say: ""Played alright, could score more"". Despite what the naysayers say he has shown he is willing to put the effort in. He tries to press but he is often extremely isolated as we don't have many viable strike partners. If he had been a little luckier he could have had 4 or 5 by now.

It's November. Our squad has just seen it's biggest overhaul in years. We are packed with youth and still suffering with a hangover from last season and the shock of losing our talisman. We are still well within contention for a top 4 place.

You are pretending that there was just one agenda of the USA from 1918 until the end of the cold war. there was not. For instance while Wilson wanted to promote Democracy the President that followed him did not see any point in it. You are cherrypicking instances in US history to support your viewpoint. Also, the Americans became involved in WW1 for the reasoning that they had loaned the British and French so much money that if they lost it would be disastrous for the USA. Wilson said that himself.

Youa re confusing two matters in US policy. Thje wars were thought to stop the Germans dominating Europe and to protect the US interests. The Democractic side was an afterthought in the wake of victory.

Wilson promoted Democracy after victory, not during it. The same in the case of Wilson and FDR/Truman.

Vienna was not part of Germany in the time before WW1. Your understanding of history and consequence is poor. You are talking about Austrian Socialists not German Socialists.

The French people wanted war for reasons of revanchism. They felt that they had been humiliated in the Franco-Prussian war and they wanted revenge.

I'm sure everyone would agree that Swansea was the team that played the best and most eye-pleasing football that season, just like Liverpool did last. I don't think that's a coincidence, or a ""blip"". I think there's something special about Brendan which is pretty frightening considering he is still very young and still improving as a manager.

You use two locks. While cycling, wrap them around you. Not only does this look cool, but also offers a fraction more torso protection. When locking, you lock the rear wheel and the frame to the thing you're locking to, and with the other you lock the front wheel to the bike, and to the anchor point if you can.

EDIT:

In my time as a courier, I had two locks similar to [this](https://d4273fcd06b58c503e0d-be09c6238317b53550d1ee969c84f0fa.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/19914.jpg).

I don't get how your not understanding this, giving a tax break to the top 10% does not incentive them to spend more when they are the bracket that spends the least of their income. Left and right wing wing economists agree that the top 10% spend far less relative to their income than any other tax bracket.

If they had followed their own logic then wouldn't the people who spend more also have gotten a lowering of their income tax? It's blatant bullshit and insulting that they think the public is that dumb.

It absolutely baffles me that anyone not in the 10% would vote for a party clearly through their funding is controlled by businesses. Look at the number they have pulled on Ed, people say he is 'unelectible'... you don't vote on who is the PM you vote on a MP and their party. 

Sure you can say labour are controlled by unions, and to a certain extent that is true, you can say lib dems are backstabbing wankers but it's clear as day they traded it for the failed AV ref.

You said...

&gt; decreasing income tax to the best off is just a massive middle finger to everyone else.

This is the nonsensical core of your argument. I'll repeat: raising the top rate of Income Tax is about making the poor *think* you are doing something about inequality, without *actually* doing anything about it. It's dishonest.

I'm well into the top 10% of earners. My Income Tax bill is microscopic - I'm nowhere near paying the top rate - although the other taxes I pay more than compensate the Exchequer for that.

If we tax consumption any more we'll lower economic growth and any other possible taxes such as increased inheritance tax is both politically impossible and likely to fall to the same issues that taxing higher earners suffers. 

So in practicality the only thing we have left is cuts to balance the budget in the short term, and then to rely on economic growth to provide budget increases in the long term. Problem there is of course that *other than the state pension* everything has already been cut to shite. Its a bad situation really, but hey ho.

You literally said that... and the report says there would be increase in tax receipts if they highered it back up to 50% if only marginal.

Raising VAT is obviously a bad idea, lowering the income tax of best off is also a bad idea and the report literally says the government gets more money if it didn't do it. This is the only part I disagree with you on, tax break to best off who spend less is a terrible idea... and no I don't think you should pay more taxes. 

I'm not out with a pitchfork saying 'The rich should pay!' but I'm against the idea of lowering the income tax for the best off whilst fucking the poor over with sanction targets when the report you linked says we would of been better off keeping it at 50% (I have no idea how we're even arguing about this).

""What this shows is that realistically we can't take the income of the top earners any more than we already do.""

We can.. I'm not for it but it sounds like the kind of shite that had people running scared about national min wage. Do you plan on moving if we raise it back up to 50%?

There not short term cuts, they are long term cuts... freezing public sector wages is a long term solution in that they will be payed much less in real terms and in a few years they will get paid inflation rise increases.

Once wages catch up back to over inflation levels of before 2007 taking into account the 7 years of inflation then yeah things will be hey-ho then.

I posted the other day how I was worried that our football had been horrific and we NEED to see an improvement in performances soon, even if like the 1st season the points don't flow as freely as last season. If there is progression and a plan and the football is good then he will buy himself some breathing room from the vast majority imo.

By far though my biggest concern is our defence, Rodgers has had significant time to show he is capable at shoring the defence up and has so far failed to convince me at all. Defenders come and get worse instead of better and some of this has to be on Rodgers or his coaches. We concede silly goals and at an alarming regularity, set pieces make our defence shit themselves and this has been going on for almost 2 and a half years under him. This is my biggest concern.

We can say we concede more because we attack and score more but taking out last seasons matches his record is 69 games with 115 goals for and 84 against. That is an alarming amount of goals to concede and we have to face it that if we want to return to the top that is an area we absolutely need to improve in. Mourinho has conceded only 35 more goals in 116 more games, he is far better obviously but this highlights the point. 

Overall I'm happy to give Rodgers more time but if Sturridge is back soon which we expect and it gets to January and we're still playing like this conceding joke goals every game and creating very little I would say it would be silly not to consider our options based off 1 season in which it was obvious our attack absolutely carried us.

If I wanted to save money, and had an ideological belief that the private sector was much more efficient that the public sector, then I would *also* use this mechanism.

Ultimately we have a conspiracy theory here, that all politicians are involved in sneaking in an incredibly unpopular and unwanted change, and nobody - no politician, no civil servant, no lobbyist - is willing to tell us about, or attempt to sabotage, and is going to take so many decades to implement that the people who were involved in the early stages will have retired by the time they see the completion.

And even the greatest proponents of the NHS accept *some* private tender. It's not like the NHS manufactures its own tongue depressors. That's outsourced to private companies. Is this a bad thing? Even some fundamental parts of the health care system are outsourced. Pharmacies are private businesses and GPs are independent contractors.

Following this admission, the judge ordered a series of psychiatric assessments, which concluded that he was of sound mind when he was carrying out the attack. That conclusion meant he was deemed fit to stand trial for her murder.

So with an average house price of £250,000 they will need £62,500 deposit for one house.

Is Manquillo really any better than Kelly, Wisdom, or Flanagan?

Is Markovic any better than Ibe?

Origi looks decent, but he isn't here so is irrelevant right now.

Can I quite like, always have done since he was at Bayern, but is he what we needed this season to get us into the top 4 again?

Moreno is better than Enrique, so of those is really the only one I would say will have any impact this season and perhaps Can if he can work his way into the starting 11 regularly.

Of the rest: 

Lallana is a good player, but we paid a bit too much for him and I'm not sure he offers enough of an upgrade/difference from Henderson/Coutinho/Allen.  Overall a good signing though, IMO.

Balotelli I thought at the time was an awful signing and nothing has convinced me I was wrong.

Lambert for the price paid is a decent backup to have but due to his back problems he can't really train properly and needs to be playing regularly to stay in any sort of form.  Given that, I don't see how we can really accommodate him although I do really like him and hope he does well for us. 

Lovren I don't know what to think of.  He was pretty expensive and so far looks a shadow of himself.  That said, all of our CBs look poor when I know they're not, so not sure how much of the blame is due to his ability versus other factors.

So overall, I'd say we didn't really resolve any of the issues we had (except perhaps at LB) so for me, the signings are poor not because of ability or potential necessarily but due to how they fit in the side.  Defense is still a problem, we have no real replacement for Suarez or even a striker of note as long as Daniel is out, our keeper is still Mignolet, and we still only have Lucas (who doesn't even make the bench for some reason most games) as a proper CDM.",0,1415040556,null,0,false,0,clrwcjx,t3_2l5t6m,t1_clrwcjx,t1_clrsxg8,null,1426210724,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

false,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"I think that Martinez's did a good job at Wigan in terms of development. Wigan barely had an academy, and had pennies to spend, and whilst other managers with small budgets were getting aging players on a free, he was consistently investing in risky youth products and developing them into proper players.

Off the top of my head in his time there he brought through McCarthy, McArthur, Moses and Cattermole- probably others. Whilst it clearly wasn't his sole focus, he did a pretty good job of incorporating developing players into the side- and is continuing to do so at Everton. 

Bear in mind that Lukaku, McCarthy, Stones and Barkley are all 23 or under, and have all shone under Martinez. Besic has also started making waves, and he was commended by Barca top brass for his work with Deulofeu last year. 

As I am sure you are aware, developing players is not an overnight thing. Although Moyes reputedly ignored the academy,  the players were still being developed to hopefully fit into his Everton side, meaning that development trajectories of players would have to have been reset over last season, and they will have had to have learned many different things to operate under our current system. 

Centrebacks are the main change here. Moyes used to prefer more of an old school physical defender, whereas Martinez favours ball-playing centrebacks. Those two jobs are very, very different- and if you have been developed from 14 years old to be one, switching to the other is not something that can be rushed. 

I feel that Martinez has done a very admirable job thus far in focusing development attention on the kids, and word coming out of the club is that there is finally a development ladder that allows the players coming through the academy to see a path to the first team (managed by Ol'Joe)- which is great for everyone.

I've already told you particularly about my background, but I'll just give you some of my current circumstances. As you may remember, I currently live in Sweden. My wife and I were forced to move because we could not find work in the UK. We both work for a large pharma company (so we're evil on that count) but we have both made significant contributions towards discoveries helping patients with asthma and diabetes. More and more people in our line of work are moving out of the UK, many to Germany, Switzerland and the USA. Quite the brain drain.

Should the UK leave the EU then we have to rely heavily on the goodwill of the Swedish government to provide us with visas. We're only on contracts unfortunately, not permanent employees. Now thankfully under current circumstances our respective contracts are pretty stable. However should we no longer be part of the EU we would have to move back to the UK. To unemployment, and possibly even homelessness. Sounds like hyperbole? Actually I wish it were. Currently we are undoubtedly better off here, but that would change should the UK exit.

Certainly Sweden is not the leftist socialist multiculti paradise that many people think it is. There are many problems that, like the UK, are often attributed to immigrants. As an immigrant myself, I am concerned by this. It's only the colour of my skin that prevents me being abused by the locals. That, and maybe my pissole efforts to speak Swedish. But there are other issues that cannot be blamed on Johnny Foreigner, but the ""Sweden Democrats"" (the Swedish equivalent of UKIP) choose, like a certain British counterpart I could mention, to ignore the root causes and just say that sending all these people back would solve all of Sweden's problems.

So yes, I'm biased. Yes, I feel that immigration has benefitted me and my wife, and I like having the freedom to take myself anywhere else in Europe should circumstances necessitate.

Whether or not your statement is true, stopping immigration is actually a bad thing. Even if by ""stopping immigration"" means in your mind ""well, just the unskilled migrants innit"" where do *you* in particular draw the line? Would I be a part of your anglo-saxon utopia?

This is why he is not being dropped: Ryan Mason is playing better than Dembele and Paulinho. He is also doing it with some effort, which has been sorely lacking in the other two. 

It is unfair to base your critique of him based on 5 games. 5 games which include Arsenal and City, plus two terrible games against Newcastle and Villa (Where arguably he was one of very few positives in both games).

The only colour change that generation sonic ever underwent was when it was given a blue wash for use in The Eleventh Hour (for some reason), but even so the difference is [minor](http://www.therpf.com/members/phez/albums/drwho/10719-vlcsnap-2012-01-16-10h11m06s98.png) to the point it takes a trained eye to notice it (it's possible that the colour change was due to the change in cinematography. 

Either way. Your point it moot.

Someone with a suitable degree or a job lined up should be allowed into the country. So long as they have sufficient education or a job I wouldn't assume the negative about that person. 

An unskilled migrant from abroad however would not qualify for entry to the country unless they had a job waiting them on entry.

Roy Hodgson has, definitively, met literally thousands of players.  He's coached 20 teams and played for 7 others over a 50 year career in multiple countries.  There is not a chance in hell he **hasn't** met a gay footballer.  Any right thinking response would be ""I haven't met any openly gay footballers, and that's a shame"".

&gt;As a gay man, I find this sort of 'campaigning' ridiculous - always looking for a story with a gay angle, just for the sake of it. Although, as one of the founders of Stonewall, it doesn't surprise me McKellen has thrown his toys out of the pram with this - much of their campaigning, especially in recent years, has been built around sensationalism and looking for problems in places where they might not exist.

This is absolutely absurd.  Are you seriously suggesting there isn't a problem with homophobia in football?

First, I normally would. It's polite and it doesn't *normally* hinder me in any way. That doesn't stop undertaking cars that are indicating to turn left being stupidly dangerous.

Second, it's a 4 way junction controlled by traffic lights. This means a **lot** of cyclists can pile up at peak times. I don't think you understand the number of bicycles that pile up at this location. If I needed to turn left I may have to wait until the lights change to stop the constant flow of cyclists. Meaning I'd stop the entire flow of traffic behind me trying to go left and forward. It'd be chaos.

Thirdly, I take rule 182 to be about coming from behind and cutting in front of them. Because that's usually what the definition of ""to cut in on"" someone means. In fact, [the definition in the dictionary](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/cut-in) of ""cut-in"" is ""pull in too closely in front of another vehicle after having overtaken it.""

If I'm ahead, then I still believe I have right of way. I could be mistaken, but I don't believe I am. Mostly because I believe that cyclists are also told to abide by the ""overtake on the right"" rule, with the exception of someone indicating to turn right. 

Furthermore, there's a **separate** rule stating not to cross anything passing in cycle lanes which would be unnecessary if cyclists were already in a lane of their own. So no, as a cyclist you're not automatically in your own lane of traffic. And if you believe so, you should probably look up the rules yourself.",0,1415043434,null,0,false,0,clrxxnc,t3_2l59hb,t1_clrxxnc,t1_clrvvdj,null,1426209971,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Which god is that, exactly?

So that includes the immigrants already living here? Or doesn't it? How about their kids? What if they have citizenship? What if they're asylum seekers?

&gt;So long as we apply the principles of democracy to running the country I see no wrong.

Democracy has it's limits. To use an exaggerated example, I'm sure you'd agree that if 51% of 'the people in general in the country' voted for the 'Let's Take All Of /u/joethepro36's Stuff Act (2014)' then that wouldn't be a good application of 'the principles of democracy'.

&gt;50k is a reasonable amount that is big enough to allow higher-end and higher skilled individuals into the country.

'Reasonable' according to which economist? And why should poor people from other countries have to stay there, in a nation stripped of everyone you think is 'high-end' and 'high-skilled'? Is that their 'god-given' right?

&gt;It's nice, round and easy to understand hence why its touted as the magic number.

So it's a policy for people who find numbers hard to understand?

&gt;According to [Eurostat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostat) 47.3 million people lived in the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) in 2010 who were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million), Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million).

&gt;To use an exaggerated example, I'm sure you'd agree that if 51% of 'the people in general in the country' voted for the 'Let's Take All Of /u/joethepro36's Stuff Act (2014)' then that wouldn't be a good application of 'the principles of democracy'.

It would be a perfect application of democracy. When the people make bad collective decisions they will suffer for it. I will not restrict democracy with an attitude that I know better than the people. The people must learn after making their own mistakes.

&gt;And why should poor people from other countries have to stay there, in a nation stripped of everyone you think is 'high-end' and 'high-skilled'? Is that their 'god-given' right?

Maybe if we didn't poach the skilled people from less developed countries the low skilled workers wouldn't bloody *need* to come here in the first place. You're basically saying ""oh we take in the high skill workers, so we need to take in everyone else too"". And what then do we do? Take in *everyone*, do we import whole countries of peoples into this country? Certainly not. I'd love to hear where you'd draw the line on immigration, our resources are finite after all.

&gt;So it's a policy for people who find numbers hard to understand? Forgive me for being a little suspicious of policies that are designed to be 'easy to understand' rather than, y'know 'moral' or 'effective'.

Sometimes you need to use abstractions to help represent complex issues. When posed with the question ""where do you draw the line?"" someone is far more likely to reply with an arbitrary number instead of complex political argument or an essay. I only say it's easy to understand because it is. Politicians these days tend to um and ah around issues, a straight answer such as ""immigration levels should be cut to around 50k a year"" is a better reply then ""well we need to consider x, y and z and the effects of each"" while not saying anything concrete.",0,1415044588,null,0,false,0,clryk8o,t3_2l3d9a,t1_clryk8o,t1_clrxxr3,null,1426209679,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1

It's 1.6. You are either terrible at rounding or trying to smear the stats in favor of your argument. That isn't a good look.

As for the passing completion, that's a product of the system of the team. Michael Cox explains it here in one of his pieces at the end of last season which focused on Poch's Southampton team.

&gt; ...in truth there’s only one side that is worth discussing in greater detail. That is Southampton, who bucked this trend by managing to record the highest average possession in the division (58.6%), despite only the ninth-highest pass completion rate (81.4%).

[Graph here](http://i.imgur.com/7CU1KbJ.jpg)

&gt; How have they managed this? Well, put simply, because possession statistics don’t simply show how effectively a side keeps the ball, they also take into account how quickly they win it back. Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino is, famously, a discipline of Marcelo Bielsa, the Argentine coach who puts a huge emphasis upon pressing, and winning the ball quickly.

And I would imagine his average key passes will continue to climb if he stays in the side against lesser teams. Considering 3 of the 5 league games he's played in have been against top four sides, chance creation stats will be minimized since he's playing in center midfield.",0,1415044657,null,0,false,0,clrylm5,t3_2l6hwk,t1_clrylm5,t1_clrxup4,null,1426209662,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

&gt;The campaign for equality should never be named after only one subset of the population. This kind of defeats the point, no?

When the inequality predominantly disadvantages one particular group, then the movement for equality is generally the movement for the advancement of that particular group.  

When it comes to feminism, the main problem that the movement formed to combat was the poor treatment of women in various contexts.  For instance, women in many contexts were denied employment opportunities that were available to men for no other real reason than their sex, or were evaluated according to gender-specific criteria such as their sexual attractiveness.  So at least initially, while the goal may have indeed been equal treatment for all, it was really only the women that needed the help.  

""Equalist"" now could be said to sometimes describe people who want to reverse some of the overshoot, where in some areas it at least appears that the group originally victimized by discrimination now seems to benefit more from the affirmative actions taken in their benefit.  Perhaps now there are many situations in which women now have an unfair advantage over men, such as in jobs in certain industries or in admission to certain schools.  There are also certain social advantages, such as being generally the gatekeepers of sex, or being more frequently the recipient of favors and gifts, or of being able to use sex manipulatively and not be condemned for it.  

Theoretically, in a truly equal society those advantages would also be erased.  So quite often, people who claim to be ""equalist"" instead of ""feminist"" are more interested in erasing *those* advantages, and therefore might really be just masking misogyny under the guise of progressive values.

People broadly accept limits to their autonomy so that they can exist within communities. Why shouldn't countries do the same? Why should people from other countries have to bow to our will that they remain poor or persecuted in their own countries?

&gt;While I am only weakly religious, I do not like the idea of shying away from ""god-given"" rights. Our political rights come to us from birth, they are not given by a government or human entity. They are integral to our own humanity. So for lack of a better word, I will use the phrase ""god-given rights"".

'Natural rights' is the phrase you're looking for.

&gt;Our political rights come to us from birth, they are not given by a government or human entity.

You think the government doesn't have to give you the right to vote? You're conflating the rights of nationa with the rights of individuals, *and then *you're conflating human rights with civil liberties. The former are generally agreed to be inalienable while the latter are not.

&gt;It includes all residents of the UK, everyone who lives here.

So this includes immigrants? I just want some clarification here.

&gt;The foundations of democracy are based on an absolute, that the people of a country have the right to choose the way that it is run.

So the rights of the majority always take precedence over the rights of minorities? We had this argument the other day, didn't we? What if the majority of people voted to protect minorities constitutionally, then the majority of people voted to persecute a minority in a plebiscite? Should we listen to the will of the people as expressed in the constitution or the will of the people as expressed in the plebiscite? And what happens to the minority's 'right to choose the way [their country] is run' in this circumstance?

&gt;It would be a perfect application of democracy. When the people make bad collective decisions they will suffer for it.

Shit, that's convenient! I mean, except for you, because now we've got your stuff.

&gt;Maybe if we didn't poach the skilled people from less developed countries the low skilled workers wouldn't bloody need to come here in the first place. 

This is your position, not mine.

&gt;You're basically saying ""oh we take in the high skill workers, so we need to take in everyone else too"". 

I haven't said that. I've said that if we want free trade and freedom of movement for capital it's inhuman to prevent other people from following the goods and the capital.

&gt;Take in everyone, do we import whole countries of peoples into this country?

This isn't happening and there's no reason to think it would, anymore than to think that everyone in this country will leave it to move to a wealthier nation.

&gt;I'd love to hear where you'd draw the line on immigration, our resources are finite after all.

We are nowhere close to exhausting any of the resources that we can't import from other countries. If our resources actually were limited in the sense you suggest, there'd be no reason for people to immigrate here. This is really 'Read the blurb of an economics text book' stuff.

&gt;Sometimes you need to use abstractions to help represent complex issues. When posed with the question ""where do you draw the line?"" someone is far more likely to reply with an arbitrary number instead of complex political argument or an essay. I only say it's easy to understand because it is. Politicians these days tend to um and ah around issues, a straight answer such as ""immigration levels should be cut to around 50k a year"" is a better reply then ""well we need to consider x, y and z and the effects of each"" while not saying anything concrete.

You seem to be leaving out option number three, which is 'Say something concrete that actually makes sense even if it's a little complex'.

false,Growlbot_,lfc87,,"On paper, he's right. We have a starting defence worth about £50m combined. Quite a few of the goals I've seen us concede have been sloppy mistakes born from our tactics. Moreno and Manquillo are useful and I think Skrtel/Sakho and Lovren will eventually settle into something fairly resilient. They aren't helped by the style we play of fast paced counter that include the full-backs, risks taken and the centre-backs being asked to begin and dictate passing moves. Rodgers leaves them exposed for quite a large part of matches and the constant rotation hasn't helped. I don't know what the three at the back was about vs Newcastle. An attacking mentality had great success last season, but it came with the drawback that our defence would sometimes look like clowns at a circus trying to deal with chaos at the back. They are the breaks.

The other issue is Gerrard, or the deep-lyer. Asking a primarily attack-minded midfielder to get involved defensively causes problems with who deals with danger. I feel like removing Gerrard from this role, in fact removing a deep-lying mid from the line-up might beef up our midfield and allow the defenders to take control and responsibility of their territory better. Maybe they are being babysat with a defensive midfielder sat on their toes and they'd be better off without it? Or perhaps we'd concede 5 per match instead?

The main complaints I hear are that

A) They tend to be the same shit repetitive jokes over and over, for example.

""Ukip represents the opportunity to have the Nazis back without style"" - Frankie Boyle

How many (ridiculous) nazi comparisons and accusations of racism are we supposed to hear before we get bored? Maybe hating UKIP makes these jokes feel more original, but I don't see how.

B) I have yet to see the amount of mocking of left-wing parties like Labour or the Greens that UKIP or even the Conservatives get. (please spare me the argument about Labour not being on the left)

Just watch these videos.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhU95XXUOzQ

Count the amount of UKIP jokes compared to jokes about other parties.

And then Russell Howard utterly misrepresenting UKIP by saying they ""have no policies"", and then listing off some comments made by members (often Ex members) as if they're policy. Which one is it Howard?

false,Qxzkjp,null,null,"It really, really annoys me to see people talking as if a change in gender is just a change in appearance. Do none of you know any transgender people? Gender identity is a huge part of a person's sense of self, and changing it makes for a substantially different character, in a way that changing hair colour or height or even race wouldn't.

I can sort of deal with it happening to a side character like the master without it being addressed, especially because he's so fucked in the head anyway that gender dysphoria would be the least of his ills. But if the main character of the show changes gender, you're either going to have to deal with actually addressing the issue of gender dysphoria (which I'm not in principle against as a thematic element, but it's a huge character change).

Or you're going to have to deal with the fact that a fundamental part of the character's identity has just been completely inverted. Not a minor, peripheral part like whether they like apples, but a major, foundational aspect of who they are. You can't just have the person go ""oh look at that, I'm an innie now!"" They'll change pronouns, something which if there is any believability to the show will be screwed up by others occasionally. People who knew her as him will take time adjusting to the fact that she's now a she. It's going to have all of the life-altering depth as when a real-life transgender person comes out, but with the added complication that the person has been actually and radically altered, and not just decided to openly express what they felt deep down from the start.

Gender transition is a big, socially important, and complex topic, and not something that should be glossed over or trivialised. I would love to see it addressed in a child-accessible way by a side character, someone who was written to be a tactfully handled exposition of a difficult topic. I do not want it tacked onto a main character as a minor side note just to satisfy some fans' desire to have a female doctor.

A CM's job isn't to score. Create plays is one, which hes doing. Assists mean fuck all, it's his first season in a big league at 22 years old where most players are much, much bigger than him. He's playing his heart out, which is what you want. He's playing well doing it, if Paulinho would play his hardest day in, day out yeah we'd start him. Poch likes Mason better though and so do most supporters. He has the tackling, the pass percentage, his heat map is probably way better than Paulinho's if I ever found that kind of comparision. So would you start Paulinho over Modrić? Because he didn't have a hell of a lot of goals either whilst playing for us. He has the tackling, the passing, everything we needed out of a CM. Don't forget the effort because I mean, he needed to at least try his hardest to attract Madrid. 

It's so frustrating trying to explain to you why Mason is getting it over Paulinho. Mason is doing his job, Paulinho lacks his defensive responsibilities, maybe not his offensive but definitely his defensive. He's a Box to half line kind of guy. 

I'd play Townsend more often if he would convert his England form to club, something he has had difficulty doing. But Lamela and his strengths requires a whole other argument trying to explain.

Bollocks? Anyone able to verify this? I'm not an expert, but the following points are making me doubt this:

Firstly, Magnox reactors were fueled with unenriched Uranium, which does not react violently enough with the air to explode. 

Secondly, water is a neutron moderator. If anything, the draining of the water in the pools would absolutely inhibit any possibility of the fuel reaching criticality because the neutrons would never reach thermal speeds. 

Granted, there will be a lot of sludge and shit in those ponds, full of secondary products of fission which could be very bad for a water table or an ecosystem, but the talk of explosion seems like hyperbole to me.

2 possibilities for why she wears red. A. She likes red. B. She's the personification of the red settings (whatever that means).

A requires basically no justification or explanation past itself. She likes red, it's that simple. Not all of her clothes are red, but a lot of them are.

B, on the other hand, requires flat-out ignoring some of the plot points that were handed to us (like the psychic saying Clara was ""just an ordinary normal girl""), as well as going all the way back to an episode long before we even knew she existed, taking a piece of throw-away dialogue, and finding some way to twist and mould it until the theory makes sense.

""Last Week Tonight"" seemed to have been born out of The Colbert Report (which itself is a spin-off of The Daily Show). The Colbert Report was a superbly observed piss-take of right wing, loud-mouth talking heads, like ""Papa Bear"" Bill O'Reilly, and über-paranoid crud that comes out of Fox News. Colbert satarised their lunacy, and it worked. On top of that, Colbert (and Jon Stewart, and now John Oliver) really do make some interesting journalistic points.

John Oliver was the ""British corespondent"" on The Daily Show, where things really got going for him. I suspect that's how he managed to land his own show.

It's the utter bare-faced pomposity of those being satarised that make it work.

In the UK, we don't have the same news culture. While we do have a vast amount of crap, we don't have the same ""personality"" news readers as they do over Stateside. Our news is, generally, seen to be more impartial. Particularly TV news. (though things are changing with the BBC, sadly, but that's for another day.)

We just don't have the same personalities to satarise, so I don't think it'd transfer. HIGNIFY is probably the best example of satire programming in the UK, and that is much tamer than it used to be.

Anyway, we're up to our eyeballs in generic panel shows now. ",0,1415050154,null,0,false,0,cls1ofc,t3_2l6ls5,t1_cls1ofc,t3_2l6ls5,null,1426208226,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

This is pointed out because it's something you should always be doing. It's **not** an allowance for cyclists to undertake your car. That's like saying that the statement ""watch out for pickpockets"" means that you're allowed to pickpocket people!

It's not a second lane of traffic if there' isn't a cycle lane. You should probably treat it like there is for safety, but that's not an allowance for cyclists to undertake.

On a normal road I doubt they'd even try to undertake. The problem is that because it's a light controlled junction they naturally pull up next to other cars.

A good cyclists wouldn't be undertaking a car that's signalling to turn left (unless they were in a designated cycle lane). Which was my original point.",0,1415051885,null,0,false,0,cls2n2j,t3_2l59hb,t1_cls2n2j,t1_clrzvy9,null,1426207776,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The fact of the matter is that when he starts he adds almost nothing going forward, I'd go as far as to say that he detracts from our positive play with backward passing and sloppy control. So surely he has to make up for it with good defensive work? If I had more time I'd find the stats I saw the other week, but nevertheless they are out there, and give me good reason to believe that his tackle success/interceptions/clearances are incredibly poor for his position against the average from the rest of the league, not to mention his vision, range and dribbling skills are almost non-existent.

I had hoped that with Matic arriving - who may I add is one a completely different plane to Mikel in terms of passing, dribbling and tackling - people would realise how a world-class defensive player should really play, but it would appear that through contradictory logic and blind sentiment people love settling for something (or should I say someone) a lot less.

It was also a major reason why Canada and the US were able to record budget surpluses during the end of the 90s because of budget cuts and their leaders convincing their central bank heads to expand the monetary base.

Then you have cases like in the PIGGS where monetary policy is tight due to them not having an independent central bank and monetary policy under the authority of the ECB. As well as using the euro.

Which resulted in cuts but lackluster monetary expansion leading to no softening from the budget cuts.

An independent central bank that has the ability to control its own monetary policy requires having an own domestic currency. And many people who backed adopting the euro have gone really really quite as of late....

If Gerrard is sat out for the match or a portion of the match, I will venture a guess that Rodgers will use a 4-3-3 and have Henderson, Coutinho, and Lucas/Allen in the midfield with Sterling and Lallana out wide and Balotelli as the lone striker. 

But if he decides with the 4-1-2-1-2; I can see Lucas at the DM role, Henderson and Coutinho/Lallana/Allen as the CMs, Sterling at the top, and Balotelli and Borini as the two strikers.

Edit- Added Lucas to the line ups. Had forgotten about him. Thanks to /u/Richiematt262 for reminding me.

Well, the Government spends about £100bn on the NHS each year, and about half of this goes on staff wages. Meanwhile, annual spending on MPs salaries is about £50m.

Total MP pay is roughly 0.1% the size of total NHS pay, so raising the MPs' pay by 10% would cost as much as raising the NHS pay by 0.01%. Conversely, raising the NHS pay by 1% would be equivalent to raising the MPs' pay tenfold.

That's the basic maths. Of course the reasons for the pay rise are more involved: the battle of wages against inflation, and the compensation that should be required to work in government or for public healthcare.

It's perfectly reasonably to have concerns about European immigration but it's not reasonable to use people's fear and credulity to get them to vote for you - if a person has formed their political opinion (however valid that opinion may be) because they've been persuaded by UKIPs fear-mongering and misleading statistics and headlines that appeal to credulity and ignorance of the facts not not because they've actually thought for themselves then there's no real reason why we should have to take that person seriously. 

There are probably people within UKIP who came to their ""anti-immigration views"" independent of the current populist movement - polling seems to suggest that those people represent about 3-5% of the population. But there are many people who are happy to say nasty things and believe easy excuses provided everyone else believes them too - that is the worst side of populism in a nut shell: scapegoating, demagoguery and conspiracism. It doesn't deserve to be treated with respect. 

TL;DR - there's a big difference between having concerns about immigration and being a UKIP supporter. I consider the latter to be considerably worse than the former. ",0,1415053935,null,0,false,0,cls3qre,t3_2l6563,t1_cls3qre,t1_clrwugp,null,1426207262,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

They mention that she started hearing the voices around the time her sister disappeared, and she was put on medication because they believed that the disappearance of her sister made her crack and start hearing voices. When the Doctor revealed that the voices she heard were real,  that proved she wasn't crazy and storywise, that connected her sister's disappearance to the creatures. When the creatures retreated and made the foliage disappear, they returned her sister. Or something like that.

That's what I took away from it anyway, it's entirely possible I'm reading into it too much and it's like you said, magic sister out of nowhere.

It does appear to be fairly subconscious... When 9 regenerated to 10, he clearly felt younger and became a younger man...

Maybe there's a point where either he won't be in control (ie: a specific regeneration is forced on him, as happened with 2 when the Time Lords imposed 3 on him) or he just decides it's time for a change and (for once) changes manually (using the same tech Romana did since that should still be in the TARDIS somewhere).
