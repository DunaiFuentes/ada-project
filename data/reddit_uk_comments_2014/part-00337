The police traced the package and discovered that under the pseudonym ""Peter Henderson"", Hayman had used an apartment in Bayswater, London, to conduct obscene correspondence. In the apartment, police found 45 diaries describing six years of ""sexual fantasies"" concerning children and activities with prostitutes, articles of female clothing and obscene literature. He was investigated by police but released without charge after being given a warning not to send obscene material through the mail. In 1981, Private Eye magazine revealed this event. Then, using parliamentary privilege, MP Geoffrey Dickens asked why Hayman had not been prosecuted. The Attorney General's reply indicated that while Hayman had been found to have received pornographic material through the post, it was not of an extreme nature, was non-commercial and in a sealed envelope, so did not warrant prosecution"".

I first took a liking to Chelsea about four years ago after the 2010 World Cup, which was my first meaningful experience with this amazing sport. I really enjoyed watching Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba and was interested to find that they played for the same club team. I started at university that fall and made a friend who was a massive Arsenal fan. He tried to win me to his side, and I'll admit I was tempted as they do have an impressive history of success, etc., but a combination of the Chelsea badge/iconography/colors, history, nouveau-riche imagery, and the sense that our club is viewed as upstarts, giving us this ""us against the world"" mentality, was really appealing. 

My love for the club was fully cemented when I studied at Kingston University, about 20 minutes from Stamford Bridge. Being so close to my club and having the opportunity not only to see them in action (a 6-1 win over Nordsjaelland in the Champions League) but to later take a tour of the stadium really gave me a new level of love and appreciation for Chelsea. I was able to spend a full season in London, experiencing the thrill of a Premier League campaign firsthand, and getting to enjoy the highs and lows of that season (2012-13) just a quick train ride from the center of my footballing universe. I've surely romanticized it in my memory, but it was still magic.

I mean, if that kills the show for you then of course stop watching. But Doctor Who has always had a white male protagonist at its heart, the show can hardly be accused of giving white male heroes insufficient screen time. And most of them have been glorious Doctors, but it seems pointlessly limiting to restrict all future possible Doctors to the same prototype.

And yes, if the original premise were pitched today it would probably have a hard time being picked up. It was a long shot in 1962 too, and times and tastes have changed. Part of the show's genius is its capacity for constant re-invention. The Doctor becomes a different person again and again, companions come and go, and the show changes and grows with the audience. If it hadn't, it wouldn't still be on the air.

I mean it's possible there are left of centre people in the Conservative party but then what the hell are they doing in the Conservative party? Similarly there may be non-racists in the BNP but then what the hell are they doing in the BNP, a party which openly expresses disgust towards immigrants and seeks to use the state to discriminate between races. Even it's own membership is limited specifically to one race only. 

If some of the the British people express support for a disruptive policy (like pushing people to repatriate themselves) that expressly intends to be discriminatory on the basis of race and no other factor then I don't think it's at all hard or controversial to call those people bigoted and in favour of racial discrimination - at base it's merely a statement of fact that these people want discrimination, it's not a lazy generalisation.

Bang in the centre, the prices are £200 upwards per month. Nicer offices don't always mean higher rent, it's more the location that decides the price. Queen's Square and Broadmead tend to be the most expensive, followed by Temple Meads/Quay and the more affordable ones are on the outskirts of the city such as Aztec West (Which is really quite remote so I wouldn't personally go for it)

I think we all overlooked how massive of a hole Suarez would leave, as there are examples of clubs being able to cope very well without star players like that in their side. I think what we see now is that confidence is very, very important to a side's performance, and that Suarez and Sturridge are absolutely vital to and perfect for the Liverpool system. 

We've always defended via offense under BR--whether it be outscoring opponents or possessing the ball so often they have only a few chances. Without the potent offense, our defense is under a lot of pressure. It's hard to find defenders who have the confidence, athleticism, intelligence and poise to play the ball out of the back as well as be lockdown defenders. Unfortunately, we are not at the point where we can attract the type of defenders that can single-handedly save points. Don't get me wrong, I very highly rate Sakho and think Skrtel and Lovren will end being fine for Liverpool (Skrtel has been making crippling mistakes for us for years now, along with some top notch defending, so I'm not sure why Lovren gets no patience on that front, but that's another discussion). But at the moment, we need the confidence and potency in attack in order to perform well everywhere.

Pelle and Tadic definitely were well established players, please man, be realistic. ""The fact that Pelle is 29 means he isn't going to stay in this form for long,"" that doesn't make any sense I'm afraid - Pelle is 29 but he is quite clearly in the prime of his career, a lot of strikers play there best around that age, 26-30 say, or in the case of a player like Ibrahimovic, even longer. As it stands, Pelle has been banging them in for Southampton this season and him and Tadic have formed quite a formidable link - I saw a post-match interview with the two of them recently where they said that they were delighted to have the opportunity to play together because they thought themselves, and others thought, that they would link up really well together.

I have recently said in a comment that I'm almost positive that Southampton's form will not hold up for too much longer. I think they will finish 7th or even 8th maybe, their next 10 games are going to be tough, I can't remember off the top of my head but they have Arsenal twice, United twice, Chelsea and City to play I THINK. So we're going to see the real Southampton under Koeman in the coming weeks/months.

Alfonso Alves is different in my opinion, he had only had one really great season in Holland I think and (I had to check this), he was playing in Sweden before hand. Now I think that the gulf in quality between the Eredivisie and the Swedish top division is much more defined than that between the Eredivisie and the Premiership. There are some really strong sides in the Eredivisie and I would imagine that the quality of coaching is extremely good in Holland, much better than that in Sweden anyway. I think some of the weaker, well maybe mid table, Eredivisie sides could interchange with the weaker teams in the Premiership and perform similarly, if not better, than them.

Also, I hate that we signed Rickie Lambert.  It's just such a joke, it makes me feel like we think of ourselves as a small club.  It's madness, Lambert is a 32 yr old below average player; he offers no relief and certainly isn't a match winner subbed on in the dying moments.  Chelsea get drogba, City get Lampard we get Lambert. Pathetic.

I still believe in Balotelli and I think he has the potential to be world class but Rodgers needs to stop talking about him like he's a total liability, this is his last chance, we're waiting for him to score goals etc... Good lord, literally just making him feel like such a loser; following Suarez is pressure enough.

I think it would be slightly disingenuous to suggest there are not people who are against immigration because they are racist. I disagree that this needs to be an accusation directed against anybody who opposes mass migration.

It's a commonly expressed, widely held and understandable position held by a large number of policy makers, probably openly expressed by a majority and agreed with in principle by the rest

It's not a view supported by a single mainstream political party. You are deceiving yourself if you believe the green party or the labour party are opposed to White British people becoming a minority. They actively support immigration policies that would ensure this. There are politicians and commentators who may believe this, but they reserve their criticism of mass migration for concern of the national culture and integration.

A woman's testimony is worth half that of a man's right? Women have to cover up and men do not. Men can have multiple wives and women are not allowed multiple husbands. Women are described as 'deficient in intelligence'. There's a whole load of stuff here

http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islam_and_Women

&gt; No! It's down to the individuals. Seeing as one of my best female friends came from a Muslim family, I know for a fact they aren't misogynist.

People are actually not misogynist by default. In a secular country good people who are Muslims just ignore the morally abhorrent parts of their religion. 

So does Islam get off? No it doesn't. Women get screwed over inheritance (they get half what a man gets). They get screwed over domestic violence.  

Even worse in the UK's Shariah courts this happens too. Now you'll say ""but those are only voluntary"". However in a community with a problem with domestic violence is it really voluntary? It's easy to see women getting pressured into going to a court 'as good Muslims' where they get a worse deal.

And then there's Islam and homosexuality. Not a single UK Muslim said that homosexuality was acceptable. 

http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality

You have to separate your friend and her family who I'm sure are great and what the religion actually says. And also bear in mind that if Shariah were in force your friend and her family would not be the ones deciding on what gets enforced.

In a real Islamic state - e.g. the Taliban or ISIS it's even worse. Non Muslim women can be enslaved. Apostates can be killed and in almost every country where Muslims are the majority that happens. Women get punished for reporting a rape in Pakistan, Afghanistan and most of the Middle East - if they can't provide four male witnesses they are prosecuted for adultery. Hands are cut off. People are stoned or crucified. 

What you're doing is saying that Islam is OK because you know one family of Muslims living in a non Islamic state who are OK. For all you know they're only nominally Muslim anyway. They can do that because they don't live in an Islamic state or a state where Sharia is the basis of law.

As in, all his stories are cleaning up all the mysteries about doctor who (with not so good logic) and his adventures are taking a back seat.  For example, a lot of the episodes (when the new doctor who came out in 2005) back in the day were just the doctor and his companion going somewhere on a whim and ending up having to save the day/fight something. Eventually a seasonal story arch would show up and they'd have to deal with it.

No it didn't. Give me a nation that practiced self determination **before** being incorporated into the British Empire? Democracy as we know it didn't exist anywhere in the world up until the late 1800's, universal suffrage not until 1918 (here). Do you really believe the Mughals were holding referendums to decide government policy, rather than you know, being ruled by an absolute monarch? In all cases it was one set of elites replacing another (or to be more accurate one set of elites pledging fealty to a stronger set of elites - local forms of government were almost always left in place as long as they toed the line).

The British Empire largely disintegrated in the 1940's/50's and one of the key things a colony had to have before being allowed to leave was a democratic system. Rhodesia's declaration of independence for example was not recognized because the white minority refused the black majority the right to participate in elections.

Can you explain? I'm really struggling to think of anywhere denied the right to self determination 'to this day'. The most recent example i can think of is the islanders of the Indian Ocean Territory which were evicted (to our shame) to make way for a leased US naval base in the 60's.

It's clear he doesn't want to ""kill the jew"". You're clearly laughing AT him, not with him. His Ali G stupidity is not anti-intellectualism, it's actually a cleverly crafted highlighting of cultural differences. Old people are so out of touch with the young they believe he's real. No one would act like Ali G other than to parody.

Dapper getting his fan base to be highly abusive to people online doesn't seem to sit so well with the image he's created. Approaching women in the street and saying ""5 of you one of me lets get it on girls"" is also crossing a line. There's nothing under the joke about homeless people ""smelling like shit"". It's just boorish. All you end up with is a guy being offensive and 'that's the joke'. His fan base seem to feel it's legitimising the behaviour too - as can be heard by the comments his audience make. 

Plus he's got one joke about the size of his cock that's repeated a bit too much. Personally I think he'll disappear soon, I don't agree on banning him.

I can't speak for his time at Sociedad, but overall I would say Illara is still kind of raw, and I've never seen him play with consistency (then again, he hasn't really had the chance). He has had good, solid games where a lot of the midfield passing goes through him, but then he has also had poor performances, usually in bigger games (see @Dortmund 2nd leg last season). 

He's not the type of player that would turn everything around for us if we hypothetically signed him in January, he has always had a top midfield around him at Madrid to help him (Modric, Di Maria, Alonso, Khedira). I see him kind of as a more defensive Emre Can, where you can clearly see the talent and upside but he's not quite ready to take the midfield on his shoulders.

Isco, on the other hand, would slot right into our team and improve us immediately. But I feel our window to snatch him up may have just passed.

This is a quote (thats not taken out of context), from his New Statesman article, written by him:

&gt; I feel it is a far more potent political act to completely renounce the current paradigm than to participate in even the most trivial and tokenistic manner, by obediently X-ing a little box.  Billy Connolly said: “Don’t vote, it encourages them,”

and

&gt; I've never voted and never will

Later in the same article he says

&gt;Who am I to argue with The Great Trickster Connolly? I will never vote and I don’t think you should, either.

That's telling people quite clearly NOT to vote. Why are his fans so reluctant to address this?

&gt; He has been extremely clear in saying voting does work

He's been very clear in saying he 'will never vote'. He only started to say this AFTER he was slammed in the press. He even lied and said ""that's not what I meant"". If it's not what he meant he's delusional.

His last interview on radio he said: 

&gt;""I never said I wouldn't vote"" (a definite lie) ""but that if there's someone to vote for then you should, vote green, I dunno"".

**Price of product:** £8.50

**Where did you purchase:** Boots

**Product claims:** ""Eucerin DermatoCLEAN Mild Cleansing Milk is a rich, creamy lotion that: removes make-up, helps skin to breathe, has been tested on, and proven to be compatible with, sensitive skin, is particularly nourishing for dry and sensitive skin.Skin is better prepared to absorb care product. Skin feels clean and soothed and is noticeably soft and supple It contains an innovative combination of active ingredients:
* APG Complex: an effective yet extra mild cleansing complex
* Gluco-glycerol: a nature-derived moisturising active
* Hyaluronic acid: skin care active with a high moisture binding capacity""

**About you:** Dry to normal skin, can be a bit sensitive (I think to fragrance) loathes foaming cleansers. Occasional individual zits that like to leave red marks (though not PIE) or PIH which fortunately fades quite quickly.

**Your opinion:** This is has the texture/viscosity of single cream, so it's not properly runny like milk. IMHO, this makes it easier to apply. I use this after an oil cleanser, so can't comment on how well it removes makeup and sunscreen, but it makes for a very nice second cleanse. I'll definitely use it up, but probably won't buy it again because Superdrug Vitamin E hot cloth cleanser is just as good and is £3.50 cheaper. I really like this has no fragrance, alcohol, colouring or anionic surfactants. If you have genuinely sensitive or eczematous skin, this is a good option.

I'd like my employer to recognise the work I do and pay me the same my colleagues doing the same work, with similar levels of experience, get.

I'd like to be able to afford to buy presents for Christmas for my family that's more than just finding something for £4 on the market or getting my brother and sister to pay for yarn so I can make my mum a blanket from all three of us.

Where the cables connect to the pylon insulators, there are metal ""horns"" which allow the lightning to jump across from the cable into the pylon. This prevents it from overloading or damaging grid equipment. Damage can still occur, but it's pretty uncommon.

Overground pylon lines are cheap to build, but less reliable as they can be damaged by high winds or ice storms. They are also cheaper and easier to maintain. Faults can be found in hours, and often repaired within 24 hours.

Underground cables are more reliable, but suffer from a number of problems: much more expensive to install. Difficult and expensive to find faults. Regular underground vaults with access for cable joints are needed every few miles. Diagnosis and repair of a cable fault can be very expensive and can take months. Problems with voltage stability can also occur and may need compensating equipment.

Cooling is also an issue. Pylons are air cooled, and wind really helps. Because they are pure metal, it may be possible to temporarily overload them, in case of a power emergency (*). Soil acts like an insulator, so buried cables have problems with heat build up, so emergency overload usually isn't an option.

(*) For interest, this wind cooling effect is used for the power lines for a number of wind farms. The pylons are equipped with wind meters, and transmit data to HQ, where a computer model calculates the power line temperature and safe overload capacity. As the cooling effect is correlated with the wind farm output, it's possible to squeeze a lot more wind energy down the line that would otherwise be possible.",0,1415649634,null,0,false,0,clyo7ge,t3_2luucf,t1_clyo7ge,t1_clykcmq,null,1426092246,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"What about UKIP for gods sake? The party and it's aggressive supporters have been assuring us for a year at least that it's a mainstream political party and considering it's polling and considering that by Nov 20th it will probably it will have 2 MPs with more to follow at the GE it probably is; it's certainly way beyond the Green Party which you mention. 

Half the Conservative party is rabidly anti-Europe and anti-immigration and would join UKIP if they thought they could win in their seats. They are what's pushing Cameron to the right. I don't think any party leader would say that their goal is to make British people a minority - do you really honestly think they would survive as a party leader after making a comment like that? If they reject that yes/no question then can you not say they support the opposite?

The party leaders don't tend to talk in terms of 'ethicity' and 'White British' because, as I'm surprised you can't see, it sounds incredibly old fashioned and tends to give away the excessive race consciousness of typical prejudice. Normally only bigoted people count people up by their race like that - if you're concerned about immigration in general there's no reason you would count up the number of white's in your area compared to the number of blacks compared to others as you seem to be suggesting politicians do. For the purposes of prospective immigration planning the only reason you would single out individual races like black, asian or, for that matter, 'White British' as you do, is because you think it matters what race they are (not simply that they are an immigrant) which would at least indicate the quite obvious racist position of applying characteristics (usually negative and insulting) to racial genetics. They may not actually believe that but it sounds like they do. 

Politicians avoid using ethnicity terms, singling out races and words like minority because they are negative and unnecessary. Why say ""There are far to many blacks and asians in this country and their drowning out the white race"" when you could say ""We should have more controls on non-EU immigration"" - in practice they achieve the exact same thing but one certainly has more racist connotations merely in the language used. Politicians opt for the latter because they want to avoid the unnecessarily provocative language of the former. So no politician from the main 3 parties would use the words ""limit immigration to prevent the White British from becoming an ethnic minority"" but that doesn't mean they wouldn't do the same in practice using more sensible words. Theresa May's pledge to reduce immigration to the 10's of 1000s was basically in practice a pledge to reduce non-EU mostly non-white migration (given it makes up the bulk of our immigration) but describing it as such is just provocative because she's not reducing non-white immigration because their not white but because she's seeking to limit cultural change in specific communities and economic pressures so it makes no sense to talk about 'white British' or ethnic minorities unless you intend yourself to be associated with those kind of racists overtones - the BNP is very happy to be associated with those racist ideas because, surprise surprise, their voters think that way so it keeps using that language. 

EDIT: Also your focus on White British seems to give away prejudice of your own. If we got rid of 100% of the immigrants that have settled here in the last 100 years this country would not be 100% White British. There are plenty of non-White British citizens who have just as much a right to the opinions you hold and just as much right to claim 'ownership' of the country you want to socially engineer as you do.

Sure we've had some dodgy seasons in the last 5 years, but we've had some pretty close title run ins in the last 10. With the exception of 2007/2008 when they were 4 points off the title in 3rd, Arsenal have finished pretty much every season in the last 10 years in 4th and with at least a 10 point gap to 1st. Heck, even in our shitty seasons lately we've usually been closer to Arsenal than they were to the eventual champions. 

I never said they were a badly run club, but at the same time I'd be getting tired if I were an Arsenal supporter that the club seem content with finishing 4th pretty much every year and never making a step up to sign players who might get them the title. If they feel they can't sign more than 3 players in a single window then that might be a cause. It's impressive they've been as consistent as they have, but constantly being 4th and miles off a title challenge, going out in the middle stages of the CL every year and one trophy in ten years isn't really striking of ambition or success as a club.

As I said - I've raised it several times and never got a response. Did you read what I wrote? I did say it more than once.

&gt; It's easy to take quotes out of context,

It's not out of context - I even said go read the article - his article he wrote it. No where is that in ANY way out of context whatsoever. It's fully framed. It's his absolute message. 

How do you take a paragraph clearly saying 'do not engage in any tiny way, at all, whatsoever' as 'out of context'? Does he go on to say ""but if there's a viable option? No? Does he say ""don't vote just for the moment!""? No. Go goes on to say ""I don't vote and I don't think you should either"".

He message to follow it up on TV was ""Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending""?

&gt; he was recently called out by John Lydon 

And Polly Toinbee and Sam Gyimah and Robert Webb and David Blunkett and Nick Clegg... then guess what.. he changed it to ""I never said don't vote"". You appear to be unaware of the backlash.

&gt;gave a very clear response through his YouTube channel.

But you've not even read my post. As I said his original message was ""don't vote"" and ""I will never vote"". The very title of that piece is ""I'm not saying don't vote"".

I'm slightly amazed that you have not even read his New Statesman piece or watched his interviews but you'll link to a You Tube video as a response.

Can you only regurgitate his argument after he's fed it to you?

Edit: You linked to the Independent article - did you read the line

Do not associate the UK with a man who chokes women around the world as part of his pick up game. Please help us stand with the women of Australia, the women of America, and women everywhere, and do not let the UK play host to events where men are being taught how to violate and harass women.  It's not only women who are affected; Blanc's misogynistic 'pick up techniques' directly exploit vulnerable men who buy into rape culture and end up believing that this is an appropriate way to behave.

To allow this man into the UK legitimises sexual assault and predation, and sends a message that women are playthings or objects without agency.

Australia has already taken a stand by revoking his visa, let us demonstrate that we feel the same way about his message.

He is not just doing this in Tokyo. He is doing this all around the world. He is doing this in Denmark and Sydney. A likely outcome of his seminars in the UK would be increased incidence of sexual assault, already at staggering numbers.

What about them?

&gt;The party and it's aggressive supporters have been assuring us for a year at least that it's a mainstream political party and considering it's polling and considering that by Nov 20th it will probably it will have 2 MPs with more to follow at the GE it probably is; it's certainly way beyond the Green Party which you mention. 

Right, what about UKIP? If you're going to type out a wall of text, at least make a point.

&gt;Half the Conservative party is rabidly anti-Europe and anti-immigration and would join UKIP if they thought they could win in their seats. They are what's pushing Cameron to the right. I don't think any party leader would say that their goal is to make British people a minority - do you really honestly think they would survive as a party leader after making a comment like that? **If they reject that yes/no question then can you not say they support the opposite?**

None of this makes sense. What the fuck are you even talking about? 

&gt;The party leaders don't tend to talk in terms of 'ethicity' and 'White British' because, as I'm surprised you can't see, it sounds incredibly old fashioned and tends to give away the excessive race consciousness of typical prejudice. Normally only bigoted people count people up by their race like that - if you're concerned about immigration in general there's no reason you would count up the number of white's in your area compared to the number of blacks compared to others as you seem to be suggesting politicians do. For the purposes of prospective immigration planning the only reason you would single out individual races like black, asian or, for that matter, 'White British' as you do, is because you think it matters what race they are (not simply that they are an immigrant) which would at least indicate the quite obvious racist position of applying characteristics (usually negative and insulting) to racial genetics. They may not actually believe that but it sounds like they do. Politicians avoid using ethnicity terms, singling out races and words like minority because they are negative and unnecessary. Why say ""There are far to many blacks and asians in this country and their drowning out the white race"" when you could say ""We should have more controls on non-EU immigration"" - in practice they achieve the exact same thing but one certainly has more racist connotations merely in the language used. Politicians opt for the latter because they want to avoid the unnecessarily provocative language of the former. So no politician from the main 3 parties would use the words ""limit immigration to prevent the White British from becoming an ethnic minority"" but that doesn't mean they wouldn't do the same in practice using more sensible words. Theresa May's pledge to reduce immigration to the 10's of 1000s was basically in practice a pledge to reduce non-EU mostly non-white migration (given it makes up the bulk of our immigration) but describing it as such is just provocative because she's not reducing non-white immigration because their not white but because she's seeking to limit cultural change in specific communities and economic pressures so it makes no sense to talk about 'white British' or ethnic minorities unless you intend yourself to be associated with those kind of racists overtones - the BNP is very happy to be associated with those racist ideas because, surprise surprise, their voters think that way so it keeps using that language. 

In essence, you're saying that the main three parties of this country don't want to see White Brits become a minority but are attempting to conceal this, and are secretly trying to prevent this in practice?

This is simply not true. The Labour party purposely implemented an immigration system during Blair's reign that would fundamentally change the demographics of the UK permanently. Left wing thinking views race as a social construct. Why would a left wing party like Labour want to stop the White British becoming a minority? This is neither in their interest nor a part of their policy. You have absolutely no evidence to suggest such a thing. The Liberal Democrats believe in a similar policy. The Conservatives follow an immigration system that will bring about this inevitability.

&gt;Also your focus on White British seems to give away prejudice of your own

What on god's green Earth are you speaking about? You are without doubt one of the strangest people I have ever had to respond to on here. Explain how myself explaining how some people feel about immigration gives away a prejudice that I hold? Your trail of thought is impossible to follow.

&gt;If we got rid of 100% of the immigrants that have settled here in the last 100 years this country would not be 100% White British

If you're including immigrant descended people in that figure then the White British population of the UK would be close to 100% 

&gt;There are plenty of non-White British citizens who have just as much a right to the opinions you hold and just as much right to claim 'ownership' of the country you want to socially engineer as you do. 

Where have I stated how I want to socially engineer this country? Why would I believe non-white citizens of the UK don't have a claim of ownership of the country?

What about the people who at the same time were advocating the opposite - that homosexuals and/or women should be treated much more strictly? No doubt someone in the 1920's was still calling for long prison sentences for sodomy, perhaps even the death sentence. Opinion is shaped not just by what you agree with, but also what you disagree with, and those rights were won through a process of consensus which made it unacceptable to treat gay men and women as if they were mentally ill and/or criminal. The people who espoused that opinion were slowly squeezed out of public debate, even though there would still have been many hardline Christians who agreed with them. They would have been socially ostracized in mainstream society for their bigotry, and would have increasingly struggled to have their views disseminated through newspapers and magazines, which disagreed with their opinion. Similarly, if today someone prominent (say, a BBC newsreader) came out and said that gay men should be subject to chemical castration, they would be forced to apologize or resign.

This is a fairy tale fantasy for me, people will still have bills to pay and food to buy, and if there's a worker who can work to boost the economy there's no way the government would be happy just having them sit off doing nothing 

Government and corporations care about profit, they are not aiming towards a utopia in which everyone can sit back and relax and nobody works. They don't want that. They want more money. And humans are still money making machines. And if a money making machine is capable of making money, they don't care about giving the money making machine a life of riley, they don't care about improving the money making machines quality of life. 

They don't care about what the money making machine wants. They care about making the money making machine make more money. The world is a global economic race to the top and no government will be aiming towards a utopia like that if it means falling behind in the race.

**One Week Later** The Doctor and Rose disappear on holiday, which only lasts three weeks or so but in that time they manage to make their way to Singapore.  Exhausted and short of funds, they return to Britain where The Doctor joins Torchwood as its scientific director.

**Six Months Later** The Doctor's time as a scientific director came to an end a week after he realised it meant staying in one place and going to a lot of meetings.  He and Rose are now field agents for the organisation, always travelling in search of alien items and situations.  The two are inseperable.

**A Year Later**  There is a briefly turbulent time following The Doctor's unexpected proposal and Rose's realisation that one thing she doesn't want is a normal life.  

**Five Years Later** The Doctor retires from active duty with Torchwood to spend more time with his young family.  He returns to the post of scientific director.  Rose also retires from Torchwood and, with the help of Sarah Jane Smith, goes into travel journalism.  Her blog  and newspaper column are a credible success and she's offered television work.

With two kids to look after, The Doctor becomes an increasingly work from home dad.

**Ten Years Later** Rose comes home after a trip to Vietnam and finds her husband and their two children missing.  Her only clues to their whereabouts are a hastily scribbled note on the kitchen table which reads ""Back soon!"" and four blast marks on the back lawn.  Fearing the worst, she finally investigates what her husband has been doing in the shed.

**Twenty Years Later**  Their youngest moves out, and so does Rose.  In ten years she's grown apart from the man who doesn't seem to understand how to age and mature sensibly.  For his part, The Doctor seems content to make huge contributions to the world of science and technology.  The pace of the world's advance is set by him and although he's a loving and involved father Rose can't help but speculate that he's up to something.

**Forty Years Later**  The Doctor unveils his Tardis.  It looks like a Police Box, the inside is bigger than the outside, and there all resemblance ends.  The console room looks like an explosion in an electronics shop.  This is what the Doctor has been working on, in secret, for decades.

The maiden flight sees The Doctor accompanied by his granddaughters Barbara and Susan.  Rose, still officially married to the white haired and thoroughly eccentric old man, declines the trip having seen quite enough time travel for one life.  However, on the return of the girls and on being met with the line ""all of time and space, hmmm?"" she agrees on one last grand voyage.

Go to the John Soanes museum after the British Museum. While you are in the British museum find the Dunstable Swan, it is very beautiful. Eat  authentic Chinese food at Chang's noodle round the corner.

Visit the East End. While you are there try and visit Dennis Severs house. You need to book in advance but that is not to be missed. Then if you want to go out in the night there are trendy bars in Dalston and stuff. 

Avoid Covent Garden unless you are rich in general. But do find some good pubs and drink Mild, Bitter, Ale and Porter in them. Also drink some good whisky. 

Eat a good curry. I Like Tayyabs, Lahore Kebab House, Chennai Dosa, Moti Mahal and Mirch Masala. 

Have a good Sunday Roast. Hawksmoor's is excellent but pricey. A little more than you would usually pay.

Go to Borough market. Eat English Cheese at Neal's Yard.

Well, that's an easy question for people like me who believe passionately in free speech to answer!  Of course, they *also* should have had a right to speak.

Let everyone speak their mind and the best arguments will slowly but surely win out.

&gt;if today someone prominent (say, a BBC newsreader) came out and said that gay men should be subject to chemical castration, they would be forced to apologize or resign. That is how societies inevitably work, and that is how at least on some level opinions are formed.

But I disagree!  The fact that people are nowadays socially ostracized when e.g. using the N word is precisely because the good arguments have bested the bad.  

Assuming you're not a racist, is it because you live in terror of expressing an unpopular opinion, or is it because you've found the arguments against racism to be more persuasive than the arguments for?  I hope it's the latter!  Also, I find this view of yours that the only way to make progress is through instilling fear is incredibly pessimistic and even misanthropic.

false,montezumasleeping,null,null,"This was all still done within the course of one episode though. And it was definitely the ""power of love"", or ""the power of human belief"", that was the resolving speech that the Doctor gave to the Master.

In DiH, The Doctor's revelation that Danny's love for Clara was something that resolved the overarching character arch of the season, which isn't something we've really seen much of in other NuWho finales. 

DiH also does well by not making the whole world go into chaos. Yes, cybermen were rising from their graves world-wide, but most of them were stationary- waiting for commands from their head-of-command. The Doctor subverts the Master's plans to make him ruler by giving the power of commanding to soldier-boy Danny. The Cybermen are then used to defeat their own attack. That all seems streamlined, and it stuck to the themes that were running throughout the season (Doctor realizes he just ""helps when he can,"" Doctor recognizes Clara and Danny's relationship, the ""emotions are a superpower"" theme used, Danny as a noble soldier who can do things the Doctor can't).

For those asking for explanations as to how Missy returned from Gallifrey, or how she got the technology to make Cybermen, I don't think that stuff is necessary for the episode. We don't need to know how the Master orchestrated everything, the Master does stuff like this.

The major fault I had with this episode was Missy's ""I'm giving the army to you because I want my friend back"" plot that came out of the blue for me.

false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I'm not delusional, I just judge success differently to you apparently. We went from a team that finished 8th and then 7th to a team that finished 2nd and almost grabbed a title in one season. Yet for all their consistent Champions League football and their prestige as a club Arsenal have failed to make a similar step up from 4th place every single year since the days of Viera and Henry, except for 07/08 where they were close and came 3rd. 

Have a proper civilised conversation with a long-standing Arsenal fan (I work pretty closely with three of them) - like an actual conversation away from Reddit and other places biased by ""my club is better than your club"" bullshit, and they'll express most of the frustrations I'm saying. That Wenger has been a good manager for them, that ultimately they kind of have to back him for what he's done at the club, but at the same time it's frustrating as hell that every summer the club hierarchy spends almost nothing on quality players and they win nothing, while the likes of Chelsea, Man Utd and Man City make the signings that win them trophies. And so each season they maybe have a bright spell but other than that they're usually miles back and more worried about finishing 4th over 5th than they are about whether they might come 1st. Which is better than coming 7th, but season after season I could see why it might get a bit wearisome.

I'm not saying that Arsenal aren't doing better than we've been doing the last 5 years - they clearly are. But they're definitely not operating the best in the Premiership because until the FA Cup last year it had been years since they won anything, and quite frequently they'd finish 10-20 points off the title race at the end of the season. And as far as who has been better between us and the Gunners in recent history, it basically depends entirely on how far back you're willing to look because it's not so clear cut and it switches every 10 years or so. 

I mean, does finishing 4th over 7th *really* mean all that much if you're going to get knocked out early on in the Champions League every year and seemingly never spend the extra revenues on players who are capable of winning you trophies? Especially if you're not picking up the odd FA Cup or League Cup on the side every now and then.

false,lawlore,null,null,"Well, as someone who lives and works at a tourist attraction in Kent, I'm all for promoting things on the route between Paris and London. But I'll get to that shortly.

The big question is how long you want to spend in Paris- getting around it in a day, seeing all the big attractions (Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame, Le Louvre etc.) can be done, but they're not exactly next to each other, so factoring in travel time whilst in Paris is important. Don't forget when looking into times that there's also a time difference, the French being an hour ahead- you might arrive in Paris at 10am GMT, but it'd already be 11am French time. Personally, to spend any kind of time in Paris, I'd set the day aside.

Now, with that thought to one side, a few things that are on the way and accessible by train without too much hassle:

* Dover has its famous [White Cliffs](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/white-cliffs-dover/) with gorgeous areas for walking if that's your kind of thing.

* [Canterbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury#Culture) is a gorgeous historic Cathedral city which has a lot to see and do, as well as a decent shopping area and the [Marlowe Theatre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlowe_Theatre) which has been modernised very recently.

* Maidstone is the county town of Kent, and whilst not quite as historic or cultural as other places, is certainly the most popular city in the area for British evenings of pubs and clubs- could be a good stopping point on the way back from Paris for a drink or two of an evening. Also found there is [Kent Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Life), an open air museum.

* Trains also go right through the Medway Towns, where you have a lot of association with the writer Charles Dickens.

You literally said there is no mainstream party that want's to keep immigration below 50% of the population, I suggest UKIP and you ask what I'm talking about...?

&gt;but are attempting to conceal this, and are secretly trying to prevent this in practice?

Not at all. In fact they are doing it very publicly but without using the same unnecessary language you are using. I'm saying that they would never specify the proportions of different races they would like the UK to consist of because it makes them seem prejudiced as if it's not immigration they care about but specific races. If they avoid using that language it makes it linguistically impossible for them to commit to prevent 'white British' becoming a minority without it coming off badly. It's sort of like saying that building a new tank squadron will prevent an invading army from reaching London. It would be a rather strange thing to say though technically true. You'd hope it would never get to that point and talking specifically about London seems to ignore the rest of the country. Talking about the white British being a minority in the context of immigration is like talking about London being taken over in the context of defence policy. It's not going to happen and it's too specific. 

EDIT: Perhaps a better way to put this would be to ask ""Has any mainstream party pledged to keep an invading army out of Central London?"". The answer is clearly no. Does that mean mainstream parties would he happy to let an army into London? Absolutely not. Just because no mainstream party talks about the proportion of white Brits around doesn't mean they wouldn't care if immigration increased to such an extent that we became 50% non-white. That would imply such significant social change that it's next to impossible to even imagine.

My point about Theresa may was specifically that immigration reduction is not done secretly but they aren't doing it with that language in mind or with specific proportions of specific ethnic groups in mind. If they think about any of that, they think in term of 'British' - to do otherwise is demonstrably prejudiced. You say that 'If you're including immigrant descended people in that figure then the White British population of the UK would be close to 100%'; well I'm not because immigrant descendants are mostly British citizens. [In the 2011 census 14.5% of the British population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_England#Ethnicity), i.e those with citizenship through birth or naturalization, were non-white so unless you count ~85% as basically 100% then you shouldn't talk about white British as if you're talking about the whole citizenry. Suggesting that 14.5% of the population should not be taken into account by the government for these purposes is fairly obviously discriminatory on your party hence the reason I pointed it out. If these are not your views then sorry for suggesting they were but you probably should have mentioned it otherwise you tend to take people on face value. 

&gt;Where have I stated how I want to socially engineer this country?

You are suggesting that the government should be dictating it's immigration policy based on percentages of individual races saying that White Brits should be kept as a certain level. The whole reason politicians don't use this language is it sounds like social engineering; it sounds like you're about to start apportioning quotas to certain races every year.

false,orwellsocietyguy,null,null,"&gt; However is it so difficult for you to comprehend that some of what RB says resonates personally with me?

Not at all. He says a lot of good things. They should resonate with you.

&gt; and maybe in some cases hits the nail on the head IMO?

I'd say most of what he talks about is either a) himself and b) pretty much what you'd read in any left wing newspaper (ahem....Guardian) and many of the centrist and right papers.

&gt; in some cases hits the nail on the head

I'm not sure he does. Maybe you think he does, but what exactly have you got from him that's a new idea? His critics have said his book offers nothing new. His videos only seem to offer very limited options. I see a lot of promotion about himself. I've watched several videos where 80% is literally him talking about him. Am I just unlucky?

&gt; I wish more people heard/got/understood this!

He said this: 

1. Stop exporting cars as “other countries have their own fucking cars”.
2. Cancelling personal debt would stimulate the economy more than any ‘too big to fail’ bank quantitative easing.
3. The economy is just a metaphorical device. It’s not real
4. The Revolution we are about to realise, will be fast because the organisms are in place.
5. When men choose not to believe in God, they do not thereafter believe in nothing. They then become capable of believing in anything
6. Collectivization is the most exciting and replicable aspect of the Spanish Revolution
7. George Orwell's 1984 was spot on, aside from a bit of glitter and the fact that we voluntarily install our own screens.

All of this is just utter nonsense. What isn't just waffle is a GCSE level comment. As someone who knows a thing or two about Orwell it's as though he's never read the man.

&gt; RB is talking about in much more subtler tones.

Brand is not subtle in any way. How you can associate that word with him is beyond me. He goes on the BBC and sits there with a TREWS placard held up to camera. (Luckily the cameraman was on it). 

&gt; I just don't think you can take away from what I find agreeable with him by citing other comedians or voices.

You asked. I gave you a list off the top of my head - I could have gone on. I could have cited really important thinkers like Chomsky, Edward Said, Stephen Pinker, Any Goodman, John Pilger. They're not comedians but they have bags of integrity. In Chomskys' case you could say he's affected world events.

&gt; Neither am I going to be convinced that I shouldn't like him 

And I would never suggest you do but People like Brand undermine the left wing argument they don't add to it, so why take him so seriously. People who are politically opposed to him see him as a clown - he's using celebrity as an argument. He's very easy to critique and lampoon. Most people require a return argument - he's put to bed with a one word taunt.

&gt; I can't ignore that even if it's unpopular.

This is the problem. He IS popular. He's on every major TV station and newspaper. He's hugely famous all over the world. But you can't turn up on the world political stage having been the most awful and ridiculous sell out, turn up to a few events in a Merc, make some You Tube videos with nothing more than A-Level student thinking in them and expect to be taken seriously.

How do you think the right wing see Brand? Why do you think left wing voices criticise him? Most left wing people will trumpet Polly Toynbee as a shining light of wonderment.

The good arguments have so far bested the bad that the use of derogatory racist language like 'nigger' has moved largely beyond the terms of mainstream debate, and become unacceptable (outside of 4chan!). The debate is now about whether a lack of black people in British business, theatre or (for instance) in football management is reflective of racist attitudes, or something less sinister, or whether it's fair to concentrate stop and search in inner city areas where gun crime is high, and thereby disproportionately target black people who happen to live in those areas, even though the vast majority of them are innocent of any crime. And so on.

When I was in school, racists were not given an equal platform as non-racists to make their case, nor were people who believe in black superiority, or who believe that Protestants were superior to the Catholics, or Normans superior to the Saxons. Most of my non-racism comes from social attitudes which came from society and from my parents, and there are many things which previously would have been the subject of fierce debate which I am utterly ignorant of. It is impossible that I can be presented with every possible position with equal prominence. This is not saying that progress can only be made through 'instilling fear', it is just a reflection one of the mechanisms which is an inevitable part of education, and of society.

Many people said that this wasn't a problem as users could always switch to another search engine if Google wasn't giving the results they wanted, but it wasn't searchers who were complaining. The people I met (some of whom were involved with the complaints) were people who wanted their sites to be found - they didn't have a choice of using a different search engine. With &gt;95% of search traffic going through Google, if they wanted to be found, they had to rely on Google - and if Google was abusing its dominant position to screw them, they couldn't do anything.

And there seems to be something similar going on here. It's not the people watching the show that 'we' (in the sense of society in general, or the specific 45,000 people) are worried about. At worst they may come away with some unhelpful attitudes towards gender that could get them in trouble later in life. And yes, they can always change the channel.

The people we should be worried about are those who may be negatively affected by the things the viewers pick up from the show. For example, the women who are sexually assaulted by a strange for no reasons other than that he thinks it is funny and wants to get some views/ad. impressions.

Now, whether this show does cross a line (either socially, morally or legally) is a separate question, and I am not in a position to comment on that (having not seen it, or any of this person's stuff).

Individual scenes are very well written, the basic ideas are good, and the effort to connect to the classic show is better than when the new show was first getting started.  But the execution of those ideas is spotty at best.

Characters are inconsistent in their attitude and behaviour.  Their scenes might be good, but they change so much between scenes that it's impossible to take them seriously.

Almost everything that's happened has had plot holes you could drive truck through.  Compare the ""Nethersphere"" arc to the ""Harold Saxon"" arc.  Same villain, approximately.  But one ties itself together and has a solid consistency, the other falls apart the minute you stop to think about it.

The tone is... worse.  Too much angst, too much moralizing, too much hand-wringing.  While these are good to do sometimes, this show should be more fun.  Instead we've had a painfully forced quirkiness combined with obnoxious self-righteousness.  Hopefully ""I'm an idiot in a box!"" means that's finally all over with.

The Doctor waves his magic wand and all the problems go away.  In the classic show the writers destroyed the sonic screwdriver because it had become a crutch, a magic wand that solved all problems.  While the new show made an effort for a while not to go that road, recently it's come back worse than ever.  ""Flatline"" may be the single worst offender, but there are others.  All too often the Doctor pulls a solution from his ass at the last minute.

Very really. Clara is possibly the most inconsistent character in the history of the show. 

Her background is a confused mess. Her personality traits don't exist for most of her episodes, until they are TOLD to us in this season, and suddenly she has a different personality. She bounces from unconditional love of the Doctor to going ""ew he's old now"" or ""I can't trust him!"" to ""I'd die for him!"" sometimes in the same episode.

Having said that if there's no pests in your property then it's unlikely that they would serve a notice for the noise (in my experience) if you're absolutely certain that there are no holes etc. in the property and traps aren't catching anything then the property is fine (in terms of the area in which you rent from the landlord)

If its a flat in the block then the landlord probably pays a service charge in which case there is a management company whom he can probably ask to check for this in the common areas, you could appeal to his greedy capitalist nature by telling him you're thinking of moving out and that no one will want to rent a flat that's infested.

Evidently not, as you don't seem to even understand what a chemical is.

Which explains why you're so easily terrified by spooky sounding conspiracy mumbojumbo.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance
&gt;In chemistry, a chemical substance is a form of matter that has constant chemical composition and characteristic properties.[1] It cannot be separated into components by physical separation methods, i.e. without breaking chemical bonds. It can be solid, liquid, gas, or plasma.

&gt;Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures. **A common example of a chemical substance is pure water;** it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory.

Drinking water which is too pure can cause health issues. Water from 'natural' sources like a 100 year old well next to an idyllic little cottage may well have more fluoride in it than water from a tap in a fluoridated water area, as fluoride is a naturally occurring substance. 

The dosage is the poison, not the substance. A little salt is fine. A massive dose of salt will kill you. Drinking too much water until the salts in your body drop dangerously low will also kill you. The fact massive doses of fluoride can have negative effects doesn't mean any dose of fluoride is bad for you. 

The fact we put chemicals in our water is one of the reasons it doesn't make us violently ill like tap water in some other countries. ",0,1415656396,null,0,1415657404,0,clys3ly,t3_2ltkcw,t1_clys3ly,t1_clyrc9s,null,1426090431,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Developers or consultants generally earn more than analysts or technicians.

My advice would be to learn some python and how to use it within ArcGIS to create scripts etc... and brush up on your spatial analysis and cartography skills, as well as SQL and databases. That's definitely what employers look for! Also try and get a copy of visual studio and create some basic .NET windows applications, it can be so easy with a few tutorials and you'll pick it up super quickly!

I'm currently working on ArcGIS AddIns using .NET (VB), but you can also create them in python or C#, or using javascript for web based stuff. Also learn SVG, it's super cool.

Or alternatively, should we just instead plan to; travel Paris, spend the day there, get a hotel there for the night, and then take a train back the next day (stopping at Canterbury &amp; Maidstone, etc. on the way back?

&gt;As long as we engage in spending that increases demand and develops infrastructure, and so improving future efficiency and productivity, you can pretty much spend what you like

No, all spending increases demand. Government spending to increase demand has no meaning at all. Because there is no reason for the government to borrow money if not to increase demand.

Developing infrastructure is one thing, identifying productive investment in infrastructure is another.

No you cant spend what you like, because everything that you borrow must be paid back, and in the mean time it must be paid interest must be paid on your debts.

&gt; The bonus is, that when demand is returned through such policies and the country is running a near full potential
This is such bullcrap. The UK economy is very close to potential.

Have you never heard of debt sustainability? Seriously google it. Why do countries go through debt restructing..... FFS *facepalm* 

Look its one thing to be wrong, its quite another to be so completely sure in your logic and yet be wrong.

If your approach was right, why does the European Commission insist on debt breaks? 
Why doesn't every country borrow to infinity and spend to infinity every year if it really is that easy to finance debt.

You clearly have no idea what you are talking about and are a good example of the economic illiteracy of this sub and reddit in general.

I think a very large problem here is that these words are vague and by nature hard to define. What one woman might class as harassment, another might actually enjoy partaking in. An example might be joking about the size of her breasts. Some women might feel legitimately oppressed, some would revel in the humour and not feel victimised in the slightest.. in fact, the opposite. For example banter between friends can look offensive to a neutral observer but actually has the effect of strengthening the social bonds between a group of people. It really depends on so many things, what's the relationship between the two. If it's a stranger on the street more people would likely class it as harassment than if it was two colleagues who maybe fancied each other.

You must not be watching the same videos as I am, but whatever... perhaps for me it's not because it's a new idea, it's because someone is saying it - that is ipso facto what I mean by the phrase *hitting the nail on the head*.

&gt; I wish more people heard/got/understood this!

You realise I was referring to Stewart Lee and other non-mentioned comedians. I just include Russel Brand in that.

This sounds like a typical flippant thing for him to say, it really doesn't make any difference to me.

&gt; Cancelling personal debt would stimulate the economy more than any ‘too big to fail’ bank quantitative easing.

I happen to believe this too. I take it you've never really faced hardship like the majority of bottom earners in this country have - crippling debt because of compound errors that fall on top of each other like dominoes. Those at the top have rigged the game so they can never lose. The economy needs a reboot. The banks should not have been bailed out and should have been allowed to fail - that's capitalism in it's truest form.

&gt; The economy is just a metaphorical device. It’s not real

You've never heard of fiat money then - it really is all an illusion when you get to the bottom of it. The economy works because we *believe* it works.

&gt; George Orwell's 1984 was spot on, aside from a bit of glitter and the fact that we voluntarily install our own screens... As someone who knows a thing or two about Orwell it's as though he's never read the man.

I'm not going to argue with you, given your username, I'll simply take your word for it. However I would recommend that it's probably not healthy to focus solely on one book or author - it might foster a kind of insular view... try reading some other author sometime to help broaden your view (-_^)

&gt; RB is talking about in much more subtler tones.
&gt;&gt; Brand is not subtle in any way. How you can associate that word with him is beyond me...

Umm... I guess I should have rephrased that sentence or used hypens:

&gt; But the other guys may talk about other things - or talk about the things RB is talking about - in much more subtler tones.

&gt; You asked.

I didn't. I really didn't.

&gt; I gave you a list off the top of my head - I could have gone on.

No, please don't.

&gt; I could have cited really important thinkers like Chomsky, Edward Said, Stephen Pinker, Any Goodman, John Pilger. They're not comedians but they have bags of integrity. In Chomskys' case you could say he's affected world events.

Oh, you did anyway.

&gt; And I would never suggest you do but People like Brand undermine the left wing argument they don't add to it, so why take him so seriously.

You seem to take him far more seriously than I do. I personally don't find him to be undermining anything, but I don't personally consider myself ""left wing"", neither do I consider myself ""right wing"". In fact I'm sick of partisan politics and duopoly. Personally I'd like to see an end to politics as a career and more direct representation - but I suppose that puts me squarely in the loony camp too.

&gt; How do you think the right wing see Brand? Why do you think left wing voices criticise him?

Ask me if I care.

&gt; Most left wing people will trumpet Polly Toynbee as a shining light of wonderment. Labour speaker, award wining Guardian journalist, President of the Humanist society, defender of the Arts. Surely she would 'resonate' with him? No... she thinks he's a ""bumhole"".

Personally I am not a fan of Polly Toynbee so why should this bother me. You seem to be arguing to the populist view - *these people don't like Russel Brand, so you shouldn't* and *like these comedians instead*. I can think for myself and I don't think you've provided any new revelation for me.

And I would actually say Steven Moffat has done a lot of fantastic things for Doctor Who on the production side of things. My only beef is the writing.

I love him for casting Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi. I loved the fairy tale direction of series 5. I think the crack in the wall is one of the best ideas he's ever had. He definitely has a knack for putting a Doctor Who spin on the most simplest things.

But i am seeing more people (even ones i know are vehemently anti-Poch) say that changing manager at this point would be useless and the issue isn't Poch it's the players or the club itself.

Friend of mine was at the match yesterday and told me that in his section a couple of season ticket holders had signs that read ""Levy Out"" and that they were torn down by the stewards almost as fast as the went up.  He was telling me that these guys (long time ST holders) have never been anti-Levy, but they have been drifting that way lately and with the signs being torn down they are now firmly in the Anti-Levy camp (i personally don't know why they would think that the club would allow something that was effectively against the ownership to be displayed but....so be it).

I keep seeing more and more people drifting that way be it over the squad performance, the pricing, the unrealistic expectations that the club promotes there is just a general feeling of dissatisfaction setting in across many of the supporters (old and new) and i think our poor performance is just exacerbating it as people look for a direction to vent and more and more eyes are falling on Levy.

I think Levy has done a good job undoing a quarter-century of mediocrity and deserves a great deal of credit for it. I also think that (whether people like him or not) are much better off with Levy in charge than many other teams.

S5 Eleventh Hour - 10.08 - New Doctor

S6 Impossible Astronaut - 8.86

S7 Asylum Of The Daleks - 6.4

S7.5 Bells Of St. John - 6.18

S8 Deep Breath - 9.17 - New Doctor 

Going from S4 - 9.1 (without iPlayer figures for a series opener to S7 - 6.4 (with iPlayer figures) in 3 series is a hell of a drop. It's even worse if you count Planet Of The Dead.

I will not deny that globally, Who is as popular as it's ever been.

But it's core UK audience is slipping away bit by bit every year.

We're delivered around 10 episodes and a Christmas special a year with mostly human characters, a large percentage of modern day Earth as a setting and average CGI. It has a budget of about £1m (~$1.5M) per episode.

Then take something like Battlestar Galactica. You're getting a full 20 episode season packed with a shitload of movie-quality CGI and practical effects for battles. Significantly better writing than we're getting in Who recently, significantly more actors and with a little less budget. Not many shows do aliens anymore unfortunately, I guess you can count the CGI centurions.

To complain about budget is a joke when people are delivering TV of significantly higher quality in terms of effects (quality and amount), number of actors and the quality of scriptwriting for the same money. Not to mention that BSG is 10 years old and that CGI has been getting better and less expensive.

Which is personally why I find all the Moffat hate excessive because a lot of things commonly pointed to and some of the issues you listed are not actually outright issues. I can see how someone might have a problem with it, but this quickly becomes an exercise in subjectivity and what kind of show each person expects from Doctor Who.

&gt; how did the Master escape Gallifrey? Not explained. 

In a narrative sense, there's no reason for Missy to mention how she escaped because that could be a clue to finding Gallifrey. If she had outright won or actually been taken along as a companion with the Doctor, she would have probably shared that information. But until then, it functions as a solid card to keep in her pocket. She ended up using that to her advantage in her revenge against the Doctor for losing. She gets killed, but inflicts a final emotional wound from beyond the grave by getting his Gallifrey hopes up and sending him to empty space instead.

On a meta level, there's no doubt that the Doctor will eventually find Gallifrey. Moffat has gone on record about the search for Gallifrey being tied into a multi-series arc. This is really just another component in a larger construction, so there's plenty of time for answers to come. So that's really not a weakness.

The demand for an episode to include immediate answers rather than laying seeds for longer arcs is a personal preference.  

&gt; How did she get control of the cybermen? Not explained, which I was extra dissatisfied with because it meant the cybermen were just nondescript alien of the week conflict when they can and have been so much more interesting than that, in fact it's kind of exactly what he did with the daleks in Asylum of the Daleks.

The episodes were overstuffed as it is. I'm more than okay assuming that Missy is every bit the genius that the Master has been historically mentioned to be. She had Gallifreyan technology. She likely had a time machine, as the Doctor mentioned. She didn't need actual Cyberman nor control over them. She just needed Cyberman technology to adapt to her own purposes.

And the rest of this is a case of [your mileage may vary](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YMMV). Personally, the Cybermen didn't come off as monsters of the week. They served as good tools to explore issues the show doesn't usually explore so bluntly and a great excuse for body horror. I honestly think ""Death in Heaven"" used them better than any other Cybermen story of New Who.

There's a slight connection to ""Asylum of the Daleks"" in that the enemies in both convert humans. The important difference being that it's played as a twist in Asylum and used to provide insight into how much the Daleks have come to hate and fear the Doctor. Here, the focus is on humanity's largest fear being exploited to provide bodies for an army and the question of what the Doctor would become if he had control of that army.

&gt;Where's the cyberplanner? Not explained, you could have that AI interface be the cyberplanner and he could have been a really cool second tier villain, but no, just some throw away character whose only purpose was exposition.

She didn't need any of the actual existing Cybermen armies. The technology is self-replicating. I don't imagine it would be hard for someone who can build a paradox machine to hack their software. 

Nor are her goals completely unaligned if she was to have worked with existing Cybermen: allying with a Timelord who will greatly extend their ranks and, if successful, put them strategically under control of one of the most feared people in the universe.

&gt; Then he kills off that scientist lady on her second episode, again, just a waste of a character you could do so much more with, both in the rest of the series and in the episode.

Isn't any character lost a character you could do more with? There was a clear narrative reason for doing so. Killing Osgood was Missy's [kick the dog moment](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog), an act meant to demonstrate to the audience that however likably charismatic Missy is, she is still capable of [undeniable evil things](http://scriptscribbles.tumblr.com/post/102127333506/steven-moffat-on-killing-osgood). That's something the script needed to prove beyond an abstract ""raising the dead for the Cybermen"" way to justify having  the Doctor even consider killing Missy.

Otherwise, Osgood got great character development over a two episode arc. That's more than most. I'm sure everyone who loved her, and there are tons it seems, will be disappointed she's not the new companion. I'm not. I liked her but she's too much of an obvious fan stand in to have tag along weekly.

&gt; Really the whole UNIT storyline had nothing to do with anything, it was just a way to throw in a Brigadier reference, which I don't object to on principle but again it's just so poorly thought out.

This I agree with. It felt mostly like padding, but worth it for the invasion protocols giving the Doctor the exact thing the Master's failed many times trying to attain: complete control of Earth. If you're willing to overlook the idea that any of the world's developed nations would cede authority to the Doctor, it's a great way to have the Doctor throw that in the Master's face. And a way to draw another parallel between the Master and the Doctor...underlining their similarity.

&gt; Neil Gaiman left that piece of Cyberman floating in space after Nightmare in Silver for a reason

A cybermite floating in space in some time period well past the 31st century...I don't know how you would expect the Master to have stumbled upon that. Needle in a haystack doesn't even begin to describe how hard it would be to find if she even knew to look for it in the first place.

The overall point is that it's okay that you've taken issue with the episode. You've a right to your opinion and not obligated to love an episode or all of it. But not all of the things you're using as objective evidence of Moffat's failings as a writer are actually failings. They're rooted in personal preference.

false,lawlore,null,null,"Well, I'll be honest, it's not the easiest route to take in things on the way, simply because the most common route from London to Paris on the Eurostar train is high-speed and doesn't stop at many places on the way. There are only two stops in England (Ebbsfleet and Ashford) and two in France (Calais and Lille).

Now, Ebbsfleet is a purpose-built station and is basically a concrete hub in the middle of nowhere, so I wouldn't recommend getting off there. Ashford, on the other hand, is quite nice itself, but also a very good access point for Canterbury, which is likely to be your best chance of visiting somewhere interesting on the return journey.

Whether you want to stay a night in Paris or not is up to you, but I would imagine it quite difficult to comfortably visit both Paris and somewhere else in a satisfactory way in one day. So, if you definitely want to visit places on the way back from Paris, I would suggest looking into doing the following as the journey:

* Pre-order a return ticket on the Eurostar from London St. Pancras to Paris, and go to Paris. The earlier you book, the cheaper they'll be- you can book for returning the same day or the following day, that's up to you.

* On the return journey from Paris to London, leave the train at Ashford International, and buy an ""Open Return"" ticket to Canterbury. This appears to be around £7 - £8. The ""Open Return"" allows you to make that same return journey at any time on the same day.

* From the Ashford International station, there is a train to Canterbury West station- it is a very short, 15 minute journey (two stops on the train), and the Canterbury West station is reasonably central to the city of Canterbury.

* Visit Canterbury.

* From Canterbury, your ""Open Return"" ticket will allow you to go back to Ashford International. This will allow you to complete your journey directly back to London.

The big sticking point with this, and it's something I unfortunately can't give too much information about, would be the return times on the Eurostar. With domestic trains in the area, there's no seat reservations or anything of that nature- it doesn't matter what time you get on a train to your destination, as long as you have a ticket. But with the Eurostar, you have to book for a specific train, so whilst in Canterbury, you'd have to keep an eye on the clock to make sure you didn't miss your returning train from Ashford, as your ticket would not be valid on a later one.

If you're feeling more adventurous and do stay in Paris overnight, giving more time on the return, you could always trace another route back from Canterbury to visit more- the domestic service is quite good in the area for getting back to London. This would, of course, require other tickets, but the stations themselves can help you with those.

Joining the European Economic Community (E**E**C), to which, as you correctly state, [the British people consented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975), involved signing up to 'a common market offering free movement of goods, service, *people* and capital [my italics]'.

Prior to this, Edward Heath's Conservatives won an election with a manifesto that stated ['If we can negotiate the right terms, we believe that it would be in the long-term interest of the British people for Britain to join the European Economic Community'](http://www.conservative-party.net/manifestos/1970/1970-conservative-manifesto.shtml) and were duly elected. That government joined the EEC, and the subsequent Labour government offered the referendum which the British people accepted. So, not only were the British people offered a choice on whether they accepted, in principle, freedom of movement within Europe, they subsequently agreed to it (among other things) in the first referendum in British history, and thus far the only one that returned a 'Yes', with a majority of 67.23%.

Subsequently we have, within the basic structure of the four freedoms, been allowed choose not to opt-in to some aspects of freedom of movement of people: For example, Britain is not part of the [Schengen Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement), so even EU citizens need a passport to enter Britain.

The particular thing you probably wanted to refer to is the [2004 expansion of the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union). This was in [negotiation from 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union#Progress). During the time from the start of the negotiations till their completion, there were three UK General Elections and two European Parliament Elections. That's five elections in which we had a chance to say we didn't want immigration from these countries. To argue that we didn't have a chance to oppose expansion of the EU - and the increase in immigration that might entail - is thus clearly nonsense. We had fourteen years of negotiations in which to say we didn't want this to happen, and five elections to make our view clear.

So how did we vote?

In two out of three of these General Elections, Britain voted against the more Eurosceptic Conservatives. In the first of the two EU elections, Britain likewise voted against the Eurosceptic Conservatives. In both EU elections and in the final two General Elections in this period, the most Europhile party - the Liberal Democrats - increased their share of the vote.


Now, feel free to argue that we didn't know, or no-one pays attention to EU negotations, or it was an economic boom so no-one minded, or whatever. But don't argue that we never had a chance to oppose freedom of movement: We had a referendum; we had forty years of elections.",0,1415662393,null,0,false,0,clyvb1p,t3_2lv1sj,t1_clyvb1p,t1_clysj3i,null,1426088869,11,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,11

This is my main problem with Moffat's reign. I loved Season 5, and much of season 6, but that's when it started:

200 years of The Doctor's life: Off-screen.

The Doctor and River's ""romance"": (mostly) Off-screen.

Then season 7:

10 years of Amy, Rory and The Doctor: Off-screen.

The Doctor and Clara's getting-to-know-you phase: Off-screen.

900 years (WHAT?! WHY!?) of defending Trenzalore: Off-screen.

Important things transpired during those times, and I feel cheated as a viewer to not have borne witness to them, and correspondingly, their on-screen ramifications feel paper-thin.

I can't shake the feeling that those things are off-screen and just taken for granted in dialogue because they're difficult to write, and because Moffat wanted to lay claim to the longest-lived Doctor, and he could, so he *did*.

In two seasons, Eleven lived for longer than the previous two doctors combined (forty times over)... in three seasons, Eleven lived for longer than *all* the prior Doctors *combined*. There's something that is *wrong* about that.

There's no rule being broken, so far as I'm aware, but it rubs me the wrong way. I love and miss Eleven a lot, I've grown to like twelve, but the latter half of season 7, and all but ~~-3-~~ 5 episodes of season 8 have been poor-to-awful... I thought it was a creative brain drain after the *spectacular* 50th, but there's something more going on - it's like Moffat has become apathetic about the show.",0,1415662966,null,0,1415663217,0,clyvlee,t3_2lpgwc,t1_clyvlee,t1_clwxawb,null,1426088734,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Landlords can choose to let their properties lie empty if operating costs are more than revenue or they may choose to sell the property. Landlords do not have to rent out at the market rate, but tenants must rent at that rate.

&gt;Demand is price elastic-double the rent and the demand for rentals will fall very sharply.

That's a ridiculous hypothetical, but to take it further, if rent were to double because every other housing alternative had seen a similar increase in price, then people would pay that much because ultimately they need somewhere to live. [According to the ONS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/index-of-private-housing-rental-prices/historical-series/index.html), rent has increased by over 10% in the last 8 years and demand remains as high as ever.

His resurrection went wrong and he was burning it up. This season she escaped from the dimension Galiffrey is in, stole a tardis, stole the data drive, been following the Doctor for who knows how long, for some reason wanted Clara and the Doctor together, got complete control over the cybermen, and then gave them to the Doctor as a present to get him to travel with her.

If the Master could escape why couldn't the other escape as well?  How did she get control of the cybermen? She gave a reason for putting Clara and the Doctor together, but I found it very unbelievable.  Moffat will probably change the reason next season. The Master did like messing with the Doctor, but never had wanted to be together with him. Last time the Master died instead of being trapped with the Doctor.

I did like the new Master. The craziness mixed with having fun, but giving all that power away seemed off. The Master is more of a character that would keep the power and say come and try to stop me.

It also seems like you tie the idea of people not liking this to Matt not being the Doctor anymore.  I can't speak for everyone,  but I find it more being the writing of the show has gone down a lot this season. I have noticed and others have too, that this season has a lot of episodes that seem to be based on old episodes. I like the new Doctor and Clara. I think they have so much potential, but nothing happens with it. I even liked Mr Pink and  feel really bad about how things went with him. I wish the Doctor had tried to unconvert him since the cybermen were like the ones that tried to convert the Doctor last season and  they were kind of souless cybermen. They were more cybermen shells controlled by the Master. I also guess you didn't mind the bringing the dead back from the data drive? Had no reasoning to work, but just a plot for them to give the Doctor a way to think Mr Pink came back to life.

Last, I want to point out you poke fun of an old season, but you don't try to back up the problems this past season had. In my post I asked the ones who liked this season to explain about what they think about the problems.  I even said when I re watch the past seasons I skip episodes.

&gt; Some could say that people who look back on the past tend to wear rose tinted glasses.

and then I wasn't surprised at all?

I'm not just looking at the past this way.  I'm watching and rewatching episodes from 1963 and 1965 and 1970 and 1974 and 1989 and 1996 and 2005 and 2007 and 2010 and 2013 and 2014 and everything in between.  This isn't the past to me.   I'm watching all of these now.  If that can only be described as looking at the past with rose tinted glasses, then how can anyone interact with the past at all?

Or do you mean that I remember those episodes from when they were broadcast?  Because I don't.  I only watched half of Classic Who in the past fifteen years, and much of it more recently than that.

Regardless, I'm pretty critical about much Classic Who, and I still think it's better than the past few years.

&gt;If you are going to blame anyone, surely it should be RTD for this, as Moffat was part of the crew back then, and RTD pretty much sowed the seeds for everything that has happened since.

Why would I blame RTD when the episodes of Moffat's that he oversaw were like 85% good stuff?  If you had asked me around 2008, when the only Moffat things I'd seen were ""The Empty Child,"" ""The Doctor Dances,"" ""The Girl in the Fireplace,"" ""Blink,"" and *Jekyll*, I would have recommended Moffat as showrunner.

They're unproven against big teams and they will fall apart there. That's 7 points

Our next 8 games are Palace (A), Stoke (H), Leicester (A), Sunderland (H), United (A), Arsenal (H), Burnley (A), Swansea (H). If we beat 5 of Palace, Stoke, Leicester, Sunderland, Burnley and Swansea then draw and win one of Arsenal and United that's 16 points and we've closed the gap. That is not THAT tall an order even in our current form. Worst case we lose to Arsenal and United and pick up two losses from the other 6 then we're still up 12 points and only 6 behind Southampton. 

I know this is all hypothetical but the point I'm making is that it's so early in the season to make these sweeping judgements about how shit we are. Last year at this stage City were 8th and they won the league. Early games skew the table, smaller teams have good runs of form or easy fixtures (as Southampton have) and make bigger teams look bad.

There are rough areas, but if you've got money then it's easy to live in a nice part of the city or somewhere close by but in the countryside a bit (most of the footballers seem to do that). Pretty much all of my friends who have spent meaningful amounts of time living in or around Liverpool but weren't brought up in the area have said they were surprised how much they fell in love with the city - suggesting it's good but that their expectations perhaps weren't so high beforehand.

In some ways it has a bad reputation in the same sense that most industrial cities do now that more manufacturing is being done in the far east and we're no longer mining coal and such at the same rate we used to. Back 50-100 years ago it was one of the most affluent and fastest-growing cities in the UK, and then the 80's happened and a lot of the money disappeared from the area and it became pretty run-down. It's recovered a lot now, but it still hasn't fully shaken off the reputation. 

I wouldn't say it was that Liverpool is bad (it's definitely not worse than Manchester in my admittedly biased opinion), but London is a pretty attractive city - it's massive, it's fashionable, it's incredibly affluent, etc. The South East of England also has nicer weather than the North West.

Not really. I type quickly.

OK you went there. You could have given an example.

Here you retort to his statements::::: 

&gt; This sounds like a typical flippant thing for him to say, it really doesn't make any difference to me.

No this is an entire section in his book (have you read it?). It's a major point he makes. It's a very stupid point that really doesn't understand anything about the car industry. It's borderline laughable.

&gt; I happen to believe this too.

So you admit that you don't understand banking or quantitive easing? This sentence is nonsense. Quantitive Easing is governments issuing more credit - it has nothing to do with a bank thats too big to fail. It's like saying ""credit card post office"".

&gt; You've never heard of fiat money then

If it's ""a con"" why does he repeatedly talk about way to ""stimulating the economy"" in his book. I suspected you'd fall for that one.

&gt; I admit I have no idea what he means here.

You're not alone.

&gt; I gues replicable could be debated and exciting is a matter of opinion.

You know nothing at all of Spanish history then?

&gt; However I would recommend that it's probably not healthy to focus solely on one book or author

Concerning the previous point Brand talks about Orwells history in Spaign where he fought in the Spanish civil war, gets it completely wrong, then further bungles his way through 1984. It's not my argument it's his. But if an A level student handed this in as a paper to me I'd have a one-2-one with them and ask it they had an angry uncle at home. 

&gt;I didn't. I really didn't.

To quote you you said 

&gt;""he seems to have particular insight that is missing from the political discourse, and even from many ""left"" discussions.""

It's not missing at all. It's pretty much Guardian headlines. The thing it's it's also right wing headlines too. I wouldn't mind but I don't need Mr Brand telling me no one is talking about banking reform the same day the Daily Mail launch a scathing front page attack on it.

&gt; Oh, you did anyway.

Ironically Brand lists several of these in his book. It's ironic you miss this.

&gt; Ask me if I care.

The apathy is thick with this one. 

You're typical of his audience who are so disengaged in politics that your own laziness is now a point for discussion. The reason why you're disengaged in politics is because your life is so comfortable.

The German Empire was exactly as imperialistic and militaristic as the British one, this is the problem when nationalism rules history and morality dies. The fact is the German masses were freer than the British masses, not that that's saying much at the time. However we can't utter that fact because that would hit the myth that's been under construction for the last few years about WW1 fought to protect British freedom and nation, a putrid nationalism emerging today which is the very reason those people died in the first place is the biggest insult to the dead possible. The working-classes of both countries who died for their imperialist ruling-class and a nation they had little say in running, could have and should have stopped the war earlier so millions of people didn't needlessly die for literally nothing. By 1917 Britain and Germany were already suffering heavy revolts of their troops who were refusing to fight and often going on strike against their miserable conditions and their brutal masters. It was those rebellions in the army and navy, and by workers at Kiel etc. which would ultimately forced Germany to surrender, and would afterwards be used by the Nazi's to create a 'stab-in-the-back-myth' to demonise communists and jews (which in Germany at the time was essentially synonymous). Workers should have appealed to their internationalism of class consciousness and against the barbarism of nationhood, but of course those that tried to proclaim that 'brotherhood among peoples' where mercilessly killed and silenced by governments committed to a war to defend the interests of the ruling-class who were in fact what is meant by 'the nation'.

Everyone should have refused conscription, on all sides and then the war would have ended. There's nothing more authoritarian than a state forcing you to fight and die for it, and even worst people destroy the realities of that time by saying those soldiers should be thankful for fighting.

THE DURHAM LIGHT INFANTRY 

When I was just a young lad I used to mine the land 
With a pick across my shoulder or a shovel in my hand 
But then the bloody war came and my hero's instincts grew 
And the posters in the street said 
""Your country needs you"" 
Those words struck through 
For I knew then what I must do 

So Billy signed up for a soldier's bloody wage 
And Jimmy joined the navy so that he could rule the waves 
And they stood so proud and smart in their uniforms so new 
And the people lined the street with flags 
Coloured red white and blue 
Coloured red white and blue 
And you'll die for your country too 

So we're off my boys through the hell and the noise 
To die for our country 
And they'll raise a cross to remember the loss 
Of the Durham Light Infantry 

In the muddy fields of Flanders we fought like men from hell 
And the ground itself was ripped apart where all my best mates fell 
Jacky Cranston got his balls blown off and a shell took Chorley's leg 
And in all that hell and madness 
I wished that I was dead 
I wished that I was dead 
And all the sky was filled with lead 

So we buried all our dead at least those that could be found 
As well as bits of bodies that were scattered all around 
And it made me sick with anger at the things the war had done 
But when it was all over we still kept marching on 
We still kept marching on 
Though all my mates are dead and gone 

Now we'll sing a song of victory that was paid for with the brave 
But we're left only with monuments and an unknown soldier's grave 
And a special day once every year to remember them to God 
And commemorate their bravery with a poppy the colour of blood 
A poppy the colour of blood 
But we've paid too high a price with all that blood

That doesn't mean I somehow get the £10 free, it means that I actually spent that money in the course of doing my job - if I charged a customer £100 for a service, I only managed to put £90 in my pocket because of the cost of the oil, and I should therefore only pay tax on that £90.

What I don't get to do is send my mum or my girlfriend to Halfords, have them buy 4 litres of oil for £10 and then have them sell me the oil for £50, therefore allowing them to profit by £40 and have both of us pay tax in a lower band because we've split our tax liabilities. I'm pretty sure the taxman would come down on us pretty hard if my family tried to do that.

AVB called it ""provoking the opposition with the ball"" and that's what Erik does very well right now. He doesn't always make the right decision or get the final ball right, but he tends to play a part in most of our dangerous attacks and he's created more than anyone except Eriksen.

Personally going for Martinez isn't exactly the best idea. He'd be way too costly and there's really no sure fired proof to see if he'd replicate his abilities in a league like the Premier League. I'm not trying to knock either league, but doing well in Mexico's league and Portugal's doesn't exactly translate into instant success in England. England's a bit of a different animal, you take a look at Ricky Van Wolfswinkel who was good in Netherlands and Portugal but mediocre in England.

 It's worth taking in consideration the support system he has at Porto that allows him to really shine. Also he's a bit on the older side for someone that can command that much cash, hard to say if it'd be worth it in the long run.

This buy would've made more sense when there was talks of him in 2011-2012 coming to Europe. Unfortunately if I remember right at that time, he publicly said he was a little turned off and awkward'd out when a bunch of news leaks stated saying it was a done deal/sure thing that he was signed by Liverpool in 2012.

While I'm aware his initial intent when he was in Mexico was to really boost himself with a team in England, he's obviously already at a status where he could pretty much go anywhere.

false,Blaster395,eng-somerset,Somerset,"This is simply inaccurate, a result of postwar literature that was largely written by those who opposed the war. Let me go through the inaccuracies in your post 
One by one.

Claim one: soldiers overwhelmingly opposed the war.

There are several ways that this can be disproved. Firstly, volunteering for the military remained high throughout the war  even with the casualty figures being widely known. This was the height of nationalism so suggesting that soldiers suddenly stopped wanting to fight is absurd. Secondly there are accounts of people who outright enjoyed ww1, most famous among them being Hitler but a view undoubtably shared by many. Germans especially wanted the war to continue.

Claim 2: everyone dying in 15 mins

This stems from the classic image of men going over the top in a wave to be machine gunned down hopelessly. This is a completely wrong picture of both what killed in ww1 and what tactics were used.

Artillery was the main killer. Shelling 24/7 that made assaulting enemy trenches actually be the preferred activity of soldiers over the tedium of hiding while being shelled.

The actual process of assaulting enemy trenches was one of successful a attacks repelled by counter attacks. The front lines were often several trenches deep and, in many cases, the front trench was undefended.

Soldiers DID NOT march in Napoleonic formations towards enemy trenches. They used skirmish tactics. During these assaults most deaths came from in-trench fighting, not from the process of running to the next trench. Most assaults had the goal of capturing POWs to interrogate for intelligence.

Claim 3:  the poor suffered the most

A disproportionate number of combatants and deaths were upper and middle class. Ww1 was the end of the minor nobility in much of europe. 

Claim 4: pointless battles 

Every battle in wwi has a purpose. The Somme was to prevent a French loss at Ypres by putting pressure on the Germans elsewhere. The big blunder was actually Gallipoli, though the original naval invasion only plan would have worked just fine.

Claim 5: myths about WWI glorify it

The public myth of WWI is that the leadership was completely  bonkers and evil, and the whole thing is pointless. Nobody seriously glorifies wwi any more.

Pedantry:

The truth about whether people thought the war was worth it requires nuance and doesn't have an easy answer.

Otherwise they would have stopped. Have you considered, for one thing, that a century ago people WERE nationalistic, and didn't see it in the way you do? Or perhaps you have some explanation of why millions decided to engage in the largest collective slaughter in history while having no idea quite why they were doing it?

Mancini, Wenger, Mourihno and AVB all wanted him to have nothing to do with their team for a reason despite his productivity and his attitude has not gotten better with age. Letting him go on a loan in the January market with an agreement to pay part of his wage might be the best deal Levy could possibly do. Something needs to happen with the chemistry on this team and I can think of a couple of talented veterans who aren't playing like they give a shit. Adebayor though, he's locker-room poison and that has been proven on many occasions.",0,1415670096,null,0,false,0,clyz5hi,t3_2lunku,t1_clyz5hi,t3_2lunku,null,1426087062,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Such an element may exist in other parties too, they're just less prone to getting caught making racist songs or making public statements with a certain Jim Davidson quality to them.

The problem I have with this idea that we need to listen to immigration concerns is there is practically no middle ground in opinion, UKIP supporters by and large seem to want to massively restrict it while most everyone else would rather not.  I don't believe a compromise is acceptable for either group so what's to discuss? it's a fundamental difference and if anything UKIP voters seem even less willing to discuss it than everyone else in the sense that anything contrary to the UKIP position is rubbished as liblabcon lies or whatever.  It's a polarising issue, it's not as if we can concede a few EU immigrants to calm down the kippers while maintaining EU membership for everyone else.

false,Greaseball01,pertwee,Pertwee,"A few points:

I don't believe that Moffat actually plans his arcs anymore, not after Time of the Doctor where they were all thrown together in a barely comprehensible, sweaty mess. So yeah, I don't buy that any of this is part of a larger plan. Also, searching for Gallifrey wasn't even mentioned before this episode, some arc.

&gt;The episodes were overstuffed as it is. 

Yeah with shit they didn't need to be. 

&gt;I'm more than okay assuming that Missy is every bit the genius that the Master has been historically mentioned to be. 

I mean, the Master's not that clever, he's no dunce but it's kind of a recurring theme at this point that he gets himself into troubling positions which he then can't deal with and so throws them at the Doctor who then invariably solves them in his usual brilliant way. See The Mind of Evil, Survival, and The End of Time. 

&gt;She likely had a time machine 

Didn't they say her tardis was in St. Pauls? That's how she fit all the cybermen and their dark water facility in there? Funny how that was never brought up again.

&gt;the Cybermen didn't come off as monsters of the week. They served as good tools

Do you see the immediate contradiction here?

&gt;I honestly think ""Death in Heaven"" used them better than any other Cybermen story of New Who.

This seriously makes me question your judgement in regards to everything.

&gt;She didn't need any of the actual existing Cybermen armies.

So why use them then? Both from a writing standpoint and within the narrative. If you're going to do literally nothing to connect the cybermen story line (Which has been ongoing since their first episode in 1966, that's right, every cybermen episode in old who was connected by a common universe and ongoing timeline, Nightmare in Silver was the first time New Who actually attempted to reconnect with it, shame we couldn't keep that going) to the plot of your episode then why bother having the cybermen in it at all? 

&gt;Killing Osgood was Missy's kick the dog moment,

I imagine it would have been more effective in that regard if we'd had more than one episode of Osgood and literally any information about her as a person, beyond her being clever, asthmatic, and a fan of the Doctor.

&gt;A cybermite floating in space in some time period well past the 31st century...I don't know how you would expect the Master to have stumbled upon that. Needle in a haystack doesn't even begin to describe how hard it would be to find if she even knew to look for it in the first place.

She said, and we have actively seen her during the season, that she's been watching and exploring the Doctor's time stream, paying particular attention to him and Clara's time together. The destruction of  Hedgewick's World happened after she gave Clara the Doctor's number, so Missy had no reason not to be watching, and Moff went out of his way to assure us that she was. This would also explain how Missy's cybermen can be more advanced than they are in the 31st century (Recall the fact that cybermen couldn't fly on Hedgewick's World being one of the tactical advantages the team had during that misadventure). See how easy it was to come up with a simple explanation that makes sense? Adds a bit of continuity too, which earlier you seemed to be implying was something Moffat actively tries to maintain, again, I don't buy it. 

&gt;You're judging the episode by what you want it to do rather than what it set out to do.

I want it to be better, that's all.  ",0,1415673541,null,0,1415673736,0,clz0xmy,t3_2lu2dq,t1_clz0xmy,t1_clyv0ld,null,1426086231,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

My experience with the last minute Leicester Square tickets is that you're going to be seeing Phantom of the Opera or Billy Elliot. However, it's right near Chinatown.

The cool thing about the museums is that they are usually free. Some of them are right next to each other. I personally like the Tate Modern. Here are a few: http://www.timeout.com/london/attractions/top-london-museums  

It is pretty fun to pop over to Paris on the train, but that might be too much. Can you not spend a few more days there? If you get a first class ticket on the train, **you get free champagne.**  

If you are planning to go to Birmingham after work finishes at 3pm, be aware that public transportation doesn't run all night. You have to get to the Christmas Market in Birmingham from the train station. The train from London to Birmingham will be about 2 hours and 20 minutes. Christmas Markets close - some at around 6pm. Then you have to get back to where you are staying. Lots of places have Christmas Markets, including Canterbury and the Tate Modern area of London: http://www.christmasmarkets.com/UK.html

You could ignore the ending bits with Missy which ended up being a convoluted plan for nothing and just focus on the stories the best ones being IMO the dalek one, time heist, mummy on the orient express, and flatline. Passable and fun are Deep Breath and Robots of Sherwood. 

Listen is really cool but I don't like the ending conclusion which makes the journey a bit of a waste of time just to have Clara be so important to the doctor's development (more of Moffat shoving his mark onto the franchise).

Caretaker is not a great sci-fi story but it's a fun character story.

To Kill the Moon is an interesting idea but a bit heavy-handed and we really don't get what's going on with Earth with all these changes. How did someone like the Doctor not know the moon was an egg? Sounds like a great novel on its own but put into a show about a know-it-all time traveler is really pushing believability.

Same with Forest of the Night - again an interesting story in another setting but in Doctor Who a little out of place.

The last two though... the first one had promise but it was let down by the second one when the master's grand plan was to give the Doctor an army to see if he would become like the MAster for good intentions and conquer the universe something that the Doctor shrugged off in about 5 seconds - it made those thousands of years of scooping up human souls and whatever deal made with Cybermen pretty much a gigantic waste of time and effort.

Overall though I would say with all the episodes, Capaldi is great to watch as the new Doctor. More in line with the old series particular Pertwee, Harnell, with a bit of Tom Baker. He and clara play off of each other rather well.

false,Locke66,null,null,"I used to work for Odeon and it is an **incredibly** profit focused company so they will do everything they can to reduce their costs and increase their profits.  They take great pride in being the most profitable cinema company rather than being the most popular (Cineworld unless something has changed).  The quality you receive will vary massively across the circuit as they have a ton of aging cinemas from the UCI merger and they provide almost no money for ongoing maintenance costs.  If you are in an area with one cinema that happens to be Odeon don't expect much as they will take your business for granted (which is why they are getting trounced on market share outside the major cities). That said the ones that do get major refurbishments will be top notch as it seems to become a pet project of everyone important at head office.  As you can tell I'm not a huge fan...

Anyway if you want to avoid paying huge amounts of money every time you go the best advice I can give you is:

* Avoid peak times if you can as it's more expensive on fri,sat &amp; sun and after 5pm most day.
* Avoid 3D performances as you will pay a large premium (honestly most of them aren't that impressive in 3D).  
* The ODEON loyalty card is actually very good and it will only take a few trips to earn enough points for a family to get a free ticket (make sure to redeem it for an adult ticket).  If you go in a group of friends make sure they use your loyalty card also or buy the tickets in a group.  Don't redeem it on small amounts of food and drink as you get a lot more value from redeeming it on tickets.  If you are for any reason buying lots of tickets at once then get an ""ultimate"" package card that doubles your points for the first month of purchases + gives you enough points for a free ticket to start with despite the higher starting investment (£9.99).  I helped some families and big groups get 8+ free tickets from birthday party purchases etc. 
* Having a loyalty card qualifies you for ""Film fan Monday/Tuesday"".  This will give you 25% off a ticket which can easily save you more than the card was worth in the first place (£1.99 for a basic card).  The cashiers will not be able to give you 25% off all your tickets if you buy in one bulk purchase because that is how the till is set up but again there is almost nothing to stop you buying single tickets with one card and getting 25% off multiple tickets that way (in theory a cashier may stop you but most won't care or will do it for you regardless).

One final thing to say is generally speaking dont take it out on the people working in the cinema when things go wrong (like massive queues).  Almost everything is controlled by the general manager and he/she is just working to the budget set by head office which is made as tight as it possibly can be and then a little bit extra when it comes to things like payroll as well as the ""not really important things"" like time to train staff to a reasonable level (which is basically a case of sit in front of a computer screen, watch a slideshow and then take a multiple choice test now).

- Pirlo made his 100th UCL appearance, 2nd Italian after Maldini to do so.

- Madrid is on their 10th successive home win and are on a roll of closing in the record of 12th straight home wins in CL set by Man utd between 2006-08. Real Madrid's earlier best was 10th set between 1996-98. 

- CL set a record of 40 goals in one night ( the night of our 6-0 win against Maribor ) 

- The 6-0 Maribor win was a record victory in CL for us.

I see why some might claim positive financial reasons, and I'll claim to be no sports-financial expert but last time Liverpool came to BMO field in Toronto (and again when Spurs came this year) the ticket prices were disgustingly steep. We're talking like $175/seat, for my regular season ticket spots that work out to be about $70/seat. So fans don't win either. That's over double the price, and I understand the need to profit - but given that BMO field has half the capacity of Anfield I doubt that the club is really not making a ton of extra money once it's all said and done.

As for the players, I'm sure they're used to a bit of travel. But not 6+ hours of travel (which would be required for most non-European flights). The affair would turn from a potentially one extra day off/slow to closer to a week long event. The game in Madrid as an example: 1 hour time difference so realistically no jet lag, but the team has to get there minimum 1-2 days before the game to adjust and train, etc. Then presumably the day or two after the game is a travel/rest day, so nothing is accomplished.

Some people just seem to not understand how technology and science works in Doctor Who. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. That's how Doctor Who has always worked.

Also, how has Moffat referenced the show's continuity less than RTD? Did you watch Series 7B? The 50th? The Night of the Doctor? The return of Unit, the return of the Great Intelligence and the direct tie to The Web of Fear, the use of footage from throughout the Classic Series, the regeneration of Eight, the Zygons, the Ice Warriors, the regeneration limit, Coal Hill, all the references scattered throughout 7B (legit one episode of references per Doctor). Have you even watched the show? Every show runner avoids stepping on the previous show runner's feet, but Moffat has been all about references to the Classic Series. As someone who prefers the Classic Series, I prefer Moffat's references to RTD's. RTD basically kept the TARDIS, regeneration, sonic screwdriver, and Gallifrey, brought back the required constant baddies (Daleks, Cybermen, Sontaran, and the Master), and all of those were essentially required for the show to be restarted. Then he referenced some less known ones (the Autons and the Macra), and the only substantial ""reference"" to continuity was Sarah Jane, K9, and Five.  They're pretty much one-for-one, but Moffat worked more with the continuity of Classic, modifying and interacting with it frequently.

1. Psychological. His purchase was built up as *the* solution to our defensive woes - he was going to be a well-rounded CB, able to build from the back, and a vocal leader and organiser all in one. He knew all of that, and, along with the usual amplifier of playing for a ""big club"", it all seems to be affecting him. He regularly reminds me of David Luiz for Brazil against Germany, trying to do everything himself, and in the end doing very little good to anyone.

2. Team setup. Any back four is going to find it easier with Schneiderlin and Wanyama in front of them than they are with a 34-year-old Gerrard. It also doesn't help that our pressing game has dissolved this season - Southampton were the best pressers of the ball in the league last season, even better than us.

3. Coaching. This point applies to every signing and player. We know a big part of Rodgers' success is based around work on the training ground. The return of European football has reduced the amount of days on the training ground Rodgers has per game. That affects match preparation, it affects integrating new players into the system, it affects changes Rodgers wants to make to the system.

&gt;__Propaganda__ is a form of communication aimed towards [influencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_influence) the attitude of a population toward some cause or position.

&gt;Propaganda is information that is not [impartial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(journalism\)) and used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively (thus possibly [lying by omission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lying_by_omission)) to encourage a particular synthesis, or using [loaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_language) messages to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented. Propaganda can be used as a form of ideological or commercial warfare.

&gt;While the term propaganda has acquired a strongly negative connotation by association with its most manipulative and [jingoistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingoistic) examples, propaganda in its original sense was neutral, and could refer to uses that were generally positive, such as public health recommendations, signs encouraging citizens to participate in a census or election, or messages encouraging persons to report crimes to law enforcement, among others.

Now I'm not saying that playing one game overseas is the same as moving the stadium to another city, but it's a good analogy to show how allowing a bleed away from the focal point of the city is a bad thing.

It doesn't affect NBA and NFL teams so much because they already feel like soulless franchises to many non-Americans, since, to a non-American who hasn't been to America, the cultures of most American cities feel the same (except for maybe New York/LA and an acknowledgement of a North/South cultural difference).

false,heman__,null,null,"&gt;We know a big part of Rodgers' success is based around work on the training ground. The return of European football has reduced the amount of days on the training ground Rodgers has per game.

Last season and the season before there was no Europe and the defence still sucked. 

This is his third season and the defence has never improved. Sure, we don't know about Rodgers' defensive training methods but we do know for sure that they have not worked and they do not work. How do we know? Because we let in a fucking ridiculous amount of goals. 

Look at Crystal Palace last season. They were in the bottom three, really struggling and conceding in every game.

While aggression and passion are fine I was struck by how unnecessary it was for Townsend to be having such a massive go at one of our youngest players, playing out of position, for making a very small mistake early on in the first half. You could tell Dier was upset by it because his head immediately dropped and he stopped speaking for the rest of the half.

To me, that's indicative of one of the big problems at Spurs. No one is helping anyone else, the fans are too quick to attack the players and the players are too quick to attack each other.

Did s/he really need to spend eons setting this up for a moral puzzle? Any robotic army would have worked for that moral conundrum.

What would have been better if the Master drove home the point that the humans the Doctor worked so hard to save are now going to turn on the universe.

Anyway, now apparently Missy is God and all the earth gods who promised people an afterlife which technically there was. the ramifications of this should be enormous on humanity but it's just a plot device so move on. 

That's the problem with this plan along with the Silence. Cool villains but seriously how did they and the master operate for thousands of years without the Doctor noticing? They're too big to be believable.

And good point about Moffat making the show not like Doctor Who anymore. He is determined to make his creations the most significant part of the show's development. This is why I don't like the ending of listen with having Clara give the young Doctor his motivation to become who he is. Had she not done so would that mean there never would have been a doctor?

The reason your country's Muslims have problems with integrating to British society is thanks to Saudi Arabia.

Rich Saudis funds mosques and madrassas, and from there they bring in Saudi Wahhabi and Salafi thought. That's how radicalism starts.

America forbid foreign funding of religious places, which allowed for pluralism and liberal values to be a part of American Muslim country.

The key to radicalism of European Muslims is Wahhabism in general. I've seen Wahhabism influenced Muslims in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, and it's no different from Europe.

Also, Wahhabism spreads easier during recession. Poor, disenfranchised Muslims living in Birmingham tends to look up to crazy ideas, and Wahhabism/Salafism's no different in that regard. As Maajid Nawaz said, Wahhabism spreads through a narrative, a narrative that empowers disenfranchised Sunni Muslims from Birmingham to Quetta.

As a young black male I'm sure you must have experienced discrimination based on stereotype.  I would have expected more understanding, but nonetheless..

&gt; I used to be indifferent to them, but over the last few years in Birmingham Muslims have &gt; gotten very aggressive.

Taking you on written value

&gt; I have friends who have been called ""black devils"" by Muslims In the town centre. I have &gt; had Muslims in town telling me how to dress, shouting abuse

Call the police.  Report them. There are laws in place preventing racial abuse. Leverage them. 

&gt; In Birmingham every day they play their f'n prayer music throughout the centre. I do not &gt;want to hear that crap. sorry for the outburst.

Contact the council, there are laws in place to prevent excessive noise

&gt; the hijab or whatever is a big middle finger to western culture, when I see them put &gt; young girls in it I feel sick, stifling the expression of British youth.

How are they _not_ integrating? Everything you've mentioned so far is either attributable to idiots mouthing off or random aspects of their culture and religion.  It doesn't indicate any lack of integration

&gt; I do realise it is not all Muslims, but it is the culture I hate not the people. Islam is just &gt; oppressive, aggressive and barbaric. sorry, why do I feel this way?

There is no ""Muslim"" culture.  There are Azerbajani, Bangladeshi, Pakisatani, British, American, Saudi, Somalian, Kenyan, Indian, etc Muslims.  There is no ""culture"" of Muslims. They span all hues, all cultures. 

If you are indeed a leftie as you purport, and relatively open minded.  Why not take your concerns to a local Imam? I'm sure they will be willing to talk to you to defend their position.

Why not just look at the thorough, independent studies which have shown time and time again that the fluoride levels in tap water are safe and beneficial, instead of grasping at logical fallacies to try and back up your preconceived beliefs? 

Presumably you don't drink tea, seeing as it's very good at absorbing naturally occurring fluoride from the soil and your cuppa may well contain far more fluoride than your glass of fluoridated tap water. Indeed the Chinese used to brush their teeth with green tea, funnily enough. In the UK where they add fluoride, you'll be getting about 0.7-1.2 ppm. A cup of tea could be 9ppm.

Moffat is showrunner, and that means the buck stops with him - especially since the BBC seems to just be writing him blank checks these days.  Moffat is captain of the ship, and if he's allowing bad scripts to be filmed, *that's still HIS responsibility* and no one else's.

&gt;a shore sign that you are talking about politics

Well it's convenient that apparently any opinion that contrasts your own is so easily mocked.

&gt;A nationalistic celebration of heroes who died fighting in a necessary war for our freedom, a complete historical myth that's constructed to serve the interests of the ruling-class today.

Again, you're missing the only small point I was trying to raise. Why when I attempt to talk about the ideas of how people may want to be remembered, do you dismiss it and laugh at the idea that everything isn't politically motivated? If you can't get past that much then this is pretty pointless.

&gt;If you think an official remembrance ceremony lead by the military, royalty, and politicians; those very people who send soldiers to die needlessly in their thousands in the past and today is respectful then you're simply wrong.

Go fuck yourself buddy, ""simply wrong"". Good job I'm talking with the all knowing authority on everything eh? No, *you're* simply wrong. Because my exact point is that it doesn't matter who's remembering. Politicians, you, me, that doesn't matter to the people who are dead. If someone signs up for a combat role, they don't want their actions remembered as ""mistakes"". That's the whole separation issue between being a soldier and being a decision maker. Anyone can get behind a soldier as like it or not, soldiers can and have been there to defend people in righteous circumstances, and you or me may need them tomorrow. If you're too stupid to be able to separate political issues from personal ones then I guess you end up where you are.

&gt;Everything about official remembrance is against remembering how WW1 actual war, it's just a disgusting and cynical display of the immoral depths ruling-class will do to maintain cultural hegemony over a populace and retain support for the nation and the real class struggle it hides.

This is a perfect example of someone who is missing all the points that I made. One can deplore a war and unequivocally support those who fight in it.

What you're not going to do is provide me with any actual evidence Brand's plan has much chance of working, which is what I wanted in the first place.

But if you insist, here is a reasonably good list of examples you might have heard of (I.e. Ignoring Internet arguments where the defence is basically ubiquitous); Tesla and Edison (Edison offered Tesla a prize for inventing AC current, then backed out with the defence - Edison now reviled by history for it), Jack Thompson (offered money to someone to create a game with him in, backed out with the defence - universally reviled), Mary Bale and Justine Sacco (both did horrible things, claimed they were joking, the hatred intensified), PETA (attacked Super Mario Land on the grounds wearing a Tanooki suit promotes wearing fur, faced Internet backlash, claimed they were joking, nobody believed them), Paul Christoforno (?) and Ocean Marketing (did dickish things to organiser of PAX, when he realised what a horrible mistake he'd made attemted the defence which ended *extremely* badly), Ray Comfort (claimed the 'Atheists' Worst Nightmare' video was satire, universally disbelieved), Judy Burchill who wrote a horrible transphobic article and then tried to back out by claiming it was a kind of performance art piece, which nobody believed and got her even more hate. Moving on the comediens specifically, Russell Peter, Micheal Richards, Ricky Gervaise and Andrew Clay have all been accused of this to varying degrees (see, for example, Steward Lee's 'Just a Joke' sketch), though these are less clear cut examples.

In terms of people who have successfully rolled with the punches, people give some examples below. David and Victoria Beckham are a sort-of good example (although they only rolled with the 'you're stupid' jokes, not the ones about David cheating on Victoria). Angus Deyton might be another sort-of example, where he rolled with the punches but still lost his job and reputation (but not perhaps as badly as he might have done). I don't know to what event 'Michael a Winner' refers, and Boris Johnson is a strange example because he does it the opposite way round (makes a joke then apologises in apparent seriousness), but I'll let you have him as an example nonetheless because his entire personality implicitly contributes to the defence and I don't want to engage in special pleading when I've told you that that sort of behaviour is unbecoming (though he is certainly not taken seriously as a heavyweight political thinker!)

I love the way Missy's being played but that whole character made no sense.  I still don't know why did she plant Clara near the doctor - for what exactly? Clara was interesting as the Impossible Girl last season, this season she was basically, well, very bitchy and selfish.  She actually betrayed the doctor while trying to save a guy she's been seeing for a few months, and then killed him a second time because of her own guilt.  Find a way to SAVE THE GUY!

I came back for a few years in my mid twenties and had a great time working in the city. 

However in the last 5 years its started to feel very different, it feels like the city is constantly on edge, like there is a threatening air. From what I know there have been simmering tensions between the black and asian populations for a while now and it feels like it could kick off at any minute.

But in my opinion the recession has a lot to do with this, Birmingham has been hit pretty badly and is not the city is used to be. Rover closing ripped the heart out and since then its just been downhill. Just about everyone I know who worked in Birmingham has left, mostly to London or abroad to Australia. Everyone else seems to have retreated into their communities.

You sound like somebody who's just had bad experiences with Salafis and now want to taint their reputation. All the Salafis I know in the UK are humble and nice people, very strict on their faith indeed but lovely to non-Muslims all the same. They're the last people I would think would turn to radicalism. 

Let's be frank, radicalism is a problem not just affecting pockets of Salafi or Wahabbi communities but all Muslim communities. Generally there is an anti-Western sentiment, and it's largely fuelled by a lack of education and understanding of political affairs combined with the portrayal of Muslims in the media. Young Muslims are seeing Western military intervention in their home countries. Many of these young people are led to believe that they should die to protect their home countries. 

Obama's drone strikes might be taking out some high value targets in Pakistan, but the effect they are having on young Pakistanis around the world means it's fuelling further terrorism. The issue is broader than just a lack of integration. 

All I'd say to OP is, you're not going to visibly notice the Muslims that are integrating and that value British culture.

You can find speeches from Georges Marchais on Youtube, they had the same talking points like the far right, but motivated by reducing figths inside the working class.

The moderate left had more tolerance of immigrarion, but they were not that much pro immigration. The immigration party was the moderate right, as factories needed ever more workers in a time of full employment.

The answer of the moderate right to the rise of unemployment in the 70s was to become anti-immigration (in speeches, not in actions) to attract working class people threatened by low cost immigrants.

The moderate left got caught into feminism, anti-racism and the full tolerance ideology. Before, tolerance was not part of the left. The left thought the working class was the victim as a whole and that progress could only come from unity and class warfare. Multiculturalism was a major threat to class warfare. When people start thinking of themselves as blacks, muslim and more, the idea of the proletarian class disappears. Rich and poor muslims fight for special religious rights, blacks fight the racist lower class (the upper class quickly learned not to speak racist words in public, it was the begining of political correctness in medias).

Soon, feminism, anti-racism stopped being about equal legal rights for all the members of the proletarian class, it became a witch hunt against the patriarchy and racists. And it lead to multiculturalism, every small group began lobbying for special interests.

What we call white guilt is the result of this. Working class white males have no one to lobby for their interests, they are accused by the feminists of being machist, by the anti-racists of being racists, by the LGBT of being homophobic, by the muslims of being islamophobic, by the employed of being lazy parasites if unemployed, by the mondialists of being xenophobic.

The fact is that, all other things being equal, it's better to be working than to be on benefits. Therefore blaming the benefits system itself for people being on benefits is incorrect.

The mainstream parties are too tied up in being politically correct to take a stand on this: they don't want to be seen as oppressing someone's culture.

Well thank you for pre-determining the course of this argument you internet-Calvinist you!

I fail to see what would be wrong with my discounting your examples. Your comment history on here would make it appear that you like to debate on plenty of issues, so surely if you make a point you should be prepared to back it up. My 'shifting the burden of proof' was asking you to back up a generalisation you made. You've now done that and been a dick about it to top it off.

That's a pretty mature attitude you have there, goes nicely with all the big boy words you use.

In terms of actual evidence for Brand's plan *working*, there is none. Whether or not someone's 'roll with the punches' defence has worked or not is entirely subjective. You might have written him off, but the fact that you're getting downvoted, along with the fairly positive response I've seen to the video so far suggests that the defence isn't automatically doomed to failure just because you say so.

&gt;“In effect, Britain First is the far-right version of al-Muhajiroun, the Islamist group led by Anjem Choudary.

http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/hate-groups/bf/

&gt;Britain First is only recently a registered political party. Previously it used the name “National People’s Party”, before deciding to register the Britain First name.

&gt;BF claim it is not a racist or fascist organisation, yet it propagandises on the traditional far-right issues of Islam, immigration and abortion. It encourages its members to carry out actions like mass emailing and letter writing in a campaign to “Put Britons First”, which the organisation appears to define as anyone who is Christian. So far, it claims that over thirty thousand “actions” have been taken.

&gt;The BF is closely aligned with the black-led organisation the “Christian People’s Party”, which also had a small dalliance with the BNP when Dowson was fundraising for them.

false,crunchydiodes,null,null,"&gt; I do realise it is not all Muslims, but it is the culture I hate not the people. Islam is just oppressive, aggressive and barbaric. sorry, why do I feel this way?

You feel that way because some people (who happened to be muslim) have been doing things that piss you off.  You're drawing the wrong conclusion by extending your dislike to muslim culture in general.

Go to somewhere like Tunisia, Turkey or Malaysia, where moderate Islam is the norm, and just walk down the street.  You'll notice that everyone is pretty much acting normal.

There are other muslim countries (Saudi being the best known) where there is very little freedom, and the religion is used as a stick to beat any anti-regime people with.  However, muslims don't have a monopoly on this kind of thing.  A good comparison today would be with Russia: rampant homophobia, xenophobia, lack of democratic freedom.  But Russia's not a muslim country... so there must be some mechanism other than religion that creates those kind of negative characteristics in a culture.

&gt; the hijab or whatever

You've got to be more specific than this.  There's nothing anti-british about a headscarf, the bloody queen wears a headscarf routinely.  I imagine you're probably more objecting to full face veils, which are broadly unpopular.  But adopting a negative view of everyone in a headscarf (or all muslims) because of veils... there's just no logic in that at all.

&gt; I have friends who have been called ""black devils"" by Muslims In the town centre.

Turn this around.  Imagine you're a british indian person who gets ""paki"" yelled at him in the street by white british people.  Would you be on reddit saying ""I'm a leftie who is starting to dislike British culture, it doesn't fit in with British values""?  No, because it would be absolute nonsense: the problem is the people yelling racist abuse, not the race or religion that they were born into.

Basically, *just stop generalising*.  When someone does something you don't like, instead of thinking ""bloody muslims"", think ""what a dick"".  All cultures have their fair share of dicks, you've just met some of the muslim ones and drawn the wrong conclusion.

Game 39 is guaranteed to introduce unfairness to the Premier League, and mustn't become part of it.

Instead of Game 39, it has been proposed that you could take random fixtures from the 38 and play them abroad. The certainty of unfairness with regard to travel distances remains, and is compounded by the fact that half of the teams will lose a home advantage, and half will lose an away disadvantage.

I think you may have misunderstood how religion works... Not just Islam but all religion. Childhood indoctrination is the cornerstone of religion. You're basically implying it doesn't happen and that children can make informed decisions and that those decisions are not going to be heavily swayed by their parents.

Let's take Islam out of the equation and use Christianity as an example, to quell the notion that what I'm about to say is anti-Islam. I will be using the collective 'Your' and 'you'.

Your parents are devout Christians (Catholic). They always wear a cross, go to church multiple times a week and observe all the religious holidays and sacraments. As a child, you're taken to church with them, christened, give confession, etc. and are taught that it's all absolutely true. Your parents are your guides in early life. If they say it is true, it must be so.

Now apply, that to Islam. Mum always wears the hijab and you've been taught that this is correct and it would be wrong not to. So, if you 'choose' to wear it, is that really a choice?

The point is any **Referendum on EU membership == Political Choice** not an economic choice via EEA Treaty with EFTA.

The CBI conflates Single Market access with Political union to create a false choice for te UK public.

Do you not believe that? Well trust the Norwegian people 4/5's o whom reject EU membership. Or Swiss where minimum against EU membership has been 79% - minimum.

It's a political choice concerning democracy and sovereignty.

If you are scared of economics well in te latest prosperity rating Norway and Switzerland came 2nd and 1st. Compare to EZ.

They apparently don't have much influence on EU policy but that is not true, compare UK lack of influence in the EU:

1. UK Percentage of the Vote in the Council of Ministers under QMV = 8.2% (down from 17 in 1973)
2. The Number and UK Percentage of the Vote in the European Parliament = 73/751 ; (down from 19%-9.7%)
3. Number and Percentage of UK commissioners: 1 (down from 2), 3.6 (%)

So we can clearly see the low/lack of influence in the EU and the Swiss and Norwegians KNOW this. Via EFTA they have multiple methods of influencing policy before it even comes to vote.

Only Pro-EU's talk up our influence (but all the delays, indecision and disagreements consequently conflicts with this position as evidently observable!) and talk down the alternative real choices of democracy as ""Fax Democracy"": The Norwegian people are very very happy with such ""Fax Democracy"" via EEA/EFFA full access to the Songle Market. Compare the unhappy people in te EZ particularly the GIIPS who are losing more policy powers towards Federalization via Banking Union plans. 

So even the UK as Non-EURO member is losing more influence staying in the EU as it tries to rescue the failing EZ.

1. the personal problem of not being able to afford to live (this means you need to get a better job or reduce your expenses). not easy but it is ultimately on the individual to sort your situation out.

2. the systemic problem where a whole class is squeezed - we have to accept, whether we believe in a meritocracy or not, that at any given point in time some people won't be wealthy - maybe they're starting out or maybe they've had a setback or maybe they're just not in a job that rewards them financially. So we can decide whether the absence of wealth makes life absolutely miserable, or if we want it to be bearable. Obviously with the way we treat people on benefits, there's a lot of people who want it to be miserable.

We can't solve the problem where people haven't got promoted yet, that's on them to work harder, work longer, and work better than their colleagues.

My family have been in Birmingham since pre-peaky blinders time, so I have heard many stories of the changing faces of the city. 

I wasn't trying to equate Birmingham to Detroit but the city has changed over the past 15 years, you can't deny Birmingham has been adversely affected by the recession. I worked for one of the biggest engineering firms in the country and when the recession hit they went from three floors of people to one in their Birmingham office, as infrastructure and building projects were scrapped all over the west midlands. One of Birmingham issues has been that as industry has moved out, the city has relied on the public sector for employment, which has meant austerity has had a harder impact than in other places. 

I'd admit it has picked up slightly in the past year or so, with development restarting. But by just taking a walk through the city centre and comparing it to how it felt around the millennium, when the bull ring and the mail box opened, and new street was full of shops you can see how much its changed. The city that felt like it was on the up, and had so much optimism for the future has stalled. 

In its defence there are some lovely areas of the city, and its still has the best schools in the country. I'd live there but theres no work for me or my partner. And as much as it pains me to say it, other city centres like Manchester, Newcastle or Bristol are far more appealing.

retort to his statements, what?

&gt; No this is an entire section in his book (have you read it?).

I haven't read his book. I'm not pretending I have read his book. I don't worship the man - you are getting very ridiculous... not only are you attempting to put words in my mouth you are setting up straw men representing my personal take and then proceeding to dismantle them.

&gt; So you admit that you don't understand banking or quantitive easing?

First mention of quantitative easing in this discussion between you and me - I understand it perfectly and it's a made-up term by Gordon Brown to keep people from going into panic by simply referring to it as printing money - see the Weimar Republic 1923 for reference.

&gt; Quantitive Easing is governments issuing more credit - it has nothing to do with a bank thats too big to fail. It's like saying ""credit card post office"".

Fucking hell you are one patronising SOB.

&gt; If it's ""a con"" why does he repeatedly talk about way to ""stimulating the economy"" in his book. I suspected you'd fall for that one.

Yep - never read the book, do not intend to as I'm not really so obsessed with Russel Brand that I can continue to berate people online who only express a passing interest in his YouTube channel.

&gt; You know nothing at all of Spanish history then?

Should I? I think I know enough to get by - I'm not a historian and neither my job nor any of my interests require I know a great deal about it.

&gt; But if an A level student handed this in as a paper to me I'd have a one-2-one with them and ask it they had an angry uncle at home.

Apparently it's not an A-Level paper though is it, it's a book. Similarly I'm not trying to write an A-Level paper and I really couldn't give a shit.

&gt; I didn't. I really didn't.
&gt;&gt; To quote you you said

Do you see a ""?"" at the end of that sentence? Did you notice the inclusion of the qualifier ""seems to"" at the beginning of my statement?

I didn't ask for a fucking lecture or examples.

&gt; Ironically Brand lists several of these in his book. It's ironic you miss this.

It's not ironic if I'm making no attempt to defend Russel Brand, I haven't read his book and I have in no way professed to read his book, reference it, or defend it.

Your aggressive assertions however, are ironic.

&gt; You're typical of his audience who are so disengaged in politics that your own laziness is now a point for discussion.

Now you are getting personal and making assumptions which has annoyed me and is the reason for my offensive tone above.

You know nothing about me or whether I have voted, what experience I have in community work or political activism and yet from the fact I've expressed I don't care about some aspect of something Russel Brand has said - I'm a lazy, disengaged, unemployed, dole-dosser.

I'm trying my best to restrain myself and not to heap on my own insults directed at you... and the only thing that's keeping me from doing so is the knowledge of how idiotic and wide-of-the-mark your assumption is.

&gt; The reason why you're disengaged in politics is because your life is so comfortable. You have supercomputing smartphones with the entire worlds' knowledge, free mass world wide communication, millions of hours of entertainment, choice and more choice of millions of consumable objects for £1 and under, free regulated advice on health, politics, IT, birdwatching and sex, access to celebrities, politicians and daredevils with a tweet on every subject imaginable via free monetary systems and trillion dollar space programs looking in to the depths of the universe with the latest scientific research sent to you in digested formats all dripping from a tiny device that fits in your pocket for £15 a month - even if you're unemployed and on the dole and yet... somehow... capitalism has failed us all.

&gt; its a global team in a global league. I

In the UK, we definitely do not see this as ""a global league"" - it's the English league and we're surprised that a couple of Welsh teams have been allowed to play in it. We've laughed long and hard at the idea that the Old Firm clubs be admitted. It's the English league.

Then we have the Champions' League, which is European, but there isn't a global league.

The fact that foreigners choose to watch our league is up to them. That's just how it's seen in the UK. I've lived in the USA too, and the American LFC fans I know are just just as passionate, committed, loyal as any scouser. I don't feel that gives them any ownership over the English Premier League. I think it's good that the club rewards their support (and milks them for cash) by visiting in the off season but that's Liverpool's business, not the FA's.

&gt;  I'd say the majority of LFC fans aren't even scouse, or at least a large chunk are not. LFC games are broadcast all over, it doesn't make them Vancouver FC just because I watch them here?

No but think about your logic. Why do you watch one particular team in the English league rather than just consuming whatever soccer is on? Because that team has an identity based on its history and the place where it originated. It's Anfield and the fans who go thare, and the fans who go to *every* away game not just once a year that make Liverpool distinct from Chelsea or Man Utd.

&gt; The NFL, NBA teams do this, they don't lose their authenticity?

Yes, they lose their authenticity in the eyes of people in the UK. We look at American sports. We know about the Brooklyn Dodgers but who are these characters in LA? Is it the same club or not? (Answer: not). How 'authentic' are of the  ~~Chicago~~ ~~St. Louis~~ Arizona Cardinals? Proud founder members of the league or something new? Do people in their 40s from St Louis root for the Cardinals or the ~~Cleveland~~ ~~LA~~ St Louis Rams? Or do they find it hard to care?

American sports franchises have to have location-independent names, be it Dodgers or Raiders or Grizzlies, because you never know where they will pop up next.

English football teams, with very few exception, have names that reflect the communities that they are a part of and the history that makes them what they are. That's why English people laugh at 'Hull Tigers' and 'Cardiff Dragons' when it happens to other teams, rebel when it happens to their own, and nobody likes 'MK Dons'.

Remember we live in a small country, and significant numbers of supporters travel to away games. Football fixtures are a part of the social fabric of England.

EDIT:

Think about the way college football arguably has more sincere and committed support in the US than the NFL does. It's more closely rooted in local communities than NFL franchises (but still not to the same extent as English football).",0,1415703532,null,0,1415716259,0,clzampp,t3_2lxkgh,t1_clzampp,t1_clz541h,null,1426081637,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

My only problem now is that I have very irregular skin, especially around my chin, which has lots of noticeable white-ish bumps on it (it looks like I have a chin full of tiny marbles!). I'm guessing it might be clogged pores or something?

I was thinking of introducing an AHA or BHA into my routine, but I don't know which to go for - BHAs sound like a better for sensitive skin, but maybe AHAs are more effective? I'm on a restricted budget so are there any cheap but effective products you'd recommend? (I have looked at the AHA BHA mega-thread, so I have some idea, but I'm still feeling a bit overwhelmed)

Most important thing is, as lots of other people have said, the survey. We withdrew an offer on another property when it came back, because there were some structural problems that weren't obvious to the naked eye. Also make sure your solicitor checks planning permissions in the area (they normally do) as somewhere we liked the look of had a nice back garden, which is now overlooked by a block of apartments that weren't there when we were looking!

We were first time buyers, so there wasn't a long chain, but we still had to wait for the other owners to complete after their first choice fell through, so be prepared for that. Once we were agreed, we had the keys in 5 weeks.

Also, with mortages, do some serious shopping around. Danske offer good rates but they won't offer you a mortage in principle, which means you need to get them to agree a mortage each time you make an offer, which is a nuisance. Ulster do longer mortages if you want to pay a lower monthly rate for a longer time but that of course means you'll pay more overall. 

You'll probably know within 5 minutes if you want to live somewhere. Do not hang around- with the market as it is, prices will creep up very quickly, and if a property seems nice to you and is affordable, then you run the risk of being drawn into a bidding war if you don't make a move. That's not to say just throw your money at the first house you see, just that if somewhere feels rightl; go for it.

Also, no matter where it is or what state it's in, your new property will be a massive black hole at the centre of your life. You will constantly by funnelling money, time and effort into it, even if it's a new build. This is (I'm told) perfectly normal and happens to everyone.

false,Firefox7275,null,null,"Lactic acid and urea are the gentlest chemicals, both are found in healthy skin and both moisturise as they exfoliate. Lactic acid is the largest molecule of the AHAs which means it penetrates less deeply compared with small molecule glycolic. At low percentages it can also boost ceramide synthesis. Urea you will find in moistirisers such as Eucerin or NSPA Ultra Hydrate - it doesn't need an acidic pH.

BHA (salicylic acid) also has anti inflammatory properties, BUT it can be hugely drying. I can't go there at all. Apparently mandelic acid is a decent compromise, it's technically an AHA but with some aspects in common with BHAs.

In general AHAs are supposedly better for closed comedones and BHAs for blackheads and sebaceous filaments, but I think the skin type is more important (how easily irritated/ dehydrated). IMO go for an AHA, you are doing a fair bit of drying out of your skin already (face wash, BP).

Don't feel you have to use it daily, and don't feel you have to exfoliate all your face every time: my nose/ mouth/ chin area is more sensitive and more easily over exfoliated than my forehead and outer cheeks so sometimes I skip that area.

No it doesn't - you're conflating the public school system and religious status recognition with what I'm allowed to say and teach my own children. I might be obliged to enrolled my children into the public school system (which are themselves very broad btw), but I'm also free to teach them any value I see fit, and I can achieve this end however I see fit (within the rule of law, of-course). 

If I want to teach them we're all subject to the spaghetti monster floating in the sky, or that the coming of Luke Skywalker will herald the rapture, that's my business. This is not universally the case, and I would be tried and convicted of blasphemy in many parts of the world.

I'd take issue with the idea that CofE is ""promoted in most schools"" ... but, sidestepping this ... where and when did this become a discussion about Christianity? Are you implying that British values are intrinsically tied to Christian values, and *that's* the real cause of the tension being outlined in this thread? Would it be of any surprise that Christianity rejected Islam? And, further, if Christianity's contention with Islam revolved around gender, orientation, political freedoms and equality, is this meant to be a negative thing? 

Yes, there are tight regulations - this is far from some utopian paradise ... but the regulations that protect one protect all (at-least, in theory). Pointing to the house of lords seems ... ridiculous to me, tbh ... Sure, there are Bishops sitting in the HoL (all 26 out of over 800) but, like it or not this *is* a Christian country, and some representation of that fact doesn't then mean discrimination. Our present multi-cultural society is a relatively recent phenomenon, whilst our system of government is centuries old. It will adapt but it will do so in as stable a transition as possible - is it yet necessary? As itnstands, all faiths can vote and all faiths can participate in our electoral process ... again, this is not universally true. *This* is political freedom.

false,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I look at your post and all these comments and I feel so disappointed with people sometimes. You take your unfortunate experiences with a group of assholes and generalise it over all the other people who happen to share the same religion. Are you not able to distinguish a person's asshole personality from their race/religion/sex?

You said it yourself: ""it is not all Muslims"". I'm willing to bet that it isn't *only* Muslims either who have been an asshole to you at some point in your life. Have you never been poorly treated by a Christian or a Jew? Or is it just that you didn't think about/know the religion of those people, only the Muslims? If being Muslim is neither necessary nor sufficient to be a jerk, then how do you conclude that it is due to their religion that they are a jerk, or that being a Muslim is an indicator of being a jerk?

Furthermore, Muslims make up over 1/5th of the entire Earth's population. Islam is a religion, not a culture, with believers from almost every corner of the world. The religion itself is also fragmented into different types, Sunni and Shia to name just a couple of big ones. All these Muslims may share some core beliefs and rules like not eating pork and praying at a mosque, but they differ vastly in specifics and culture. As much as a British Christian like yourself (I'm assuming you are somewhat religious. If not, then consider an average Church of England follower) differs to an American evangelical Christian who believes in faith healing and creationism, or to a Nigerian Christian who uses the disgusting practice of female genital mutilation ([actually more prevalent amongst Christians in Nigeria than Muslims](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507121/)). You share the same religion with both of these real life examples, but how would you like to be grouped in with them?

My point is not to defend the poor practices of certain groups of people. My point is that you need to take a step back and think for yourself, are your experiences and observations of Muslims as a whole? Or are they of a small subset of Muslims with a specific culture (take for example, 2nd generation immigrants, newly affluent middle class from South Asia, now residing in Birmingham City Centre)? Or are they even of Muslims at all? Think about this before you continue down the path of disliking an entire religion or people from that religion.

Finally, to address your complaints about the call to prayer and the hijab. The call to prayer is not sounded at unsociable hours, just like anything else that is noisy. A lab at my university makes a huge amount of noise two or three times a day during working hours because they run jet engine experiments. If you have problem with it, either because it is too loud or at a bad time, complain to the council about it, just as you would complain about noisy neighbours or construction.

The hijab is merely an article of clothing (just to be clear, the hijab is the head scarf that covers the hair, not the full face mask thing). Your immediate assumption that all girls wearing the hijab must be oppressed in some way is ridiculous. Some may be forced into it yes, and that's not ok. But most wear it voluntarily because they believe in it, and who are you to say that they shouldn't? How does it affect you in anyway if someone chooses to cover (or not cover) their hair, or their arms or their legs?

But the political choice has an economic impact, and ignoring this is incredibly naive.

In honesty it might as well be an economic choice, as i said before political uncertainty leads to economic uncertainty, and economic uncertainty means less investment and speculative trading.

&gt; The CBI conflates Single Market access with Political union to create a false choice for te UK public.

Yes it does and i agree it is misleading, but i also feel that it is hard to explain these complex trade agreements and different levels of EU to the layman. As well as this the anti-EU side is full of misinformation about the EU, how it works; and its effects on us.

The 55m a day figure leaves out the subsidies we are re-imbursed with.

The 75% of laws made in brussels is a misquoted out of context reference, the real figure is closer to 15%.

The EU being undemocratic stems from the misunderstanding that elected representatives arent representative and that executive power is held solely by the commission. Both are wrong.

&gt; Well trust the Norwegian people 4/5's o whom reject EU membership. Or Swiss where minimum against EU membership has been 79% - minimum.

Well the EU has 28 nations in it, so going by your logic, the majority of European nations want to be in the EU? I dont really understand this point, why is it relevant what other countries voted?

&gt; It's a political choice concerning democracy and sovereignty.

and political choices, regardless of how you feel; influence the economies of those involved massively.

Do you know what speculative trading is? Do you know what investment is?

&gt; If you are scared of economics

lolwut

&gt; well in te latest prosperity rating Norway and Switzerland came 2nd and 1st. Compare to EZ.

Of any developed nation, the UK has the best growth rate; going by your same logic we should therefore remain in the EU.

I am really baffled by your insistence to compare the UK to much smaller and pretty negligible countries. They are not comparable at all.

&gt; UK Percentage of the Vote in the Council of Ministers under QMV = 8.2% (down from 17 in 1973) 2. The Number and UK Percentage of the Vote in the European Parliament = 73/751 ; (down from 19%-9.7%) 3. Number and Percentage of UK commissioners: 1 (down from 2), 3.6 (%)

Do you mean to tell me that, as the EU has gotten bigger and more countries are eligible to  vote (THATS CALLED DEMOCRACY) the UKs vote means less than it did when we first joined?

wow, that seems like a very reasonable course of action to me. Do you think the UK should have all the votes? You realise thats called a dictatorship right?

Well now that weve cleared up your misconception of the UKs reducing influence (it reduces as the EU gets bigger, just as it should) lets take a look at the policies and objectives that the UK has tried to achieve shall we?

&gt;[ London was on track to meet nine out of 10 of its EU policy goals and was a force to be reckoned with in the 28-nation bloc.](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/01/30/uk-britain-eu-idUKBREA0T18O20140130)

Further

&gt; Britain's progress across a range of EU policies in 2013, showed London had been successful in 20 areas and failed in only four.

-

&gt; Via EFTA they have multiple methods of influencing policy before it even comes to vote.

Care to share any of those methods?

&gt; Only Pro-EU's talk up our influence 

Only anti-EU's talk down our influence........................... is this supposed to be an argument?

&gt; (but all the delays, indecision and disagreements consequently conflicts with this position as evidently observable!

The EU is an institution that effects **700 million people**, it is the single largest economic bloc on the planet; and you want them to rush decisions? Yes the EU is slow, but its also calculating. Yes the EU is lumbering, but its moving towards the right direction.

On a continent that has been the start of two world wars (the UK played its part in both) the European project has brought unprecedented peace to this continent. But this resurgent nationalism has blinded people, they have forgotten the horrors of what happens when large developed countries disagree, and there is no legal mechanism to mediate between them. This is just one of the many reasons i am pro-EU.

The fact is that it is one of the few global institutions that truly promotes freedom of expression, democracy and human rights all across the world, encouraging countries to become more liberal and progressive. Moving them towards democracy, free market capitalism, transparency and human rights.

&gt; Compare the unhappy people in te EZ particularly the GIIPS.

You do know that the UK isnt actually in the EZ right? I mean, if we where i would want to leave ASAP. but from where i am standing we are the single country that is gaining the most out of being in the EU. You might think its Germany, but check their growth (both population and economic). When the UKs economy stops doing so well and the EU actually becomes undemocratic (if you want i can explain how it works to you) then ill be all for leaving.

&gt;""He asked what he had been condemned for. It was for abandoning his post. The General then began to talk to the man. Quite simply, he explained discipline to him. Abandoning your post was letting down your pals; more, it was letting down your country that looked to you to defend her. He spoke of the necessity of example, how some could do their duty without prompting but others, less strong, had to know and understand the supreme cost of failure. He told the condemned man that his crime was not venial, not low, and that he must die as an example, so that others should not fail. Surprisingly, the wretch agreed, nodding his head. He saw a glimmer of something, redemption in his own eyes, a real hope, though he knew he was about to die. Maud'huy went on, carrying the man with him to comprehension that any sacrifice was worthwhile while it helped France ever so little. What did anything matter if he knew this?

It is up to the people to **DECIDE** on those choices.

But first we need to all reach a point where we have actually identified the real choices vs the false choices. And you are correct Morgan: public perception and UKIP are both not good guides to which choices are realistic.

I think in theory EEA might not be as big a problem. There is something that is overlooked in these debates and that is the way common law works. In theory the EEA four freedoms are obviously different to the EU four freedoms because of context despite being equivalent in language. However our common law norm will leave judges treating the EEA exactly the same as the EU status quo. It seems to me absurd to think a judge will look at a law we've already ruled on and come up with different judgements due to external factors.

Regardless I think it is a debate over relatively minor details. With the EEA we will be agreeing to large quantities of immigration. With the EU we will be agreeing to large quantities of immigration. The specifics of how large a large quantity is won't satisfy the public IMO.

I stand by my position that there are two separate issues. Political sovereignty and immigration. We can achieve the former by essentially associating with the EU via the EEA. The latter requires a complete withdrawal and renegotiation from outside.

No. In the run-up to the last general election, the debates were billed as ""party leader"" debates, not ""prime ministerial"" debates. [The same is true this time around](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/leader-debates).

&gt;*the whole purpose of these television debates is that you get to hear your potential prime minister speak on issues.*

Not the case. Otherwise, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage, who have literally no chance of becoming PM after the general election, would not be anywhere near the debates. Only two individuals - the leaders of the Labour and Conservative parties - have a chance of becoming PM after the next election, and the broadcasters themselves have acknowledged this, arranging for ""*One head-to-head debate between the two leaders who could become Prime Minister – Conservative and Labour.*"" If you want to refer to any of the Leaders' debates as ""Prime Ministerial"", then this is the one. The others are not by any objective criterion.

The purpose of the debates is for the party leaders to set out their stalls to a televised audience, nothing more.
&gt; is the SNP or Plaid putting up a candidate for prime minister? no they are not.

Correct.

&gt; are the greens? yes they are.

No they are not. Parties do not put forward candidates for the position of PM at general elections.

false,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"It is a mistake to view Saudi Arabia as having a single monolithic power structure. It's a more complicated place than that.

When King Abdullahs family came to power, they struck a deal with the Wahabbist fundamentalists. This means that both groups control a lot of power in the country, but they are distinct from eachother.

The Saudi royal family are not religious fundamentalists. That's why they are quite happy to send their young to London to gamble and cavort with the best of them. But they have to maintain good relations with the Wahabbis.

Furthermore, back in the 1970s, a deal was struck between the Saudis and the Americans, basically along the lines of ""you keep the oil flowing, and we're protect your arses"" (the deal was a bit more complex than that, but that was part of it). That's one of the reasons why there's so many US bases in Saudi Arabia, and it's the main reason why Al Qaeda views the US as a primary target - it needs to destabilise the US before it can create a revolution in it's home country, Saudi Arabia.

So there's really two alliances going on in Saudi. An alliance between the royal family and the Wahabbis and an alliance between the state (=the royal family) and the Americans.

The real irony of rest of your post is the true beauty in your next point, which is actually entirely backwards to what needs to be done.

In order to make work less miserable at NMW levels, you **first** need to make the **below** (read: welfare, lets not mince our words) less miserable, so people will cease to operate in the labor force until conditions improve.  The market will only improve if conditions force it to do so - it will not pay people better, or treat them better *because its nice* it gives no shits whats nice.  It just wants your labor to make its goods so it can make profit.

The real problem is, peoples choice right now at the NMW levels are - be employed and poor, or be unemployed and poor.

Not a huge difference in life except in one you have to deal with a shitty boss, in a shitty company who gives no shits about you because it can replace you in the blink of an eye.

You want work conditions to improve at NMW levels, give your labor force some god damn bargaining power (which we have categorically been eroding for nearly a century now) where there only choices are:

* be stuck in welfare poverty
* be stuck in work poverty
* die

Although correlation =/= causation, atheist leaders generally don't use their atheism as justification.

but just adding an extra game into it, where some teams will play difficult opponents, and others will play easy ones is totally unfair. Plus home advantage for smaller teams with less of an international following will be more or less nonexistant - the crowds will flock to United/Liverpool/Arsenal/Chelsea, and a team like Stoke or Burnley will just be losing a home game.

The only way I can see a workable solution is to have some kind of cup competition with the premier league teams, that is played entirely in another country. That would have its own problems (20 teams doesn't go into knockout form, it would have to be the top 16 or something), plus finding the time for extra games, and also whether teams take it seriously.

It makes people feel as if they have expressed their political rights and made a slight difference in the outcome of government.

But in reality, voting does nothing compared to corporations lobbying government with disgusting amounts of money that have more sway with a party than anything else.

Because money wins elections.

Therefore, voting is a useless exercise within Britain, as the current political system serves a rich elite rather than normal people who exercise their vote.

However, if enough people choose to not vote, and the turnout is extremely low, this will have a much larger impact upon society than actually voting.

But insisting we play out from the back *No matter what* was just suicidal, Garry hasnt abandoned that, but when in doubt, clear the lines.  And at a certain point I think he got fed up because no one was as good as him as a player, and simply just stopped giving a  shit. I also think he had a bit of a cup competition fetish, and put more thought in to those than the league. And also he didn't really try and put in the sort of togetherness Garry is trying (And succeeding) to put in to the team, speaking Spanish to non-English speakers, and english to those who could, created such a rift in the team that it was as if there were two different teams on the field, and that if they worked together it was pure coincidence. 

At first I was skeptical over Huw's decision, but based on this showing, in Garry we trust, he didnt need super-star status to bring in a bunch of players that not only filled the hole that was left by the spanish group, but honestly I think we're better as a team.

I was sad to see De Guzman go, and I do hope he returns some day, he's left a bit of a hole in our play, but as for the rest of the people Laudrup brought in that left?

Chico - A loose cannon is an understatement

Hernandez - Good on his day, non-existent when he wasn't.

Vasquez - I feel bad for him, lots of potential, it just didn't click

Canas - Yeah he was good but I'm not losing sleep over him not being in the squad

Pozuelo - Again good, it just didnt quite work.

Get rid of Rose. I'm sorry but he loses the ball nearly every touch, you need composure in a fullback. Get someone like Ryan Bertrand.

Comparable to does not mean same as. The British Empire's history of internment and the use of concentration camps is obviously comparable to the Nazis use of the same ideas.

That is a lie. I explicitly compared the BE to the Nazis, not the other way around. There is a clear argument being made, you shouldn't insert different arguments in its place.

The argument you've used against inclusion of the SNP and Plaid holds a lot more water. I wouldn't say that it is watertight, however, because similar concerns arise out of the current format of the debates. To viewers in Wales and Scotland, whether they are aware of the fact or not, most of the content of the debates will be irrelevant, as most domestic policy areas are these days the preserve of the devolved administrations. Simultaneously, a significant part of the population of both countries will not be afforded the chance to see their favoured party's leader speak on the same platform as the others. In Northern Ireland, the situation is even more profound, as almost all of the parties involved in the leader's debates don't even go so far as to field candidates there. 

To me, the only way to ""fix"" the leader's debates would be to stop pretending that we can have a single national debate. The politics of the four constituent parts of the UK are now so divergent that the only way we could give each party a fair showing would be to restrict broadcasting of the so-called ""national"" debates to England (with candidates from Labour, the Conservatives, the Lib Dems, UKIP and the Greens) and host separate debates for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 

The current system, where additional debates are provided for the smaller nations of the UK, does not really work because they are inevitably overshadowed by the national debates, leading to concerns that the results of the elections are being affected unfairly due to the unequal showing that each of the parties get on the TV.

&gt;Christianity is not w/o fault ... but, in 'its' defence **(at-least in the UK / CoE)** it has abandoned aspirations for governance and is satisfied with separation from State. Yes - homophobes should be run out of office. Yes - the church should be broken up if it holds discriminatory values (as the Anglican Church is experiencing wrt female and to gay ordination)

So you can say something is specifically about the UK's CoE Christian traditions but the OP isn't allowed to do the same with regards to Wahhabism? By your rules this is a the same fallacy you are accusing the OP of. 

Point being that you limited your argument to a subset you can defend because you undoubtedly understand that if you didn't you'd open the door to allow me to conflate your point with how,say, since the 1980's politics in the USA has been increasingly dictated by far right wing conservative Christian groups some of which follow batshit crazy ideas like [Dominionism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Theology) a dominition that is very likely to have a memeber (who was annoited a ""king"" by his paster father) credibly run for precident in 2016 in the form of Ted Cruz. However that that is happening in the USA does not mean it has to happen in the CoE and that is largely the point being made above.

Now to your actual point our head of state is still the head of the Church and we have seats in our second house reserved for the state clergy and while it's easy to hand wave that away with the idea that the church largely chooses to stay out of our politics this is simply a tradition and traditions can very quickly change in the right circumstance.

Atheists don't have leaders. Aside from that, the fact that Dawkins and Harris might or might not be sexist is totally irrelevant. I was an atheist long before I heard of these people. Someone being 'turned away from atheism' because Harris or Dawkins said some deeply sexist shit is an utterly bizarre concept. Atheism isn't a church. It isn't a religion. It isn't an organisation. I can't even wrap my mind around what the writer is trying to say here.

&gt; That Shermer had taken her to his room while she was too drunk to consent to sex and had sex with her anyway.

I'm going to tread lightly but I still want to make my point. I hate the reasoning behind this statement. If a person is passed out drunk and has given no consent, you should not have sex with them. We can all agree on that. But if a person is drunk and wants sex, that's different. I personally lost my virginity whilst both me and the other person were totally shitfaced on cheap vodka.

Was Shermer drunk? That's not mentioned. If he was, is that different? Did he force her to his room or did she go willingly? I think these are important questions. People will try and claim I'm victim blaming, but I'm not. I'd say that a lot of people have consensual sex whilst drunk. I think that's a safe statement. Now, if a person regrets it the next day, does that mean they have grounds to claim rape? What if the man is drunk and the woman sober? Are people supposed to only ever have sex sober?

How so? Regardless of the bickering over which of the smaller parties should be included, it will be one of the big three (and obviously going to be Cameron/Miliband) who becomes PM? 

People vote for parties and leaders, regardless of if they are really voting for some nameless faceless MP. A lot of people probably can't tell you their MP, but they could tell you which party they voted for and who leads it.

&gt; To viewers in Wales and Scotland, whether they are aware of the fact or not, most of the content of the debates will be irrelevant, as most domestic policy areas are these days the preserve of the devolved administrations. 

And the smaller parties in Wales and Scotland will never hold significant power in Westminster, so what's the problem here? There is no reason for them to talk about UK wide issues in a UK wide debate as they will never be in a position to act on them.

The larger UK wide parties could eventually get to that position.

&gt; In Northern Ireland, the situation is even more profound, as almost all of the parties involved in the leader's debates don't even go so far as to field candidates there. 

And they'll presumably get their own debate. Again, there's no reason to put the DUP leader on the same stage as Cameron to be shown to all 63 million people. I can't and will never be able to vote for the DUP, along with most of the UK, so couldn't give a toss what they have to say.

&gt; To me, the only way to ""fix"" the leader's debates would be to stop pretending that we can have a single national debate. The politics of the four constituent parts of the UK are now so divergent that the only way we could give each party a fair showing would be to restrict broadcasting of the so-called ""national"" debates to England (with candidates from Labour, the Conservatives, the Lib Dems, UKIP and the Greens) and host separate debates for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 

Why ""England""? It's not one unified bloc where all 53 million people agree with each other. Are the regions of England less deserving of their own debates? 

&gt; The current system, where additional debates are provided for the smaller nations of the UK, does not really work because they are inevitably overshadowed by the national debates, leading to concerns that the results of the elections are being affected unfairly due to the unequal showing that each of the parties get on the TV.

There is nothing untoward or baffling about the fact that soldiers who did not do their jobs were punished according to the laws of the time--as many others have pointed out, the only thing that's surprising is that only 300 or so were shot out of an army which at its height numbered 6 million.

The lingering conservative political ideology is such that some politicians and people believe we shouldn't pay the government or even have a government to provide public services, because 'taxes are our hard earned cash', so why don't we tell those politicians that they **can** shutdown government - then there will be no budgets to cut any further. Then we can start a new government with a clean slate, proper representation and democratic elections. We can introduce laws to prevent the pervasive actions of lobbying, enforce competition rules, and provide secure and efficient basic services such as education, health and utilities. 

They seem dead set of breaking down the infrastructure that supports us bit by bit so why not let them burn it down all in one go. Sure it's drastic and a lot of people will die and suffer during the flux period but I'm sure we'll make it through as a society.

Wilhelm advocated a ""regular international all-worlds pogrom à la Russe"" as ""the best cure"" and further believed that Jews were a ""nuisance that humanity must get rid of some way or other. I believe the best thing would be gas!  (Röhl (1994) p. 210)

I'm sure this woman who has lived in a house with her daughter probably wont be able to travel as light as me, so she'll probably need a proper removals team/van and thus incur additional charges I didn't have too.

&gt; It is a political choice = Socereignty of representation of policy powers by demos.

No, its a political and economic choice.

Again, any decent economist can tell you that political uncertainty means economic uncertainty, its 101 of economics. How youve managed to educate yourself about the difference between the EEA and the EU but not about the political and economic instability relationship is beyond me. This is not up for debate and has been proven time and again.

&gt; The CBI ignores the difference here by suggesting only EU Political Union leads to Single Market access. Re-read their comments again and again.

Did you even read my last comment? You seem unable to comprehend different view points and instead of actually reading what ive written completely ignore it and labour the same points over and over. Ill quote what i wrote for you.

&gt; Yes it does and i agree it is misleading, but i also feel that it is hard to explain these complex trade agreements and different levels of EU to the layman. As well as this the anti-EU side is full of misinformation about the EU, how it works; and its effects on us.

&gt; Hence if single Market access is stipulated as Brexit then ""economic uncertainty"" is more than managed. 

Oh right, since when are you the negotiating party here? The conservatives want a re-negotiation on the EU, and will negotiate with the EU on the EEA, possibly wanting influence on its regulations.

UKIP on the other hand wants completely out of the EEA, and therefore wouldnt go the EEA/EFTA route.

Are you god or omnipotent? Because if so thats very impressive, otherwise stop pretending to know anything about how the negotiations will go, you dont know jack shit and neither do i.

Thats called uncertainty, and in this case its **Political and Economic uncertainty**.

&gt; Secondly a referendum is inevitable due to the ""democratic deficit"". 

What democratic deficit? I told you i could explain how the EU works to you if you didnt understand it, and you clearly dont as you speak of ""democratic deficit"". Here goes.

----

The three main institutions of the EU (troika) are:

**The European Parliament**

The European Parliament is a directly elected body. The European Parliament is accountable to European Citizens.

**The European Council**

The European Council is made up of the member nations head of states. Accountable to the member nations citizens.

**The European Commission**

The European Commission is formed by the Commission President who is chosen by the European Council and then elected by the European Parliament.

The European Council then appoints the other 27 members of the Commission in agreement with the elected President.

Then the European Commission as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament.

The European Commission is accountable to Parliament.

----

Which parts are un-democratic here? Elected representatives electing and approving a commission seems fairly democratic to me...

&gt; Again the referendum is a political event and Brexit is a political process. It is only a major economic event if we fail to stipulate Single Market access which via Artixle 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty and EEA treaty via EFTA membership achieves that condition.

Again you are wrong, perhaps when you are leader of a political party youll know everything. But the fact remains that UKIP and the conservatives both want to do different things and neither has finished drafting their ideas. So not even they know what they want yet.

 How you think you know what our political leaders want is beyond me and seems like pure lunacy.

&gt; Hence you logically derive the CBI is deceptive here.

Well no shit sherlock. Oh look a quote from my last comment ""yes i agree they are misleading"". Again, more evidence you didnt even read my comment. Disgusting.

&gt; The electorate have the right and expect the right of representation and hence pedagogy of their politicians. You seem to suggest ignorance is bliss?

""I dont understand the EU and how elected representatives work"". You need to go back to school.

&gt; Penultimately: Each time France, Netherlands and Ireland were given a Referendum on ""More EU"" ie EU Constitution they rejected it.

What do you know? More misinformation and pure garbage.

Sarkozy was elected President of the French Republic in May 2007. Amongst his pledges was a re-negotiation and ratification of a mini-treaty without a referendum. Eventually, the new version of the text, the Lisbon Treaty, was voted by the Parliament.

The first referendum by Ireland on the Treaty of Lisbon held on 12 June 2008 was rejected by the Irish electorate, by a margin of 53.4% to 46.6%, with a turnout of 53%.

The second referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon held on 2 October 2009 and the proposal was approved by 67.1% to 32.9%, with a turnout of 59%.

And the Netherlands's elected representatives ratified the Lisbon treaty in July 2008.

&gt; The British have not been given a choice

Blame Westminster for that, nobody else.

=&gt; Our league form doesn't really matter all that much. I'd rather Poch sees all the problems our squad has and rebuilds from the bottom in a season like this than graft our way through results and never realise the need for change.

Below the Champions League is the Europa League; something we can qualify for by doing well in the cup or by finish top 6 normally. We are still in with a good chance of renewing European football, something that shouldn't be disregarded as a way to attract players to the club. 

=&gt; Regardless of poor form, Europa League is absolutely still attainable. 

We're still in the League Cup, a good chance at silverware if we can somehow avoid/beat Chelsea. We've still got the FA Cup to come and most importantly, we're still in the Europa League. All our best performances have been in the EL so far this season, and if we can get a good run of form going there, I really believe we have a chance at winning it.

I was going shopping and I heard some commotion. I saw that there was a middle-aged Muslim man in a gown and hat, telling three young girls how to dress. They were wearing crop-tops and jeans, maybe one had a miniskirt. They looked about 15 years old but they could've been older. He was saying things like 'You'll never find a decent man dressed like that'. 
I couldn't believe what I was hearing, but I had to continue my shopping. I was really angry the whole time, though, and I kept thinking how it's 2014 and somebody's telling others what to wear. When I'd finished, I took the same route back to see if the guy was still there.

When I returned, the situation had escalated. There were now police talking to both the girls and the man separately. I talked to the girls and the police officer to tell them that I also saw him harassing them. While I was talking to them, the man pointed at me and shouted 'See! You should dress more like her!' (I was wearing jeans and a cardigan). I told them to ignore that, dress how they want, and that I wished I had confidence to wear clothes like theirs.

The police officer said I could make a statement if I wanted to, but I wasn't sure whether I wanted to do that. The man started going crazy and shouting 'Because of what THEY'VE said, you can arrest ME?' and they ended up putting him in the police car anyway. We parted ways and that was it.

It is untrue because many employers cannot fill NMW level jobs because the cost benefit ratio of working 40 hours a week in a job you don't like isn't sufficiently more rewarding than working 0 hours a week and getting only state benefits. It isn't possible to make the jobs more economically viable by raising minimum wage, particularly in areas like farming, as the jobs will either cease to exist or be off-shored. This strongly implies that the level of state benefit is too high.

&gt; The labor market is forced to work at the minimum wage in horrid conditions already. So how do you make work more worthwhile?

Reducing the benefits of the alternatives to NMW work is one option, but personally I'd prefer to see NMW abolished so that employers have to compete for labour rather than NMW acting as a wage ceiling for unskilled work as it does for the most part now. Obviously this would mean that there would be some jobs offering less than current NMW salaries, but these jobs would remain unfilled if the work wasn't sufficiently rewarding as we are currently seeing.",0,1415713231,null,0,false,0,clzctyo,t3_2ly9mb,t1_clzctyo,t1_clzcgli,null,1426080540,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2
