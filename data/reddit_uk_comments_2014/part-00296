false,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;I demonstrated the contradiction simply by posting the contradictory statements side by side. What followed after was an insult, but it wasn't central to my point.

You claimed something as true without explaining your reasoning and then insulted me. I took that insult to be acting as a validation of your point (given the lack of explanation) and thus an ad-hominem. Clearly I was giving you too much credit and you were just insulting me based on a totally faulty assumption. 

&gt;You are simultaneously contending that its up to people what they take from a book but that the core of the message is the nice parts on the basis that they take up more of the books. Actually I doubt that the nice bits do take up most of the books, and from what I've read irrationality, bigotry and violence occupy a large part of the Biblical narrative.

Honestly... having read back what I wrote I think you're probably right to call me out (see what happens when you discuss instead of insult) because I failed to articulate myself well. What I was trying to get across is that while we can make an appeal to the idea of an objective truth faith is a deeply subjective one. 

Case in point, the above, those are about the only 3 Bible passages that actually call for the death of non believers (I think anyway) and they are all old testament. If a Christian is going to argue that they are still vital and important to a Christian faith they've likely got a lot more contradictions to clear up explaining to do than a Christian who decides to say purely follow the idea of 'Love your neighbor as yourself"".

That is however an objective argument about what is a subjective article of faith and while it can act as one tool for framing a decision it can't be used to define a single ""truth"" one way or another. Religion *are* just that which people make of them because they are purely human constructions that exist to fulfil any number of roles for any number of reasons and they are, ultimately and inherently illogical.

false,dudewheresmykar,lfc99,,"Honestly, I would expect Rodgers to say this about any player in the press. 

To me, Balo was brought in to score goals - he isn't some new talent brought in for a big transfer fee; on the market he is, at least on paper, a tried and true striker with not only premier league experience but a title with Man City. While yes there are some qualms there and little stories and interpretations to his time at Man City, all in all Rodgers had expectations of the striker and with those expectations came a clean slate. This isn't about the Italian Balotelli, or the Man City Balotelli. For Rodgers this is about the LFC Balotelli.

Like I said, I would expect him to do this with any striker. If he had said this about Sturridge in the media, you can bet your ass it would fuel Sturridge into at least attempting to get a flurry of goals over the next couple weeks. This is professional football! Not a daycare where we baby some of the kids but are hard on the others. Rodgers has a way, and a system, and last year all we talked about was how great a manager he was, his innate talent in maximizing the resources at his disposal, and his ability to develop players.

What I am getting at is that I haven't changed my thinking since last season on this. I am glad he is treating Balotelli in a way not influenced by Balo's history. He isn't going to get special treatment here. Balo's manager said it himself that this is Balo's last chance at a marquee club. It isn't our job to cater to him, he needs to prove to us that he's worth buying at the end of this season. As a customer, Rodgers isn't happy and he has every right not to be right now, as do we.

Bullshit. There are behavioural tests that can be conducted, you can also monitor behaviour whilst in prison and continue with counselling etc. You can collect statistics on rates of re-offending and plan interventions and trial strategies with this goal in mind. 

For example, If, on the day of release after being convicted of a violent racist attack, a convict is heard spouting racist slurs, without stretching ourselves, we can imagine that they are likely to re-offend and, therefore, a danger to the public. Time served means very little; the public could be safe after one day or a hundred years.

Furthermore, like it or not, criminals are equal members of society; we have to protect their interests as well - locking them up with no chance of reform does not do this.

2. I would also say that you will need something over 75pts to qualify for Champions League, lastly

The good news is that our away form remains solid. Last season we got 10 away wins (1 so far this year) so if we achieve similar this year that would mean the home games against Man city/utd, Chelsea, Arsenal won't matter as long as we win the rest.

false,chrish1023,flair8,,"Talking about top 4 at this point in the season is always going to seem a bit ridiculous, but here is my take:

Chelsea - They will run away with the league
City - I think they will firmly win second. Once Toure starts playing well again, they will start whooping up on teams and comfortably take second.

This is where the shit show begins. There are legitimately 5 teams battling for the next two spots.

Arsenal - They were my pick to finish 3rd at the start of the season and I'm starting to rethink that. Ozil is just not nearly as good as he was for Madrid. He might turn it back on, but I'm not going to hold my breath. The rest of the team has some quality, but are they really any better than us? Ramsey will surely miss a third of the season, Sanchez is good yet inconsistent, and they're defense hasn't looked that tough.

United - They were my pick to finish fourth and at least at this point, they seem like top 4 quality. With that said, though, their defense is garbage and they have faced virtually no quality so far yet are level with us on points. I fully expect them to splurge in January if there is any top 4 doubt.

Liverpool - They are not the team they were last year; they had an entire team playing at the top of their abilities and now they lost their superstar. Yes they beat us, but they played a perfect game and our attacking style played right into their hands. I fully expect us to defend next time we play them, which will make for a much different game. As long as Hodgsen keeps playing Sturridge in Euro qualifiers, I think there is no way they take top 4. 

Everton - Like Liverpool, I think they drastically overachieved last season. They have had a very slow start to the season and I really don't seem them competing for top 4. They do not have the quality.

Us - We have not looked particularly good so far, but we have played a tough schedule; 5 of the 7 teams we've played will probably be top half. Our success will rely on whether we can get a striker to consistently score and whether Eriksen and Lamela can play to their best abilities. If those things happen, we will probably be top 4.

A system which says ""lock em up"" may sound like it protects us, but historical evidence of not working.
Likewise, the liberal attitude of forgiving offenders if they show signs of remorse... its just as emotional as throwing away the key in an act of revenge - it does nothing to help society.

I don't care if he's sorry, I care if he'll befriend someone else and then loose it because they do something he disagrees with. *I have no interest in him suffering or not suffering* - this is his own personal battle that, whilst related to the crime, has little to do with justice.

People want to pretend justice is either reactionary or bleeding heart. Both are bullshit responses to crime based on representing ones own personal values, not on solving issues.

Learn to lie. Seriously. I work with young people going through the same shitty process and they essentially do their thing and then lie their way through it.

This is the worst thing about the JSA/UC rules at the minute. Treating getting a job as a job is all well and good when there's an abundance of jobs out there to take up 6/7 hours a day, which there just isn't. But the JCP staff have their orders so....

So just lie, mate. 35 hours a week beyond your first week on JSA/UC is impossible unless you start applying for jobs posted months ago.

If, say, 99.99% of the wealth was concentrated among 0.01% of the population, would that be ok? Is there *any* number of 9’s which would cause you to think that the division has effects on society which are bad?

When there has been a dramatic shift in the division of wealth, are you saying this really has zero effect on society and therefore are unworthy of general engagement? 

I believe Wilkinson responded (based upon Saunders’ video) several times before giving up in seeming exasperation. It’s not the case, I believe, that he didn’t respond at all. As you yourself said earlier – it’s easier to attack a theory than to defend it and at some point authors can be excused for telling an attacker that it’s over. No hypothesis is so perfect it cannot be attacked repeatedly, especially in cases where the attacker refuses to accept the response. The attacks may be valid or not, but to the extent they consisted of points made in his video, there were hardly knockout blows.

People in a field may well quote supporting evidence from others in the field – Saunders certainly doesn’t hesitate to do so. But again, how many people believe it is not the issue – when I saw the video I was not concerned with the number of people who agreed (though I was glad to receive your link to someone who disagrees, thank you) but with the data itself.

Honestly, don't you think you're really just proving what someone said earlier: that people aren't interested in the data, just in holding to their ideological positions? You've made up your mind and no amount of data would change it (you'd just find ways to attack it, knowing that you can), nor would you even concede there's a grey area, something worth discussing. 

Whatever the dictionary versus colloquial definitions of “polemic” are, you used the word to denigrate Wilkinson’s work and I’m contending that there was no good reason to do so. You let Saunders off very lightly because you agree with him – and he may be right, but his arguments aren’t convincing or entirely honest and, from an academic, I would have expected something with far less obvious personal bias and far more substance.

TPWS loops technically don't ensure they're going slow enough — they ensure that any train on the line (hence they may assume braking performance of a heavy freight train) will stop within the maximum safe overrun distance (this is frequently beyond the signal displaying danger). The maximum safe overrun is essentially how far a train can overrun without causing any danger — if a signal is protecting a junction, the maximum safe overrun is running beyond the signal to the junction itself.

&gt; To the best of my knowledge, once the signaller has given permission to pass it should still be treated as ""danger"" (which is what a red means) and that there is something on the block ahead. Usually pass at danger will be so a train can come up behind another unit in the station, perhaps for coupling.

&gt;The __platypus__ (*Ornithorhynchus anatinus*) also known as the __duck-billed platypus__ is a [semiaquatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-aquatic_mammal) egg-laying [mammal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal) [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology\)) to [eastern Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_states_of_Australia), including [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania). Together with the four species of [echidna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna), it is one of the five [extant](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/extant) species of [monotremes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotreme), the only mammals that lay [eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology\)) instead of giving birth. It is the sole living representative of its [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology\)) ([Ornithorhynchidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithorhynchidae)) and [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) (*Ornithorhynchus*), though a number of [related species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_Monotremes) have been found in the fossil record.

&gt;The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, [duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck)-billed, [beaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver)-tailed, [otter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otter)-footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it, with some considering it an elaborate hoax. It is one of the few [venomous mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venomous_mammals), the male platypus having a [spur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spur_(zoology\)) on the hind foot that delivers a venom capable of causing severe pain to humans. The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology and a recognisable and iconic symbol of [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia); it has appeared as a mascot at national events and is featured on the [reverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse) of its [20-cent coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_twenty-cent_coin). The platypus is the animal emblem of the state of [New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales). 

&gt;Until the early 20th century, it was hunted for its fur, but it is now protected throughout its range. Although captive breeding programs have had only limited success and the platypus is vulnerable to the effects of pollution, it is not under any immediate threat.

false,savagewinds,null,null,"I know that we give Doctor Who a lot of wiggle room when it comes to science, but this episode basically strayed into a Sharknado-esque realm of stupid. 

When writing science fiction you can take liberty with unknown quantities; strange aliens can have fantastic technologies, things far in the future can be very different, etc.

But when you mess with known things, established laws of physics, familiar settings in close to modern day, you have to be careful to excuse your trespasses of established science. The writers didn't even attempt to cover their tracks here.

An increase of mass to the moon would be devastating to the Earth. The tides would be an issue, but the gravity would also affect the gaseous atmosphere, and drastically affect our orbit. And the changes in orbit would not be fixed by removing the mass. Not to mention Clara's statement that loosing the tides wouldn't be that bad. What? Tidal forces are incredibly important to the Earth's oceans, if they just stopped suddenly huge amounts of ocean life would be wiped out. It would affect the salinity of the ocean, which would affect ocean currents, which would affect temperature and wind patterns... Seriously, did Clara not take high school science?

Eggs don't gain mass as the incubate. It's an alien egg, so maybe it's different, ok. Where does that mass come from? Life gains mass by consuming resources. Since life is the entire moon in this case, what is it consuming in order to increase it's mass? Energy from the sun? Is it synthesizing the heavy elements needed? Because that can usually only be done in a supernova.

What the hell would killing the moon creature do? It's same mass would still be in orbit, as the article points out. It wouldn't change a goddamn thing on Earth.

Honestly, this is just too ridiculous. The writers just broke the law of gravity and the law of conservation of energy, and they don't even bother to give an explanation. Even a little bit of hand-waving would have been sufficient for me to go ""Well, at least they're addressing it, even if it is silly"", but there isn't even an attempt.

false,TheAnimus,null,null,"Because that isn't what freehold means.  In somewhere like London, where demand is highest, we are talking about 0.71% been 'long term empty'.  There is a good question as to how many of those would be truly habitable without work/investment.  Sometimes it can be a simple difference of opinion, children bickering over who gets the property as the will wasn't well written.  There can be issues when people want to do more long term planning permission required things.  Some even have other issues, almost two decades ago, a neighbour had a rather gruesome demise, the estranged daughter, didn't want to deal with it, so the property was left to rot until she felt able to handle the situation.  Can't say I blame her with the situation.

There are obviously a few trophy homes, I frequently cycle along an infamous road between Hampstead and East Finchley, infamous as being the most expensive in London and a pleasant cycle on the way to the park, many properties there are empty or being perpetually refurbished.

If it was due to your negligence, not following protocol etc, then he could terminate the contract under gross misconduct I believe.

The best thing to do is to get medical notes to verify what has happened, and see if you can get a medical professional to state he advices not to work for 2 or more weeks, and ask for help from HR.

Abrams that said once, ""If someone mentions something on a TV show, the character says it for a reason. It may be to eat up time, or it may be to further the plot, but it was written for them to say for a reason."", and this episode, if looked at that way, seems to have been 5 different episodes stuck in a food processor and then glued back together.

Like the whole gravity issue. They could have easily, 'hand-waved' the gravity away with The Doctor saying ""gravity boots"" or the TARDIS arriving on the station just as they astronauts were arriving and saying ""gav-plates in the floor, makes it feel like home..."" or something. But nope, egg. Egg? Egg.

What utterly made no sense was, the writers kept 'hand-waving' lines, to gloss over stuff - 'the spiders are single-cell germs', 'the spray kill 99.9% of germs', 'gravity - cause the thing in the egg is growing', etc. etc. to fix all the other errors. It was almost like they were writing the episode without a backspace. Like if had a typo where The Doctor called ""Clara"", ""Lara"" then we'd had a scene where The Doctor pops back in time and convinces Clara's parents to name her Lara - instead of just fixing the typo.

I get that the BBC is on a budget, but take some of that budget to do the Space Shuttle FX and hiring two other actors that serve no point and die off in minutes, and do low-gravity effects for 2 minutes, on the station, then have the gravity ""switch"" to Earth-like and then someone say, ""There, there gravity plates are on."", and everyone would be happy... Have the astronauts coming because the Mexican's stopped radio contact. Set it at 2074 instead of 2049, and have it where all mankind has done in nearly 100 years is just started mining the moon. Still would have the same, ""We should go back to space."" impact, and would have been a better story... But nope, egg. Egg? Gravity egg. Sure... 

Even more bizarre, Courtney makes specific mention that she has a biology textbook and the Doctor mentions his bookshelf. He even is dropping books on steps at the end of the episode. Almost taunting us, that there's books around that would utterly prove nothing in this episode made sense - within the very fiber of the episode we're watching. 

Like why would an egg suddenly weigh more? It would have to get mass from somewhere to weigh more, but the moon didn't suddenly eat six other moons. And if it was converting solar energy into mass then it should have been doing so for years... And how'd it suddenly lay a new egg, which appeared to be the same size of the old moon?!? It was like watching an old 2nd Doctor episode where they kept getting the terms 'solar system' and 'galaxy' confused to mean the same thing. And while in 1967 that was moderately okay for a children's series - I'm not so sure if it's okay after 40+ years of the Doctor railing about being the champion of science... I mean, the 4th Doctor talking about meeting Newton. The 5th using basic physics to get out of jams. The 7th hosting a [somewhat bizarre childrens science quiz show in 1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKj6jxwf7i0)...

I know, it's science fiction, and I know it's just a show, but in the end this just came off like it was late in the production season, and they just needed to get an episode out - so they just slapped some stuff together and rushed it out the door, ignoring even the rules the very episode setup for it to work by.

That does not appear to be the case because they didn't make a new ship in those 10 years but instead used one that was sitting in a museum. This implies that it wasn't a matter of rediscovering the technology to launch space flight but the fact that they had stopped putting people into space and didn't have any new space ships available. This of course ignores the fact that the Mexicans were on the moon and had to have gotten there somehow in the first place.

Then there's the fact that the power grid was clearly working just fine so it can't have been THAT devastating. Next there's the problem that the big supposed problem is that the tides have been super high and flooding cities but while that would be a big problem it wouldn't be a world ending event and wouldn't stunt civilization to that extent. Big tides is only a big problem if you're on the coast.

Also it was implied repeatedly that technology had advanced in those 10 years (For example when she implied that the text book would  have a search function) so clearly they still had lots of advanced technology so there's very little reason to use an old relic of a space ship when they could easily make a new one.

&gt;I saw it claimed somewhere that the idea that a molecularly engineered creature would be made of something like cells was wrong, because cells were an inefficient artifact of evolution, and it would be better to create it as a single structure.

Let's ignore their intelligent behavior (which would rule out a single celled organism because individual cells don't have a brain) and let's say that they were single celled. The fact that they could move means 1 of 2 things.

The short answer is yes, with some restrictions:

&gt;Headteachers and authorised staff can also search for any item banned by the school rules which has been identified in the rules as an item which may be searched for.

&gt;School staff can seize any prohibited item found as a result of a search.

&gt;You must be the same sex as the pupil being searched; and there must be a witness (also a staff member) and, if at all possible, they should be the same sex as the pupil being searched.

&gt;Teachers can only undertake a search without consent if they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a pupil may have in his or her possession a prohibited item. The teacher must decide in each particular case what constitutes reasonable grounds for suspicion. For example, they may have heard other pupils talking about the item or they might notice a pupil behaving in a way that causes them to be suspicious.

&gt;An item banned by the school rules may only be searched for under these powers if it has been identified in the school rules as an item that can be searched for.

&gt;The school rules must be determined and publicised by the headteacher in accordance with section 89 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 in maintained schools. In the case of academy schools and alternative provision academies, the school rules must be determined in accordance with the School Behaviour (Determination and Publicising of Measures in Academies) Regulations 2012.

Capaldis character overall is great, but its almost as if hes retained nothing from his previous incarnations. Suddenly hes a grumpy old codger who seems to have an irrational hatred for anyone who ever called themselves a soldier, which is quite contrary to his previous statements that everyone has good in them somewhere. 

I'd be fine with just that, but the way the episodes have been working out has just felt poorly executed on most accounts. I really enjoyed Robot of Sherwood (apparently thats the minority belief) but the arrow at the end of the episode felt wacky and out of place. Same with the newest episode, the ending was kinda forced, it felt like they took all the tension of the episode and threw it out the window, because at the end of the episode, regardless of what they did, the outcome would've been virtually the same. 

Finally I dislike how Moffat seems to be hijacking the entirety of the shows past, and twisting it around so that it fits into whatever plan he has coming. He could achieve the same result without making Clara apparently the most important person in his life (completely overruling the fact that Donna Noble was ""the most important women in all of creation"", and even that I found a little dumb).

So to end this mini-rant (i'm supposed to be taking a test right now), I dont think the current writing is *bad*, it could just be a lot better. I enjoy watching the show every week, and the plots themselves are usually pretty fun, but theres always just some little thing in every episode that makes me wish they had done it better.

What we have is The Doctor on a personal journey. His goal is simple and probably annoying to a lot of fans. Is he a good man? What does that mean? He faced a lot of demons on Trenzalore and they were all him. He's been running from himself for some time and has begun to doubt himself. He's aloof and at his chalkboard. He's analyzing every decision he's making and noting the outcome. He's doing so at a great risk to the universe around him.

&gt;[Doctor Who](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Borderlands_2_pop_culture_references)


    Hyperion robots can often be heard uttering ""Deleted!"" which is nearly identical to the attack phrase of the Cybermen, ""Delete!"".

    In the character selection screen, Claptrap sometimes says, ""I need to pee,"" which will trigger him to go into the outhouse. Said outhouse will then vanish, and pop back up, much in the same manner of the Doctor's TARDIS

    The character Maya was given to the Order of the Impending Storm, a play off of the nickname Oncoming Storm, given to The Doctor by the Daleks.

    Sometimes Krieg screams, ""You were fantastic, so was I,"" when winning a duel. This is a reference to the final words of the Ninth Doctor:  “Rose… before I go, I just wanna tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I!”

        When he goes down one of his phrases is, ""I don't want to go!""; the Tenth Doctor's last words.

        ""No last words for the eighth!"" refers to fact that the Eighth Doctor's regeneration was not shown before the game was released; his final moments have since been shown in the mini-episode, The Night of the Doctor.

        ""Feels different this time"" is a paraphrase of the Fifth Doctor's last words.

        ""It's the end... But the meat has been prepared!"" is a reference to the Fourth Doctor's last words (""It's the end... But the moment has been prepared!"") 

    When fighting Lab Rats, they'll sometimes scream, ""Don't blink! Blink and you're dead!""

&gt; What can be searched for ? 
 
&gt; * Knives or weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs and stolen items; and 
&gt; * Tobacco and cigarette papers, fireworks and pornographic images; and 
&gt; * Any article that the member of staff reasonably suspects has been, or is likely to be, used to commit an offence, or to cause personal injury to, or damage to property; and 
&gt; * Any item banned by the school rules which has been identified in the rules as an item which may be searched for. 

In particular the last point. So assuming my reading is correct, if the school has banned chocolate (presumably) and has listed it as banned and searchable for then they can randomly search for it without consent. A bit of a catchall if my understanding is correct (far from guaranteed)

_____

I started musing on the subject then thought it might be far easier to have a google. I turned up this: [""Searching, screening and confiscation: advice for schools.""](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/searching-screening-and-confiscation) (by the way, this was the google I made ""school's right to search pupils"" - What are you kids being taught these days?! ;) ). There are laws mentioned in the text, so I imagine it's all justifiable.

It would seem that, in regards to kids being suspected of selling stuff, then the school has the right to search with/without consent for (pages 6 &amp; 7):

* Any article that the member of staff reasonably suspects has been, or is likely to be, used to commit an offence, or to cause personal injury to, or damage to property; and      
* Any item banned by the school rules which has been identified in the rules as an item which may be searched for

In the first instance I suppose it would only be applicable if the re-selling of goods on school property if illegal? I'm not sure that it really is... technically maybe, but I don't think that'd hold water. More likely they're going down the other route: In the second I would image the school has put in a ""ban on goods that are to be sold"" and has made it clear to everyone. So I'd guess they have a rule: ""If you've got a mars bar, fair enough; If you have 20 then you're selling them on and that shit won't fly.""

Also it outlines that the law says a teacher can search if:

&gt; If you have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a pupil is in possession of a prohibited item.

There's a requirement that the searcher must be the same sex as the pupil being searched, but I'd guess that's more for a 'personal' search. If you wanted to cause waves then you might refuse to let a female teacher go through your bag (if you're a bloke). I doubt it'd enamour you to the staff in general.

Points on page 8 state again that the school must have identified that certain items are prohibited and have communicated it. So it could be that they're covered on that front if they've sent a letter out to parents etc. saying ""None of this selling m'larky. Anyone found with lots of stuff will get a slap.""

To summarise: 

It would seem from this that the school has a right to search if they've made it clear that they don't want pupils selling stuff on. However I think they might be pushing it by demanding to search everyone, if that's what they've been doing: they should have suspicion that someone has stuff on them, rather than doing random searches. 

Depending on how assertive I was feeling, I might have refused to be searched when I was at school because I was a goody-two-shoes and wouldn't have been doing something like that. Then again *because* I was a goody-two-shoes I doubt I'd have had the balls to say no!

Some of the answers to those questions she refused to answer would have been well known to the police already, but they're trying to make sure her/their story is straight. I would imagine that, under legal advice, they refused to answer the questions to ensure they don't (accidentally) incriminate themselves.

Taking the devil's advocate view: If you answer a question 'wrongly' e.g. you mis-remember or speak incorrectly under stress, it might cause the police to focus on that. They might jump on it as an instance that 'proves' you've been lying and so they'll forget everything else and try and pin the disappearance on you.

If you know you're innocent, but you also know that the police suspect you and you're not so naive as to think ""If I tell the truth then all will be OK"", then not speaking may be the best option. Imagine being mistaken about something and having the police think you're guilty after that. Meanwhile you know you're innocent and the person who took your daughter is still out there with her.

I don't think you've been watching football for very long. Fabregas left Arsenal because Barcelona was his childhood club. It had nothing to do with money.

His first choice was to move back to Arsenal. Like Lampard with Chelsea, Arsenal didn't want him, so he moved to a team that could match his ambitions.

Lampard too is playing for our direct title rival and scoring important goals for them. It is the same situation.

Gotze leaving Dortmund is the worst comparison you could have made to Fabregas. Gotze grew up in Dortmund and left for a club he has no connection to even though he had the option to stay at Dortmund.

I see that there's a new scheme which gives property owners incentives to refurb and fill their long-term empty houses, so I guess some of what I'd envisaged is actually happening.

I'd like to see a cessation of all new builds, and a focus on making derelict, empty, unfit properties livable. The site says they don't count properties which are unfit for habitation, scheduled for demolition, or which are located over shops.

I'd say those are the ones we *need* to be counting and focussing on, as their estimates are that there are around half a million properties in those categories. Getting people into those houses - pushing through with demolition and erecting new housing on the empty sites, repairing the uninhabitable places, aggressively incentivising businesses to rent out their empty properties at reduced cost...it's not going to solve the problem, but it's better than the nothing that's being done now.",0,1412620835,null,0,false,0,cl232jw,t3_2ifzwv,t1_cl232jw,t1_cl21i8j,null,1426655989,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Reading and learning about it all is a great start. Generally understanding the markets, what they are and they changes you can see will help you not freak out when things drop in value or chase the latest ""high performing"" fund.

In general, http://www.bogleheads.org/ is a great place to look around, although you'll find that a lot of the advice is based around the US things are quite transferrable (specific types of retirement account/etc aren't really relevant). /r/personalfinance is also full of very helpful people on these topics.

&gt; Do you have any tips/tricks for investing in stocks and shares?

* Beware of large charges (one percent is a lot of growth to lose)
* Watch out for different buy/sell values (if there's a 10% difference, you've got to see a 10% gain to break even)
* Don't sell because things are performing badly in the short term (this is called ""buying high and selling low"")
* Your portfolio should be boring, buy, hold and don't watch the figures too much (although it is really tempting, I still check it way too much)

Alright, I'm in Clara's shoes. Firstly, it's not genocide. Genocide is that act of killing a large number of people of a set race/group/kind. I'm making a creature extinct by killing the only one of it's kind. Risking the destruction of billion's of sentient creatures in order to save the life of one creature is moronic. The choice Earth's population made is still an easy choice. Does that mean I will take pleasure in killing the creature? No. The choice is still easy. If I was in Clara's shoes I would let the creature die, unless the doctor had advice to the contrary. The choice would not be difficult for me.

&gt; And in regards to Clara's ""unjustified"" fury at the Doctor, he left her with the above choice. Regardless of the outcome, she has every right to be angry.

Clara has been happy to have the doctor make life or death decisions in the past. It is unjust for her to expect him to always makes humanities decisions and not shoulder some of them herself. The Doctor treated her like an adult and she complained.

I stand by my earlier point. Clara choose to gamble humanities future rather than take a life. The gamble came good so she effectively lost nothing. If the Doctor had left her to kill the moon, it would have made her rage more understandable as she had no need to get blood on her hands at all.

&gt; Get your head out your ass and stop trying to be edgy.

There are far more than 300k dwellings on the site, as they state quite clearly. there are a good half million they can't count, as statistics are unreliable:

&gt; Homes in very poor condition can be excluded from council tax and so are not counted in these statistics. No data is available to quantify how many of these there are nationally. Recent research in Bradford showed that there were 5,000 uninhabitable homes in that city, this indicates that there are many thousands across the country.

&gt; Currently 40,000 homes that were due for demolition under now cancelled regeneration schemes stand empty.

&gt; Flats above shops... A report carried out for the government in 2004 estimated that there were 300,000 flats in this state in England.

The site seems concerned only with immediate occupation homes, where someone, at some point needs to look ahead a little bit.

I don't think London needs to be the only answer for people looking to move out of their home city or country. if it's so over-capacity, then yes, by all means, obviously, **let's** stop people moving and settling there. Shunt the extreme amounts of money spent on the Capitol into more rural areas, doing just what you mentioned - improving civic and public amenities and services **outside** London and...well, let's call it ""relieve the pressure on our beleaguered capital city"". I would personally call it ""fair redistribution of wealth"", but I'm not and never will be a Londoner, so I'm naturally biased.

I don't necessarily think we need to call them migration controls. If a house is overcrowded, then the humane thing to do is move some people out of it. The same for a city. If there's too many people there for the housing stock to sustain them, relieve the crowding by stopping anyone else moving in, and by moving out the people who can't afford to live there, or haven't got the space they need.

You can't blame the EU for our obsession with living in London. Nobody from Strasbourg or Brussels demanded that everyone should worship London, or that anyone coming from outside should consider everywhere else in the country to be uninhabitable.

growth shouldincrease, but London cant sustain any more growth, where places like the North East, Wales and the midlands are begging for growth and investment, so let London stick at the level it's at and give the rest of the country the boost it needs - including redeveloping brown belt and derelict sites, renovating uninhabitable housing, demolishing and rebuilding and forcing reluctant landlords and owners back into the market.

I've heard that the bbc insists that every episode have a monster, which sucks because some of the best Hartnell serials and Big Finish audios have no monsters.

&gt;But this is all window dressing. The real problem for me, is that this is the first episode where I've gone from liking Capaldi's doctor to not liking him. Instead of being someone who doesn't get other people and is abrasive because of a certain amount of social cluelessness, he's now callously abrasive and even psychologically abusive. I know the Doctors have been somewhat this way from time to time on a bad day, but this so far defines this Doctor. Up until last week, I had found his behavior oddly endearing.

I've been enjoying his callousness, but felt like he would eventually dial it down. I think there is a chance Kill the Moon could have been his wake up call that he needs to be less of a dick. Like what they tried to do with Six, but with a notable turning point.

&gt;If the season were to end now, Capaldi's Doctor would be my least favorite of all fourteen. That's right, I disliked this episode so much that I'm allowing Peter Cushing out of the box and temporarily including him in cannon just so I can put Capaldi lower.

His best moments for us have come when he was pushed further up and I think that may continue. I think Henderson needs to improve his vision if we want him to dictate the game from further back. 

Further Gerrard also helps us play out of pressure with his confidence on the ball and passing ability. He is someone who can receive the ball under pressure and make sure it gets to someone in space or someone who can pass to someone in space. I'm not as confident with Hendo in such a position as I am with Gerrard. 

That defensive set up you described would require us to sit relatively deep. It would also curtail Hendo getting forward. That being said we could try a high line with Gerrard as CAM, but then we would suffer in our pressing.

If you take the term masterclass in that sense then Silva's performance was just that.  He stayed mobile, protected and recycled the ball well under high pressure, applied pressure when out of possession, attempted to draw defenders out by drifting between lines, knew where his runners were, and demonstrated a range of technique to provide appropriate service.

The investment could see the club become global, at the end of the day, football has evolved and money is a quite big part. It isn't a coincidence that the biggest clubs in Europe are also some of the richest. The investment can keep certain players at the club, allow other players to leave and bring other into it. We could also see the development of the youth system. More money can be put in to bringing in better staff. The bigger investment would also help with paying off the stadium. We could also see as I said, better staff but also attract world class managers. Overall, investment can propel the team greatly.

The negatives however are still there. There is a chance the heritage of the club could get ignored. West Ham is one of the oldest clubs in London. The club has a massive history in London so it cannot get forgotten with a new investment. The club badge should not be fundamentally changed too much either. It needs to be remembered that West Ham is historically a working man's club. Low ticket prices (in particular Kids for a Quid) is a massive part of West Ham. As such, ticket prices should remain the same, or lower, as the expansion should allow for prices to slightly drop. Basically, the club should not be meddled with. We can't have a Cardiff or Hull City situation, where the club has been completely re-branded, its colours changed, all to sell to an overseas market, where it will ultimately, not actually even sell that well. 

As its already been stated, we also can't begrudge the two Daves. They have certainly saved and helped push the club forward in great directions. Exciting times are ahead indeed lads!",0,1412630163,null,0,false,0,cl281qc,t3_2ignzn,t1_cl281qc,t3_2ignzn,null,1426653596,1,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,1

In most cases you would have a short assured tenancy which generally means unless your lease has reached its end point then you cant be evicted before that date - so for example if you have a year long lease from January 2014 to January 2015 then you can only be evicted under whats called section 33 proceedings in January 2015 at the earliest.

The exception would be if your lease contained a break clause permitting early eviction if sufficient notice is given. That has to apply to both parties though - if the lease says that your landlord can evict you simply by giving three months notice then this may fall short of the legal requirements to actually be enforceable. If it also says that you can leave after giving three months notice then it may be valid though - basically break clauses need to be fair to both parties. Other exceptions include the usual things such as breach of contract etc.

Universities nowadays expect a LOT of you (maybe they always did, I don't know) - but today you don't get free money just for going to them, and moreover, the loans that you do get don't go as far because everything is more expensive across the board.

Something needs to change, because so many universities are still in the mindset of expecting you to literally spend all your time doing your course. Of course some people have to take up jobs while doing uni and can't focus all their time on it, but the universities often have no way of dealing with or processing this and just put all the blame on the student. That in itself can be very stressful.

And yes, it is hard suddenly moving from being a big fish in a small pond to one of many medium sized fish in a lake. Maybe not everyone can understand or sympathise with that in an academic context, but if you apply it to other contexts, its probably a lot more common than you would think. I'm not sure if I agree that the environment drives people to eating disorders - I think that's probably more a combination of other factors. 

The whole Cambridge/'good universities' mindset is a problem in itself I think honestly. That in order to get anywhere everything has to be focusing on being the best. In my heart of hearts I'm not sure if Cambridge/Oxbridge as it is nowadays even is a good place for poorer students to go to; because of all the stresses associated with seeing these rich people day in day out when you yourself don't have much.

  Even if the actual number of actual, practicing Christians is small, there still exists the small issue of David Cameron stating 'this is a Christian country' and the fact that the Church of England has as its head the Queen, also head of state. Then there's the bishops in the House of Lords, the Christian schools receiving state funding, the Church of England itself receiving hefty whacks of public money and so on. No other religion has such a thing, even if individuals in the Lords/Commons may be of that particular faith or whatever. 

  And whilst the habit of some Christians is to change their religion to suit their own needs (which is precisely what Islam teaches!) the fact of the matter remains that Christianity the religion and the New Testament scripture teach that Jesus was the Son of God, he was crucified, rose after three days and ascended to heaven.

But I disagree.  Morality is not a cultural artifact which means different things depending on where you live.  Rather, it is a product of *reason*, just like quadratic equations and the iPad.   And this explains how we've been able to make enormous moral progress over the centuries.  Why we now have more and more rights and freedoms.  Why violence has been rapidly declining.  It's all because we've been able to apply reason to continually improve our morality, in much the same way that reason has allowed us to make scientific and technical progress.

Here's a short video which explains some of these concepts better than I could:  [""The long reach of reason"" by Steven Pinker (psychologist at Harvard) and Rebecca Goldstein (philosopher + novelist)](https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_and_rebecca_newberger_goldstein_the_long_reach_of_reason)

I think the issue I have with the episode is that -- this is not just a minor problem, the entirety of the idea of the episode is so far beyond the realm of reasonability, and really it's entirely unnecessary. Why not have the problem be that the seismic activity of the moon is hurtling large (but not apocalyptically large) meteors at Earth for unknown (later to be discovered that it's part of the hatching process) reason? That's significantly more plausible than gravity shifts and so on.

Part of it is that I have an intuition for this sort of thinking, partly due to training and education (I did study math, after all), but also somewhat naturally (or else I probably wouldn't be interested in math). The problem is that it smacks of lazy writing. Someone thought ""Wouldn't it be neat if the moon was actually an egg"", and then worked backwards to make that conceit 'work'. Now, I'm willing to suspend disbelief and take a little technobabble (I mean, I do watch the show, the dude is a two-hearted alien time traveler that regenerates -- where does his other heart fit? The inside of a humanoid form doesn't really have a lot of room for more stuff. Time Travel is probably not possible in the way he does it, and regeneration -- wtf), indeed, you can't watch sci-fi without accepting a few absurd things, I think my issue is that this was something that was so easy to get right, but instead they took a lazy path and focused on dancing around going ""Look it's an egg and a cheap metaphor about abortion!""

The issue's not necessarily just university pressure- that's something that can be managed. It's that it's an extremely unhealthy environment for people who've developed latent issues. 

Given how widespread mental health issues seem to be at universities, I'm surprised that it's not commonplace for universities to offer more than a token measure of preemptive help- or, if not that, proactive engagement with students that seem to be struggling, and actually taking an interest in the people they're teaching beyond their being a name on a page and a candidate number. 

They're academic institutions of course, not therapists- and what support is there at most places can be reasonable, if the right boxes are ticked for it to get kicked into action. But, on the other hand, it's still an absolute travesty that so many people are limited from reaching their potential thanks to issues that can be treated. The NHS' coverage of mental health issues is so bad as to warrant being called a national point of shame, if anything- the only organisations around that *can* pick up the slack are the universities and unions themselves.

...I suppose the blame falls squarely with the NHS' mental health services, really.

To be fair, last season was great because he'd do something amazing once every three matches or so, but last season was more of an exception than the rule.

On a bad day David Silva usually puts in the same amount of work as on a good day, the difference is often to do with what his team-mates or opponents are doing around him.

With Toure the difference between a good day and a bad day is mostly down to him.  If he's having a bad day it's usually because he's showing no interest in having a good day.

&gt;

&gt;__Irish Argentines__ are [Argentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_people) citizens of Irish ancestry. Irish [emigrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration) from the Midlands, Wexford and many counties of Ireland arrived in [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina) mainly from 1830 to 1930, with the largest wave taking place in 1850–1870. The modern Irish-Argentine community is composed of some of their descendants, and the total number is estimated at 500,000–1,000,000. Argentina is the home of the fifth largest Irish community in the world.

I don't know what you like to eat but we favour a nice wide selection. We buy beansprouts for £1/kg at Seoul Plaza (I think its called) along with Chinese leaf (~£1.40). Noodles are sourced from B&amp;M for £2 - 3 per kilo (individual packets) and coconut milk at two tins for £1. Wraps are bought in ASDA for £1 per packet of 8. Beef mince is again ASDA at £4 per kilo (we generally buy two 750g packs and split them into 5 bags of 300g and then freeze them).

&gt;Date of first registration 04 January 2002

&gt;Year of manufacture 2002

&gt;Cylinder capacity (cc) 124cc

And a quick check of the cg125 wikipedia page shows these indicators of model year:

&gt;Over its lifetime, the CG125 has received numerous enhancements and tweaks:

&gt;The electrics were upgraded from 6 V to 12 V (1985 in UK)

&gt;The old contact breakers were replaced by electronic ignition (1995 in UK).

&gt;An electric start was added in 2001, originally alongside the original kick start and replacing it completely in 2004 (in the European Market).

&gt;2004 saw a number of further changes in the European market:

&gt;The front drum brake was replaced by a disc brake

&gt;A new instrument cluster, including a fuel gauge for the first time, replaced the old square unit.

&gt;The chain casing was dropped in favour of a simpler chain guard

Looking at the eBay listing we can see in the pictures and from the description that it has an electric starter, but still has drum brakes and the square instrument pod. That places its date of manufacture sometime between 2001 and 2004, which matches up with the date of registration and listed manufacture date. Note the above is based on cursory research and others might be able to help in more detail.
 
As far as repairing the cosmetic damage, the question is how worth it is it to repair? Stripping and repainting wouldn't be too hard, but it has clearly suffered some relatively serious knocks (looking at the cable ties holding the front mudguard together). Are you buying this as something to fix up, or as a first bike to learn on?

Regeneration is very similar to this in my mind, but as if the process went slightly wrong, and the 'new' version was slightly muddled and not quite an exact copy.

A newly regenerated Doctor may have all the memories of the previous incarnations, but the previous Doctors are gone. It is, quite literally, a death for each incarnation, although they live on in the memory of the Doctor.

While I agree that their behaviour was poor, probably immoral and unethical, it is not really fair, or again particularly moral or ethical, to report that they caused her to kill herself (whether they are explicitly stating this or not.)

One of the Samaritan's guidelines for reporting on suicides is as follows:
&gt; Approximately 90 per cent of people who die by suicide have a diagnosed or undiagnosed mental health problem at the time of death.

&gt;Over-simplification of the causes or perceived ‘triggers’ for a suicide can be misleading and is unlikely to reflect accurately the complexity of suicide. For example, avoid the suggestion that a single incident, such as loss of a job, relationship breakdown or bereavement, was the cause.

The problem I'm having is: why now? Clegg is still very much a part of the coalition government - one that has been basically static for like a year now. He and the Lib Dems have had ample time to drum up at least some kind of support with what are *actually liberal policies*.

Yeah, talk is cheap, and something needs to be done; but we also can't forget that Clegg is in a position where the only thing he *can* do is 'talk'.

I mean mass doesn't just come and go, and it certainly doesn't disappear in such a way as to make the gravity in a single room drastically different from that in the other rooms, like when Courtney floated. Also, just because something is a prokaryote doesn't mean that disinfectant is going kill it. Oh, and if the moon really did gain that much mass it would have probably thrown earth out of its orbit killing everybody, not just make the tides higher. And how on earth did the baby dragon thing lay an egg that was the same size as it? And did previous astronauts/rovers not notice that there was no solid, inorganic material (i.e. minerals) on the moon? Oh yeah, and I guess the people on the day side of the earth don't get a vote. And how did the thing fly away? You don't just flap your wings in space and expect to get to escape velocity. 

Sorry for my rambling and ranting. Even though Kill the Moon was good for many reasons, it was quite ridiculous at times. Normally I ignore all the bad science in Doctor Who, because to me it is more a fantasy show than a science fiction one. That's why I can live with and enjoy an episode in which the Doctor shoots a gold arrow into the side of a ship to make it go. I never bat an eye when the Doctor talks about weird timey-wimey stuff.

Well it's going to need to poach workers from other businesses but to do that it's going to need to incentivise workers away from its competitors which in practice means offering higher wages and other benefits at a sufficiently higher rate to cause people to want to jump ship. And every business is going to be in the exact same position.  
  
In theory, this could lead very rapidly to hyper-inflation as wages skyrocket at a rapid rate. In practice that probably isn't going to happen as the escalating costs are going to place a substantial check on the ability of businesses to be able to afford to grow.

http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/commentaryfinal[0].pdf

**It's quoted as £2.50 for every £1 spent on treatment** (page three). 

[imgur link to screen shot](http://i.imgur.com/fO6mTkA.png)

This is Estimate saving to the NHS,victims of crime, police and court from having addicts in treatment. £960,000,000 is crime prevented by having 197,111 addicts in treatment ( same source page 2) - that's £4,870 per addict in treatment.

However

http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/whyinvest2final.pdf

Here it says the total cost of crime is £13,900,000,000 committed by 306,000 heroin and crack users.  That's £45,424 per addict nearly 10 times to other figure. This seems very high.

Late on it say's that every addict not in treatment commits £26,074 of crime.

So there you have it drug related crime cost £4,870 or £26,074 or £45,424 depending on which NHS crime figure you take. 

I think the £45,424 figure is too high as I think that is the  total cost of drug crime and NOT just the total cost addicts. 

I also think the £26,074 is too high as it's formed ( as far as I can tell ) from taking the total cost of addiction per month and adding it up for a year (£1,400 per month = £16,800 per year) and then adding police and court costs. However I don't think many addicts are really stealing £16,800 per year without getting caught. That really is a very skilled thief in the cctv age. You also have to take into account that addicts pay with savings, selling possessions , some never steal, some steal only from family and friends and some drift in an out of problem drug use. Many of them get caught at some point in their decline and forced to confront their addiction. Female addicts often resort to prostitution - which is technically not criminal.

as for the cost of treatment

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8584488/Benefits-and-treatment-for-drug-addicts-cost-3.6-billion-a-year.html
&gt;Jun 2011

&gt;The annual cost of maintaining treatment and paying benefits to the 320,000 problem drug users is £3.6 billion, the report estimated.

&gt;This includes £1.7 billion in benefits, £1.2 billion for looking after the children of drug addicts and £730 million for prescribing methadone

If you assume that the £730 million spent on methadone is for 197,000 addicts actually in treatment ( the years are about the same and not all problem users are in treatment ) that works out as £3705 per addict - quite reasonable I think.

http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/about/difference/RIOTT.aspx

This cost of treating addicts with heroin is 

&gt;Supervised heroin treatment costs around £15,000 per patient per year, while the typical cost of prison is £44,000 per year per person, he says (1).

As far as the abortion metaphor. I think most stories admit a few interpretations, there's no one-true-meaning to anything, really. Not killing something because we don't understand it is an equally good interpretation of the story. But I felt that the metaphor of abortion and the right to chose was made more clear. Looking at it, you have three women at various stages of life all presented with the option to terminate an as-yet-unborn living thing. The reason for doing so is to save the life of the 'mother' (Earth), but at the last minute Clara has a crisis of conscience and apparently turns pro-life or something. Your interpretation also suffers from similar issues (apparently Clara is the only person who 'got' that maybe not understanding something isn't cause for killing it), but ultimately I think everyone will see something a little different with any story.

I still didn't care for the story -- not just on scientific or interpretive fronts. I thought it was just a little bit dull, to be honest.

A punch as a pass is something that is not only a difficult skill, but made much harder by the crowd of people one has to navigate (the occasions you will most likely punch). I think you'll find that, if a keeper's aim is to start a swift counter attack, it is often more productive to catch and release quickly. This is A) because of the increased range a keeper has once he has the ball in his hands and B) the added accuracy of a throw/drop kick will actually give the attack as a whole more speed, despite the punch being quicker. 

Punches are still used traditionally except for rare circumstances. Most keepers resort to punches in a situation where catching is either impossible or overly risky. A punch is still a risk in and of itself, as even 'good distance' on a punch can land at the wrong players feet.

Now you have a flat you are always invited to the party. Because the party is at your house. 

Operate BYOB and let people know about the 3 day rule. If you bring beer and expect it to be here next weekend, dream on. I will leave it for 3 days in case of return and then it will be had. This allows people to bring their beer on a Friday and know it's still about on Sunday or Monday for a bank holiday sesh. 

Don't smoke in your house. Stinks the place up. It's tempting, but just take it outside. You will smoke less (if you do smoke) and your house will smell nicer. On this note buy some plug in air fresheners and put one in the entrance area and one in the living space. 

I don't know how well your parents house trained you but learning to cook things like lasagna, bolognese, chilli con carne and a basic curry makes everyone think you are some gourmet god but they are a piece of piss and if you have mates coming round they are as easy to make for 20 as for 2. 

Buy milk in pints. Buying the 6 litre value milk might seem like a good idea but no human can ingest that much dairy before it goes off. And when it does go off. Oh my god that's bad news. 

Clean up as you go. I learned this the hard way when I discovered mould underneath my kettle. It takes 5 minutes to wash up. Just do it now otherwise you will spend a day trying to clean when you realise your parents are coming round and you don't have a clean mug.

Buy clothes that don't run or - only wear dark clothes. Separating that shit is a pain and often you won't have enough of one to create two separate wash loads. Electricity and water are expensive don't waste them. 

It's just about to be winter so here is my number 1 tip. Keeping a blanket and a hoody by your sofa will save you more on your gas bill than you would ever believe. My first flat didn't have double glazing or central heating. It was colder inside than out.

Learn to play an instrument. You're about to have some time to yourself. You will wank more than you ever have, sometimes in the middle of the day after watching Jeremy Kyle the mood will take you so right there in the front room you'll just go for it. But to prevent your member taking too much of a beating. Find other single player activities to keep you amused before the guys head round for beer. Guitar is brilliant for that, reading books is also good. I'm freelance so have more time at home alone than most but Saturday afternoons get boring too. 

A few sleeping bags are a must. I had a spare room with 3 beds in it and a cupboard with three camp beds. 6 sleeping bags and you can prevent your mates driving home drunk. Or worse still - staying sober. 

This is going to lead to situations where bacon is necessary. Have some in the freezer at all times safe in the knowledge that you won't have to cook it. ""Fuck you make your own bacon sandwich, and make me one while you are at it"" get another of your mates to wash up and you can leisurely scratch your balls in front of the TV. 


Don't pay for a TV license. TV is shite and there are adverts, netflix and iplayer is all the TV you will ever need. Use an Xbox or similar so you can watch these on the TV.

Design your bedroom the way you imagine a woman would. Again I learnt this the hard way, for the first few months I was happy with my floordrobe, mattress on the floor and vague man aroma. Get a nice double bed, fit a dimmer switch, have straighteners, make up remover, spare towels, hair dryers. Women are more likely to stay over if they can make themselves look nice again the next day - FACT!

This episode had an imaginative plot I could even say that it was cute (anything involving a baby animal is cute). However, I feel as though a whole lot of moon-related Doctor Who episodes (however many there are) were just retconned by having the moon be a giant egg. What's more, does this mean that the satellites that orbit the other planets are eggs as well?

Also, when the egg finally hatched, we get to see this awesome dragon thing. However, we only see it for a second before it pans away and it disappears. I don't have a difficult time believing that the creature was born pregnant since there are animals in real life that reproduce that way (aphids, anyone?) but how can a serpentine creature like that lay something of that size and rotundity?

It wasn't all bad, though. I liked the Doctor's speech at the end, saying that this event triggered a space-age renaissance because it caused us to look up at the sky instead of down at our screens.

Someone like Orson (who clearly __wants__ to be known as brave) would of course give away a treasured heirloom to someone as noble and selfless as that - especially if he knew his granddad always harboured a soft spot for her (even if he did go on to have a happy life with someone else).

I kinda hope they end up together too (at least for a while), but at the same time...not only do I want a moving 'death' ending for Clara but...we've already seen a happy marriage with Amy/Rory. Even after they were stuck back in time, via that P.S. minisode (though it was bittersweet) we learnt it __was__ still effectively a happy ending for them *as a pair*. The reason I don't want Clara/Danny to end up together is to see a new story, rather than a re-hash.

I don't think ""They DON'T get stuck back in time"" would create enough of a difference between Danny/Clara and Amy/Rory, personally.

People were saying it's not that he isn't rated, but *just* imagine if he were white and English how highly he would be rated. He has been going missing this year because he has been out of form for pretty much the first time since he joined, but last year only Suarez stopped him being everyones player of the year, and in my opinion in the end they were actually about tied as Suarez tailed off just a little bit towards the end of the season, whilst Toure finished strong to help City to the title. If he ever went missing in previous seasons maybe that's because at CDM you should naturally have periods of minor input during a game.

I agree that Wenger should have been punished. I never said otherwise. But It's crazy to assume he would have received the same punishment as if Jose did. I think he should have been yellow carded at least by the official too. That would force the FA to take it seriously.

The FA are supposed to be impartial, but they are so biased against Chelsea and Mourinho. 

Mourinho's sarcasm was hitting at the legitimacy of the refs and FA. That wouldn't be as much of a problem if Jose wasn't consistently hinting at it for the weeks building up to the final comment. They finally had something on him, and convicted him for it.

false,TaxTalkinGuy,null,null,"Hello, I'm a U.S. tax attorney and tax return preparer who specializes in Americans living and/or investing abroad.

U.S. citizens who live outside the U.S must file U.S. tax returns each year (assuming they make over $10,000 or earn $400 from self-employment).  They must also file a separate form called the Foreign Bank Account Report if they have over $10,000 in non-U.S. bank accounts.

However, the rules generally operate so that you won't pay tax twice (i.e., to both the U.S. and the UK).  Instead, your earned income under $100,000 will not be subject to U.S. tax at all, and you will get a dollar-for-dollar credit against your U.S. tax for any UK tax you pay on other income.  Since UK tax is most often higher than US tax, it is very likely that you will never have to actually pay any U.S. tax.

One really annoying thing is that the U.S. tax reporting rules can be a real pain in the ass in certain circumstances.  So, if you have a tax-advantaged retirement or savings account, or you form a trust, or you invest in non-U.S. mutual funds, or you own more than 10% of a non-U.S. corporation, then you must file all sorts of complicated forms, and there's generally a hefty penalty for the failure to file.

Right now you can easily do your U.S. tax return yourself by going to www.taxact.com.  However, once you start making more and getting into investing and other complicated stuff, it would be worth it to talk with a U.S tax adviser to make sure you are keeping up with the required paperwork.",0,1412649527,null,0,false,0,cl2hmfm,t3_2idjpd,t1_cl2hmfm,t3_2idjpd,null,1426649100,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

It reaches a bigger worldwide audience than any other news organisation, including 150 million daily listeners of the World Service, which in many cases is the only reliable news available to them. Currently it is instrumental in the dissemination of localised news and medical advice in Western Africa relating to the Ebola outbreak.

I think Season 5 is one of the best runs of Doctor Who. Unfortunately a good deal of it is missing so I would suggest that if you are uncomfortable with the audios just stick with Tomb of the Cybermen, The Ice Warriors, Enemy of the Word and The Web of Fear (meet the Brigadier) which are all complete to mostly complete. Season 7 is also a really strong one in my opinion as well.

The Dalek Invasion of Earth is definitely a must, although it just might break your heart though at the end. The Invasion is probably up there with my favorite invasion of Earth stories and Cybermen stories and hey who doesn't want to see more of the Brigadier.

The War Games is probably one of the best and most ambitious regeneration stories. There is some padding here or there (it is four hours long) but it pretty much grabs one's attention throughout. Caves of Androzani is another really good regeneration story. It is largely considered one of the best stories in comparison to both New Who and Classic Who and one of my personal favorites.

For the more experimental episodes try Edge of Destruction (takes place entirely in the TARDIS), The Celestial Toymaker (celestial being toys with reality), and The Mind Robber (takes place in the Land of Fiction), The Deadly Assassin (companionless)

Definitely check out Terror of the Autons so you can meet the Classic Master for the first time and Genesis of the Daleks to meet Classic Davros for the first time. For the Fourth Doctor also check out Ark in Space, Pyramids of Mars, The Talons of Weng Chiang, and The Invasion of Time.

The Key to Time Arc (Season 16) is also another must see. You get to meet the Guardians, a female Time Lord and an old school pal from the Doctor's academy days.

For shock factor check out Earthshock and Warriors of the Deep both of which occurred in Five's run. If you would like to see the Brigadier again also check out the Mawdryn Undead.

Season 23 may not be the best season of Doctor Who ever but I always suggest that everyone try Trial of a Time Lord once.

Although it has its ups and downs I really like the final season of Classic, Season 26. Battlefield and The Curse of Fenric really stand out in my opinion although the other two stories are good too. I would also throw in Remembrance of the Daleks from the previous season.

Now that it's here, I love the results we're getting but fucking hell do I worry about defensive solidarity.  You were right on that charge.  I figured we'd do ""better than last season"" with a diamond given the guys we were signing, but I never imagined we'd do this well.

Noble may not have the most speed, but he's not a sprinter; he's an endurance guy.  Long run, he'll be able to move faster than other folks that are still on the pitch after 60 or 70 minutes.  I'd wager he can still have some usefulness in a diamond, given the proper time to acquaint himself with the formation and the attention to squadmates' positions it will require in midfield.  If nothing else, he'd make a hell of an impact sub to a diamond formation when we choose to deploy it.  He's a solid playmaker, but he's also got a keen eye for defense when it's required.  I could see him going wide or to the tip, but Kouyate is too much of a monster in CDM to put him anywhere else.  Speaking of...

Kouyate, I'm not worried about in the slightest.  With his speed he'll be able to move in and out as needed to deal with threats on our goal as necessary.  Again, this is all dependent on him getting properly acquainted with the diamond system, but I think it's quite doable.  Drop him to the base of the diamond -- all set.

Bottom line is, Noble and Kouyate are arguably our two most talented midfielders -- although Downing is doing his damndest to get me to change that opinion.  I don't think a formation change is going to be enough to render them less capable in the squad, if they're intelligently used.  Hypothetically:

Adrian

Cresswell - Tonk - Reid - Jenkinson

Kouyate

Noble - Song

Downing

Valencia - Sakho

One of the strengths of the diamond is that players seem to be almost encouraged to move in or out as needed.  This wreaks havoc on man marking systems, and has a fair bit to do with why Jenko and Cresswell were making charges down the wings; Song or Amalfitano dip in, their marker follows, and there's a wide open lane for our back guys to exploit.  It happened versus Liverpool, and it happened again with QPR.  It's also the source of that defensive concern I have, but as long as our people can maintain possession, there's a lot to be said for it.

Anyway -- this probably could have been formatted better but stream of consciousness happens.  TL;DR: I think Noble and Kouyate could have plenty of place in a diamond, and having options has never hurt us.",0,1412658806,null,0,false,0,cl2lnil,t3_2ihx86,t1_cl2lnil,t3_2ihx86,null,1426647219,2,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,2

The man is an egomaniac. The reason he was disgruntled after last season is because the wider press didn't give him the recognition he felt he deserved. He got the recognition he deserved at City however, winning the player of the year and being idolised by the fans. Also, the reason he kicked up such a stink is because he wanted to force a move for pastures new, laughable that you're naive enough to swallow most of the bullshit he and his agent peddled in an attempt to force us into allowing a move.

The reason people are talking up David's performance on Saturday is because he was consistently brilliant throughout the game. He had the greatest influence on the game, he was the conductor of the whole side.

Yaya on the other hand did nothing for 80 minutes, and then popped up with a goal.

That's precisely why Yaya often doesn't draw the plaudits Silva does: he'll plod through a game contributing little, looking half interested, and maybe nab an important goal. While David will more often than not be consistently good throughout a game, having a major influence on the game throughout, as he did on Saturday.

The racism angle is an utterly pathetic one, and I can't believe you've endorsed it.

It was all about Yaya and to bring out the race card isn't exactly tasteful.  In the same breath of air the same could be said for all of our players including the ones I mentioned (silva, Dzeko) if they were english they would be hailed as gods or would they? Milner is white and English and has been one of our top players and doesn't get credit at all.  Joe Hart has been criticized impartially as well.  All I'm saying is that because we are city we are not going to get love from the media, and we just have to deal with it and not cry about it or try to blame it on race or ethnicity.  The fact that Silva got recognized by a pundit is way past due.  He's been a miracle worker for us and an utter professional and the same can be said for all of our squad.  There is no difference in color or ethnicity at city and we are one of the more diverse teams in the premier league.  I love our squad and Yaya needs to embrace his role or gtfo.  Every player has sacrificed something for the greater good of the team and it's the reason why we are successful as we are.  Last but not least, the only way to get respect from the media is to be consistent and that's what Silva has done...Yaya on the other hand has been a ghost this year so he needs it together and the fruits of his labor will flourish once again.

That was one of the most embarrassing examples of mawkish sentimentality in Matt Smith's run, and I had managed to scrub it from my brain until now. But remember, Smith's Doctor lies. He's well known for it. So when he tells you that he's never met anyone who wasn't important, it's quite possibly the equivalent of patting the stupid ape on the head and saying ""Yes dear, you're very special"". Possibly spelled ""speshul"".

It's also from A Christmas Carol, quite possibly the stupidest Doctor Who episode of all time, including the the one with the Kandyman, at least until this season. Flying sharks. /head-desk

By staying in the family home later, maybe there is a chance that your never going to have as much chance to shoulder life's responsibilities as your going to be locked into a child / parent relationship with out the chance to move fully into ""adult""?

false,nstockto,null,null,"Thank you.

I love your questions. They both required a bit of research. 

One of the reason's for California's massive size (and shape) is the gold rush, which brought bunches and bunches of gringoes (white people from the east) looking for riches. These gringoes wanted California's riches to themselves, but the land belonged to Mexico (recently liberated from Spain). The gringoes fought and won a war against the Mexicans and declared itself a sovereign republic. 

The US wanted California as part of the union, but the US government thought California should draw its eastern border at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains. But, California was so rich that it was in the unique position to write its own ticket into the US. The California government knew that the Sierra Nevada's were loaded with gold, and it wanted all that gold for itself. So, the state said either let us draw our borders east of the mountains, or go F yourself, we'll start our own country. It was kind of a gamble, but it worked. 

Incidentally, the California government was also well aware of its water problems, even back then. Hence, the squiggly line (Colorado River) making up the southeastern border of the state. 

The Colorado River's water resources are allocated among California and six other states according to a huge and ever-growing collection of laws, treaties, and decrees collectively known as ""The Law of the River."" Seriously. That's what it's called. 

According to the law, the river's upper basin cannot be depleted below a certain level. Each of the seven states gets a percentage of the total remaining flow. California's share is over a quarter of the total. This has, and continues to be a huge point of contention, especially between California and Arizona. At one point, Arizona even commissioned a Navy on the Colorado River to stop California from building a dam. The matter wasn't settled until the 60s. 

Basically, California's political weight and total population is such that it, for the most part, got its way with the treaties etc that make up the LOR. In addition to its own share, it gets the surplus share from every other state that uses Colorado River water. California was supposed to develop a plan to curb its use of water resources, but didn't really follow through. Now, because all the other states are starting to grow, there is a lot less surplus water for California to suck up. 

Historically, California has been able to make up the deficit through annual snow pack in the Sierra Nevadas. This snow pack ran down the mountains and into two, huge river systems that converge east of San Francisco and flow into the bay. Those river systems have been dammed up pretty effectively, and were a huge reason for the state's agricultural growth. The water from those rivers also made it south to LA because of the California aqueduct, one of the biggest engineering projects ever. 

However, the big drought has put a bleak horizon on California's water prospects. As mentioned before, the other states it shares the Colorado with are getting bigger, and demanding bigger shares of that river's resources. But, the state's biggest problem is the lack of winter storms, resulting in pitiful amounts of snowpack. Things are looking pretty bleak. 

Please note that both of my explanations are very, very incomplete. History of things in the western US are supremely complicated and make good subjects for selective glossing over (the alternative is a glossing over of your audience's eyes). If you want any aspect of this better clarified, let me know and I'll do my best. Thanks for the questions, they were fun to answer!

TL;DR: California's massive size/cool shape are because it wanted all the gold in the Sierra Nevadas so it drew its borders around them. California gets a huge share of the Colorado because it has historically been a political powerhouse and able to get what it wants.

Please don't attempt banter again. Coming from plastics it really has not effect on m because you're not even a a Chelsea fan. If Abramovich were to have bought Tottenham or Burnley or something you'd be sitting there telling me how you liked them and you've got family members from the area.

Yep, and you know it too. How many posts are there ""New fan from America, I want to root for Chelsea, can somebody tell me the history?"". I'd imagine that was you at one point. 

&gt;No? It's similar to the Porto situation. Don't see them getting shit for having a transfer system.

Porto actually put in a lot of work finding talents in South America.

false,jdhan2006,lfc68,,"I've replied to a few posts regarding GJ and think I should just give my full assessment of him so I don't have anyone misunderstand.  

First off, GJ is one of the most versatile players on the pitch.  He can play either flank and in defense or midfield.  Against WBA I thought he was going to come on for Sterling and protect Manquillo from the midfield.  I also don't think there are too many fullbacks that can shoot as well as he can when he gets in on goal.  That Chelsea goal, that sweet sweet goal against Chelsea will always be my favorite of his.  

Strangely enough he is probably the exact mould of a player Rodgers loves to sign.  An offensive penchant, willingness to get forward and the aforementioned positional variability are all things BR covets.  Also I do like him as a player and will fondly remember him.  

However he has been in terrible form for the past two years.  Offensively he isn't the player he was.  He either lacks the confidence or the ability to get past his man and the turnovers beg for a counterattack down the flank he just vacated.  I understand that a player won't win every duel.  That is ridiculous to think is possible.  But when the success rate is as low as it has been he becomes a liability.  

Defensively he is average.  I say average in the most basic definition.  He is good most of the time.  But when he isn't it is bad.  Real bad.  To be the lead clown in the Barnum and Bailey circus that is our back line is too much.  I'm not singling him out as the only poor defender but he has been the worst.  

Then there is the issue of injuries and age.  He is 30 and last year he was kept out but a cumulation of several different injuries.  (Toe, hamstring and ankle I believe) that toll that has been taken on him has robbed him of some of his speed and explosiveness.  

He can still play.  He is still a premier league defender and probably has a good few years left.  But the issue of wages and decline of play makes it a heavy hearted decision to let him play elsewhere. Even if he were to stay, why would he want to spend the dwindling years playing in the Budweiser Cup when not on the bench?

Yes, they had a choice, but that doesn't mean that the episode was *defending* the idea that killing the giant space wasp *might be the right choice*. It was pretty clearly never meant to be taken as the right choice, it was portrayed as the wrong choice, the bad choice, the choice of fear and ignorance that would *needlessly* sacrifice an innocent baby for no good reason.

Fortunately Clara was around to unilaterally ignore the choice of all humanity. It was her idea to put it up for a vote in the first place, but when the people voted the wrong way, she just ignored them and did what she wanted all along.

The astronaut woman, whatever her name was (did they even give her a name?) made a few half-hearted attempts to argue in favour of destroy the space wasp, but it was pretty clear that the writers weren't really giving that view a fair go. And then the conclusion was so one sided that whatever vague arguments had been made were completely overwhelmed. Oooh, look at the pretty space wasp! And the debris of *millions of trillions of moon rock* just harmlessly disintegrated for no reason. And a new moon magically appeared! Nobody was killed, nobody was hurt, nobody was even inconvenienced.

When Prime Minister Harriot Jones blew the Sycorax (spelling?) out of the sky, after the Doctor let them go with a warning, that was a real dilemma. Because both Jones and the Doctor were right. The Doctor had shown mercy which is all right and proper, but Jones was right too, the Doctor will not always be around and now some really bad aliens who just tried to invade and mind-controlled (oh, sorry, ""blood-controlled"") millions of people won't ever do it again. Justice is served and the Sycorax will be a warning to others. They're both right. Life is hard. Choices are hard, and whatever you choose, there are consequences. There were no consequences here.

Just be careful. You may have no trouble in paying loans back at the minute. But you do need to consider what would happen if your circumstances change whilst you have the loan. 

Can you do anything to reduce the loan amount? If you want to buy the car in a years time, use the year to save money every month to put towards the car. You could almost reduce the size of the loan by a around third by doing this.

Example:

Save £350 for 12 months = £4200.

Total Car Cost = £15,000

Loan for £10,800

Do what you can to avoid taking a loan. If you can't (or don't want) to avoid it, do what you can to reduce the total loan amount. Save the amount you want to put towards repayments will also allow you to get used to not having that money to spend on other things. It will demonstrate whether the repayment amount is practical.

On a side note - when you are closer to getting the loan, a post to /r/ukpersonalfinance may be of benefit to help you find the best deal, and get some more advice.

You don't understand the original intent. You say it's obvious but you've made frequent self-admitted assumptions and wild extrapolations. Somehow these flights of fancy are obvious ?

You also accuse me of being patronising but nothing is further from the truth. My first response to OP was illustrating the fact that he knows there is a problem but isn't doing anything but criticise the attempted solution. I was trying to prompt OP to think about also trying to help solve the problem rather than criticise from the sidelines.

I've come across many, many people in my career who would rather criticise the attempts of others rather than take action themselves. I've [usually pointed them to this quote](http://artofabeautifullife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/man-in-the-arena.jpg) in the hope of changing their mindset.

In short : OP stop being a cold and timid soul, forget the critics and go and get stuck into the problem. You'll enjoy it.

Even if they do make them available as soon as possible rather than waiting for all, it'll depend on the format you can load. Some formats can be made by just cramming together the live broadcast (concat HLS stream segments), but others need full re-encoding. NowTV may not play the easy to generate ones.

Long live broadcasts take time to encode at all the various bitrates and formats that they need for so many different devices &amp; connections, and they're not the only thing in the queue.

Anger at perceived injustice is an understandable starting point. You may not agree with their view, you almost certainly will not agree with their subsequent reasoning, but anger, in general terms, is a feeling we have all felt and should be able to empathise with. In this case we might assume that the anger in question is at Western involvement in the Middle East. Is it really that unreasonable for a small number of people who are themselves from, or have family from, the region to be angry also. Bear in mind that all but the tiniest minority felt that the action taken was completely wrong. 
Is the phrase: 

""Yeah, well I don't particularly like what the British Armed forces are doing in Iraq, but I sure as fuck wouldn't blow myself up on a train full of innocent people to stop it"" 

not a reasonable one. 

Fear is another possibility. Who's to say these people were not under considerable pressure from elsewhere? 

How about mental illness? There has to be a certain amount of disassociation from reality involved for someone to decide to blow themselves up, let alone hundreds of others.   

I'm really not trying to defend the bombers' actions. Literally no-one is.  I just dispute the assertion that having any amount of sympathy for their ""cause"" or trying to understand why they might have done it, makes someone else as bad as them.

But I'll throw another idea into the mix: try buying things *only* when you have a need for them. I've been doing this a lot recently and have found that I don't really need half the stuff I have. 

For example, I thought I needed a large wardrobe for clothes and was pricing up some Ikea Pax wardrobes with all the snazzy extra bits, pants hanger, wire baskets, wooden drawers, etc. The ""solution"" was coming in well over £500. I then decided I'd try and see what clothes I was actually wearing. My clothes went into 3 piles; I put all my clothes in the first pile, and as things were worn and washed they would go into a second pile. After a couple of weeks I went through the first pile and pulled out things I would need for next season (it was summer so I pulled out winter clothes), tried them on, and if they fit they went into a 3rd pile. I used a couple vacuum storage bags to shrink next season's clothes, and then charity-shop'd the first pile. I wasn't wearing them, and I have an emergency fund to buy anything I need as I need it, so could replace anything pretty quickly. As it turned out, I was using maybe 20% of my clothes on a regular basis, with another 10% specific winter items. Everything now hangs on a small ikea STOLMEN system that set me back around £120, but which is adjustable and reconfigurable, and more importantly is ""open"", meaning I can't hide things away – out of sight, out of mind, as they say.

This thinking has leaked through to the rest of the house; I don't bother with bed-side tables, the things that would go in the drawers go in plastic tubs on an extension to the STOLMEN shelving I'd purchased to hang clothes. I don't have chests of drawers, my clothes are on hangers or in tubs. I've given over 300 books to charity and now have everything on a kindle, and my DVD collection has gone, so no book cases. I have only one or two ornaments in the living room, and I have a carefully curated selection of kitchen utensils. Reducing the amount of ""stuff"" in my life has been really refreshing.

I heard on a podcast a little while ago (although haven't been able to find anything else to back this up) that in Italy, if you are out of work you can claim unemployment benefit every week/month as usual or take the sum of 2 years allowance in a lump sum to use in the start up of a co-op business.  The idea being this would then create jobs for other people as well as providing yourself with work and a source of income.

As I said, I couldn't find anything to back it up, but it's a hell of an idea if implemented properly.  By that I mean rather than just giving anyone a lump some with the hope they succeed, I imagine it work more like a business loan, having to provide some sort of business plan that is monitored to make sure the money is spent correctly.

There's a few obvious things you need, but you are never quite sure what you need until you've been living there a while.  It can help avoid those white elephants (things you thought you needed but then didn't really).

Over the years I've replaced stuff that I really needed with good quality stuff where it made sense and just got rid of some of stuff I didn't need. I suspect i would have wasted a lot of money if I'd gone out with a big budget when I first moved in, e.g., I started with a shitty £20 canvas wardrobe and eventually bought a nice double wardrobe in a sale.  At this point I saved cash and had a reasonable idea what my requirements were.  I'm guessing I probably would have spent more buying a too large or too small wardrobe around the time I moved in.  

Similarly I bought lots of super cheap (£10-£20) flat pack book shelves and later replaced these with nicer stuff that I found over the years.

One exception for me was the bed.  I bought a good one up front and am still using it 15 years later.  I'm glad I did that.

I'm not sure my examples are very good but I hope my point is clear.  You can take the pressure off by being a cheapskate now (plenty of examples how in this thread) and then hopefully save money in the long run buying what you actually need and want.

A counter argument is that if you have a pretty good idea what you need now you can get it all out of the way now and not have to worry in the coming years.

The problem is that they're already available extremely easily.  Dealers don't care about who they sell to so children can get hold of both soft and hard drugs, often more easily than they can tobacco and alcohol. No-one ever got carded buying illegal drugs.

The key benefit of legalising and regulating *all* drugs is so that we can take control of the situation, put proper regulation into effect and shut down the black market.  Drugs should be of pharmaceutical grade, produced and sold under strict licensing conditions, heavily taxed to deter use (but not so heavily as to allow the black market to undercut it), not advertised or marketed to minors (or at all), and so on.  

All these things are necessary if we want to put an end to the harmful effects of drug abuse (and as a side-effect, restoring the rights of adults to make their own informed decisions about what substances they choose to ingest).

Acne is often not solely caused only by one thing, tho there can certainly be one trigger as with pregnancy/ birth. Then of course we change our skincare and lifestyle, or the seasons may change and one or more other factors continue to aggravate the problem.

Whilst acne has an infectious element, there is also an inflammatory element, and there may well be some issue with skin barrier function (keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out). It can be useful to work on the health of the skin inside and out, and to work on strengthening the skin barrier, not only focusing on destructive techniques or ingredients. Do not scrub at, overexfoliate or overcleanse your skin.

Cystic acne generally does not respond well to topical treatments, so if you still have the cystic form you may well need an oral treatment. As per my private message NHS should be referring you to a dermatologist if you are getting scarring and/ or it is affecting your quality of life/ mental health. It might also be useful to have your hormones tested if they will do this.

If the severity has subsided there are various topical treatments from 15%+ azaleic acid to 4% niacinamide (AKA nicotinamide) that an NHS doctor can prescribe, often in combination with a topical or oral antibiotic and/ or benzoyl peroxide.You would likely have tried and failed with BP if you have had a raft of over the counter remedies. I'm confess I am prejudiced against it - damages the barrier function.

In *Victory of the Daleks*, the Doctor asks Amy to tell Churchill that the Daleks are dangerous aliens. She has no idea what he's talking about: she's never seen or heard about Daleks before. The Doctor is expecting her to remember the Dalek invasion at the end of season four, but she does not.

This is because the Dalek invasion of Earth — and presumably every other RTD-era alien encounter that made it onto the news — has been swallowed up by season five's cracks and forgotton by the human race.

That leaves two Moffat-era stories where aliens make it onto contemporaryish Earth news:

- *The Eleventh Hour* — you could argue that the Atraxi ultimately get swallowed up by the cracks as well
- *The Power of Three* — this actually occurs a few years in our future, with the Doctor only popping in to see Amy and Rory every few months

Clara doesn't remember any alien invasions, Danny doesn't remember any alien invasions, Clara expects Danny won't believe her if she tells him the truth.

On top of which, Clara desperately wants to keep the ex-soldier and the man who hates soldiers well away from each other.

Clara bullshitting Danny with a story about a play was the last desperate act by a control freak who'd lost control.

When does Clara slap the Doctor?

So to complete @ £125,000 we would need:

- mortgage deposit £11,500 (90% LTV mortgage of £115,000)
- cash payment £10,000
- fees + costs £3,000

so the cash we needed to have on hand increased from ~£15k (which we have) to ~£25k (which we don't have). It was simply just not possible for us. We did ask the vendor if they were willing to drop the selling price but they would prefer to re-market for a cash buyer or something.

Though, *even if we did have £24k*, much better for us to pull out and get an 85% mortgage somewhere else or a 90% mortgage on a more expensive property.
