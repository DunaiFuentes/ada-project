How can time be interpreted so differently for different people in the dream? Well it's quite simple, I've had dreams with time-skips before. I don't actually have memories of what happened during the time-skip yet I act like I do. When necessary memories are made up on the spot by the dream, the memory is just as projected as a dream is.

The only reason I even realize that the memory is false after having woken up is because the memory only makes sense with the dream and not with reality, the memory feels that real so time-skipping and putting false memories in to fill the blanks is enough to make it feel like you've been there ""all day"" when you've only been there for five minutes. Or in an extreme case a lifetime but you don't actually have memories that add up to that, you only get necessary details when you try to think about it during a dream, you're simply fooled into believing it was a lifetime worth of memories.

A Conservative government will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal the hunting act on a free vote, with a government bill in government time.” 

Why is it unworkable? AFAIK it's workable so long as nobody makes criminals of themselves by breaking the law. 

&gt; He said: “What we need is an overall majority to enable the Conservatives to deliver this otherwise we will not. This is something that I and many people in the countryside believe in. It is a matter of freedom and livelihood and should be put right.” 

AFAIK it's still legal to control foxes etc. on country land but *not* to hunt them in certain ways. Livelihoods can absolutely be preserved, they just can't torture the fox whilst doing it. 

&gt; Labour has sought to use the hunting issue to portray the Conservatives, and the Prime Minister personally, as preoccupied with the concerns of a privileged elite, and out of touch with wider public opinion. 

Well it's entirely possible to focus on a number of manifesto points at the same time - but in the interests of animal well-fare I do hope the Tories fail on so many levels for this.

false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"First off, last season we had the luxury of having a small, tight, driven squad who didn't have the distraction of European play and the only *real* goal was to grab a 4th place spot for the Champions League. We clearly overachieved.

I think the answer to 'where did we go wrong' is actually pretty clear and simple: We lost Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge.

They were the two top goal-scorers in the League last season and their loss really exposed the inability for other players to score goals as well as our defence.

Considering our resources and our ability to attract top (top!) players, I think we did as well as we could in the transfer window.

Unfortunately, you can't expect everyone to come together as a *team* all at once. You can't expect individuals to suddenly make a magical impact on the squad (not everyone is like Luis Suarez or Diego Costa or Daniel Sturridge; This should really highlight how special those sorts of players are).

Now, couple all of that with the natural pressure of being on a big club that was mere points away from the title? It's difficult. We're not playing fantasy football where we just quantify the skill of a player with numbers, slot them into a squad and expect success. They're not robots. They are human beings who are adjusting to a new team, a new city, a new league, a new culture. Sometimes it takes time to adjust.

But the reality is that there were a lot of significant changes in our squad from this season and last season (again, mostly the departure of Suarez and the injury to Sturridge) and now here we are.

Not to say that I'm OK with our position now or that I expected this... I think the unfortunate thing that happened was that the worst case scenario that we feared actually happened: Sturridge suffered a long layoff with his injury and we have certainly missed his goal-scoring ability especially in the absence of Suarez. Balotelli was a gamble and, at the moment, we've lost that one. Of the many signings, you would hope that just *one* plays out of his mind and makes an immediate impact from the start... but that hasn't happened either.

As for being wistful about the players we let go...

* Suarez has made only 11 appearances - out of 24 matches - for Barcelona. I'm sure Suarez is happy to accept the challenge of becoming a regular in the Barcelona side... he surely would have started nearly every single match for Liverpool and probably would have 10+ goals already instead of the 3 he has for Barca at the moment. But this isn't really *our* fault per se.
* Agger has only made 8 appearances for Brondy at the moment (not sure if it's due to injury) but that suggests to me that Agger would struggle to either make our side and/or be unable to be relied upon to face the rigors of regular starts in the Premier League.
* As Downing, I think he simply found a club that fit him. A club where he could get regular opportunities, be allowed to continue to play through the purple patch here and there, be more of the centerpiece of the attack (hence, more opportunities, hence 4 goals and 6 assists to date).

It is certainly a frustrating situation but I think going forward it's important to realize that we signed the best players we could in the window and these very human footballers simply need more time than we thought/hoped to make a clear impact on the team.

One is a large scale logistical operation (a hunt is no small thing - think a score or more of horseback riders, a dozen dogs and a large number of supporting vehicles that will follow them around the countryside). It takes some planning. It takes some preparation. 

Drugs are a lot more covert. You could be hiding a few grammes of coke in your house right now and I might come in, look around a bit and never know - I could certainly walk past you in the street and never know. Then there's the production lines etc. and actual supply of the stuff. It's a different beast. 

Then there's some of the effects...

Does hunting harm / terrify / torture wildlife? More than likely. It's not clean killing. It's blood sport for a reason.. 

Do drugs harm people? Again more than likely - but in different ways. Harming people is not the *point* of drugs however - at their best they are designed to be enjoyable, not harmful, although misuse will result in harmful effects and these could be said to be self inflicted. 

We could get sidetracked by arguing about drugs here... they're a grey area in themselves as they're so different from one another. 

So let's bring it round to *why there's a law for it*. The idea of the law in this context is not to pick on things that are easy to catch, but to make sure people *can* be prosecuted for their crimes. 

Would I know that you're a paedophile if I passed you in the street? Hell no. But the law *could* prosecute you for your crimes if they catch you. That's how it ought to be with fox hunting. Sure it might not be easy to constantly police for hunts - but if you do find one operating illegally then you *can* prosecute. 

Or are they saying 'well, it's too hard to find these guys so we're going to give up trying'. Where could that end if they took that approach to other crimes? ",0,1419587591,null,0,false,0,cn5odd9,t3_2qfktr,t1_cn5odd9,t1_cn5o8t4,null,1425211769,31,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,31

Well, not ruined. That's a bit dramatic.

But I do believe - in a very general sense - that games like FIFA, Fantasy Premier League, Football Manager, etc. has distilled a footballer down to bits of quantifiable data and makes footballers more like robots as opposed to actual humans.

Yes, I'm disappointed that some of the new signings have not made as big and immediate impact as I would have hoped... but I think a lot of *humanity* comes into play as well...

Balotelli, for example, is made to feel a victim which is mostly his fault and partly the media's fault but ultimately that impacts the way he plays the game.

Borini is *only* 23-years-old and he always seems to be the player that is good enough to *want* on your squad but never good enough to be able to *stay* on a squad. What does that do to do the mentality of a kid who left his home in Italy at 16 to Chelsea, loaned to Swansea after a season with Chelsea, loaned to Roma, signed to Liverpool and then loaned to Sunderland after a season only to return from a relatively successful season to languishing on the bench. To me, it speaks to Borini's character and mental strength that he hasn't just said, 'fuck it' and given up on being a professional footballer.

Ultimately, I guess the point of my rambling, long-winded post is that we shouldn't be pessimistic.

Chin up!

If you have had previous success on Football Manager, that doesn't suddenly mean you became shit in recent times.

People of working age gravitate towards areas of economic activity, which may include other countries cities but would also likely include French cities too.

France is not very well liked by the media for various reasons, but they have around the same population as us and a similar sized economy. Funnily enough not every country seems to need a massive housing bubble in order to function.. 

Hollande hasn't really done anything except raise a few token taxes. Raising income tax isn't going to suddenly erase the French economy, the only real difference it makes is a bit more creative accounting by many individuals to move the income around, and either more or less tax receipts. People still do business in France because it's profitable, the tax rates are irrelevant especially when they're so easily skirted around.

Don't worry, we will drop back below France once our housing bubble blows up again. We're far too reliant on house prices for our GDP growth for us to ever pull ahead of them for long.

I am not saying this is the end of Baines, or he should be full on dropped, but knowing he is not invincible, whilst giving his legs a bit of a rest should hopefully spark him to get back to his best in the new year. And if Garbutt comes in and does a job well, then he will be an amazing rotation option (especially if Bobby sticks with putting Oviedo on the wing) when out fixtures get rough again. 

I think all it would take is another 6 games from now to the end of the year to keep Garbutt happy, and next year we can grow that to 10, then a few more (if he has the quality we all believe he does), so as Baines gets a bit older (and maybe moves centrally?) we will have long term cover.

I think you failed to grasp the basics of my post. London gets more spent on it than the entire UK combined. Lets say we bump up your figure to say 15 million people to include the commuters. That's 15 million people getting more spent on them than the other 45 million people in the UK. Or if you want to do percentages 25% of the UK population gets more spent on them than the other 75%. 

As for London being the cash cow of the UK, lets ignore the financial service (as that's where the lions share of money comes from). What else would you expect when you're constantly pumping tens of billions of pounds in to the local economy to stimulate it. That's just simply not happening in the rest of the UK were they're fighting one another for a couple of million pound here and there.

false,elbruce,wardr,Hurt,"My current headcanon on this is that Santa Claus (in the Doctor Who universe) can appear in any dream-induced state that involves his bailiwick: either the North Pole (geographically) and/or Christmas (timewise).  If anybody is in an induced dream state involving either that place or time, he can show up and try to help.  He doesn't have external physical existence; he only exists in dream-realities, and only shows up in those that fit his story (North Pole, Christmas).  However, he is immune to things that affect anyone else, being not physically ""real"" himself.

He struck me as sort of an opposite version of Freddy Krueger: a native denizen of the dream-world, who serves as a savior and hero, when and where he can.  And who also hands out tangerines.  Which (although per his elves, nobody likes) can sometimes cross into physical reality.

I also appreciated that they didn't try to make Santa a clearly physically real person who actually lives at the magnetic or geographic north pole (both of which I believe are underwater at present) and rather kept him more of a mythical/magical figure throughout, without having to either explain or deny it.  But to be honest, I didn't really expect them to do anything more than that.

Then again, the entire point of this episode is to leave us wondering what is ""real"" at all.  What does ""reality"" mean?  If Moffat says Santa is ""real"" in an episode that entirely questions the very nature of reality, then he isn't really saying anything at all.

*In addition...*

Clara thought she lived a full and complete life.  She was cool with that.  As any of us mortals should be.  Then the Doctor's like ""woop, you're still young!"" and then she has/gets to start over.  Fuck, if I could have a Timelord take me from 75 back to 25 years of age, that'd be fucking awesome.  But that part kind of bugged me out, because I thought they were going to value human lifetimes and experience (which you and I have to go through), making her life sound like a full and rich life well lived... 

...and then instead they said said ""fuck it, let's just delete all that life-lived and mortality bullshit that all our viewers have to deal with in their own lives, after confronting them with it, and just get her back to being a hot young sidekick going on random adventures.""

It's like they started to make a point that middle-aged or older people could empathize with, and then randomly curbstomped that entire concept as soon as we started taking it seriously.  Because *fuck* life experience.  *Fuck* the entire life that Clara lived; we don't give a shit about the apparently OK life she lived (and therefore, we don't give a shit about her).

The alcohol health alliance's demands then

* A minimum price of at least 50p per unit of alcohol should be introduced for all alcohol sales, together with a mechanism to regularly review and revise this price.At least one third of every alcohol product label should be given over to an evidence-based health warning specified by an independent regulatory body.



* ***The sale of alcohol in shops should be restricted to specific times of the day and designated areas***. No alcohol promotion should occur outside these areas.

* The tax on every alcohol product should be proportionate to the volume of alcohol it contains. In order to incentivise the development and sale of lower strength products, the rate of taxation should increase with product strength.

* Licensing legislation should be comprehensively reviewed. Licensing authorities must be empowered to tackle alcohol-related harm by controlling the total availability of alcohol in their jurisdiction.

* ***All alcohol advertising and sponsorship should be prohibited. In the short term, alcohol advertising should only be permitted in newspapers and other adult press. Its content should be limited to factual information about brand, provenance and product strength.***

* An independent body should be established to regulate alcohol promotion, including product and packaging design, in the interests of public health and community safety.


* The legal limit for blood alcohol concentration for drivers should be reduced to 50 mg/100ml.All health and social care professionals should be trained to routinely provide early identification and brief alcohol advice to their clients.

* People who need support for alcohol problems should be routinely referred to specialist alcohol services for comprehensive assessment and appropriate treatment.

That seems something of an extreme example. Where do you stand on Sharia courts? On one hand, private agreement for third part arbitration is acceptable even if they use a religious basis for it. On the other hand, there's anecdotal evidence that they're sexist and people are pressured into using them even if they're not fair.

There's plenty of places that would be considered libertarian that most certainly do not turn out to be the wonderland Libertarian advocates say they will be.

I used to have a similar view to yours, I believed the way forward was for each area to operate semi-independently of a central state, trading within themselves and taking care of their own affairs, but you know what?

This isn't about that, though. If it's really about countryside management then there should be a consultation involving gamekeepers and farm managers. Most of whom would *probably* say that hunting with dogs and all the rituals surrounding it aren't effective countryside management and can do a lot of damage to crops, gates, hedges and fences, as well as flushing areas of birds.

If I may generalise from self a little, I live in a rural area and am strongly against fox hunting, but not countryside management. For example, there's a need for more deer to be culled around here, because the numbers of them mean they're ring-barking trees to a large extent and are a serious common hazard on the roads.

Think of it like this: In some surreal dreams you have a character who has to make choices in their dream; each time they make what they think is the right choice, their dream changes and whole new context and new choices have to be made under different conditions.

What in effect is happening with the above choices, is that IF a choice were made people would then look to see what that choice would then cause and then THAT itself would feed-back to re-assessing that first choice IF made.

This is very much imo how it works.

Now, this odd example if you are able to consider it to this point, boils down using the above to the only condition where Brexit operates and breaks that conditional-loop ie matches all the necessary conditions is Efta/EEA - and the character in the above dream wakes up finally.

Therefore DC machines powered by an AC/DC motor generator were the preferred solution. The MG set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, **thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.**

Better player selection from Rodgers the last two games. He just needs to talk to the press a bit less now. Anything he says is selectively parsed and headlined. If he can continue to pull himself out of the funk he is in that would be great for all.

I think you've shot yourself in the foot by putting the monarchy into their historical perspective, because, as other in this thread have pointed out, they only have this property because their distant ancestors took it by force, going back ultimately to William the Conqueror and his feudal thugs. They have not worked for it or maintained it and therefore have no moral right to it whatsoever. All those properties rightfully belong to the British working class who built and have maintained them. So all your talk of Civil lists is irrelevant. The question is, *by what right* do they own these things, and rule over us? The answer is, they have no right to at all. Talk about presidents, tourism, civil lists, and all the rest of it, is just irrelevant. 

We should not be ruled over by unelected aristocrats who live in privilege and idleness and who we have to support, in one case for as long as 101 years. It's not just non-democratic, it's anti-democratic. It sets a bad example of laziness and greed. 

All this talk of the Queen being ""an ambassador"" is complete tosh. The reality is that she does nothing but read the odd speech now and then, written for her by someone else. Her and her family are the living embodiment and repository of unearned privilege and the most nasty reactionary ideas.

""Conversely, BMI may lead to misclassification of persons with normal levels of fat as being overweight, a fact that could cause unnecessary distress and prompt to unnecessary and costly interventions. In addition, such mislabeling has a deleterious effect on public trust for healthcare providers, particularly from fit patients with evident preserved muscle mass.""

Overall BMI classifies a lot of obese people as being normal or overweight. Which means that BMI makes our society to appear healthier than it actually is. But it also classifies a minority of healthy people as being overweight or obese.

Also, important to note, Clara seemed to only be apt to leave because Danny was worried about her. Now that Danny is dead.... I really enjoy this ""Time Travel as an addiction"" motif they're doing so it makes sense that it's hard for Clara to really shut the book on the TARDIS. Now that Danny is dead who else does she have? Danny and Clara did this awkward-nothing-special relationship so well. I feel like this season was grounded in a way NewWho has never been and it's emotional heart was the Pink/Oswald relationship, as well as the Doctor realizing he can't do everything for her and that the relationship between the two has forever changed. I really enjoy the fact that Clara didn't leave. We would have seen it coming from the start of the season. I feel this ""loss at Xmas"" thing is becoming a big trope in Who and Clara's goodbye would be so much more poignant if it happened mid season 9. I don't like to be proved right in my television.

Working class did not build this country, the middle did. If it was not for this middle, democracy would not flourish. The one thing the middle understands was you link between progression and tradition. Our system shows that. 

&gt; We should not be ruled over by unelected aristocrats who live in privilege and idleness and who we have to support, in one case for as long as 101 years. It's not just non-democratic, it's anti-democratic. It sets a bad example of laziness and greed.

I disagree, because your trying to argue that democracy will get rid of these things but it doesn't democracy makes, Greed and laziness acceptable. The monarchy has these thing but has to work hard or will lose it. This makes it working. The less power the monarchs had its actually done better. 

&gt; All this talk of the Queen being ""an ambassador"" is complete tosh. The reality is that she does nothing but read the odd speech now and then, written for her by someone else. Her and her family are the living embodiment and repository of unearned privilege and the most nasty reactionary ideas.

It's real and all you have to do is look around, our country and her are respected by the International community. No other commands such respect.

These dream crabs are animalistic, from what we've seen. Although, they are very powerful because they're able to create a telepathic field to allow multiple people from different points in space and time to share the same dream. And now we know that the Dream Crabs inhabit 21st century Earth. So why didn't they attack more people, or even the entire population?

One thing I've found is that the show doesn't often handle a sense of presence well. Casing point; some episodes that should have been isolated have throwaway lines that let us know that it is happening all over the world. Vice versa, episodes that should have been grand usually play to the claustrophobic nature of the show. Take Death in Heaven for instance. Missy pulled out a gadget that showed Cybermen all across the world, yet we spent almost the entire duration of the episode in one graveyard - and as a result, despite an excellent start, the episode's pacing started to drag.

If anyone can tell me why the Dream Crabs attacked just those few isolated individuals and not an entire population (as they definitely had the means to do so and let's face it, not everybody would have been with the Doctor and so would never have realised they were dreaming) without resorting to just saying 'they're animalistic', then I'd really appreciate it.",0,1419612307,null,0,false,0,cn5u3lp,t3_2qdvmq,t1_cn5u3lp,t1_cn5qgat,null,1425209085,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

As for your questions:

1) The people he recruited were people who owed him a favour, People that could bring force to the situation as you said. I don't think the doctor would want to endanger his friends in this way. He brings 2 whole armies to use and then a selection of individuals he needed. Strax for his battle-born mind, Vastra for her intelligence and leadership, Dorian for his knowledge of the computer system. As some other people said Moffat did want Jack to come but thats probably because Moffat is quite proud of his own creations.

2) He feels a lot of guilt about his past companions and how he affected their lives which is why he doesn't visit him. In a Sarah Jane Adventures episode (Death of the Doctor) it talks about how Tennant's Doctor looked back on all/most of his companions from the past 700 years or so and how proud he was. The Doctor very rarely looks back on his life because no matter what he has to move forward and let them get on with their own lives.

Nice point with the flesh people, I never noticed that.

Of course this is just how I see the situation connected with other reasons seen throughout the show.

Pelle wasn't really in it which is a shame.

I think we looked good the whole game shame about the goal but after we scored we looked a bit rubbish for the first half playing the long ball but the second half we didn't. Passing it around looked quality. 

Nice to see the youngsters begin blooded. JWP set pieces were on point. Nice to see Davies being the captain also Morgan. :)

Forster looked good didn't do anything wrong nice to see a keeper catch the ball he also bullied some people off the ball which was good.

Walker was absolutely terrible, I'm going to put that down to his recent recovery from the injury. 

As I said in the match thread, Capoue needs to start. He's very good at shielding the back four and a great passer of the ball. Way too many passes were incomplete from our midfield. A lot of attacking play was stifled in the midfield. 

Our attacking four are pretty silky. They're working well together which is great to see.

He's still a world-class shot stopper, you could see him going after shots that Brad Jones wouldn't even had tried to dive to.

If Jones stays injured, I hope Mignolet can improve his confidence and become a 100% reliably keeper again. 
I do agree however that we need to buy another goalkeeper.

JWP is such a breath of fresh air on set pieces and just moving down the right side. Put the ball in for Mane, corner for Alderweireld. Lots of great build-up by him. Still my favorite player :)

Mane, first good game by him. Gets his head up now, and still uses his pace. Think he looks much better playing inside partnering with Pelle than out wide. Lets him use his pace a bit more to get in behind the defenders. Improvement, but I still think Long fits our system better.

Alderweireld had a great game, capitalised with a goal. I was thinking of this during the game but he is a key cog in our system. The main reason is the starting line up Koeman put out. If the 3-5-2 (or 5-3-2 whatever you want to call it) wasn't working we could've easily switched back to a 4-2-3-1 by moving Alderweireld to the midfield and Davis up to center.

Baines looked lively again, but other than that, there are few positives we can take out of it. 

Lukaku is just not a lone striker, he drops too deep so we have no crossing opportunity and we completely lack the change of tempo that did so well for us last season. When we get into the final third there is the same energy in passing and movement as when we are passing it around the defence. We are essentially saying 'guys, you are good at the back, get yourselves into position so we can't break you down'.

We need that energy and spark, that willingness to make a mistake- but the confidence to pull it off that we had in abundance last year. i mentioned it after last weeks game, and it was even more apparent here... It seems that the only thing on players minds is 'don't lost the ball', and that leads to slow and predictable passing. 

Glad to see Stonsie back, but not if Jags is out for long and for all his flaws, Howard makes Joel look like Dino Zoff. If we take those two out, and Mirallas is also sidelined things are only going to get worse. 

Did decisions go against us? Yes, but even so- Stoke kept a clean sheet vs us at Goodison and we didn't even test their keeper, who looked bloody hungover he was so shaky. This is a game we should have won convincingly, even with the ref against us.. If Southampton B can do it against us, we should be able to do it against Stoke.

If that's the case and Skrtel makes two plus mistakes a game that could legitimately cost us a goal while we're doing that already, does it not make sense to try someone else out in the formation?

No one seems to acknowledge that Brendan was using a formation last year that is extremely rare in how much it asks of every defender. Vincent Kompany, who is frequently considered one of (if not) the best CBs in the world has been protected by two world class DMs (who happen to also be adept going forward) for years. We really are the only top club without a world class CM/DM. That our CBs have looked the worse for it shouldn't really surprise anyone. 

Skrtel, comparatively, makes more mistakes that lead to goal scoring opportunities than Lovren. Lovren's problem tended to revolve around poor outlet passing (read: immobile CMs...) and moments where he'd come too far to make a tackle (read: our two fullbacks are always bombed up the field for Rodgers...and our DM was incapable of helping CBs in any meaningful way defensively...) and have no one able to cover him because 9 of our players were in the opposition half and Gerrard has no ability to track back.

Honestly, Lovren's failures have little to do with coaching and more to do with not having the players who fit Rodgers system to a T. We carry both he and Lucas through games and that invariably makes the whole system come apart.

false,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"&gt;Why can't we score off of corners? I only remember one time when we were successful, and I don't know what the league average is of scoring off of corners, but I'm certain it's higher than one in a season

Distribution was the problem, today it was finishing. Baines actually put his best dead ball performance in for a fair while- but Barry missed a stone wall chance in the first half, and there were a number more we should have done better with. It is also really hard to score from a corner- I think the PL average over the past few years is about 25 corners per goal.. Of course ours is worse than that. 

&gt;Why do we seem so hesitant in pushing up? Lately, I've noticed we get the ball to midfield then pass back. Seems to me we only push forward when Lukaku gets open.

I feel this is down to lack of confidence. It is something I have talked about for a fair bit this season, and is costing us more and more with each game. We are slow to move the ball around, and slow to push up. Players fall back on the 'philosophy of Martinez' when things aren't going well, and that is a philosophy where retaining the ball is key. This is great when players have the confidence to alter the tempo of the game, but shit when they don't.

&gt;Why are players in ""wrong"" positions? I've read on here that many of you complain about Roberto's choices for certain players in certain positions, but I don't know if some of you know something that Roberto doesn't, or if that is the supporter giving out?

Injuries and Martinez's commitment to certain players. Barkley and Naismith for example are both central players- if Lukaku is up top (where Naismith can play) then there is no way Rossy and Naisey should play on the pitch together. They are both great down the middle (in different ways), but horrible on the flanks.

It seems though that because Naismith has been so good for us, Martinez is a bit scared to drop him... But also there isn't much of a better option due to injuries and a fair number of players that aren't good enough. We need to play someone on the right, so it is either a shitty player or a good player out of position, and Martinez seems to choose the latter. 

&gt;With our lack of play as of the last few games in the EPL, do you think the time has come to oust Roberto Martinez? I don't know what the average tenure for a manager is, and I am always willing to give a manager a chance.

No. We are not going to get Klopp, and I still believe Martinez has the right idea. Things do need to change, and if we are still playing 5 4 foot passes to get the ball to the flanks, then he does need to go... But I know that he isn't some joker who got lucky, he is a man who understands football way better than I do, and compared to our other options (Alan Curbishley? Big Sam?) he is a diamond. 

He was lauded as the future Barca manager over the summer, and he is still the same manager- even great teams, with great managers have rough spots. This is no worse than a fair number of seasons with Moyes, and we always worked it out under him.

false,Everton_11,crest,Bill's Brown Bomber,"1) Scoring from set pieces isn't really part of Martinez's philosophy.  Crosses into the box are generally pretty wasteful, especially with poor deliveries, and wasting possession is not part of his philosophy. And the service into the box from corners has been poor the last month or so.

2) Again, this is part of Martinez's philosophy. Don't play risky forward passes when you can pass back and keep the ball. This is all fine and good when there's plenty of time, or when you're ahead. When you're down a goal, with 20 to play, you need to take some risks.

3) Due to injuries, form, and fatigue, our outside wide players, Mirallas, McGeady, Pienaar, etc. are not playing.  This leads to A line of Naismith, Eto'o, and Barkley playing behind Lukaku.  All three of those players play best directly behind the striker, and only one can play there. The others are forced out wide, where they try to cut inside, instead of stretching defenses by staying out wide.  This is less of an issue if the fullbacks get forward, and stretch the defense that way, but recently, this hasn't worked, for various reasons.

4) No. Absolutely not. Everton is not a club that fires our managers unless we are in serious, serious trouble. Since we were founded in 1878, we've had, I believe, 14 permanent managers. Real Madrid and Chelsea have had that many since 2000. This team has talent, we know that. We have the ability to challenge for the top four, we proved that last season.

Final salary and CARE schemes for example give you membership rather than fund value, so it can be harder to gauge actual value.

&gt;__0__ (__zero__; [BrE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English): /ˈzɪərəʊ/ or [AmE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English): /ˈziːroʊ/) is both a [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number)  and the [numerical digit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit) used to represent that number in [numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system).

&gt;It fulfills a central role in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) as the [additive identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_identity) of the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer), [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number), and many other [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra) structures. As a digit, 0 is used as a placeholder in [place value systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation). [Names for the number 0 in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_the_number_0_in_English) include __zero__, __nought__ or (US) __naught__ (/ˈnɔːt/), __nil__, or — in contexts where at least one adjacent digit distinguishes it from the letter ""O"" — __oh__ or __o__ (/ˈoʊ/). Informal or slang terms for zero include __zilch__ and __zip__.  *Ought* or *aught* (/ˈɔːt/) has also been used historically.

Are you actually able to defend UKIP without simultaneously making them look like the worst kind of populist leeches ever? Probably not.

The thing with Labour and the Conservatives is very few of their own voters support 100% of everything they are and do. UKIP appears to attract cultists who think that their political party is 100% perfect and should be above criticism, and that any negative media story about them is clearly a conspiracy by the immigrants/jews/NWO/muslims. Contrast that to the Tories, even their supporter papers will often criticize Conservative policy, or corrupt dealings. Same with Labour and their supporting papers. Why is it so difficult for UKIP supporters to act the same way?

Schurrle tracks back almost as much too, but he's at least got something helping up in the final third. His off the ball positioning is great as he's always shifting and making off the ball runs. Willian's okay at it, but I highly doubt he's scoring that Burnley goal or City goal. Schurrle also is a much better passer simply because he's average at passing. Some of Willian's final passes are just bad. Either straight into a defender or behind the recipient. Same concept applies to shooting as Schurrle's a pretty decent finisher for a winger while Willian is below average and inconsistent.

Don't take this personally, but the idea that Willian is free from constructive criticism because he runs a lot is silly to me. You can't have all flashy and flair players but we don't have that much. We have Hazard, Oscar and Fabregas. We do have Costa and Hazard to do the finishing, but often they don't get in those positions partly due to Willian's poor final pass.

But as for the quality this season vs the 9/10 era, I'd say the show did have a bad season, but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be.

Out of 12 episodes of this year's run, I would say that 4 were genuinely bad: Deep Breath, Into the Dalek, Robot of Sherwood, and Kill the Moon.

3 were good: Time Heist, Mummy on the Orient Express, and Flatline.

And the remaining 4 (counting the finale as 1 episode) were about average.

The thing that people need to remember though is that quality has always been inconsistent.

Just look at the 2006 season, David Tennant's first. That season had 3 major stinker episodes: The Idiot's Lantern, Love and Monsters, and Fear Her.

It also had some truly amazing episodes like The Girl in the Fireplace, The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit, and Army of Ghosts/Doomsday. And the rest were about average.

So again we get a rough three way split between good, bad, and average.

There was probably less grumbling about it at the time because 1) The show had a lot less watchers back then and 2) Tennant is more fun than Capaldi.

Since then, we've had an exponential growth in the number of people watching the show, especially under Matt Smiths time, and some really amazing seasons like 2010 (which I'd be hard pressed to pick a single truly bad episode out of) that have spoiled us.

Capaldi is playing a very different doctor, which is fine but it does turn some people off. And he had the back luck to come in on a bad season.

If the Christmas special is any indication though it looks like he might be warming up just a little bit, which I think will help.

1. Unlike other methods used to control the fox population (which - like the deer population - has no natural predators in the UK as wolves are locally extinct) it brings back in natural selection. Fox hunting primarily kills the old, ill and lame foxes, keeping the population healthy.

2.

There are worries that our current growth however was just the output gap - because demand has been so absent we've actually just been under utilising our economic capacity, and so the growth is just 'return to the norm' whereas France never had that same hurdle (because their government pushed up demand with spending, a potentially inflationary policy).

So the question then is in the next 5 years, where does the UK economy continue it's growth if not simply recovering lost output.

To put it in perspective, total change since the recession started for the UK is about +2.5%, France is +1.8% - so there's not really a huge amount of difference considering the French economy was larger to begin with.",0,1419622307,null,0,false,0,cn5yg3h,t3_2qfpau,t1_cn5yg3h,t1_cn5ow2h,null,1425207046,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Would you mind pointing out (even roughly) when this was? I will call a spade a spade, but I am not about dressing people down for an opinion if they can back it up. I would like to try and find the comment though so i know better next time. 

Yes, I am strong in my opinions, but I am not uncompromising. I will take in good arguments if people make them, and have changed views plenty of times after conversations with people on here. 

&gt; You questioned that person's football knowledge

When did I do that? I was pretty clear in saying I was doing the exact opposite. Yes, I said that some people don't know the rules, but to me that isn't calling someone out and saying they don't know about it. Even the person I was responding to said that they misread my comment and it actually doesn't imply what you said, and they didn't see it as me correcting them. 

&gt;You made a broad generalization about him over a minor wording error. We all knew what he meant by ""last man"" but you're the only one who decided to pick on him about it instead of just letting it go.

Actually, I completely disagree here. I made a throwaway comment correcting the rules, and then got called out and was put in a position where I feel I was forced to defend myself. As I say, it is like people correcting alot- common misconceptions should be corrected. Yea, you can let them go, but then we don't learn- which is what most people come here to do. 

&gt;We all knew what he meant by ""last man""

Case and point is Steven Gerrard; he gave an fairly open interview when he was younger and first coming onto the scene which was then contorted and used to spin an agenda driven narrative to sell newspapers. Since then he has given nothing to the media beyond turgid football cliches and PR bullshit, as he should. Wouldn't you, if you knew that ""We have been very poor recently and we're relatively low on confidence at the moment as a result, but we know things are going to improve"" can become ""Gerrard admits that Liverpool are a club that is devoid of confidence and hope"". And if anyone thinks this is an exaggeration of (parts of) the disgraceful, ruthless English media, then they're closing their eyes.. In reality it can be much worse. 

Remember, football media is a massively profitable industry too, and they'll often spin any narrative they like to sell copies/attract website visitors.

&gt;aggressive passers ***of the lot***

I really don't have the patience for you AND spursfan101 today. 

Bentaleb isn't a particularly aggressive passer, but compared to Dembele and Stambouli and Capoue and Paulinho he might as well be fucking Xabi Alonso. 

3 of our central midfielders complete more than 1 pass over 20 yards per match. Mason, Bentaleb, and Capoue. Capoue because he likes to switch the play a lot. Bentaleb attempts more balls in behind than any of them, and likes to play it forward quickly far more than Dembele or Stambouli. 

I generally like how Capoue uses the ball as well, but sometimes he's almost like Huddlestone in how much he slows us down. 

I don't think there's a good answer to our central midfield problem because all of the players are mediocre and flawed.

I can however pretty much guarantee that if we play Capoue and Dembele we'll be sturdier defensively but the posts whining about how easily we're carved apart will be replaced by posts whining about an inability to link midfield and attack. 

Everyone is sort of taking for granted how nicely we pop it through midfield when we play with Bentaleb and Mason. Most of our sweeping one touch moves during the last few months have been facilitated by those midfielders because of how quickly they read the game compared to some of our other options. 

I'm not saying they should be the partnership going forward, but I think dropping both of them will create new problems. It's certainly a valid discussion to have, but I think this entire thread is pretty kneejerk.

I don't expect, and wouldn't want, them to keep him the same as he always was. In fact, my biggest complaint about Matt Smith early on was that he felt like he was trying a little too hard to be David Tennant. But after a few episodes he found his own thing and became a great Doctor in his own right.

Capaldi feels like he's still trying to find that. His doctor is very cold and unable to filter his anger. Through most of the season I felt like that aspect of his personality overwhelmed his character. It seems like in the last few episodes though he's warmed up a little bit.

On Boxing day the last 3 years, this was the points tally for teams which were 4th.

2013-14 : 36 points.

2012-13 : 33 points

2011 - 12 : 34


In 2011-12 and 12-13 the team which actually finished 4th had 33 and 32 point respectively on Boxing day.


This year 2014-15  the  4th team is on 32 points.  


While I am a optimist , i would not bet on either West Ham or Southampton finishing in top 4. This means  the team most likely to finish 4th ( Arsenal , Spurs ) are right now  on 30 points. The lowest ever in the last 3/4 seasons. 


We have a 4 point gap which is not very bad.. 

We are only looking at being more consistent than Arsenal and Spurs and maybe play well in the big games against them. 

Its achievable .. if ( and its a big if )we play well and click as a team ...


 having said that .. the way we are playing we should also  look at the downward spiral statistics  i.e. teams which were near top 4 on Boxing day and ended up finishing in bottom ten because a run of bad games could easily push us into the downward spiral.

In your mind, it does. Idem for the following sentence after that one. Nor is it quite clear where exactly you're hearing this message from, because I don't.

&gt; What I'm saying is that the aims of profit are in contradiction to the aims of a healthy society.

Maybe. And even if they are, it doesn't follow from that that they *have to be* necessarily.

&gt; Obesity and bad decisions have a knock-on bad effect on the country as a whole.

Sure, if enough people are like that. 

&gt; It puts more strain on the NHS for example.

Only because it is allowed to.

&gt;  It is in the interests of business to encourage people not to reduce consumption, but to consume as much as possible.

In a financial sense, sure.

&gt;  Therefore, it is not all down to personal responsibility.

Your conclusion is a non-sequitur. There's no possible way in which the rest of your post can be considered to be premises in support of that conclusion, unless I'm going to be so charitable as to make the whole argument for you.

Yes, there are genetic as well as environmental factors which influence behaviour. But that doesn't mean the individual does not hold most of the responsibility for their choices. After all, it's entirely possible to believe in determinism and still hold people responsible. And yes, a business wants to sell as much as it can. But that doesn't mean its goal of selling their stock *compels* you to buy and consume.

Let's say you're a smoker and that you started because you wanted to be cool. Let's say you started because every other friend of yours was a smoker too. And let's say you just risked being ostracized if you didn't. Even if all those conditions hold and 100 others, it's still hard to see how you are not to be the one primarily held responsible for your starting to smoke. What meaning could the word possible having if in this instance it's not *you* who are primarily responsible, but everything else that influenced your decision?

Lastly, because a philosophical discussion is going a bit far at this point in the conversation, let's return to something more practical: Even if a person bears no responsibility at all for their life choices (yeah..) it would *still* be more useful to think otherwise.

It is funny that you brought in evidence that proves my point, yet say I have no evidence. And you simply dismiss what I am saying. To reiterate, Rodger has displayed a pattern of poor managerial decisions concerning personnel. Whether it be  dropping players for dubious reason such as Agger, Sakho, and Migs.

He likes to think of himself as a box to box, but I see him currently as a defensive disruptor (more Matic, less Yaya). Amalfitano is weak on defense but his link up play is very good, and he's already shown the ability to get goals. I think we would do well with a 4-2-2-2 with Downing and Amalfitano pushed above Song and Kouyate (or Noble). However, if we are playing someone like Chelsea or City, I'd certainly consider pulling Amalfitano for Noble so we have 3 mids who can defend well.

During these hard times I doubt Rodgers wants to lose Gerrard's support by benching him. Moreover, he could lose Gerrard over the summer as well. Thus, I doubt Rodgers is fully to blame for how much Gerrad is playing. 

You can say Rodgers should be strong and put his foot down, but he hasn't cemented his place at this club. If he loses Gerrard, everyone else Gerrard influences will follow. It's a delicate situation and I really hate it when people put all the blame on Rodgers for this situation.

Another one was ""I don't shop because I need things"" (shown with a picture of a glamorous, grinning young woman, laden down with shopping bags). It's quite clear what these messages mean. 

I didn't say that our system involves compulsion. People are responsible for their individual actions; nevertheless, if society is set up as it is at present, unhealthy lifestyles will simply be *more likely*. Just as when someone commits a crime, he is entirely responsible for his actions, nevertheless, the way in which society is currently set up will lead to crime being more likely, which is not to say that they will occur ineluctably. The influence is rather more subtle than that.

To not see human choices as individual *and at the same time* social is to close your eyes to one whole half of what it is to be human. 

And you have not at all addressed my main point, which is the contradiction between the two principles advocated by society; what's healthy for business (consume as much as possible), and what's healthy for the individual and the environment (reduce consumption). Societies that send out contradictory messages like that are themselves unhealthy.

Hunts riding out were never guaranteed to pick up a fox, and even if they did get a scent, a kill was also never guaranteed.

In those cases where they got a kill, in many cases it is quick, with the leading dog jumping at the throat and breaking it's neck. In some cases the death is more protracted (although no worse than a fox killing a lamb or chicken).

In 2014 it's not an especially efficient method, but the actual threat to animal welfare is relatively low.

I know an Oxfordshire based vet who refuses to have any dealings with the RSPCA after they refused to act on evidence he had of illegal hare coursing (photos and video - easy slam-dunk case). Said they didn't have the resource to take it to court. Two months later they spent £326k bringing relatively minor charges against the Heythrop Hunt.

It's not hugely efficient as a form of pest control, it's also not really doing much harm either, so why ban it? To appease the sensibilities of a few city dwellers who have never seen a hunt firsthand and who are completely unaffected by it?

&gt;__Christmas crackers__—also known as __bon-bons__—are part of [Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) celebrations primarily in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland) and [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) countries such as [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) and [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa). A cracker consists of a [cardboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboard) tube wrapped in a brightly decorated twist of paper,  making it resemble an oversized [sweet-wrapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy#Packaging). The cracker is pulled by two people, often with arms crossed, and, much in the manner of a [wishbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furcula), the cracker splits unevenly.  The split is accompanied by a mild bang or snapping sound produced by the effect of friction on a [shock-sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_sensitivity), chemically-impregnated card strip (similar to that used in a [cap gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_gun)).  One chemical used for the friction strip is [silver fulminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_fulminate),  which is highly unstable.

No doubt. And as I've already said, it's more useful to keep people responsible for their choices than to provide something that can be used as an excuse (i.e. diffusing responsibility). Yet I only see you talking about one of them. Indeed, wouldn't it in that case be *more* useful to **not** mention the ways in which people aren't so much responsible for their choices while seeking to minimize the ways in which they fall victim to their own weak wills?

I think that the definition of ""country dweller"" is not terribly useful. There's a world of difference between someone raised in Chipping Norton and someone actually raised on a small farm in the Valleys.

I know a number of people who ""were raised in the country"" who oppose fox hunting. But as far as I'm concerned they're not entitled to an opinion on the matter (especially since one of them told be how ""cruel"" drag hunting was FFS) because they may have been raised in a village not a town, but they don't actually know anything about farming or land management. They have as much right to an opinion on the topic as I have to opine on the best way of making a latte, what with my total lack of experience as a barista.

Well, I guess we all have a right to an opinion, but given the value of those opinions (zilch) they shouldn't exactly be courted by policy makers!


As someone from a afarming background, there are welfare concerns. But I don't see them as sufficient to justify a ban, much less the *hundreds* of hours of Parliamentary Debating time that Labour's class-warfare campaign ended up consuming, at a cost of millions of pounds to taxpayers.

One can argue that if it's such a minor matter then should the government spend any further time repealing it. I have a lot of sympathy with that position.

Your point about the conflicting messages completely misses the mark because it is not a single actor broadcasting those messages. You act like the merchant that wants his products to be bought is also the one that's harping on about reducing consumption. That is quite clearly false. Secondly, nowhere is the message as explicit as you make it nor as clearly detrimental as you believe. Even if the goal is to maximize consumption there could still be a further clause that states maximize consumption up to the point that it doesn't adversely impact your health.

All in all, you're mostly making up strawmen and arguing against them. Also, you're missing out important nuances of the issue. There's only so much society can do to help people control their appetite without it devolving into a dictatorship. Freedom inherently has risks. Should people's lives be dictated to them because they are weak-willed? Nor do I hear of something specific that you would propose as a solution. Harping on about perceived societal ills does very little when it's not followed up with something more concrete.

We were left with this massive gap all game between Sterling and the rest of the team as most of our midfield had to drop deeper to try and get the ball from a pressured defence with no time to look up, which just makes our half even more congested and difficult to try and play out of.

2. It is unfair to expect us to improve on last years results in coming second. A number of factors are decisive here, we havnt had sturridges goals. The lack of European football etc.

3. If you're expecting year on year improvements you should try supporting Chelsea or Man City they will have the financial resources to sustain your expectations.

In most places in the UK, not owning a car is a viable (if irritating) option. It might suck pretty solidly, getting up at the crack of dawn to cycle, or packing yourself on to a bus filled with rowdy 11 year olds, but at least it reaches the minimum level of practicability for most of us.

For much of the US, public transport simply isn't an option, either due to the distances involved, or the fact that there just aren't any buses in Scrotum, Iowa (population 312).

That means everyone who has to travel to get to work (i.e. everyone outside a population centre) needs a car. That includes everyone earning federal minimum wage - which, in case we're not all aware, stacks up to the equivalent of a princely £4.66 per hour.

Is there any situation in which we would recommend someone earning £9,700 per year to buy a car? Yet that is what a good proportion of the 3.3 million people in the US who earn minimum wage or less will end up having to do.

false,rantipoler,newcr-10,Nuno Valente's hair wax,"Our problem, it seems to me, is that we're scared of giving the ball away.

The point of a slow build up is to drag the opposition slightly out of position, create space between a full back and centre back and then overload that space - but this has to be done very quickly and usually takes a risky run and pass. 

Today, it worked a few times positionally - all with Baines as the man making the run. I'll have to watch Match of the Day to confirm, but I think Mirallas was the static winger who gave their full back the problem. One of these was the free kick that should have been a red card for Walters. There were a few instances where we could have attempted the pass to Baines or Mirallas in these situations - but it never came, and this is our problem. We don't do the important part of our philosophy. 

There was a criticism of Barcelona a while back that they just passed the ball for passing's sake - they didn't. Every pass had a purpose. There are two reasons to pass the ball: to keep possession or to improve your position. The first is for when you're winning and the second is for when you're losing or drawing.

 (For new fans, by ""improve your position"", I mean thatafter each pass, you should be more likely to score in this move than you were before you received the ball)

This is what Barcelona did extremely well. They constantly created small pockets of space just to the left and right of the D. Then, after the overload, they would play 3-4 first time passes and have a man one on one with the keeper.

We do this and instead of using the pocket, a man gets it and passes it back to the defence.

We have no confidence in our style of play.

However the troubles are still recent in people's memories across the UK and it is near impossible to learn about the troubles without ultimately learning about Ireland's history with the UK to understand the context of them.

I think that what happened in Ireland is unremarkable compared to what the UK and all other colonial powers were engaging in overseas at the time, but inherently worse because Ireland wasn't a colony of Britain, it was part of it. It was the British state treading on its own people. However if you look through British history, damn near every part of the country was abused by the powerful elite (such as here in Wales where the Welsh language was also forced out of use ). These generally go forgotten by the population; the history of Ireland doesn't because it culminated in a victory for the downtrodden population giving them freedom to enshrine it in history for evermore.

I don't hold any strong emotional opinion either way on the history of Ireland. They aren't good or bad events, they are just events that took place in order to shape the present. Had they not happened then the world as we know it would be a very different place, either for the better or worse. Nor do I think there is any reason for people alive today to feel guilty or angry about them; the vast majority of people alive today in the UK have done nothing to harm Ireland because all of it has had home rule since before we were born. Nor are there very many people alive in the Republic of Ireland today who have been impacted by the events of British rule over Ireland (I say Republic of Ireland because I fear including NI in that statement will open a can of worms).

false,GoldenSpurs,num23,,"It's not that are our midfielders are ""single skilled,"" it's that we keep trying to shove players in a position where they don't fit. Dembele is not and will not ever be a DM. We've seen how playing him there are changed his career trajectory. Same for Bentaleb. He used to be a player that would make runs and find himself on the edge of the box attempting long shots or making dangerous passes - similar to Mason. Mason will probably be the next for this to happen to.

Capoue and Stamboli can't be relied on to create too much for us and that isn't their fault. We knew what kind of players they were when we bought them and if we get a player to complement them, they will be fine. I think Mason can play well beside one of the two, but again thats not his strength and it may ruin him.

Schneiderlin would have been great for us, but I think that ship has sailed. I haven't seen much of Rabiot but he did look like that player that could start from deep and work his way up field playing quick passes and make his way forward. I wanted Verriatti or Strootman a few years ago, ships sailed...blah blah...

So yeah, I agree that we need another midfielder, but to discount players like Dembele, Mason and Bentaleb is wrong. Players like Schneiderlin, Fabregas and Modric don't just pop out of nowhere. It will take serious scouting or great player development to get them. Until then we have the players we do. Who do you suggest we sign?

false,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"This is a good example of what I was describing above when I talked about star wars level morality. The depiction of an evil and cruel British political elite callously and cruelly organising the death of millions of people needlessly is a fundamentally flawed historiographical interpretation of exceptionally complicated motives and justifications for actions.

The British political elite didn't wake up one morning and think that without some genocide their day planner looked a bit empty. The Irish potato famine was the culmulation of centuries of Anglo-Irish conflicts with mulitple strategic, historical and economic interpretations melded with very specific and developing and untested economic theories which made the question of intervention in the matter one which was, using the knowledge of the time, highly debateable. Actions and lack of actionswere informed by these variables. 

Yes, there were many who believed that it would be a good thing if the population of Ireland was greatly reduced. They took this view because lots of them genuinely believed that a Catholic and rebellious Ireland would be a massive threat to Britain and could eventually result in the forced return of Britain to Catholicism and ethnic cleansing of the Protestants in a similar manner to 1641 (mostly due to false history of the time). They looked at all of the times that Ireland had proven a strategic liability in war with France, Scotland and other european powers and were genuinely afraid of Ireland being used as a staging post for an invasion of Britain. Remember, the tudor conquest of Ireland was driven by an Irish rebellion to put a pretender on the English throne. If your aim is to solve the threat of ireland, non-intervention was the way forwards. 

But these individuals were in an extreme minority when it came to the commons. I'm sure you can come up with a number of sources, but these are never anywhere near to the majority of the commons.

The majority of people advocated taking no action because they were whigs who strongly believed in laissez-faire economics. This was a century before Keynes and the overwhelming majority of informed economists were suggesting that taking action in the market was a bad thing. They were wrong in this situation, but not because they had just randomly made up economic theories.

In addition, remember they had imperfect knowledge of the situation in Ireland. Many believed that the responsibility for maintaining the welfare with the poor lay with irish landowners or the irish church. I don't have the time or inclination to explain the multitude of their sins, but they don't exactly come out of it well.

Note I am not defending their actions. They were idealistic ideologues implimenting bad policy and their negligance caused millions of needless deaths. But they were not commiting genocide because they hated Irish people and wanted to steal their food. They were exporting food because by selling food they would get money which they could exchange for goods and services which were needed.

It is a really complicated situation with lots of bad actors with a lot of bad history and a lot of different motivations and driving forces.

&gt; I have a feeling Rodgers will play Lovren unfortunately. I say this because leaving £20m on the bench seems a bit embarrassing for Rodgers and the committee (hence why Agger was frozen out for Sakho). I'd play Kolo every day of the week, but we know how stubborn Rodgers can be. The silver lining in this hypothetical situation is that Lovren has something to prove, his place is not guaranteed. He simply has to play his heart out against Chelsea.

I've just had a cursory 2-minute scroll through your submission history. Interesting reading to say the least. Not the parts about you being Indian and supporting Man Utd. That was just too obvious. You haven't appeared to have submitted anything condemning the sexual abuse, only you have submitted many links to articles condemning the reaction to it. Which is something. I guess some angry people tweeting hate crimes about Islam and mosques is somewhat comparable to 17-year-long underaged rape of 1400 white girls perpetuated by the South Asian/Islamic community.

Ah, said with the unerring certainty of the ignorant. 

The obesity epidemic is entirely driven by the obesogenic environment we live in, overlaid upon the inherent, evolved, biological predisposition to put weight on.  That's why it's gotten worse in the last 40 years despite the populace being biologically nearly identical (bar epigenetic priming of metabolism and appetite, but thats a complex story).  

It is emphatically NOT a condition of lack of personal responsibility and as a researcher into the biochemistry of obesity and predisposing mechanisms I'll argue that view with anyone.

PCOS as a condition is associated with often quite severe dysfunction of key endocrine systems which influence metabolism and appetite.  See, for example, [this paper](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jc.2003-031583).

Honestly. Some guy before the Arsenal game asked us fans in here how we think the season will go. I said (while still under Pulis) it will be a relegation dogfight. They appointed the wrong guy. When it was out of him and Clarke. It should have been Clarke. 


Warnock is an embarrassment and needs to go after the QPR game whether he wins, draws or loses. This can't go on. When Pulis was sacked, he was briefly rumoured as an outsider to come back. I stand by my support for this impossibility happening. 


Today, 4-3-3. We had no width and he didnt change it until 2 or 3-0 down. He then swaps to a 4-4-2. Takes ""striker"" Bolasie off for right back Kelly to play right midfield. Surely Bannan can play better at right wing than Kelly? (And I hate Bannan.)


I said after the great Liverpool win, that this doesn't validate Warnock. 


I am glad I stayed to the end today. The silent protest of the fanatics spoke volumes. The last time I saw them do that, Holloway resigned. Warnock has to go. 


Oh and the fans were shit today. The worst I have ever seen. I don't mean when the fanatics got to 3-0 and did their silence. I mean everything before that.

You derive pleasure from hurting and eventually killing a fox. That fits my definition of sadism.

I'm not saying that you have to stay up all night watching with a rifle. I'm saying that 12 people on horses with dogs is not an efficient way to control fox populations.

false,TheMauryShiow,crest-new,,"Has anyone thought at all this season: ""maybe we should change up the tactics/formation?""

I sure have. I don't see why we should stick to the same 4-2-3-1 that we have all season and last season. We need to put pressure on the back lines of other teams, and there are two main ways to do that: 

1. have a striker run around all day and tire them out.
2. Send in a bunch of crosses (Moyes wet dream).

Since we can't cross the ball to save our lives, that leaves us with option 1. Rom makes good runs and is very physical, but doesn't exactly make the defense chase him to tire them out. I think a 4-1-2-1-2 that would look something like this:

                            Howard/Robles
                      Coleman Jags Stones Baines
                               McCarthy
                        Naismith      Mirallas
                               Barkley
                        Lukaku     Eto'o/Kone

This gives Barkley the freedom to pass to more strikers and Mirallas and Naismith can still make their runs on the wing. Yes there are drawbacks to this system, like Mirallas and Naismith aren't the best defenders and our depth sucks, but we have to do something up front and can't leave Lukaku alone up top. He's physical, we need a striker with pace that he can play the ball to or can attract defenders to open him up for good shots.

I had high hopes he'd find his feet in the Championship, but I have never been convinced that he offers anything more than being a decent late-game impact sub, when his pace really comes in handy. Other than that, his technique is pretty predictable, his passing/crossing is suspect and his attempts on goal pretty much end up in orbit. After all this time there's still no end product. Maybe he isn't getting the appropriate coaching, but I'm more inclined to believe he's just one more limited player on the squad.

If not, you can still get the commuter card, which I believe as of 1st Jan 2015 is called the ALink card and it's about 30% off your train fare but you need to sort that out with your employer.

ie: I pay may company the sum of ~£1000 a year and they pay that to Translink and that means that £90 odd comes out of my pay per month. I don't have to worry about any ticket whatsoever (you also get free transport during the weekend).

So basically:

If you are less than 24, use a YLink card.

Amazingly, the manager listened, the owners supported him and we had a blinder in the transfer market.

Now to today. Nolan's our ""Baliotelli""; he just doesn't fit in to BFS new style. BFS has gone and got himself a new sharp suit and Nolan's still in his trackies following him round.

There were several instances where Can stepped up to pressure a ball in the air leaving our defense exposed with lots of room for forwards to run into. One specific instance was a ball played 10 yards outside our box. Lucas was already on the Burnley players back (Don't remember which one) to challenge the ball. However, can who was standing at the top of the 18 along with our other 2 CBs. As the ball came in Can came rushing in and knocked into Lucas, this allowed Burnley with an opportunity to flick the ball on with the whole left side of our defense open since Henderson was positioned further up field. Again this happened a couple more times as I remember.

I do not blame Can for this as he was playing out of position and has never played CB as far as I know (although he has played as a (LB). The way he played today and his aggressiveness makes him look very promising as a DM that would sit in front of our 2 CBs and I'm hoping he will get more opportunities to play there in the future.

&gt;__River Song__ is a [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character) played by [Alex Kingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kingston) in the British [science-fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. River Song was introduced to the series as an experienced future [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)) of series protagonist the [Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)), an alien [Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) who [travels through time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel_in_fiction) in his [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS). Because River Song is a time traveller herself, her adventures with the Doctor occur out of synchronisation; their first meeting (from the audience's perspective) is his first and apparently her last. In later appearances, River is a companion, romantic interest and eventual wife of the Doctor in his [eleventh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Doctor) incarnation, portrayed by [Matt Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith_(actor\)). River Song was created by *Doctor Who* writer [Steven Moffat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat) for the show's [fourth series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_4\)) in 2008, under the tenure of [executive producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer) [Russell T Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies). When Moffat took over Davies' duties as executive producer, he began expanding on the character's background, depicting adventures earlier in River's timeline, upgrading Alex Kingston from a guest star to a [recurring actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurring_character) in the series. Other actresses have subsequently portrayed younger versions of the character.

Bentaleb didn't shine and maybe he is exhausted, so I'm going to wash this one. Same with Stambouli and Mason. They just didn't seem to get into a groove. 

I disagree with your account of Rose and our Vert/Fazio pairing. 

First, rose. He didn't play well but I don't think he has straight up lost his spot. To me, he looks like his instructions changed today and he pushed higher up and stood down to their wingers. Granted, Chadli didn't support the way I expected to see him to and I think it's common knowledge Rose needs that support. He is leaps and bounds better than last years play so I'm not sure where you think he has disappointed us. A bad game is a bad game is a bad game. Even Diego Costa has them. 

Maybe we watched a different game but the vert/Fazio pairing looked very shaky. They never looked synced to me. Often out of line with each other, crossing into the others space, and failing to pick up a runner coming through their channels. What I didn't particularly like is that when Leicester starting building pressure, neither one looked like they sorted out the back line and created a defensive structure. The backbone often looked jagged and lost. When your backline can't structure your defensive cohesion, you're gonna have a bad time. Hence, Leicester were unlucky to not to be drawing us.  

You say that they did well given the lack of protection but when you look at world class centre backs, they are screaming at players if they aren't forming the defensive structure they are supposed to. Yes, Bentaleb and Stam didn't get their shit sorted but Jan and Fazio need to be hollering at them every damn minute. 

That said, poch could have turned up to them and told them to stand off and drop deep, but that seems to against our high pressure system. ",0,1419652442,null,0,false,0,cn6ax5a,t3_2qhtsp,t1_cn6ax5a,t3_2qhtsp,null,1425201118,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

I have a friend in Finaghy who starts at 9.30 leaves a 8.30 and he it takes him 45 mins to get in. Parking in Belfast is something the council need to look at. My only suggestion is to go for one of the open air car parks a touch outside the city. £3.60 a day. Alternatively the odyssey does a deal for around £16 a week, a good few in my office use it, but with parking its just about getting it cheap as possible.
- Train from Lisburn station (reasonably priced with YLink, ~2.5 mile cycle or potentially park and ride?: Yep. The train is the best but expensive. Anything you can do to make it cheaper will help. Also the express trains from Lisburn will cut a massive chunk off you commute.
- Or a bus from Sprucefield park and ride (close but no WiFi and seems expensive). [**Bonus**: Translink timetable claims they can get to Europa Bus Center in 20 minutes during rush hour..?): This bus will use the bus lanes on the motorway, but if you have the option always go for the train. There are a lot of complaints re TransLink, but after a solid ten years of travelling into Belfast it def is the best option if the two.

false,MGharibian,newcr-6,"suffering at the hands of Martinez' evil twin, Fartinez","I'm going to copy and paste my comment from the post-match thread here because I made that one too late for anybody to see it and it's actually really relevant to this:

As you all know I'm usually very vocal in the post-match conversation, but this time I was so upset I decided to take a breather before thinking about it and now, 5 hours later, I'm still fucking furious.

People seem to be arguing alot about this but I honestly feel like the heart has largely gone out of our game. Most of the players don't seem to care, and the ones that do are starting to care less and less as they get demoralized. Where was naisy for large parts of todays game? He hasn't disappeared like that in a while. And hesitating on that chance in the box, I mean come on.

And that chance with ross where he didn't even jump to touch the cross was just disgraceful. If ross and naisy aren't showing heart then what the fuck is going on? Seriously.

Also, while we're on the subject of heart, where the fuck has seamus been all season? Last season he was giving his all out there all the time, he hasn't had any tangible effect on any game all season. Even the commentators hit on it today, exactly what I was saying last time. Noone is hungry, everyone just wants to pass it around but noone wants to move forward or take a chance at goal.

Also fuck stoke for playing like dirty cunts like usual and injuring half our team. Especially fuck charlie fucking adam, just an awful person. Did you see how he was standing over the obviously injured mirallas calling him a cunt with that sneer on his face? Dude is a villain.

In other news, honestly again what the fuck with the sub bobby. WE DON'T NEED A NEW 10 WHEN WE'RE DOWN 0-1 LATE IN THE GAME. We can pass it around and make plays fine, it's that noone wants to finish, noones hungry, and ESPECIALLY not Eto'o. Kone, however, seemed to be when he came in. So ridiculous to not sub in a new forward when we can't even get a shot on target. It's like Bobby feels bad about spending so much money on Lukaku when he's not doing anything so he just doesn't want to sub him out.

Only positives were that McCarthy looked decent, and Stones actually did his job. It wasn't even that he was super good. He just simply actually served a purpose instead of just being a body in the way.
Today after watching the highlights I realized that leicester fans are better off than us right now. We're both losing every game but at least they're fucking putting everything out there every game. At least a majority of that team comes out and cares every game. This is just fucking sad. But srsly we should get schmeichel for next season

Lastly with regard to Newcastle, I didn't see their game against united but I saw them against Sunderland and they looked fucking hungry, which is as I have said exactly the thing we're missing. I know that was the Tyne-Wear derby and all, but they honestly looked twice as hungry as we did against liverpool. So I was optimistic and said we would probably get a draw with stoke and I'll be optimistic again and say we'll probably draw with newcastle, but of course that doesn't affect my love of everton. COYB always, it's just when you care about something seeing it fuck itself up is all the more personal and frustrating ",0,1419654049,null,0,false,0,cn6bkg0,t3_2qhng0,t1_cn6bkg0,t3_2qhng0,null,1425200818,8,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,8

There were so many opportunities for terror, but bad writing and direction missed them. Dream crabs that you have to try not to think about? That slowly dissolve your brain? Scary stuff, or at least it should have been.

When the Doctor was explaining to everyone that they were still in the dream at the north pole, they missed the opportunity to have the 4 patients on the screen behind him get up, walk toward the camera and start coming through the screen while he was talking. The way they did it missed the terror of it.

Also, the ending could have been so much more powerful. Last minute, Clara decides to stay on the sleigh with Santa, pan out, and Santa has turned into Mr. Pink in his Santa outfit. Doctor gets to her house, finds she's grown old, turns out she wanted to spend what remaining time she had left with Danny, who she never found a replacement for.

I mean, seriously, Jenna Coleman has had enough seasons, time to write her off. But even if you want to make it a fake out, you could have at least gone with the idea that part of her just didn't want to live anymore without Danny.

BTW...what happened to the fact that in the real world everyone is supposed to have a hole in their skull and an exposed brain? Also, the fact that we're hiding from the obvious dark drama that people could wake up with partial brain damage, memories missing, mentally disfigured...is this a kids show? I know it's a Christmas episode, but the drama and emotionality of it practically writes itself.

She changed her mind about the Doctor several times during Series 8; going from hating him to loving him to whatever else. At the start of Mummy on the Orient Express she was ready to stop traveling with him, and by the end - even after he used her to trick a woman to what would have been her death - she was willing to lie to both Danny and the Doctor just to travel in the TARDIS.

Then she and the Doctor finally went their separate ways at the end of Death in Heaven after Danny died (twice), for the best. Then of course she's fucking back for Series 9 because she just can't stay away holy shit Moffat stop.

Rory. The Doctor never cared about him and never seemed particularly affected by what happened to him. Indeed, the Doctor usually does ""worship"" his companions to an extent. But that doesn't invalidate my point.

It was an extremely tough, and cruel call to have to make, but she made the right one. And what's wrong with being empathetic to aliens?

That was the evolution of the Doctor and Clara's relationship. A big theme of this season was that the Doctor isn't sweet little Eleven anymore. He can be unkind and unpredictable, and it was something Clara didn't understand at first. The conflict they had in Deep Breath didn't end with that episode, the whole season became Clara slowly realizing that the Doctor is the still her friend. She leaves so many times because she thinks he's changed for the worse, but she returns because she realizes he's really the same person who befriended her. By the end of the series she's accepted fully that he's the same man and that's why she was willing to lie to stay with him. 

I can't really change your opinion if you liked the end of Death in Heaven, but personally I feel like that would have been a horrible way to end it. After finally seeing that the Doctor is still her friend to just then leave in a lie? Its like the whole series was just a waste! And Clara has been described many times as not quite fitting in the world she lives in, so it would be so sad to think such an incredible person would just be stuck in an ordinary life she didn't choose. I think series 8 was an adjustment series, but now the Doctor and Clara are ready to face everything head on in series 9.
