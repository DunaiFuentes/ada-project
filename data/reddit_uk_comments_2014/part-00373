And no, it's nowhere near the capacity of the Hinkley C plant, but that's one of the main advantages of nuclear power.

I wasn't referring to the Severn Barrage but to a smaller project in Swansea Bay. The BBC had numbers on the total costs of a set of similar potential projects but (unless I'm reading the wrong article) they've removed them.

I don't have a problem with nuclear power, I have a problem with how poorly the UK is implementing it.

On the other hand, failing to properly cover for Sturridge is one mistake.

An item that doesn't give stats on an illusion hero sounds really dirty to me... his whole power (ramping up a bagazillion illus) is weakened by not stacking stats... 

I personally go 

Lane:

tango

salve

ring of protection
 
any mix of branches and clarities (I usually go full branches though) 

this lets you get an early basi... though I usually get em after brown boots... always consider magic stick in lane, if they are harassing you with abilities stick -&gt; basi regen imo. 

I also max his pseudo blink first to reduce the cooldown to like 10 seconds or something (his second ability)... the disruption time is amazing for dodging a lot of skills and using it to jump over walls, you can use the guaranteed illus to tank jungle and the mini blink to destroy trees and just get around the jungle faster for farming.  

He doesn't play too different imo ... except you gotta always have a spare tp on you. 

order of items for me is usually treads -&gt; (yasha == diffusal)* -&gt; manta** -&gt; skadi*** If you're still thinking about items after this... I don't know what game you're in :P ... stack skadi all day errday.

this is pretty much every game for me... 


*Yasha or Diffusal:
If you are going to be farming a lot or you trash your lane and get like 2 or 3 kills you can pick up yasha first. Yasha really speeds up your farm thanks to the damage and move speed, and you'll be turning it into manta so it's not a wasted space.  If your other lanes are getting wrecked and you need to fight early then rushing diffusal is pretty much needed... you don't have damage if your illus don't have damage (feedback is amazing). 


**Upgrade diffusal before manta:
700 gold for 15 agility...... It's a lot stronger than you think... that's another 15 damage per hit per illusion... and attackspeed with feedback is good :) 


***Skadi and Diffusal (yes, I know they don't stack):
Here is the trick... your illusions load up your items in order (top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right) And the first UAM in your inventory is the one you use. 

Using these two facts we can have main pl apply skadi slow while illusions hit with feedback damage (main pl doesn't really care about feedback once you have skadi) 

once you have both these items... just make sure diffusal is earlier in the load order than skadi (I have the bottom row as diffusal, skadi, manta)... but drop diffusal and pick it up to make sure main pl uses slow rather than feedback. 

I've yet to come across a game where I've had to deviate from this... but again I'm 2k shit tier... so ... fuck knows. ",0,1418235816,null,0,1418236576,0,cmqz6o7,t3_2ouoo8,t1_cmqz6o7,t3_2ouoo8,null,1425501398,2,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,2

Negatives

* subpar first touch

* subpar technique when controlling the ball

* no dribbling abilty

* no hold-up play

* plays with his head down

* passing is erratic

* can only use his right foot

Positives:

* workrate

* shoots when there's a shot on

* I want to say movement without the ball, but I don't think I've seen much of that from him

So, am I being harsh to him saying that he should've taken the deal and his situation is partly his fault? It would've been better for his career, Liverpool and Sunderland would've got their man, they were ready to pay over 10m for him after all.

1. In those countries demand fell as people lacked money

2. This included demand for foreign goods and services

3. So overall demand for British goods and services fell

4. Fewer workers were needed, as less goods were being produced

5. The market wage rate falls (as less demand leads to cheaper wage prices) and there is unemployment

6. People in Britain suddenly have less money to spend on goods and services (go back to step 3)

What Labour did was to try and reverse this multiplier effect. They reduced VAT for example, to stimulate spending. It was under them that the base interest rate was reduced to 0.5%. Of course, there was going to be a budget deficit, as people were earning less so naturally, there paid less in tax. Moreover government spending contributed to demand for British goods and services, so as Keynesian economics tells us, a budget deficit was probably a good idea. Let us not forget Gordon Brown did run a budget surplus for several years as chancellor.

I actually fairly like the micro heroes... it's something I feel I'm actually not too bad at, along with my warding patterns, though sometimes I feed trying to get the ""optimal"" wards out rather than the safe ward. I could really improve my tp reactions and my itemisation... though that is something I feel like is more of a pub mentality that's easier not to do in a stack (fuck ghost sceptre/ force staff, I want aghs!). My game knowledge is much better than my mechanics (last hitting, not picnicing when I get ganked etc.)

There are far too many variables and remitting circumstances to factor in this season to judge Rodgers over such a small sample, whilst chalking up last season, and even his success at Swansea, to a ""perfect storm"". Also, it's all well and good saying that Rodgers must go but we're unlikely to be able to attract better options at the moment. If we are then it will require FSG to back the new manager like they did Rodgers so the new manager can implement *his* vision. We have to be absolutely certain if we part ways with Rodgers because he is a young, progressive, ambitious manager who, for all his faults, has showed he can manage effectively and get his teams playing expansive exciting football.  

There are other things you can do besides sack the manager to change things; I'd give him less sway on the transfer committee for a start and even look at bringing a DOF into the club though. Just because Rodgers is a good coach does not necessarily mean he has an eye for players so FSG should recognize this and implement the strategy they favoured all along. And perhaps look at getting him coaches who aren't merely ""yes men"" but instead those who challenge him to improving and building upon his philosophy.

You'd be surprised at the number of people willing to buy old crap, I've sold processors from 1997, and various PCI cards including one that added USB ports to an old desktop, LAN cards, 64MB RAM sticks, fans.
One person paid a courier to pick up 5 old PS2 keyboards from my house, sold for 1p (which I didn't make her pay)

I didn't make that much money from this but I'm glad that the people who wanted this stuff managed to get it...

&gt;__Sufism__ ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): الصوفية‎ *al-ṣūfiyya*; [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language): تصوف‎ *taṣawwuf*) is a concept in Islam, defined by scholars as the inner, [mystical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystical) dimension of Islam; others contend that it is a [perennial philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_philosophy) of existence that pre-dates religion, the expression of which flowered within the Islamic religion. Some hold the notion its essence has also been expressed via other religions and metareligious phenomena, while others believe Sufism to be totally unique within Islam.       A practitioner of this tradition is generally known as a __ṣūfī__ (/ˈsuːfi/; صُوفِيّ). They belong to different *[ṭuruq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariqah)* or ""orders""—congregations formed around a master—which meet for spiritual sessions (majalis), in meeting places known as zawiyahs, [khanqahs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanqah), or tekke.  e.g. [Khanqah Khairiyyah](http://www.khanqahkhairiyyah.com)

The list of issues with Open (and for that matter Libre) Office is absolutely huge:

 1. Third-party application integration. Microsoft have spent millions making this an absolute doddle - so much so that an enormous number of third-party applications categorically depend on Office for vital parts of their functionality.
 1. Active Directory manageability. There are first-party Group Policy templates for Microsoft Office that allow you to configure it the way you configure everything else.
 1. Corner-case functionality. Yes, Libre/Open office is just fine for 80% of boring cases, but the devil is in the details - you won't find accountants using it in a million years, they've got so many clever things going on in Excel that migrating would be a nightmare. That immediately messes up your finance department and pretty much anyone who wants to look at the reports they need.
 1. ""Free"" has negative connotations. Lots of people automatically associate ""free"" with ""and dear at the price!"" - the idea that ""free"" or ""fantastically low cost"" should be an overriding consideration shows breathtaking ignorance.

We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.

Justification: Although Kane works better as the second striker; our strongest area is across the AM 3 and we shouldn't be sacrificing them to get Soldado in the team. Kane is our best striker and in reality we're gonna be playing a one striker system for most of the season.

Which means, Thursday XI:

Chiriches-Dier-Kaboul-Rose

----Stambouli--Dembele----

Part of the problem is that people are too embarrassed to contact their MP and demand that something like face-sitting is made legal, which is one reason why any regulation of porn is always done so badly. The prudes will always be ones who influence the regulations because they are the only ones who speak up. However, I think hoping that people will get more involved is unrealistic. Instead, the conclusion I would draw is that the state should have a little to do with regulating porn as possible.

Please tell me what is either unrealistic, or ""cunty"", about wanting our own democracy/laws/legal system back, wanting a points-based immigration system (which treats everyone in the world the same way), or wanting grammar schools or direct democracy, to name but a few?

**Product claims:** The claims are 3 blocks of text waffle so here's the bullet points on the box instead.

* *Repairs signs of aging &amp; sun damage with ferulic acid &amp; retinol*
* *Fades dark spots with azelaic amino acid &amp; bearberry*
* *Minimizes appearance of pores with salicylic acid &amp; willow bark*

**About you:** Combo dehydrated skin, prone to diet related break outs, sensitive to exfoliants.

**Your opinion:** Retinol is one of those slow progress actives and thanks to genetics I can't comment on it's effects on my so far non-existant wrinkles.

This is a cloudy yellowy and slightly thicker than water liquid that goes on nicely, if you're quick, I find it absorbs fast so it's a bit of a race against time but it does leave my skin feeling soft without a residue. It also has a distinct scent, I'm useless at describing scents but it's sort of metallic with something else and does linger if you don't apply something else on top.

Considering the ingredients list and the lack of irritation I've experienced this will most likely be a repurchase despite the price.

&gt;

&gt;__Luis Fernando Suárez__ (born December 23, 1959 in [Medellín](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn)) is a [Colombian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia) retired [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) player and currently unemployed after resigning as manager of [Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras_national_football_team) in 2014.

&gt;Suárez led the [Ecuador national football team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador_national_football_team) to the round of 16 at the [2006 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup) and won the 1999 Colombian championship with Atlético Nacional.  In 2005, he led Ecuador to their second consecutive [World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup). He has enjoyed hero status in [Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador) and [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia), leading [Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador_national_football_team) to their best showing in a [FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup) in [2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup). Reaching the second round by inflicting defeats on [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland_national_football_team) and [Costa Rica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica_national_football_team), they lost to [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team) 1-0 after a [David Beckham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham) free kick sailed into the net. 

&gt;Suárez was offered to keep coaching the Ecuadorian national team till the next [World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup) in 2010. Following a poor [Copa America 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_America_2007), many people wanted him out. Suárez stated that he would not resign and would improve his results. Suárez got off to the worst possible start for the [2010 World Cup qualifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(CONMEBOL\)), losing 1-0 at home to [Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela_national_football_team) and receiving a 5-0 hammering by [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team). After another hammering defeat 5-1 to [Paraguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay_national_football_team), he resigned irrevocably his position as head coach, immediately after the end of the match, on October 2009 he signed with [Juan Aurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Aurich) a Peruvian football team.

It's good to have a plan but then part of the beauty of these holidays is that nothing is rigid. You can stay longer if the place deserves an extra day, or move on early if it is rubbish. Obviously you should decide that before booking two nights.

*Perfect as an enhancement to seal in other NuFountain serums, CelSignal is enriched with antioxidants and oil-free moisture to nourish and support skin youthfulness. Wonderful for all skin types, CelSignal promotes a smooth, hydrated, resilient and glowing complexion.*

*Fragrance &amp; colorant-free. Serum has a silky-feel and a slight natural color. Made under strict, rigorous standards, with a high attention to detail.*

**About you:** Combo dehydrated skin, prone to diet related break outs, sensitive to exfoliants.

**Your opinion:** This stuff is super watery and unlike the majority of other vitamin c serums the yellow is really faint so you could easily mistake it for a bottle of overpriced water. Doesn't feel silky (feels like water) nor does it leave my skin silky, just bare as if just washed or splashed with water and dried.

&gt; Where to find places to stay? What are the different areas of town, where best to stay?

I think too many newcomers make the mistake of moving into the city centre, its bloody expensive and Brighton's small enough to get to the city centre fairly quickly from elsewhere.

For 20-somethings London Road, Lewes Road, The Level, Seven Dials, Western Road, Kemp Town are all pretty reasonable and popular areas. Price goes down if you're willing to make the effort and go to the Hove areas like Blatchington Road

false,[deleted],null,null,"Reasonable question. I have several reasons.

The first is that I was raised for some years in Australia. Australia has a fantastic immigration system that puts skilled migrants first, and unskilled migrants are welcome to visit, but not to stay. Students are welcome. The system (up until Abbott came in and was a massive dickhead) worked fantastically well.

I don't buy this ""racism"" smear. One thing that comes up a lot and indeed on the BBC today was ""without immigrants the NHS would be doomed due to all the foreign workers"". Yes absolutely, don't dispute it for a second. But this shows a lack of reading policy, UKIP wants to limit unskilled migration. Mimicking an Australian system. That is to say skilled migrants from abroad will continue to be welcome.

The second response is that I am very fed up of hearing one very illogical point made about migrants. ""british people won't do the jobs so we get migrants who are harder working"". This doesn't make sense. Firstly because economically speaking when a job is unpopular it is because it is a crap job and the pay will rise in order to compensate people for such crap jobs. We know minimum wage is too low, and the reason businesses have no incentive to increase it is because they can always find bods to fit the job. When you have unskilled migrants in a large capacity you interfere with the natural drive of demand for wages in supply of human capital. This is bad for our society as a whole, especially if the migrant then sends money back abroad which constitutes a leakage in our economic model. Secondly it is incredibly hypocritical to be offended at the idea that someone might suggest a bad word about unskilled migrants, then loudly slander your own people with the same abuse and think you can get away with it.

So that is the immigration point dealt with.

But finally, I know UKIP won't win. That is why I am voting for them. That seems counter intuitive. But when UKIP rises in significant enough support they hold small leverage, and the way the political landscape is working no individual party will hold a majority. UKIP will have a bit of an edge, much as the lib dems did previously, they're a dying party. I want the rhetoric to change, I want immigration to be discussed openly and fixed, without smear and fear of racism so we can address the major problem and move on. To a large extent I am also eurosceptic but I am open to the idea of European Union negotiation to get us a deal better suited to us.

But the party doesn't have to win, for those conversations to happen. They just have to be seen to have made a dent. The second that happens, UKIP has done its job. They never needed to win. Likely as anything a coalition government will form with the Conservatives and UKIP. It'll be a small majority with the comparison and Cameron knows it, this is why immigration and EU harsh talk has softened in the lead up to the election. I can stomach another term of Conservatives with UKIP in order to a) continue on the path of economic improvement and b) address what are genuine issues with immigration that I have thought were issues ever since I saw the aussie model and compared them first hand. Then next election after this one I'll vote in whoever is best suited based on the policies they have to offer for Britain at the time.

Problem is - labour has no genuine policies, Ed Milliband is a weak leader who seems willing to say anything for an edge - and his policies are wish washy statements ""more jobs"". What does that mean? Everyone wants more jobs. How are you going to deliver them Ed? You need substance not slogans.

We had a two goal lead that we never looked like giving up, and he didn't even bring him on in the more 'dangerous' position in front of defence but for Fabregas where it's less likely an error would cost us a goal. Was a fantastic opportunity to give him 90 minutes of Champions League action against a team desperate to qualify but instead he got 10 minutes where it was hard to fault him but if we're honest hard to praise him too much as well. Even if he didn't want to start him he deserved at least 20-30 minutes off the bench. 


There's not a lot about Mourinho I don't like, but at times his overly cautious nature and risk averse attitude towards younger players is very frustrating. We have some extremely talented young players at the club right now and I fear they will never be trusted to make the step up. Time will tell. 


On a more positive note Schurrle looked like he was getting back towards his best after some really abject performances of late, seems that whatever illness he had really took it out of him and hopefully he's fully over it now and can start making a real contribution in the Premier League.  I've always liked that he was a bit more direct and willing to shoot than any of our other attacking midfielders.

As an example I grew up in a large ""village"" in Somerset (Cheddar). To get to the nearest ""city"", Wells, you can either drive (20-30 minutes) or take the bus (30-40 minutes). The travel time is similar but buses stop at half six, plus Wells isn't the best place for overall shopping/entertainment.

For that you need to at least go to the nearest large town, Weston-Super-Mud. Driving is half an hour, by bus it's 45-55 minutes stopping at 8pm (so no seeing evening films). Weston-Super-Mare is not the most cultural nor does it has the most educated jobs nor does it have an airport. For stuff like that you need to go to the nearest major city, Bristol.

Driving there from Cheddar takes 40 minutes, by public transport you first have to go to Weston via bus (45 minutes) and then get either a train (40 minutes) or another bus (an hour). It takes nearly two hours to get there and don't forget the buses at Weston stop at 8pm. All this is getting to places with ""good"" public transport, I haven't even talked about getting to other rural communities where public transport is high on non-existent.

What people forget in the immigration debate is while we are arguing about how good or bad immigration is, the gap between rich and poor is becoming bigger, our assets are being sold off, and the banking industry is screwing us over on a daily basis.. a vote to UKIP or the conservatives is a vote to prop up that.. given that most of financial backers and elected representatives are bankers/stockbrokers... UKIP does not represent the working man.

Immigration is a problem at the moment because people are not being paid an equal amount and employers are getting away with some shocking employment practices.. the unions power is being gradually eroded.

UKIP are winning seats, and they have elected politicians, they take a considerable amount of taxpayers money from the EU and Local Councils, and what exactly have they done for us apart from say ""The EU is bad"".

I am not saying we shouldnt have a discussion on the EU or immigration, but it is nowhere near as simple as EU and immigration are bad and good... UKIP do not allow that discussion.

Labour do have some good policies, far more and far more workable than UKIP - go and look up some of their stuff, they really want to talk about issues like housing, the gap between rich and poor, equality, health.. its easy to just say Ed Milliband is a weak leader, we are spoon fed that by the media.

The Greens and to be fair the Lib Dems have some fantastic stuff to, lets be honest it is easy for us all to bandwagon and say how bad the Lib Dems are, without them a conservative government would have been far worse.

Your vote is important, and everyone will have different viewpoints, but UKIP are dangerous.. i also feel it is easy to band about ""the aussie model"" .. Australia is a different country all together.. the grass is not always greener..

 There is a lot of strange things going on, and I believe some things could be more political than others. Like Borini going missing right before a major transfer window, in the most intense part of the season. He is one of the most dedicated proffesionals I've seen, not a troublemaker. So why? BR could be pushing the issue of the striker crisis. FSG will most likely be reluctant to fund any new purchase, unless there is desperate need for it.

I saw this study, it didn't acceptably make a distinction between skilled and unskilled migration. A successful doctor for instance will make more than, and account for 2 or 3 unskilled migrants. There is nothing absolutely wrong with migration, there is a big issue with unskilled migration.

You are right about the right poor divide. I was reading into the agricultural subsidy and an interesting point was made that the UK fought against capping it. The Guardian and the Telegraph argued that it was because the majority of those in receipt of it for large farm properties were very rich and it provided a very bare faced way to take from the tax payer. I don't know enough of it to debate this however.

Labour had a decade to do it and did a terrible job, they are still filled with the same guys as before. I can't consciously vote those guys in again because I still remember how it all felt. Anyway the problem with their policies as I said, is that they are largely buzz. ""We want to tackle the gap between rich and poor"". Right they said it last time, that is a problem, why didn't they do it last decade? What do they mean by that? What real, tangible goalposts will they actually set, do and deliver on? It's all airy fairy waffle and thatis my problem.

The Greens... They have some great policies, but a couple of their policies are so far off the mark as to make voting for them something I can't consciously choose to do.  Anyway I lived in Australia, to be perfectly honest it's not that different.

What I would say is we should take the best things from the best places. Portugal's drug and rehab policy, Australia's immigration policy - these guys, these western countries have given us working models for fantastic systems and were stare them in the face and say no purely on the grounds of a status quo nobody is happy with.

And then not only did he not try to win the Basel game, but he doesn't seem particularly disappointed.  Here is a group that Liverpool absolutely should have made it out of, but it seems like they didn't even try...  

And then when you have poor performances one after another, Rodgers just stays the course and blames others, or bad luck?  Come on, change something.  Put on Borini and Lallana at the same time or something, play Emre Can for once, and save the older players (Gerrard and Lambert) as impact subs.  Gerrard can still be great if he plays 20-30 minutes a game, he's a liability playing 90 minutes a game, every game...

I mean, they needed goals against Basel, yet after Lambert was subbed off at half, there were no strikers playing.

&gt;You are right about the right poor divide.

I find these are closely linked. Unskilled migrants are poor and not very prosperous in their own country because there are no jobs. They come to the UK to find a job were they are in direct competition with someone from the UK who doesn't have a job because there are none or limited jobs. Therefore the few unskilled jobs have a high demand and the companies offering these low skill jobs have a race to the bottom to fill the role, so they can make more money from this exploitation to further expand their bottom line.

It doesn't matter who gets the job because they will barely have enough to live off anyway and because there is no spending the people who have the money aren't lending and therefore small business ventures that could employ them both can't get off the ground.  

And the person with the least power in the whole populous to change this ""the unable to vote immigrant"" is being blamed? And your solution to this is to employ the very people who riches were made from this scenario to change this. It's not very likely.

Back in the day, due to us having a parliament and taxing people and what, we taxed damn near everyone. What did this mean? It meant the government had more money, yes. But what did they spend it on? Well, during the Seven Years War, we spent it on ships. Lots and lots of ships. So much so, we fielded (Oceaned?) The largest navy in the world at that time. Then we went to war with France for the shits, mainly because they were taking up too much space in North America as well as we just didn't like them very much.

This war was played out very cleverly by Britain, who, beforehand, had decided to ally herself with Prussia. Now, Prussia doesn't exist today for the reason that it was so damn good at fighting everyone else had to team up together to get rid of it. Seem familiar? That little team up was called *World War II.* After that Prussia was abolished. *Abolished.*

The point I'm making here is that Prussia was a big hitter back in it's day. At this point in time, they fielded the most formidable land force in the world. So France had the best army and the best navy against them. *Clever move there, Louis.* So we let the Prussians do all the ""boots on the ground"" dealy and we did the ""boots on the decks"" stuff.

Now, if you'll look at a map, you'll notice one, and only one, thing in between France and America. It's a big blue wet thing called the ""Atlantic Ocean."" This ""Atlantic Ocean"" had lots of little wooden things flying British flags in them, so named the Royal Navy. What the RN did here was to blockade the French ports and stop trade. Due to the severity of the British blockade, the French couldn't supply their colonies, so they lost them. In fact, our might was so great, they *planned* on losing them.

What did this do in the long run? Well it pissed the French off something fierce, who massively ramped up their military expenditure once the Americans had declared independence to go and help them out. Admittedly, yes, we lost that war, but we were playing the long con, see? While we raised taxes too much in North America, France raised them too much back home. There's just one difference, and that's in the people taxed. See, we taxed damn near everyone. The French? Oh, they only taxed the peasants. Which they didn't like. So they ended up killing their king.

false,practically_floored,newcr-1,,"First of all, the metro is talking out of it's arse (as always) about Liverpool and Spurs, there is absolutely no chance Kev would ever play for either of them - especially the shite, he hates them and they hate him, because he's a massive snide in every derby. Plus we hardly ever sell players to each other and Kev likes the Everton fans too much to do something like that to piss them off.

I've been thinking a lot about this though. On one hand, Kev is 27 and he's a quality winger, I could imagine he may consider moving to a team that gets CL every season if one came in for him. This makes me think that we might end up losing him this summer, as with his contract running down we wouldn't risk losing him for nothing.

On the other hand, where is he going to go? Nowhere in the prem, he already turned down Arsenal for us in the first place, and anyway they have enough starting wingers (Sanchez, Walcott, Ox, they even play Ozil on the wing) that Kev would struggle for game time. IMO he's too inconsistent and injury prone to get into any other prem team that is actually better than us (eg Chelsea, City), especially as the starter that he would want to be. 

He's spoken in the past about wanting to play in Spain, but we can all agree that Barca, Real and even Atletico are out of his reach realistically. I guess maybe Bilbao or Sevilla but neither are guaranteed CL. Then there's Germany, obviously not Bayern, there is Dortmund who will likely sell their winger Reus in the near future, but Mirallas is no real replacement, considering that Reus is younger and easily world class. They're also likely to be out of the CL next year. Would the other teams want/be able to afford him?

After that, he'd be going to a poorer domestic league if he wanted CL football, and he already left a club where he had CL football in Greece to play for us because the prem is at a higher standard.

Overall, I think there aren't too many options for him to get CL football, although he'd probably be able to find somewhere if he really wanted it. You have to consider though, that he also said he's very happy at Everton, and that contract negotiations are ongoing - adding that **""we both want different things""** from the contract, but saying the club and him are on good terms. So, maybe he's trying to gain some leverage over the club to get a better deal on his new contract? I can see there is a chance of us losing him, but I don't think it's out of the question to think he's probably just trying to get more money in his new deal.",0,1418261143,null,0,false,0,cmrde0i,t3_2ox90s,t1_cmrde0i,t3_2ox90s,null,1425494388,13,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,13

thats not to say neoliberalism is sustainable at all, infinite growth cant work with finite resources, though in that regard a large welfare state seems little less, and perhaps even more wasteful. but anyway i think the biggest problem with everything here is the assumption that being richer will make everything better, materialism, both ways of thinking are two sides of the same coin of massive consumption and the view that the only thing of any value is money/stuff. which is completely unsustainable and i think not very helpful if overall happiness is the goal.",0,1418261197,null,0,false,0,cmrdf08,t3_2ov95g,t1_cmrdf08,t3_2ov95g,null,1425494375,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

From the top of my head:


The French NT problems (a large stint) Most recently the controversy for not being called to Brazil WC. His GF didn't help either he called publicly Deschamps a shit manager (""Fuck france and fuck deschamps! What a shit manager"" notice the fuck france bit, not cool, one could argue that Nasri's GF doesn't represent Samir, but he did nothing to cool the situation)
After that, he quit NT (after not being called of course). He said French NT is not worth his family suffering. He blamed, the media, the manager and even his teammates (press said that some teammates didn't want him on the French NT, Nasri believed the press and said that he doesn't want to share the lockeroom with teammates that can't talk to him directly. Not cool. (I think he has some fair points, French media was a bitch with him, and his family was harassed -again, after his GF episode, no surprises here- but he could've worded it better.

With Arsenal he has repeatedly insulted the fans and the club alike. To be fair, Arsenal fans harassed him pretty badly when he moved to city. When he won the title at city with Mancini he said:
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; ""People at Arsenal tried to make out that I came here for the money, I hope they are watching me now, collecting my Premier League winner’s medal. I believe they have not won a trophy for many years now.""

Of course what he said I think is no lie and It's a fair point. But you have to know better, you have to be better. Not saying that footballers need to be role models, but just don't be a dick.

TL:DR If 1% of Samir talent could be swapped into speak his thoughts in a less confrontational manner and more judgement, specially when you are dealing with shitty press that will do anything to grab a headline. 
I think Samir has some fair points, but he could be less of a dick and a little bit more humble to be more likable. For the record, I give a shit, if he plays like he does every week, he and his GF can badmouth whatever they want.

I don't believe Rodgers to be the right man for Liverpool. Even last season I had my reservations. I feel this season has added credence to that thought. I feel last season was more down to 2 players in insane form and a couple of youngsters buzzing on a high, rather than because of the tactics employed by the manager.

I believe this season he has been found out. He is continuing to pick formations that aren't working, seriously it's 4 months into the season, a lone striker hasn't worked so far why persist with it?

Skrtel, Johnson, Lovren, Gerrard, Henderson have all looked woefully out of form and yet up until the last few weeks (when we've actually picked up some wins) they've all been first names on the team sheet. I can understand a manager sticking with AN out of form player in the hopes he'll come good, but to persist with half a team for a half a season smacks of a manager who has no idea what to do.

Our defense is woeful. Let's not beat around the bushes, it's one of the worst in the league. 2 weeks ago we'd defended 29 set pieces and conceded on 13 of them. Far and away the worst in the league. But Rodgers claimed there was no problem and our back line doesn't require specialist coaching. Really? REALLY? Sounds like a man with an ego so big he can't see the forest through the trees.

After the abject performance in Ludogoretz and at home Sunderland he rubbished on about character and how fantastic the players were. He was watching a different match, or believes the players and fans are idiots as to believe that was the case. The players look low on confidence, woefully out of form and in the cases of a few players utterly disinterested.

His transfers and reluctance to use them is also a worry. Lallana has looked the only player capable of unlocking a defense, yet he spends more time on the bench and Coutinho, a player again way out of form is given the minutes. We spend 20 million on one of Europes brightest attacking players in Markovic and he sees shit all game time. Can has looked a beast when played, especially against Chelsea, the league leaders, but like others sees no game in time in favor of players out of the form.

I respect your view, fuck it's one I wish I could share, I enjoy reading the opposite perspective it opens my eyes to things I may missed or not considered.

""If I can help score goals for the team, I'll do my maximum to do it.""

The subtitles say to win at home in a manner, but it really should be ""to win at home in style.""

To me the last answer isn't ""it's a lofty position"" rather he says ""it's our proper place."" Much more confident.

The woman who wrote it has moved ""from being the girl who was always the lead in the school play"" to being a person who is struggling to deal with everyday life long after her period of hard times. The effect on her is also affecting her family.

Drawing from her experiences to make some generalisations people like her and the LBC phone-in man will tend to find it harder to become productive members of society, working hard and paying taxes. The damage to these people's lifetime productivity is far more expensive than the cost of an adequate welfare system.

Hardly anyone sits out of work for decades. The people being hit by poverty and welfare sanctions are people who are generally hardworking and productive people down on their luck temporarily.

false,questionman1,null,null,"This is exactly the reason.  The funny thing is that he went about it in the most diplomatic, and professional way possible.

1.) All he did was refuse to sign a new contract.  In the summer of 2011, the Cesc saga dominated the transfer market, and it was late in the season when fans learned about Nasri's refusla to sign a new contract.  Of course they failed to take into account that his refusal was in may.

2.) He stayed quiet during the entire saga and played very well when called upon in the Liverpool game.  He was the only shining performance in a team in complete disarray.  This is also when Arsenal fans first began (as far as I know) their despicable Nasri chant.

3.) The summer was a disaster for Arsenal.  With Wenger promising not to sell Cesc or Nasri...the whole ""Arsenal is nto a selling club,"" etc etc etc.  It also included the famous 8-2 loss against arch rivals Man Utd.  Which concluded with a whole bunch of reactionary signings, a lot of whom (like Andre Santos, Park Chu-Young (who was very unfairly treated)), did not work out.  Their marquee signing of the summer, Gervinho, Wenger really wasn't utilizing him well.

4.) Arsenal was a club that SEEMED to be in decline...in the last game of the season City beat them to 3rd; forcing Arsenal to qualiify for teh CL.  It included a very stressful CL qualifying match against Udinese (I remember RVP's post match interview where he showed so much relief.  He also said, now we have money so let's go buy some players...which is a very bold thing for a player to say).

5.) Basically to summarize; Arsenal fans needed an outlet for their frustration.  They found it in Nasri.  Cesc couldn't be called a mercenary, because ""he was going home."" But the fact that Nasri's refusal of signing a new contract (another mismanagement by Arsenal, he only had one year left on his contract) was a surprise, they called him a mercenary.  Remember back then City were seen as a club with money ruining football; they would never win trophies despite winning the FA cup.  No one could believe that Nasri wanted to go and win trophies.  No one believed that City was a club going somewhere.

6.) There are some revisionists, but Nasri made comments against the Arsenal fan base well into his tenure at Man City.  Which in my opinion were fairly accurate.  Arsenal had become very hostile, and even when new faces appeared on the team, like Coquelin, and Jenkinson, and other youngsters, they were met with boos.  Nasri, who gave the only shining performance against Liverpool...when his transfer wasn't final, was given a very hostile reception.

But these comments were made well after his transfer concluded.  During the entire summer, he was very professional and stayed quiet.  Yet even then, on r/gunners, he was getting blasted.",0,1418271489,null,0,false,0,cmriiki,t3_2owkac,t1_cmriiki,t1_cmr6t58,null,1425491804,8,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,8

Is that because being ""left-wing"" is inherently bad? No, it's because Hollande is a drippy spineless moron, who can't control his cabinet.

Down under right-winger Tony Abbott is collapsing in the polls. Is that because conservatism is inherently unpopular? No, it's because he is a gaffe-prone oddity with no sense of PR and who openly contradicts his leading cabinet ministers.

If you look at the history of American Presidents they entirely sink or swim on the basis of their personalities. Look at someone like Richard Nixon - who had sorta reasonable policies on paper, but was defeated by his insane melodramatic personality. And after him Carter, who also had some decent policies, but was unable to enforce them due to a naive mind. Bush II's failings was not because he was right-wing, but because he had a tendancy to ignore what his underlings did and over-promote people. Obama, like John Quincy Adams and his father, have failings entirely based on his personal coolness - some might say elitism - over Congress, frustrating his agenda.

This season, he is having to deal with things he has no experience in yet. Champions League football, multiple (3+) games a week, EXPECTATION that we could win the league, losing massive massive key players (Suarez).

He has shown in the past he can adapt, it's just unfortunate for me that the job he is in is so cut throat. Hell if I was given the same amount of slack in any job I was in, then I would be fired pretty quick too :D (I know the argument this is why he is paid what he is, and is at the level he is at etc. but the arguement on his inexperience still stands).

false,lak47,lfc87,,"It's going to be a long post, but I'm going to try and argue some of his article:

&gt; 1. People will say that Liverpool needed a world-class replacement for Suarez, but Daniel Sturridge scored 21 league goals last season; having a fit Sturridge would have gone a long way to obviating some of the problems. He’s had injury problems in the past, but never like this.

Ok, so let me get this straight. Tomkins says you can ply your trade with one striker? Who already has an injury history? No doubt when he's firing he's unstoppable, but that is naive, naive at best. ""But never like this"" - you already KNOW he has a history with injuries, were you waiting to test out the severity of it at the time when you're losing your best player? Are you mad? Or are you Rodgers? 

&gt; 2.The trouble with overachieving in a season is that if you don’t get off to a good start the next season there’s a greater sense of disappointment than is fair and logical. Like a team who are promoted a year too early, and aren’t ready for the Premier League, Liverpool weren’t ready for the Champions League (although should still have won more than a single game). The jump from 7th to 2nd was fun, but some of our helium balloons were always going to pop.

Tomkins says we overachieved last year. Several of us understand very very clearly that we were not going to win the league this term. We are not stupid and we see Chewsea and City and United strengthen, we knew the competition will be tough, we know the challenge.

But he forgets WHY this disappointment. People are tired of the lack of fight, the limp lame motherfucking tactics, the same shit every week, the lack of ideas. People are upset because the CHALLENGE in itself has not been risen to. There has been no fight. There has been no spirit we saw last term. 

&gt; 3. If adding a world-class striker to your team is the solution, why are Arsenal, who have done just that with Alexis Sanchez, currently 6th, when after 15 games, without one, they were top last December? .......(The one exception of recent times being Atletico Madrid, with possibly Dortmund a second example, although they’re having a nightmare season in the league, to show that good things can go badly wrong.)

Because their manager has lost the plot? Just like ours? Some of the common things between us and Arsenal this term: The defences look clueless. There is no DMF cover. The managers are not ready to change things. 

&gt; 4. I came down in favour of him and his methods. 

Which one is it? He overachieved? Or his methods were good? If his methods were good, what happened now? If we overachieved, then why is he still trying to convince everyone that Rodgers is OK?

&gt; 5. If I thought things were going to stay like this under Rodgers I’d accept the clamour to see him sacked. If this is truly his ‘level’, then get rid. But while I’m not convinced he’s in the top echelon of managers, he and his team are better than this. Even if things don’t get better by the summer I wouldn’t say he had to be sacked, but equally, if things get no better it becomes ever harder to say the club must stick with him.

This I fully agree with. But I think as with Hodgson, the cries were deafening to give him a fair chance just before he got the boot. I think we're going to see another scenario like this. Rodgers had the Basel game to buy him time. He didnt capitalize. You know who we play over the weekend, if we lose (I think we will) that's going to be nail number 2 in the coffin.

As for the shopping centre it's a bit meh. As one guy said up there, that person is from Cambridge. Even the Grafton Centre is a shit hole no wonder she is going Norwich. Worse than Queensgate. There is always worse.  

 Peterborough is fine. Get your qualifications, experience ect then move on. We all have to start somewhere and you're only 21 for fucks sake. You'll find something to do. Meet a few inbreds, I mean friends.

But before you head there, it's worth giving you a feeling for the situation. Immigration is an extremely hot topic in the UK for the last few years, and as a result the government has made it extremely difficult for non-EU citizens to come and live here. 

On the plus side an engineering degree is a very good start, but you're unlikely to get a work visa with just a bachelor's degree and no experience. It would help enormously if you got a master's and had five years or so relevant working experience.

To get a work visa for a foreigner a company essentially has to explain to the government that there was nobody local who could do that job. Depending on the exact vacancy, ""local"" could expand to include the entire EU.

But here's the difference. Messi had lasted 90 minutes for Barcelona 25 times before his 20th birthday, Ronaldo 30 for Sporting and Manchester United. Sterling's done it 49 times for Liverpool. He's a special talent, absolutely. But if two of the greatest players of all time -- both precocious superstars -- were being used far more sparingly at teenagers than Sterling is, perhaps there's a reason.""

false,hopelessnoob,null,null,"Many people seem to want to keep Rodgers for stability. When the season started and we went doing well I was of the same opinion. Keep Rodgers and let him sort things out. 

It has been about half the season, the team still does not look much better as compared to when we started the league. Rodgers has also made many weird choices as pointed out by the OP. With talented players like Moreno, sakho etc all not getting time. He has also been stubbornly playing some players like lorvern who was under performing for a long time. This makes me suspect that there is a divide in the club which we don't know of. 

Many people have been saying that we don't have sturridge and when he comes back all will be fine. I have high hopes but I doubt that we will suddenly play much better. The only good thing is that it forces Rodgers to change the team as sturridge will definitely be in the starting 11.

People have also been blaming the transfer committee but we are not sure what influence they really have. How many of the signings were the ones that Brenden made. Did the committee sign sakho or Moreno which is why Brenden does not play them. 

We don't know many things that happen in the club and most likely never will. However Rodgers does not seem to be willing to change even when we are not doing well. When I watch is play now, it reminds me of moyes' man U, they have one plan and he just tried it again and again and again. 

Rodgers style of play also seems very different as compared to last season where we were very quick on the counter and not so much of the pass and death by possession we see trying to be implemented now. It does not seem to be working and Rodgers does not seem to want to give it up. 

A new manager will possibly shake things up and force some changes which are badly needed. Since top 4 still looks possible, we should allow Rodgers a chance to fight for his job but if we drop even further down, it will be a good time to transition.

You might say what about tax, or the short career of footballers, but think about this. Imagine someone on 100k pounds/year, which is heaps, probably like 4 times the average yearly salary or something, it would take them 36 years to earn that much pre-tax money, and although they might be paying less tax (don't know how the UK do their income taxes), its probably still more in the players' favour because of the time value of money. This is of course assuming that people earn 100k/pounds a year straight out of college which they don't, and usually takes many years to get anywhere near that kind of salary. 

I mean its difficult to think about from our perspective, where for pretty much anyone else, an increase in pay will have a clear impact on our lifestyle. Moving from 10k to 20k a year, 20k to 30k, etc. But once you've covered your expenses and the bigger assets like a house, you have a crazy amount of excess money.

I've had a lot of responses to my original comment, not all as genuinely interested as yourself, some simply to call me a racist. This has got me asking myself some questions. I was born in this town, lived here my whole life, and I've watched my neighbourhood change from an English community with English culture, to a ""multi-cultural"" one. By which I mean Islamic because although other cultures may be present, its the Islamic one which is now prevalent. Pubs were closed, mosques and halal butchers/restaurants were opened. The people also changed, the amount of my neighbours who moved out of the area was shocking. Walking down the high street recently and the amount of men in full islamic dress and women in full veil makes you feel like you could be in another country. They also make no secret of their disdain for my presence. I'm either ignored or stared at in a way which makes me uncomfortable.
I've asked myself is it racist to want my children to grow up in the same environment and culture that I did? If I wanted that now I would have to move. Rotherham is not the only town with gangs of muslim men who prey on young girls, I have a daughter who's recently turned 8 and aswell as all the normal fatherly worries, I now have the added worry that she will be forced to grow up in an area where a number of these gangs are known to operate.

I ordered some hard drives and other PC parts and chose ""timed delivery"" on Wednesday, because that was the only day I was going to be at home all day. So guess what? They attempted to deliver it on Tuesday. On Wednesday when I checked my delivery status I found that my delivery has been rescheduled - without telling me on when. When I called Yodel support they said it is still going to be delivered on Wednesday and I should wait. OK... so I checked parcel tracking again in few hours and it could not recognise my tracking ID anymore. It was gone. lol. Then I knew I am not going to get delivered shit that day. I called **eBuyer** and asked them to cancel all that crap order. They agreed and said that Yodel will return it to them and they will process my refund. Next day morning (Thursday) - just as I was about to go to work - I got Yodel at my doors with my parcel. Fuck you I thought, and told the poor guy to take it back. I just noticed big red writing on the parcel **""WENDESDAY""**. HA! That is their sophisticated ""timed delivery"" system in action!   
Then it took damn eBuyer another 10 days to get my parcel back from Yodel so they can process my refund. In the meantime I was calling them explaining that refund should be processed immediately - irrelevant if they got their parcel from Yodel or not, as it is their business to sort it out, but no luck.  
  
**Fuck eBuyer and fuck Yodel**. This is not the first time the above 2 companies screwed up and wasted my time, but this time was too much.   
  
They are the most incompetent pieces of shit in the industry. I was using eBuyer mostly because I did not agree with Amazon avoiding taxes and treating their workers like shit. But fuck it  - if it is going to cost me my so much wasted time and money to deal only with ""ethical"" companies - I opt out.  
  
I started using Overclockers now as much as I can, they seem smaller than eBuyer, but at least they are efficient.

Interesting that you use two English flatmates to argue 'a massive proportion relatively speaking' - are they also the same age as you, ie too young to have been alive when the person you're slagging was in power? (and wtf does that phrase mean exactly? Is that what you use when you can't say majority?) 

And in any case, the disgusting loudmouth 'celebrations' that occurred in places like the Falls Rd after her death are no indication of mainstream public opinion.

He does really nice turns and skills, but our manager hasn't figured out how and where to play him yet. Wich is a shame, a talent like him should be used as much as possible. 

Our transfers over the last two years have been shocking, and even bizarre. Rodgers is buying players who offer the exact opposite of what we though he liked, like Balotelli. But the committee is just as responsible as Rodgers in terms of transfers. Very little value for money, wich is bad since value for money is our bread and butter. 

I hope he doesn't lose the squad, but with his strange tactical choices and bad judgement there comes a possibility of him losing respect in the dressingroom. Not good. 

I don't think we can blame the new players too much, they are a product of their manager. They have to be coached into the team. And our backbone with players from other managerial periods is a strong one, so there is a foundation there for the new players. They just have not bern coached properly into the side, and that goes down to how Rodgers has changed things around so much this season. He has tried it all really, and looks yet to figure it out.

I also hope that there isn't too many clicks in the squad, you know, like the brits are only with the brits, and the spanish speaking are only with the spanish speaking...",0,1418289722,null,0,false,0,cmro9uz,t3_2oxijm,t1_cmro9uz,t3_2oxijm,null,1425489047,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

false,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; The sickening theory of laissez-faire capitalism finally died with the recent report from one of the West’s leading think tanks.

We haven't learned anything new about laissez-faire frankly. It was always the case that optimum from a laissez-faire perspective was never optimum from a social perspective. For instance starvation is a completely normal free market response to under supply of food as Revolutionary France found out. It has always been the case where pragmatic free market capitalism was pursued with an eye for defending against socially intolerable results of the free market. That is why we tend to favour over supplying food. That is why we have an anti-laissez-faire concept such as intellectual property. Know what we cannot tolerate to lose and make the minimum interference to achieve that end (in theory, there is nothing minimum about modern IP).

All we are reaching is the lowest point of the redistribution/growth political cycle. 5 years ago the idea that inequality harms growth was laughed at (despite the obviousness of it). Today it is an idea taking on increased mindshare. 5 years from now it will be the dominant thought but restrained by a still strong neo-liberal mindset. 20 years from now the idea that high taxes can harm growth will be laughed at (despite the obviousness of it).

I doubt we have the maturity to find a balance between these factors. The time needed to actually demonstrate the truth or falsehood of these ideas is comparable to the life time of a person. For entire generations the truth of neo-liberalism or redistribution is all they know and that means political change requires whole generations to go into minority.",0,1418289768,null,0,1418289956,0,cmroa6z,t3_2ov95g,t1_cmroa6z,t3_2ov95g,null,1425489041,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Best way there is down Newhall Street because we still have the 1960s' relic of a mini-motorway cutting the city centre in half.  This is being put underground in the next decade.

Nigel Farage has certainly made some controversial comments in the past, the Romanians one possibly being one of the worst. UKIP is not a racist organisation however, the party is not about being anti-foreigner or blaming immigrants themselves, it's about the immigration rules itself and the strain it's putting on our country.

UKIP seems to actively go out it's way to stamp racism, they are the only party which prevents people from racist organisations from joining them, if you are or have been a British National Party, National Front, British Freedom Party, British People's Party, English Defence League, Britain First or UK First party member. When proper racism is found in their party, [they are kicked out as soon as possible](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukip-member-kicked-out-attending-britain-first-mega-mosque-march-1475692).

UKIP also has a fair bit of diversity throughout their party, if they are so racist, why would those people join UKIP and campaign for their cause?

UKIP also isn't the only party with some contraversial comments as I'm sure you might agree, other parties have members which have been ex-members of some certain groups, who've said many stupid things or even done stupid things, some parties seem to prefer to cover it up as well.

In some cases more benefits make people poorer by making them less likely to find work, a so called poverty trap. Universal benefits which are not means-tested can be a good way around this. 

Investments in education are also key. As the author pointed out  the disparities in educational outcomes between rich and poor kids was one of the main drivers of the widening gap and under-education of clever poor kids was one of the main reasons why inequality harmed growth. 

Making sure everyone, regardless of social background, get a good education really is one of the best social investments possible AFAIK. 

Raising top tax rates is usually not a good idea (depends on the current rate ofc) but people being superrich is not a problem, people being poor is. The accusations of rich ppl ""hoarding cash"" damaging growth is nonsense as this is what drives capital accumulation and long term growth. Having a broad tax base with lower rates make more sense.

I just read the intro for Adam Curtis' new film ([article here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/posts/TRAILER-TRASH)), and he makes the good point that: Politicians and others no longer have the conceptual frameworks to understand what's going on. In his example, he refers to Afghanistan, but I think it applies more generally.

It's true of everyone that the conceptual frameworks you hold, perhaps unwittingly, in-form how you see the world. As these become limited, impoverished, you literally see the world in a simple way *without realising it*. The complexities just become background. It's as if, been brought up with the colour ""green"", you could no longer see ""red"" or ""blue"". Or better: Having grown up without a sense of touch, you not only did not feel things, *you didn't realise there was such a thing and that you didn't have it*.

Politicians and media folk are largely operating in their own bubble-worlds. Law is an inconvenience, or something to be shaped for your purposes. The ""other"" who commit crimes need punished not because they commit the crime, but because they're not part of your clique and so they have ""no right"" - what a cheek, to presume the privilege!

Everyone does, really - it's how we are able to operate in the world. It starts with blobs and lines and shapes turning into ""objects"" and ""parts"" as children, and it goes from there. However, one can be sensitive to the process, and to its effects, when it comes to more abstract frameworks.

What's important to realise is that *you literally and directly experience your assumptions and beliefs*. It's not a case of seeing something and thinking it. It's as immediate and embedded in your perception as seeing a table or a chair. Tables and chairs are a sort of ""belief"" in a way.

Once something has deterministic momentum, then it can only be derailed by a Massive Creative Intervention. Basically: an powerful random event.

Sakho has been injured for a while - I seriously doubt he's being kept out of the team out of spite, so that negates that argument too. He deserved to be dropped for a game or two for sulking and leaving the stadium that day, but he got injured soon after that. I don't reckon there's a big conspiracy there - he's on PhysioRoom as being back soon.

Things I agree with - two strikers needs to be given more of a chance, but I don't think he's confident in our defending yet, and I don't think he rates Borini. He tried it when he had a fit Sturridge and Balo and it worked wonders. That said, it's worth a try with Borini but he's not doing it for whatever reason.

I see this issue raised by a lot of people and it seems to be a bit vague - like saying we need a defensive coach but not picking a specific problem with our defence.

I don't think it follows a logical train of thought. It seems like saying ""we need to do more defendy things"" rather than something concrete that address a specific weakness (like sticking a competent DM in to plug our leaky midfield).

What is the actual issue with our transfer policy?
I don't think you can reasonably argue that the team we have available is worse in terms of quality than teams like West Ham or Southampton.

What is apparent is that we have no strikers. It has been a serious slog trying to get the ball out of midfield because there's nobody up front to pass it to most of the time.

We failed to sign either the right striker or enough strikers. That's a failure, but regardless of who's in charge, it has to be addressed by adding to the squad, even if it's just Origi.

It doesn't mean there has been a total breakdown in our ability to sign the right players. It just means we cocked up.

false,TriumphantGeorge,null,null,"&gt;I actually believe the whole reason governments all over the world are trying to curtail the internet is exactly what you describe as Massive Creative Intervention. I believe they are trying to derail the process which we were started on unintentionally by technological progress.

I see what you were going for! Yes, I'd agree. What's important is information. That's not to say that the top-dog political people have secret knowledge and know how things really are - that's not it at all.

Rather, their position is based on having the same world view they do. *That* is what would change. It's already frightening that they don't really understand the world, that it's changing from beneath them - Internet control is a way to prevent what they would perceive as ""extremist views"" taking a hold. 

In past times, ""extremist views"" would have been things such as ""black people are equal to white people"", ""gay people are not mentally defective, it's natural"", and so on. Today, ""it's not necessarily true that it's poor people's fault they're poor; it doesn't mean they're stupid or lazy"", and implicitly: ""we are clever and know best, as the elite, so we get to do what we want, because we are always right, even if it's illegal for other people, because it must be for the greater good"".

It's an emotional issue.

&gt;If you take the internet, and opensource software and expand it to slowly take over the world - you basically end up in Utopia.

It's a start. Add to that some method (whether that's through reading and discussion, or mindfulness, non-duality and lucid dreaming, or extreme snowboarding) of realising what your assumptions are - about yourself, about the world - and how they influence your perception, then you're getting pretty free. Doesn't necessarily mean you're *nice*, but at least you'll be operating from on open perspective.

&gt;When a 19 year old kid who (let's be honest) isn't even that great a footballer demands 100k a week, you have to ask yourself, as a human being, what does he do to deserve that?

He is an asset to a footballing business that values him at £100k per week. It's nothing to do with what he 'deserves'.

FIFA is corrupt, yes, but I'm not sure what this has to do with wages?

&gt;You say anfield is full, yeah but with who? Tourists or local fans?

Mostly local fans, because more than half of Anfield's capacity is taken up by season ticket holders. More than that again are on the waiting list.

They are indeed high, but they are high because there's a demand for them. Would you prefer some sort of communist version of ticket allocation?

Because that was what he was valued at as an asset. It hasn't paid off, but that's not the point.

&gt;Tbh I'm not having a go at you, it's just if you aren't a fan of a team that has some shady billionaire as the owner, what's the point anymore? Football isn't for the fans anymore, and players like sterling who throw their toys out of the pram are part of the problem.

Agger and Reina makes me think the ""everybody is just as important etc"" philosophy is just an act. Some players get way more slack than others it seems. And even though Sturridge will help, it is not enough having one guy making runs in behind. And he isn't going to help our defence. Rodgers needed to prepare for his way of playing this summer and I don't believe any committee robbed him of a chance for that his summer. Maybe they've made the best decisions and Rodgers is the problem. I don't know nor care, because our players at the moment are being managed badly and that's that for me. We've also been a little UNLUCKAY like Lucas would tell you, but we've also created some of our own misfortunes. 

Rodgers said himself he needs to make more good decisions than bad ones. He said you cant spend 100 mill and don't get results. Well, he's right and he needs to take action. 

Blame whatever but he has the resources to do better in all competitions. He could line up Moreno Sakho Skrtl Manquillo Lucas Hendo Sterling Coutinho Lallana Lambert one week and Enrique Sakho Kolo Johnson Can Allen Gerrard Borini Balo the next. That's changing 11 players. Mix them up, change tactics, use different combinations or whatever. The point is we should do better. Injuries happen, poor runs happen, but we deal with it. We adapt. A great managers makes good decisions, picks the right team and get results. Sir Alex won champions league games without defenders. He won big games with poor rated players. Surely we can compete for 4th and beat Basel and Ludogorets with our current squad. 

I work part time and study AND STILL I feel like I've got more plans for Liverpool, transfers, upcoming games etc. I know I'm not manager of Liverpool FC like BR but atleast I'm doing my job as a fan by thinking I know better. Sarcasm, yes, but still Brendan. Say we play fantastic after being below par many games in a row and you'll be on the first plane home.

**Edit/TLDR:** I don't mean to come off as super anti Rodgers but It's like having a fight/bad time with the SO. At the moment he's just really pissing me off at times. It doesn't mean I want him gone but if things doesn't change or a managerial Mila Kunis or whatever is up for grabs I wouldn't mind.",0,1418295907,null,0,1418296336,0,cmrpfan,t3_2oxijm,t1_cmrpfan,t1_cmrmj19,null,1425488510,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

If the question would really be asked, we'd just get a lot of platitudes unfortunately. Stuff about ""hard-working people"" and the ""freedom from crime and those who would do us harm"". What needed is almost a philosophical debate - but these guys don't really *have* a philosophy. That's one of the problems that's arisen from the ""career politician"". Your opinions are for hire (see Jack Straw as a great example).

There *is* no goal.

Not having a philosophy is a big problem, because it means your Government is actually run by the civil service and the security services. Time and again, you see the same policies and turnarounds occurring - see the relentlessness of ID cards for instance (Michael Howard onwards in recent times: Tories, Labour, Tories, Lib-dems, it never goes away).

And make no mistake, what's going on is basically still ""ID Cards"", although in the form of a ""data double"" for the country.

&gt;An interesting point is things like extreme police powers I can actually justify IF written into them is the point at which they stop existing

Well, the Patriot Act had a sunset clause. They just keep renewing it. Once you have such power, the only reason to relinquish is if, secretly, you've got something in place - or, you're not in power at the moment and this is a platform upon which you can get influence. (Hence: Campaigning on privacy as the opposition, then taking the opposite stance once you're in and you realise you're not actually in control.)

Now, who knows whether this is true, but it has a ring to it as an anecdote regardless:

&gt;He’s afraid of what happened to Martin Luther King Jr. And I know from a good friend who was there when it happened, that at a small dinner with progressive supporters – after these progressive supporters were banging on Obama before the election, Why don’t you do the things we thought you stood for? Obama turned sharply and said, “Don’t you remember what happened to Martin Luther King Jr.?” 

&gt;That’s a quote, and that’s a very revealing quote.

There were street parties in Lurgan. As far as I'm aware that is in NI. Yep, parties in ROI too. Scotland as well, Wales too, England furthermore, and yep, Argentina - also South Africa, and I think some in Chile too (because of her special friendship with the dictator Pinochet). Is that not the very definition of 'international'?

There were more people partying than those attending her funeral or paying respects - that's for sure.

&gt; (and wtf does that phrase mean exactly? Is that what you use when you can't say majority?)

It means relative to any other prime minister who has died. Usually the death of someone like that is treated with a big '*so what?*' from the populace. Not in Maggies case.

&gt; Interesting that you use two English flatmates to argue 'a massive proportion relatively speaking' - are they also the same age as you, ie too young to have been alive when the person you're slagging was in power?

Does it not speak volumes that those, indeed too young to remember Maggie, have been brought up to hate her by their parents and/or other family members? The hate is that strong.

&gt; And in any case, the disgusting loudmouth 'celebrations' that occurred in places like the Falls Rd after her death are no indication of mainstream public opinion.

false,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"Unfortunatelty, while it's being offered as a good thing, this is a demonstration of why wind power is so bad.

Last Sunday it was 43%.  And what was the percentage on Monday?  Tuesday? Two Sunday's ago?  Was it the same each time?  No, it was wildly different.  What then supplies that 43% when wind power isn't doing so?

The answer, of course, is all those fossil powered (probably gas turbine) stations that wind power is ""replacing"".  You see then that wind power can never replace fossil generation because on the days when the wind doesn't blow, we'll still need the fossil station.

Worse: keeping a fossil power station on standby significantly lowers its efficiency.  Running properly a gas turbine station might be (figures from memory) 95%.  Running on standby and being ramped up and ramped down to suit the fluctuations in the wind, it might be 75% -- the difference in efficiency means that _more_ fossil fuel is burned than would have been if we'd just run it properly the whole time.  That extra fossil fuel burned releases more CO2 than is saved by generating power from wind.  And that means that _more_ CO2 is released because of wind turbines, not less.

The capacity factor for wind turbines is in the 20-30% range -- that is the amount of energy they _actually_ generate over the amount they are rated to generate.  Fossil stations are all above 90%; and likely 98% if their well maintained.  You'll note in every press release about wind farms, they _always_ quote the rated capacity, not the capacity-factor corrected figure.  They do that because the maths simply doesn't make sense when you use the real figures.

Still, at least we're hitting our renewables targets.  That's the main thing.

Now, having goals in terms of technical policies can be difficult, but one can have what are loosely terms ""moral goals"". As in, you can have an idea of the sort of world you want to live in - basically, have *guiding principles* - and policies can be made, adapt, and change in line with that.

Today's great solution becomes tomorrow's big problem. If you're focused on implementation only, that can get troublesome. If you're guided by a ""higher ideal"", then chopping and changing is not, because you are always referencing your vision.

*But - - -* the difficult bit is to articulate the concepts, examine the assumptions. Simple things, such as: from now on, we'll have a four-day week.

1. He strengthened the defence after a season where we scored a lot of goals, and shipped a lot of goals, but somehow managed to miss that we had pace and power up front and signed Lambert and an errant but talented footballer (similar to but very unlike Suarez)
2. He persisted with Gerrard for about 5 games more than the average human being takes to realise that we don't have pace up front to use him in a deep-lying position
3. Regardless, he left Lucas out of the team who, even though he can be poor at times, is the only midfielder who can do all the defensive midfield tasks: make tackles, interceptions, tidy up - and he finally put him back in after several defensively abject displays
4. His substitutions (or lack thereof) are all reactionary - nothing to take control of the game or anticipate its progress
5. Re Borini - what are you playing at Rodgers? If you don't like him, drop him to the reserves. Stop training him with the first team and then leaving him out of the squad on match day when we have no other strikers. Are you waiting for someone to ask you about him? Say something, goddammit.

I'd forgive all this if Rodgers didn't constantly say some genuinely ridiculous shit every 3-4 days. His attempts at humility and man-management is borderline megalomaniacal. It's not noticeable when your players are running amok (99% of our time TV is replays of our beautiful goals rather than of Rodgers talking about our difficulties as if he's not party to or responsible for them) but it's painful now.

I'm right behind the players - we've got what it takes to win games and to play to Rodgers' ""preferred"" style - it just sucks to see the team selection and subs hurting the team dynamic every week. 

You can see he's working hard on some of these youngsters he signed (Markovic no longer looks like a hapless child for example) but sweet baby jesus how many decades does it take to figure out a goddamn transfer policy and team that actually works so that we can be a proper top 4 club again? It's giving me massive ballache thinking about this.

Despite Rodgers being young and talented and capable of building a great passing team, I feel we will eventually sack him (in the next year or two) and replace him with a foreign manager, the sort with stature and continental experience who players will want to play for (like Houllier and Rafa). Sadly, it's the lot of most British managers, but there you go. I know I sound like I hate Rodgers but I really don't - he's steadied the ship massively since he came in but he will outlive his usefulness.

http://www.powertrans.com.au/UserFiles//file//PDFs//EG-4-13.pdf

Page 25.

The Seddon paper looks at a large number of wind farms across Australia, and presents figures for output and efficiency.  He finds that the relative output (actual annual output as a percentage of rated capacity) varies from 22 to 42%, with an average of 33%.  He also finds that where the relative output is less than 32% (that is, give or take a percentage point, about the average) there are no net savings of emissions.

Worse, Professor Hughes found that over the lifetime of a wind turbine, the output can decline by as much as half.  So strictly we would need them to be starting out at 66% capacity factor.  Ouch.

I could talk for thousands of words about state of the art power R&amp;D such as thorium and ""clean"" coal (I know, it's an oxymoron) which the green party conveniently forget about when talking about high-tech energy. You can't praise high-tech renewable while ignoring the advances elsewhere.

Another few thousand about how France is now the power breadbasket of Europe because of their investment in Nuclear and is one reason they are still relevant in Europe instead of suffering a high-tech brain drain.

Fun fact, did you know that French Nuclear power plants allow you to have a cup of tea in the Coronation St ad break? I do hope no Green candidates are putting a brew on after the music starts. They sell us power to handle the spikes.

The French government is laughing their way to the bank while everyone else is umming and ahhing over whether Nuclear power is ethical while they sell it to them anyway, because we need it.

Anyway, as for the Green party,

I applaud their commitment to moving away from fossil fuels (and my company supplies to oil &amp; gas), but without them there is only ONE choice, and it is Nuclear. To ban both is hilariously overselling how much renewable energy provides for the UK.

Have a look at [this graph](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Electricity_Production_in_the_United_Kingdom.svg) and extrapolate over the next 20-30 years. It looks grim because fossil fuels are lowering, and nothing will be making up that budget.

It shows renewable energy use rising, except what it doesn't show is that there is a cap on it. There's only so much renewable energy we can tap into on our little islands. There will be diminishing returns as the renewable energy sector is done tapping into the low hanging fruit, for example a windy hill with cheap land rates and good transport links for construction.

Eventually the costs will be prohibitive, for example to blanket the North Sea in turbines. Except that is what is needed to meet our energy demands.

The only other answer to balance that equation while winding down our fossil fuel use (which I think we can all agree is a good idea) is by getting that power elsewhere, in comes Nuclear.

How about instead of exceptionally costly renewable energy that spreads over a huge area, we build safe nuclear power plants that require less land and stores waste safely? Considering half of the entire Scottish wind ouput can be offset by one double-reactor plant.

Scotland has  2,315 wind turbines. That same energy generation could be covered by 1.5 Nuclear power plants. (and it wouldn't depend on the wind)

I wonder which contributes to more environmental damage?

Renewable energy may one day power the world, but it's not happening in a year that starts  with 20XX. I'd love it if we could become a country that powers itself with cheap renewable sources, then ships our North Sea oil away for mega bucks, but it's not happening for tens of years, possibly even centuries.

He's sticking to his principals when he doesn't have the players available to make it work. Pace upfront would mean opposition either has to track back giving our DM's (or Gerrard last year) and our CB's much more time on the ball or to try and close down leaving space for the likes of Sterling, Sturridge, Suarez to exploit. Without those 2 it's left to Sterling to stretch teams alone which is far too much to ask. Lambert and Balotelli simply do not do what Rodgers wants very well and rather than playing to their strengths it looks to me as if he's still trying to force square pegs into the round holes left vacant by Suarez and Studge. I can understand to some extent as he's confident in his brand of football which reaped rewards last year with the right players.


This brings me to my next thought, how much control does Rodgers really have over transfers? For someone who shipped Carroll out as quickly as he could, why then go and buy fairly similar players in Lambert and Balotelli? He may have said he has the final say but when you're left with Lambert, Sturridge and Borini as your only options is he really going to turn down another striker? He will have desperately wanted Sanchez who is probably the most like for like replacement we could have had for Suarez but apparently geography was the downfall.


I'm pretty sure he wanted Ben Davies before Moreno as well and I can see why, Moreno doesn't look defensively or aerially good enough for a  PL back 4. His Spurs goal aside, I'm not convinced and his recent bench warming leads me to think Rodgers is of the same opinion, he needed a left back, couldn't get first choice, left with second choice.


Same again with Shaqiri, he was allegedly approached before the World Cup and has all the hallmarks of Rodgers only arguably successful signings, Studge and Coutinho. Undervalued by current club with proven quality. Unfortunately we couldn't get Bayern to sell and my guess is that Markovic was the second or even third choice?


We've missed out on plenty others so I won't go on but seeing as we had to reduce the wage bill, are we losing out on the players Rodgers actually wants to fit his system because their wages exceed what the club's statisticians calculate them at?


I get a sense of quiet dissatisfaction from him during his conferences and get a feeling there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than we'll ever know. I have been baffled by some of his tactical set ups but given the nature of his character I'm not surprised he'll stick to his philosophy if only in a vain attempt to prove a point.

Meanwhile, [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_cartoon_pornography_depicting_minors) is where it starts to get strange:

&gt;The legal status of cartoon pornography depicting minors varies from country to country and concerns simulated pornography and child pornography.

&gt;Some analysts have argued whether such cartoon depiction is a ""victimless crime"".

&gt;Laws have been enacted to criminalize ""obscene images of children, no matter how they are made"", for inciting abuse. An argument is the claim that obscene fictional images portray children as sex objects, thereby contributing to child sexual abuse. 

&gt;This argument has been disputed by the fact that there is no scientific basis for that connection, and that restricting sexual expression in drawings or animated games and videos might actually increase the rate of sexual crime by eliminating an outlet for desires that could motivate crime.

&gt; -- [*Wikipedia*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_cartoon_pornography_depicting_minors)

Reminds me of the video nasties argument and the arguments used against video games - none of which have any scientific basis. Of course, that's pretty common, drug classifications being another example.

My better half is a cultural catholic (goes to mass a couple of times a year, doesn't do any other religious stuff except the rituals at weddings/funerals etc, but still considers herself a 'believer') while I'm a secularist. Marriage is on the horizon, but there's a 0% chance I'm getting married in a church (not allowed to in the RC anyway, without applying for permission from the bishop since I'm an infidel) or lying when making promises. 

I'm not sure how that'll turn out, but when it comes to kids it'll feel pretty awkward if they are baptised. The couple of times I've been to those of friends' children has been incredibly awkward, especially when I know they aren't believers themselves. However, any child will not just be mine alone, so I won't have the final say in such matters.

My gf's from a very liberal but still religious catholic family, so the expectation will probably be that any children are baptised. They're wonderful people and I'd rather not disappoint/piss them off. It's just balancing up whether my children would be pissed off or not. I don't imagine any kids we raise will turn out to be bible-bashers, and even though a few ridiculous evangelicals taught at my school and I was sent to Sunday school, it didn't do me too much harm. 

As for schooling, I don't think it'll make a difference if they're baptised or not. We have good state and catholic primaries in the area, so that's not an issue. For seconday schooling my preference would be for them to where my gf went, which is an excellent catholic grammar (which, from all reports, managed to be considerably less religious than my state experience).

That's not true. I'm pretty sure the ones who are against it are not saying it out loud because it wont look good for them (Imagine the scandel if the Greens stood up to this!).

However, the great thing is, both the Greens and UKIP want direct democracy. So, we don't have to rely on them, we could then have a referendum to fix the issue ourselves.

""People just want a show"" is horribly depressing to me, although it may well be the accurate answer.

&gt; Because when you can't feed your family due to welfare cuts while at the same time a portion -- albeit small -- of your wages is sent to buy rich people champagne

So it's a problem with maths? Seriously, even assuming those in dire need of help pay an equal portion of the tax, it's a ludicrously minute amount. Is the problem that people don't get this? What if it was a billionth of a penny? 

What actual effect does the champagne have, is it detrimental? Is it helpful? If it gets two lords to stick about and talk through political matters for another hour over a bottle then you've successfully managed to spend just £8/hour as a wage. If they stick around for an hour and a half then you've just paid them less than minimum wage. 

If I value my time at £5/hour and spent 1 minute reading this article and getting free champagne removed, then it would take *sixteen years* for that effort to pay off in my tax. If you buy a £2 pint, that's equivalent to four hundred years of a rebate. Half a free pint per person on each bicentennial? 

&gt; What part of this do you not understand?

22? Ha! I'm 36, married, both of us employed (me self employed, wife employed). We rent. We're a good few years from buying our first house.

22 is a lot younger than you might think it is. Rent, learn what it's like to look after a house, save hard, and have the security of someone else being there to deal with all the stuff that can go wrong with a house.

Average first time buyer is now 36. There may be a crash coming in the housing market (here's hoping, eh?) but you can't rely on anything like this happening. Don't sweat it. Owning a house means fixing a house, maintaining a house, insuring it, mortgage repayments, life insurance, solicitors, surveys, estate agents and god knows what else... at 22 you don't need to be worrying about all that stuff. Just take advantage of the freedoms of being young.

But save as much as you possibly can and when you are ready, you'll be well ahead of the game. If I'd started saving at 22 I'd probably be ready to buy now.
