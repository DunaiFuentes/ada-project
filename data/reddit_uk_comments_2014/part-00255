&gt;

&gt;""__Dalek__"" is the sixth [episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [first revived series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_1\)) of British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) programme *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, which was first broadcast on 30 April 2005. This episode is the first appearance of the Daleks in the 21st century revival of *Doctor Who*; it also marks the first appearance of [Bruno Langley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Langley) as [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)) [Adam Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Mitchell_(Doctor_Who\)).

&gt;The episode is set in [Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah) in the year 2012, in the underground bunker owned by [Henry van Statten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_villains#Henry_van_Statten), a rich collector of alien artifacts. The Doctor encounters his one living exhibit: a creature called ""the Metaltron"", which the Doctor is horrified to discover is a surviving Dalek. When the Dalek escapes, the Doctor races against time to stop it from getting to the surface and wreaking havoc on humanity.

He was an army man at heart but he never let that ruin his friendship with the Doctor. In fact he eventually taught his daughter that ""Science Leads"", something he learned from an old friend. 

I really believe that his friendship and occasional quarrels with the Second and Third Doctors helped the Doctor to form such an interest and love with the human race.

&gt; This does not work when applied to drawings.

I have to agree. The legal system should be punishing harm not things we find disgusting and the punishment should be proportional to the harm caused. Anything else and you need to make the rather difficult argument that it's ok to criminalise ideas or concepts even where those ideas don't seek to incite other criminal acts. You need to make the argument that it's ok to send someone to prison for expressing an idea (in a drawing) alone and in private - mere possession, which was all he was charged with. Tell David Cameron what his pet 'British values' are he'd probably go on about Magna Carta and a history of liberal philosophy and democratic movements.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"&gt;If he was ""perfect"" for Poch's system, then Poch would play him. I get that many of you like him, but be serious. In the time he's been here, he's hasn't shown the great technical ability to be a starting #10.

It's a leap, but that's literally like saying I bet Juve aren't kicking themselves for getting rid of Henry cuz he played out of position for them. He's shown mediocrity because he's been out of position - yet when he plays AMC, I've seen him do fantastic things. He just doesn't get any consistent gametime there. He's NOT A FUCKING CM. I've seen people say ''our CM's - who do we sell, Dembele, Sandro, Holtby....'' I don't know how many times I need to reiterate myself. Would you say Ozil was medicore if he was forced into a deep CM? Or Mata? Or Kagawa? Or any AMC that has shown their talent at a club arguably better off than ours? 

It's baffling. On one hand you get ''zero end product, never shown anything'' in his career Townsend revered as gods gift on this sub, ''he can still learn at 23!!!!!!'' shoved down my neck, yet Holtby, who is the SAME age apparently has hit his peak and can't learn? Alright then. Most people wanted to keep Townsend despite prices quoted over 10 FUCKING MILLION. What? Holtby is way more talented, it's not even close

&gt;In the time he's been here, he's hasn't shown the great technical ability to be a starting #10.

Have you seen some of his assists? He doesn't get time at AMC to show anything. He just gets thrown in at CM, which he isn't

&gt;Holtby love on this subreddit is the result of fantasy and well-wishing. He simply hasn't shown the ability many of you wish he had.

Fantasy. So his Schalke career was a myth, and never happened - and he certainly didn't do enough to get a call up to the Germany u21's and captain them. Right. How can he show his ability out of position? I've seen him with assists you would cream over in the RARE occurrence he starts as a AMC if it was golden boy Eriksen. 

&gt;Oh and stop comparing his work in the Bundesliga against the completion here

I was comparing the Eredivsie and the Bundesliga. Holtby was doing all this (aka, above), in a much tougher league where Alfonso Alves can score 35 odd goals a season. Also, I don't think you're giving the Bundesliga the credit it deserves - it's a VERY good league and not too dissimilar to ours. And also, in the Bundesliga, he was played is his prefered position. So I'm comparing his work as a consistent, AMC, in a 4-2-3-1 to being forced as a CM. I'm sure you'd be disappointed if we got linked to Draxler, Meyer, Rodriguez at LB and so on because their work in the Bundi means nothing. Right

&gt;Oh and quotes from an article aren't facts.

No, but literally every single thing in the articles are quoting *facts*. 

&gt;What is factual are the things we've seen on the pitch.

Yeah, I remember saying that about Townsend and got shot down. Remember that?

&gt;Holtby hasn't shown himself to be the player you think he is.

He has. He just hasn't shown it because we've completely ruined his career by forcing him into a CM role in a 4-3-3 and then loaning him out to Fulham. I'm willing to bet you if he played 38 games at AMC you would totally change your tune. 

End of the day, Levy is fucking idiotic for selling him purely based on the fact that we have no cover there now. What happens if Eriksen gets injured, or burnt out? Then what? Bring someone else in who isn't integrated into the team and a dressing room presence, someone who lacks the same drive? It's just a stupid move all round and he'll go on to prove everyone wrong because he's gone out of fashion.

But being black out drunk is also no way to make sound decisions, and definitely no way to remember in the morning.

The doctors age bounced around from 450 to 1000 over the course of the classic series with no real chronoly to call it cannon. It's been fairly on track during the NuWho era.
Eight never said his age on screen
War Doctor said he was 400 years younger than eleven
Ten said he was 903 during ""Voyage Of The Damned"" and then 906 just before he regenerated in The End of Time. He also said he was 904 in the 50th.
Eleven is the best judge of time and Eleven seems to have lived longer than anyone. Throughout Series 5 he said he was 907, in The Impossible Astronaut he said he was 909, he then had an almost 200 year farewell tour and his older version in The Wedding of River Song was 1103.
Series 7 he said he was 1200. during the 50th he said he was 1200 and something and couldn't remember if he was making it up or not.
He then stated in The Time Of The Doctor that he had been fighting the Daleks on Trenzalor for 900 years making him 2100 at the time of regeneration.
So Doctors 1 through 10 were 906 years old. 11 was 2100 so 11 lived longer than everyone else combined.

First, we had another villain who was a reflection of part of the Doctor. Is Robin Hood going to be the adventurous, womanizing part (except I have no idea how that would work with Capaldi's character)? Secondly, there was a chalkboard with the equations again. Thirdly, Missy. 

But potentially most importantly, I love Danny already. I just want to give him a big hug! 

Edit: Did anyone else draw some comparisons between this and Journey to the Center of the TARDIS? Like, the inside of the Dalek REALLY reminded me of the inside of the TARDIS. 

Edit2: Wrote these below, but I might as well combine all my thoughts into one post
&gt;This is one of my favorite incarnations of the Daleks. Bronze, ruthless killing machines. Because, they're Daleks. That's the point.

.
&gt;This is maybe the first episode that I have really liked Clara. Some episodes, I hated her. Some episodes, she was alright. But this episode we got to see her as an actual character with personality traits that exist for another reason than just to conveniently move the story from Plot A to Plot B.
But, even more so, I love Danny. He had such a minor part, but we already got a little bit of character development. I'm not sure if I really want a Danny-Clara romance though. I get that it would be different from Rose-Mickey/Amy-Rory because the Doctor is no longer creating a triangle, but do we really NEED to have a romantic aspect?

I'm a bit more meh on the rest of the episode, something just isn't sitting quite right with me.  I kept waiting for Clara to remember that she was a Dalek, or to whip out her Dalek hacking skills.  At this point I'm not even sure she still has normal person computer skills.

I'm really surprised that this Doctor seems so... uncaring.  Giving that one guy false hope right before he got vaporized was particularly mean.  Letting the other soldier sacrifice herself just to scale the Dalek a bit faster isn't something any of the other doctors would have allowed.  10 and 11 thought that everyone was important, every life was worth saving, every death a tragedy... it just seemed like such a fundamental aspect of who the doctor was underneath all of his different faces and personalities.

My guess is Mr. Pink is an escaped Master trying to reform himself.

The Master personality we all know of will come back out again and warp this thought of ""The Doctor didn't save me, he let me die, how many others like me?"" and use those people against him in the future.

true,Gorgash,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Exactly... I used to smoke over a pack a day and I switched to e-cigs a year ago. Haven't smoked a real cigarette since. I still had to *want* to quit and I'm not saying e-cigs are a magical solution, but they definitely made it a lot easier for me to stop smoking. I started noticing improvements in my health immediately... my lungs stopped hurting, my cough went away and I no longer smelled like shit. Not to mention they're ridiculously cheap compared to maintaining a smoking habit.

I'm not going to say e-cigs are healthy, but like you say they're a damn sight healthier than normal cigarettes. I don't know who the fuck is selling them to children (obviously like with actual cigarettes you should be 18+ to buy them) because they're supposed to be for smokers trying to quit/ex-smokers only. Maybe some foolish adults who have never smoked will take up vaping, but meh. That's their choice as adults and compared to drinking copious amounts of alcohol or getting into drugs (as in heroin and all that) I'd say vaping is pretty low on the list of things to give a shit about.

The reason e-cigs worked so well for me is because yes - they do contain nicotine. I wasn't so bothered about having a nicotine addiction as much as I was with having a *smoking* addiction. Nicotine by itself isn't particularly dangerous in low quantities (I've heard it's comparable to caffeine)... it's all the other toxic chemicals you find in cigarettes that give you cancer and other health complications.

Also if you vape too much and too heavily, your lungs will still feel that. E-cigs are brilliant, but I do think it's wiser to try and use them sparingly. It's extremely easy to puff away at an e-cig because it's not like a normal cigarette - it doesn't burn out, it doesn't end until you need to refill the clearomiser or recharge the battery. If anything it may *increase* your nicotine addiction once you switch from normal cigarettes. But I still think it's WELL worth the switch. A nicotine addiction is arguably easier to deal with once you're off the death sticks.

Anybody who actually thinks e-cigs are worse than normal smoking is completely and utterly misled or deluded. As someone who used to be an extremely heavy smoker, e-cigs have probably saved me from getting lung cancer in my 40's or something... they're the best invention for smokers trying to quit in a long, long time.

And that's why the tobacco industry hates them and will no doubt be trying to convince everybody that e-cigs are somehow worse than cigarettes. *shrugs*",0,1409459676,null,0,false,0,ck57b5x,t3_2f0x8w,t1_ck57b5x,t1_ck4u05u,null,1427273778,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Is that not what he did last season when, instead of actually moving to Arsenal, he stayed and scored 31 league goals for us? 

Believe me, I was one of the people who in the summer before last season said; ""Sure, let's sell him off, as long as its not to a club in England and we get a proper transfer fee"" (in those days we were talking at least 50-55 million pounds). 

I'm not trying to have an argument, but rather understand just why you continue to dislike Suarez. You talk as if he handed in a transfer request and actually did leave directly to another English club, something a certain other striker did just a few years ago. Instead he stayed, made amends with his teammates and even said that the continued support of the fanbase was what convinced him to stay, even amongst the many reasons he had for wanting to leave.

Yes, he handed in a transfer request and courted speculation of a move. He's not the first to have done so and he certainly won't be the last. But did he leave after all that? *No, he didn't.* When he finally did leave, there weren't any transfer requests, no trying to force himself out. His dream club came in with a huge bid, and we did, in my opinion, the smart thing by saying yes. 

Hell, literally days ago a Torres video got posted to /r/soccer, and people (including Liverpool fans) weren't even slagging him off, but they were lamenting his fall. Even today people talk about how fondly they remember him, that he was the reason they support Liverpool and were gutted when he left. 

*That* is how Suarez will be remembered, and absolutely in a much more positive light considering the fact that he left after an amazing season that he contributed hugely to (unlike Torres who was arguably on the decline). Even now he still supports us.

I also only noticed that you mentioned that LFC ""made [Suarez] great"", fact is that that isn't true, that distinction arguably belongs to Ajax, a club from which he left as a hero. Suarez nearly brought up a league title, and in the end, he rewarded our faith with results. He shed tears when we drew against Palace, and you're comparing him to Owen. We all agree that Owen did the worst thing possible by playing for United, and what's worse is that unlike Suarez, Liverpool Football Club was actually what made Owen great since he came up from the youth system. Suarez didn't actually do what Owen or Torres did, so why are you trying to put him in that ""boat""?",0,1409461473,null,0,false,0,ck57wis,t3_2f00eu,t1_ck57wis,t1_ck503dq,null,1427273502,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Hirshologist,flair8,,"&gt;It's a leap, but that's literally like saying I bet Juve aren't kicking themselves for getting rid of Henry cuz he played out of position for them. He's shown mediocrity because he's been out of position

No, not at all.  Remember the word I used, ""techincally""  This isn't about where playing CM or where else on the pitch.  It's just about his techincal ability.  When it comes to dribbing, passing, shooting, pace, and touch, he's just not quite good enough for starting role on a top 4 team or at least a team with top 4 aspirations.  That's why many of us don't rate him highly and neither have 3 managers at Tottenham, or many other people at the top clubs in Europe.  

Also, this is really the first year he's played extensive time at CM.  For the past year and half over here and at Fulham, he's played mostly an AMC role.  I'm not sure where you're getting we're always playing him out of position.  It's more like we tried him as a #10 and he wasn't completely impressive, so we ended up getting Eriksen.

Look at some of the stuff Eriksen does with his feet.  There is a wide gap in skill between the two of them.  It's very apparent when you watch him play.  Holtby's skill is his amazing ability to run around a lot, but he just doesn't have the special-ness and artistry that you really want from a #10.  

&gt;It's baffling. On one hand you get ''zero end product, never shown anything'' in his career Townsend revered as gods gift on this sub, ''he can still learn at 23!!!!!!'' shoved down my neck

I don't revere him as a god and honestly, I would rather see Andros come off the bench just as much as I want to see Holtby come of the bench.  However, Townsend has shown some flashes here and there.  For a winger, he has great speed, he gets power into his crosses and shots.  Sure, he hasn't shown much end product yet, but he doesn't seem far off from putting it all together and becoming a major threat for our side.   If Andros can just get his shots to stay a little lower, I think he'll be amazing.  Remember, Bale had that same problem early on.  He would take shots and miss completely and then it finally started to click.  I don't know if it will ever happen with Andros, but the potentional is certainly there. 

On the other hand, Holtby is who he is.  He's not going to become faster and I don't see him become any better techincally.  He's not a tweak or two away from become a dangerous player.  At this point, he is who he is and that's not good enough to be a starter on Spurs.  

&gt;Fantasy. So his Schalke career was a myth, and never happened - and he certainly didn't do enough to get a call up to the Germany u21's and captain them. 

I don't see what that has to do with anything.  So what if he played well at Schalke?  The level of competition is signifanctly lower than the EPL.  (IT IS!!)  Just because he played well at a lower club, doesn't mean he's going to continue to succeed at a bigger one.  And honestly, for as ""great"" as you think he was at Schalke, don't you find it odd that the best he could do after them was come to us on what was basically a free transfer?

&gt;I was comparing the Eredivsie and the Bundesliga. 

I'm not sure what your point is there.  If this is about how he compares to Eriksen, dude, just watch Spurs games.  I honestly never saw Eriksen play at AJAX and I don't honestly care.  I've seen him play for Spurs and I've seen Holtby play for Spurs.  There is no comparison between the two.  Eriksen is far and away the better player.   

&gt;No, but literally every single thing in the articles are quoting facts.

Not quite.  There were stats, sure, but most of what you posted had there share of opinion.  Regardless, it's again irrelevant.  What's the point of looking at a scouting report when you've already seem him in Lilywhite.

&gt;End of the day, Levy is fucking idiotic for selling him purely based on the fact that we have no cover there now. What happens if Eriksen gets injured, or burnt out?

I completely agree with that.  I'd rather keep Holtby here as backup.  My instinct is that the rumors of Holtby leaving are coming from his camp.  I don't think the Spurs want to get rid of him.  I think it's more he wants to leave to have a starting role.  I really want him to stay.  His energy off the bench is an incredible asset.

The way in which race is dealt with in these (to my mind) overly fuzzy and worryingly seems to dismiss race as a factor rather too easily. 

The Rotherham report (http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham) discusses race a lot more frankly and points out worries of investigators of seeming racist which is disturbing. Sadly it is also suggested that, as a result, abuse of Pakistani girls and women was being under reported and poorly dealt with for the fear of appearing racist. 

The summary of the Childrens Commissioner http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/force_download.php?fp=%2Fclient_assets%2Fcp%2Fpublication%2F743%2FIf_only_someone_had_listened_Office_of_the_Childrens_Commissioners_Inquiry_into_Child_Sexual_Exploitation_in_Gangs_and_Groups.pdf is long and gives an idea of the scope of intervention that is required but does not seem to mention race as a factor at all.

&gt;__Joseph Carey Merrick__ (5 August 1862 – 11 April 1890), sometimes incorrectly referred to as __John Merrick__, was an English man with severe deformities who was exhibited as a [human curiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_show) named the __Elephant Man__. He became well known in London society after he went to live at the [London Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital). Merrick was born in [Leicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester), [Leicestershire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire) and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life. His skin appeared thick and lumpy, he developed an enlargement of his lips, and a bony lump grew on his forehead. One of his arms and both feet became enlarged and at some point during his childhood he fell and damaged his hip, resulting in permanent lameness. When he was 10, his mother died and his father soon remarried. Merrick left school at 13, and had difficulty finding employment. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home. In late 1879, aged 17, Merrick entered the Leicester Union [Workhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workhouse).

This seems to be the yes campaigns current strategy - which makes sense as the NHS is something people are concerned about.

This is Better Together's response.

From what I've read I can't identify if there's anything special about NHS funding in Scotland that is under threat or if this is purely down to how much funding Scotland gets in total.

true,RedditMcRedditor,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt; I don't get why there is such strong opposition to them as compared to other nicotine substitutes such as patches or gum.

Patches and gum are heavily regulated and tested to make sure they're safe. They also don't interact in any way with people who arent using them. Nobody complains about passive chewing.

Ecigs - and the liquids used in them - are often untested and regulated. And the vapour exhaled still affects others similar to second hand smoke. Just because it's not as bad as second hand smoke doesn't mean it should get a free pass.

Exhaled Ecigs vapour still contains small amounts of nicotine. About 1/20th of standard fags according to testing, but it's still there. The flavoured varieties leave a lingering smell on clothes like traditional fags. And the exhaled vapour sets off fire alarms in enclosed spaces.

The solution to this is simple. Regulate and test the vapourisers and liquids being sold to make sure they're safe. And don't allow their use in enclosed spaces.

I would love for them to be prescribed to help people get off traditional fags, just like patches and gum, once they've been tested and proven safe.

true,DrBorisGobshite,lfc68,,"I don't why you have to keep trying to put words in my mouth. Again, we go back to the original topic of conversation, legendary status. I don't dislike Suarez at all, he was a fantastic player for us but he will not be held in as high esteem as he could have been because of his actions whilst at the club. He will not go down as a club legend like Agger.

You need to take off your rose tinted glasses and go have another look at last Summer. Suarez didn't stay because he wanted to stay, he was told he was staying and we told Arsenal to fuck off. If we had accepted that stupid £40 plus £1 bid from Arsenal like we were supposed to what do you think Suarez would have done? Do you think he would have said 'sorry Arsene, Liverpool have had a word with me and i'm going to stay at Anfield'? Not a chance. He would have been of in a shot. The only reason Suarez was still a Liverpool player last year was because we forced him to stay. As for repaying us on the pitch, Suarez always plays at 100% and he had a World Cup to play for, he was hardly going to sit around and sulk (not that i'm demeaning his contribution last season).

As for this season, he didn't need to force himself out because we were happy to let him go. Talks with Barca were started months ago and the incident with Chiellini at the World Cup made it an even easier decision. Fact is if he could keep his teeth to himself we could have got more money for him. He is much better than Bale, just come off his best season ever and yet Bale went for more money.

Finally, LFC did make Suarez great. When he joined Liverpool who else was after him? Spurs. They were our only competition for his signature. If he was 'great' at Ajax why were Barca not after him then? Being a top scorer in the Eredivisie does not make you a great player. Look at  Afonso Alves, Mateja Kezman or Bas Dost, all players with fantastic records in the Eredivisie but they aren't considered 'greats'. To be considered great you have to perform at the highest level, the Eredivisie is not the highest level but the Premier League is. We bought him, despite his recent disciplinary issues, and gave him the platform to perform at the highest stage. When we bought Suarez he was a good player from the Dutch League, when he left us he was considered one of the best strikers in the World. So yes, we did make Suarez great.",0,1409470728,null,0,false,0,ck5ab0x,t3_2f00eu,t1_ck5ab0x,t1_ck57wis,null,1427272380,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,docadoca,null,null,"Actual answer: the audience responded badly to them, so they quickly went back to the old designs.

In-universe answer: they're still around as a different 'branch' of the Daleks. Their fate was explained more in, weirdly, the Doctor Who experience, an interactive attraction that used to be in London and then Cardiff (I think it's closed now as it was focused on the 11th Doctor). You basically walked through a number of environments with a group of people (like Starship UK, the Tardis, a Dalek spaceship), while a story was going on with the 11th Doctor getting trapped in a second pandorica again. Matt Smith talks to you through various tv screens throughout the experience (and the Doctor even jokes about the laziness of the plot), and towards the end you and your group get abducted in a Dalek ship (the multi-coloured Daleks). While they're getting ready to exterminate you they get attacked by the 'gold' Daleks, and you escape in the middle of a Dalek civil war. Basically, the Gold Daleks see the multicoloured daleks as rebels, and the coloured Daleks see the gold Daleks as less pure. 

The Doctor Who Experience was surprisingly fun. I hope the BBC releases a full high quality walkthrough video of it at some point, because Matt Smith has some very funny moments in it. It was also pretty great to stand next to full-size animatronic Daleks doing their thing.

true,HugePilchard,null,null,"I'm going to speak out in favour of apprenticeships here. 

Yes, the wage is poor. But then again, if you went into further education the wage is poor (or non-existent) for that, too. That said, some of the larger companies will actually pay a reasonable wage - OK, it won't be megabucks but it's certainly more than the minimum wage for an apprentice. In some cases you could be looking at around £12,000pa, when the minimum wage for an apprentice comes out around £4,300pa, or £10,000pa for an 18-21 year old in regular employment. There are often set points at which your pay is reviewed, so subject to performing as expected, you can expect to earn a few thousand more at the end of your first year, and then another rise at the end of your apprenticeship when you enter into the company's main workforce.

Don't dismiss your own abilities too early. Aptitude and willingness to learn are more important than actual skills. And don't think that IT and hospitality are your only choices - there's plenty more places to look if you don't think you can do IT.

My previous and my current employers are large technology companies with apprenticeship programmes (in technology and non-technology related fields), and the programmes are well structured, pay reasonably well, and are designed to get us fresh blood with the exact skills we want, rather than just being a source of cheap labour. At my last job, I worked alongside people who were apprentices straight from school 20-30 years ago, and are still with that company now in quite senior roles.

I don't like to talk about who I actually work for publicly, but OP - if you PM me I'll give you links to my current and former employers schemes, and any other similar ones that spring to mind.",0,1409471557,null,0,1409472794,0,ck5ah09,t3_2f0rhj,t1_ck5ah09,t3_2f0rhj,null,1427272304,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

On another note, the original theme was sort of produced by traditional  instruments for the time period, but most of it was not. 

&gt; Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators which were used for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. The main, pulsing bassline rhythm was created from a recording of a single plucked string, played over and over again in different patterns created by splicing copies of the sound, with different pitches and notes achieved by playing the sample in different speeds. The swooping melody and lower bassline layer were created by manually adjusting the pitch of oscillator banks to a carefully timed pattern. The non-swooping parts of the melody were created by playing a keyboard attached to the oscillator banks. The rhythmic hissing sounds, ""bubbles"" and ""clouds"", were created by cutting tape recordings of filtered white noise.

The Glaswegian (Dr) and Northern Irish (Uncle) accents can be a little harder for somebody like me but Clara should be a breeze.  The fact that I had most problems understanding Clara suggests to me that this is a sound issue rather than an accent issue.  

I watched episode one on my TV as it was broadcast by the BBC and episode 2 via a download from BBC iPlayer and found issues with both, so it doesn't seem to be the medium either.  That's not enough evidence of course, but it is not like it was okay on TV but poor on download or vice versa.

It presents two arguments.

1) A Yes vote will send house prices down

2) A No vote will send house prices up

It says that the uncertainty of iScotland's fiscal position will cause people to be cautious about buying Scottish property. There's something in this, but Scottish house prices are not in my view overinflated. I think it's reasonable to say that an independent Scotland would give lenders pause on Scottish mortgages - higher rates or tighter LTV requirements for example. I work in the industry and this is reasonable.

The interesting thing he's saying is that house prices in Scotland are already depressed because of the threat of the referendum. 

It depends on what you determine Scottish house prices to be like. Are they like England on average? If so they're not as high as they should be and a no vote will put them up.

If they're like the north of England then they're priced right and are not going to get much of a bump from independence.

Right now though Scottish house prices are performing worse than any other area of the UK and it seems rational to point at the referendum. ",0,1409476175,null,0,false,0,ck5baxn,t3_2f2lkq,t1_ck5baxn,t3_2f2lkq,null,1427271915,4,false,scottishpolitics,t5_2u66o,4

But partly since this is dragging out and also since we don't need to be getting in such a row about how we feel about a player leaving (who isn't even the subject of this post) from the club we both support, I'm concede that we can agree to disagree since after all, all this is about is that we stand on opposite ends when it comes to how we feel about Suarez's departure. 

For me, all the words that come around during the transfer window mean very little. It's hard what to take as fact and what as fiction, especially in this day when it seems like a top player must be linked to a team because his family member/national teammate/wife/dog says so. Who knows really **why** Suarez stayed, because the hierarchy chose to ignore the bid that triggered the release clause or what. For the same reason that they were dodgily able to ignore this, if Suarez really wanted to, I think he still could have left because, and John Henry himself admitted this, I believe, that ""contracts don't really matter a lot in football"". 

I suppose I'd like to think that Suarez had a change of heart, and/or that the alleged ""You're too good for Arsenal"" conversation that Stevie had with Suarez took place and actually meant something in the grand scheme of things:
&gt; I just thought for his own sake, to get respect of the Liverpool fans, he had to give us at least one year. A lot of people might still think he should have given us one more, but my big dream was to play for Liverpool, and the foreign players’ big dream is to play for Real Madrid or Barcelona, that’s a fact. - Gerrard

But whether or not you call him a legend (which I don't, as I say), he's written himself into the history of the club and indeed the league itself with what he's accomplished here, the numbers do not dispute that. 

And as far as the last point about making Suarez great, I guess we have different definitions of what that phrase means. My understanding of this is that you meant to say that we ""made"" Suarez in the same way that United (or Fergie) ""made"" Ronaldo. If this is what you mean, I disagree, at least in part. There's no doubt that Suarez has reached the greatest height of his career so far with us, but to say that his time spent here is the reason why he is such a good player is not something I believe in, actually.

... funny story - even that supposed downside of nicotine may be more the fault of tobacco as a whole:

&gt; Nicotine ... has, by itself, weak reinforcing properties. It is known that ... substances, other than nicotine, present in tobacco smoke have MAO-inhibitory activities. Here, we report that inhibition of MAO dramatically and specifically increases the motivation to self-administer nicotine

Anecdotally, I went through something very much like ""quitter's rage"" when I was switching to ecigs, so I was surely experiencing withdrawal from *something* -- and I now find it much less unpleasant to go without for a few hours than I did when smoking tobacco. So that study gels with my personal experiences.

""Time after time"" by Stephen Moffat

The Doctor and Clara wake up in the T.A.R.D.I.S. They have travelled to modern day Earth to get something mundane like bagels. They have parked in the middle of the road. Clara has a go at the Doctor for not being able to drive the T.A.R.D.I.S (lol) and he says something sciency about the last episode like it needs to recharge it's hadron cells after getting shot by the positron field emission ray from the last episode. On the way to the bagel shop they see a Buddhist girl in a wheelchair. She is watching them knowingly from across the street but they just continue. There is also a man in dark clothes on the other side of the road watching. Clara says she just felt deja-vu. 

On the way back from the bagel shop they notice that there is now a crowd around the T.A.R.D.I.S. A young boy has been hit by a car that swerved around the T.A.R.D.I.S, and he is now lying in the road dying. The Doctor runs over and starts yelling that he is a Doctor (like in the show name) and he tries to help the boy. An angry woman complains loudly about whoever left the box there being a fool. The Doctor realises that it is his fault as the boy dies. The little Buddhist girl is still watching from the other side of the road as well as the man in dark clothes. The Doctor is distraught and gets into the T.A.R.D.I.S. Clara explains it was an accident but the Doctor is still speechless and goes to bed. Clara goes too. 

The Doctor and Clara wake up in the T.A.R.D.I.S. Clara starts to get up but the Doctor waking up is different. He sniffs the air and says that something is wrong. As they wake up and go outside they realise it is the same day again slowly. ""But how is that possible Doctor?"", moans Clara. ""Timey Wimey"", says the Doctor. ""But I shouldn't be crossing my own time stream! This is not right"". They try to move the T.A.R.D.I.S but it will not open coz fixing. Cue days and days of repeating the day trying to save the little boy but always failing because he just dies in other ways. Little Buddhist girl and dark clothes man are always watching. 

Eventually the Doctor starts to go mad. Clara talks to Buddhist girl who explains that life is about reincarnation and cycles and stuff. Clara understands. She goes to the Doctor and says some nice stuff like ""you have to learn to accept"" and ""you can't change everything"". The Doctor understands and realises that it is not a temporal loop but rather the positron cannon (or something) had actually affected him as well as the T.A.R.D.I.S and personified his guilt and responisbility into human form (the man in dark clothes). The Doctor finally approaches his guilt and explains that he now understands he can't control everything. The dark clothed man smiles and says that that was what the Doctor needed to realise. He disappears. As the doctor turns to go back to the T.A.R.D.I.S he crashes into the little boy and stops the car from hitting him. The little boy is scared but says thank you and his mother collects him. For whatever reason the little boy is safe now. The Doctor and Clara get into the T.A.R.D.I.S for the next adventure and say a joke. The Doctor sees a reflection of the dark suited man nodding.

He hasn't had a great start to the season in the CAM position, and I think his speciality is drifting into pockets of space unexpectedly.  In the middle of the pitch in the EPL, it's often a pretty crowded space, particularly without two strikers pulling two CBs in opposite directions.

His tendency on the left is always to be mobile and come inside anyway, and it creates a problem for opposition players because they're not sure whether to send a wide man inside to follow him, or have a CDM pick him up once he arrives.  That confusion is perfect for him, and arguably all of his best performances for us at the end of last year came when he was positioned on the left.

Lamela, Chadli and potentially Holtby (if he's staying) and Paulinho can play at CAM, and in any case, I fully expect a fluid three in that part of the pitch anyway, making their ostensible positions a little less important anyway.

People have been sent to prison for decades. Right now as I type this on BBC1 there is a panel debating about this exact issue and discussing in rather frank terms whether this is an issue with multiculturalism.

Who is walking on egg shells? Name names.

&gt; It has a duty towards its citizens

Yes, which is why police officers are arresting the criminals involved, the girls are receiving counselling and support, the CPS is charging the perpetrators and bringing about a trial, the courts are convicting them and they are going to prison for sentences in the 20+ year region. 

What has not happened once this has been discovered that you think should?

&gt; and thus needs to stamp out and severely punish those carrying out draconian practices in the name of tradition or religion. 

You are aware that has been happening, yes? 

Decades-long prison sentences are being passed down. Some of these guys would have got shorter sentences for murdering the girls instead of raping them. 

I'm not being flippant, the courts are really stamping on these guys. Some of them will die in prison. How much more punishment would you like? If you mention capital or corporal punishment, well, that's another debate.

&gt; Being a member of a country means adhering to their rules and laws, but not needing to lose their roots and heritage. If they want to ignore this and bring in their laws and traditions that harm others then they should be punished 

But... they *are* being punished. What *exactly* is it that you are angry with?

&gt; or deported.

Eh, what now? You do know these individuals are British citizens, right? Where are they meant to be ""deported"" to? 

To suggest their deportation is as ridiculous as large swathes of the World putting their convicted citizens on planes to Europe because they happen to be white Christians, and you know ""they must come from over there"". 

Do you think every white Brazilian citizen that is convicted of a serious crime should be sent to a country they've never visited before that happens to be mostly white, because in Brazil whites are an ethnic minority?

That one word suggests your entire rant is driven by racism and ignorance - you have assumed that because they are not white, that they are Muslim, that they are ""foreign"". 

You have undermined any point you were attempting to make.

&gt; Such actions should not be tolerated. Lives should not be endangered or sacrificed in the name of multiculturalism.

They're not being tolerated, lives are not being endangered or sacrificed any more. The fact people are going to prison, there are calls for resignations, etc. means what you would like to happen, *actually is happening*. There is no conspiracy from any group or individual today to prevent this. There is a suggestion that in the past there was, and those people are going to be investigated and dealt with appropriately.

The NHS is being used as a particular example of what might happen if there is a squeeze, although it's slightly disingenuous to relate NHS Scotland directly to NHS England spend at a time when its budget isn't shrinking. However, I think its reasonable to assume that to be a longer term goal of privatisation in NHS England given that it's no longer protected as a universal service.

However, the real issue highlighted by this is a problem with the current devolved settlement: The difficulty when you have a government in Westminster that ideologically wants to shrink state, and one in Holyrood that wants to maintain or expand it.

1) **Who makes the sausage?**

If you do a bit of research and look at *some* of the profiles posting here in united kingdom, its quite obvious that there is a coordinated campaign underway here to highlight failings of the muslim community. 

I don't know who is behind it, but some have alluded to some of the more nefarious 'far left nationalist' groups, who are sometimes referred to as neo-nazis, or 'far right' by economically illiterate commentators. However we don't really know without getting forensic, which I don't think is necessary as its quite transparent.

If the issue was abuse, there would be just as many posts about institutionalised paedophilia in Westminster, by policy makers. Instead we are repeatedly focused on one specific corner of the sess-pool that has infected British society.    

There is undoubtedly a problem in the Pakistani community that needs addressing. However, as the old Polish saying goes - A broken clock is still correct twice a day.

By this I mean, the liberal elite have clearly failed on this issue, and its failings have lead to the perpetuated abuse and suffering of thousands of victims. However, being right on one issue does not justify a world view. If it wasn't pakistani child abuse now it would be Africans causing ebola by eating bush meat in South London, or Polish eating swans and stealing jobs, or the old favourite - Ze Juden. 

Just keep an eye on who makes the sausage folks. One swallow doesn't make a summer. 

2) **Child abuse as a whole is THE issue**

We have all seen the fall out from Jim'll Fix It' Savile. 

His activity was covered up at all levels under strict guidance from the executive class in the media, law enforcement and politics. One could even insinuate that his royal connections deserve scrutiny, especially after recent revelations about some of the royal aides.

We also know that there is a paedophile problem in Westminster too. 

Current front bench politicians have worked in organisations which gave credence to efforts to normalise paedophilia. Thatchers cabinet is purported to have been rife with paedophiles. Blair supposedly had to hush up one of his ministers connections to a Paedophile ring emanating from a Lambeth Care Home. Ex PM's have been posthumously accused, as have still active ex Ministers, and other deceased ' big names'. 

My point is that the fish rots from the head down, and while we are told that political correctness and fear of being abused of racism were the reasons for holding back investigations into child abuse, I think its much deeper than that.

I suspect that its probably much likelier that for a high level culture of systematic and institutionalised abuse to flourish and remain protected - any investigation into any form of organised paedophila would have to be suppressed. 

Organisation implies conspiracy, which absolutely shits people up. Its much more comforting for the public to pin their fears on isolated wierdos - in dirty anoraks, carrying around old newspapers and penny sweets in tesco bags. The public is like a monkey with a machine gun. If we start investigating muslim paedo gangs and find local council collusion, then it could move to Westminster. This is why I think there was a culture of hushing things up, and while racism allegations, or fear of them, certainly played a role, I suspect thats just being used as a veil now.

Now the cat is out the bag, so all bets are off.

3) **The Pakistani community** 

Undoubtedly it need to sort their shit out, in terms of religious extremism, attitudes to women, and sexual abuse. 

Attitudes and practices in rural tribal regions are not acceptable anywhere, let alone here. 

However, the more boring truth is that the vast majority of British Pakistanis are respectable, honest, and hardworking people. Do they need to stand up to some shit in their collective community - Ab-so-fucking-lutely. but lets not be stupid enough to tar a whole community.

Doing that is exactly what makes the silent and respectable majority, remain silent and unable to speak out.

Blaming all British Pakistani's is like accusing all British tourists of being yobs. 


TLDR:

We are in the midst of a huge institutionalised paedophile scandal, involving people at the highest echelons of society. This level of institutionalised abuse, and its operational network into care homes is most likely the reason for not investigating long term abuse, because of the potential pandoras box effect - not some wishy washy 'racism' crap.

One un-intended effect of suppressing this type of abuse, is that it doesn't go unnoticed by the day to day man on the street, and it is actually quite likely that groups like the EDL would not exist if there had been proper investigations and prosecutions fro Day 1.

I agree that Eriksen has looked good out wide at times (particular his crossing) but if our QPR performance was anything to go by, he will spend plenty of time out there as Chadli and Lamela come inside to get time on the ball and search for goals.

I see. So i shall go and snap branches from trees and tell people i have shit on a stick, because there is a potential that i could indeed put shit on the end of my stick even though it is just a stick!  
  
Vapourizers/e-cigarettes should be hailed as the biggest revolution in health since anti biotics. The potential at saving lives is incredible. I personally quit 10 years of 10 a day smoking only 2 days into getting my first ecig. I've gone over a year since, and i feel healthier than ever compared to when i was smoking. 
  
The one thing i agree, is that they should be distanced from the term ""cigarettes"". Vape pen, vapourizer, puffer, or whatever you wanna call it it doesn't matter, but we need distinction from tobacco/combustion products as they are very different in terms of the harm smoking causes. The eliquid/juice in a vapourizer is nothing more than what you find in a scented fog machine with a very small diluted amount of nicotine. The method of creating vapour, or the illusion of smoke is identical to what you might find in a common night club / music venue.  
  
I also want to say that the argument against ""flavour"" attracting kids is absolute rubbish. The main reason why these are great quitting aids/alternatives is that you can find the flavour that makes your mouth water, giving encouragement to prefer vaping over smoking. Who's to say that once we all reach adulthood (18/21) that we aren't allowed chocolate on our digestive biscuits or that we aren't allowed to put sugar in a cup of tea. Adults like flavours too. You'd think half of these people arguing it attracts children had turned 18, and painted all their belongings black/white and ate nothing but mud ever since.",0,1409479409,null,0,1409479728,0,ck5bti1,t3_2f0x8w,t1_ck5bti1,t3_2f0x8w,null,1427271663,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

But Capaldi is so smooth when he moves, very fluid, almost cat-like. The little flourish when he first shows off his new look at the end of *Deep Breath* is so cool.

true,p7r,uk,United Kingdom,"I am no expert, but I have taken an interest in the numerous child exploitation cases, because it seems to that most of the failings are to do with powerful people not realising they are powerful, and vulnerable people not being considered vulnerable by those with power.

As an exercise in human failings within post-war British bureaucracy it is like this zenith of failure. As somebody interested in management, I find it bafflingly compelling, and utterly horrific. This affected real people in terrible ways.

The media have done a very poor job of providing a narrative as to what happened, why, and what can be done to fix it. You need to dig deeper to get a substantial answer to that question.

As it happens, [an independent report has been published that deals with Rotherham specifically](http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham) in the context of Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE from hereon), which is why these stories are now everywhere.

The author Alexis Jay, recommends:

* Better risk assessments for each child who is within the care of social services, and for senior managers to be aware of the contents of those assessments
* Currently a child's risk is reduced down to a number. She is sceptical that this provides sufficient information for various people to be aware of the true risks they are vulnerable to and this numeric tool ""needs review""
* There should be better - and specifically more accountable - strategies to specifically address CSE within local authorities adopted by council leaders and managers
* Potential victims of CSE who have not yet been identified should be contacted
* In order to stop kids slipping through the gaps, a team specifically formed to protect from CSE should be formed in each borough and there should be a single manager who addresses the issue directly (prevents the ""it's somebody else's problem"" effect)
* Better support for the children who are victims is urgently needed
* ""The issue of race should be tackled as an absolute priority if it is a significant factor in the criminal activity of organised child sexual abuse in the Borough.""

At this point you might say ""wait, that's great once it's discovered a child might be vulnerable and a victim, but how do you actually prevent it in the first place?"". Well, she also points out the existing laws that are in place that do not seem to be being used very well.

The Child Abduction Act makes it illegal to remove a child from those who have legal control of the child. It does not need a complaint from the victim for the perpetrator to be arrested and prosecuted. An individual may be served with a warning notice prior to arrest if they are interacting with a child they have absolutely no business in interacting with.

She points out that the police had historically viewed the victims of CSE as perpetrators, not victims - they were being treated the same way adult prostitutes would be dealt with. This was clearly nonsense because they were under the age of consent. That needs to change, and urgently.

""One of the first successful CSE criminal prosecutions to be taken was in Leeds in 1997, when two men were convicted, although twenty men were investigated. Since that date there have been over 20 such court cases and a number of men convicted of offences relating to CSE activity"", which suggests that at least reactive investigations after the fact are succeeding in bringing perpetrators to justice. There is an example she cites where the jury could not come to a verdict and the suspects who were believed to have habitually raped a girl, abducted and then murdered her could not be convicted. It's a depressing piece of narrative in all this.

She suggests that the Crime and Disorder Act has been misinterpreted by many individuals in local authorities, and that many seem unaware that the Data Protection Act does not prohibit sharing of an individuals' data if the purpose is the detection or prevention of crime within the context of the CDA. In other words, too many paper-pushers who could have acted did not because they were concerned about breaking the DPA.

In fact, she has suggested in one case that a parent who went to the police with her daughter's phone which seemed to have the contact details of 125 abusers (it is easy to infer she had effectively been used as an underage prostitute, but it's not explicitly stated, so I don't know the details), that the parent was then told by the police that they could not proceed because it would infringe on the daughter's rights.

This is such an absurd reading of the law as it relates to ""age of consent"", I sincerely hope the officers involved in their management all lose their pensions for that.

There are also many specific ""inter-agency guidance steps"" published in 2008 and 2010 that have yet to be realised or put in place. Depressingly she points out multiple established systems, processes and laws that exist to protect children that many local authorities have not put into practice.

She also goes into numerous examples in other places where these lapses have led to people escaping justice, children being murdered or ""going missing"", etc.

Finally, she recaps the recommendations of numerous previous reports. There are 52 of them.

Now, at this point you might go ""wait, what about multiculturalism, what about the fact this seems to be a specific problem with Muslim men?"".

That's not insignificant, but it is a bit of trap. The only reason why it has been pointed out these investigations have had a cultural/race element to them, is because to not do so would cause the right-wing to accuse them of a conspiracy.

These exact issues were also a factor in Jimmy Saville having free reign, amongst others. They were also factors in the Catholic Nazareth homes, the Haut de la Garenne children's home in Jersey, the Isle of Wight case, etc. There is growing concern about the goings-on at the Elm House guest house in London and numerous senior ministers - it is widely expected that it was vulnerable children involved that social services should have protected.

In short, all of this could be prevented with the police and local authorities protecting vulnerable children and if they do that, it doesn't matter what some Imams are spouting about how they need to be punished or whether TV celebrities, pop stars or government ministers fancy them.

Vulnerable children are vulnerable. They need better protection. That's the answer.",0,1409480342,null,0,false,0,ck5byoz,t3_2f13b9,t1_ck5byoz,t1_ck53niu,null,1427271596,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"I've had NHS doctors threaten us with arrest, removal of our child *and removal of our unborn child at birth* because a Nerologist had never heard of [Alagille Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alagille_syndrome) and asserted that our son's brain bleed could only have happened from us shaking him - despite the bleed being bad enough that we'd have had to break his arms and ribs (which, of course, we hadn't, but they still did several X-Rays because, y'know, one X-Ray isn't good enough). She even went to other Neurologists (who also knew nothing about Alagille's) to confirm that she *must* be right rather than do any research.

This led to our being kept in hospital for months while they did their best to 'prove' we'd damaged him, and all investigation into *what actually caused the bleed* was stopped. As a parent, this is just about the worst situation I could have imagined. We weren't notified of meetings, and were ignored by nurses who assumed we 'must have' battered our child. This went on for *months* - at which point I asked how, if we really had been abusive parents, we hadn't abused him since 'Ah, well you might have stopped now' - bear in mind that our son (six months old at this point) had been under observation by a healthcare professional every few days since birth because of Alagille's, making that statement a bit silly if we'd been so enraged with our child (or whatever) that we'd been beating/ shaking him anyway. I have many more no-win examples like this - in short, if I got angry, I must be abusive, and if I wasn't, I must be neglectful - basically anything that would lead to us being labelled as abusive parents. they even offered to stop the nonsense if we'd just admit that we might have shaken him - which we refused to do as a) it was obviously not true and b) we *wanted to know what what wrong with him*.

During this time on remand, in a woefully understaffed and undercleaned ward he got MRSA, and eventually had to had part of his skull removed due to infection (which again, could only have come from the ward - my Wife and her mother are both nurses, so we were/ are all well aware of infection control) - the ward was closed a few weeks after we left. The extra sting was that he had the skull removed at another more local hospital...where he then got chicken pox.

Once we realised that we were really going to have to do the medical legwork ourselves, we had to get a lawyer to force the hospital to release his notes - upon which they were edited to cover the missed fluids he'd not been given (any anything else we might have gone after the hospital for, which the GMC highlighted when we made a complaint). What was crazy was how the Liver team *knew* his bleed had come from AGS, but were overridden by the Neurologists based on nothing more than ignorance and arrogance. I eventually had signs up around his cot saying 'WE DO NOT BATTER OUR SON, CAN WE PLEASE TAKE HIM HOME'.

So next time someone in a thread insists they'd be more inclined to believe his NHS doctors, remember that there are far more factors at play ( oh and yes, our Neurologist dismissed our internet research, which we found on the, er, BMJ website) - the only person truly interested in *just* your childs' health is *you*.

I've given a short, non-linear account here, but any questions, feel free to ask - we kept a daily diary of over a hundred pages.

TL, DR; Blindly relying on a doctor to diagnose a rare illness when they'd prefer to have you arrested is not always the best option.

Adebayor is the complete centre forward. He possesses pace, strength, height, shooting, heading and passing ability. When he is allowed to play with complete freedom is is un-markable by most limited centre-halfs in the English game. He will drift into wide areas and play accurate crosses and he is also able to break with pace on the counter-attack (both on display for Chadli's first goal v QPR). He will hold the ball up so that attackers can get into position and he will also play flicks and first-time balls to guys running past him.

When confident he is also a reliable finisher as we saw last season, this pre-season, during his loan-spell, and in his time at Arsenal. While he may not be the quality of poacher that we have all seen Soldado was at Valencia, I think Adebayor is the guy we want starting games because of his ability to bring others into the game. Lamela, Chadli and Eriksen are all accomplished finishers, they aren't Aaron Lennon, all of the goal-scoring pressure won't be on our chosen #9 to always be on the end of things. Even if Ade doesn't finish the season with the magical 20 goals (which he is perfectly capable of doing), his assist numbers will definitely be in the double figures.

Don't get me wrong, to finish in the top four this season we will need all three of our strikers to hit form at different times and all bring their unique skillsets to getting balls in the back of the net for Tottenham. To start the season though, and to start the majority of games, Ade is our man because he is the most well-rounded and a truly world-class striker with at least one good year left.

Obviously this article doesnt offer a lot to go on, and mainly serves as an advert for a TV program to be broadcast later in the week, but it does have a few things here that I am incredibly wary of.

I think most people, if not agreeing with the idea of arranged marriages (or introductions) for example in the Indian community, are at least happy enough with the idea if both parties being married are introduced and make the decision of their own free will to go along with it. Ie, they are of the age of majority of 18 or over. 

Below that age, as here, that agreement becomes incredibly suspect as to how much the decision is actually the childs and how much is the parents, as you can easily shape a childs decision by telling half-truths that they probably arent going to recognise at a younger age.

Another thing I'm very worried about is this:

&gt;""She is a young girl. We'll train her. We won't beat her. In a few years' time she'll be a patient wife.""

From a purely logical perspective, he's a considerable upgrade on Negredo, Dzeko and Jovetic.

Some would argue he's a better finisher than Aguero.

He's a stunning player.

That said, his arrival will mean we persist with 2 up front, who would Pellegrini drop in a big game when he wanted the extra man in midfield? One of Aguero or Falcao would have to be dropped, and they're both superstars. It would take significant bottle to do that. And it could lead to unhappy players.

If Pellegrini doesn't drop one, and goes with a two man midfield with Yaya plodding around when we're out of possession, with his partner trying to do the job of two men, then there's no way we'll get past the last 16 in the CL, in fact we might not even get out of the group playing with that imbalance.

Yaya would have to majorly pull his finger out, or Pellegrini might even have to drop him for a Fernandinho/Fernando partnership, for the greater good of the side and the solidity out of possession.

And we all know Yaya can be a bit of a tart. So potential for upset there.

Then there's the fact that Jovetic will get less playing time, and he looks to be blossoming.

And we all know Dzeko can be a bit of a sulker, if he isn't playing regularly he'll struggle to find or maintain any form, so wouldn't be much use when we called on him.

So much potential for disruption and upset.

However, if it clicks, Aguero stays fit, and he forms an understanding and relationship with Falcao, then we could have the most lethal frontline in Europe.

You've been making ridiculous assumptions about people saying that every fan who said something positive about Torres only supported Chelsea for 1 year after playing Football manager. 

On another note, you are constantly having a go at anyone who is foreign and doesn't have A* perfect English. This isn't an English class, and it's a website that people from many countries can access, so why should people only be allowed to come from wherever you do? And so what if a foreigner supports Chelsea? I bet a lot of them are better fans than you are. Again, it's this thing of elitism. You want to try and prove you are better than the rest, and in turn, you make your self look like a grade A cunt.

However anytime I've heard anyone be questioned on it (like Alex Salmond last week) they have said straightly that Scotland does indeed have complete control over NHS policy and can't be forced to privatise it, but what they don't have is complete control of Scotland's public finances, and something has to take the hit when the budget gets squeezed. That's a true reflection of the situation; the fact remains that any spending cuts from Wesminster need to be reflected somewhere in the Scottish budget. 

It's analogous to the BT ""lose the pound"" soundbyte. The headline is not true, but there's an underlying truth to the argument, a bigger point, that gave rise to the soundbyte. 

Personally, I think TTIP is a bigger immediate risk to the NHS in Scotland than privatisation south of the border.  I'm quite sure you'll find a private provider willing to go to court to argue that because the UK is the sovereign state, Scotland cannot be exempted from competition for health provision regardless of devolved policy.

Before the ""Allison"" soldier girl commits suicide by firing the grapnel line (for Clara and the the Soldier who's last name is Blue), the Doctor says something along the lines of ""We can't miss this opportunity...I'm in a place I've never been before"".

It's possible that the Doctor expected the Dalek to have an internal defense system, but not be sure what that would be. When the soldiers start firing grapnels, the Doctor immediately shouts No and tries to stop them.

While you can argue that they should have had a briefing going in, they didn't and that's likely because they don't trust the Doctor (""I don't need babysitters"" says the Doctor before entry, and the bearded soldier says something like, ""we're here to shoot you if you're a Dalek spy"" or words to that effect).

Post 9/11 I saw an increase in abuse and general unease especially since I live in the North where multiculturalism isn't as great as London. Of course I can't complain too much because nothing like [this](http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/08/06/timeline-a-history-of-violence-against-sikhs-in-the-wake-of-911/) happened.

If anything it's worse because there is a long long history of people who identify themselves as Muslim raping Sikh and Hindu women; its happened  for centuries in India, continued [during the partition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdX0v-S-6u0) and is still [happening today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hXTM7ehvtk). The thing is that it's a problem amongst all ""South Asian"" communities and this is the equalling of a man's honour with a woman's virginity, its something that is still even in White British society too.

Back to your question, does it annoy me? A little bit, but I feel its a disservice to all of the upstanding and great Muslim people I know if I go out of my way to identify myself as Sikh as to not to be seen as Muslim, because of a select few. I'll do anything to promote and educate what I feel are the key values and unique aspects of my religion, but I won't do it merely to differentiate myself from another great religion which has it's own many merits and great people.

I feel that everyone needs to be educated about whats what, but even though Sikhs have such a great contribution British society and culture, people see turban and think Muslim, even though UK based Muslims will rarely wear a turban day to day like a Sikh does.

* Poch's system

  * I see this thrown around all too often as a buzzword to justify someone's position in an argument as to why player X does/doesn't fit with us. Unless you're on the training ground with them, you really don't know much more past ""attacking and stylish"". When it comes down to it, that's the most you can extrapolate coming from Southampton because we are a completely different team with completely different players. He will use a system he feels best for the team, and it will be ""Spurs' system"".

* Dembele's fitness

  * He's actually fit most of the time that people say he looks injured. There's talk of a mysterious ongoing hip issue, but I've never seen an official source on that (with searching). He has a unique style of play and kind of goofy walking posture.

* Holtby's *actual* usefulness

  * Boundless energy doesn't make you a shoe-in for starting in Poch's team. Much like being tall doesn't mean you're good at basketball.

* Rose's crossing

  * On par with most everyone else's crossing. If you're going to give him stick, best ask why Eriksen and Lennon can't seem to clear 5' when they cross on the run.

* Townsend's decision making

  * His skills are pace and dribbling ability. We want him to use those. Sometimes he will fail, sometimes he will not. This is like saying Eriksen has bad decision making if he misses a few passes each game (which he certainly does, more noticeably than other players, but I don't see him getting stick).

* Chiriches's ~~sanity~~ decision making

  * Usually gets praised in some way for this. Generally bad for us. ""Crazy but I love him"" is like what you say about a bad SO. Interesting talking point but still a problem none-the-less.

* Vertonghen's dedication

  * He is dedicated. Just because he had some slow games in the spring and a manager that thought it was fair to scapegoat him for his problems doesn't mean you need to flame him. This does seem to have died down now though.

* Eriksen's best position for us (left or middle)

  * Poch's got our midfield switching positions constantly throughout the game, please stop saying he should be playing in one or the other. He, and the two other mids, will inevitably play in both of them, at several points.

* Naughton's ability at RB

  * He's solid, and anyone saying we should sell him and put Dier there need to turn off the fantasy PL app for a minute.

* Yedlin's ability at RB

  * He's about on par with Fredericks, and it's really hard to gauge his ceiling until he actually gets in the league. Until then, no one here can really claim to know how high his ceiling is. Also, wtf how did so many of you forget Fredericks so quickly",0,1409484290,null,0,1409486690,0,ck5clb8,t3_2f2lsx,t1_ck5clb8,t3_2f2lsx,null,1427271303,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

Setting up your own business is relatively simple. Most accountants will include the set up for you. You fill out some simple forms, send them off, you now have a company. All good.

Setting up a bank account on the other hand, very long, drawn out, laborious. It's taken me two months of going backwards and forwards, and that's fast because my accountants were leading it. High street banks don't want to deal with small businesses. Personally, I think they make it difficult and lengthy on purpose. Just my experience.

As such, you may want to work via an umbrella company like http://www.parasolgroup.co.uk/ who I used for a number of years while doing contracts here and there.

This will cover you while you set up your business, bank account, get accountants sorted out etc etc.

Good luck!

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"&gt;This isn't about where playing CM or where else on the pitch. It's just about his techincal ability.

See, I knew you'd say that which is why I used Henry as an example of a World Class player so mediocre he got shipped of after 16 games because he was out of position - but a position with *similar* traits to how he played at CF. You think Henry never exhibited any of those things on the wings? Pace, dribbling, technique? Do you think Gotze would be good as a CM with defensive duties? Holtby played a lot of Futsal like Meyer did at Schalke, and he has WAY better technique and dribbling than you give him credit for. Like my non-factual article/quotes stated - *Lewis Holtby is also able to slip past defenders with quick shuffles of his body and feet. He has a low centre of gravity that helps him slalom in and out of challenges and appear on the other side with the ball.* He just doesn't get to show any of that at CM.

&gt;Look at some of the stuff Eriksen does with his feet. There is a wide gap in skill between the two of them. It's very apparent when you watch him play. Holtby's skill is his amazing ability to run around a lot, but he just doesn't have the special-ness and artistry that you really want from a #10.

I've seen him do similar things at AMC. Especially at AMC when he was given a entire run in the side like with Schalke - I can find you clips if you like so you can visually *see* it. Also, it seems like you're not suggesting Schalke are bad, but they're not much worse or much better than us. They regularly get CL football, and the German league is NOT weak at all. It isn't some piss poor standard of football like the Championship. The big bad EPL is not technically better than the Bundi, and he was their talisman, playmaker number 10. But he's got the touch of a pedo and is a mediocre player who just runs around...right? 

&gt;What's the point of looking at a scouting report when you've already seem him in Lilywhite.

You've seen him at CM at Spurs. Not at AMC with a consistent run in the team. Again, you say before that ''just watch Spurs games'' and ''he isn't good enough for Spurs''. He's playing out of position. Like I said, how would Gotze do at CM with defensive duties? Would he not be good enough because he's out of his depth? Mata? Any CM? The only difference with Holtby that gives an *illusion* he can play CM well is because of his high work rate. He's a mediocre CM, and a fantastic AMC. All you can judge him on is his mediocre performances at CM, hence my entire post to begin with and hence my argument. 

&gt;His energy off the bench is an incredible asset.

At the very least this. But I swear - you would be surprised if he actually got a run of games at AMC. The thought of Eriksen, Holtby and Lamela feeding a striker gives me a boner - and Holtby is technically aware enough to play alongside those two, especially if he can just focus his energies into pressing from an advanced position.

I'd rather the whole of the UK moved a little in that direction - but at least I can understand what you want and it's obvious you've given it some thought.

I'm actually in favour of the private sector and privatisation. Sadly we're so corrupt I don't want them anywhere near the NHS. Every privatisation has been abused and I suspect many ministers already have interests in privatisation or will be rewarded for it afterwards. Certainly the last labour government had plenty of ministers taking back handers. 

So until some sensible framework can be created that allows privatisation to be done properly I want nothing more done on it.

'A *good* Dalek' as opposed to 'A good *Dalek*', see what I mean? 
Now, it's a little weird that in the beginning they decided that the Dalek is good just because it wants to destroy other Daleks. Maybe there was supposed to be some significant piece of conversation that got cut out when they edited the episode or something like that. 
I just want to note that in the end Rusty remembers all the beautiful thing that made him good - but he doesn't call himself a *good* Dalek. Perhaps because he wants to destroy all the Daleks? And the Doctor is a *good* Dalek because he doesn't want to destroy them anymore, he wanted to save them and save the future. 

Still not sure what my point is. The Doctor have changed, the Dalkes sort of have changed, and there isn't an answer ""am I a good man""? because life isn't black and white. Everything can be both and inbetween.

After this episode felt such a massive wave of heartbreak and loneliness. I think the Doctor really needs Clara but you can't really ask her to give up her life. At least in the New Who every companion before Clara had problems in their life that they wanted to escape. Now we've got Clara who seems to be fine. On one hand I love how independent she is, on other hand it broke my heart seeing the Doctor alone in the end. 
I liked the slap she gave him and I like the idea of Clara mentally slaping him back into reality when he makes mistakes. 

I don't know you guys, I always find it hard to articulate what I feel, but this episode...I loved it, and I feel like something huge happened but I missed the meaning of it and it left me feeling shaken and worried. (It's just a TV show my arse) What's gonna happen to the Doctor? It feels like something very dark and terrifying is coming - way worse than dying on Trenzalore.

1. Frank Skinner: 
&gt;""I'll tell you what the gags were. David Baddiel said, something which in fact you virtually said yourself tonight [Michael Kelly]. [H]'e said I think the strange thing is that since [he has had] 'ez 'ad his beard and hair cut off he actually looks like a paedophile"".


2. David Baddiel: (quoted by Frank Skinner);
&gt;""... I can't believe there parents that let their kids sleep at Michael Jackons' house. Imagine your kids coming up and saying they are staying at Michael Jacksons'""

Frank Skinner: 
&gt;And I said 'OK, you can stay at Michael Jacksons' but let Matthew Kelly know you're not coming'.

The reason I referred to Frank Skinner as a recovering alcoholic is mentioned here;

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/frank-skinner-frank-and-fearless-6170663.html

Matthew Kelly in 2003 in the Telegraph;

&gt;Surrey detectives said yesterday that they had questioned him about a serious allegation but had found insufficient evidence to charge him.


Matthew Kelly;
&gt;""I am delighted and not surprised that after an extensive and thorough police investigation, which included inquiries abroad, it was obvious that there was no truth in a single allegation that was made against me"".

&gt;He was released from police bail but was cautioned for possessing cocaine.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1423028/Matthew-Kelly-in-the-clear-over-child-sex.html

To me there seems a big difference between what the police say and what Kelly says.

I did not find the original recording of the Skinner and Baddiel jokes/gags but I would be interested to watch a clip of the show.

To me it seems fair to compare one drug user (Michael Jackson) to another (Michael Kelly) who both have ""serious allegation(s) but ... insufficient evidence"" against them related to children.

After watching this clip the first time I looked up the effects of cocaine and paid attention reading up on the long term effects.
http://www.m.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cocaine-use-and-its-effects?page=2

The unfunny way to paraphrase what Skinner says is: ""I would no more let my kid stay with Matthew Kelly than I would let them stay with Michael Jackson"".

Matthew Kelly presses Skinner several times asking if he thinks the comments were fair?
I guess it's a matter of opinion.

There's no problem with a one-off appearance - the actor has a bit of fun, and exposure to an audience they might not usually get. Then they can go back to normal (acting) life.

For a long-term character, the actor can plan to settle in for a season or two.

But, for a recurring character, the actor needs to know they're going to get a reasonable return on their investment.

We seem to have different ideas about what sorites paradox is. To me – as it might apply to a constructed political animal, like the UK – it would be the death of a thousand cuts, not the lopping off of pieces of ever decreasing size &amp; importance, starting with the largest.

As for your reasons for favouring independence: well I honestly think you're vastly overstating the cultural differences between Scotland and rUK. It's clear to me there are far more differences between the classes across all of Britain than there are between people of the same class in each country. My work in a former job regularly brought me to Scotland, where I met workers from middle management and on factory floors, and it seemed to me they were hardly any different at all to their English or Welsh counterparts. And as I've said elsewhere in similar discussions in this sub, I'm pretty certain that I personally have far more in common – in pretty much every area of my life – with the regular working folks of Scotland, than I do with the public school educated elites in Whitehall *and* Holyrood. 

You see that's the point: a Yes vote isn't going to magically bridge the gap between the haves and the have-nots in Scotland. There's still going to be a divide between the classes who have different priorities and values. It seems to me the Yes camp now has hordes of people on board who think Scotland will be somehow miraculously transformed into a socialist utopia once it's independent, and I expect they will be in for a rude awakening when their dreams are exposed as delusions if it comes to pass.

And again, for most of the time he's played here, he has been put up as an AMC.  **He's had his opportunities.** This CM thing is new this year, because he's hasn't proven himself at that level.  It took 1 or 2 games for Eriksen to show that the #10 is his spot.   In a Spurs shirt, we've never seen Holtby play well aside from the odd preseason or Europa League match. 

Schalke is not on our level.   The in-squad competition and League competition is not on par with the Premier League plain and simple.  

All those players you mentioned,  regardless on what position they played, they would still show the technical ability to succeed.   Gotze would still show speed and touch.   Same with Henry and etc.   

This argument is going nowhere, so I'm going to bow out.   At the end of the day,  a player is responsible for his own career.  You have a mythological view of Holtby that doesn't jive with reality.

But, this is all whitewashing and ass-covering by Guardian columnists when incident after incident shows that fears over appearing to be prejudiced really do partly account for the authority's reluctance to get involved. 

He's changing the facts to suit his narrative.  In the Guardian's view, there's no such thing as over-zealous political correctness intimidating people from making the right choices.  So cognitive dissonance kicks in:  Oh, those people are just using it as an excuse because they're racist!  But that's not what the report found.  That's not what the report into Birmingham schools found either.

And this is the classic response of ideologues when it's shown to them that their ideology is false, or worse - has actually resulted in harm.  They will (often without knowing) bend the facts, rather than admit culpability.  Preserving the ideology and saving face is more important than stopping the harm.

A couple of days ago I posted to this subreddit a link to a 2011 Guardian column in which the columnist attacked The Times as racist for investigating Muslim rape gangs.

It doesn't take long before you want your 4 year old to eat something, ANYTHING rather than nothing. 

If I were to feed my wife and 4 kids from Iceland a diet of processed shit 'n chips, I reckon I could do it for about £45 to £50 a week.  If I feed them a balanced diet consisting of non-processed food and a lot of fresh veg, my weekly bill is closer to £100+ in term time pretty much where ever I shop - differences in ""raw"" unbranded produce are very minor round my way. (School packed lunches seem to add 10% to the overall cost)

The other thing I remember from a few years being a student and then living on the dole in the '80s, was never having enough money to buy in bulk.  25kg of rice is much cheaper in the long run than 500grms.

Derwent: Party college, with own socials and events like 'Big D' which my friend ran and managed to get Basshunter and Redlight (no show) and Artful Dodger to play. That being said, I went and I'm not Derwent.
Alcuin: Tends to have nicer rooms, but a bit quite. However some of the nosiest people I've met are from there. 
Vanburgh: Music / arts college. Puts on sweet jazz nights and is in the middle of History of Art etc.
James college: Sporty college, and friendly. That being said, they don't win everything, all colleges win stuff. Has a great location and rooms are good too!
Goodricke: On the new campus - if you have lectures on Hes East, stay here. Super modern ensuite rooms. You will find stuff over here, but not as much as Hes West. Need to take a bus over the Hes West. 
Langwith: This college was on Hes West, but has relocated to the new capus and is now super modern. There used to be a rivalry between Derwent and Langwith, but by now, that'll be lost as the last people to live in Langwith on the main campus have just left Uni. I have friends on committee and they are super involved with Langwith stuff.
Constantine: Not sure. Brand new. See for your self really! But really great rooms as on the new campus.
HALIFAX: The international college and a sports college. I was in Halifax (no, I'm not international). I love it here so much!! Rooms were good. I was in St. Lawrence Court, and didn't have ensuites, and there were 20 of us in a house. It's a bit out of the main campus - like 5-10 min walk away, but that didn't bother me. Also, no-one picks Halifax is like our motto, because it is a clearing college. It's big and friendly, and you seem to know everyone in a good way.

No matter what college you join, you will be able to do ANY society for the Uni, and there will be college sports teams available. You will have fun wherever you pick (unless your housemates are horrible, but then you can move house/college). For a better room, obviously you pay a bit more.

Ok.

&gt;Most of the time they are dealing with a falling apart NHS, there's no money, they can't afford to keep up with the latest treatments.

Do you work in the NHS? This is not a universal experience; many departments are thriving, others are failing. It's not all down to money. ""Latest treatments"" are decided by NICE, not most doctors.

&gt;Then there's a new horror story practically every day where someone has died because they were sent home wrongly, or misdiagnosed.

Wow. Have you ever stopped to think that happy stories don't sell papers well? Do you think the odd horror story negates the fact that millions of people are helped by doctors in the NHS each year?

&gt;There's a postcode lottery for cancer treatments.

Sometimes. This needs addressing, no one claimed to have a perfect system. Still not a doctor's fault, though.

&gt;Oh, and there was that whole thing about doctors allowing people to die, by not feeding them or giving them water.

This has never been a guideline at all. I can't speak for the odd ""horror story"" but virtually all hospitals until recently followed the Liverpool Care Pathway. It never advocated not feeding or giving drinks to patients. Nevertheless the shitstorm that the media brewed up meant that it's been abolished, and another virtually identical pathway has been set up.

&gt;All of this imo, has lead to a reversal of Doctor knows best syndrome. I'm not saying every patient knows best. But many patients do a lot of research on their particular ailment, and see how doctors around the world are treating it.

Patients on the whole are not equipped to make judgements on medical literature or statistics. Some doctors aren't great at this either, but all have substantially more training that Joe Public. If you are trained to analyse literature or the outcomes of trials, then by all means raise concerns with doctors. If you just say ""I read this on this internet, why I can't we use X to treat Y disease if the internet says so"" don't expect a great response.

Doctors *do* know better than the general public. Not all of them are flawless and everyone makes mistakes, but on the whole we should trust those trained to do their jobs.

Freedom of expression does not mean freedom from criticism, especially when your expression has such dubious subtexts.

&gt;I DON'T think the way women are portrayed in Doctor Who is something to be concerned about.

Then you haven't been watching.

&gt;For example: if a character in a drama happens to make remarks about a particular gender, I'm fine with that - it's the drama!

A very simplistic view.

&gt;Can I ask you if you were offended by Lizard Lady (I forgot her name) saying all men are monkeys? 

Did you read this bit in what I wrote?

&gt;Mary Sues are ultimately deeply misogynist because they are put on a pedestal - rather than being held to the same standard a everyone else, they are allowed to get away with more because they are, after all, ‘just women’ and so can be objectified either as lesbian wank fantasies (see last episode) or as wish fulfilment figures.

With that in mind, Madam Vastra's comment was offensive because it maintained the idea in our society that women are allowed to make snide comments about men because they're apparently not capable of being held to the same standards as them. It's misogyny excused by cod misandry.

And The Army's role was always to maintain order. Until 1972 the thinking was this would be brought about by stopping the IRA. After that however it was to force the IRA into politics exclusively and achieve peace.

Wages directly cause house price inflation. It's demand based.

If wages went up by 20% for everybody tomorrow house prices would quickly go up by 20%.

The housing crisis is purely supply and nothing else.

As for wages in general they're actually pretty good once you ignore housing costs. Renting is an absolute killer and that's what's causing problems.

The only reason the minimum wage is so far from a living wage is housing costs.

I don't like having to rely on him because I never know which Adebayor will show up and I'm seeing the big power house less and less.

Do you want them focusing on how they're going to repay their wonga loans or whatever they have.

these people have taken say 80k as a base salary and have gone and bought houses that are probably worth 300-400k, that's quite some mortgage and we'd just slash their pay to what? 40k ish.. who's going to pay that mortgage or pay their student loans off etc.

Not many people have the aptitude and ability to get at least 3A's in their A-levels, do a 5 year degree and then spend more years training.  Is it right to pay these ambitious people less because those cunts in stormont cant fucking agree on anything?

People slag off bankers etc for the money they make, but did anyone actually sit down and figure that maybe they're earning it.. in work from 7am, dealing with insane amounts of pressure, working till 7pm then having to deal with clients until maybe 10pm.. working 7 days a week.. thats not exactly sitting on the sofa getting a check from the government every two weeks.

If they want to save money, stop legally challenging stuff, get the fuck over gay marriage, blood donations and all that other crap those nut-job pricks go on about.

House - ok you have one. Planning to move or extend it at all? Have you ever worked out the tax efficiency of over paying your mortgage? 

Kids - school or uni costs covered?

Retirement - before you decide that you are over paying, how much income are you expecting per year in retirement. Again remember in your tax bracket the tax relief is a ton of free money that you miss if you switch to an ISA method.

Feminist' is a label to show that you support feminism, and nothing more. It does not mean you support Men's Rights, and it does not mean you support Gay Rights. It is exclusively about Women's Rights, which is not something I exclusively support.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"&gt;Enough with the Henry comparison

It's well known fact (/rumour) that Henry wasn't sold so quickly because they ''made money'', Henry was sold because he was a mediocre winger that didn't work out - who should (like you said) have exhibited those technical qualities (dribbling, pace) anyway. 

&gt;He's had his opportunities.

He hasn't, at all. Eriksen had the added advantage of playing in a 4-3-3 with Ajax and playing at AML. AVB played a 4-3-3 with two CM's. Holtby played primarily at CM - like I said, would Gotze or Max Meyer excel from a CM position, playing the same role as Holtby? Yet would you take both of them in a heart beat? I guarantee it. Would they look as good at CM as they do at AMC? Not at all. Not even close, I've seen it in times of ''desperation'' for BvB and Schalke and no - it doesn't work. Same reason Sahin failed at Madrid/Pool, like Klopp said ''wrong position''. Kagawa was immense, truly a fantastic player. Now, ruined. Same will apply here, and it's sad. 

My argument isn't xxx is better than xxx, my argument is Poch NOW plays the same system that Lewis excelled in (4-2-3-1) compared to the 4-3-3 we stuck with - so he can become a much more valuable player if he gets time in his ideal position. He also has the exact traits you want from a AMC in a Poch system - he closes down way more than Eriksen does and has much more energy. That's my point. And before you said technique, Holtby played a lot of Futsal - I've seen him do things Eriksen has when he's in his natural position. If I had the time, I'd show you. But I don't think I wanna waste a Sunday editing every cute touch, skill, assist and potential assist (if Hunterlear didnt' fuck so many chances up) to actually *show you* he can. 

&gt;Schalke is not on our level. 

If we played Schalke 10 times, full strength - I'd be surprised if we won a majority of them. They're a great side who I think you're underrating just a little. 

&gt;the opportunities he had when he did play AMC.

The extremely rare, hit and miss, inconsistent times he played at AMC. You're right. And even then, he played some fantastic passes (see Defoe v Villa) that a ''unskilled, mediocre'' player couldn't dream of playing. I wish I had enough time to sit on Vegas and edit down these ''moments'' both from him with us and at Schalke so you can see exactly what I'm talking about - but like you said, the argument is going nowhere. You have your opinion on him, based entirely off him playing out of position, and I have mine where I've seen him play his natural position. 

You keep using terms like mythological, yet you haven't ever seen him play consistently at AMC, ever. Half this sub think's that he's a CM - whenever I see ''we have too many CM's, who do we move on - Dembele, Sandro, Holtby.....HES NOT A CM. It's just AVB played 4-3-3, and we didn't use a AMC.

But we'll see what happens. If we lose Holtby, it'll be a huge blow because now he's playing in a system that fits him PERFECTLY to a tee, and we (I and every pundit/scout who watched him and wrote articles) know what he is capable off when he plays there. If he is/was as bad as you are suggesting, why would it be imperative they replaced him? Surely they'd be happy to see the back of him. But to Schalke, he was their push for CL football. Ironically, his transfermarkt (not accurate, but a reflection of sorts) was showing is value rise up...and up....and up, to about 11m. Then he joined us. Down....down.......down. We're ruining a great talent. It sucks. 

Funnily enough, he's the same age as Townsend - yet had a slightly more productive season out of position with more goals/assists yet when I mention that T word on here - he get slaughtered. Fickle or what? 

Thanks for the discussion and keeping it civil though. I noticed someone keeps downvoting me, which is fine - but this sub is entirely for discussions. I wish people appreciated in depth discussion - I could understand people downvoting me if I didn't back it up or anything. But it's all good :)

She has almost no personality, no independent goals or life, and her only role seems to be randomly speaking lines that would normally be given to the Doctor (either solving obvious problems or moralizing in the way he typically does/used to).

Clara has vacillated between a carictured manic pixie dream girl and a human plot device. If they continue this and make her an actual person, that would be great.

It's only really in later years when we are getting much tighter series(mostly thanks to a reduce episode count) that we are seeing shows start much stronger.

While there is widespread support for independence in the Basque Country too, the Catalan Government plans to hold a referendum on independence in November, shortly after Scotland's own independence referendum, which it is widely expected to win. Whether the vote will actually take place, though, is currently [up in the air](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/catalonia-may-suspend-independence-referendum-1.1908744).

Even with all this going on though, I would be extremely surprised if EU membership for Scotland was blocked. Scotland, as a part of the UK, is already signed up to a plethora of European conventions on everything from human rights to carbon emissions. It is also unquestionably a fully functioning democracy and a prosperous part of Europe. There would be no grounds upon which to block an attempt at accession.  

I imagine there would be sticking points (for instance what happens with respect to monetary union), but there will be two years between the referendum and independence day to hammer out differences and come to an agreement. Should negotiation take longer than that, there is simply no way agreements would not be reached to extend free movement of people and goods to those resident in Scotland for their duration - the EU is an inherently expansionist organisation, and there is no way it will effectively revoke the EU citizenship of five million plus of its citizens.",0,1409489197,null,0,false,0,ck5djcq,t3_2f2k2b,t1_ck5djcq,t1_ck5cwxe,null,1427270862,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,the_oncoming_storm,CommonWeal,,"&gt;  think it's reasonable to say that an independent Scotland would give lenders pause on Scottish mortgages - higher rates or tighter LTV requirements for example. I work in the industry and this is reasonable.

Not my industry, although I did get a mortgage last year.

I would assume that if we were still linked to the Bank of England (through one way or another), then it's unlikely to affect mortgage rates, as they already reflect the lending risk. Lending requirements appear to have been tightened up so much over the last year (a friend had to had over several years of financial records while applying recently), that I don't really expect much in the way of change. Of course, you have the knowledge here, so I could be reading it wrong.

I don't buy the argument that house prices are depressed because of the referendum. I'd say that they aren't rising again because the ""economic recovery"" (such as it is) hasn't benefited the wages of the average worker in Scotland. So, I don't really expect independence to bring a bump or a reduction in house prices (perhaps a bit of short term churn is to be expected).

Despite the fact I don't especially want to get into negative equity, I favour controlling prices through the German model of investing in really high quality public sector rental accommodation, creating building and maintenance jobs in the process.  I'd like to see the average wage to house price ratio come down, but it has to be carefully managed, and preferably it'll be through driving up wages than the other way round.",0,1409489205,null,0,false,0,ck5djf7,t3_2f2lkq,t1_ck5djf7,t1_ck5baxn,null,1427270861,1,false,scottishpolitics,t5_2u66o,1

I also believe pandering to a minority is a bad idea and Muslims are treated far more carefully than other ethnic or even natives. Take some schools in London banning all non halal meat which is not only bad for animal welfare but offensive to Christianity (since it's meat offered up to another religions good). This has also happened in the army who will not employ people with food allergies but can apparently pander to religion.

Eto'o immediately proved that he was a good addition to the squad, I'm expecting more like that from him for the next 2 years. Naismith confidence is through the roof because he's scored 3 in 3. Mirallas was creating chances and putting them in. However, we did have some glaring issues. After the first 3 Howard seemed to stop making an effort to get down to the ball/dive/jump for it. Distin and Jagielka together had a lot of errors that led to goals. Jagielka has been decent in the other 2 games but Distin has been really out of form for all 3. We need another CB. I know we've still got Stones but I think we need someone with a little bit of experience as well so we can swap out Distin/Jags when they get tired or if they can't recover to full form. Also, Besic needs something big next week. The only choice Martinez has ever made that I thought was a bad call was yesterday when he subbed in Besic. He needed to have been subbed in during a game where he could come in with a lead and just sit more defensively to gain some confidence, but instead he comes in to a 3-5 game, and his first touch he attempts to be fancy and causes a goal.

What hasn't changed though is LTV which is where the risk is. If the bank repossesses a house it won't get anything like market value for it - 20-40% worse, and that's where the loss is made.

But the main effect is that if house prices go down by 20% then many people go into negative equity and others have to pay more interest.

Your mortgage for example - if you had less than a 50% deposit then a 20% change in house prices will affect the rates you're able to get.

&gt;Despite the fact I don't especially want to get into negative equity, I favour controlling prices through the German model of investing in really high quality public sector rental accommodation, creating building and maintenance jobs in the process. I'd like to the the average wage to house price ration come down, but it has to be carefully managed, and preferably it'll be through driving up wages than the other way round.

You're dead on the money here.

I can't think of a successful privatisation (at least not in my lifetime), so that's why I'm wary of it. I accept that putting things out to competition can be a good thing, but not if service provision suffers (or costs increase) due to required profit margins. I generally object to taxpayers funding private business profits through government spending, although it can't always be avoided.  I wonder if there's a country that has got a good model for privatisation. That's a research topic for another day. 

I do wonder about how to limit ministerial corruption. I have some ideas for improvements: I'd like to see a model where sitting ministers have increased salaries, say, £120K, but are not allowed expenses on anything but accommodation (no subsistence, no minibar) while on parliamentary business.  No second jobs, no sitting on boards, no pay for after dinner speaking. The state pays for any secondary accommodation, and it's returned to the state after the minister is no longer an MP/MSP.  

(as an aside, we could also tie parliamentary pay to the average wage)

If you follow that general principle, the single biggest issue is stopping lobbying on the promise of a board position after the minister is no longer an MP.  I've no idea how you can work around that.

One absolutely everyone has to do was Personal and Professional Development  which focused on building a work portfolio, polishing your CV and the skills that it takes to apply for jobs and internships.

As far as electives go, it varies from course to course. During my first year I've had 8 modules, including 1 elective. This is because in comp sci they like to give you the foundation knowledge that can then be applied in your second your. In my second year I will be doing a similar amount of modules, but I think only 2 or 3 are compulsory. So after your first year you get much more freedom. On the other hand, a friend of mine that is doing history at the same university only had 2 or 3 compulsory modules in his first year and everything else was electives. So ultimately it depends on the nature of the course. Check with with individual universities.


As for extra curricular stuff there are tonnes. Every university will have a wide choice of societies. [E.g. here is my unis list of societies](http://www.abersu.co.uk/societies/societieslist/). As you can see, there are groups that put people together based on their hobbies, nationalities , political ideas and religious views. So really there is something out there for everyone, and if there really isn't anything that you fancy then you can always start your own society. Since you mentioned sport [here is also a separate list with all the sports clubs](http://www.abersu.co.uk/sports/clublist/)

true,Eloquai,null,null,"&gt; How does this compare to the UK system? Do you stay with your chosen topic all through university, are there core requirements everyone has to fulfill, or do students regularly take electives?

It will depend upon the course profile of your degree but, generally speaking, the vast majority of your academic study will occur in classes directly connected to your degree. Some university departments may allow you to take modules in other departments within the same faculty (i.e. you might take some history classes if you study politics but you probably won't able to take classes in biochemical engineering). It'll depend though upon your university and their departments.

&gt; Are there similar clubs for other cultural identities, like students who belong to a certain religious or ethnic group?

Yup. My university has a huge society for all international students in addition to societies for students from different national/religious backgrounds. I think this is usually the case in all universities. 

&gt; Are there activity-based clubs? 

You traditionally have societies that are formed around hobbies (this could range from cinema to knitting) and societies formed around physical activities and sports.

&gt; Mostly, I'm curious about how people in the UK make friends during this part of their lives.

People make friends at university in numerous ways. Whilst some find their friends through societies, others make friends from their course-mates and housemates. Everyone has a different experience in this field.

You'll then do classes almost entirely in Chemistry, with deviations into maths, physics or biology applied to chemistry. Some courses are a little more flexible, e.g. I applied to do Natural Sciences which meant i could pick and choose science and maths subjects to do and then specialised in my final year. This basically let me avoid things i didn't like and do what i enjoyed most.

Universities generally have very diverse cultural societies, there was one for pretty much every part of the world and every religion at my university.

Activity based clubs and societies are almost the same thing, for example, there'll probably be a surfing society, which organizes cheap trips to the coast for surfing/nights out. Societies will become regular social groups and its normal to meet up not just to do activities but also for nights out or whatever. I joined the rowing club when i attended and it became a way to do rowing and organize nights out around training so being hungover during training was avoided.

Making friends typically happens by just being forced near to strangers. You'll move into a house with strangers who'll become your friends, then you'll meet people on your course and meet people in societies, nights out. It all happens very fast and the biggest challenge is remembering peoples names!

true,djangounfazed,null,null,"There is something to be said for a parent taking interest in their child's therapy. As a medic in training, I am nearly always relieved whenever the parents have any kind of initiative into their child's illness, treatment plans, management - its not only the sign of good parenting per say, but that they are fully cogent in modern medicine. They're the ones that know their child best and know when something is going wrong - things that aren't immediately obvious to a clinician - if a child is being too quiet/too loud/behaving oddly for their personality etc. I'd rather have a parent that asks me difficult questions than one that doesn't seem to care what we do any day.

Of course there are scenarios that take it too far and this is one of them. Certainly taking a well (and I mean that in the clinical sense - ie not displaying any outward signs illness/distress) child abroad for an unproven and barely tested medical therapy would be extremely worrying; taking a child out of hospital in post-operative care when they're being given neo-adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy for a medulloblastoma (a *highly* malignant brain cancer with a huge chance of recurrance) on the basis of potential long term risks is in my opinion criminal neglect.

Another statement that set alarm bells ringing was the claim that he was threatened with an emergency treatment order for 'asking questions'. Not only is this highly unlikely, but the tone and language that he used to gloss over his part in this was very very suspect - I'm certainly sure that we're only getting the parents side in that video - though its pretty much nil likelihood that the full details of the incidents leading up to this will ever be released. The main problem being that children are an entirely separate legal entity when it comes to healthcare - as there is always a careful balancing act between provision of treatment and respecting parental wishes. On one hand you don't want to take the child's health out of the parent's hands entirely, but you don't want to leave it to their own decision completely.

This case is pretty clear cut for me. The doctors were asked for their medical opinion and knowledge - they gave it.

No, that's not quite what happened.

The children were not white. The parents had expressed support for policies that would target non-white citizens of the UK. In the long-term interests of the children it made sense to place them with another foster family.

To be clear, a foster family is not an adoptive family. These people were not parents. They were paid carers. It made sense to the council that such children would be better served by people who believed that they had an equal place in this society.

The media basically misreported that over and over and over again.

&gt; Multiculturalism is good, as long as it isn't harming members of society. Quite a few Muslim boys are joining ISIS, being radicalised, and the UK is suffering. 

There are no actual statistics on how many British muslims are joining ISIS, but even if they do, it is not clear exactly how their actions harm the UK specifically.

Britain has a history of its citizens volunteering in foreign wars, and for many people back at home to shake their head and wonder what the hell is going on. Go and read up on Orwell and the Spanish civil war.

You really are.

&gt; I myself am an immigrant I'll have you know 

That likely makes you more likely to be racist. Sorry, but your idea of what Britain is and should be will be based on a faux idealism if you are a recent immigrant. We are probably a more tolerant country than you are used to.

More importantly, if you were born in a foreign country, it seems strange that you yourself are complaining about the influence of other cultures on Britain, oblivious to the fact your own argument is a form of cultural diversity.

&gt; yet I follow the laws of this country and care for its citizens. 

That is irrelevant. The people who don't follow the laws are being prosecuted.

The real concern I raise in my longer post on this topic is that the original report points that for many years the police and council workers who should have been following the law, did not.

&gt; If you have nothing to hide then why be scared.

Oh FFS, that is complete and utter fucking bullshit.

Please, do not sit there as a foreign-born immigrant to the UK preaching what our laws should be and using that argument *until* you understand the culture *far, far* better than you currently do.

Most will have core modules that are compulsory, but then a set of elective ones that you can choose between. The compulsory ones will vary on the degree, (someone can correct me if this is wrong), but it'd be unusual for a degree such as science to require you to do an arts module or vise versa. A foreign language and maths option would be more wide spread as they are useful in many careers.

You may share some lectures with different courses if there's a common route between them, for example I am currently doing a science degree, but I share some lectures with med students (maths, chemistry, biology). What you share with who will depend entirely on the courses and university.

There is usually a student's union that has organised clubs that cover just about everything.

true,ppphhh,null,null,"&gt; Do you stay with your chosen topic all through university

In general yes. We don't really have the minor/major system, the vast majority of people will just do Physics or English or whatever, and stick with it for the entire time, usually with the same group of people although for things like engineering, lots of specialised subjects might lump together for a core topic. It's possible to do X with Y, especially if they're related, but it's fairly uncommon and not guaranteed. Our core learning is done at the GCSE (high school) level, after that we're free to do whatever we like.

&gt; like students who belong to a certain religious or ethnic group?

Not so much ethnic groups, but UK universities are generally pretty international and there's normally a society for any large group, like a Chinese society or an American society. I guess you might have African American societies, we don't really do that. At least, if there was one at my university I never heard of it. I'm white though. There are societies for all the religions and they're fairly well populated, but probably quite different from what you have in the US, since most British people aren't religious. 

&gt;Are there activity-based clubs? 

Absolutely, and at my university most societies or clubs were like this. Most sports were covered, from soccer to kayaking. We even had an American football team. I guess they're casual compared to American style big college games, but people take it fairly seriously and train several times a week, that sort of thing. There are regional tournaments but big inter-uni games with hundreds of spectators are rare, more of a big end-of-year event than a regular occurrence. As for other societies, there's normally one for each subject (I for instance was in the Physics society) which might arrange nights out or dinners or trips, or get guest speakers in, that sort of thing. I was also in the IT society which had its own little computer lab with all the servers and things set up as projects by the members. I was never really into it but there were a lot of more casual activity ones, like hiking, and lots that revolved around anime or movies or sci-fi, stuff like that. Our university had a professional quality student-run newspaper and I imagine that's fairly common too.

More generally, people tend to make friends simply by being forced to live together in halls (shared kitchens and bathrooms, not rooms) and by studying together. It's typical to have ""Fresher's week"" when everyone moves in, and everyone goes out drinking every night for a week to make friends. Societies are a good way to do more but were definitely optional in terms of socialising, in my experience.

But Spain has other concerns here, namely that vetoing Scotland will decimate their fishing industry (bye, bye north sea access and the EU fisheries policy). 

Ejecting a current region of the EU, in addition to going against the right of self-determination which would be odd for the EU to rally against, also potentially causes a lot of turbulence to trade, fishing, displacement of citizens (EU in Scotland and Scots elsewhere - although the citizenship argument goes deeper than that. Legal precedent seems to indicate that EU citizenship is somehow greater than just being a citizen of an EU country), and so on.  All of which would be remarkably pointless if the EU were just going to let Scotland in again a few years later.

Three different times I went to A&amp;E at hospitals in desperation only to be told that everything would have go through local GPs, where getting a 10 minute appointment for one issue means queuing up in the morning outside the surgery half an hour before it opens or waiting three weeks, just to be told that ""it's probably nothing"" with no tests done and no referrals. Walk-in centres said I had to see my GP as well. I changed GPs but all the ones I could register with had very similar standards. I told three different dentists my teeth with the abscess hurt (before I knew what it was) and none of them would take an xray even if I asked because ""it's probably just your teeth moving"".

I had to leave the UK to get help, which I got within three months after all this went on for over a year in the UK *while trying to get help*. I got no treatment in the UK, no diagnoses, no tests, even while trying to get help.

The problem was I thought the doctors knew what they were doing and trusted them, instead of leaving sooner, now I have to deal with the damage to my body.  If I was too calm I was ignored because obviously I was fine, and if I got upset I was ""being hysterical"". At one point I was told I had ""health anxiety"", an ""anxiety"" which funnily enough had gone away now I've had treatment for these physical health issues (in Australia and later Norway), and feel much better, most of it apart from some surgeries I needed was dealt with at GP level.

I don't know enough about this case to comment on the parents, but the NHS and doctors in general are not infallible.

true,mattcraiganon,eng-manchester,Manchester/Nottingham,"&gt;I know what you're saying, but the trouble is, when Doctors make mistakes it costs lives. And I did used to completely trust Doctors. The fact that I don't anymore is not completely down to them, mismanagement by various governments has led us down this path.

So do firemen, police, soldiers, air traffic controllers. Humans aren't perfect, all we can do is learn from our mistakes. We haven't got foresight and it's easy to criticise in hindsight.

Judging all doctors on the basis of a few bad experiences is like banning everyone from driving for the actions of a few hit and runs.

&gt;As for the Liverpool pathway thing, you tell the relatives that, the ones who saw the don't give food or water signs attached to their loved ones. The ones who had parents begging for water, and not being given it. Or are they all hysterical liars, whipped up by the media. I'm not a particular fan of the media, but we need them precisely for things like this.

I have absolute sympathy if any of these purported to be true are so. I don't know if they are. A lot of it was reported by tabloids and only told one side of the tale. It still has no bearing on whether all doctors are beyond reproach.

&gt;Things that need to be brought to the attention of the public, not swept under the carpet.

I agree.

&gt;And if there's another identical pathway, then sooner or later this will come under the spotlight too, because Doctors aren't supposed to play god.

What? Doctors do that every day by saving lives or maintaining life. God doesn't exist anyway, so not a problem.

&gt;but that doesn't mean I think it's ok for people to have to sit and watch their loved ones die because they are inconveniently hanging around.

They do.  They need to get a second opinion before making a run for it.  There's no mention of one having been obtained.  It sounds like they want to the Czech Republic and figure it out there.  That's not how it's done.  It puts the child at unnecessary risk.

&gt; I don't know when doctors decided they wanted all the power.

Doctors can go along with parents until they feel parents are being unreasonable.  Taking the kid out of hospital without organising it properly is dangerous.  Someone needs to protect the child from this reckless maltreatment - intentional or not.

&gt; How is this better for him?

For starters, his life is not at risk.  His parents probably won't be prosecuted anyway, so they'll join him soon.  Receiving the treatment on offer is known to be pretty good (up to 80% survival at 5 years).  Proton beam therapy doesn't have the same volume of evidence. 

If they still want care at another hospital, they can organise it safely.",0,1409492333,null,0,false,0,ck5ebvb,t3_2f2k9e,t1_ck5ebvb,t1_ck5cu95,null,1427270492,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

What it comes down to is that Moffat seems to be the first show-runner who's really fascinated by the idea of the Doctor living forever and the way time goes differently for the Doctor than it does for us and his companions. (Well if it has happened before feel free to correct me, I don't know everything ofc)

Before it was part of the Doctor's character, his mystique, that he was actually many hundreds of years old. But beyond that they didn't do that much with it. Moffat had the whole 900 vs 1200 as a key plot point. He has the Doctor popping in and out of his companions lives, with possibly countless years going by for him in between. And of course having the Doctor age 900 years in the Time of the Doctor.

That is why, even though Moffat keeps saying in interviews how the Doctor himself isn't sure how old he is, the Moffat era has a lot more pronounced sense of how old the Doctor is and how he ages compared to earlier eras when it bounced around and wasn't paid too much attention to.",0,1409492543,null,0,false,0,ck5edyy,t3_2f113q,t1_ck5edyy,t1_ck55yiz,null,1427270465,24,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,24

Nonsense.  If someone's absconds and is at risk of death, doctors are duty-bound to inform the police.  The police, in turn, need to find them.  Doctors in this case haven't forced any management.  

The parents took the child out of hospital and exposed him to risk unnecessarily.  They had absolutely no right to do that.  If they wanted to take him to another hospital, they should have found a consultant who wanted to take the case, and then asked for a transfer - which would have happened.

&gt; Now the kid is alone with people he doesn't know at a time when he's possibly dieing. This is not best for that kid.

The kid's life is no longer at any immediate risk.  From the information available to us, he's more likely to survive than not.

We took in over sixty letters of character references to illustrate how ludicrous the suggestion of abuse was - the Child Protection Officer ""looked at two or three"". We'd said to them when it was first put to us ""OK, we understand, you've found some signs that you have to investigate - it's a sad sign of the times, but go ahead. Look into all of us - but please, don't let this interfere with actually investigating what the cause is, because not knowing is terrifying"" - and all investigation stopped. With stuff like this, I got told several times ""it's procedure, don't take it personally"" - to which I'd reply ""This is my *son* - what would *you* consider personal? Cutting my leg off?"". The oath is supposed to involve 'do no harm', and asserting that no other possible cause could be considered *because the doctor hasn't seen it before* doesn't, in my book, really count. And that's before we get to the later infections and loss of 50p size bits of skull...I'm not supposed to be worrying about how much total damage my son is going to take on because of two investigations that find nothing (yes, two - the Liver Team ended the investigation because they knew the cause could be Alagille's, but the Neurologist started a new one based on...er...hence we started digging ourselves. Don't dismiss internet searching if the person knows a valid souce when they see one (I've been online since [Compunet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compunet), so I like to think I'm fairly competent).

The hospital originally sent a single page brush-off apology, which became a seventeen-page apology and a personal apology from the Chief Exec after the General Medical Council investigated our complaints and upheld a good number of them, including the neurologist who didn't want to know anything outside of her own limited diagnosis, the lack of co-operation between the neurology and liver departments, the medical records that had been altered to show our son supposedly being given fluids (a bit daft since his stats carried on going down during the time period involved and showed as much)...mostly arse-covering stuff, but at least they're now more aware - I just wish it hadn't cost my son part of his skull before they did so.",0,1409493348,null,0,1409524637,0,ck5emhf,t3_2f1avo,t1_ck5emhf,t1_ck5ec0w,null,1427270355,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Dier was higher up the pitch because he's a fullback. Fullbacks are almost wingers in poch's system. The deep midfielders are more responsible for defense when in transition. Townsend had 5 seconds to acquire the match pace that Moreno had been flying at all match.

We were also pushing high up the pitch because we're down 2-0 at home in the 2nd half against a great team. You've gotta go for it.

It was a spectacular goal scored by Sterling and Moreno. Liverpool are flying. If they played like this against the likes of Bayern or Real or Chelsea or whomever, they would be very likely to win. Give them heaps of credit, give credit to the manager, he's prepared his team very well.

true,emmytee,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"Based on a quick google - you are right, but only in 1 to 1.5 of those countries depending on definitions. 

1: I would consider pegging a Scottish pound to the euro to be a political cowards way of joining the euro quietly. Croatia and Bulgaria have done this, and made promises to join the eurozone later which will be economically very painless if they have been pegged for years prior to it anyway. 

2: Romania has set a target date for joining of 01.01.2019

3: Poland fails 3/5 requirements for the euro because it runs too high a deficit and won't agree to the EU deficit policy marching orders. The current government supports joining the euro, the opposition does not and the people generally don't either because of recent events with the euro crisis etc.

4: The Czech republic, however, is basically doing the Sweden strategy of just dragging their heels about joining ERMII. I wasn't aware that this was the case. The Czech government has variously indicated it would  join in: 2010, 2012 , 2015 &amp; 2019. Currently they are in the process of weaseling out of 2019.

So it looks like you might be right that Salmond would get away with not doing it, but I would point out that *every single one* of the countries you mention has repeatedly promised to join the eurozone. The Czech republic have set targets over and over, but never do it. It seems reasonable to say that Scotland would have to commit to join the eurozone, but be really vague about it and get away with running our own thing. 

If we keep the pound, it becomes a very complex negotiation indeed, and I have no idea if the EU would let that slide - maybe they would. But it would also see the creation of a competing currency union of pound sterling which might not be terribly popular on the continent. 

The one other thing I would say, is that for a small country like Scotland the euro seems to be the second best option to the pound. For all its problems, the euro might bring a bit of stability to an independent scotland should it be denied the pound.

true,Emunim,cnty-scotland,North Britain,"&gt;My normal response to this is to suggest that it would be in Spain's interests to formalise a path to EU ascension where succession is done with government consent, thereby effectively ruling out a path to EU membership where succession of a region occurs without government consent.

That doesn't really rule it out though. It might make breakaway regions more likely to seek state approval at first, but if that approval is never going to be granted then that precedent wouldn't mean anything.

&gt;But Spain has other concerns here, namely that vetoing Scotland will decimate their fishing industry (bye, bye north sea access and the EU fisheries policy).

This is the most likely reason, however given Spains other concerns it may mean we have to be more generous in the allocations given to other countries, at least in the short term. But I'll emphasize the may in there.

&gt;Ejecting a current region of the EU, in addition to going against the right of self-determination which would be odd for the EU to rally against, also potentially causes a lot of turbulence to trade, fishing, displacement of citizens (EU in Scotland and Scots elsewhere - although the citizenship argument goes deeper than that. Legal precedent seems to indicate that EU citizenship is somehow greater than just being a citizen of an EU country), and so on. All of which would be remarkably pointless if the EU were just going to let Scotland in again a few years later.

Almost certainly there will be interim arrangements to deal with these things in the short to medium while it is determined whether EU membership can be agreed. If it can't, it might be that those arrangements go on indefinitely.",0,1409493650,null,0,false,0,ck5epta,t3_2f2k2b,t1_ck5epta,t1_ck5e5rj,null,1427270311,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,bl4ckfriar,null,null,"My advice would be to utilise the various current accounts that offer interest. Without going into the hassle of opening joint accounts I would use the following method:

1) TSB allows you to own two Classic Plus current accounts. These offer 5% (before tax) interest on balances up to £2000 and require a £500 monthly deposit in order to qualify. The deposit doesn't have to stay in the account and so cascading through accounts is an acceptable method of paying in.

2) Nationwide allows you to own one FlexDirect current account. This again offers 5% (before tax) interest, but on balances up to £2500. It does require a minimum of £1000 a month going into the account, however. The 5% on this is only valid for 12 months on opening the account.

4) Club Lloyds offer 4% on balances between £4000 and £5000 and require £1500 a month going through the account.

5) Tesco Bank offer 3% on balances up to £3000, with £750/month going through the account.

None of these charge you for not paying in, you just don't accrue interest for that month.

For the next 12 months I would do this:

Sept: Open two TSB Classic Plus accounts and a Nationwide FlexDirect. Into each of the TSB accounts deposit £500. This takes care of the monthly deposit requirement in order to gain interest.   
  (TSB1: £500, TSB2: £500, Nationwide: £0, Total: £1000)

Oct: Deposit £500 into TSB1 and then transfer into TSB2 the following day. This meets the £500 monthly pay in requirements for each.   
  (TSB1: £500, TSB: £1000, Nationwide: £0, Total: £1500)

Nov: Deposit £500 into TSB1 and then transfer into TSB2 the following day.   
  (TSB1: £500, TSB2: £1500, Nationwide: £0, Total: £2000)

Dec: Deposit £500 into TSB2 and then transfer into TSB1 the following day.   
(TSB1: £1000, TSB2: £1500, Nationwide: £0, Total: £2500)

Jan: Now that you can pay in £1000 a month you don't need to transfer internally for the TSB accounts! Deposit £500 into TSB1 and £500 into TSB2   
(TSB1: £1500, TSB2: £2000, Nationwide: £0, Total: £3500)

Feb: TSB2 is now at it's limit, so it's time to start getting interest elsewhere as well. You already have your Nationwide account open and it requires £1000 per month going through the account. Luckily, you're now able to make that. However, you still need to fulfil the TSB requirements of £500 per month to qualify for the interest. Deposit £500 into each of the TSB accounts and then transfer £500 from each TSB account to Nationwide the next day. N.B: You still have £500 of space left in the TSB1. This will be filled later.   
(TSB1: £1500, TSB2: £2000, Nationwide: £1000, Total: £4500)

March: Deposit £500 into each of the TSB accounts and then transfer £500 from each TSB account to Nationwide the next day.   
(TSB1: £1500, TSB2: £2000, Nationwide: £2000, Total: £4500)

April: Your Nationwide account is nearly at capacity. It's time to utilise that TSB1 space! Deposit £500 into each of the TSB accounts and then transfer £500 from each TSB account to Nationwide the next day. The following day, transfer £500 from the Nationwide into TSB1  
(TSB1: £2000, TSB2: £2000, Nationwide: £2500, Total: £5500) 

March: This is where it starts to get slightly more tricky. You've maxed out your accounts and need somewhere else to get interest. Lloyds offers the next best level of interest, but requires a higher monthly payment AND at least £4000 to start earning it. You could move your TSB money into there and cycle the Nationwide in and out, but you're slightly better off opening a Tesco Bank account at 3% and put money into there. So, deposit £500 into each of the TSB accounts and then transfer £500 from each TSB account to Nationwide the next day. The following day move £1000 into your Tesco account.  
(TSB1: £2000, TSB2: £2000, Nationwide: £2500, Tesco: £1000 Total: £6500) 

April: Same again this month, deposit £500 into each of the TSB accounts and then transfer £500 from each TSB account to Nationwide the next day. The following day move £1000 into your Tesco account.   
(TSB1: £2000, TSB2: £2000, Nationwide: £2500, Tesco: £2000 Total: £7500) 

May: And again. Deposit £500 into each of the TSB accounts and then transfer £500 from each TSB account to Nationwide the next day. The following day move £1000 into your Tesco account.   
(TSB1: £2000, TSB2: £2000, Nationwide: £2500, Tesco: £3000 Total: £8500) 

June: Now that your Tesco is at £3000, you'll have enough to open a Club Lloyd's with this month's deposit. Transfer £3000 into Lloyds. Deposit £500 into each of the TSB accounts and then transfer £500 from each TSB account to Nationwide the next day. The following day move £1000 into Lloyds. This takes care of the monthly pay-in for June.  
 (TSB1: £2000, TSB2: £2000, Nationwide: £2500, Tesco: £0, Lloyds: £4000 Total: £9500) 

July: You just need to watch out for the £1500 throughput of the Lloyds account this month. Deposit £500 into each of the TSB accounts and then transfer £500 from each TSB account to Nationwide the next day. The following day move £1500 from Nationwide into Lloyds. The following day, move £500 back to Nationwide.   
(TSB1: £2000, TSB2: £2000, Nationwide: £2500, Tesco: £0, Lloyds: £5000 Total: £10500) 

By which time, you'll be ready to flee the country with a healthy stash of interest!

N.B You most likely don't need to wait until the next day to transfer funds around and you might lose a bit of interest by doing so, but I prefer to play it safe.

Alternatively, just open a Santander account that pays 3% on balances between £3,000 and £20,000 and put everything in there.

And the script was actually pretty good i thought. I enjoyed all of the dialogue throughout, thought that the episode's entire premise of going deep inside a Dalek was amazing and i enjoyed the small segments that hinted at future storylines (Missy and Pink). Also i was very happy with the overall tone. It felt dark and mature (with lines like ""You're a good Dalek Doctor""). The aspects younger viewers enjoy were still present, but they were woven in well with the rest of it and were actually enjoyable as a result.

We went out there and did well the first half. One bullshit penalty later and instead of continuing the press we default back to AVB-style play. Embarrassing.

* Sterling stole the show. Imagine if he got that one where he ran across the defence? World's most exciting teenager.

* Defence as a complete unit isn't perfect. Perhaps it was made to look a bit better this match thanks to Spurs' lack of direction in attack. Some of that evident earlier on.

EDIT: I feel I might be harsh here, I mean Sakho and Lovren enjoyed good games. I've never been entirely sold on Sakho but if he keeps improving like this I'll be a bit more sold.

Ade looked dreadful today, he drags the CB's around but his work-rate wasn't up to snuff, he couldn't get his feet sorted, and he missed a lot of openings that he could've exploited (passes and shots). i'm still not sold on Kaboul and not too sure why he was given the armband today, i guess Poch isn't sure about giving it to the keep. Eriksen looked a yard off the pace today, but that's okay because we all know what he can do. Lamela and Chadli looked good but not great, i guess everyone kinda struggled to settle in. 

everyone but Capoue that is. i'm really loving this man, he tackles, he drops back, and he makes great passes. really happy we held on to him and that he's settled right in. Dier and Rose looked good too but there were moments where the youth was evident; Dier for the penalty (i'm not even gonna talk about it my blood is still boiling), and Rose was caught out of position a few too many times for my liking.

The lads that do the match threads always do a great job but today it reminded me a bit of those girls that always end up crying in the street when they get drunk.

As for the game itself, we were okay. Not bad, not good. They played their first team in a system they're used to that destroyed the league last year. We've a new manager who is teaching the team a new system. We've got a defender in Kaboul who's likely on his way out and a 20 year old CB playing at RB in his third ever Premier League game. Their first goal we were definitely at fault for. The second was the softest penalty I've seen in a while, and other decisions went against us too. The third goal was 100% on Townsend. The scoreline doesn't always tell the full story of the game and the teams involved.

What's encouraging is that we kept attacking and trying to score until the last minute. We made chances that unfortunately we didn't bury, which we will need to improve.

We're a work in progress. This loss is okay. Tottenham are doing okay. We will lose to teams like QPR and Leicester and Villa at points, and so will the top 4 teams. It's football. Everything's okay. Let's go cheer on Leicester now.

true,Shaolin76,english,Wirral,"They can't evict you without going through the courts lodging notice to evict by way of a *section 8* or a *section 21*

Just get in touch with the lettings agent and tell them to go get a section 8 or section 21. Tell them, until you have a court grant either of these you will not be moving. This will give you enough time to make alternate arrangements. It takes about 8 weeks to get through the courts system to gain possession of a property (fast tracked).

Also, they should give you written notice which legally they have to note the time and date you received it. I'm assuming they haven't done this yet?

Also most AST's (Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement) have a rolling clause such that at the end of the agreement it is understood the agreement is still in effect but reevaluated every x intervals (usually 3 months).

Given that property company A isn't employed by the landlady anymore, you could always call them first thing tomorrow as well and confirm your rights. They will probably have no objection to informing you of your rights since they have no vested interest in the property any more.

You could also call the landlady herself now if you have her number and inform her of company B's underhanded tactics. Tell her the property will be vacant by Wednesday or alternatively she can go through the courts. Make sure you are civil and polite with her though as this will be more effective than kicking off.

**Do NOT open the door tomorrow and keep the lock on the snip. Speak to the agent through the letterbox if necessary and inform them you are calling the police if they try to gain entry forceably, this would be trespass as they have not met their responsibilities in giving you notice to evict. This is a civil matter and the police can't assist in your eviction without a mandate from the courts to do so, so just stay put until you can move out on your time scale, or tell the lettings agent they can have the property in a week or 2, their alternative is to go through a costly (approx £1000) and time consuming process to evict you legally**

**Call the police on the non emergency number now to confirm all of the above if you like! I.e. It being a civil matter, they can't do anything without a court order**

1. I totally agreed with our starting eleven and would not have gone back and changed it. Our main issue in the opening half was nervousness amongst our players. Our back four made a lot of errors and conceded early. Our attacking players were not bold enough.

2. Despite being 1-0 down in the first half. I feel this was when we were strongest. I'm sure both sides' fans felt Spurs were likely to score going into the second half, so it's a shame that a weak penalty killed our momentum.

3. Subs were a legitimate issue. Dembele has been our weakest defensive midfielder and yet was the only one available to come on. I can understand Sandro not being available due to his rumoured sale, but where the FUCK was Paulinho? He played very strongly in the Europa league last Thursday and would have been the ideal replacement for Bentaleb.

4. Another sub issue. We go two nil down, no worries. It's early in the second half and we've still been looking good. Eriksen was poor in first half and didn't complement Lamela or Chadli in a way we'd like. No worries, this is when it's time to bring on the super eager Holtby! So what the fuck do we do? Andros fucking Townsend, who contributes to the third Liverpool goal.

* I believe the root cause of our problems is Adebayor up front. He is lazy, selfish and often out of position. Evident during the game when he took the ball away from Chadli, ran into a dead end and then laid the ball off to Chadli. After doing this he stood their like a proverbial lemon and didn't even make an effort to get into the box. Furthermore, he is incapable of holding up the ball and linking up play, even though he is obviously a pretty big bloke.

* Secondly, Eriksen has not has a good start to the season. Now this isn't a direct cause of our problems today. However, if he isn't having a good game and is taken off like today we lack any creativity going forward. Hence, why we stand around on the edge of the box very much like watching the English national team.

* Thirdly, Kaboul is simply not good enough. He makes to many mistakes and is a constant liability. Bring on Fazio, Chiriches or Dier with Jan at centre back.

* Fourthly, unusually today Lloris's distribution today was poor.

1) is an option, if we wanted to join the Euro. Others outwith the EU have adopted the Euro wholescale without permission also (see Monaco, San Marino, Vatican, Andorra, Kosovo, Montenegro)

2) Aye, I personally doubt they'll get there, but they've said they'll join. No one is forcing them, they're wanting to :P Lithuania have a date. 

3) Scotland might fail some of the indicators too. Depending on the size of the national debt it takes on and such.. The Scottish people would be the same as the Polish folk and not really be up for voting for such a change in a referendum. 

4) Yup. And the EU can't force them. It remains voluntary and will be voluntary without a treaty change. Can you imagine we're due another one so soon? With all the problems going on? With folk like the UK bitching from the sidelines? Can't see that happening... 

&gt; ""Salmond would get away with not doing it""

PLEEEEEEEEEEEEASE stop this. This isn't about Salmond, this isn't about the SNP. This is about future governments from whatever party. You're right that *Scotland* could sign up and refuse to join ERM II. As you say yourself ""If we keep the pound, it becomes a very complex negotiation indeed"" - if we are in a currency union and can't set our own interest rates, then we can't join the ERM II, and as such, could not technically ever join the Euro ;-) 

&gt; ""and I have no idea if the EU would let that slide""

I don't think they'd particularly care what currency we used? 

&gt; I would point out that *every single one* of the countries you mention has repeatedly promised to join the eurozone.

Sweden haven't, from what I've seen? 

In the end, I actually favour the adoption of the Euro, I'm an ardent europhile and would rather see us, Ireland and the rest of the UK all adopting the Euro and joining Schengen. It's not a popular position though... Currently though, being a pragmatist, using the pound with or without permission is best, as it would mean that our businesses could carry on as is.

We see so many soldiers on that base it's ridiculous to suggest that not one of them, at any point, put up there hand and said: 

""Hey guys, you know how we're trusting this dalek based entirely on it's word that it's now good and wants to help us? Do you think it's possible that that might be a lie and it might just turn on us at some point and start killing us and call all the other daleks here to start killing us? No? Well, do you think we should at least, I don't know, take it's gun away? Or lock the door? Or put it near an airlock? Or strap an explosive to it? Just something in case it tries to kill us? I'm worrying because I don't want to die. Oh fine, whatever, you're right, it'll probably be fine"". 

See my point? Such a huge lapse in judgement by every single person on that station is ludicrous, and it makes the daleks sudden turn to evil and escape seem especially unearned and even amusing because everybody just starts panicking like ""How could this happen!? There was no way to foresee this possibility and absolutely nothing we could do to save our entire crew now.""

Balotelli: Everyone was waiting for this debut. Strong overall, if he realizes he can rely on his teammates will come good quickly. Tried to do too much himself and overextended.

Studge: didn't score but great runs and his footwork never ceases to amaze. He needs a goal soon but I'm not worried.

Defense: first things first: MORENO WAS A STEAL. DAT goal. More than that though constantly mobile will be vital to giving us the width we've been missing for so long.

The defense recovered well from mistakes today. That is huge, last season we were 1st/2nd in individual errors leading to goals. Lovren was immense in the ability to recover and our fullbacks weren't really left exposed.

This is a very encouraging game overall. Beating Spurs away and doing while denying them much offense is a good sign for our return to the Champion's league. If the pieces stay like this well challenge for the title again.

It's the loyalists that gave Irish nationalism it's widespread legitimacy.

I bought a 18 year old 285000km truck for $1200, but that had been kept in great condition, that is still going another 15000km later with no major issues.  However, there were many minor ones, just from its age, that meant constant small costs came up.  Not enough to make it a bad investment, but the risk of something major going is always there.

It fit my situation at the time, but isn't something I would recommend.

My family generally buys a lightly used car from a dealership, less than 10,000 miles on it.  You get the discount of it not being 'new', a guarantee from where you bought it, and a low risk of any impending problems.

A friend essentially rents a car, paying a certain amount per month with the option to buy outright at the end of 2 years, or to start again with another car.  All servicing included etc.  Dead money in some ways, but no risk of any service costs if something fails in the car.  And a literally brand new one every couple of years, which he prefers to buying outright.

Any of those are good options, really just depends on your situation.

Moreno's goal got me really pumped up, watching him I never knew what to expect, breath of fresh air compared to Johnson's runs.

Sakho seems a bit out of form, he used to be our best passer although awkward looking in his stance but today he misplaced quite a few simple passes, luckily it didn't come to bite us back and we kept a clean sheet.
 
Gerrard didn't have the best of games, some suggest he played injured so we couldn't expect him to play perfectly, regardless he did what he can do best in scoring the penalty and we have to thank him for this; I hope he can bounce back next game and regain the form he had at the end of last season. 

Allen seemed a bit spent first half, I think we overrate him a fair bit on this sub but hopefully this was just a single poor game because we've seen him play much better in the past.

Henderson is a machine, I really hope he becomes our future captain and keeps up with his consistent excellent performances.

Sterling might have very well been our best man on the pitch today, he really shines in this kind of formation where he can run all over the attack, top notch finish was his for the first goal; bit sad he missed after his solo run across Spur's defense but still impressive game from him.

Sturridge displayed incredible foot quickness but his shooting was a bit off today, can't wait to see those curly shots of his going in and making us celebrate.

Balotelli was good for his first game in a while, he was a bit rusty on his finishing but he showed glances of his genius and his excellent positioning, also great work rate from the lad both pressing and coming back to defend all over the pitch, can see a bright season for him.

 Dier, out of position, against a very good team and in only his 3rd pl game understandably struggled. Kabouls looked poor but he did play on Thursday (when I believe he should have been rested for today). Cms looked quite bad but I'm not sure that bent/cap will be our first choice going forward. 

What annoys me however is the performances of eriksen and vertonghen. These two are supposedly two of our most talented players and I feel like they shy away from big, tough games. I wanted more from them today and tbh they let me down.

 Also I think it's time for Davies to start. Rose didn't have a howler or anything but I just don't think he is good enough to play left back for spurs. Suspect defensively and bang average going forward. Also he has zero ariel presence which is necessary for all defenders.

true,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat  | /r/LibDem,"Welcome! 

Thanks for expressing this in the terms you have. It's so much more polite and constructive than the sort of thing we see on the other place at the moment.

But, as to your point. 

&gt;Some on the Left need to do some introspection on matters of cultural relativism and the damaging and oppressive outcome of unquestioning ideological promotion of a communalist form of identity politics (multiculturalism).

&gt;[The] key phrase in the above statement being ""unquestioning ideological promotion"" don't you find yourself doing that a lot of late?

&gt;At the moment the migrants in our society are actively encouraged to organise around exclusive religious identities, and religious bodies are encouraged to take over spaces once occupied by progressive secular groups and, indeed, by a secular welfare state. You see this via government funding to ""local community leaders""

I agree wholeheartedly that the deference to ""community leaders"" we've seen over recent years is an objectionable position for the state and establishment to take. It's made particularly problematic when these self-styled ""leaders"" are acting on the behalf of an overwhelmingly male-dominated group- [this piece](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/rotherham-child-sexual-abuse-scandal--the-lessons-asian-womens-voices-go-unheard-9701622.html) touched on some of the things that have bothered me for a long time, for example. The observation that Labour activists (and, indeed, political activists in general) in areas with high proportions of immigrants from conservative, patriarchal cultures seem to have a disproportionate tendency to be overwhelmingly male is something that's always made me feel extremely uncomfortable about the situation. 

By going through pre-existing structures that have emerged within the ""community"", the state risks becoming an enabler of discriminatory, oppressive structures, rather than an impartial agent of social mobility, treating all citizens as equals. 

Though the situation in that regard isn't anywhere near as bad as the more hysterical tabloids are fond of suggesting, excessive respect and adherence to ""community"" structures is part of what can enable things like this sorry business to come about. I don't think it's a good thing- the state ought to be a power that permits people to act as individuals, and permit the formation of communities *without official recognition of them in a manner that affects its ability to do its duty*.

**That said**. 

This state of affairs doesn't in itself lead to cases like Rotherham. The argument that's been coming from the Right of late's centred solely upon the notion of ""political correctness""- I obviously don't speak for some kind of monolithic left-wing bloc of opinion, but I think the sight of this is absolutely appalling- and verges upon exploitation of the poor girls' case for the sake of scoring political points.

The conduct of the officials concerned is reprehensible. Charitably, they should be strongly reprimanded. Justly, they should lose their jobs on the spot. 

But this isn't an issue with ""political correctness"" as a concept. The idea itself, properly applied, does *not* necessitate such craven negligence as was shown by the council and police. This is, trite though the phrase is, ""political correctness gone mad""- these people weren't concerned with the idea itself, or the social background of its implementation- they were concerned with doing absolutely nothing that could possibly risk them losing their jobs. 

Bearing political correctness in mind does *not* necessitate permitting outrages like this to continue for such extended periods. ""Community cohesion"" was given overwhelmingly too much weight, and, crucially, *any decent person aware of the situation in a position to act ought to have known that at the time*. 

The problem, as far as I'm concerned, doesn't lie with the idea of political correctness (which, frankly, shouldn't be all that controversial at all. It's what people used to call ""prudence and decency"", in less hysterical times), but with the implementation. 

The tabloid dogwhistling we've seen from certain users in the other place is primarily concerned with screaming from the rooftops about the British Pakistani community as a whole- this is the element of /r/ukpolitics' favourite demagogues' conduct over the past week that I find the most unpleasant. 

The tendency to blame the spectre of mass immigration for the crimes? Demonstrably absurd, and, if not unadulterated National Front, then at least a fellow traveller. The tendency to scream bloody murder about yet another ""conspiracy to import Labour voters""? Both irrelevant, and, as with the prior point, thoroughly unpleasant. The endless, exhausting, **bolded for emphasis** tirades about lefties ""defending child rapists""? Disgusting, offensive, and utterly unrepresentative. You'd have to dig *extremely* deep to find anybody repugnant enough to defend the perpetrators of these crimes. 

They are, unfortunately, representative of a significant portion of the response to these events. I don't think that this is a constructive way to respond to this mess. 

The extent of the council and police force's systemic misconduct has been illuminated in horrible detail by the report. There should be consequences for that, and, I hope, another more comprehensive external inquiry into the place. Come the inevitable UKIP boost in the area in the next set of locals, change will certainly come to the area- if not necessarily the kind of change that will deal with the problem at its roots.

But there's precious little understanding being thrown about of *why* the attitudes that  led to this case, and those like it, are prevalent in Pakistani gangs in these areas, in particular. I'd prefer to read actual, professionally researched analyses of the social structures and peculiarities that allow things like this to occur, rather than leap onto the communal outrage bandwagon as so many have done. There are white rapists and paedophiles in abundance- but a comparative analysis of the circumstances behind this kind of case and the latter would be whole worlds more productive than simply leaping to the kind of communal tarring-and-feathering we're seeing now. 

Beyond that- what can, constructively speaking, *actually be done to stop this kind of thing happening*? It's all well and good to rail against the multiculturalism bogeyman- but cultural heterogenity *exists* in Britain, *right now*- soapboxing about the ""multicult"" tends to ignore that fact, and offers zero constructive alternatives beyond wooly ""back to the fifties"" rhetoric and, at worst, ""send them all back"". 

I don't feel qualified to comment on what reforms should be made in the Rotherham area or nationally. The problem seems to be far more complex than just organised rape gangs and criminally inept municipal goverment- hence, my preference for an external, preferably government-run review of the structural and systemic issues that led to this state of affairs.

true,Kididas,num23,,"The only positive we can take away is that we did not make **major** defensive mistakes like what we did last year. Even though in general I would say we were playing poor at the back. 

Kaboul shouldnt be starting today. He made several passing errors and could not contain neither balotelli nor sturridge. im sure his own goal was the reason why we were 1-0 down at our first minute at anfield last year. He **cannot** be our starter if hes making defensive mistakes like that in big games. 

Danny rose today reminded me why we wanted ben davies at the first place. He penetration at the flanks were simply not enough and he occasionally roams in the center. imo ben was more composed in the left back position today. 

Dier - bad luck. it was the softest penalty I have ever seen.
  
Can anyone explain why Eriksen was subbed off for Townsend? We needed direct plays and he was exactly what we needed. I blame townsend for the third goal.. Im sure we would have kept the ball if that was lamela on the ball. 

Ade - stop running into offside positions.

In general I thought the team lacked passion in our game. There was a lack of belief when we were down and whenever we gained momentum, we conceded a goal. Some might say we were unlucky but I would say we need a strong mentality to comeback in big games like this. 

looking forward to seeing what poch can do to change this.

&gt;  don't like your ""who have gone out and done well for themselves"" comment as it's a bit misleading; that's something you might say about an entrepreneur not someone in five years of university and straight into a job.

I'm a little confused here by what you're saying.  
Are you saying that Doctors are not going out and doing well for themselves? 

My view would be that getting into those tailor-made course takes years of hard work alone.  Anyone who can get into that is doing well already.

Regardless of where someone's pay starts, taken into the context of earnings over the course of a career, a few years of low pay is more than compensated for by the many many years of fantastic pay.  Even more if they do private work... again the definition of doing well for themselves.

I don't think that the supply of trained personnel and tailor-made course makes it something easy. 


But can you just confirm the following:
 
Exactly what you're getting at here? do you consider 22k to be a LOT of money for the role?  or are you saying its not doing well? or IS doing well.

Do they have to be getting millions a year before you'd consider it good?

For everyone who was expecting us to go on the rampage after QPR last week, it is best to remember we were playing arguably the best side in the league last year and definite title challengers this year. 

* The big takeaway is we are a work in progress.
*  If Ade had put away that chip early on or Chadli placed his shot better before half time it would have been a completely different game. 
* That penalty put us away. 
* We didn't completely give up like last year. Yes we were ineffective going forward but we tried and that gives me a bit of hope.  
* Our defence is still shaky, Kaboul is a worry and Fazio couldn't come sooner. I really really really like Dier but god knows having Walker back would be incredible.

The biggest worry is our front 4 struggled, the movement and  creativity we saw against QPR wasn't there. Part of that was because we were up against a midfield and defence who press as well so they didn't get the time to do as they pleased. We may have to tweak how we approach top sides who will put us under as much if not more pressure than we attempt to do to them.

I am still optimistic. We have a fantastic manager, a big talented squad and its a long season.

He has already gone twice through open-skull surgery, and the tumour has grown again each time. Proton beam therapy has also been considered for his case, but finally it seems that a third surgery will be a better option.

The downside of proton beam therapy is that because it is extremely expensive and involves huge investment in equipment, there's a possibility that those very few hospitals that practice it ""oversell"" it.

The major mistake could have easily lead to a goal, when both lovren and sakho went for the same ball, both missed it and bentaleb went through. Shows that the communication is still not quite up to par. Also Sakho fucked up a couple of simple passes that could have cost us. Lovren made some great tackles during the game. Of course we looked better in the second half when we got the cushion Spurs pressed a lot less and we looked more comfortable on the ball. I think if we hadnt of had that goal margin we would have been in for a typically nervy finish.

I count Gerrard as part of the defense, his distribution is usually excellent but today it was shocking just [look at all the failed long balls](http://i.imgur.com/JRhP2Af.png). However positionally he was v good. 3 out of 3 tackles, 8 clearances and 3 blocks. 

When our defense gets set with that wall of 4 and three in front we are tough to break down. Allen and Henderson tucked in nicely covering the channels in between the fb and cb that silva and nasri exploited last week. Tottenhams only option when we got set was to pass the ball out wide and cross it in. Eriksen was invisible for most of the game highlighting the great job hendo, allen and gerrard were doing.

The main positive is that i think we have fullbacks boxed off right now. Moreno and Manquillo look v solid, cant believe their ages.

true,dead3ye,lfc99,,"Sterling obviously once again was one of our best. We keep repeating it, but he is still so young and has so much room for improvement - its scary!

Sturridge and Balotelli are going to rain goals once they get their shooting right, both did great work today even without scoring which shows great promise.

Hendo and Allen had a really strong game, both ran their hearts out and contributed with some nice runs. It's great to see Allen get stuck into the bigger guys on the pitch!

Stevie, we all know, had a bit of an off game with his passing. Scored a great penalty though and did some solid defending which shouldn't be overlooked. Like I said before, he normally takes time to get into full swing (he has for a few seasons now) and he will get there for us yet.

Mignolet had a pretty solid game, good save by Chadli but still seems a bit unwilling to come out to control his area. Still, he's showing improvements so lets hope that continues.

Sahko was obviously a bit nervous to start, we shouldn't be surprised as he started the same for us last season. I do think he grew into the game as it went on especially in the second half. The same could be said about Lovren, he gave me a few heart attack moments but I believe that him and Sahko will become a really solid partnership (they NEED to get more game time together).

true,jonasbro,null,null,"Rose and Lamela looked as if they were following a gameplan. They played with high intensity all game and tried to press as they could. 

Rose was never caught out like he was last season, the only times they got up the right flank was when he had bombed forward and didnt get support or the attack was botched somewhere along the way. He was caught out 2 times against Balo in the 6 yard box, but only due to his size, he was covering for Verts both times. 

What is really frustrating to me is that Liverpool are playing the pressing game that we were led to believe Poch is known for. There are players on the team that just do not seem to be able to muster the work rate it takes to press from the front.

The reason that Capoue and Bentaleb were not that visible is maybe that Liverpool goes up the flanks.

My problem with what you say is that political correctness is an incredibly ambiguous phrase.  It's like the word 'ideological' that Labour were throwing around after the Coalition came to power - it means whatever the user wants it to mean.

For some, 'political correctness' just means being aware that some people have a different cultural background.  Some people think 'political correctness' means being prevented from telling racially off-colour jokes in public.

The Rotherham incident seems to have been caused by a failure of the authorities to properly investigate claims, particularly as the perpetrators seem mostly to have been from a certain ethnic background.  This is obviously wrong and steps should be taken to make sure that they are accountable for this failure.

But does that mean we should use this as a stick to make generalisation about all muslims, or all Pakistanis?  Or post innumerable numbers of threads focussing on these people's religion?

true,flaps16,lfcflame,,"I really think we did well. Sakho/Lovren seems like a better partnership than Lovren/Skrtel. I think we  got a little to many yellows compared to where we was at the game. 

THe card to Allen was absolutely deserved pulling etc, even though it was good he did. Yellow card is fine in this situation. 

The yellow for Manquillo was deserved for a very late tackle, which was somewhat unnecessary.

I'd say the last two Sterling and Moreno were well deserved, but both were imo absolutely unnecessary.


After Last match I was left thinking we played ALOT better after we shifted formation to 4-4-2 diamond. today we started like that and we clearly did better in the first ~60 minutes when we played like this.

I think our new signings did very well. Balotelli obviously should have had one or two in the net. Markovic was somewhat more invisible contrary to the city game in which we trailed. He did fine defensively though. I fell like Manquillo is better than Johnson, like the popular subreddit belief - I like to see him and Scouse Cafu fight for the RB position whole Enrique and Moreno fight for the LB position, where I feel Moreno is preffered at this moment. The Moreno goal was fantastic for us, and absolutely humiliating for Spurs, I mean why was he allowed to run so far without anyone ever coming across although I am happy on how it ended. Can did solid in defence when he came on, seemed a little bit more invisible offensively. The penalty had obvious contact and there is no doubt a penalty can be given, but he seemed like he did fall a wee bit lightly but then again this doesn't seem to be something only Allen or any other Liverpool player could do... It's everyone. Sturridge is obviously having a hard time finding the goal even if he keeps searching for it.

Stevie was good defensively and had some good passes but also did miss a few - alot fewer than in the city game though.

Mignolet apart from the first couple of chances played a solid game.

All in all, I feel like the team is doing better and better and I certainly feel like we can be in the title race again this season.

I still feel we need a goalkeeper at Mignolets level or slightly better to keep them pushing eachother for the 1st team which is best for both of them, even if one only gets time in against low teams in the league and the FA Cup / Capital One cup.",0,1409498846,null,0,false,0,ck5gieq,t3_2f30zb,t1_ck5gieq,t3_2f30zb,null,1427269474,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Running at full sprint shoulder to shoulder with a guy? No problem.  Slight contact in the box?  Legs lock up and you fall forward. 

 I think Dowd's view was slightly blocked (watch the replay there is a spurs player in between the ref and the foul) off from a player and saw the reach and thought there was more in it.

Anyone can see that a hand sliding across his chest, no not clutching or grabbing or pulling back, but sliding, would not cause his legs to buckle from underneath him.

The extreme ""he's laughably shit"" attitude is what I'm saying is so wrong it deserves its own category of wrongitude.

The fault with that defence at the minute, obviously so in the first half, is communication and anticipation.  The players don't know what to expect from the other members of the defence and that understanding will only come with time.  

I saw some of what you're highlighting wrt Sahko in the first half, but Lovren did the same to a lesser degree and we have to consider that Hendo was in front of Lovren and Allen (who had a stinker imho) was in front of Sahko.  The second half, they were already seeming to gel a lot better - but that's easier when you're 3-0 up - and the midfield cover seemed to increase massively when Allen went off.

true,RedSquaree,,Belfast,"&gt; Actually most people who've worked in a bank generally have done at least one degree, generally a masters too. Yet they're vilified by the general population and the media/politicians as they're an easy target.

I don't know if you're deliberately trying to not understand the difference between doing a degree and ending up in banking, and entering a degree knowing you will have a guaranteed job starting on at least £22,000 from as young as 22.

&gt;Starting on 22k, probably yeah actually

Not probably, that's the minimum salary for a FY1 doctor.

&gt; Are you saying that Doctors are not going out and doing well for themselves? 

This part doesn't matter, it's a discussion about language. To me that's how you describe someone, as I said, such as an entrepreneur or someone who went out, started small and worked their way up. I think leaving 6th year, entering a five year tailor-made degree with the knowledge you'll have a guaranteed job with a fantastic starting salary for the typical age isn't quite ""going out"". It's merely entering a process where the only outcome is a good job.

&gt;My view would be that getting into those tailor-made course takes years of hard work alone

Schools have this down to a T. Take Methody for example, they groom their pupils to be doctors practically, getting kids into voluntary work early for example. As for succeeding in standardised tests, well that depends on how smart you are largely. If you're the type of person who isn't booksmart and you truly had to work your hole off to get an A then you are unlikely to make it through to becoming a doctor without tearing your brains out!

&gt;do you consider 22k to be a LOT of money for the role?

For someone doing no overtime, typically aged 22 or 23, yes that is a lot of money. Consider the job market at the moment. Few professions (though IT is a big one here) start on that salary. However, most of those other professions aren't paid for by taxes. Private companies can do whatever the hell they want! Good for them paying such good wages to graduates! In fact, a bit more of that spread across professions would be awesome. I digress, £22k is the minimum. Within two years this person can be earning over £22k *after tax*. Jeez Louise. 

&gt;Do they have to be getting millions a year before you'd consider it good?

I think you misunderstood my previous post.

&gt;I've just realised that you think 22k is a lot of money. Holy fuck, man you're dreaming.

I already talked about IT before I read this part. They're private companies, they can do what they want.

It's not only an adjustment time for the players, but for the new manager as well. He's still learning what to do and what not to do with his new players in different situations. You might be able to call this a good loss. Lots to learn from it.

Also Dembele was not a bright spot LOL. Neither was Ade. His hold up play was good as always and he looked vibrant when in possession, but he held it too long, doesn't seem to grasp the meaning of offside yet (never has really) and never made any good runs into danger areas. To be fair, when he was wide, his teammates never did the same for him either.

What happened to Townsend is unfair as well. He's had literally 5 seconds to get up to the match pace that Moreno has been flying at for 50+ minutes. And it was a fantastic goal. We can bitch about no one being able to get over to close him down, but it's because he was running so fast! It's not that we couldn't close him down because we're shit, we couldn't close him down because he was unstoppable.

Also I love Dembele and Ade fwiw. I think Dembele is a monster at times, I just wish he had more technical skill and were a better passer. I think Ade is enigmatic and someone who truly knows how to win in the BPL, has great talent and creative vision, he just seems to lack the ability to create goals for himself. He's always offside in vital moments, he never has ""that touch"" that opens up the defense allowing a clear shot on goal, he doesn't consistently make runs to the far post, he doesn't truly act as a target man even though he's clearly built like one.

true,arctic9-5,null,null,"&gt;How does this compare to the UK system?
Thankfully most of us only have to do a single subject. However, some Uni's operate a point system. Each course is worth a certain number of points, and if you don't reach the maximum with that one course, you need to take a second, smaller course. 

For example, Medicine, Physics and Maths degrees will normally give you 100% of the points.

Less intensive degrees such as Geography will give you around 80%, and you have to pick another course to get the extra 20%. These ""other courses"" are very specific in nature, and they have a relatively small workload.

You may also have lectures with students doing other courses, because the subjects will cross over. For example, maths students and geography students may be in the same lecture for statistics, since both subjects require learning in statistics.

You go for between 3 and 7 years; most courses are 3 years long. Many people do a ""year in industry"" where they will go to a company relevant to their degree and work with them for a year. Medicine degrees take around 7 years, some of which you will spend in hospitals and clinics gaining experience.

&gt;What are some common ways to get to know other people while you're in university?
We do ""freshers week"", which I believe we stole from you. Essentially, the first-years spend a week getting drunk/going to events before term begins.

Throughout the year there are hundreds of societies to join, ranging from the relatively famous ""Assassin's Societies"" to film-making societies. Most students I believe join at least one society, though I ~~think~~ students can join more than one at a time.

Students can also apply to make their own societies. (A bit like a subreddit, I guess)

The subjects themselves will also organise social events for everyone doing that subject.

Don't forget that students begin at 18 (or 19) so therefore everyone is legally allowed to buy and consume alcohol, which is different to the US. 

&gt;ethnic clubs

I don't think there's a massive emphasis on ethnicity, but I can't be sure. I'm fairly sure there are religious societies.

&gt;I think you have casual sports at university

Yes, but there's also national competitions in things like swimming and football (British Football / Soccer)

We also have student unions, which organise student events and freshers week. They are also the go-to-guys for making your own society.

At the risk of sounding Islamophobic, I think Islamic culture represses sexuality in a lot of Muslim men. The way their women dress to cover their hair and body, if not their face, and that men have to marry to have sex (which makes it almost impossible for low income men without financial assets to do), creates a subculture of sexually frustrated Muslim men with no other opportunity to procreate and contemptuous of non-Muslim women.

They probably know what they're doing is despicable, but are angry and frustrated that non-Muslim men seem to get all the girls, and probably justify it in their minds by believing that non-Muslims have no morals anyway. So long as they don't harm Muslim (moral) girls, they believe there's no harm in it.

It's sick, but it's also tragic. When you look at Muslim history, and their relentless Jihad-ing, and even modern examples such as what ISIS is doing in Iraq and Boko Haram kidnapping schoolgirls in Nigeria, what you see is enormous numbers of destitute young Muslim men, denied wives (especially since in Muslim cultures wealthy men are able to marry multiple wives) who's only chance for sex and procreation is to invade and steal women from non-Muslims.

And it's in that context you start to understand why Muslim suicide bombers are so keen to die and go to Paradise, where there are 72 virgins waiting for them. These suicide bombers are all virgins themselves! Mid to late 20 year old men who may have never laid eyes on a naked woman before.

1. First ascertain if you do have a valid tenancy agreement by reading the agreement and finding the clause which states the contract rolls on every X months. Even so, they cant evict you without going through the courts, this is how squatters take residence of a property.
2. Don't let ANYONE in the house tomorrow
3. Call the landlady if possible and very politely tell her you'll be out on Wednesday, or alternatively they can start court proceedings which will take a couple of months.
4. Call the lettings agent (or speak to them through the letterbox and tell them the same).
5. Call CAB to confirm your rights
6. Find another house ASAP
7. Make sure someone is in the house at all times and the house is locked at all times - deadbolts, key in the door and bolts locked.

Police cant do anything to help agents of property company B or the landlady, this **INCLUDES BAILIFFS**. Police cant assist without a court order as this is a civil matter and not a criminal matter.

I think rooms like that are available in Britain, but not at my university and I don't know anybody who actually lived in one. I had a room with a single bed, a desk, a wardrobe and some shelves, about eight feet by fifteen, which is more or less the norm. Some of course will be bigger with en-suites and stuff but we didn't have them. In my little unit were seven rooms like that (mixed sex), and we shared two showers &amp; toilets, and a large kitchen. There were six such units in the building, so 42 people total. That's more or less typical, but often it will be tower blocks rather than halls like mine, with about 10-20 people per floor and up to 20 floors. My university actually had both, a few towers on campus and a set of buildings like mine in a dedicated student village an hour's walk from the university, but with a shuttle bus. In the village were about 2000 students (compared to roughly 500 on campus) in the same basic building, but some were bigger and some smaller, plus a shop and a pub. It was laid out roughly like any residential area and was next to one, but no 'normal' people lived there, in the summer it was totally empty. Internet and bills were all taken care of by the uni.

I'm not sure how it works in the US but that sort of accommodation (at least at my university) was only for first years and after that, people moved into shared houses. These were normal houses, but converted for shared living, so each room has a locking door and its own desk etc. I lived in such a house with five other people, again sharing the kitchen and two bathrooms. My room there was about 2 or 3 times bigger than my dorm one, with a double bed and a sink. The house was in a normal residential area about 15 minute's walk from the uni, but maybe a quarter or a third of the houses were for students, with the rest being normal families. That's run by private owners, not associated with the university, so we had to get a normal internet connection and pay our own bills etc. Again I think that's fairly typical in Britain, living in uni accommodation for your first year then going into a house for the rest.

Well, I've an eerily similar case in my family and he doesn't seem to be talking such shite, because after much consideration, reading up literature **and** talking to doctors, these relatives of mine also initially came to the conclusion that proton beam therapy was the least bad option. And *their* doctors agreed.

Let it be clear: the lasting side effects of radiotherapy on brain tumours in young children are pretty horrible. The advantage of proton beam therapy over X-Ray radiotherapy is that, by targeting the tumour more closely, it can cause less damage to the still-growing infant brain. But it isn't a panacea (and it's very expensive).

In my young relative's case, when everything was ready for the therapy, it finally turned out that good old-fashioned surgery had a better potential, with less risk than proton-beam therapy.

true,MrJohz,null,null,"Missy *cannot* be the Rani.  It would be unlikely for Missy to be any Time Lord unless they can explain how she escaped the pocket universe prior to the previous two episodes.

What we know about Missy is that she *loves* the Doctor.  Not just loves him in a River Song way, but passionately adores him.  She's his number one fangirl.  She thinks he's amazing.  If anything, she tends to creepy rather than lovely.  At least, that's the impressions she's been painting thus far.

That immediately discounts the Rani unless she's been bonked on the head a few too many times.  The Rani does not love the Doctor.  The Rani's main thought of the Doctor would be more along the lines of him getting in the way of her plans.  She is not about to fall madly in love with this man.

It also removes River from the equation (thankfully).  River loves the Doctor, yes, but doesn't create a creepy heaven shrine to those he couldn't save shit there's a thought, forget this train of thought, these are all significant characters that shit - they gave their lives!  Every character so far has given their lives to the Doctor or for the Doctor or in some way connected to the Doctor.  Well, the robot may or may not have given his life up, but that would fit more accurately, would it not?

Why would anyone who claims to love the Doctor so rescue these people?  We're going to have an army theme, right?  In a war, people are going to give their lives for the cause - but we already did that theme in those truly awful bee/star/dalek/Donna episodes.  
Going by that, it *could* be some sort of twisted sick enemy of the Doctor making a point about how people love the Doctor enough to die for him - he doesn't need to fight he has people he sends to fight - but that is too easy and has been done before, that makes no sense.

Someone loves the Doctor and collects those who die to save him - to congratulate them?  To save them for the Doctor to thank properly at a later date?  But the robot (if he did die willingly) didn't die for the Doctor's sake, did he?  The bloke who got vapourised last episode can be discounted, he didn't realise he was going to die, and was just a pawn in the Doctor's hands anyway.

That's the limits of my thoughts, can anyone else continue making sense?

A guaranteed job as a trainee doctor.. at 22? I'd question the age but okay, what's your point?  Are you saying we should pay them less because its a guaranteed job?

What about midwives, lots of training but no guaranteed job at the end.. should that mean we pay them more because they may not get a job?  Or Dentists.

I would imagine that when a doctor actually becomes useful ie not FY1 they're worth more and paid accordingly.  btw 22k is not a fantastic salary for anyone with a degree.  for comparison, JP Morgan, UBS etc pay 43k for their interns and grads.

&gt;  To me that's how you describe someone, as I said, such as an entrepreneur or someone who went out, started small and worked their way up.

Stinks of petty Jealousy tbh.


&gt; Schools have this down to a T. Take Methody for example, they groom their pupils to..

So you're saying methody are equipping their pupils with the skills needed to follow their chosen career.  Isn't that a good thing? Shouldn't all schools provide that to their pupils?  Shit maybe they even help the pupils apply for uni too.  


&gt; however, most of those other professions aren't paid for by taxes.

so anyone doing IT in the civil service should be an indentured slave and not paid anything by your thinking?




Here is the thing....

Aside from sounding like a jealous child, you're just plain wrong.  They're not paying someone 22k because they are young, they're not paying them 22k first off because they have got some sort of golden ticket or because they worked hard.  

They're paying them 22k because its commensurate with their position, Doctors need to be seen as the source of authority and confidence within the medical system, they need to be seen to be 'better' than the nurses, so they're paid 22k to start off, its a training wage really because they need years of experience before they're let loose on a person.  Would it scare you if your airline pilots were minimum wage earners?

They're also paid relatively well in NI because they will be in charge of peoples lives. Ever wonder why a gas engineer coming to your house charges so much? Because he can lose his livelihood from one single mistake, same for a doctor only with worse consequences.  

But even more, expand your horizons some more, these people are highly educated, clearly highly motivated and probably ambitious, easyjet flights are cheap.. put that together and you have highly mobile, highly skilled workforce, what does this mean? it means they can jolly well go to wherever pays best.  Just like every other career.

I don't know about you, but I do not want to entrust my life to Dr Nick Riviera or someone who might miss some vital clue.  So it is everywhere else in the world, health is worth paying for and worth maintaining a world class service.

But since last season ( especially after losing RVP and handling the big injury list ) he is pushing the money to get players who can stabilise the squad and help him retain old players. This way making sure that the trophies are not just close but possibly a win.

On the other hand Chelsea always had been buying players without really being bothering about the business aspect of course not being crazy but willing to spend, precisely the reason Mourinho had to just slash a few players out and get a few to just strengthen the squad.

Now even if it was, give me a single example of this actually occurring without a court? What is written is irrelevant, the de facto position is that they don't do shit without a court investigation first. The reason is because they are completely open to legal ramifications, we're speaking of tens of thousands of pounds in damages, if not more. 

And, even if Universities did do this and risk the legal damages. It would still be morally wrong. Which was ultimately my original point.


Edit: I will add that the reason they are so legally liable is due to the legal status that Universities have as a (typically state-owned) chartered institution with obligations based around their state-issued Article of Governance.

true,Gorgash,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"As others have said you'd be offered Scottish citizenship but you'd be allowed to keep your UK citizenship too. If Scotland went independent then only future generations would be affected, since they'd only have Scottish citizenship. Say what you want about the UK but we have [one of the best passports in the world](http://www.movehub.com/sites/default/files/filemanager/passport-power-fixed.png). Maybe Scotland's passports would be equally as good if independence happens but dammit, I'm no passport expert!

If both Scotland and the UK remain in the EU then there would still be the same freedom of movement we have now. The only potential reason for any kind of border control would be in the scenario where Scotland was in the EU but the UK left. The UK has never been in the Schengen area and they would be concerned about people potentially (illegally) migrating to the UK via Scotland since it would be the only EU country to share a border. It's extremely unlikely that this scenario would happen... but with all the UKIP stuff going on and the Tories becoming more Eurosceptic to appeal to voters... you never know.

Other than these possibilities (which really aren't big deals - even with a hypothetical border control you'd be legally allowed to enter the UK) there really wouldn't be much of a difference.

The claim that authorities refuse to take action against non-white criminals for fear of being accused of racism is provably false. Fear of being branded a racist has not prevented:

* individuals from the Asian ethnic group from being 1.4 times more likely than those from the White ethnic group to be stopped and searched;

* individuals from the Mixed ethnic group from being 1.6 times more likely than those from the White ethnic group to be stopped and searched;

* individuals from the Black ethnic group from being 6 times more likely than those from the White ethnic group to be stopped and searched under section 1 powers;

* individuals from the Mixed ethnic group from being twice as likely as those from the White ethnic group to be stopped and searched under section 1 powers;

* individuals from the Black ethnic group from being nearly three times more likely as those from the White ethnic group to be arrested;

* individuals from the Mixed ethnic group from being twice as likely as those from the White ethnic group to be arrested;

Thought he would have been more beneficial for link ups and positiong around the 6 yard. Dier is young, solid not scared to lay a big tackle he will learn from his mistakes.
Moreno tanked us today looks like a good signing for them...sterling looked a class above.

Pochettino is still learning the squad hopefully he can create a solid an attacking defence with our new signings. We have a young defense with a lot of potential and time to grow together. 

They beat us 3 nil but they didn't dominate us at least now we have seen how we shape up to a strong squad and what we can change up and work on. I feel like we aren't getting the most out of Erikson atm hopefully we can find a fast and creative combination with capoue behind him as a true dm cleaning the mess and distributing to Erikson with lamela and chadli looking for a pass and moving into dangerous positions linking with soldado and finding him on through balls and low crosses.

Firstly, he is 2 year younger than Ba. Better for future retaining and maybe selling?

Remy creates more chances than Ba. And thats why has low shot accuracy but this also makes sure we have more chance of scoring from set pieces. Ba is great at pressing and score but he plays solo.

""downplay the ethnic dimensions""

not quite as provably false i fear....

it's being discussed alot because it has deeply troubling implications for our wider culture.

The perpetrators were almost exclusively Pakistani Muslim males, and the victims were almost exclusively white girls.
That does not mean that all Muslims or Pakistani's are paedophiles, obviously.
However it does mean that there is a specific problem in this area, and that race is playing a significant part, and people's unwillingness to face up to this fact for the sake of political sensitivity has directly resulted in more children being abused.

He claims it wasn't racist, as does the friend himself. I happen to believe them and not assume racism everywhere I look.

This has nothing to do with the culture within the armed forces. No it's own inherent racism.

I really do enjoy the compelling arguments that surround football and a lot of sports in general, though football seems to generate so much legitimate controversy. However, while it may sound traditionalist, when you bring in the FA to impose supreme judgement over a game they're not directed involved with unlike the refs they employ, you begin to take power out of the ref's hands. That very thing is happening in the NHL and NFL in America.

In ice hockey, fighting is allowed to give the players accountability for their actions. It's rarely malicious or personal and usually a business transaction of sorts - you took liberties being too physical with our star player so now I'm going to rustle his jimmies. There is now a new rule called the instigator rule which prohibits players from randomly starting fights, making fights extremely rare as opposed to 10-15 years ago. Maybe 5. This is designed to sell the game more to fans who don't appreciate fighting because it's... fighting. :/

So what happens now is players have to hide behind the refs and either hope they make the call or sell out/suck dick to make them make the right call (case in point: Sidney Crosby's entire existence in his first 3-5 years in the league (and ""coincidentally"" the ""new"" NHL with many of these crackdown-type rules) was for this purpose). More often than not, refs get the call wrong in some way, the NHL will sometimes go against what the refs call on the ice. [Here is the big turning point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIXcGOr4-04) in the ""headshot"" rule that became oh so popular right around that time.

Richards was not suspended on that play even though the rule was introduced something like days before that game. There seem to be many cases of players being ejected for clean hits that look dirty ([Kronwall v. Havlat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBmdIOPBWNw) is a classic example) or players throwing dirty or poor hits, aren't ejected, are merely penalized while an injury occurs on the play and the NHL later suspends them. As a result, there is some credibility lost between the refs and the NHL as a disciplinary league. No one really wins.

The FA will always remind us that the game is officiated by humans who make errant judgements from time to time. Humans are fallible! There is no way around this. Based on the amazing things humans can do and the high standards we hold ourselves to, however, it's very easy to forget this fact.

I'm not saying I don't approve of letting the FA be involved because there are certainly instances that are just plain WRONG that officials need to get right - they shouldn't have unanimous support EVERY time ALL the time (this would imply some amount of unhuman perfection from one group of humans as well) - just that you enter shaky ground when you have a set of refs for the set of refs.

Also we all know how hardcore traditionalist FIFA is -- took forever to get some form of goal line technology that's not another human. Plus that genius aerosol spray.

You need to earn patience.

To say Eriksen fades out of games at a high tempo is ridiculous. He played and excelled at Ajax for years, a club known for it's higher-tempo play. He also showed big against top clubs in the CL for Ajax. He just hasn't done so here. I'm sure you can put two and two together here - our team just hasn't clicked yet. Ajax had a squad that free up together and knew each other very well. We still haven't manager to get everyone on the same page, but we're getting there.

And the one player that can never seem to get on the same page as everyone else is Townsend. Sure, he might become a top player. He may be a world beater. But the chances of that are slim-to-none and we can't afford to keep playing him and forgo selling him for a fee that's good enough to get a winger from abroad.

We could have sold Townsend for 12 M or so and gotten Depay for 15 (going off rumors here). If that's the case we fucked up for not biting. Would have improved us massively.

I wasn't technically accurate when I said ""no rent at all"".

This is the only bloody time we didn't ask for a letter of guarantor since we had a 3 year relationship with his sister as a previous tenant.

Enter month 3....excuses which we accept since we have no reason not to believe otherwise.

Enter month 4...more excuses which we say is unacceptable

Enter month 5...ridiculous excuses. We say if he hasn't made any attempt to reduce the arrears this month we will start proceedings against him.

Enter month 6...we realise he has no intention of paying and is playing the system. We start proceedings

Enter month 7...still no rent and proceedings in the pipeline

Enter months 8...still no rent and we get the eviction notice


His parting gift was every wall and door damaged with punch marks and what I can only assume were head butt marks and a rather lovely turd on top of the cistern of each toilet.

We got the possession order from the court and also an order for us to recover the arrears and court costs but since he has no assets it's a moot point. We will not recover any of the money.

We all know Everton likes to use the flanks as they have attacking fullbacks(Baines/Coleman). Our wide players are going to do a lot of defending and have to cover each other. Two high energy midfielders who love a tackle in the middle, Mulumbu slightly deeper than Gardner.


We will have to soak up some pressure and hit them on the counter with pace (Ideye, Sessegnon, Varela, Berahino), Sess and Ideye will link up nicely. Ideye showed some good strength and he looked sharp against Swansea even though he was isolated because we were too deep plus the fact we were just shite.

At Ajax, they were far and away the most cultured team in Holland so they could speed up or a slow down as they please. Today Liverpool was at one gear, we were at another. That's how it's been in big games for Eriksen at Spurs this season and last. For such a talented player he should be able to control the tempo of the game better, and as our primary playmaker that is HIS responsibility IMO. This is not say he won't come good, I'm just pointing out Eriksen is the only player Spurs fans allow to skate by no matter the circumstance.

As for Townsend, I don't have a problem will selling him, especially when we had a chance to get Depay. But if he's at the club, there's no point in making him a scapegoat. When one player goes 60 yards across the pitch and scores, that can't be just one player's fault. He can contribute, and hopefully he can improve under Poch in the same way numerous Southampton players did.

For example, i want to make your run of the mill curry. Im gonna need

Chicken/Lamb which are fairly expensive from fresh. Substitute being frozen stuff

I need onions for the base of the sauce. This is fine as onions are hella cheap.

I probably need some some variation of cream or coconut cream, again this isn't too expensive.

Now i need spices. Im a student, do i own a spice rack? hell no i dont use enough spices to justify having 15 different kinds and not to mention they're all £2-4 each depending what i want. Now to note im going to need 4 or 5 different spices and possibly curry paste depending what im making.

So you put all this together and what do you get? A curry for 1 thats probably costing £10+ for a single portion (you cant buy a single chicken breast) and im gonna have a ton of things left over that can actually go off. Sure i COULD cook a batch that will do me the week but fuck me will i hate curry by the end of it.

Compare this to a ready made tikka masala, £1 sharwoods frozen from asda or £2 fresh, or i have the alternative of frozen chicken, a bottle of sauce and some microwave rice for about £3. Sure its full of salt, sat fat, hydrogenated fat and a butt ton of e-numbers but if its a choice between eating crap for 7 days or eating for 2 or 3 days i know what i would choose.

true,kde01,king,,"I really disagree about your assessment on the Dutch league and Eriksen at Ajax, as well as your assumption that he's only good when his side controls the game. That's a whole different discussion, though, and my thumbs can't take much more typing...

On the subject, I think Eriksen should be analyzed and criticized as much as any other one of our players but the fact that he was one of our best players last year remains. Townsend hasn't shown that hell ever come good, and players like Lennon and Kaboul have fallen backwards enough to warrant criticism as well. The fact is the better someone plays, the more you can forgive them for a performance or two every few months where they go missing.

But for someone that's missing or making mistakes every match you just wonder when we're going to get rid of him.

If the window closes and Townsend is still here I'll be behind him. But for now that the window is open I really just hope the club realizes he's nothing but a liability. Him, Kaboul, and Sandro should go. We can then reassess the squad over the next six months and make some more transfers in Jan. Reassess in the spring and fine tune during the summer.

It's going to take a while to get the right squad set up but if we don't start with getting rid of players who show they they're not at the level that we're trying to reach then where can we start from?

true,rosscatherall,eng-TyneWear,Zoocastle,"Fuck. 

talking about cleaners it brings me back to when we moved into our last house. The landlord hired a cleaner just to give it a going over as the carpets and plastering had just been done. So she turns up on the second day of moving in, during our unpacking stage. On her walking through the front door I come to the top of the stairs and she immediately starts screaming ""fuck!"".

It took a little while to calm her down and let her know that we're tenants. She assumed she would be cleaning a vacant house and thought we were squatters, it was pretty hilarious.

So she goes around and starts doing her thing whilst we're all in our rooms unpacking. I go down to make a cup of tea and offer her one and we get chatting for a bit and before I know it she's roped me into helping her scrub the laminate flooring in one of the rooms. After a couple of hours of us both cleaning away she says that's her time up for the day and she'll be back tomorrow.

Next day rolls around and she turns up, I tell her that she's already done all of the work and that she can just go home if she wants and that I wouldn't say anything to the estate agents, but she insists on staying. I get the kettle on and she starts helping unpack our DVDs and arranging the furniture whilst giving everything a wipe down. It's after that part that she mentions that she's not actually getting paid for that day, that she was only hired for the one day. 

She went on to say that her own kids had just moved away for university and that she liked the company.

Hardly, we've been having injury issues at full back for a season and half with no real depth. We now finally do have depth and other options. 


He probably didn't want to start them both right away because we'd have three new signings at the back starting, his hand was forced today due to the injury. 



&gt; it makes me wonder whether Rodgers will favour Johnson at LB over Enrique at least until Enrique is fully fit, possibly longer.


No, we have Moreno and Enrique is finally back playing.


&gt; Manquillo is a loanee

Means nothing, two year deal and we can buy him if we want to, he's ours to use for this season and probably next so why wouldn't he.


&gt;  deal in place with Athletico to buy Manquillo after the two years 


This has already been confirmed, we have a set price we can pay after the two years. They can also buy him back out of the loan early after the first season though.


&gt; And where does that put Glen Johnson?


Rotation option, backup, whatever you want to call it.



&gt; What do you think? Will Glen Johnson still be a first-choice full-back this season, even with Manquillo, Monero, Enrique and Flanagan as alternatives?


No

I disagree. Last season we had no backup with Enrique injured, and this season he's still bedding in the new signings. Maybe Manquillo and Moreno will hold down their places, or maybe Glen will find some form again and earn a starting berth. Either way, it will be as meritocratic as it has been with our centre backs (i.e. Agger).

People have been too quick to write off Glen IMO. He's had one bad season where he's had a couple of injuries along with no competition for his place.

We've seen how he's turned many companions like Martha Jones into warriors, and the realization pains him; a trail of death follows him wherever he goes.

He's like Danny Pink, who suffers from his past, but ultimately we see he can't seem to shake his identity as a soldier (nod to Danny's first scene). So the reason why he doesn't like soldiers is because they remind him of himself - and he'd rather run and hide from these mirror images than face them.

Kaboul was useless, and Townsend should be ashamed of how he was dispossessed so easily. The only decent attacks we had were off long balls as well, which is more than a little concerning.

We got raided in our last house at 3 in the morning. I was sleeping at the time and got woke up to people shouting ""is anybody in the house?"", I shit bricks because only the month prior we got broken into whilst one of the housemates was in his room.

So me and one of the housemates gets to the top of the stairs and there's 3 policemen shouting at us to get into the front room. So we scuffle down there whilst the third housemate is still asleep in his room.

The two of us are made to stand confused in the front room with two of the officers whilst a third starts checking all of the rooms. One of the officers we're with remarks how white I look (I'm just pale) and asks if there's anything I should be worried about. I ended up blurting out 'the 3 men in my house', it got a laugh out of his partner next to him but his hand immediately went to his taser on his hip and rests there, starts saying that we're lucky the door was unlocked because it would have been off the hinges otherwise.

His mate comes down the stairs after searching away and waking up my bewildered sleeping housemate (which I found pretty funny, I can only imagine having to wake up with an officer standing over you).

 Remy is not going to be anywhere near as good as some people on here think is going to be. This sub is setting some weird expectations of him to be a great striker when I think he will be below Ba's level.
My flatmate is from Newcastle and is a diehard fan. I watched a ton of Newcastle matches with him last season and I can tell you from first hand experience that Remy is very bad at holdup play, linking up with the midfield and with his back to goal. He uses his strengths, which are his legs (speed) and loves to run in behind and run into space. Aside from the odd game with a decent side we usually don't have anywhere near the space Remy had to run into against opposition defenses. I really have a hard time seeing him succeed with our style of football. A lot of people on here complained about Lukaku not fitting into our side because of the way he plays, Remy is even worse in this regard. I would say he relies on space even more so than Lukaku.

I think he would be a decent sub for us, late in a game we need to win when he can use his speed assets, but I would not be very confident if we had Costa injured and needed Remy to be our main striker.

Mignolet made a great stop and did well to pressurise Adebayor when he was through however I think he needs to really work on his catching. There was one or two signs that he still could be shaky. Overall he was good again

My verdict is:

A bit shaky at times and there was a little bit of miscommunication from the lads however there definitely has been progress good progress made.

A LOT of people in this country simply don't know how to cook well, or aren't particularly skilled at cooking cheap nutritionally balanced meals - especially those who grew up in poverty, left school early and didn't do any more than an hour or two a week of (non-compulsory!) home economics throughout the years they *were* in education. 

Add these circumstances together, and what do you get? A British underclass that's completely reliant on cheap, fast-to-cook processed meals and frozen foods. And if anything harder than microwaving or straight-to-oven meals is completely out of their cooking vocabulary (especially if their parents never taught them this because they died early, or were completely off their heads on drugs, or because they themselves live without one or more pieces of basic cooking equipment in assisted housing or a council-funded B&amp;B), then what do we expect? 

By contrast, the girls of my mum's generation did home economics at least twice a week, for around two hours a day. Sexist? Yes, perhaps. But they were some damn useful skills to have around the home. 

Personally, I think we need a push to bring back some of those 'old ways', and introduce a mandatory GCSE or two in what used to be called 'home economics' as a matter of urgency. Especially for those who aren't much cop at the academic subjects. It's all very well having a focus on the science of cooking and the food pyramid in primary school, but what's the use if most poorer children have never actually been taught how to cook cheaply (and well) for themselves?

What we *are* seeing is that the best developers go contract - because it's preferable to be your own boss and work for £300 a day, rather than £30,000 a year and (depending on which company you work for) all the corporate nonsense that goes with it with no clear sign of an end. 

The average developer on £30/35k *now* is in fact the un-savvy developer who hasn't gone contracting yet or who doesn't mind permanent employment because it suits their lifestyle. (Edit: Or it could be a developer who is still working their way up and getting the skills needed before moving on to bigger and better things). 

This is all depending on location of course. £30k in Manchester will get you a more senior developer than £30k in London because London costs a lot more to live in. 

Another thing to consider is the influx of immigrant developers and there are some to an extent - the difficulty being sorting the good from the bad. Many of them work for the same big companies overseas and then come here - there's no way of knowing which are the aces and which really haven't got the kind of structured approach and personal skills necessary for work here (and a lot of companies do look for that).

Either way I feel here is a shortage of skills here in the UK and we really could use more *good* software developers.

I think watching the first two serials from the first Doctor are essential viewing. It's great to see where the show began and what the pacing was like at the time. From there try out a sample of each type of story. For example, the 60s series had some historical episodes set in the past. No alien or supernatural foes involved. Give one of those a try. The Aztecs is a fun one. 

If you have a favorite monster/villain make their starting serials a priority. Go with something that feeds in to your likes or interests. The other option is to pick a Doctor and just start from their opening episode and watch until you've gotten enough and want to swap to a different era. 

There are times where I miss the old shows ability to roam about in a particular story over the course of weeks. I occasionally wonder if they could do that for the current series beyond the typical two-parters. Doubtful but it'd be a fun experiment to try.

The special effects were awful, like something out of the Tom Baker era. 

I did like the byplay between Clara and the Doctor.

CLARA: ""How do I look?""
DOCTOR: ""Short and round but with a great personality and that's what's important.""
CLARA: ""No, I changed my clothes.""
DOCTOR: ""I'm glad you're still making an effort. That's important.""

A friend said last week the show is evolving in the direction of the great man and his capable administrative assistant. I was thinking last night it had a big-brother/little-sister dynamic. Then my friend came back today and said that the show is about a gay man and his best friend.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;There's a massive difference between a stop n search and investigating the systemic rape of vulnerable white girls by an organised gang is there not?

Despite your decision to ignore them, the statistics I cited include arrests, out-of-court disposals, and prosecutions, as well as 'stop n search'. If authorities were reluctant to take action against non-white perpetrators or suspects for any reason whatsoever, we would expect non-white individuals to be less—not more—likely to be arrested and prosecuted than white individuals.

&gt;I'l pull a quote out of the report into this incident for you:

&gt;""In the broader organisational context, there was a widespread perception that messages conveyed by some senior people in the Council and also the Police, were to ‘downplay’ the ethnic dimensions of CSE""

&gt;""downplay the ethnic dimensions""

&gt;not quite as provably false i fear....

'Widespread perception' does not diminish the fact that statistics from the Ministry of Justice fail to confirm the hypothesis that authorities are reluctant to take action against non-white perpetrators or suspects.

&gt;The perpetrators were almost exclusively Pakistani Muslim males, and the victims were almost exclusively white girls. That does not mean that all Muslims or Pakistani's are paedophiles, obviously. However it does mean that there is a specific problem in this area, and that race is playing a significant part, and people's unwillingness to face up to this fact for the sake of political sensitivity has directly resulted in more children being abused.

This is conjecture. The fact that the perpetrators of sexual crime investigated by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham are predominately of the same ethnic group is no more indicative that 'race is playing a significant part' in these crimes than the fact that the perpetrators of sexual crime investigated by Operation Yewtree are predominately of the same ethnic group is indicative that race played 'a significant part' in those crimes; and the claim that 'political sensitivity has directly resulted in more children being abused' is supported only by the dubious testimony of the authorities who have been accused of inaction.",0,1409511637,null,0,false,0,ck5m25z,t3_2f2wog,t1_ck5m25z,t1_ck5i0kh,null,1427266815,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1

*I really like him as a player and I can see him excel in our defense, but he needs to work on both his positional play and when and where he can charge into duels like a horny elephant.*

When it comes to the defense as a whole I thought it looked better than in the first two games. It was obvious that they've used this week to work on containing the space between the center and full backs - looked a helluva lot better today.

Manquillo looks great in the ""1-on-1""-situations, but still has a way to go on offense and his positional play.

Sakho, as always, is a beast, but he's still not playing up to his best standard. Hopefully he'll get there now that Skrtel is out.

Moreno was superb. Fuck yes. Finally a great full back. Ridiculous goal.

I have Israeli relatives, I'd be more concerned about them being hurt on the roads. In NI terrorism became the problem as opposed to constitutional issues (the '98 GFA was ultimately ""Sunningdale ('73) for slow learners"" after all). In Palestine the problem is Israeli intransigence, whereas in NI the intransigence was on both sides (even the SDLP refused solutions that didn't involve an all-Ireland council).

Fundamentally, it was loyalist and republican terrorism ending that allowed a solution to NI.

Bearing in mind that I'm not an expert, my reading of those new powers when they were enacted required that the squatter entered the premises illegally.  As such I don't think the new powers apply to persons refusing to leave at the end of a tenancy.

- We have the 152Mb

- I run a server that hosts TeamSpeak, CS:GO, a website, my Server 2012 installation which shares media over my network and a media streaming server / torrent box.

- All devices in the house use this (server, two gaming machines, Galaxy S3 and S4).

- Never had any slowdown. YouTube is fine.

- Had some connection issues over the past few months. Twice for one day. I've used the service for 10 years, this is the first time it has had any ""serious"" issues.

Stuff you should know:

- The distance you are from the exchange makes absolutely zero difference with Virgin fibre services.

- The SuperHub 1 is shit. The SuperHub 2 is better. Best performance will be getting a SuperHub 2, putting it in modem mode and using your own router. You can get a really good one for £50 - £75 and any issues you ***may*** have with the SuperHub should disappear.

- If it turns out you're getting issues with the connection, tell Virgin. They'll come out, test the line, etc. If the power is too low or whatever, they'll install a powered booster. They did it at my house when we went to 152Mb. It was free.

- They have excellent service in my experience. They have all of the usual issues of booking during working hours, but one time we moved the TV to the other side of the living room and some channels were glitchy. We called Virgin, they sent out a guy and he even ran a new higher quality coax cable under the carpet for us. Solved the issue completely. Wasn't even their fault, but they sorted it anyway.

- All in all, I'd never use anyone else in the UK. Solid service. Also the new ""big"" bundles are only 12 month contracts.

The episode is different from the usual format of the show (Doctor and Companion go somewhere, find trouble) but it is completely representative of the kind of storytelling in the show - what type of sci-fi it is and what kinds of monsters and mysteries are faced. And that matters more. If you're introducing someone to the show, you want them to see what kind of stories are told - it's not important that they see the most typical episode - just that the identity of the show is represented.

And really, there is no typical Doctor Who episode. Every one is different. And that is what's unique about the show - that it has such a range, that it can be anything. The Lodger is nothing like The Next Doctor. Blink is nothing like The Girl Who Waited.

Blink works, better than almost any episode as an introduction. This episode introduces us to The Doctor through Sally's eyes. Sally does not know who or what the Doctor is - she is the perfect anchor for new viewers - because the audience learns about the situation as she does. And anyone can go into that episode with absolutely zero fore-knowledge.

Maybe after that, show them a typical episode. But if you're trying to get someone who is against watching the show to be interested - Blink is the best hook to get someone interested.",0,1409513726,null,0,false,0,ck5mztd,t3_2f364t,t1_ck5mztd,t1_ck5mfil,null,1427266378,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

In the second half my only worry with him was how rashly he went into tackles, and how he often completely miss-timed them, letting players like Lamela get past way too easily. In other parts he was good, but I didn't think his overall performance was immense.

Yes they are inexperienced while playing together and yes, having three french speaking guys (Mignolet included) in the middle and two Spaniards on the wings makes communication difficult but nevertheless, Lovren did some pretty bad mistakes that another team could have punished while Sakho's passing was shaky in the beginning.

Then there was the whole concept which just felt clunky and overly literal. Climbing into a dalek's mind to poke around and try to discover its morality. Really?

The Doctor's speech to Rusty felt like a much lamer version of the speech 11 gave in The Rings of Akhaten. The only cool part was the visuals and the implications of the Doctor's hate... but all of that felt like a retread of the season 1 episode Dalek.

And on top of all that, I was a bit disappointed in the Doctor. I wasn't big on the scene where he sacrificed that one guy to the antibodies or the way he turned down Blue at the end. Okay, I get it, he's darker and willing to do what's necessary but that doesn't mean he has to be a dick about it.

When I retire, I plan on living off the equivalent of 40k/y (I may complement that with some work, but probably not in my current field but rather in things I actually want to do).

The western tax systems I know of are so broken it's ludicrous. I can't see why you criticise someone aspiring to make 65k/y throughout his working years (on average), just because I'm trying to compress my working years into my thirties. I don't see why I can't do what I legally can to make the most of my work.

I'd be happy to pay even more tax, so long as I knew my financial clients who make 2x or 5x or 10x what I make will pay their share.

As for what was said elsewhere in this thread, I'm not sure I'm really providing all that much value to society. Selling the shit I sell (don't tell my customers I said that) provides little value. I don't think my customers provide that much value themselves, while we're at it. I hope to be bringing a lot more value when I retire than what I do now.

One of the dreams I have is to be a teacher, for example; when I was in uni I volunteered with kids who have learning disabilities, and it was a very rewarding experience for me. Maybe I'd like to get back to that. But I also want my kids to be well off, and I want them to have as many opportunities as my good fortune can allow them, and I don't know of teachers making neither 125k nor 250k.",0,1409515666,null,0,false,0,ck5nub2,t3_2f2yoz,t1_ck5nub2,t1_ck5hr0i,null,1427265983,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

In essence, there's not a shortage of IT workers but there's a shortage of skilled, experienced local IT staff with good soft skills.  


On a side rant, this is partly because the perm wages are so crap, so many IT jobs I see advertised want 5-10 years experience and a degree + certs but are only willing to pay £30k. Yet their grads will be on £26k. wtf guys.

Everybody would need to learn about their diets, learn about processed foods and exactly how bad they are for you and being taught how to formulate their own meal plans and diets.

Yet their grads will be on £26k. wtf guys. 

This is the bit that seems *very* hit and miss for me. Some companies will pay pretty well - others do indeed expect the moon on a stick (or 'unicorn shit' as we sometimes call it) - experience that's pretty much impossible to find for the price. 

That being said, I rarely see jobs needing 5-10 years experience for £30k - more like 3-4, but there are plenty of IT people who would rather have more (and in fairness, who wouldn't?). 

It's a tricky one. I hesitate to say whether someone is or isn't worth that kind of salary. It's still above national average and not all developers are absolute aces who could create the next world-beating sorting. Many are 'middle of the road' and salaries do match that.

also, on the issue of driving it into the groun d, do you want to risk driving the same hatchback for 11 years? Or run a nice 2nd hand Mondeo to death in 5? Cars get boring after a while.

Is it ironic that the player Lovren reminds me of is Agger? So calm on the ball and his recovery to make that beautiful slide tackle on Adebayor shows how good of a defender he is. Him and Sakho NEED to play together every week. How else can they develop chemistry? Every mistake they made was due to not being used to playing with each other, and we STILL won 3-0 and kept the clean sheet.

Just a reminder for everyone: Manquillo is 19. He will either get sent off or suspended for too many yellows at some point during this season. I don't want people grabbing their pitchforks once he makes an inevitable mistake. He is incredibly athletic and has great defensive instincts. He already brings more to the table defensively than Glen Johnson. But he is cavalier going into risky tackles and I like that attitude so please don't overreact when he fucks up once.

Moreno showed his class today on both ends of the pitch. Nailed on starter. Instant upgrade from Enrique and Flanagan. I say move Flanno back over to the right and rotate him with Manquillo, allowing Enrique to deputize for Moreno.

Finally, people need to give Mignolet a fucking break. We saw some mediocre kicking today but the man's reflexes are off the chain. He's not De Gea who can pretty much see the future his relexes are so good but we have to appreciate Mignolet's shot stopping. Reina would not have saved that Chadli shot.

I can make one large 'meal' last most of the week for well under a fiver. I was lucky to grow up with parents who were taught to cook on a budget, and put vegetables in every meal. I think a lot of people over-rely on meat which is incredibly expensive for the amount you get; I'm not a veggie but it is way cheaper if you can have meals that don't need to include meat.

I did home economics at school but it wasn't great. We could really done with knowing how much is sensible to spend on food per week, and how to plan and budget your meals properly. Although one of my friends from another school couldn't (at 18) tell the difference between a cooked and a raw whole chicken, so I guess we could have done a lot worse.

I've also worked in a foodbank and had many people refuse decent stuff because they/their children won't eat plain cereal or tinned vegetables. A lot of people also don't know how to cook, so if they are given stuff that requires preparation they are completely clueless. I'm of the attitude that if your children really are hungry, they will learn to eat what is put in front of them - certainly was the case for me (though I still hate peas). Since there is no nutrition education at school, though, people don't understand fully how bad it is to feed your children processed carbs and sugar all the time.

If the medical staff threatened to cut out the parents forcefully, rather than convince them of their rationale, you can understand why the family would be more likely to take matters into their own hands.

When I was 17, I was an A-level politics student. Top of my class in terms of knowledge and background reading I was quite passionate and seeking to maybe to a politics degree. The reality of the matter was though that politics was just not a viable degree choice.

After several years I reembarked on my voyage into education and have gone the computer science route. The prospects for computer science are far greater and its a practical degree I can use. I have also fallen into the company of older computer scientists who work in the field so I have some connections to help me there. Yet my long term goal of going into politics is unaffected, funny that.

Part of the issue of graduates being unable to obtain work is that their degree just doesn't apply to a job.

I have my first day at work tomorrow! Can't thin of a way of rather start the week and month. Mind is whirling with the thoughts of what I'll buy with my first wage, and I'm now set up on the idea of a PS4. I wasn't sure but it's just actually too useful, and I miss playing FIFA.

And more on my nipple: I was sat for ages trying to get the piercing out myself, even using tools to no avail. So I go see to the piercer and she says she'll do it for free and I should hop on the chair. She whips it out within two seconds! I've never felt embarrassment like it...in my defence she had rubber gloves which helped the grip, and I'd loosened it for her!

true,NeonAardvark,null,null,"IT recruiters are mostly terrible about sorting the wheat from the chaff and it's probably a line of work that will be obsolete soon. Doing this properly means getting people to do things in front of you - coding, or fixing a server, etc depending on the line of work and knowing enough to judge how well they're doing. One problem with that is IT recruiters have no practical domain knowledge, so they probably haven't even thought of doing this and couldn't do it properly anyway.      

In all technical areas of work, it would be better if there was a higher percentage of talented people.         

In most technical areas (like coding) this comes down ultimately to innate talent - there are lots of people in software who cannot code well or at all, and will never be able to. They don't have the ability to properly think in the abstract and never will, no matter how much they learn or practice.          

This is a societal problem ultimately - average intelligence has been falling for a couple of decades, which means the upper end of the bell curve is shrinking. Employers should grin and bear high paid contracts for top notch developers, it's the market in action. They should also interview properly and pay good money to kids straight from University who are talented, who often won't get past the buzz word filters of recruiters/HR departments/crappy managers.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"As an American, this is the way I sorted it out for myself

Domestic:

-Premier League: The bread and butter. The top divison of football in England, comparable to the NFL or NBA for American football or basketball. There are no playoffs at the end of the season, the winner is simply the team at the top of the table after each club plays each other twice (home and away). There are 20 teams; at the end of the season the bottom 3 clubs in the table are 'relegated' to the the 2nd divison (think AAA baseball), and are replaced by the 3 best clubs from that league. Depending on opinion this is one of the two most important competitions Chelsea compete in, winning it demonstrates both skill and incredible consistency. 

-FA Cup: A knockout-tournament open to teams from all divisions of the English football pyramid (like if A, AA, AAA, and MLB teams all played each other). Historically important and one of Chelsea's specialities in the last decade or so, but for financial reasons is now less favored. Occasionally yields great fairy-tale stories when lower-league teams defy the odds to win the whole thing, or even strange ones like 2 years ago when Wigan won the FA cup and got relegated from the premier league in the same season. 

-League Cup (Capital 1): Fairly similar to the FA cup, but much less prestigious, open to less clubs, and waaay down the priority list. This competition is often used by Chelsea to give gametime to fringe players or give youngsters (rookiees) a chance. Winning only this cup in a season would be considered unsuccessful for a club like Chelsea; along with other trophies it's icing on the cake. 

International:

-Champions League: Up with the PL in importance, if not more important. The competition consists of 2 phases: a group stage where groups of 4 teams play each other twice; and a knockout round, where the top 2 teams from each group enter a tournament to determine the winner (similar to the world cup if you're familiar with that). The clubs themsleves come from all over Europe. Each country's amount of representation is basically dependent on how strong their domestic league is. The PL is one of the strongest leagues, so the top four clubs from its table qualify (Spain 4, Germany 4, Italy 3, etc.) Winning is extremely difficult; Chelsea won for the first time in 2012, arguably the club's greatest ever achievement 

-Europa League: Basically a champions's league-lite. Teams from around Europe, but not quite good enough for the CL. Teams who finish 3rd from their CL group stage are seeded into the competition, which happened to Chelsea for the first time in the 2012/13 season. Of course, we went on to win it ;). Importance is controversial, in the end probably on par with an FA Cup. However, we really don't want to find ourselves playing this, the Champion's League is where we belong (you don't play in both at the same time, 1 or neither). 

Misc: There are some other competitions Chelsea could potentially play based on its performance. The winner of the PL and the FA cup play each other in a one-off game called the Community Shield at the beginning of the next season. Similarly, the winners of the CL and EL play each other in the UEFA Supercup. The winner of the CL also qualify for the Club World Cup, where the winners from the Champion's Leagues from all the continents play each other. 
None of those competitions are considered that important.

Note that the competions are essentially played in parallel to one another. Like I said, most of Chelsea's games are in the PL. Generally the PL games are on Saturdays and Sundays, other competitions on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The most common kickoff times are 10 am Eastern on weekends and 2:45 pm Eastern on midweek days. The day scheduling can vary a bit, kickoff scheduling varying more. In a few weeks once the season gets into full swing, Chelsea will almost always play 2 games a week (weekend-midweek). 

Not directly related but something you may be interested in, there is national team-football (playing for countries instead of clubs). throughout the season. During these periods, the club schedules take a break - there's actually a 2 week international break soon. Most of the games are 'friendlies', which help the national teams prepare for their various competitions (usually played in the club off-season, the summer). There are also qualifiers for those competitions.  Chelsea players are among the best, so they are often chosen to represent their countries if you are interested in watching them play more. Don't forget to watch America play, you can be passionate about them and Chelsea simultaneously.  

Feel free to ask more questions! Welcome to the fold.

He said ""white professionals' oversensitivity to political correctness and fear of appearing racist may well have contributed to justice being stalled.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazir_Afzal

More 

&gt; Nazir Afzal readily acknowledges that his cultural heritage played a part in getting nine men convicted of running a child exploitation ring in Rochdale earlier this year. He famously reopened the case against the gang of Asian men that groomed young girls for sex, shortly after his appointment as head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in the north-west of England. And he suggests that being an Asian himself made it easier to take that step.

&gt; ""My Pakistani heritage helped cut through barriers within the black and minority ethnic communities,"" he says. ""And white professionals' oversensitivity to political correctness and fear of appearing racist may well have contributed to justice being stalled.""

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","As I recall you've said similar things to me before about IT recruiters - I'm sorry you've got a chip on your shoulder but try and realize in all likelihood I've never dealt with you and am not responsible for any bad experiences you've had. 

I can only speak of my own experience of course.. 

We're not likely to be obsolete any time soon. There are always companies who need help with recruitment and always people seeking employment who don't know where to look. Plenty of SME's (and larger companies) haven't the manpower or experience to handle searching for new talent themselves - or would simply rather hand that over to a third party. 

&gt; Doing this properly means getting people to do things in front of you - coding, or fixing a server, etc depending on the line of work and knowing enough to judge how well they're doing. One problem with that is IT recruiters have no practical domain knowledge, so they probably haven't even thought of doing this and couldn't do it properly anyway. 

We don't interview the candidates - our clients interview the candidates. We pre-screen them to ensure that when they look for (for example) a software tester - they're not inundated by 200+ applicants from the UK and overseas, many of whom haven't even mentioned software testing experience on their CV's or require sponsorship or didn't realize the job was in Manchester when they're living in London (and all of this is I dealt with last week). 

For what it's worth - many of our clients have practical examinations or methods of testing the knowledge of the applicant. You're not thinking of anything new. 

&gt;  Employers should grin and bear high paid contracts for top notch developers, it's the market in action.

Assuming unlimited resources for the company in question - which may not be the case. 

&gt; They should also interview properly and pay good money to kids straight from University who are talented...

Again I don't know what experience you have had - but mine is with clients who pay reasonable salaries to graduates and do have progress beyond that. I have a feeling you're assuming big money to graduates though, which again may not be an asset the business has. 

The logical conclusion of your way of thinking is a handful of graduates holding companies to ransom in a bidding war which is *great* for those developers but utterly useless to everyone else. 

As soon as you mention salary however, a lot of developers assume they're somehow owed the big bucks even when their experience doesn't match. The trick is matching those with the ability to those companies they want to work with and who are happy to pay the level they're looking for. 

&gt; ...who often won't get past the buzz word filters of recruiters/HR departments/crappy managers. 

This made me laugh. Just last week I was chucking out CVs of people applying to a £40k Java developer role who hadn't mentioned Java or any associated technologies on their CVs. A couple did have other development experience but when I asked them if they had ever used anything Java based they had not (but would of course be happy to re-train). 

I already know from the development manager of the company that they don't want someone looking to re-train. 

You scoff at people like me because of 'buzz words' - I scoff back and think of all the people who apply for jobs they have absolutely no experience for. I'm not sure what buzz words you're imagining we screen - but when I advertise for (for instance) a software tester - I'd like to see some evidence of software testing on that CV. You'd be amazed how many times it's not there. ",0,1409519480,null,0,false,0,ck5pkz7,t3_2f3lq2,t1_ck5pkz7,t1_ck5p6kv,null,1427265171,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

We got told to go to university, and then we were told we were wasting our time. We ended up under a mountain of debt, unable to get a job because nobody wanted to take us on, and then we got demonised, tarred as being lazy when we turned to the dole. Every place we turned we had some prick jabbing at us. 

We don't have any property prospects. We have delusional older folk yammering about first time buying losing hope. Newsflash: we lost hope a long fucking time ago. That property ladder is long gone, and the rental ladder is leaving behind it. We're living with our parents until we're at the end of our twenties, how sad is that? Some of us don't have parents and we've got moron Etonians arrogantly urging us to go and sponge off the non-existant bank of mum and dad. We've got teenagers who spend their nights in crowds on the top decks of buses because the parents literally tell them not to come home. As a result they spend the nights alternatively trying to avoid getting stabbed by other bus gangs and look like they're the next people who will stab someone for looking at them wrong. 

I could go on, but you get the general disillusionment of my generation, and the ones either side, by now. Is it any wonder some of them sat up and said ""fuck you""?

true,BaBaFiCo,null,null,"&gt;How does this compare to the UK system?  Do you stay with your chosen topic all through university, are there core requirements everyone has to fulfill, or do students regularly take electives?  Also, do you generally only take classes with other students in your own course of study?  

For each degree, there are a group of core modules (classes) a student must take. These might be shared with people doing similar, but slightly different, degrees. For example, I studied Film Production Technology and I sat my core modules with students also studying Video Editing and other courses. After these, you may just a number of elected classes, which are usually concerned with the course you are studying. The classes available to students are governed by the course they take. So as a Film Production student I wasn't able to study an motor engineering class, but I did study Introduction to Teacher Training. 

&gt;What are some common ways to get to know other people while you're in university?  What kinds of things do students do as extracurricular activities?  

There were societies for everything such as  Christians, Caribbeans, LGBT and Muslims. It was perfectly fine to be a member of these and I even visited the Christian one once to socialise, despite not being a believer myself. 

&gt;Are there activity-based clubs?  What are some things you might join a club at university to do?  I think you have casual sports at university, is that correct?  

Football, rugby, ultimate Frisbee, cheer leading, drinking. You name it, there's a society for it. Students are also welcome to form their own society which will be funded by the university. 

&gt;Mostly, I'm curious about how people in the UK make friends during this part of their lives.

You live in dorms (one person to each room) for your first year. I lived on a floor with fifteen others. You leave your door open, invite people in or walk into others rooms. You share a beer, play some FIFA and make friends. You might make friends on your course who lives in a different dorm and they introduce you to their friends. You might meet people at the Student Union on a night out during a standard Friday Night fancy dress themed night. You join societies and get involved. 

Making friends isn't too hard and I don't imagine its too different to the American system.

AS the guy below says, they do not understand at all what the kids realistic prognosis is, the radation treatment is to try and prevent the cancer returning - at least quickly. In all reality it will and it needs to be done ASAP. The only difference, how much damage their is to the brain as a whole, is largely irrelevant at this point. 

Hell this whole 'cutting edge' thing is part of the problem, it still blasting the kids allready badly damaged brain with radiation. Just a type that will scatter less. That it'll kill all the remaining cancer cells if the tumour metastasised (likely)is a very- very long shot and we are talking a situation where if one cell gets away, its all been pointless. So every minute counts.

They think he's going to get better and the nasty incompetent doctors are holding back the cure.

The doctors are recommending the best palliative option. By the time we are at brain surgery and radio therapy curing the kid, or even making him properly conscious of his situation for any significant period - is unfortunately minuscule.  

Seriously, when cancer gets in the brain it becomes a empirical proof (as in the case of my aunt) how there cannot be a loving god. 

Hell they likely want to get him to old school radiotherapy ASAP, is it makes you very fuzzy and so likely it'll make things a lot easier on the kid. Again the kind of truth that cannot be spoken.

true,IanCal,null,null,"&gt; They would both be exactly equivalent except that people will likely be in a lower tax bracket when they retire, and pensions have a single tax-free lump sum withdrawal.

Yes, which can make a huge difference. You get 25% of the total tax free, £10k a year tax free (personal allowance) if you have no other sources of income and then will be taxed at probably no more than 20% for the remaining sum.

I imagine it'd be pretty hard to construct a situation where you end up with less from a SIPP than from an ISA. There are benefits from the ISA around flexibility though, that's their benefit.

Let's picture a scenario where we put £1k/mo into an ISA and SIPP for a 40% rate taxpayer, with the same investments earning 4%/year after inflation for 30 years.

That turns into £694k in the ISA and £1.156M in the SIPP.

Assuming no further growth, and withdrawing an after-tax salary of £30k a year from each, you'd get the full amount from the ISA, and for the SIPP:

30k after tax is 40k pre-tax (assuming you still pay national insurance) so we need to take out £40k a year, and we can do that to withdraw a total of 867k (~75% of the total in the SIPP).

However, with the 25% tax free, we can extract that first: £289k

And then from the remaining £867k we can withdraw: £650k

Added together we can take a total of £939k out.

If you can knock off national insurance from the equation we get a nicer figure again (we'd only need £35k to withdraw per year) of just over £1M.

Beyond this is starts to get more complicated with regards to state pension, etc, but the differences can be pretty massive.",0,1409522079,null,0,false,0,ck5qqls,t3_2f2pty,t1_ck5qqls,t1_ck5pwnv,null,1427264631,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

A common theme is looking for a checklist of memorized languages and APIs, knowing the solutions to stupid puzzles and various bits of programming trivia rather than looking for the actual skills to do the job.

For non-developers, one analogy would be looking for novelists by checking whether they can quote rules of English grammar, whether they know the menu and toolbar layouts and keyboard shortcuts for your preferred word processor, and whether they're good at crosswords - but never bothering to check whether they can write novels.

Programming ability isn't about memorizing language reference manuals and the solutions to obscure programming puzzles that virtually no-one solves the first time they see them - a lot of recruiters (apparently) act is if having rote-learned all the stuff you can Google in 5 seconds is *all* there is to programming, whereas in reality it's not even very relevant - a bit of a head start, maybe, but even that assumes you have the *relevant* skills that recruiters (apparently) often aren't checking for at all.

Some of the things recruiters look for may even directly select [architecture astronauts](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html). I have architecture astronaut tendencies myself so I'll just say that while we aren't automatically disasters (honest guv) we *do* need to be aware of that tendency and to keep it controlled.

Getting back to the point, it's entirely possible that there's plenty of skills available, but employers are blind to those skills during recruitment.

My knowledge of Chelsea youth is obviously limited as a Milan fan but these are the only players I could think of who are part of, or victims of, the 'loan system'. Courtois was the only one to survive it, and is it then really a surprise that he is the only one of those who could go straight into the Chelsea team? Even he had tough competition with Cech but he was obviously good enough. No other Chelsea youth has shown themselves to be good enough to go right into the team, so is it a surprise that none of them have made it into the team (barring Lukaku who would have been behind Costa, but his circumstances were different anyway)? Is it really better for him to sit on the bench for 12 months and have a small chance to prove himself every other month, or play for 12 months, try and prove like Courtois that he can go straight into the team, and either succeed and go into the team or have his price and stature increase to sell him on at a better price?

Sorry, rambled too much. I think the loan system is working perfectly fine, very few talents in the world can get into Chelsea's side, so out of say 10 players on loan, only 1 makes it in.

From the day AVB left Ade has earned his place in the starting 11, he's made goals out of nothing, consistently worked hard for the team and has been one of our better players. This is the Ade that against West Ham turned and beat Collins to win the free-kick and get Collins his second yellow bringing it to 10 men each, Ade who scored and contributed to our demolition of QPR. He worked tirelessly for the team today and I know someone is going to say he lost the ball too much but honestly who didn't today. If you could straight swap the name on his shirt to Soldado there would be boy jizz and love ins every week for how he ended last season and started this. 

""we don't play to Soldados strengths, he needs to be in the box"" Same people who slated Defoe for not doing enough outside the box.

""he had 3 different managers"" as has everyone else.

""he hasn't had the chances"" he has. He missed a lot of chances. 

""that link up play is great tho"" there have been some nice touches but enough to dislodge Ade since he got back in the team?

""him and Lamella play great together"" Where has this come from? I see it in every thread now and I feel like I've missed something. Is it based on pre-season? Because in competitive matches which actually count, they've barely barely played together and bar one good goal in the Europe League against Norways 4th best domestic team, it's never really been that impressive.

I seriously don't understand how people on here can justify the idea of Jan getting the armband after last season. When things went poorly and he was forced to play out of position, he completely shut down. That is *not* something you can have in a captain. We need a leader on the pitch who will stay in it and not give up if things are going poorly, and based on last season that simply isn't Jan. We can't afford to have a captain that might just shut down once things turn bad, because that's when captains are most important. I love Jan, he's a fantastic player, but he absolutely does not deserve the captaincy.

true,NeonAardvark,null,null,"&gt; True but that's not all we do. Unless you can automate something that takes into account commute times, part time requirements, relocation costs, pregnancy and all the other little nuances that make someone unique - you're not going to have a fail-safe system and if it's not reliable, what's the point.

I'm not talking about a fail safe system, I'm talking about first pass filtering. If the main thing you do is buzzword filtering that can be replaced with an automated filtering of words in CVs, hiring managers can handle those other issues. Certainly doesn't seem to justify ~20 % first year salary.           

The other thing is, if you have an automated first pass filter system you could maybe do a little better - coding exercises, syntax questions, etc.       

&gt; Bit of a conflicting one this - as we have senior developers on the client side who are hiring who categorically say they won't wait for someone to train up or to take that chance.      

I'm not talking about taking a chance, I'm saying proper interviews weed out talented candidates from the bad. Let me repeat, good software engineers don't need to be ""trained"" in a new language, they have a skill set and innate ability that allows them to pick up a new environment and tools autonomously. You can be looking for a while before one comes along.     
                    
The problem with taking the word of senior software engineers at a company as gospel is that they themselves maybe be mediocre time servers. In your position you should take it as gospel because you're a customer of theirs and the customer is always right.

I think the issue is basically people have only seen Holtby at CM (AVB's 4-3-3), and literally think he's horrible to mediocre and should be shipped out. I still see ''What CM do we sell? Dembele..Holtby..? Holtby ISN'T a CM. People aren't realizing, that he's actually one of the best passers we have, probably up there with Lamela and Eriksen as our most creative/vision easily and he actually has an engine. He's also a very underrated dribbler - he played tons of Futsal like Max Meyer so is very technically gifted and as one of the articles says - his low center of gravity allows him to shuffle past like players aren't there. 

We see none of that from CM. At CM, with the occasional game at AMC (so no consistency or faith shown) we just see a headless chicken who is forced to try and play disciplined. Can't people see WHY that's why he's been so poor, and doesn't always take his chances when he can? He's done some fantastic things, albeit not regularly cuz he doesn't get a chance. Eriksen is the golden boy, and suggesting moving him to the left (where he played for Ajax, and is effective enough there) is blasphemy - as only the main AMC will see the ball...or something. That's why I'm being downvoted for it. 

Despite the fact he'd be unmarkable coming in from the left dragging defenders with him creating even more space against organized, solid defenses - JUST LIKE TODAY.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; I'm talking about first pass filtering. If the main thing you do is buzzword filtering that can be replaced with an automated filtering of words in CVs, hiring managers can handle those other issues. Certainly doesn't seem to justify ~20 % first year salary. 

Except it's not the only thing agencies do - we also take requirements, write adverts and put them out on multiple job boards (each of which would cost agencies or companies hundreds of pounds to use). The adverts themselves need to be SEO as far as possible - each site uses its own algorithm to promote an advert based on how it is written. 

Then there's arranging interviews, dealing with feedback and issues, billing of contract staff... all that plus actively searching for appropriate candidates and dealing with active advert response. 

Do you reckon your average hiring manager is going to have time for all that? Especially in a small to medium company where they're more busy running their own development team etc? (I'll save you the trouble on that one - the answer is no, they generally don't). 

&gt; The other thing is, if you have an automated first pass filter system you could maybe do a little better - coding exercises, syntax questions, etc. 

This would also cut out any developer who can't be bothered with completing multiple questions every time they want to apply for *one* job. When you job hunt do you do it selectively and just go for one - or do you apply to as many places as possible to maximize your chances? 

&gt; You can be looking for a while before one comes along. 

So there *is* a skill shortage? 

If these people are that hard to find - and I think it's already safe to say a lot of hiring managers won't have time for such bespoke searching in addition to daily duties - then the need for agencies is pretty assured. 

Put it another way - if you end up *employing* a dedicated searcher for these people within the company you're not just paying a one off fee of 20% - you're paying someone else's salary entirely and depending on how much you recruit and what for, is it worth it? Do *they* have all that experience and industry knowledge? If they do you can bet they'll want decent money for it - just like good developers. 

Any way you cut it - we provide a service and screen our clients from a *lot* of crap as well as dealing with the good people. You might not like dealing with us for whatever reason, but automation won't solve all your issues here.

* While you can play around with some things and it won't hurt a recipe, and might make it better in your opinion (spices and whatnot) with other things it is important to stick to the recipe  like glue. Baking especially,  but any desserts, really. The difference between, for example, granulated sugar and caster sugar can kill a recipe.
* Like I said in the other post, dress it up. Nice candles, nice music, keep her out of the kitchen so she can't see the scene of culinary chaos you have created.

true,KaiserMacCleg,,,"I'm sorry, but claiming that something is infantile just because you cannot imagine how it could be work is not logically sound. There's a name for what you just did - an [argument from incredulity](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument_from_incredulity). 

Wales has a lot going for it, actually. We still, believe it or not, have a significant manufacturing base, and we have [the trade surplus to prove it](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/RTS/RTS%20Releases/Rts_Qtrly_Q1_2014.xls) (excel download warning!). Last year, Wales exported £14.789 bn worth of goods, fully double the £7.535 bn that we imported during the same period. Wales' aerospace industry is particularly promising, with companies like BA, Airbus and General Electric [employing upwards of 20,000 people across the country](http://www.assemblywales.org/05-026.pdf) - or 17% of the total workforce across the whole of the UK. 

It's not only manufactured goods that we export - energy is another key sector to consider. [In 2011, Wales produced 27,300 GwH of electricity](http://wales.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/energy-generation-consumption/?lang=en). That figure is well down on 2008's 35,000 GwH but still makes Wales a net exporter of electricity, with 3,700 GwH transported over the border to England. It's important to remember that this decline in electricity generation occurred during an economic contraction, and likely reflected a fall in demand. I would be surprised if both the total amount of electricity generated here and the amount exported have not increased since. The renewables sector presents a great opportunity in Wales, both in terms of generating capacity and as a test bed for new technology. There's a huge tidal resource in the Severn Estuary just waiting to be tapped into, not to mention the vast potential for further offshore windfarms in the Irish Sea.

The basis for a vibrant economy is already here, What we lack in Wales is the correct political and monetary environment to allow it to flourish. The overvaluing of the pound makes it tougher and more expensive to export compared with our competitors in Europe and North America. A chronic lack of investment in infrastructure makes attracting inward investment relatively difficult, compared to those areas of central and south-eastern England which are overrun with motorways and high speed rail and international airports. More control over our own affairs would make it easier to sort out these issues, so long as the political will is there. 

I firmly believe that independence, in the long run, is necessary in securing the economic prosperity of Wales. The problem is our budget deficit, the true scale of which hasn't even been properly quantified (or at least for anyone outside of government to know of). As I see it, we need to increase our tax take before becoming independent, and increasing our tax take requires us to fix the economy, which, so far as I can see, can only happen with (at least considerably more) independence. It's a chicken and egg problem, and the only way I can see out of our current bind is the gradual devolution of more taxation and borrowing powers to the Welsh Government so that, hopefully, we can begin to level the playing field with the rest of the UK. 

In reality, though, Wales' economic needs can only really be met once we ditch this hopelessly overvalued currency of ours.",0,1409527633,null,0,false,0,ck5t37p,t3_2f3m1x,t1_ck5t37p,t1_ck5n6ch,null,1427263465,11,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,11

He played at AML for Ajax in a 4-3-3 and is more than comfortable there.

Just because he's not the ''center for attention'' doesn't mean the ball won't ever go through him.

Plus also, sassy Martha and adorable Carey Mulligan as Sally Sparrow. 

I'm also with those who suggest The Girl in the Fireplace, but really I think Blink is a proper first episode for a doubter in the amazingness of DW. After you have convinced her that she likes it, you can start from the beginning of New-Who with S1E1, Rose. But I wish I'd seen Blink first--I nearly quit after Rose because it was so cheesy and had to be convinced by other friends to plow through Season 1. I didn't really *love* it until 2.2--after that I was hooked, and it took me forever to get there.

They really only need depth and ability while reliability (in terms of health) isn't as much of a concern since they only play 1 striker in their varying formations (and the fee is chump change for them not only because of Abramovich but also because of how good they've been at getting good prices for players they sell).

On the other hand, we played with 2 strikers last year and when Remy was going to be signed, we had 2 guys who were guaranteed to stay and a 3rd who's probably going to be sold in Borini. We need to be able to count on the health of our striker signing because our tactical variations do involve moving from 1 striker to 2 from game to game and we can't afford to be forced into playing just 1 striker if we have 3 games in a week and a striker is injured.",0,1409529516,null,0,false,0,ck5tvzz,t3_2f4e1i,t1_ck5tvzz,t3_2f4e1i,null,1427263092,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5
