Cutting spending is possible in certain areas, ~~housing~~ landlord benefit (This would need an increase in socially owned housing.), ~~working tax~~ employer credits, increase of minimum wage to living wage (this is good against companies that avoid tax payments since it forces them to cut into their untaxed profits). Much of our benefits help companies pay their workers less and help contribute to private profits. I can't see how that is just.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"Right now a big problem is the PFI (private finance initiative) schemes. Effectively in the olden days we used to pay for anything we cant afford today with gilts, i.e. public debt. Those are simply a loan backed by the government and the BoE. If it comes down to it a government will print money to pay off a gilt. Private investors buy gilts and the government uses their money to build hospitals. They are safe investments generally and hold the lowest interest rates of just about anything on the market.

A while back (started under the Tories, Labour ran wild with it) the mechanism for building infrastructure changed. Instead of using public debt to build infrastructure we had PFI schemes. Under PFI the infrastructure in question is owned by the private financiers who paid for it. The public service in question pays an ongoing fee for decades in a giant rent to buy scheme.

Why was PFI favoured? It doesn't show up as ""debt"" despite blatantly being debt. A big part of our deficit today is paying rent on PFI schemes. The result of this is our debt is now going up. Essentially years of Tory and Labour buying stuff using weird private mechanisms is catching up. The section of the public budget dedicated to servicing PFI has gone up and up every year until our choices are either public debt or service cuts. When the Tories came in about £70B was being spent annually servicing PFI contracts (i.e. paying interest).

The crazy thing about all this is national debt is much, much cheaper than PFI. Particularly because there are very few qualified PFI contractors who essentially operate as a cartel. One of the expected outcomes of PFI was it would cut unnecessary expenditure. In actuality it has increased unnecessary expenditure. A norm of refusing to deal with services until they sweeten the deal has emerged. In one case an NHS trust wanted to refurbish a wing of a hospital. It ended up replacing the entire hospital because that was the only project they could get PFI contractors to agree with.

&gt;If you want to make an argument about whether current debt is a problem, historic spending is not good supporting evidence.

Your saying it's not good evidence because the motivation of the governments who increased debt was not to increase it to boost the economy but so that the country to survive. But how is that relevant if the outcome of increasing the national debt at that time was not negative? Why do the motivations of the government matter? I'm not arguing that the Coalition during the war increased debt as a matter of public service.

I disagree. America continually reduced tax's and in general spending from the late 1970's onward s and although the income of the top 20% has increased the living standards have decreased for the majority of the population as has disposable income.

- Ensure that if businesses operate in the UK pay corporate tax. Loopholes are closed. Failure to pay will result in freezing of trade. Small businesses and start-ups will be given considerable tax.

- We're an island. So there should be no playing the property game. Individuals will have a max amount of properties they can own. Businesses will have a cap too. If after the law changes and you exceed the cap you will be charged and appropriate sum approximate to the actual value of the property. 

- Government departments will run telephone, internet, water, heating, electric, gas, and rail. Competition will be allowed however these base facilities will be rant at cost and not for profit. 

- City centres will be cleared from car traffic and deliveries will only be allowed to take place between 12am - 6am a la South Korea. To take another leaf from their book cafes and restaurants that use over x% of produce that is grown within the mainland UK will receive a huge discount on business rates and tax.

- Those without a job within 6 months will be assigned work within a newly constructed industry. Industry will comprise of textiles, clothing, basic electronics, and foodstuffs. Roles be assigned to best suit those out of work. Salary will be minimal but those working in the industry will have clothing, food, and entertainment devices provide from the very industry that they work in. 

- Education will be free and encouraged. People will be encouraged to study and if you're out of work you can either opt to work for a national average salary in the national industries or be given a basic living allowance to study to further yourself. 

- As opposed to taxing more for non-UK goods tax considerable less for UK grown and made products.

- Negative tax for those who who earn under the national average. Work contracts will either have to give a set amount of hours or pay x amount if hours can't be guaranteed.

- Finally. TAX THE RICH MORE. Scaling taxs based on % of income.

Well, yes. The EUR 100,000 limit is the minimum set by the [European Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes](http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/guarantee/), the denomination of the deposit has nothing to do with it (also, Sweden is outside of the Eurozone anyway).

As for Iceland, its Deposit Guarantee Scheme (which should have been compliant with abovementioned European directive, since Iceland is in the European Economic Area, allowing its banks to operate throughout the EU and the other EEA countries) simply folded because there's simply no way a nation of just over 300,000 people whose main natural resource is cod could respond to the immense liabilities its outsized banking sector had accumulated.

So, if you want a sound sleep, avoid mostly banks from countries with a disproportionately big banking sector, like Cyprus (oops, too late), Malta, Luxembourg and...hmmm...the UK.

true,lionmoose,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; Your saying it's not good evidence because the motivation of the governments who increased debt was not to increase it to boost the economy but so that the country to survive.

If one wants to claim the precedent of history (""As a percentage of GDP the UK's National debt is historically speaking very low"") I think it is important to establish whether the circumstance is unique. You can legitimately argue for fiscal expansion to stimulate the economy, but to claim that this has been done before when citing war spending is a little off. 

&gt; But how is that relevant if the outcome of increasing the national debt at that time was not negative?

Because GDP growth was negative in 1944 and 1945 despite increasing debt (by about -4 and -5% respectively). It is not a sure thing that increased government spending leads to increased growth. See also Italy and Japan during the lost decade. 

&gt; America continually reduced tax's and in general spending from the late 1970's onward s 

They have consistently reduced top tax rates. Which is not the same as a reduction in tax take- next to no-one paid the very highest rates historically. Modern top rate bases are very much broader and generally generate more revenue despite lower rates.

&gt; although the income of the top 20% has increased the living standards have decreased for the majority of the population as has disposable income.

Real terms increases in take home income have been growing more slowly (16% since 1975) but not declined.

Another thing is all the players we brought in.

Lamela doesn't seem entirely confident and has been kept out of the side by well performing Lennon and Townsend.

From a variety of different comments on this thread its clear that some people want to see a greater contribution by businesses in terms of tax (or increased wages) and that others think that increasing GDP (make our businesses stronger, among other things?) is our best bet.

I guess the things I would do are

- Educate young people on how they can contribute to their society whether they work retail or in a law firm. This should be a massive focus at college/University level where we expect graduates to earn more. Thus they have greater spending power and learning how to be responsible with this extra wealth could be beneficial. I feel like the education system did not prepare me in ANY way for many aspects of real life.

- Take away benefits and give out food stamps that encourage (give extra) for buying British

- Get British companies to work harder to promote British products

- Get British people consuming seasonal food again. Could we add a tax for non-seasonal goods? Yes people would have to accept that bananas would go up in price but maybe people would consider British more often and could help make British farmers more competitive.

- Get the BBC running adverts. I don't have a TV license (we passed an inspection for not having one) because I don't fancing paying the BBC to rerun Bargain Hunt. Maybe the BBC would become profitable with ads?

In truth, we should probably get our true youth talent out on loan where they can get regular playing time. The regular playing time would benefit them much more than the occasional spot start for us. Especially when you have someone in house who can cover that spot and doesn't need time to develop.

In the summer decide what you are going to do long term, but for now unless you get someone who is desperate for a average backup right back there is no reason to prioritize moving Naughts.

there is no easy answer (sorry).  you need money, and your salary is your only source. unless that changes (money from parents/grants/inheritance/second job), then there isn't much that can be said. let me make some points that you may not have considered (some good/some bad from your perspective):

- buying a 1 bed flat is very ""inefficient"".  a 2 bed flat does not cost double that amount but can house twice as many people (duh!).  you may one day have a significant other/friend you want to move in with, and combining your savings/income should be a huge assistance (assuming they are like you) in getting on the ladder.  Likewise, even if you are flying solo, you could rent a second room to someone to supplement income.
- your salary will increase in time. so if you can keep a lid on your expenditure, you should be able to hit your target quicker than the simple maths might suggest.
- house prices are unlikely to stay the same for 3.5 years.  whether they will be up or down is a big question, but bear in mind the number you need now won't be the number you need then.  likewise the mortgage market will change, so you may be able to get a 5% deposit mortgage in the future or you might need 30%!

true,Larseth,eng-gloucestershire,Gloucestershire,"&gt; Except...it won't. If you use incandensent bulbs on the same day your heating is on then they are 100% efficient. The wasted energy is entirely given off as heat which in the UK is not wasted. This isn't a popular ""opinion"" but it's a fundamental law of thermodynamics. For at least nine months of the year CFLs don't do shit in the UK, we simply run our heating more to make up for the little ""saving"" that was made.

So you are seriously arguing that incandescent bulbs produce enough heat and in the right places to help heat a home? While we are on thermodynamics you will note that heat rises, most bulbs in a house are by the ceiling. Furthermore this assumes that you always want heat when you user the bulb. It is a terrible producer of light and of heat. If you want to use light to heat a room, use the tea light heater, they are far more efficient. The saving is also not little by any means, using a 8 or 11 watt bulb in place of a 40 watt is a huge saving.

&gt; CFLs on the other hand are an environmental catastrophe, we are stuffing landfills full of mercury because they feel the need to downplay the dangers so it doesn't impact adoption rates.

Actually - no. You couldn't be further from the truth.

In areas with coal-fired power stations, the use of CFLs saves on mercury emissions when compared to the use of incandescent bulbs. This is due to the reduced electrical power demand, reducing in turn the amount of mercury released by coal as it is burned.[72] In July 2008 the U.S. EPA published a data sheet stating that the net system emission of mercury for CFL lighting was lower than for incandescent lighting of comparable lumen output. This was based on the average rate of mercury emission for U.S. electricity production and average estimated escape of mercury from a CFL put into a landfill.[73] Coal-fired plants also emit other heavy metals, sulfur, and carbon dioxide.
In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that if all 270 million CFLs sold in 2007 were sent to landfill sites, around 0.13 metric tons of mercury would be released, 0.1% of all U.S. emissions of mercury (around 104 metric tons that year).[74]
The EPA updated their mercury comparison graph in November 2010. The graph assumes that CFLs last an average of 8,000 hours regardless of manufacturer and premature breakage. In areas where coal is not used to produce energy, the content emissions would be less than the power plant emissions for both types of bulb.[75]

&gt; LEDs are great; the law change should have waited until they were mature and banned CFL outright.

While LED's are great and i wish they were the only thing in use CFL's play an important stepping stone due to their lower cost and large energy savings.",0,1389018332,null,0,false,0,ceiojy8,t3_1uj63z,t1_ceiojy8,t1_ceiodax,null,1431822461,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It's a global game with global supporters, and no-one can expect everyone that supports Chelsea to be from London.

But once that decision is made, you just cannot with any kind of dignity swap allegiances just because your side is going through troubled times. It just reeks of childish petulance, like switching off your playstation if you're losing, or flipping over the monopoly board because you just landed on your Mum's hotel-stacked Mayfair. Ultimately, it points to the personality traits of someone who gives up in the face of adversity, is disloyal, and frequently takes the easy way out. I just wouldn't be able to sleep at night.

Oh, and for some - no, it's not just a game. I would also argue that the fans that stay ""regardless of the downturns"" do so not because they make being on top so much sweeter, but because that's what real, true and honest supporters DO.",0,1389018484,null,0,false,0,ceiolbg,t3_1uhgfd,t1_ceiolbg,t1_ceid65i,null,1431822472,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Every team has two different formations, the one they play in possession and the one they revert to when they are out of possession. When Spurs have been out of possession under Sherwood, the two strikers put pressure on the opposition centerbacks and the midfield four gets into a flat bank in front of the defensive line which is also in a flat bank of four and that's a 4-4-2 defensive block boys and girls.

Now when Tottenham get in possession all sorts of things happen, Adebayor tends to drop deep, Soldado either stays high centrally or works the channels, Eriksen tucks in from the left and drifts around, Lennon pushes up high, the fullbacks get into midfield areas out wide and most recently with Bentaleb, one of the two central mids comes deep to help build from the back.

There is no real ""name"" for Spurs possession formation, if you go line by line it would be something like a 2-4-2-1, but it doesn't matter. And if that sounds stupid, Louis van Gaal referred to Barcelona's possession formation as a 2-3-2-3.

But the most recognizable tactical formation a team plays is shown when they defend and they are defending in a 4-4-2 defensive block.

No, I said ""*we simply run our heating more to make up for the little ""saving"" that was made*"", so you are really really pushing it here to twist that. 

&gt; While we are on thermodynamics you will note that heat rises, most bulbs in a house are by the ceiling. 

Just stop now. You don't understand the physics of a closed system. What do you think happens to the heat from a radiator? You clearly just stated that you know heat rises, so in your world radiators don't work either. 

&gt; This is due to the reduced electrical power demand, reducing in turn the amount of mercury released by coal as it is burned.

Which is why we are also switching away from coal. Neither argument has any effect on the other. You don't eliminate something bad only to turn around and say, ""hey, we have some room free in the evil budget, who wants to make a suggestion?"".

&gt;  CFL's play an important stepping stone due to their lower cost and large energy savings.

They bought us two to five years of meaningless savings in domestic lighting which is a fraction of our overall lighting costs which in itself is a fraction of our total energy usage.

true,TJP343,null,null,"The current squad, at full health, is capable of being a top four team over the next two or three seasons if a consistent ""big match 11"" can be put together and that group is given the time needed to play together. Spurs don't really need to go out and spend much in the transfer market after last windows investment, along with the players already in the squad and the players coming through the youth team.

That's the short term, they have a deep enough squad to get into Europe and challenge for trophies. Long term, they need a new stadium to inject more revenue into the team and they need to continue to grow their global brand, which means going abroad every summer, taking advantage of the growing market for EPL football in the States and of course, more consistent success helps grow the brand too.

The stadium is the key, if Spurs had a 50-60k seat stadium they could fill it like they fill the Lane now at 36k seat. Every time they take the pitch at home at WHL they're missing out on 25k of additional ticket sales.

If this financial fair play stuff has the consequences behind it that it seems to have, Chelsea and City will have to curb their spending a great deal and fall back to the pack along with the spending power of Arsenal, Liverpool and United. Which, is still a massive amount of money to use on wages and player purchases, yes, but City and Chelsea have been ridiculous even among the ridiculous.

The best model to look at is sadly, our red shirted friends who happen to occupy the same part of London as the mighty Spurs, they have a large, money generating stadium that is top class, a strong global brand and a consistent way of playing that leads to consistently pursuing the same types of players, which makes working within their budget easier, they're always targeting very specific players.

And Arsenal has that consistency in management that is basically non existent in modern football. Tottenham probably are not going to keep a manager for 15 years, you can't expect that from any manager at any club at this point but Swansea has gone through four managers in their rise from the brink on non League football to playing in Europe. But they continued to bring in managers who adamant about a certain playing style, Roberto Martinez is long gone from Wales but his style of play has lived on and that leads to success.

Consistency in style of play, keeping a group together for 2-3 seasons, a new stadium and the continuing growth of the global brand is the way forward. ",0,1389019935,null,0,false,0,ceioze5,t3_1ujb4x,t1_ceioze5,t3_1ujb4x,null,1431822659,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; So what use is heat during the night when no one is at the office or during the day if someone is not at home?

Heat doesn't just disappear. If the building is so draughty as to loose all of the heat overnight then the problem lies elsewhere. Plus there is far more to the temperature of a room than the air temp, all of the objects act as ""ballast"" and store heat. 

The big issue, as I said, is with offices that run AC. They are using notable amounts of electricity to create heat then move it outside the building and a very Rude Goldberg way. 

&gt; but it is horrible inefficient if you are suggesting that is a benefit.

It's far more ""efficient"" than you realise. The only non-heat usage of energy is in the tiny signal levels of power coming out of the IO ports, a small amount of energy lost through mechanical noise &amp; friction and a small amount of energy to run the fans to move the heat outside of the case. 

Conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, merely converted. That's all your PC does and assuming it doesn't sound like an aircraft carrier (you didn't scrimp on cooling, right?) then it's a not bad little heat producer. If you have two SLI cards you are probably pulling in the region of 600W at max load, most electric heaters are at least double that.

true,Larseth,eng-gloucestershire,Gloucestershire,"&gt; No, I said ""we simply run our heating more to make up for the little ""saving"" that was made"", so you are really really pushing it here to twist that.

You implied that the heat given off is not wasted so it is a benefit. A to the above i say, citation?

&gt; Just stop now. You don't understand the physics of a closed system. What do you think happens to the heat from a radiator? You clearly just stated that you know heat rises, so in your world radiators don't work either.

No, being much larger the radiators have the ability to provide enough heat that it begins to circulate within the room as it rises then cools. I understand the principle perfectly but a bulb would not help in any meaningful way.

&gt; Which is why we are also switching away from coal. Neither argument has any effect on the other. You don't eliminate something bad only to turn around and say, ""hey, we have some room free in the evil budget, who wants to make a suggestion?"".

What? We still use coal, a lot of it. That point would work if coal was a small energy source but it simply isn't.

&gt; They bought us two to five years of meaningless savings in domestic lighting which is a fraction of our overall lighting costs which in itself is a fraction of our total energy usage.

How is it meaningless? Not only does it save people meaningful amounts of money but it has been a tool for weaning people off the energy eating incandescents and halogens until LED's become more affordable. What about their use in industry, retail, offices etc etc etc, they have been used there for many years and subsequently have saved a lot of money and emissions.

&gt; It's a ""lie for children"", just like praying. Leaves people satisfied that they ""made a difference"". Sorry, but them's the truth. You haven't saved the planet, you bought into the con. If you want to make a difference then lobby for minimum efficiency requirements against big industry and the millions of offices around the nation.

No shit it is a drop in the ocean but it is an important drop, funnily enough businesses also use CFL's and have done for a long time so there is no reason domestic properties should not do the same.

I don't even know why you are against them so much? Any benefit is a benefit, no matter how small. Try not to be so negative.

First it was a few big ones, now others are following. Not sure what your point is.

&gt;Most ISPs are issuing an 'active choice' and are telling people how to turn it on and off and all the levels in between.

My understanding was that they're turning it on when you purchase, and expecting you to ask to have it turned off. This is a big difference.

&gt; 'Default-on' is just the propaganda that Cameron decided to announce

At which point, you now have to work through what others have decided is 'normal' before using your new internet connection....because that approach worked *so well* for decades in the UK where the general defence was that looking at *any* porn would lead to the collapse of society (etc.) - an attitude that never had to be defended after we joined the EU and the censorship was taken out of the governments hands (and amazingly, society did not collapse).

In any case, if you think that 'optional' means nothing, you may as well state that making Windows Media Player, Internet Explorer or Bing as defaults makes no difference either. And at least those examples are 'choose me first', not 'choose me but you'll have to call the manufacturer first in order to be allowed to use it if you just bought me'.

Howe cut the top rate from 83 percent to 60 percent. Before the
cut, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid only 11 percent of the
total income tax take. By 1988 they were paying 14 percent of
income tax revenue.
Then Nigel Lawson cut top rates even more, from 60 percent to
40 percent, and receipts rose further. By 1997 the top 1 percent
of earners paid a huge 21 percent of the total tax bill. By more
than halving the top rate of tax from 83 percent to 40 percent,
Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson doubled the proportion of
income tax paid by the top 1 percent of earners.

A more recent example of the same thing would be President Hollande's 70% tax rate in France, which has failed to raise anything like the projected revenue.",0,1389020589,null,0,false,0,ceip67z,t3_1uj5em,t1_ceip67z,t1_ceio2mn,null,1431822748,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Isn't the main reason just that major first-world governments are considered to be far more creditworthy than anyone else, so the government can borrow more cheaply than the PFI consortia can?  Of all the things to privatise, government borrowing has got to be the silliest.

As I understand it, another big problem with PFI deals is that they are very inflexible.  For example, suppose you fund a new school in the traditional way, then a few years later, the number of pupils in the area has fallen and you don't need it any more.  You can just mothball or sell off the school and your expenditure on it drops to zero.  If you fund a school with a PFI scheme, you are typically locked in to paying for the management and maintenance of the school for decades (because the pretense is that this is *all* you are paying for, but in reality most of the fee goes to paying off your debt).",0,1389021537,null,0,false,0,ceipgiw,t3_1uj6mb,t1_ceipgiw,t1_ceinju7,null,1431822908,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Note how it mentions that all waste is given off as IR (i.e. heat). The lumouns efficiency is low which is what most folk talk about. In California or the south of Spain this is a huge issue, not so much in the UK. 

&gt; I understand the principle perfectly but a bulb would not help in any meaningful way.

It would and the above link confirms this. Heat circulates and averages out on it's own. If you have radiators plus incandescent lighting then it works very well. The link does mention that some space heating can be cheaper, which I already mentioned as gas heating is much cheaper than electric. It's not any more environmentally efficient though, that is purely a cost benefit to the user.

Hardly seems fair. They were taxed on earning that money. And if they inherited it, it was taxed there too. They're also taxed on anything they make from their £400k too. These sudden levy ideas are scary and massively undermine confidence in the country. When Cyprus did it, it was worldwide news.

Petrodollars and the willingness to spend them (Chelsea, City)

2 - A long-term, big-money sponsor
3 - Multiple CL years
4 - Winning with style
5 - Aggressive overseas marketing

1 - A bigger stadium equals more ticket sales.  Also increases the perception of being a ""big"" club.

2 - Having a guaranteed revenue stream for multiple years adds dollars (obviously), but also increases perceptions that the club is ""big.""  No Wonga's here.

3 - Gotta be on the big stage.  Without that, you cannot be considered a credible big team, especially coming out of England.

4 - Make the highlight reels.  Have your club be a destination for players who want to win and get famous.

5 - Everyone in England who is a fan already has a team to support (although studies have shown, team support is more fluid that people think).  Need to get Americans and Asians onboard the Spur bandwagon.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;You appear to be confusing anti-competitive (monopolistic in this case) practices with moral issues.

Only if you don't consider that I might be giving a parallel of offering something as a default and considering it restrictive (as everyone did with MS).

&gt;Um, the examples you used are not.

Um, you're ignoring the EU ruling to a) *offer* alternatives, b) the ruling to create Windows N (The EU is rather large to call 'very specific'), and c) the further ruling that new editions had to offer the browser choice out of the box (which MS 'forgot about' before getting fined again).

&gt;What do they represent?

The decisions made on your behalf on what you see, which is why such a fuss was made.

&gt;So why did they do it - and why is none of the media asking this question - why is all they care about is strawman comparisons to Orwell and censorship rather than looking at the legislative-less causes?

Because the Gov. wasn't going to quit until they complied - certainly once other countries did so and with the restrictions as they stand, the Gov (and the ISP's) can fall back on the what-about-the-children argument - the point is not the change itself, but how it creates the thin-end of a wedge that hadn't existed. Ultimately the only way an ISP could have continued offering an open service in the long term would be to offer it from abroad, and even then we'd be into legal leapfrogging to stop it - but that won't happen because the ISP's can always point any queries at the Gov. over having to defend their actions, and ultimately it's the Gov. that this sort of thing should be directed at, rather than blaming the companies involved for not putting up a fight.",0,1389023303,null,0,false,0,ceiq1dy,t3_1uj7c6,t1_ceiq1dy,t1_ceipnr0,null,1431823189,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I think it is somewhat problematic to use a foreign reference, but I will let you have it since it's culturally similar, EU based and I enjoy a challenge.

Firstly, I must concede that yes, that was legal action, brought by a BPI equivalent against an ISP. However the facts of the case do bare relevance, and that is that it came down to a contractual issue rather than one based in IP law, since they had no legal standing to enforce their desires - which is a massive loss for the IRMA. As such the contract only applied to a single ISP rather than each Irish ISP. And even then the final result seems to be somewhat up in the air.

Corporations can sue whoever they like whenever they like. What would be good to know in this particular case, is why Eircom made any concession at all.

true,willmorgan,null,null,"I'm in the same situation as you. After saving aggressively for some time, I've decided to take a step back and use my money to enjoy myself more. Here is why:

6 months ago, I was about 8 months away from being able to buy at the prices then.

I'm now 12 months away from being able to buy at the current prices, while keeping up the same rate of savings.

There are various factors hurting you and I:

* The government's Help to Buy initiative
* An ongoing housing crisis with a severe lack of new homes
* Foreign investors buying up property for security

I'm now more like 12 months away from being able to afford anything, and every month I save, the wait gets longer.

So about 2 months ago, I thougth ""sod it"" and eased up on aggressive house deposit spending. The result is I'm a bit more chilled out and less anxious about things.

These are London rates, btw, so I could buy almost anywhere else in the country if I wanted to relocate.

3.5 years is a long time. As others have said, there are other nice wins you can come across like bonuses, salary increases, etc. I'm on my own in saving too, and the best advice I can give is to work hard to get paid a lot, but don't slave away working for a mortgage that you'll eventually be a slave to anyway.",0,1389024045,null,0,false,0,ceiqatw,t3_1ujaw0,t1_ceiqatw,t3_1ujaw0,null,1431823320,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

You really ought to have made that clear. I think its an unfair comparison to make. The filters, unlike the software you mention, forces you into a choice. The software made the choice for you until later legal enforcements changed the situation in certain cases.

A better comparison would be compare the filters to the later Windows EU releases where you are forced into CHOOSING a browser.

&gt;Um, you're ignoring the EU ruling to a) offer alternatives, b) the ruling to create Windows N (The EU is rather large to call 'very specific'), and c) the further ruling that new editions had to offer the browser choice out of the box (which MS 'forgot about' before getting fined again).

I didn't ignore that at all. Infact that was my very point - that you used examples of things which were 'choose me first' which were actually 'shipped by default' until the EU ruling, when you obviously meant to do the opposite. I would also call Windows N very specific to the EU. Sorry if that offends you but it is nevertheless true.

&gt;The decisions made on your behalf on what you see, which is why such a fuss was made.

In regards to the recent filtering implementation said decisions are only made on your behalf if you opt to have them made on your behalf - you have to give consent.

&gt;Because the Gov. wasn't going to quit until they complied

Sorry. I don't accept that. The Digital Communications Data Bill is just around the corner, which they already took a stand against. Why would they give in now with that around the corner?

&gt;could have continued offering an open service in the long term would be to offer it from abroad

Fallacy. Operating from abroad gives no special protection from our law when the service goes through the UK at some point. Physical assets could still be seized or operating companies (i.e. Openreach) compelled to cooperate.

&gt;ultimately it's the Gov. that this sort of thing should be directed at

See here is where I disagree strongly. I blame the Government for pandering to DM voters, sure. I blame the Government for interfering with corporations when there was no legal basis to do so, and without any sort of democratic mandate.

But to clarify, I meant the eventual top 3 is not clear. It's clear now, yes, that those three teams are tops in the league. But Scum are, in my opinion, playing above their potential at the moment.

They've won so many games this campaign that could easily have gone to a draw or even in the other direction.

City play lights out at home but have been utter shit when playing away. And West London scum are coming into form, but they are still vulnerable.

On the other hand, Spurs are coming into their own and are in their best form of the season in the Premier League, and Liverpool are having their best campaign in years, led by lights-out Suarez. Everton are punching above their weight, but have yet to show any major cracks in the facade.

true,XlPoLaR04,num23,,"BALEEEEE!!!!!! I'm sorry i had to.....

Anyway I think if we look at the team we are lacking in two crucial areas. left back and left mid/wing. (Coincidentally where our greatest export used to play.) The reason behind that is that after Bale left sure we spent the money we got however we didn't put it into replacing what he gave us.

I'm not gonna say that we will ever be able replace or replicate the kind of player that Gareth is. However we might be able to add together the pieces with multiple players. The biggest thing I see missing that he gave us was his electrifying pace. We don't currently have a player outside of Walker that could've even held a candle to Gareth. 

That is actually an interesting thing to look at as the LM/LW spot is traditionally around the world where pace is found. Ronaldo, Reus, Schurrle, Willian, Podolski, Hazard, Ribery, Neymar....etc. All of these players are world class and one of the biggest reasons is that they can stretch defenses with their ridiculous pace. 

Following that due to his crazy pace (and his roots as a defensive player) Gareth would and could very capably track back to help out in the left side of defense. Which kind of stifled the need for a better LB then Benny. 

So if we look at what we lost with Bale; pace, play making ability, goal scoring, and a box to box player. Then what we got back plenty of play making ability from Eriksen and hopefully the same out of Lamela once he's fit. Goals, they aren't really coming yet, hopefully Soldado and Ade keep going as they have been doing better than we were at the start of the year. Box to box, I would say that is Paulinho in a nutshell, very good going both ways with the flow of play. 

In summary, the two big things that we are still missing from the loss of Gareth are Pace, and the left side of our team. I think if we figure that out we have a wonderfully capable team. We have easily the second best keeper in the PL (I would say contending for first as Chelsea's defense helps out Cech quite a bit.) We have one of the best CB's in England with Jan. We have a wonderfully athletic right back in Walker. Our central midfield is just stacked with too many names to count and probably the best CAM under 23 behind Gotze with Eriksen. Our Right side is solid and will only get better as Lamela finds fitness and form. and our strike force is definitely capable. 

TL;DR: We lost Bale and didn't replace his pace or his presence on the left. If we find those two things Spurs will be in a much better place. ",0,1389026953,null,0,false,0,ceirfcn,t3_1ujb4x,t1_ceirfcn,t3_1ujb4x,null,1435536614,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

true,Kesuke,null,null,"errrr... actually that speech made Enoch Powell one of the most popular but divisive politicians of the time. The speech and the media attention it received was credited as part of reason behind the surprisingly strong performance of the Heath government at the following 1970 general election. In 1974 at the next election Powell turned his back on Heaths conservative government and endorsed instead the labour party - who ultimately won the 1974 election (at that point the labour party were less keen on European integration than they are now). It's been argued that the loss of those votes contributed significantly to Heaths defeat. 

What Powell did lose was his job as shadow defense secretary though in all honesty it would have been very unlikely that he would have been defense secretary in the 1970s government anyway, even if he had not made the speech - since he and Edward Heath didn't see eye to eye, particularly given Heaths views on European integration and Powell being the archetypal anglo-american focused, eurosketpical, conservative MP. Heath probably only kept him around due to his extensive power base of voters - in a somewhat similar way to how David Cameron probably tolerates Michael Goves presence in the cabinet, because he is a powerful individual within the conservative party.

Powell remained an MP until he lost his seat at the 1987 general election - by which point he was already in his late 70s, and he died about 10 years later in the late 90s.",0,1389026984,null,0,1389027388,0,ceirfrx,t3_1uhnfp,t1_ceirfrx,t1_ceimqoz,null,1431823815,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

People are generally pretty nice, which makes going to London that much more of a shock!

A big adjustment for me has been learning how to interact with British people. It really is a different culture here from North America. I've come to learn that us Americans generally share a lot with people we've just met. Here, you might know someone for years and they still won't totally open up to you.

I've had mostly positive experiences. One or two instances of people basically telling me that I shouldn't live in Britain since I'm not British. But, that's rare. It was weird adjusting to the idea of being a ""foreigner"".

Not sure how much you know about British culture in general, but I found the transition really fun at first. I remember the first times I heard people say things like, ""knickers"" or ""whaddya fancy?"" or starting conversations with ""you alright?"".

It may be that you're picking up signal off the wrong transmitter - as a rough guide, if your aerial is pointing in the same direction as everyone else's nearby then you're probably not going far wrong.

Furthermore, if you're in a fringe area then you may need a different aerial, one with higher gain. If you've got a cheap no-frills aerial, then you'll be fine if you've got the transmitter on your doorstep, but might struggle further out.

If you're really struggling, then it might be a good idea to get the local aerial people to have a look - they normally have a good idea of what works in which area.

It must be mutually beneficial for companies to pay tax, with incentives that also benefit the long term national interest. Employment schemes, company welfare, less reliance on imported goods, environmental considerations, education programs etc. If you reduce the need for redistribution through tax then you can also reduce tax overall and encourage mutually positive benefits for businesses at the same time.

However each country is also strongly motivated to cheat/defect - if everyone else agrees to cut emissions, but your country actually increases them then you gain extra GDP growth. But then because every country is motivated to defect, you can assume every country will defect which means that every country exceeds emissions hoping to increase GDP growth.

That episode became ""Blink"". The episode was so popular that they've brought back the Angels several times, and they've gotten less and less interesting each time. No more Angels!



Thank god someone agrees, it seems Moffat took an enemy that is only successful when you dont think about it too hard and decided that the only way to keep it interesting is by jamming  as many as they can in one episode. The statue of liberty angel is up there on the stupidest and most pointless thing I have ever watched list, they spent so much time not looking at it.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"I think there is one thing your wrong about. We can force EU migrants to leave if they don't get a job. They can stay for 3 months where they are untouchable but after that time they must show that they have a reasonable chance of getting a job. In the UK also they must pass the habitual residence test to show they are properly resident in the UK. This test is being argued in the European Court of Justice I think so it may be over turned. Either way it's not strictly true that an EU migrant can come and not work - at least not for longer than 3 months. EU law tends to be pretty lenient to allow people to genuinely search for a job and get an opportunity to genuinely contribute so you can understand people having concerns but it's certainly not the case that someone can sponge off the system for years with no job. 

As you say the benefit system is universal and allows claims from day one. I'm most certainly not on the Conservative's side on these topics but I would have no problem with a contribution based system - it's perfectly fair especially where resources (i.e. money) are scarce. Plus the EU would be totally fine with it - we know because it's totally fine with the rest of Europe doing it. If what the government say is true ([they have provided no evidence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24522653) for widespread benefit tourism so it doesn't seem to be) then they could just change it.

* Reduce the military to a border defence capacity. Western governments haven't intervened in a conflict for a justifiable reason for 68 years, and their record before that is patchy at best. A large proportion of the savings will be spent on public works. Military personnel will be guaranteed jobs, preferably skill-appropriate ones.

* Change the law so that companies cannot legally operate in the UK unless they have a UK HQ through which their taxes are filed. No more funnelling off revenue to PO Boxes in Luxembourg for 'intellectual property licensing'. If Vodafone or whatever decide to bail, fuck them. Someone will step up and take their place so long as there is a demand for the service.

* Kill the use of contracted private businesses to provide public services. If they are profiting from providing public services, we are being ripped off. 

* End contracts for supplies to public services, central government, councils etc. If a government department has an obligation to purchase from one private, profit-driven supplier, *of course* that supplier is going to start charging £20 for USB cables.

From http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/apply/requirements/

&gt; With the exception of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, there are no GCSE (or equivalent) requirements for entry to Cambridge.

&gt; GCSE results are looked at as a performance indicator, but within the context of the school/college performance.

&gt; It is generally expected that applicants will have achieved high grades in subjects relevant to their chosen course, and most students who apply have at least four or five As or A*s at GCSE. However, there are always exceptions and one of the strengths of the Cambridge admissions system is its ability to assess all applicants individually.

By ""performance indicator"" it is meant that a candidate getting three As from a school where fewer than one third get above a C is a strong indicator of strong performance whereas a candidate getting the same three As from a school where close to 100% get above a C is less of an indicator of strong performance but it is *not* an indicator of weak performance.

Specific statistics on success rates based on A-Level results can be found on page 9 of http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/publications/docs/admissionsstatistics2012.pdf.

An interactive plot of admissions statistics grouped by both course and college is available at http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/apply/statistics/

true,MeddlingMike,flair8,,"The rest of the guys have made some great points. I just wanted to expand a bit on it.

One of the biggest differences between American Sports and the BPL is the complete lack of a salary cap or financial regulation. Imagine baseball if there was no luxury taxes or compensatory picks of any kind. The Steinbrenners could go out and buy up every single high price tag player they want without worrying about how much of that money is going directly into the pocket of the owner of the Houston Astros. They don't have to sell out their draft picks in order to sign free agents that have had qualifying offers made to them. It's a much purer game in terms of financial regulation, but it's created a significant gap between the haves and the have nots. Manchester City is owned by an Arab Shiekh, Chelsea is owned by a Russian Oil Billionaire. Spurs have a wealthy ownership group, but they are swimming in a very big pond with very many big fish. When we don't make the Champions league and we can't offer our star players the opportunity to play at the highest levels of competition we have to sell to bigger clubs when they come knocking. This has cost us some key players over the years. Most recently was Gareth Bale, but the same happened with Luka Modric and Dimitar Berbatov before him. Imagine if your player won the MVP award in the regular season and you barely missed the playoffs. Now you have to sell him at the end of the season to a playoff team because he wants to play in the playoffs. We do the same thing on a lesser scale. We got Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen from Ajax. We broke our tranfer fee record 3 times in the last trading window when we bought Paulinho, Roberto Soldado and Erik Lamela using the funds we acquired from selling Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for an exorbitant amount of money.

TL;DR: We're high on the food chain, but we're not on the top. That can be both frustrating and exciting at times.

The other thing that I feel is different about the BPL from American Sports that hasn't been covered here is that for a BPL club there are distinct levels of winning and losing, usually formed by the expectations that are had for your team before the season starts. If you don't win the champions league, you could win the BPL. If you don't win the BPL, you could finish top 4 of the BPL to qualify for champions league next season. If you don't qualify for the Champions League, you could qualify for Europa League. If you don't qualify for Europa League you could avoid relegation and stay in the BPL. If you get relegated, you could still win the league cup or the FA cup. It happens to some extent in american sports, but it's all sort of a pride thing. If you lose in the Super Bowl you get a conference championship trophy/ring that nobody really cares about, the 31st overall pick in the draft and a bucket of ""what-if's"" for your trouble. A number of these tiers of winning in English football have some financial ramifications attached to them which can help you build your club and attract better players going forward.",0,1389031829,null,0,1389033230,0,ceitl3r,t3_1uhmwt,t1_ceitl3r,t3_1uhmwt,null,1431824841,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Reina, being a former Barcelona player and having been linked quite heavily with a move back for some time, supposedly told Brendan that he wanted to go if Barcelona did come calling. With Reina on big wages, getting on a little bit in terms of age and having not had a particularly great season, this wasn't the worst situation in the world as it gave us the opportunity to invest in a new young keeper (obviously we chose Mignolet). 

However quite late in the day, Valdes announced he was ~~signing a new contract~~ staying with Barcelona, and this left Liverpool with two first choice goalkeepers both on decent wages. I don't know to what extend we 'touted' out Reina for loan, but once Napoli made an offer it made sense for both parties that he should go out on loan. For Reina, it was an opportunity to get first team football and reunite with a manager he knew well in Benitez. For Liverpool, it meant we got some of Reina's wages off the books and wouldn't have to deal with the awkward situation of benching one of them every week. 

It's been assumed for a while now that we'll probably not see Reina in a Liverpool shirt again, especially with Mignolet being a success so far, but a lot will depend on whether there are any takers for him in the summer.

If you're not in a position to get somewhere else then you need to get to the housing offices at the foot of Cockburn Street stat. Provided you aren't intentionally homeless then the council has a duty to house you however what they'll do is put you on the housing list with Silver priority and arrange for you to stay in a B&amp;B. The B&amp;Bs are shite and certain ones such as the one at the foot of Leith Links are notorious for theft, drug taking etc. Being on the housing list means that even with silver priority you will be waiting eight months to a year to get housed in even a shitty area and if you're offered a flat and don't take it then you will lose your position on the housing list unless you've got very good reason for not taking the place offered. 

If you've got some kind of medical condition, mental health condition etc then bring this up as it could get you into temporary supported accommodation instead of a B&amp;B and the supported accommodation is usually very nice - when I was homeless I had to go into the Royal Ed for two weeks for treatment and used that to get myself into the hostel at Bruntsfield Place overlooking the Links and stayed there for eight months. However, there aren't many places in temporary supported accommodation in the city plus you'll have to pay a service charge whilst you're in them. Lie about your health conditions if you have to - it's worth it to avoid getting dumped in a B&amp;B.

Another thing to think about doing is claiming Employment and Support Alllowance even if you don't have a health condition that prevents you from working. You'll be able to get away with that for theee months until you have to do the medical. You won't get any more money than JSA but it will get the Jobcentre off your back for a while which is particularly important as the Jobcentre will not go easy on you just because you're homeless and they will give you requirements to fulfil in order to get your money that are almost impossible to satisfy at which point they'll sanction you. The jobcentre genuinely don't give a shit if you're homeless. Plus getting a job is a nightmare if you're homeless and if you do get one you'll end up having to cover some or all of the cost of tour temporary accommodation in a B&amp;B which is not cheap else you'll be out on the streets.

true,chamatielly,null,null,"&gt;Well you need to separate it. Firearms deaths are a completely different thing. Outlawing firearms has prevented many mass killings, (which can't really be done with knives etc) and legalising them again will not affect knife crime.

The point is that even when handguns were legal mass killings were very rare.

We had a massacre in Hungerford which was in 1987, we had another massacre in 1996 and finally another in 2010.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland

So up until 1987, mass killings were almost unheard of here. The only ones you could say that occured in regular frequency happened in Northern Ireland and were perpetuated by terrorists with illegal guns as part of a civil war.


&gt;The question is how do we limit knife crime? Randomly legalising firearms will do nothing to change this. **If anything, crime will increase.**

I find this extremely hard to believe because homicides rose for a couple of years after handguns were banned only to decline to the same level as the pre-ban period until many years afterwards.

Allowing handguns to licensed individuals will have very little effect on crime.

The LHAs aren't in the business of forcibly evicting people based on arbitrary criteria, and neither should they be. Human rights courts tend to look down on people being driven out of their homes.

In my view there should be incentives for people to move to accommodation that suits them, not threats and penalizations. The same goes for the bedroom tax - encouraging people to come forward if they feel their house is underoccupied and rewarding them with priority status on lists for new, more appropriate housing would be far more effective at easing strain on the system in my view. I am sure there are plenty of older people in council estate suburbs with empty bedrooms formerly occupied by their long since moved-out children who would love to live nearer town centres with their friends.

I completely agree with you about seasonal food. We should also be growing things in our communities. Food production is becoming increasingly efficient and high tech, extending growing seasons, reducing need for imports, producing better quality varierties - all of which is great, and I think that trend could revolutionise local produce in a few years. Gardens and allotments could be enormously productive with a little tweaking and some incentives. 

The problem with education, has been, as I see it, a failure to reward individual contribution. Learning must be in a positive, rewarding environment, a place of inspiration, discovery and wonder. If the goal is to create citizens who will contribute to society, surely we must reward our children for taking the initiative and working hard towards their own goals, instead of homogenizing everyone within the same dull curriculum and then expecting them to suddenly map out their individual paths at 17. I'm 24 now and feel like a maladjusted adult with no transferable skills or, more worryingly, personal ambition. Academies are a good idea, I think they will be vindicated in a few years. Primary education is also moving in the right direction, although there is still far too much assessment and not enough emphasis on experiences and fostering good behaviour, work ethic and individual curiosity. And again, the reason why our children find it hard adjusting to adult life is because they are protected from it rather than trusted to thrive and adapt early. It's about experiencing and overcoming challenges - and failures - at a young age. We talk about robbing children of their childhood - but the best childhood is one where the child has the freedom to impersonate an adult and actually learn some important lessons. The coming of age has been compressed into too few years when it should be started earlier.

For the taxing, I've got a simpler solution, but you'll disagree with me on the 50% tax thing.  Tax any income, regardless of source, at the same rate.  Dividends from shares?  Tax it the same as income.  This would mean we could abolish Corperation Tax whilst taxing many people more efficently (ie raising more tax).

- Child could be born in or outside of the UK.

- Child could be born before or after parents arriving in the UK.

- Parent(s) could have been naturalised to British citizens

- What about British kids living in Spain, should their benefit be withdrawn too?

- Both parents and child can have dual citizenship.

- Children might be abroad just temporarily, while parents get through the hardship.

- Children of parents who are in the UK will most likely stay with the closest family (who else would look after them). At which point it becomes permanent as opposed to holiday/family stay?

- If both parents work in the UK and pay taxes in the UK, why would Polish (or any other) government pay towards care?

- If both parents work in the UK (even on min. wage) they can afford to send the equivalent of child benefits back home from their own pocket, but should they?


Having said that, I don't agree with neither of the sides of this argument. I've no solution.

(Not saying this is fact, but as union leader, they tend to be Socialist leaning types) 

I've met people in the past who refuse to live anywhere besides Co-ops or social housing out of a greater social responsibility, it's a political attack against private property or allowing others to gain wealth from another's hard work. Where as paying money into the public sector will theoretically reward the public and greater good more, if managed responsibly. 

Your position is based purely on capitalist stand point, where as I'm merely saying ""look at the other angle here"", to accuse him of being irresponsible is very one sides and is a refusal to accept other ideas exist which are sometimes looked at, as a more moral final outcome. 

Personally if I was Mr Crow, I'd probably setup a Co-op my self and start introducing the concept far more widely within the UK, as there are not enough of them and this would be one way of restoring a more responsible social housing policy.

The thing is, he didn't say that, and instead bought votes on the idea that he wouldn't allow student fees to rise, which they did.

I can't say I have the solution to the university issue, because I'm not clever enough and any ideas I do come up with will inevitably be shot down. For example: Incentivising people to do degrees in subjects that are likely to result in jobs like Medicine by making tuition fees lower or providing other goodies to them. Degrees that don't provide much in terms of economic benefit like puppetry or gender studies would have higher tuition fees because you're not going to be relying on those people to pay back into the fund with taxes. I wager not a lot of puppetry graduates are going to be making over £100k a year and sitting in that lovely 40% tax bracket. If people want to do a degree in puppetry, that's fine, but they would be made to pay more because their degree is essentially worthless in the grand scheme of things.

That solution is of course flawed and filled with my own bias. Who decides what degrees are worthless? What would stop the wages of doctors going down when every graduate is going for medicine etc?

Two of my friends are Scottish Redditors who avoid /r/scotland like the plague and particularly avoid talking about independance because they do not enjoy engaging with the arguments and discussions there.

Reddit can be a pretty horrible place if you dare to disagree with the hivemind, meaning that the only people who respond end up being trolls, less smart people and people who become quick to anger.

I avoid talking Scottish Independance as having seen the Tory campaign in Perth I am aware that Scottish Nationalists response to English right-wingers talking politics with them is not the best way of getting reasonable discussions started.

So, I'm afraid it is almost certain that you will go on not getting a balanced or accurate discussion.

Economic competition had turned into competition for territories, and the outcome depended on armed might. No state could afford to back down once the chain of confrontations had been set off by the Sarajevo assassination, because no state could risk a weakening of its global strength. The same imperialism which had stimulated economic growth and a belief in the inevitability of progress was now to tear the heart of Europe apart.

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"But as you say, it's about scarcity. Not about physical effort.

If you're doing a job that anyone else could do, there's more competition for your job; you're at greater risk of being replaced by someone cheaper or faster or whatever.

If you're involved in the production of low-price/low-value goods, then your wages are going to be low no matter how good you are, unless you're on piece rates and work like a superhero.

So if there are another 100 million people who could do the same work, you're basically fucked. I'm not gloating. I'm not being smug. That's just how it is.

If you want to know, I work in IT, developing software, using skills that took me over twenty years to acquire; and I'm still learning, because in my industry if you stand still too long, the stuff you know becomes worthless. So I'm constantly trying to develop my skills. Maybe you think that's lazy. I don't.

**Edit:**  
I've already lost a job to a company in Mumbai that could do the work cheaper, so I'm not immune to this kind of thing. I didn't bleat about protecting British jobs or controlling the borders. I got another job before the redundancies came, where my skills were still needed.

**Edit #2:**  
I grew up in an area that was already - well not exactly flooded, but heavily populated - with north Asians. I'm okay with it. It's never bothered me.

Right now the area where I live is seeing more and more Polish and Baltic people. I want to use the ""Polskie sklepy"" because it's much the same stuff I've often bought in Lidl. But I want to learn some more Polish first so I don't look like a tit when I walk in.

**It's league football. Every team plays every team twice (once at home, once away). To win you have to finish top of the league. Finish in the top 5 and you qualify for European competition in the next season (top 4 places = Champions League, fifth place = Europa League) **

**There are also two knock-out cup competitions. So overall, you still get a mix.**

I feel that this is very similar because it involves text and pictures.  The pictures aren't necessary, but they are nice.

Then there is this one: http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1twc2z/moffat_on_doctor_who/
I actually posted this first to /r/DoctorWhumour because I was very sure you would take it down.  It was then x-posted here.

To look WAY in the past there is this one : http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/143u8z/why_queen_elizabeth_didnt_like_the_doctor/

I actually posted this a couple months before this successful post and it was taken down.  In fact, if you look at the name of the tumblr you can see that it is a repost. 

Finally, there is this post which is currently the top of all time: http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1rwrja/tom_bakers_wonderful_response_when_asked_his_one/

This is just text, a while ago I posted something similar and was told that I would have to post it a text post.

I understand that some of you think that I ""karma whore"", but the usual definition of that is to repost things you know are reposts or use heart wrenching titles for things that aren't true.  I do none of these things, I try very hard not to repost and I do my best to find content that I believe the community will enjoy or that will stimulate and better the community.  I love this community and I love being a part of it, karma has nothing to do with it, at this point I really don't care about it at all.

The most important thing that Spurs need to do is to try and hold on to their current crop of players and let them have some time to develop. Just because things haven't gone quite right Spurs this season does not mean that theiir squad is not upto to a top 4 challenge or even a title challenge.

Honestly speaking, given the current squad at Tottenham; if they are all even at their average best, they can be one of the best teams in Europe. I mean come on, players like Dawson, Vertonghen, Holtby, Eriksen, Lamela, Ade, etc. etc... any top team in Europe would be more than glad to have players like these in their squad.

Even though I hate you guys to the guts, but for all those who are laughing at you right now (me included); it might come back and bite us in the arse.

I dont know much about the new stadium that Spurs are planning; but if the plan goes ahead.. then the success of it depends on the vision of the manager you guys have. Which I think that Sherwood has.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"Wales has its own government and a cabinet minister too, their voice is even louder.

Cornwall (as with most of the south west) is a place where Labour will never win big, so they ignore us, and where the Conservatives tend to be well entrenched in their safe seats, so they pretend to care until after the election.

&gt; Actually that is. And I oppose it.

Did you miss a word? I don't know what this means.

&gt; From speaking to a few engineers working on the FTTC roll out, they moved from rolling out exchanges which they activated based on estimated demand and cost, to doing ones in Cornwall first. 

I would assume that Superfast Cornwall has deadlines to meet that BT had to keep to, whereas the commercial rollout is entirely BT's decision, so letting it slip isn't a big deal. They didn't seem to have much trouble working simultaneously in Cornwall and in Plymouth, I saw a lot of fibre cabinets pop up in both places at the same time.

I can't speak for everywhere but in my village they went for what I suspect is the largest cabinet first, mine, and it took them an entire year to come back and install some FTTP and a few remaining FTTC cabinets.

I don't see how this is outrageous, if it's true.

&gt; My parents cabinet apparently has 5 people on it! Good use of government money.

I don't know if BT would bother if it really had 5 people on the cab since the fibre cabinets can support 144 or 288 lines, but I don't work for BT and don't plan these things. They certainly aren't putting them everywhere, quite a few places now have moved to the stage where ""other alternatives are being considered"". Including my village (which is mostly FTTC with some FTTP).

From a technical perspective FTTC is much nicer than the LTE or satellite that they seem to be planning for the real back of beyond. Wouldn't you rather BT installed FTTC for you if your line was on that cabinet?

The programme is still 60% funded by BT so any waste of money is primarily of their own. At least the ""waste"" has still delivered a reasonable result.",0,1389040447,null,0,1389040705,0,ceixro7,t3_1uh6cw,t1_ceixro7,t1_ceilzgi,null,1431826866,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; So that's two big asks that Scotland has, neither of which has ever been given before.

New member states do not need to adopt the Euro: there are currently 11 EU members not in the Eurozone, only two of which have a formal opt-out (Denmark and the UK).

Members need to commit to joining the Euro when they meet the [convergence criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria), however those criteria include two years prior membership of ERM II - membership of which is [entirely voluntary](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/erm2/index_en.htm).

Both Ireland and the UK received an opt-out over Schengen. Given that Scotland is currently opted out of Schengen via the UK, and its only land border would be shared with another opted-out country, whether Scotland was in Schengen or not would make no material difference to any other EU member.

As such it seems quite unlikely that there would be objections to giving Scotland this opt-out too.

&gt; Scotland getting back into the EU is far from a certainty, in fact at the moment its not even looking very likely.

Your assumption seems to be that Scotland would actually leave the EU?

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"Here in Bristol it is phenomenally good, we are spoilt for choice with the Tobacco factory, The Wickham Theatre, The Brewery Theatre, The Bristol Old Vic, the Bristol Hippodrome, the little black box and a multitude of small and impromptu venues, whether that be the room above a pub for amateur dramatics or the Zoological gardens for some outdoor Shakespeare. 

We do not feel ourselves to be poor cousins to London at all, the alumni who were trained at *our* old Vic include Brian Blessed, Olivia Coleman, Daniel Day-Lewis, Pete Postlethwaite, Miranda Richardson, Patrick Stewart, Gene Wilder and many others. 

There is a real sense that you can pay a fraction of what a London theatre ticket would cost, get a decent seat in a beautiful, compact and intimate theatre and be able to see student or up and coming actors of real calibre who may well be Oscar or Laurence Olivier or Bafta award winners in a few years time. As well as polished veterans who just happen to prefer living in Beautiful Bristol to anywhere else. 

There is always an eclectic mix of choices available, from big budget Musicals imported from Broadway or the West End at the hippodrome to innovative high-tech children's story telling through puppetry at the Brewery. It might be a handful of actors and a few props creating a minimalist dramatisation of Jane Eyre or a splendid and extravagant Shakespeare history.  

Perhaps because we are provincial there is a real sense of freedom and scope for experimentation, because there is less pressure on venues to put on sure-fire hits.  

One terrific example from 2011 was the Old Vic's production of Treasure Island, rather than letting the fact that the Vic was closed for refurbishment put a damper on things they transformed the [façade of the building in to a pirate-ship stage](http://www.independent.co.uk/migration_catalog/article5315276.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/Pg-13-Treasure-Island.jpeg) and incorporated the local environs, the seagulls and passers by and sounds of the city in to each performance. Of course it helped that the Theatre Royal where the Old Vic is based happens to be a grand mid 18th century building,  within a stone's throw of the harbour and the Hole in the Wall Pub which is meant to have been the inspiration for Stevenson's fictional Spyglass Tavern. 

The audiences are just as diverse as the performances, theatre attendance here is not limited to the middle aged and middle class as it can be in some areas, the affordability and range of high quality shows available means that you will see many people who you would not automatically assume to be theatre goers. 

There is a strong connexion between the theatres and the companies and public engagement, with frequent back stage open days and workshops.  

I think the best way to summarise is to say that I felt famished for theatre when I lived in North Wales for a few years, in Bristol we almost take it for granted that we should be able to see everything from classical plays with professional actors to experimental performances by the student theatre companies on any night of the week. 

I didn't personally vote for him but our Elected Mayor (we have a Lord Mayor also) was the architect behind the regeneration of the Tobacco factory theatre and that was an integral part of his campaign, because  we treasure our theatre culture.

I was speaking to a friend of mine today who is a red and what he said really rang true. He was explaining how most united fans can now understand (at least to a degree) how we felt for all those years living in their shadow. 

A lot now understand how it feels to fear playing us home or away, how they envy our squad and how to some degree we're becoming 'Manchester'. For years, foreign players referred to united simply as Manchester, we were the forgotten brother, the Phil to their Gary Neville if you will. 

Never did I think I'd find myself buying a ticket to an away leg against Barcelona never mind thinking about winning that tie or having world class players like Aguero, Silva or Kompany at our club. For years we were a footballing graveyard, where players would come to see out the last few years of their careers, now they come to reach the pinnacle of their footballing days at our club.

It still feels like I'm dreaming sometimes. I don't think I'll ever become accustomed to this feeling of success and that's what will separate us from other 'big' clubs we'll savour our success and not throw our toys out of the pram when we lose. We'll be humble.

But the players, the big European footballing nights and the success wouldn't be here without one man and he will forever be a club legend. Mr Mansour, we love you.

true,Torque_Tonight,null,null,"Excellent input there. I would have thought my comment fell into the category of stating the obvious, but here goes.

Let's consider renting versus buying a modest property worth £100,000. That could be a studio flat down south or basic house up north.

First, renting. A property worth £100k would probably rent for about £650 per month. That is £7800 per year giving a yield of 7.8% which is quite reasonable. Yields of over 10% are possible in some areas: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/10257398/Cities-offering-the-biggest-returns-to-landlords.html
Over the course of 5 years you would pay £39k in rent. So in the rental case your position after 5 years is -£39000.

Now buying. Let's say you put down £5000 as a 5% deposit, borrow £20k 20% from the government help to buy scheme and take a mortgage for the remaining £75k 75%: http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/offers/help-to-buy/?WT.mc_id=PPC__Google__National&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;srchpterm=+help++to++buy&amp;srchengine=google&amp;srchmatch=Broad&amp;gsrc=S&amp;gclid=CM_7vc626rsCFdOWtAodIVoADg You can get a 5 year fixed rate mortgage at less than 3%: http://www.money.co.uk/mortgages/5-year-fixed-rate-mortgages.htm
So you've borrowed £95k at a rate of 3%. We'll say it's on an interest only basis to keep it simple. (You'd be better off with a repayment mortgage as the size of the loan would decrease over time). Each year you will pay £95k * 3% = £2850 on the mortgage. Over 5 years that is £14250.

To be conservative assume house prices are rising at 5% annually. http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/06/house-prices-rise-help-to-buy-halifax
After year 1 the house is worth £105k, year 2 £110250, Y3 £115763, Y4 £121551, Y5 £127628. After 5 years the house is worth over £27k more than you paid for it.

By buying after 5 years you've gained £27k in value and made £14k in mortgage payments, so you are £13k up.

Renting, you were £39k down. That's £52,000 worse off than if you had bought. You might turn down £52k but I wouldn't.

TLDR. Renting 5 years: -39% = worse off. Buying 5 years: +13% = better off. Difference 52%. Proof!

I'm all for things like this even if it means I have to pay a little extra in taxes. I've always been willing to pay a little more to live a little better. I am however against the idea of throwing money at people/things and hoping it works out. They should only try to keep the Square open if they think it has a chance at being a success. I worked at the square (mostly in the venue though) for large parts of last year and if my memory is right those buildings are no where near a point where they could be kept open permanently without having a lot of work done. I might be wrong on that though.

true,Silocon,null,null,"National identity of Scottish vs British seems a strange thing to me. The cultural differences between many groups in the UK are, in my experience, *significantly greater* than the Scottish/rUK (or Scottish/English) cultural differences. Consider the following groups north/south England, rural/urban/commuter towns, historically-British/1st generation immigrant, chav/working class/middle class, private/state educated, drinker/teetotal, gay/straight, Highlander/Glaswegian - many of the lifestyle/political/cultural differences between these groups is far greater than I've ever seen between Scots and non-Scots. 

For example, even though Scotland leans politically more to the left than England, this difference is small. By which I mean the %-variation over recent history (5 years) of how many people think uni should be free in England vs Scotland, is *greater* than the %-variation between the countries (Source: British Social Attitudes Survey 2011)

My point being that Scottish identity as a unifying force is far weaker than the other bases for cultural identity - but this unifying identity is being heavily promoted and advertised right now in order to create politically useful them-and-us conditions. Compare Britain to France and you'll see truly significant cultural and historical differences that warrant separate government (consider how the French differ in regard to agricultural practice, language-preservation, military-interventionism, state control of education, energy policy, European policy, protectionism etc.) 

Thus, I'm against independence for the same reasons I'd be against Birmingham-independence, or teetotal-independence: they're simply bad and insufficient criteria for wanting separate governments. I see Yes as more an expression of dissatisfaction with the current government which, in turn, is dissatisfaction with the economy (hence all the economic arguments being thrown about).

And if you've read this far, I must admit I'm British, then English, and many of my friends and colleagues are from Scotland.

(P.S. one thing to consider, given that all Scots that I know hate the Tories, is that the current Tory-led government is working *against* it's own electoral interests by trying to keep Scotland in the union. They're doing this on principle that we are stronger together, despite [even because of] our differences - different sides learn from each other, they don't just walk out of the debate.)

* British citizen habitually resident in Scotland on day one of independence.

true,michaelisnotginger,cnty-scotland,"Scottish-Italian, will deep fry your pizza","Right here we go:

The fundamental assumption made by a lot of campaigners is that Yes Scotland is intrinsically positive, with Better Together being intrinsically negative.  And some of the campaigning has borne out by that. But I'd argue that's not necessarily the case. Yes Scotland assumes that the current state of affairs, political, military, cultural, will continue along a linear path, with Scotland becoming hypothetically ever more separated from the rest of Britain. That's not necessarily the case. 30 years ago (or thereabouts) there were Conservative MPs in Glasgow - who knows where we'll next be in the next 30 years. Voting independence because of perceived political differences now is I think an argument that falls apart upon scrutiny. I also think that the importance of the Greens and the SSP have been far overstated by the SNP government and have been used as a fig leaf to hide economic advisers (Jim MacColl) and others that do not differ widely to their Westminister counterparts

Moreover the argument that Scotland has been able to preserve most of its systems - the NHS, no tuition fees etc - under attack from England is only partly true. Scotland has kept these *because* of the Union, not *despite* it. Scotland's free tuition fees are guaranteed in part by a British system of research council funding that proportionally benefits Scottish universities (and one I believe the Scottish government wants to remain in place), Scotland's health system remains because of the devolution promised and delivered (with the abrogation of further powers) by successive British governments. These allow Scotland, relatively sheltered from economic storms to choose according to its people. I honestly think independent, I think we would have to make choices buffetted by the slings and arrows of outrageous economic circumstance, and they would not always be to our liking. We have seen further devolution of powers and I think a federal UK is the ultimate outcome. It's something I'd like to see.

Following on from this point - and I do not consider it scaremongering - the financial sector. It employs roughly 80,000 in Glasgow and Edinburgh and is of huge value to the economy - with huge front and back end offices in both. These are highly valued skilled workers that will most likely dissipate upon independence, or at least substantially reduce. Scotland comparing its GDP and its financial sector would be in a similar situation to Cyprus last year - there's a really good piece by the Treasury over this. This is not to mention other companies that would be spooked - I can only speak anecdotally, my father runs an engineering company that works with higher education and people are very worried about the ramifications of independence. Some are making plans to move. 

Finally (because I have rambled on a lot and I could for ever) the union isn't perfect. No one ever said it is. But what it offers - history tradition, cultural similarities, freedom of movement - is so good that the independence campaign is assuring us that we'll keep the bits the public like and jettison the bits we don't. A partnership doesn't work like that. An MEP once said to me about Greece and the EU: ""Just because you hit a bump in the road, isn't a reason to abandon a major friendship"". Well there have been bumps, but the interdependence of our culture isn't just David Tennant or Fraser Forster. It's the hundreds of thousands of Scots and English that work in either country and see that we have few differences between us (though I've not found a white pudding supper yet...).

1. Sheffield vs Lancaster - Sheffield wins. There's always something happening in Sheffield, Lancaster feels dead in comparison.

2. Out of town campus (LU) vs In-city campus (UoS) - Sheffield wins. I can get anywhere within a short walk, and private accommodation can still be very convenient in terms of distance. Lancaster simply can't match this.

3. Aesthetics - Sheffield wins. Lots of very visually impressive buildings. Lancaster has none.

4. Student's union - Sheffield's is the best in the country, Lancaster doesn't have one. The colleges do not make up for this. Sheffield wins.

5. Accomodation quality/price - Lancaster's cheap accommodation costs more than Sheffield's, and is worse. Lancaster's expensive accommodation costs more than Sheffield's, and is worse. Sheffield wins.

6. Accomodation location - Sheffield has three 'villages'. City is on campus, very close to the city center. Endcliffe and Ranmoor are one mile down the road (away from the city center). Lancaster's accommodation is all on campus (except for Chancellor's Wharf).  Lancaster wins overall, but with a nod to the fact that Sheffield's City accommodation is better.

7. Societies - Both very good, which has the edge depends entirely on your personal interests. Draw.

8. Close-knit community - The colleges do foster a sort of homeliness that you don't get at Sheffield. Having 9 bars on campus is also nice, if a tad excessive. Lancaster wins.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"There seems to be this perception that Scotland is the neglected step-sister of England within the UK, but this doesn't reflect reality as many regions are neglected compared with London and the Home Counties. People are just as alienated from Westminster politics in Yorkshire and Cornwall as they are in Aberdeenshire. Problems such as loss of employment opportunities to post-Industrial decline are just as prevalent in Portsmouth as they are in Glasgow. 

The idea that you fix these problem by moving the centre of gravity from London to Edinburgh seems farcical to me because you still have the same model of a highly centralised political system, it will just be centralised somewhere else. To oversimplify these problems with nationalistic rhetoric, from either side, is an affront to the intelligence of voters. 

I would much rather Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales remain within the UK and work with us to create reforms to revitalise our regions and rebalance our economy. I think the European Union regional model is what we should be working with, the Nation State is good for many things, it provides us with a basis for influential foreign policy and a strong unified position for trade negotiations, but it is not the only option and I think we would do better to maintain a cohesive United Kingdom but to work on promoting the distinctiveness and productivity of our regions within that framework. I think having devolved areas of responsibility and making sure decisions are taken at local level where appropriate is the way forward. 

I am almost certain that the 'No' camp will win the referendum, although both campaigns have been tawdry and neither particularly deserves to win. If reddit was a barometer of National Political Opinion the Green Party and the Pirate Party would be dominating UK politics at all time, but they clearly don't. Young people often tend to forget that its the vote on the day that counts, not the internet forum debates in the weeks leading up to it. 

The polling analysis I've seen indicates a healthy majority for a 'No' vote with the bulk of 'Yes' votes being from the generation who grew up under Thatcher. 70s and early 80s babies. The older generation is more Unionist, probably as a consequence of the shared experiences of the War of *their* parents generation whilst the younger generation is also more likely to self-describe as British. I understand that the Nationalist sentiment in certain sectors is very strong and passionate, but I don't think its as widespread as the SNP makes out, I think they underestimate the number of people who're just as passionate about the Union.

Well, technically that's true - the UK is the only member state that the EU recognised, so Scotland no more received an opt-out over Schengen than England or Wales/NI did.

But in practice, travelling to any of the countries in the UK is the same process if you're coming from a Schengen country.

The Edinburgh Agreement means that the UK government are going to honour the result, and there is none of the controversy there is in Spain (where the Spanish constitution explicitly prohibits secession), so I think the EU's attitude will be a constructive one.

&gt; That said, I don't think it's that terrible that Scotland joins Schengen, because the rest of the UK and in turn the Republic of Ireland will simply join Schengen as well to maintain as much of the status quo as possible.

The British Isles are already treated as a slightly special case, and the EU plays a long game. IMO they are more likely to get Scotland, Ireland, and rUK into Schengen in the long term if they show some flexibility in the short term.

&gt; Come to think of it, I don't know why we argue about losing the opt-outs. The Euro can be blocked through a loophole and Schengen isn't a big deal. The UK-Schengen border is so ridiculously porous at may as well not be there.

I'm a joule of energy that was just produced in a computer CPU. Firstly I get transferred away from the CPU in a heatsink using (in most cases) a heat pipe which makes the use of two phase changes. Now that I'm at the edge of the heatsink a mechanical fan ""pushes"" me into passing air trapped in a little metal box. Another fan then takes this air and pushes it out of the metal box the server is in. With the thermal paste, the heat pipe, the heat sink, it's fan *and* the case fan that's five separate points of failure that will require server maintenance should they fail. Heat pipes leak (albeit rarely), some crappy paste dries out, heat sinks get clogged with dust and fans die. 

I'm now floating about in what is usually a locked room in any largish company. With lots of servers in this room I then get transferred through the AC, involving another couple of state changes and mechanical aids to make it work. And I float off into the atmosphere. The AC unit brings in at least three new points of failure through it's own coolant loop, the compressor and the fan outside and it itself is a net user of electricity. 

*Meanwhile*, in the other parts of the building where the people are, entirely different systems are used to generate heat which they go to great lengths to stop it escaping the building through various problems faced by modern architecture office buildings.

That's their *fees*, from which you need to take VAT, expenses and so on which amount to around half. So that's equivalent to a £28k per year salary. And that's the median so half of them earn less than that. You can certainly get by on £28k, but it's hardly megabucks for a professional.

What will happen (what already happens to an extent after the last changes when they introduced a flat rate for cases instead of paying by the hour) is that lawyers simply won't be able to afford to spend the time on a case that it deserves. You'll also make criminal law even less desirable than other aspects of law than it already is, so the profession will get the dregs from law schools who couldn't get into more lucrative fields like property law or litigation or whatever.

So, if you're poor and facing your life being ruined by a miscarriage of justice the person fighting your corner will be a lawyer who is there because they can't find a better job and who will spend as little time as they can on your case and might be preoccupied with how they're going to be able to afford to get their broken boiler fixed.

Sure, it would ideally be possible to transfer waste heat from servers to heat offices, but the additional cost and complexity to achieve marginal reductions in heating costs and less effective cooling of the servers just isn't worth it. I haven't run the numbers, but remember that servers are less efficient when they're hot - if you're trying to reject heat to an office at 20°C, cooling of the servers will be less effective. It's also not possible to guarantee that server load will be well correlated with heating demand, and the servers themselves probably won't be able to meet peak heating requirements in any typical office.

For a large fraction of the year, both the servers and the office will need to be cooled. If the office happens to be in a data centre, office heating probably isn't a major energy user anyway.

Don't know about Scotland, but historically they were very anti-science in England.  Their stated science policy has improved, but it's still clear there are contesting camps.

&gt;I despise the term anti-science. It is based on the assumption science is something that should be pursued at all costs, ignoring the societal effects, and comes across as a clumsy attempt to potray the other side as being somehow pro-science (whatever the hell that means).

Science and engineering and technology are fundamentally neutral, or they should be, however, only the most foolish of scientists, engineers or technologists approaches their work with a completely blank moral slate - they need to consider the possible consequences of their work, indeed it's morally bankrupt even repugnant for them not to do so.

On the other hand, the scientific method is something which should be pursued at all costs, since there's no other way we have to advance human knowledge in a reliable fashion, and without it we're throwing darts in the dark.

Edit:  If that doesn't make sense, what I'm trying to say is that whilst I will certainly not support every scientific development, every technology, and how it is ultimately used, in the name of progress (because - politics, ethics, morality, equality, freedom, etc.), I will always support the scientific method as the best means to develop and assess them until I'm convinced that a better option exists.",0,1389048118,null,0,1389048654,0,cej1hxf,t3_1ukdsc,t1_cej1hxf,t1_cej0xrm,null,1431828642,35,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,35

&gt;""Nor is it clear from this document what grounds they have for their strong assertion that an independent Scotland will somehow automatically retain the UK's opt-outs or a share of the UK rebate – we can see no legal or political basis for such an emphatic claim.

&gt;""It will be interesting to see how other [EU] member states react to the claims the Scottish government have put forward in this document.""

&gt;Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said Spain could be followed by other EU member states: ""The nationalists insisted an independent Scotland would not be put outside the European Union but this intervention from the Spanish prime minister directly contradicts this assertion.

&gt;""Hard won opt-outs on Schengen, the Euro and the rebate would be in doubt and might have to be traded away to get back in. At breakfast the SNP said there was little doubt, by teatime there was little certainty.""

I've never known a small to medium server room that had any measures to protect against intake of any of those things to be honest. 

&gt;  but the additional cost and complexity

Would it? Server rooms normally share a wall with the office part of the building so a relatively simple transfer loop is all that's needed. 

&gt; if you're trying to reject heat to an office at 20°C, cooling of the servers will be less effective. It's also not possible to guarantee that server load will be well correlated with heating demand

Of course, all of these would be taken into consideration. It would need to be a fully reversible system where different loops would be used to shunt heat to where it's needed between the three different areas. Or alternatively the server-&gt;office transfer would be independent and supplemental to the regular heating/cooling, when it's needed to heat the office the traditional AC takes up the server room slack. 

&gt; For a large fraction of the year, both the servers and the office will need to be cooled.

Indeed, but discussion about the effects needs to take place at many levels. And at the end of the day, people may not want what is on offer. Shouldn't force railways upon the natives.

&gt;On the other hand, the scientific method is something which should be pursued at all costs, since there's no other way we have to advance human knowledge in a reliable fashion, and without it we're throwing darts in the dark.

Scientific method is a process, nothing more and human knowledge shouldn't be a goal in and of itself. 

But, general stuff aside, the particular claims of anti-science are often levied at protests against nuclear plants and GM food. Neither of which are the physical manifestation of the scientific method, both of which will have long term effects on society and presuppose certain conditions which not everyone agrees with.

We could feed the world at the moment, world hunger is a distribution problem. GM can be argued to be a distraction from this that will end up working against developing countries through patent nonsense. 

Proposals for nuclear power plants are based on assumptions that city living will be desirable for the lifetime of the plant and that electricity demands will remain constant. Others would argue for more distributed living and heavily pursing energy efficiency. Radical arguments, but consistent and certainly not ""anti-science"".

true,johnmj,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"The guy quoting below is quoting me (thanks, /u/ruizscar). 

I'm curious how you've reached your conclusion. I appreciate that the case for lawyers going on strike is always going to be a hard sell. Put simply, there are a hell of a lot of wealthy lawyers around, and we've already seen from the public reaction to GPs considering industrial action that people simply don't warm to it.

However, these cuts will truly cause damage not merely to some big-wig barristers' back pockets, but to a lot of people who simply can't afford legal representation that they privately fund.

These cuts target 30% of the (already vastly over-stretched) legal aid budget. Legal aid lawyers generally do NOT make a lot of money. The vast majority go in to the area because of their genuine passion for the right of all to have legal representation, irrespective of their wealth. By hauling back on the budget, and restricting the kind of cases where legal aid is allowed (in what can only be described as an arbitrary way), they're damaging access to justice to people. 

I've left law school in £40,000 of debt in student loans, bank loans, overdrafts and a loan from my parents (and with the latter, i'm exceptionally lucky). I was most interested in human rights, another vastly underfunded area of law. But I can't afford to work in that area, I'd not be debt before I hit 45, so I'm going into commercial law. Many others will now do similar with criminal law. There's not the funding or the incentive to go into it but for the very top few barristers, who are masters of their profession and probably worked long, hard hours for not very much earlier in their career. This reduces the quality and quantity of good criminal lawyer, and their pay will be a joke.

This is why I'd rather be rich and guilty than poor and innocent. This is why the barristers have walked. They are entirely correct, in my opinion, to have done so.",0,1389049100,null,0,false,0,cej1yk1,t3_1ukhq9,t1_cej1yk1,t1_cej107o,null,1431828859,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28

As for the sword, yes he carries a sword that was actually the prop sword used in the film Excalibur.

Some of these are general tips, others more specific. I am assuming that you will talk to several teachers/dons and a housemaster and maybe the deputy head. If it is anything like my 6th form intake, most of the boys will be from abroad, although if it's mixed, that's rarely the case.

First, the interviewers are not there to trip you up. They want to find out more about you, how your mind works and how you much you've learned. They'll ask odd questions, yes, but they're to see how you think on the spot.

It's easy enough to say don't be nervous, but of course you will be, what I can say is don't worry too much. They expect this and so the usual format is to start of with some simple questions to ease you in. I repeat, they're not there to trip you up.

As a general rule, it's good to demonstrate knowledge without being asked, especially if you can link it in to the question. So brush up on Maupassant, Voltaire, Shelley or whoever you have been reading in and out of your classes. The more outside the curriculum the better.

The Housemaster will ask about what you do outside the classroom and they want to see that you're self-motivated, especially if this is a boarding school, so try to have a mixture of sports and clubs/societies to talk about. If you don't do sports, then don't bullshit about it, but my advice would be to say you do 5 aside football or something sociable like that, as they know it's a great way to bond with boys who have already made strong friendships. They don't for your sake or theirs want someone who will just be alone in their bedsit for 2 years.

Whatever happens though, stay positive, because if you have made it to the interview stage, they've seen something in you which they like, so congratulations on making it this far. If you get in, don't be scared of the boys/girls; ""posh"" people aren't a different race.

German forces are very restricted by their government to peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts which massively inhibits their ability to protect themseles in Marzar-e-sharif. Their politicians are terrified of all conflict and they have very strict anti-military regulations written in to their law. This not only makes their situation more dangerous because their rules of engagement aren't appropriate for a warzone where they are the primary enemy, but it makes their other tasks more difficult too. 

 They were tasked to train the Afghan National Police (UK got Narcotics, Italy got Justice, etc) but Germany didn't exactly do very well, both in terms of quality and quantity of policemen produced. The Americans had to step in to help with the issue of quantity, but still haven't solved the issue of quality and now we have a lot of Afghan National Police, but they all face massive issues of corruption, treachery and rampant criminal activity. Given that the police are more of a requirement in Afghanistan (local security is what's needed to convince villagers to invest in government rather than the Taliban), its a serious issue for us.

Well, they have formed the last two Scottish governments. I think their biggest weakness is that they have actually done a pretty good job of things - and so run the risk of winning elections due to being competent, but not necessarily winning a referendum.

&gt; 2) Don't think that Scotland will necessarily become a left wing paradise. A centre right party will come to prominence

That sounds like a step forward. A monoculture, left or right, is never healthy. I think there are differences between Scotland and England (or Scotland and the Home Counties) in terms of how people think society should be, but there may well be people who think differently.

One advantage of independence is that elections would continue to be run on a proportional-ish voting system (AMS), and as such you'd expect the power awarded to governments to be more commensurate with their share of the vote (vs FPTP).

&gt; 3) Also I find the whole oil money thing to be foolish. The EUs own internal estimate/plan is that it will be on 90% renewables by 2050

Scotland will, like Denmark, probably exhaust its oil by 2050. So the question is really what the best use of that revenue is while it is still available.

&gt; But it's your decision. I just find many of the posters in r/Scotland to be hilariously deluded, they probably blame England for why Scotland doesn't have hover-cars or moon colonies.

If my government makes British companies design and build the best wind turbines/solar panels etc in the world then other countries are going to come to us for power generation, which will make us money in the long term. Giving contracts to British companies only means that, although my government may spend more in the short run, in the long rub the country would end up far better off for it. Nationalise the companies which essentially hold monopolies anyway (ie water, trains etc) and provide a government company for power, to ensure that prices stay reasonable, though make private companies possible (like Bupa and the NHS maybe?)Make the benefits system work well, and act as a great safety net for society, not just an 'ok' one. Ensure that council houses exist, try and make sure that hope exists among people who live in them - maybe we could invest more heavily in space, work with Europe to put man on the moon. With hope for the future, as you get with space travel, younger generations thrive. Make sure there is less red tape in government, get rid of middle management except in places where they are really needed. Make sure we stay united as a country (perhaps we could infiltrate and overthrow the Tories? Alex doesn't even need to argue, he's got the head of the Yes campaign demonstrating how excellent independence would be already) After a decade and with significant investment, you have a fantastic foundation for small businesses, so British creativity can rule the world again as it has done before. You can tax electricity to recover lost income from decreased fossil fuel usage, using the profits to further invest and make the system even more efficient. Younger generations aspire to be like their hero John Smith, the first British man on the moon. Britain has a truly world class transport system, her people are once again leading the world into the future through their creativity, the pound is once again the dominant world currency and we are the beacon of hope in an otherwise dim reality.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"There are a couple things about Shane Long that i think have resulted in him being linked to us.  

First, his contract is up in the summer meaning he would be cheap. His wages are very low as well. 

Second, he would be moving up to a bigger team (read more money and more success) and would be brought in specifically to be the 3rd/4th striker and he is a hard working, head down and work type of player means you shouldn't hear bitching from him about playing time. He has PL experience for a team that has nowhere close to as much talent as us so he knows what to expect in league and may get better service.

Third, he's a bit different type of striker than we currently have on the squad. He's bigger than JD and about the same height than Soldado. He has decent pace and isn't bad at holding up the ball. More importantly....he's one of those constant running strikers that is constantly darting between defenders and pressuring the ball deep. Simply put...he's an annoying shit to defenders which does have a place in the world.

Long while not exciting is one of those moves that is almost no harm to the team if you make the move especially since he would be cheap. Not a sexy signing, not a guy that the fans are salivating over, not a guy who sells shirts, not a guy who you will ever expect to bang in 20...just a hard working guy who knows his place and can do enough of everything well enough to be a burst of energy and usefulness off the bench.  

Don't know that i would really want Long, but i actually wouldn't be overly upset if we landed him either.

Would prefer we chased a striker who in terms of development was a bit more advanced than Kane but still in that 18-21 age bracket that you can develop and just let him pair with Kane as the 3rd/4th striker. 

That said, i am actually not expecting us to sign anyone.  If we do i would almost expect a loan of a veteran unless a great deal fell in our lap.

true,the_jacksown,cnty-uk,"Nottingham ","Here's the thing about cutting the debt: macroeconomics and microeconomics are different for a reason. This might seem supremely obvious and yet so many people fail to apply this fact to the current economic recovery. Obviously it's not smart to run your household at a deficit. That wouldn't work.

Countries are different though, and virtually every country is a debtor to some other country (and a creditor to other countries too). Debt makes the world go round, really. What actually matters is the percentage of debt to GDP; the raw figure isn't a meaningful metric for the economic success of a country. The UK's debt to GDP ratio is, granted, fairly high with estimates putting it at around 88% for 2012 (the most recent year I could find, [source](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2186rank.html)).


Politicians, however, don't mind bringing up this huge number of how much raw debt the UK has because scares people. You think to yourself ""I wouldn't want to be in debt for £1.2 million, so my country certainly shouldn't be in debt for £1.2 trillion,"" or something along those lines, but this logic is fundamentally flawed. The principles are, as I pointed out above, very different. 

Now, having said all of that, trimming the budget isn't necessarily a bad thing. Governmental efficiency is a good thing and the last thing we need now is more economic wastefulness. However, the political reality is that nobody wants to see their discretionary funding cut. The unemployed want their JSA, the sick (and pretty much everybody) wants to save the NHS, and lawyers want legal aid sustained, etc. 

So how would I cut the UK's debt? I probably wouldn't. What I would do instead is continue QE to promote a positive shift in consumption, deregulate the business sector (carefully and modestly) and lower the corporate tax rate to attract businesses to the UK, and generally try to revitalise the economy by promoting the flow of credit. The more money people have the more money they are going to spend, and that money will be the salary of someone else, who will then go out and spend it. This perpetuates more demand (aggregate demand) for goods and services. Then when supply can no longer keep up companies find they need to hire more workers and increase their production to meet demand. And thus, a job is born. On a larger scale, this will increase the GDP of the UK and, ceteris paribus, lower the GDP to debt ratio without slashing the budget.

So yeah, I realise I've gone on somewhat of a Keynesian rant there but that's what I would do instead of slashing departmental budgets in an effort to reduce the raw debt of the UK.

On the first point, although it is hard to doubt the quality of both Gerrard and Lucas, I think the first half of the season provided ample evidence that the partnership is susceptible being overrun and is not the most mobile.  Gerrard's set piece's are incredible, but the pressing game and the energy of the midfield drops off with he and Lucas.

As for Dawson, I honestly think he's a better captain than player.  Really solid lad who is intelligent and embodies team spirit really well.  You can see the other players really respect him, and he's good at organising the defence.

However, I don't think he's world class and lacks the pace to keep up with the best forwards.  He seems like a great guy to have around, but if we really want to challenge for top four consistently year after year, I don't see him as one of our starting players.",0,1389054996,null,0,false,0,cej4lqg,t3_1ujb4x,t1_cej4lqg,t1_ceiwt2f,null,1431830188,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I don't have any experience in how well it will dry, but just to be sure, I sprayed it with the spray you can buy at shoe shops to make your shoes more resistant to water. I think that will work out alright. 

Ok, flap in detail: 

Fabric: blue rectangle + seam allowance, same thing in black. Black strip + seam allowance, Some white fabric for underneath window frames and letters. 

I printed out the window pattern on paper, pinned the templates onto the fabric, and cut with a box cutter (using a ruler of course, and all on a wood panel to not cut into my floor) along the edges. Then I pinned some white fabric underneath it and used a very narrow zig zag stitch to go around each window.
Put that aside and start on the black bar. You'll need some seam allowance for that one.
Again, I printed the letters and cut them out (this time partially with scissors). then I glued the black fabric on some white fabric with fabric glue (which worked surprisingly well). 
The edges of the letters are fixated with clear nail polish, just to make sure they don't fizz up.
The black strip goes on top of the blue flap. Just fold down the seam allowance and sew it on. 
Next, sew the black and blue fabric together, let the two uncoated sides you want to be outside face each other and sew around the edge, leaving the back open. Turn the whole thing inside out, done. :-D

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt;Ok Germany did not advocate conflict? Ummmm, yes they did.

No. No meaningful German wanted a European War, and no evidence suggests it.

&gt;Look into Germany's massive and insane military culture where people like Admiral Tirpitz was promoted to head of the navy. Look into them systematically building up their army, setting off a naval race and having some very detailed plans for the invasion of France which relied on striking first and invading Belgium in the process. Look at their actions on the international stage, escalating tensions in Morocco in the various Morocco crises. Look at them explicitly giving Austro-Hungary a carte-blanche to invade Serbia and Russia, and then repeatedly refusing British offers to mediate the issues peacefully. 

None of this is advocating war; all of it was very common in European politics at the time. Yes they had a military culture, but so did Britain, they certainly exalted the military and proclaimed it's importance with jingoism and nationalism, but that's not the same as specifically advocating a European war against Russia, France and Britain - which they got. The rise of Realpolitik was representative of a new German assertiveness and an attempt to compete with the traditional imperial powers (they gained their first colonies etc.). The Moroccan crises' was exactly that, a crisis in which the Germans lost out and lost face (caused by the idiocy’s of the Kaiser) , but it was exactly in order with their attempt to challenge French and British domination, it was a warning shot across the bow that they were important world players. If they had actually wanted to start a war this would be **the worse** kind of pretext for any invasion. The Schlieffen Plan was a plan in case war arrived, all European countries have them, Britain has a plan if Argentina invades the Falklands, it isn't the same as advocating a conflict, not to mention it had been written 50 years previously. They did give A-H a blank check, but not to invade Russia, this was all part of the power politics of international diplomacy and negotiation; it was an attempt to force the other nations hand and strengthen their own. Of course Germany wouldn't accept mediation from Britain, it was jingoistic, it obviously wouldn't accept the jurisdiction of any other power, especially its rival...Germany acted the same as all powerful states in history (the USA doesn’t recognise the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court for example), and totally in line with their imperial ambitions. 

However the statement you're making hasn't been made by any historian ever, there's no evidence Germany planned for or advocated conflict, there's not even a consensus on whether Germany caused WW1, led alone premeditated it. Wilhelm tried to stop German mobilisation after all. WW1 was caused by aggressive diplomacy which required each side to rack up the tension, when none caved it led into a war which none had designed. There's no evidence to suggest the July Crisis was an attempt by Germany to start a European war, in fact there actions were extremely parochial and localised, of course they were aggressive and self-aggrandizing like the militarist imperial nation they were. In fact **all** evidence suggest they wanted Britain to be neutral. Relations between them and Britain had actually been increasing after they signed a deal over the Bagdad Railway and the partition of the Portuguese colonies.

&gt;If you read the article you yourself posted you can see that the academic himself agrees that ""The war was fought for defensive reasons.""

Well I don't agree with everything in the article, but I agree with this. Britain certainly did fight to defend, they fought to defend their colonies, their imperial power and hegemony, and there prestige. And it won and got most of Germany's colonies. However as AJP Taylor noted, all European nations were convinced that in modern warfare, attack was better than defence (they were of course wrong).",0,1389056317,null,0,false,0,cej57ak,t3_1udfx4,t1_cej57ak,t1_cehsme4,null,1431830495,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt; Care to share any examples of a country that Britain had a treaty guaranteeing a country's neutrality and sovereignty but failed to uphold the treaty?

you completely missed my point. Either Britain only defeated countries it had a treaty with, or it defended countries for moral and ethical reasons - **it cannot be both**. Morality and ethnics cannot logically be particular, they have to be universal, if you believe you should defend people it's then immoral to place a pre-fix which state you have to have had an agreement before you defend them. 

&gt;You don't seem to understand the concept of neutrality and the treaty that guaranteed it. 

again, this is a strawman, if you read what I wrote it was in response to your statement that Britain’s intervention was a moral and ethical choice, but it wasn't, it was, as you reversely noted, because they had a treaty with Belgium, and hence it was nothing to do with ethics or morality, it was due to treaty signatures and allies etc.

as for my point about it being a red herring, neutrality in this case doesn't mean neutrality as we often understand it. Belgium was, as you noted, a close friend and ally of Britain, they were protected by Britain. But as you also note many other countries agreed to the same agreement, though some evidently with more intention than others, it evidently wasn't some sacred document to those other countries...the reasons for Britain signing it were very different to other signatories.

true,northerncal,lfc68,,"""of course it does""? Do you have any proof for that? It is really not that simple and to assume Brendan Rodgers and agger/sakho, and all the other managers who play opposite footed CBs are too dumb to realize that it's not an issue seems pretty silly to me. 

Besides not being able to pass as well, (CBs most typically pass out towards the flank, so being left footed on the right side means it is easier for opponents to block your passes) there are actually other problems. It does make defending and tackling more challenging, almost everyone is better at tackling with their strong foot wrong side means you have to try to stop everyone who is cutting in at you from wide with your weak side. There are lots of smaller issues as well, like the fact that people naturally, and more comfortably turn around or run backwards towards their dominant side, so this means that it is going to be more challenging and less natural for wrong sided defenders to deal with balls over the top or tracking back towards goal while being run at by an attacker on the ball. 

It's not a life threatening deal, but it is a real issue, and there's a reason sakho and agger are the only combo not tried together and it isn't just Rodgers being dense. ",0,1389056985,null,0,false,0,cej5ii9,t3_1ukse9,t1_cej5ii9,t1_cej3doq,null,1431830631,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

On the other hand, playing at home against weaker sides we would have an attacking line up, with less worry about defense. I'm going to pick aggressive, because it's more interesting. 

All - attack XI: 

4-3-3:

                         Sturridge 


Formatting got kinda messed up cause I'm on mobile, but essentially Lucas - Gerrard - Coutinho is a standard triangle with cou at the peak, and sterling plays wide on the right, slightly closer to our own goal than Suarez, who is on the opposite flank but slightly further forward and more central, with sturridge as the center forward up top.

Personally I think in less than 5 years Courtois will be on par with Neuer if not better and will eventually become the best goalkeeper in the world(possibly the world has ever seen)

Cech is an incredible keeper and is a club legend but his head injury shortens his career coupled with the fact he wants to retire early rules him out even further. 

Courtois is very public about what he wants and as far as I can tell there will be a sit down with him, his dad, his agent and Mourinho before the end of the season, possibly January although with Copa Del Rey it might have to wait, and they will talk about whats going on next season.

Personally I think we should use cech for cup matches with courtois for prem and if he is in bad form we can always use cech, similar to lopez and casillas.

I think once Cech has been faded out, he should move to a team in the BPL and retire maybe 1-2 years after being with that team. He's better than most goalkeepers in the BPL, and I think for him to get first team at another club before retirement would be beneficial to not only Cech but to that club and football in general.

They just don't *get* propaganda. 

Take the latest mess of central messages- where the Tories are focusing on rewarding ""hardworking people"" and ""strivers"" (as their target electorate believe themselves to be), and Labour hit the nail on the head with a ""cost of living crisis"" and policies targeted squarely at things mattering to people on the receiving end of some of the Coalition's nastier policies, what do the Lib Dems do? 

They find a way to insert that *fucking* slogan into *every single paragraph of every single speech, pamphlet, press release, focus and newsletter they put out*.

&gt;The Liberal Democrats are committed to building a Stronger Economy in a Fairer Society enabling everyone to get on in life. 

It's a work of genius. I doubt it'd be possible to come up with a more insipid bit of rhetoric if you were to set out with the intent of doing just that. 

The ever-on message campaigning drones continue to parrot it out in the seeming belief that, somehow, if they repeat it often enough, it'll reach a sort of saturation point in the public's collective consciousness, and support'll start rolling back in.

John Guidetti age: 21 ST (Man City) Loan

Lewis Holtby age:23 CAM (Spurs) Loan

My preferences would be Defour and Holtby (I'd rather buy Holtby. He has no future at Spurs anyway).  But I'd take Hoolahan or Jones if need be.  Whatever the combination we need an attacking midfielder and a defensive midfielder.  I'd also like some cover for CB and perhaps ST, but loans would be fine there since we'll have Okore and Kozak back next year.

Fuck what the majority wants, think of it this way. My rights end where your rights begin.

Parents and kids have a right to set certain standards for the environment when it comes to education. 

Me committing sex acts in the street. Is this different from just being nude? Absolutely. We already make acknowledgements in the law that adding a sexual element to something changes the way we handle it. Look at rape versus certain serious assaults. A man can rape a drunk sleeping woman and will (and rightfully so) get a pretty harsh jail sentence, comparable to an assault which would have cause more physical pain.

My walking around nude on the street however, that harms no one. It's not an inherently sexual act, it's not a disease carrying act, it's not in a close place like a subway or on private property where it would be reasonable to ask me not to. If I'm walking around naked in the open and I'm not touching or harassing anyone then really, that's not causing any direct harm to anyone and so it's not a case of whether people like me doing it or not.

Don't get your hopes up too much guys, remember the Willian fiasco last window. A deal is only done once you read about it on the LFC website, even SSN got it wrong a few times.

* potential poor workmanship with the concrete casing, leading to groundwater contamination.

* storage of fracking fluids in open air vinyl ponds, and how to ensure that all of this material is properly (and expensively) remediated, rather than 'lost' through leaks, or mysteriously dumped into some local woodland.

These things can be substantially prevented using good regulation, but the regulation, for instance as recommended by the RAE, is unfortunately not in place.",0,1389069153,null,0,false,0,cejbe2p,t3_1ukdsc,t1_cejbe2p,t1_cej729s,null,1431833424,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

&gt;but he's got a track record with our players

Are you referring to the McEachran loan? Sigurdsson was better and Josh wasn't ready for the Premier League. What was Rodgers supposed to do, play Josh over Sigurdsson because of his Chelsea connections? He'd have been crucified by the fans and the board had he made a choice like that.

&gt; Based on his performances last season (and at Wigan)

Yes, but based on this season, he's been pretty crap. We've seen it a million times, some players can't play some systems. Moses doesn't fit in there. Again what is Rodgers supposed to do, try to force a square peg into a round hole for 6 months, when they only have him on loan for a year?

If Moses had hit the ground running he'd playing, but he's struggled to adapt and at some point it's just worth it to cut their losses. The only other option for them would be to invest the time into getting Moses to fit their team, but then, if he did preform, there's a good chance we'd jack the price up on them when transfer time comes, because we know how much time they've invested in him.

Think about if we had gotten Torres on loan instead of buying him. Do you think when played like shit for the first 6 months we all would have stuck by him? No, we would have been begging Liverpool to take him back ASAP. 

^^I ^^still ^^love ^^you ^^Torres. 

&gt;it's Rodger's job to get that out of him

Hahahaha, no it isn't. The loan system isn't there for other clubs to be our training ground. There needs to be mutual benefit, especially when they are paying his wages (at least part of them). They owe us no obligation to play our player, especially if he's no preforming up to their standards. The loan system is based on the idea that we have a player who is not good enough for our team, so we find a team where he can quickly add value. Our player gets playing time and their team gets a boost in quality. It makes no sense for a club to take a bad player because they don't get the benefit of being able to sell him on. Once they've taken our player it is up to him, just like any other player in the team, to fight for a spot.

However, if we wanted more money to be coming into the economy than is currently coming in, we should be going after high-profit corporations operating in the UK who currently pay less tax than they should. 

That could be achieved either by (paradoxically) spending more on the Inland Revenue so they can hire more case workers to chase more tax, or tightening regulation on things like tax havens (where on paper the company operates out of the Principality of Monaco but in fact operates out of the UK).

This isn't a balanced team though, Suarez will play the 'in-the-hole' role more as a second striker rather than an attacking midfielder. That means he probably wouldn't track the opposition DM when he should. Why should he? Because Gerrard and Lucas can be exposed easily. We've see it all season.

Also, Phil's workrate isn't the best which is why you can't have him as your central playmaker.

Yes, but not because he was behind Sigurdsson. Josh indicated that beyond on the pitch matters, Rodgers did very little to further his development. Maybe that's not enough information to judge, but combined with what's going on with Moses I'm inclined to be suspicious.

&gt; Again what is Rodgers supposed to do, try to force a square peg into a round hole for 6 months, when they only have him on loan for a year?

I agree that a player not immediately performing well on loan can be difficult (for both the player and his manager), but given the quality of his competition, injuries, suspensions, etc., I believe that Moses could have easily gotten more than 8 starts so far. 

&gt; They owe us no obligation to play our player, especially if he's no preforming up to their standards.

I wasn't trying to say that Liverpool have some sort  of contractual obligation to play Moses (which is possible, but not at all what I was getting at and difficult to determine).

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; I agree, but my point is not that Scottish identity doesn't exist, as it obviously does, but that it's far less of a difference between people than is often assumed. Hence my point about other differences between groups, some of which are important and some less so. Then my later point was that only really big and wide-ranging differences really warrant separate governments.

Cultural differences are very much a spectrum rather than a black and white division. Frankie Boyle and Pam Ayres do share some cultural overlap, but then again they are also quite distinct. At some point their obvious differences in style and content turn into ""identity"".

Political differences can be much more clearly delineated. By the time you have a separate legal system, separate educational systems, separate policing bodies, separate environmental agencies, separate voting systems, separate birth/marriage/death records, etc then I think you are well on your way to separate governments. Some of these changes have occurred since devolution, however many of these bodies (education, healthcare, GRO, etc) have been distinct entities since their origin.

The 1991 census used the same question ([page 8](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ethnicity/focus-on-ethnicity-and-identity/a-guide-to-comparing-1991-and-2001-census-ethnic-group-data/comparing-1991-and-2001-census-ethnic-group-data.pdf)) in all four countries in the UK - essentially ethnicity rather than nationality (simply White/Black/Indian/etc).

The 2001 census used White British/Irish in England/Wales and White Scottish/British/Irish in Scotland (and similar minority ethnicities: the exact choices are on pages 10/11 of the previous link). The 2001 [results for Scotland](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/02/18876/32939) were 88% White Scottish and 7% White British, which is pretty much in line with country of birth (97% of White Scottish being born in Scotland, 6% of White British being born in Scotland).

The British Social Attitudes survey only really starts tracking this since devolution. [Their results](http://www.bsa-30.natcen.ac.uk/read-the-report/devolution/trends-in-national-identity.aspx) are that approximately 70% of people in Scotland identify as Scottish when asked to choose a single identity.

They also asked about multiple identities, and people are clearly comfortable holding two: roughly 25% ""Scottish not British"", roughly 35% ""more Scottish than British"", roughly 30% ""equally Scottish and British"", about 10% ""more British/exclusively British"". That is as much about context as anything else IMO: if asked to queue at passport control I'll look for ""British Citizens"", if asked by a foreigner if I'm British then I'll probably say Scottish, if asked by a foreigner if I'm English then I'll say no.

This is not the sort of argument that has a conclusive result however - they are different questions, at different times, and the boundary between nationality and residency and ethnicity is always going to be a bit fuzzy.",0,1389072286,null,0,false,0,cejct7b,t3_1ujzjg,t1_cejct7b,t1_cej3oo8,null,1431834094,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; As manager, Rodgers has a responsibility to get the most out of the players at his disposal; IMO by leaving Moses out so often, he is not doing that

He also has an obligation to his players and the fans to field the best team possible. If that isn't Moses, there isn't much he can do.

The best revenge was probably the reverse fixture against United at Old Trafford in May of 2013. 

After the abortion of a game that was played in October 2012 where we were down to 9 men by the 65th minute, and had clawed back to an even 2-2 we lost 3-2. Clattenburg did a shit job of refereeing and everyone knew it.

Fast forward to a near capacity crowd at Old Trafford, May 5th 2013.

0-0 until deep in the second half and [Juan Mata puts us ahead in the 87th minute](http://youtu.be/mmk4Z0MyXy4).

Definitely the best revenge we had all season. United shit in our house, and then we shit in theirs.

Martha's credibility was undercut by her infatuation with the Doctor, which is a shame.  I think they could have done more with her character, she certainly deserved it.

First year Amy was likable and made somewhat of an interesting foil for the Doctor, but I found she lost her appeal as the series progressed.  By the time ATM happened I was kind of looking forward to a new companion.

I don't think Clara has had enough character development yet to decide how she fares.  With the exception of the last couple of episodes, she has been a plot point more than anything else.  I think Jenna has portrayed the right mix of bubbly personality, quick wit and backbone to make for an interesting companion, I'm really looking forward to seeing how they write her with twelve.  I'm reserving judgement until then.

I didn't really like Rose the first time around, having grown up on the classic series I didn't really like the her portrayal as a companion.  Revisiting some of those earlier episodes I've grown more of an appreciation for how she developed and her relationship with the Doctor.  She's probably my favorite primary companion.

Rory, though, highly underrated.  I didn't like him initially when he just seemed to be a tag along, sort of how Mickey was, but he really became an interesting character as he progressed, more so than Amy in my opinion.  I kind of missed him after ATM.

I would add Sally Sparrow and Lady Christina as wild cards, although Sally Sparrow is a stretch as a companion.  They seemed like interesting, independent characters that had a lot of development done for one-off characters - would have been interesting to see where they could have gone as formal companions.

In parallel earth memes they are easily identifiable as meaning that the world is not quite the same - they were thought to be the future of air travel, some people still believe so - what would have happened if the Hindenberg never crashed - etc.  Ditto cybermen.  You could argue that Star Trek stole the Cybermen from the original series for the Borg, but I don't think anyone really feels it was a direct copy.

The lines of dialogue you're referring to are generic as well.  Studios tend to be diligent about preventing infringement claims in their productions and often have lawyers that vet the scripts, and they're not going to want to run up against BBC's Worldwide licensing group for ""stealing"" IP.  I don't think there is anything there.

I grew up on Doctor Who, and I've seen elements of it in everything from the Star Trek to the X-Files to Sliders, and even Doctor Who re-used some existing sci-fi archetypes throughout the classic series.

Last thing to remember is that writers for sci-fi shows are often fans of other shows, so it shouldn't be a surprise to see them borrowing inspiration here and there.

I watched Fringe casually, and never really saw anything that would make me think they were blatantly ripping off Doctor Who, but then I never really watched it in depth.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Stability? Genuine question: have you watched us play this season? The last game I saw was our ""victory"" at Sunderland. I was in the home stands and the SAFC supporters said they'd never seen such a shit team turn up to the SOL and park the bus. By their own admission, every other team that came to the SOL saw Sunderland as a team for the taking. Not Villa. We were ultra defensive. We were incredibly lucky to get the win (as we have been in many of our other wins this season). Let's make no bones about it: we are in a relegation fight.

I have a lot of time for the project Lambert is undertaking. I can forgive the lack of quality of the players he has signed because (with the exception of Benteke and Kozak) he has spent peanuts in the market. Some of the signings have been good and some have been bad.

What I cannot get my head around is how the 8 players behind Benteke, Weimann and Agbonlahor have forgotten how to pass a ball. Our possession statistics are not alarming they are defcon 5! It isn't because we don't have ball retainers because we do. Westwood and El Ahmadi in particular are fine passers of the ball and Delph never looks troubled under pressure with the ball.

What is it then? I think the problem comes to tactics. Lambert has been consumed with making us tigher at the back that he basically plants eight bodies behind the ball at any time. The crude idea is that as soon as we win possession, belt it up to the big lad. More often than not, we are clinical enough to score but this isn't football.

People keep crying out for a number ten but no one asks to recall Stephen Ireland who, let's be honest, is probably the best number 10 Villa could hope to attract. He played under Lambert under this system and whilst he tried very hard, he had no hope of making an impact when he saw so little of the ball.

So the TL/DR is that I'd rather go down by playing the ball and giving teams a real go than stay up and play this ultra-defensive, supreme counter attacking shit that we have had to endure.",0,1389079807,null,0,false,0,cejfa6z,t3_1ulsnu,t1_cejfa6z,t3_1ulsnu,null,1431835283,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2

Kostas Mitroglu is a good look, but a little risky as he hasn't ever played in a top league. I like him the most of all mentioned.

Diego Costa has no reason to leave. He is at what has become one of the better clubs in the world (better than Liverpool IMHO) and is playing very very well. He has stated numerous times he is very happy and has no interest in leaving. Sure, a lucrative enough offer could sway him, but there is a lot of interest from other clubs with more financial power than us.

Yilmaz is a 28, and although he is a pretty clinical finisher, he can't really create for himself at all. He relies on great creativity like Inan and Sneijder behind him and would in no way be a replacement for Luis in his style of play or quality. Plus most Gala fans will tell you that he doesn't have a good attitude and is a bit lazy.

Overall, there is no one who can replace Luis in quality or who is a good value for their price. We should replace him with a young up and coming or a less well known talent and invest in multiple positions to make up for what we lost.

https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection/if-your-landlord-doesnt-protect-your-deposit

If you do find they haven't secured the deposit, then you have a lot of leverage to get what you need. The threat of having to pay 4 times the deposit back to you as compensation is quite a strong one!

The laws protecting tenants are quite strong. Read up on them before you get tricked again.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; The thing is though, I agree with the reasons for the Scottish wanting independents but rather than break up the UK, I'd prefer we reform it and devolved all countries in the UK. What would be the Scottish opinion on this?

This is essentially devo-max (devolve everything but foreign and defence policy). The SNP suggested that this question also be asked however none of the three main Westminster parties were prepared to support it. As such, the question is simply yes or no.

Although further devolution might sound plausible, unfortunately there has been a long history of unfulfilled promises in this area. The Conservative's pitch in the 1979 referendum was that while it was [right in principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Perth) it was flawed in practice and voters should vote no - in return they promised ""something better"". Unfortunately the subsequent three Conservative governments took no steps whatsoever towards devolution.

There have also been significant reports such as the Steel Commission (LibDem) or the Calman Commission (Labour), yet neither of those parties have been willing to make a firm commitment on any specifics. I believe the Conservative's latest position is that they are ""very open"" to the idea, but will not say more than that (given that [their response](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24327938) to the Silk Commission regarding further Welsh devolution was simply to say that they were ""attracted"" to the idea, and that the Lib Dems are accusing them of stalling, you might also be skeptical about what ""very open"" means).

I don't think the meaning of ""British"" would really change that much. If you think of it as synonymous with ""the UK"" then continue to do so: the UK will still be around. If you think of it more like ""Scandinavian"" then I think it will still hold - the countries on the Scandinavian peninsula all share that word, as would countries on Great Britain.",0,1389083171,null,0,false,0,cejg2ed,t3_1ujzjg,t1_cejg2ed,t1_cej5fhr,null,1435536118,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

There's a long and detailed pro-union post from a Conservative voter currently [sitting at +15](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1ujr8x/convince_me_to_vote_no/ceiwt88), and here's an extremely pro-independence poster [sitting at -6](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1ujr8x/convince_me_to_vote_no/ceiszea).

Some posters will see both sides of it - /u/AliAskari frequently [gets upvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1uh7jl/convince_me_to_vote_yes/ceims81) (+7) when s/he posts something sensible, [and downvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1ug877/david_cameron_has_come_under_renewed_pressure_for/cehylz3) (-10) when he doesn't.

However it may well depend on [where and when](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories_citizen#Residence_in_the_United_Kingdom) you acquired BOTC status.

It looks like, prior to 2002, citizenship was only automatic for residents of the Falklands/Gibraltar.

I'm not sure if ILR grants you the same freedom of movement as all EU citizens, or if it's only valid for settlement within the UK?

Similarly, if Bermuda decides to become independent then the UK will remove both citizenship and BOTC status from some Bermudians.

It is the sixth planet discovered in the Gliese 581 planetary system and the fourth in order of increasing distance from the star. The discovery was announced by the Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey in late September 2010, after a decade of observation. However, the ESO/HARPS survey team claims that the planet does not exist.

So in comes Rose, who for all intents and purposes isn't around for long before he regenerates, so we haven't been able to see Eccleston himself get too silly. But we see a bit of a development in that sense in The Doctor Dances. He starts traveling with companions again, and rediscovers a sort of whimsy and innocence that he hasn't had around in a while. So he adapts to that.

But what he did in the Time War still weighs on his mind, so he pushes into that whimsical, magical adventure even harder, and becomes more childlike the more he tries to repress what he'd done and ignore the memory. Although I don't like Matt Smith as much as Tennant, he did an amazing job portraying that.

Now that his Time War angst has been resolved, he can keep the changes he's experienced from reuniting with companions, but the lifted guilt lets him ""grow up"" as well. Capaldi isn't a product of the same thing as Eccleston was, so I don't imagine Twelve will be too similar to Nine, but I think he will be a more serious Doctor with some Nine and a few Classic Doctors mixed in. But what we certainly won't lose is the whimsy, because I believe that's a very important part of the development of the New Series.",0,1389088703,null,0,false,0,cejh15e,t3_1ul5z1,t1_cejh15e,t1_cejcoqh,null,1431836083,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6
