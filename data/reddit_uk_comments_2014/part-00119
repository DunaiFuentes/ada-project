true,dyomas,null,null,"&gt;I don't personally count housed gypsies as gypsies.

It's because they're not. Well, sort of. It's a pretty messed up situation.

Gypsy isn't a legitimate culture, it's a lifestyle. Language changes and the term Gypsy describes various ethnic groups.

There are Irish Travelers (Gypsies of Irish descent), Romani people (Gypsies of ancient Indian [Dalit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit) caste ie. Untouchable descent), who originally named themselves after Egyptians ie. *E*Gyp*t*sies before it became a pejorative. They spread the rumor that they were descendants of people who harboured the baby Jesus, to gain more favourable reputations. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsy_(term)#Gypsy_and_Gipsy

Then once their actions and the prejudice of society caught up with them the term ""Gypsy"" became a pejorative and they decided to adopt the identity of ""Romani"" after the Romans for the better reputation (ie. based on the famed greatness of Rome). So basically another change of identity for the same reason. 

It goes in cycles. The actual ethnic group of these specific ""Gypsy"" people does not have a proper name. The closest to their actual origin for the ""Romani"" people is the Byzantine Greek term ""Tsiganoi"" and its derivatives, which literally mean ""untouchable"". However, it's very pejorative in some languages. But it's still the term for ""Romani/Gypsies"" in others.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/9719058/European-Roma-descended-from-Indian-untouchables-genetic-study-shows.html

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsy_(term)#List_of_names   

It's pretty messed up, but there isn't presently a distinguishment between various European nomads and their actual cultures vs the traveler lifestyle which is inherently antisocial because it continuously encourages poverty and criminality since the need for small scale skilled traveling craftsmen evaporated with the beginnings of the industrial revolution. The whole economic niche and purpose of gypsies just isn't compatible with modern society.

I think there needs to be a change in language and recognition of who these people actually are, and what their actual culture is vs their lifestyle before real progress can take place. ""Romani"" is inaccurate, so is ""Gypsy"". And it isn't exactly PC to call people ""Untouchables"" but the actual present day Indian [Dalits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit) are taking back the term and making tons of social progress, so maybe that's what European Dalits should do too because *that is what they are* and they have nothing whatsoever ethnically in common with Irish Travelers other than nomadic antisocial lifestyles *which only some, well most, of them follow*. 

European/Western Dalits who own houses and contribute to society should be free to call themselves something without being marginalized and associated with a systematically criminal underclass. Especially not the ones they aren't even ethnically related to like the fucking Irish. It's almost like if the only word for both Italian criminals and all black people was the word ""gangster"" ie. the equivalent of ""Gypsy"" for all ""Romani/Dalits"" and ""Irish Travelers"". That's how inherently racially and socially messed up this semantic situation is.

Society needs to stop being so static in its political correctness, so that there might be a chance to actually assess the situation and come up with some real humanitarian solutions and accurate terms for the people involved. Because right now it's like everybody's just too ignorant and/or ironically unwilling to get their hands dirty by touching this issue beyond the superficial.

So I guess my point is that Romani is a shit term and so is Gypsy, and anyway not all Gypsies are Romani and not all Romani are Gypsies. And fuck Gypsies (as in *help them* leave that lifestyle because it's *toxic* in the contemporary world. Settling in one permanent place and receiving social support and fulfilling new economic roles would not be the end of their cultural traditions, it would be a new beginning). We need to all take a step back and realize that the Gypsy/Roma/Traveler issue is unique and deserves a new framework in the way it's treated. You can't conflate these things and compare the entire situation to any other while keeping a semblance of credibility. I'm not saying I have all the answers, but surely huge strides can be taken simply by educating people on the nuances of this subject based on available information.

&gt;__Takotsubo cardiomyopathy__, also known as __transient apical ballooning syndrome__,  __apical ballooning cardiomyopathy__,  __stress-induced cardiomyopathy__, __Gebrochenes-Herz-Syndrom__, and __stress cardiomyopathy__ is a type of non-[ischaemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia) [cardiomyopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy) in which there is a sudden temporary weakening of the [myocardium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardium). Because this weakening can be triggered by emotional stress, such as the death of a loved one, a break-up, or constant anxiety, it is also known as __broken heart syndrome__.  Stress cardiomyopathy is a well-recognized cause of acute heart failure, lethal ventricular arrhythmias, and ventricular rupture.

I also don't see why United would particularly want him, he's an attacking midfielder, often on the wings but can play in the middle, and they have players like Nani, Valencia, Januzaj and Mata all as strong choices for attacking midfield spots. Rooney also drops deep enough to take up midfield roles, so I just feel that he'd not be an addition they desperately need.


As for Shaw, time will tell, but I definitely don't think it's as sure fire as people are making out. He's only 18, playing every week, often with other players he's grown up with at the club since he was 8. He's also got a long term contract and would cost a hell of a lot to any team that wants him, enough that they might think twice about paying it for an 18 year old. He's also said things like he hopes Poch gets a new contract and that no-one leave, because the players all seem to really like the manager and are doing great under his leadership and guidance. Maybe money will speak louder than words, but I honestly think he has no intention of leaving, and only would if we accepted a bid and told him to go, then he'd get offered some ridiculous contract.

One example that comes to mind, is that 85% of Australians live relatively close to the coastline, leaving those in-land having less voting power when it comes to federal matters.  It's why local representatives are elected and sent to the capitol, it's why councils exist on a local level and parliament on a national level.

If a majority of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were to strongly oppose leaving the EU, I can guarantee you a referendum would be dispelled pretty quickly.  If a referendum actually came about, it would need to be a strong majority to be legitimate.  We're not as unrepresented as some people in this thread would have you believe, although the population of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is much less than England, we still have a say in UK matters and England alone would not be able to give a strong majority in a referendum.

In the possible event that Northern Ireland alone opposes leaving the EU, then we have a decision to make.  Is it worth leaving the Union to stay with the EU?  That's a tough question to answer, and unfortunately with our age old tribal politics there would most likely not be a balanced review of the pros and cons.  

As far as the EU itself, it has a lot of problems.  Bureaucracy and unelected officials being the major two, and I think talk of a referendum and the hype certain parties are building around it may be a political play to push for a reform in the EU.  The conservatives are seemingly on the fence with the issue because they can use it to potentially get a better deal out the EU, given that a referendum doesn't actually end up being a reality.

true,thatwill,eng-northhamptonshire,Northampton,"Yes, you can argue that the current growth of London is unsustainable, so the level of investment compared to the rest of the country could be considered unjust.

It's irrelevant that other areas currently generate less profit. Investment is what it is: pumping money in, so that more money can be generated.  Currently, investments in London are doing OK, but there's only so much money you can pump in. Eventually that growth will slow, and large investments will not yield growth large enough to make it worthwhile. By that time, it's going to be more of an uphill struggle to grow other areas, considering the stark difference. If you start growth earlier, you're already going to be yielding good profits by that time.

I don't buy the ""London is subsidising the rest of the country"" argument. We're one country, and we should be growing together.

In fact, London receives a proportionally lower level of government money (relative to the amount of money it brings in), than most other parts of the country. London is currently the world's financial capital, and over 20% of the UK's GDP is generated there. In contrast, about 12.5% of the country lives there, and receives a roughly proportional amount of money.

London's GDP per capita stands at around $88,000 (quoted in dollars because that's what the data I calculated it from was quoted in), which is well above what you'd expect if this was primarily due to government investment.

In terms of private sector investment, it doesn't really make sense for primarily service-based international companies to headquarter themselves anywhere else in the UK but London, because that's where everyone else is. It's where the majority of their potential worker pool exists, to be hired/fired to other companies in similar industries, and it's where potential international employees are most likely to want to live.

Just to reply to something you said down here:

&gt;Cities are fine. Note the plural. Investing only in London might seem a fantastic idea to the people who live there, but it's crap for the rest of the country.
With the lack of investment in and around the country, and god help us oop north, it does start to feel malicious.

As evidenced [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/264286/Country_and_Regional_Analysis_2013.pdf), while the per capita spend in London is the highest in real terms within England(referring to total expenditure per head as found on page 13), it isn't as if it is by a massive margin. And in reference to 'oop north', the two regions with the next highest government expenditure within England are the North East and North West. The North really isn't all that hard done by according to the government's released statistics.

This does of course ignore the fact that Scotland has the highest government expenditure of any region quoted, and Wales is well above the national average (it's not broken down, but I suspect that you'd find that Cardiff actually has a significantly higher per capita expenditure than London).

**tl;dr** London actually doesn't have significantly more spent on it by the government than the rest of the country (it does have more, but it's only about 15% above the English average, and is well below the Scottish average), and London's dominance is more a result of its position within the private sector than public spending.",0,1398580645,null,0,false,0,ch35biy,t3_241pwt,t1_ch35biy,t1_ch2syx3,null,1433540130,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

As evidenced [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/264286/Country_and_Regional_Analysis_2013.pdf) it's true that London receives more taxpayer money than other regions of ENGLAND, but the government actually spends more per capita on Scots than Londoners.

Add this to the fact that, while Londoners get 'paid' about 10% more than the national average per capita by the government, they also bring in about 75% more GDP and tax revenue per capita than the national average (approx 22% of GDP is in London, with about 12.5% of the population, working out that an average Londoner brings in 175% of the GDP of the average, or 75% higher). 

These facts together mean that more money is paid in to the government by London than comes out again. In fact, London effectively 'subsidises' the rest of the UK.

true,Silocon,null,null,"Warning, long answer :)

In law you have to pass professional exams to be allowed to do lots of things within the job (mostly: give legal advice and file documents). So you learn on the job, as a trainee. But, as a trainee, all your work has to be checked and approved by someone qualified (an associate or a partner).

Once you qualify, you are made an associate. Sometimes this promotion happens immediately once you qualify, but some firms (such as mine) will want to wait to see if they trust you to do work unsupervised.

Usually, as an associate, you have a ""billing target"" whereby you are expected to bring in a certain amount of money each month. This target will be significantly more than your *salary* because, among other things, it has to pay for your office space, your secretaries, part of your trainees' wages etc. So, overall, you have to be making money for the firm, not costing them. Contrast this with trainees who are a net drain for much of their training.

Now most law firms are ""partnerships"" meaning that the owners of the business also work for the business, they are the partners. In addition to working as lawyers, they have management responsibility, such as performance reviews, strategic planning, hiring/firing.

Once you have been an associate for some years, you might be invited to become a partner. However, becoming a partner means you own a share of the business, which you have to buy. This can be expensive, but some firms will allow you to pay it in instalments.

Once you are an (equity) partner, the money you take home is a percentage of the firm's profits. If the firm doesn't make a profit, you get nothing (or may even be liable for debts, losing your house!). But usually the money a partner takes home is significantly greater than an associate. There are also ""salaried partners"" who have high salaries and management responsibility, but they don't get a percentage of the profits.

Numbers for one of the top UK law firms, Slaughter and May: trainees earn £30-40k/year. Mid level associates earn £90k/year (and at a guess, their billing targets would be £20k/month).

Back in 1997 I was looking at the electronics shops on Tottenham Court Road. This young-looking girl walked up to me and said, ""I ... I want to make love to you."". Meanwhile, and it was obvious, her two friends tried to get behind me to pick my pockets. I'm about 180cm tall, they were about 140cm.

I must have looked like some sad geek standing at a geek shop looking desperate and naive enough to believe that girls walk up to people and ask those sorts of questions.

I turned my head left and right and just stared at the two guys trying to get behind me. They all looked almost embarrassed and then walked away.

One other time I was backpacking in Florence, walking away from the train station, when I saw this gypsy(?) make a beeline for me. Plain as day I could see what the trick was because she was holding a newspaper in an awkward manner with her other arm underneath the paper, ready to rummage around in my pockets. Again, I stared at her but this time I lifted up my fist as if ready to strike. Again, the ""attacker"" realised the game was up and turned away.

Maybe I've had really good gypsies go through my pockets and I never even knew it was happening?",0,1398585645,null,0,1398588933,0,ch36cla,t3_2417xk,t1_ch36cla,t1_ch2y83g,null,1433540615,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7
true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"""The south"" == the south east. Why do people insist on assuming it's all milk and honey in Devon and Cornwall (poorest county in England) too?

The railway (singular) to Somerset/Devon/Cornwall and its branchlines make the main lines to the North look like the TGV and HS2 (which of course you're getting and we're not). We don't have as many pacers but the line can be shit, slow, and chock full of victorian technology that no one wants to upgrade because the lines to the North or the line in South Wales is more deserving. 

The ECML or WCML would not ever be allowed to get into the state where a bit of it could be damaged, causing direct services to London for about a million people to be out of action for months. But that's fine for the south west.

The end result is that driving is hours quicker (and while up north there are motorways everywhere, we couldn't even be bothered to have the motorway run all the way to Penzance, instead there are still huge bits of single carriageway road on our single major trunk road)

The age of the train isn't the problem, it's that the pacer was shit when it was new and is still shit now. The HST is of a similar age and no one says that it's a bad train (it is still better than the new stuff). Of course, in the South West, all of our trains are ""old"", except for the CrossCountry Voyagers which also run up north.

Your current account bank will be able to offer you a credit card most probably. There's normally a clause that they can take money out of your current account to pay the credit card which is why they hand them out like toys. But it will get your credit rating up so you can get the credit cards with incentives. Amazon is great if you use it a lot. 

Also as mentioned in this post you get at least 30 days interest free. If you set up direct debit to pay off in full every month you will never get an interest fee, but you get the benefit of building up your credit rating.

So that's why you think the customer service is shit. Because TalkTalk is about as shit as it gets.

&gt; Also, you just don't get the technical issues with cable internet that you do with DSL. 

No, you get a different set - like signal issues when the amplifiers in the cabinets get too hot or too cold, local congestion because offering 150Mbit on a network where two or three such customers can saturate the network for the remaining hundred or so, problems on the Virgin network itself. Cable internet is nowhere near flawless. The superhub alone is probably a bundle of problems in itself. They really need to get rid of it.

Equipment failure, network issues, someone putting a JCB through cables, bad cable into the home are problems DSL and cable can share.

true,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,"I think it's got a lot to do with perception and how it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, obviously the size of the country factors in too but really in only really in how the people relate to the cities in their areas. The problem we have in England is that cities other than London are considered ""provincial"" which has become synonymous with inferior. Provincialism is only acceptable if you're leaving London for the countryside proper, nobody wants to be in a provincial city. London is where ""things happen"", anyone who's anyone has already left their hometown, cast off their provincial roots and moved to London because that's where the money is. Thus London just reinforces its cultural capital  by sucking in talent and money. Manchester gets a somewhat easier ride because it attempts the same within ""Northern"" culture, but Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool are just left with an increasingly reinforced culturally impoverished vibe despite whatever is done locally to try and combat this. It's actually worse now than it was in the past in my opinion since people relate less to locality and wish more to be seen as top of the food chain. 

Like you mentioned in your post, other countries have a better system, a sort of division of cultural labour that spread things more evenly for example 

Political - Washington DC, Berlin

Financial - New York, Frankfurt

Artistic - Los Angeles, Munich 

Whilst in the UK the answer to where to find everything is London. People then say, well London contributes the most so it deserves the most investment, which just fuels the cycle, of course London contributes the most because everything is there. Provincial cities have really been in the crapper since the collapse of industry in the UK and it's a shame because historically so much of our culture was generated outside of the capital. It's really become absurd, the commuter belt to London now stretches to about 10 miles short of Birmingham.

London attracts more business because it's still slightly attractive to investment, not because of the investment it receives, but no amount of investment will make Lancashire competitive with China on manufacturing, or with the USA on technology, etc etc.

But actually, when we've had road improvement schemes, the opinion is positive. The only seriously delayed project I know of is the one outside my village to build 20 miles or so of dual carriageway, because it's a protected area. It took them a while to sort out a solution to capturing and rehoming some protected species before the road could be built. It has been built and it is a godsend.

It's taken the council and government years to finally agree to start planning on building a 2 mile stretch of dual carriageway to link two bits of dual carriageway together (it's a notoriously bad bottleneck).

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt;I judge them based on their actions. And in my personal experience, whenever gypsies have moved into the area, people have had their shit stolen, and the area they set up camp is completely trashed.

a) Judging individuals based on what other individuals from their grouping have done is the very definition of prejudice

b) The Oxford English Dictionary disagrees with you:

http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/78443?redirectedFrom=gypsy#eid

&gt;A member of a wandering **race** (by themselves called Romany), of Hindu origin, which first appeared in England about the beginning of the 16th c. and was then believed to have come from Egypt. 

c) Personal anecdotal experience would not normally be acceptable justification of racism;  why do you think it would be sufficient to justify your own prejudice?

d) If individual gypsies didn't do anything wrong, you wouldn't notice them.  This is why anecdotal evidence doesn't work as a way of collecting information about the world; you only notice behaviour which impacts on your life (i.e. negative) and which confirms your existing beliefs (confirmation bias).  If a clear majority don't behave in the way your prejudices suggest, you wouldn't ever know.  The majority of gypsies live in houses.

e) If crime occurred or a mess was left by someone of your personal grouping, you would blame the individual, not your own race.  If someone from a group who is 'other' to you does it, you blame the whole group, not the individual.  This is another double standard which demonstrates why personal experience is not a good source.

DSL faults were handled in the same building and were equally well versed. I remember a good few of the team (both 1st and 2nd tier) being taken around a BT exchange and shown everything from where it entered the exchange right up to where it connects to the DSLAM.

The system was essentially to be sure that the problem lied outside of the customer's control (i.e. not a fault with internal cabling or the router) and then escalate to the 2nd tier support, filling out a set of questions and comments on where they suspected the problem was.

I'm not saying they're the best, cos they're not - it's impossible to be the best at the wages they pay. However, the majority working there were definitely people who were good at their jobs and who genuinely wanted to help.

This I really have an issue with. Been seeing more stuff like this recently in the media, that our squad just isn't good enough to compete with the top four. Absolute bollocks. 

The squad is fine, City and Chelsea are the only two clubs I'd say it doesn't compete with. Liverpool have no depth but probably a better first 11, Arsenal I'd say we are maybe slightly worse overall but certainly should be competing with, would take our squad over Everton's and United's is in need of a major overhaul. This squad managed competently should not be being torn apart time and time again by the top four, there's just barely any confidence or form in the squad since we haven't shown the slightest sign of an obvious tactic since about September. Which should be the managers job. 

Look at Liverpool, at the start of the year if someone had told you that they had a better squad than us it would have been laughed off. Yet despite Suarez suspension and an injury to Sturridge (forget when) they've seemingly fired their way to a title while we've got worse. Because their manager had a clear vision for how the squad should play and got them believing in it. We meanwhile got stuck with ""This lineup didn't lose the last game so I'm sticking with it"" Tim.

It does affect what sort of rates the bank is willing to lend you and how much, but it is quite different to any sort of credit history that is established with the CRAs.

It makes the credit card company joint liable with the retailer for any purchase of £100 or over even if just £1 of it is on the credit card. What this means for you is that if you have a problem with something you've bought and the retailer either will not honour the warranty or they've gone bust, you can pursue the credit card company to sort it out. 

Credit cards can be a very advantageous thing if you're the kind of person who has the discipline to pay it off in full every month.",0,1398596993,null,0,false,0,ch382hf,t3_241u2c,t1_ch382hf,t3_241u2c,null,1433541425,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

The Unionists in Ulster didn't manage to stop Home Rule, but they managed to secure their own region in Northern Ireland, which meant most of the UVF supporters drifted away, and the group which revived post-WWI ended up being absorbed into official reservist forces in Northern Ireland. As this didn't involve the actual *use* of the weapons (the relative contribution of threat of violence vs democratic mandate will obviously be disagreed upon), however, the first UVF is largely free to be mythologised as a noble force, who absolutely wouldn't harm an innocent soul and just stood up for what's right. 

Is that true? I think many people would argue that, had things went a bit differently, the civil conflict in Ireland would have ended up just as messy for the UVF as for combatants in pretty much every civil war across the 20th Century. But, things turned out the way they did, the early UVF came out with clean hands, and is thus much more easy to commemorate than the IRA and other factions who ended up with blood (and especially civilian blood) on their hands.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"It's pure racism and should be a clear indication of obvious racism. It is not sensitivity. 

Two reason. Firstly, he doesn't think that being born here and being a citizen gives you any rights because of colour. Thus he's saying being black makes one less equal as a human being than some one who is not. 

This is what racism is in the purest sense, it's the application of differentiation due to the colour of his skin. Nothing else matter to this person - not the fact that Lenny Henry has been a mainstay of the British cultural life for decades. Or the fact that he was born here, or he has lived his life here, or that he has no other place to call home other than this country. 

All that matters is that he is black, and that in of itself, is enough for the UKIP dude to want to send him ""to a black country"". Not even a country that he may actually may have some connection to , such as Jamaica, but a ""black country"". This also tells us that the UKIP person thinks that race also means culture, so he can only think of a British identity that is purely white - and Lenny Henry, being black, has no right to it. Which considering who Lenny Henry is and what he's done - is ridiculous. 

Secondly, when racism was rife, and it was common for people of colour to be targeted for abuse - they were constantly told to ""go back home"". Ask any Asian or Black person who grew up before the late 1990s how many times that particular comment was made. Ask people like Cyril Regis and John Barnes were told they couldn't represent England because they weren't ""English"" and they should go home. 

I hope this corrects your view that this man isn't being racist. He is. It may be without the colourful language or the far-right paraphernalia, but it is racism in its purest form.

Most of the traditional ways to market a product or service - whether that's a flashy toy to the kid who's 8 years old today or a university to the kid who's going to be 18 ten years from now - suffer from a number of drawbacks:

 - They're incredibly expensive. So much so that there is a very real risk you'll never sell enough widgets to cover the cost of the marketing campaign.
 - They're not terribly well targeted. Even if you have something which literally everyone in the world can benefit from, it's impossible to prepare a single marketing campaign that will appeal to literally everyone in the world, and any attempt to do so tends to result in appealing to precisely nobody.

The theory is that if you know more about your customer - not necessarily about individuals, but you have good data on a range of possible customers - you can devise methods to reach them that are better targeted (and hence more effective) and also cheaper.",0,1398598129,null,0,false,0,ch388ls,t3_243g22,t1_ch388ls,t3_243g22,null,1433541504,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

However, if parents were teaching their kids to smoke, then yes, I think I'd be bothered.  And that's how I feel about religion.

&gt;Some theists are indoctrinated, but it seems to me that most are still just born and raised in communities where a belief is held by all those around them, and so they too adopt that belief.

And I disagree!  The religious go to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their children are indoctrinated.  If you grow up in e.g. a Catholic household, then you will be dragged off to church and you could well be sent to a Catholic school where you can receive yet more indoctrination about the tenets of your parents' faith.

Imagine I were a Marxist who took my children each week to an hour long Marxist sermon.  And then I enrolled my children in a Marxist school, where they would learn lessons on how to be a good Marxist.  I also taught my children to learn Marxist songs and I read to them from Marxist books.  Would that not be indoctrination?

true,not_shakey_byrne,null,null,"I was in that funny gap where you had to pay something towards tuition fee but nothing like there is now. Grants were gone too so you got a loan. 

I've no doubt if it was going to cost me £9000 as opposed to the £1300 a year it did I would never have gone. My older sister - by two years - had no tuition fees and received a grant to the tune of £2000 a year. So I was £3300 poorer a year than her before I started. It meant I had to work throughout my university career but I actually don't think that was a bad thing as I got a job related to my degree.

On the other hand if you look at it over the length of a career I think there is a good chance that it would still pay for itself - just in time for you to need a pension probably. But imagine the impact on someone who dropped out or failed exams etc. It boasts the risk across the board - parents or those supporting the student have to ask themselves 'is there a good chance this young adult can achieve a degree?  Are they bright enough?  Are they academic enough? ' I think my parents would have probably thought not - my school career was sub optimal - as it was I did very well at uni.

Even when I was at uni there was about a 1/3 of the year group that was there 'cos that's what you do to put off getting a job'. They would sit a the back of the class laughing and joking and generally being disruptive. They were living at home and uni was just an extension of school to them. I'd like to think they wouldn't be there because the associated costs are so much higher.

I can also say if I was paying that sort of figure I'd see it far more as a very expensive product. That would make me far more demanding of the services I received, there was a lot of silly little things that went on that you just let go like you would in a school or a hospital but I wouldn't with that sort of figure. There was a lot of pointless classes/modules and very poor lecturers. I was on IT, and a non elective module was 'key skills' - how to send an email, how to search Google - it was there to get mature students up to level but it took time out if my timetable that could have gone to more relevant modules and left key skills as an elective.

For me, the centre backs are the only changes that matter. Ivanovic's position will be rusty from not playing CB for several months and I've no idea what Kalas will be like. They're also a new pairing, so won't be that trusting. I'm guessing Kalas has got a bit of pace, being young, but I've read comments that Ivanovic has lost a little of his. Hopefully we can take advantage of this.

The tactical counter point from this will come from Mikel and Matic. Mikel played well against Atletico, and having both of them will provide some extra cover. Matic isn't too slow either.

Overall, a pretty defensive line up that'll be a bit tricky to break down though hopefully some pace and quick breaks later in the game will be useful.

Almost every win under sherwood has been a shit show because of his constant insistence to play without a proper holding midfielder.

We have Sandro and Capoue (when fit) both can tackle pretty fucking hard.  We know that both of them can also score goals and get in dangerous areas.  Sherwood is such a fucking douche canoe that he doesn't play with one, even after getting embarrased and having teams absolutely destroy our back line.

Kane and Ade were literally doing fuck all for most of the game.  They were playing all right individually, but as two up top, it was borderline worthless.  Should have subbed one of them off and pushed gylfi or christian to a #10 and put sandro in a holding role.

true,rniej,null,null,"&gt; Certainly at my CoE primary school your parents could opt you out of the religious gubbins if you wished. Is this not standard practice?

Legally, there is a big distinction between ""voluntary controlled schools"" (which are entirely funded by the government, and in which the associated religious group has less influence) and ""voluntary aided schools"" (where the religious group provides a small proportion of the funding and gets a lot more say).  There is also a difference between areas where religious schools are the only reasonable option, and areas where parents could choose a secular school instead.  There are now also religious free schools and academies, which complicate matters even more.

I went to a voluntary aided C of E primary school, and the religious stuff was so deeply embedded in the curriculum that it would have been impossible to avoid it.  We had a class prayer at the start and end of every day and before lunch time, assemblies tended to be largely about Christianity (and were often led by the local vicar), and the RE lessons were basically just indoctrination sessions.  Once every few weeks, we would go on a trip to the nearby church for some kind of religious service.

Apparently, for voluntary aided schools, the only thing parents can do is demand that their kids are taught RE according to a curriculum agreed with the local education authority, and they can only do that if it would not be possible for their kids to attend a secular school instead.  At voluntary controlled schools, parents have a lot more power (they can insist on the agreed curriculum even if it would have been possible to send their kids to another school).",0,1398603292,null,0,false,0,ch3972p,t3_243dwr,t1_ch3972p,t1_ch38azk,null,1433541957,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Should the town of Coalisland or Crossmaglen be allowed to leave the U.K. because nationalists are a majority in that region?

**Things to do:**

On Fridays, Saturdays and (I think) Tuesdays, you can go see Mick in his van down by the Bullring markets for some pretty decent and cheap meat.

If you like spending loads of money on old things then the Custard Factory is worth a visit.

Jimmy Spices up on Broad Street is the best all-you-can eat buffet ever devised. Go there if you're hungry.

true,Joomes,cnty-uk,London,"But that's not how GDP is measured. If a pound is spent in Glasgow to a company which is headquartered in London, that expenditure will be recorded to Scotland's regional GDP, not to London's. Of course no measurement or analytical method is perfect, and you may get some inaccuracies, but the general analysis is agreed on (broadly) by several different companies who do such analysis.

GDP analysis means that a pound spent in Scotland will go to Scotland's regional GDP regardless of where the company to which it is paid is headquartered. If it's headquartered in California the GDP contribution will still be measured in the UK.

Of course everything I've said above is assuming that you're measuring GDP by expenditure (which tends to be the method most commonly used, as it is easiest to measure, and captures the actual relative spending between different regions. If a region appears to be producing a lot of goods and services, but no money is ever actually spent there, that's a pretty heavy implication that the actual economy of that region is not doing so well).

Another way of measuring it is GVA (Gross Value Added), which effectively compares production and consumption. By this measure, also, you see that Greater London (I was intitially talking about London only, which is actually slightly richer than Greater London per capita, but GVA data doesn't seem to exist for it) has about a 70% greater GVA than the UK average per capita.

No matter which way the data is cut (and the way it is collected is designed to avoid the problem that you mention), you find that London has a GDP per capita that is proportionally higher than the amount of government money spent per capita on it. This means that London actually provides net income to the government rather than the other way around.",0,1398606239,null,0,false,0,ch39wbu,t3_241pwt,t1_ch39wbu,t1_ch37lxo,null,1433542287,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,MMSTINGRAY,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"Well you say that but you'd be surprised how many (self-identified) atheists say that there definitely isn't any type of god or anything. They certainly cannot be described as agnostic atheists.

Also I'm pretty sure you don't mean gnostic, you mean agnostic right? A gnostic atheist doesn't make sense as far as I undestand gnosticism.

We are both obviously familiar with the more specific academic terms but I was talking more generally. And broadly speaking (when talking about relgious beliefs) people who are atheists are people who deny the existence of a god, agnostics beleive that it is unknowable and theists beleive in a god. If you actually look at what atheism means, it comes from a Greek word meaning ""no gods"".  Just like with politics there are many subtleties and -isms but that serves little purpose outside of academic discussion. 

And the whole agnostic atheist thing is kind of strange, although I know it is considered a valid term. An agnostic atheist isn't really an agnostic in my view, because by being an atheist they have to hold an opinion on god (even if they admit it is ultimately unknowable) the passing judgment on something you think it imposisble to know means you aren't following the most basic definition of agnosticism. 

If we wanted to get technical then the terms you use are accurate. Although I'd possibly add ""ireligious"" in because atheists, agnostic, etc don't really describe any of the people who just don't care or are hostile to religion for personal reasons rather than rational ones, and so on.

true,MMSTINGRAY,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"Well I do study history, so I'm probably bias. 

But I think my point is still valid. Whether you like it or not religion, especially Islam and Christianity are going to be considered as important and formative for at least the next millenium.

You are right that many people aren't familiar with important historical events. That doesn't make the events unimportant or change the fact that the world would probably be a better place if we learned more from history. So maybe people should know more of this stuff and not forget it. 

But even with the ignorance of history that many people have most people know a little bit about the Roman Empire right? And can probably say at least one thing that the ""romans gave us"". I think Christianity and Islam will be comparable to the view people have of the Roman Empire. That doesn't mean people won't view the religious beliefs as outdated or wrong or whtaever (no one beleives in the Roman gods do they?) but that doesn't mean we still can't learn a lot from it.

Christianity and Islam have literally shaped the world we live in since the collapse of the Roman Empire. Technology is another large factor but the way technology developed, spread and was used was largely down to religion. Infact without religion we would have lost even more of the technological, scientific and philosophical knowledge that we have today. I would say this isn't even a Euro-centric view as Islam spread into Africa, Asia and parts of Europe and Christianity spread all over the world and in both cases the relgiions greatly influenced the way people interacted with no cultures. 

I'm not trying to defend religion, you can think it is stupid or pathetic or whatever. I'm not religious myself. I'm trying to argue against the idea that we should be glad about any form of ignorance revolving around something so important.

Remember that most arguments against religion are ultimately an argument against ignorance. So it is no good replacing one form of ignorance with another. Man kind needs to remember the past and learn from it's mistakes. 

I apologise because I realise that you probably just said it as a throw away comment and now I'm dissecting what you said. But I still think it is sad that anyone would ""dream"" of a day when ignorance about important things is something to be glad about.

1) Chelsea are the biggest cunts in the league full stop.

2) Chelsea are looking weak on the wings ATM. Unfortunately we have no target man to strike fear into them. Nothing we can do about that unfortunately

3) Lucas is looking poor. 424 in second half with Sturridge on for Lucas. Its more aggressive but we have to win or at least draw this game.

4) Schwarzer is also a massive cunt

5) Azpillicueta has an annoying face

6) Ashley Cole needs to exploited. He's been very weak so far. His offense has been good but his defence has been average at best.

7) Chelsea ALWAYS have four men back. The fact that they're not chasing the game means that their one nil lead will probably force more back.

Final though: The stars are fucking aligned IMO. Something complete and utter bullshit will happen and it will be in our favour. COME ON YOU REDS, DO IT FOR OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR BRENDAN.

Side note: Crystal Palace are fucking gods at home, and if they hold City us losing isn't actually too much of a disaster.

Third-ish hand I've heard a great story about him: a couple of postgrad students were walking back to college from a lecture or something and they pass a group of bible-bashing evangelical Christians preaching on the sidewalk only about a hundred meters before they see Dr (Doctor, Lord? I don't know what title to use) Williams walking in the opposite direction to them. Being at Magdalene they recognise him, introduce themselves as students at his college, and inform him about the group of people proselytising further along to see what he does. They of course go back along with him to see what happens from a distance.

They proceed to watch him have a short but good-natured argument about various aspects of Christianity, during which the man he is debating gets visibly more irritated. Eventually, he explodes with ""Well, you OBVIOUSLY haven't read the Bible then"" at Dr Williams. Dr Williams smiles and replies, quite calmly, ""Well you clearly don't know quite who I am"" and walks on, leaving the man to (presumably) wonder what the hell that was all about.

&gt;contribution to the religious debate 

The meme thing itself is more of a contribution to sociology, rather than the specific philosophical debate over religion. 

&gt;just a rehashing of old one

I can't remeber the names now but Dawkins only really came up with the term, the ideas behing the meme concept are almost entirely other people's. Dawkings admits this himself and there is nothing wrong with standing on the shoulder's of giants. What annoys me about this isn't Dawkins, it's how people give him much more credit than he is due and seem to be ignorant of the work that Dawkins built on. 

&gt;He's an arrogant tool 

I probably didn't make it clear that the fact I don't like his attitude and personality (because he's a tool in my eyes) is a seperate issue to why I don't like other people's attitude towards him (because it seems ignorant and full of mindless praise).

&gt;which is a concept you are lauding in your review of that book.

I have at no point criticsed the concept. I said ""Anyway the mind-virus..."" which was meant to indicate me finishing moaning about Dawkins and simply reccomending an interesting fiction book on the concept that was being discussed. 

But even if I thought the meme concept was a load of shit that wouldn't mean I couldn't still enjoy a fiction book based on the idea. But I don't, the ideas of memes seems highly plausible.

Stealing Banksy? Meet the man who takes the street art off the street

Tony Baxter has become the go-to guy for anyone wanting to shift – and flog – a Banksy mural.



Art curators aren’t usually the targets of hate mail and death threats.

But then Tony Baxter (who has received messages informing him “there's a bullet with your name on it” and whose staff are regularly accused of being thieves who “are going to die of cancer”) isn't your average custodian of culture.

The former model, investment banker and cross-Channel swimmer has become the go-to guy for anyone wanting to shift – and flog – a Banksy mural.

It all started when “Slave Labour” was painted on the side of a Poundland shop in Wood Green, north London, just before the Queen's diamond jubilee in May 2012. A few months later, the work, featuring a boy hunched over a sewing machine stitching union flag bunting, had been chainsawed off the wall before vanishing.

“No one knew where it was, and our whole goal as a concierge is that we're supposed to be the best-connected network in London,” says Baxter, in his first proper interview.

The director of The Sincura Group, which aims to fulfil every whim of its VIP members, adds: “It just so happened that a client said, ‘find the answer to ‘Slave Labour’’. The council did bugger all; they just sat there and drank tea.”

Sincura located the work in a Miami auction house and flew it back to London to see if a buyer with at least £900,000 in spare change could be found so the street art could be kept in the UK.

The Sincura name was splashed across the media and Baxter says he now gets about ten emails a week from people asking him to remove what they assume to be Banksys from their buildings.

The 39-year-old son of a Cambridge academic has since overseen the “salvaging” of three other murals across Britain and has got hold of a further five.

They form what is the most expensive collection of the artist’s work ever assembled under one roof – the Stealing Banksy? exhibition, which opened at the ME London hotel today. The show concludes on Sunday when all the pieces go under the hammer (total estimates stand at £5m).

Baxter does not own any of the works, and he insists he has never made a penny in profit from the sale of any piece taken from a building, nor has he ever approached anyone to remove one.

What he does get is “a small management fee that covers just a fraction of my staffing and insurance costs”; a strange kind of kudos for his company; and “a good way to entice people” to buy the Banksy canvases he sells, where he does get a cut.

Baxter also has ethical conditions that must be met. The owners must be intent on removing the piece regardless; they must have at least one non-financial motive (for example, fearing a grade II listing as a result of the graffiti); and he insists on some kind of charitable donation.

Has Baxter had any contact with the man himself? “I, I, I can't comment on any of my involvement with Banksy,” he says. It is the only time he hesitates.

The works are being taken from communities and will likely end up in an plutocrat's mansion. But he claims: “We're restoring these for ever. In 100 years’ time, or 1,000 years’ time, when these are the old masterpieces they may have become, they’ll still be around. We can’t stress enough – if you're going to do it, do it properly. You wouldn’t take the Mona Lisa and chop it in half.

“At the end of the day, we sleep easy at night knowing that what we’re doing is legal. It may not be the most ethically sound – but it is the lesser of two evils.”

true,Joomes,cnty-uk,London,"No it's not. Government expenditure in London is only about 10% higher than the UK average, which does not go anywhere near explaining the differences in general wealth. London makes more money because of private sector investment, which does not rely directly on government funding, but which is helped by it.

In general, a government pound spent in London on a tax break for a business will generate more wealth from international business for the country than an equivalent action will generate elsewhere in the UK. Removing public funding from London and giving it to, say, Birmingham isn't going to make Birmingham an attractive place for international businesses to settle overnight. In effect, you would harm London's economy more than you would help Birmingham's.

Note that I'm talking about existing expenditure and redistributing it. There's no reason we couldn't, for example, increase expenditure in Birmingham or Manchester at a greater rate than we increase it in London in the future until we reach parity of expenditure. This would be a much safer route than widespread redistribution of existing government spending and grants.

At the end of the day, though, London's income for the country far outstrips the drain it puts on the government's resources. GDP per capita in London is about 70-75% higher than the national average, with about 10% higher per capita spending. No matter how you present that, you end up showing that London brings in more money to the exchequer than it takes out again, compared to the national average.

true,MMSTINGRAY,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"You know being deliberately selective over your arguments that are anti-relgious is just as annoying and pointless as when religious people do it. 

The Bible is quite clearly open to interpretation. Even from a belieivers standpoint most people accept that it was written by men, men are fallible, therefore it isn't the exact word of god. If we pretended for a second that there definitely is a god then this line of reasoning is perfectly reasonable. And as people who are religious either belieive in, or are open to the possibility, of there being gods it is quite clear how and why they feel that there isn't any ""one true word"" of god.

How many Christians or religious scholars do you know, in England, who beleive that the Bible is literally the word of god beamed onto paper/into people's minds? Because anyone who doesn't belieive that is instantly admitting that the bible is open to interpretation. 

I might not be religious but that doesn't mean I can't put myself in the shoes of someone who does believe and try and follow their reasoning. 

Also I have a feeling you are going to argue with me about why they are wrong. Don't waste your time, I'm not religious, I'm not saying that is true. I'm simply saying that if we accept that god is real, for the sake of argument, then there is no logical reason that the bible has to be treated as the one true word of god and therefore it is silly to talk about you only being able to believe one thing or you aren't really Christian.

Agnosticism (as the name suggests) is the opposite, where you do not claim to know with utmost certainty. The jury is still out, as you say.

You're still thinking of it wrong. It's not a linear scale With Theism at one end, Atheism at the other and Agnosticism in the middle. It's a chart with Belief and Certainty as its axes.

- To have high belief but no certainty makes you an agnostic theist. To have have high belief and high certainty makes you a gnostic theist.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;How much does 'the region' actually matter though?

Apparently quite a lot to modern republicans, why did it matter then? Quite simply the same reason it does now, the right to self determination, the same argument as why someone in England has a right to have a say in how Ireland is run can be applied to Cork and Belfast.

&gt;They were a minority in Ulster and they wanted the whole province.

They wanted to allow the most unionists as possible the ability to remain in the UK, all of Ulster was not feasible outcome, nor the desired outcome but was a cause to get people rallied around, when the majority of those people got that it was deemed good enough. 

&gt;Nationalists are a majority in Fermanagh; should the county of Fermanagh be allowed to leave the U.K.?
Should the town of Coalisland or Crossmaglen be allowed to leave the U.K. because nationalists are a majority in that region?

What are your proposed area sizes here, town by town? Village by village? Property by property?  The latter certainly gives the most choice and freedom but has the possibility of being unruly and bring up a west Berlin type situation. 

&gt;As they never fired their guns against any foe or civilian in Ireland
They used the threat of violence though, and it worked. Are you saying they would never have used their guns if they had too? 

I'm not saying that fighting for rights or a cause is wrong, but the way in which you fight, attacks on noncombatants are certainly wrong, an attack on someone who is willing and accepts the consequences, like a soldier is a different manner.

&gt;They were able to use their names publicly because there was no threat of being jailed, despite planning to use violence against the government.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Well considering Katyn and Churchill's inability to save Poland... 

Edit: I don't understand the downvote, which is fine, but just to elaborate on my comment:-

Polish officers were executed by Stalin's order at the Katyn massacre. Churchill was always keen that Poland should be reconstituted as a country and saved but the massacre at Katyn, when he was told, finally showed him that this wasn't possible. He couldn't do anything about the stated British war aim, which was to free Poland, it would end up as part of the Soviet Bloc after the war, and with it's borders changed in the east due to the Molotov-Robentrop pact.

This meant that Polish officers and pilots faced a choice of going back to a Soviet controlled country, where a lot of them would be considered anti-soviet and thus executed. Which may have informed some of the choices to stay.  Churchill was always bitter about this, and some even blame him for the situation and his inability to force Stalin to abide by their initial understanding on Poland.

Here's a bio on General Stanislaw Sosabowski that demonstrates what I mean:

&gt;""Shortly after the war Sosabowski succeeded in bringing his wife and only son from Poland. Like many other Polish wartime officers and soldiers who were unable to return to Communist Poland he settled in West London. He found a job as a factory worker at the CAV Electrics assembly plant in Acton.[2] He died in London on 25 September 1967. It has been suggested that until his funeral at which his rank and achievements were read out, many of his friends and workmates in England were largely unaware of his military accomplishments. His remains were re-interred in 1969, at Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw, Poland.""

true,Vardy,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"I wouldn't go back if it was £3K.

By the end of my 2 year course, I was down £12K due to tuition and maintenance loans and quite frankly I did not get my moneys worth. The increase in prices does not mean an increase in standards. It just promotes universities to take on as many as they can and hope a few drop out after signing their loan agreements. It's a cash grab.

In the current job market, your certificates don't mean crap to most employers. They want to see someone with a working background and real-life experience. Education is now all about the promise that a certificate will get you your dream job. I can take a crash course on almost any subject and pass an exam about it in a month, but it doesn't mean I know anything.

Advice I currently give is to go to college and get some good knowledge for free for as long as you can. Then get on the job ladder. Start at the bottom and work your way up, it will take you a couple of years to get to a good level, but you are earning money whilst getting valuable skills.

He knew we'd be attacking from the start. He knew they needed just one goal. Say what you like -- it was a boring display from Chelsea, a negative tactic, anti-soccer (football, whatever, I'm from America), but it comes down to this: Chelsea neutralized the league's best attack, and caught us when we were vulnerable. The chances they had, they took. They limited us to shots from distance and set-pieces. They frustrated our offense, took the edge off our attack by blocking key passing routes, pressed us well from their edge of the box. They left very little to chance, and stifled any chances of magic.

The way Chelsea played made me sick. That said, this is just another form of ruthlessness.

2 matches to go... this season is giving me a heart attack...

Edit: Be honest with yourselves. If Rodgers, for one reason or another, decided on a similar tactic and we ground out a 1-0 win, he would be praised for masterminding a defensive stratagem. Praising Mourinho is not equivalent to blaming Rodgers for this loss. Both managers knew what the other's tactic was going to be... but whose came off, and whose didn't?

This is expensive for them to do, but for them to operate requires user's trust (Ignoring the fact that they were previously aware of the activity and didn't do anything...). [GCHQ's existing wiretapping techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora) are no longer effective because it's non-trivial for them to collect and read the data as it moves over those connections. Intelligence, especially signals intelligence, is time-sensitive so while they can decrypt this traffic given enough time it may not be fast enough (or computationally too expensive) to do on a broad scale. This is because they are carrying out *Mass Surveillance* rather than targetted policing.

&gt;One of the fears is that intelligence officers will lose the ability to monitor the safety threat posed by British jihadists travelling to Syria

This is entirely their own fault. Previously they could get a court order to access this information under the [European Data Retention Directive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Retention_Directive). This has been ruled invalid as a reaction to GCHQ and the NSA's spying efforts by other European nations. A couple of articles by the ORG discussing the ruling - [1](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2014/are-the-government-and-isps-breaking-the-law-by-continuing-to-retain-our-data) and [2](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2014/back-to-the-coalition-agreement-data-retention-laws-should-not-be-revived)

Basically, our intelligence services are acting like a bunch of bastards and Europe is calling them out on it. I am not implying that other European nations are innocent, because they are not either.

It may also be GCHQ's way of getting the coalition government to throw them a bone and pass some legislation to carry on what they were doing before the EDRD was invalidated.

I feel going atletico route was not correct. We have not played Crosses into the box or long shots all season, and we really saw today, that when a team does not let us slice them apart we have no real plan B, We were found out today mostly because Gerrard made an honest mistake, but then carried that into the second half, which I would not expect to see from him to be honest, and Coutiniho was a bit wasteful, It just became a game of firing cannon balls at the fortress of blue players, which was disappointing to watch. 

Disappointed that the style of football that won today was very souless, and Mouriniho screaming was annoying. 

Bad times to be honest with you. 

Life goes on, we are not on the canvass yet, but this game now on, will be interesting to watch.

I mean, £150k, *a house*, for 533 people. Realistically I doubt I'd buy 533 people a house each (I'd want to diversify, offer people grants for cultural projects, etc), but imagine being able to make it so that 533 people never had to worry about rent or mortgage payments ever again, never had to live with that financial burden and have the roof over their heads at the mercy of a faceless and uncaring bank corporation.

Homelessness is a massive issue in society, and although often drugs are related, I don't think that's a good excuse to condemning someone to denial of their human rights to reasonable living conditions. How are people supposed to get themselves out of that situation when they have no money at all to arrange a postal address (necessary for most benefit applications) and make themselves presentable for job applications? I would *love* to be able to go up to a homeless person, give them a few hundred quid and tell them I have paid in advance for a hotel room in their name for a month or so, and that this is their opportunity to get their lives back on track. It's not that some people are just inherently scrapheap material, I really believe that. But people are time and again denied opportunities to improve their lives, and it's often ignored that the more money a person has, the cheaper it is to live.

&gt; “The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.
&gt; 
&gt; Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.
&gt; 
&gt; But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.
&gt; 
&gt; This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.” (Terry Pratchett)

That being said I approached his performance today with an open mind, and aside from that shitty corner, I did notice that he *did* help us with link up play. Before he came on, Suarez was dropping deep a lot, which is fine, but that means he is less involved w the end product, and it makes us work through the center. Bringing Aspas on allowed Suarez to stay in the box, while Aspas worked to pull off defenders and work the ball wide. This was perfectly clear with a good Sterling run and cross that Aspas helped facilitate after he came on.

I don't necessarily think that was because of Aspas's quality, but rather more because of our tactics.

Others view it more as a place of punishment by material methods. This view along with the annihilation of a sinners soul are less popular in the European christian tradition, but still reasonably popular in the American faith.

Whilst the Catholic church itself is quite non committal about the specific nature of hell it states in the Catechism of the Catholic Church  'Hell's principal punishment consists of eternal separation from God in whom alone man can have the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs'

&gt; ""The former foreign secretary Jack Straw believes opening the UK’s borders to eastern European migrants was a “spectacular mistake” that he “deeply regrets”

Just take a look at the US, NZ, Australia and other similar countries immigration policies, and you will see that the UK is far more lenient than any of them. Having a tougher policy is not being racist, it's just simple economics. And there is nothing wrong with a country looking after the people it has living there first, wether they be immigrants or ethnic nationals, before it focuses on bringing more people in.

I think he is right about the public sector cuts. They aren't pleasant, but unless you want a situation like Greece or Spain, you cannot leave the deficit alone and let it grow to an unmanageable scale. There is not much point discussing UKIP's policies in too much detail yet, as they are still working them out for the 2015 manifesto. What is for sure is that having an unmanageable influx of low skilled workers puts an even harder strain on the public sector. Lowering that will allow for less drastic measures. Also with foreign aid not being a factor, there will be more cash available to work with. 

And don't say outrageous things like hundreds of thousands of people will be left on the edge of starvation. The left are constantly complaining about UKIP using scaremonger tactics. Does that mean they are allowed to?

They might seem to attract more racists than other parties, but how many racists have there been? In fact it's probably even less than 1% as I could count on my fingers, on one hand the amount of people in UKIP (a party with thousands of members) that have said anything that could be racist and they've all been swiftly dealt with. Or is everybody in UKIP racist until proven innocent? While, everybody in other parties is non-racist until proven guilty?

In which case, name a racist UKIP agenda? Controlling immigration and favouring their own citizens over other countries, isn't racist (even though it might attract some racists, for their own reasons). If it were racist, then the EU (as a whole) and every country outside of the EU would be racist for doing the same. 

UKIP just want a system of work permits like Australia has, that favours European citizens *equally* to other countries and they're made to seem like xenophobic, racist, neo-Nazi, nationalist, fascist, European hating extremists for it.

If someone told any of us at the beginning of the season that this was going to be the case, we would have all jumped around like maniacs with the joy of it. But we have already done so much more. We can still win the title, and if we don't I'll be as gutted as any of you, but even if that happens (and I still think it's a big if), we have played some unbelievable football, got some amazing results and the sheer pride and exultation I feel again in being a Liverpool fan, is priceless!

This was always going to be fighting against Chelsea's parking the bus from minute one. They did well what they do well. It's ugly-ass football, and I think it's inexcusable in a team that expensive, but we knew that was what was going to happen. We needed to find an answer and we haven't quite managed that. But this needs to be put into perspective, this loss has come after an amazing 11 games winning streak. As much as I loathed to admit it, we were always going to slip some time. It's gutting that it's against Chelsea, but would it be any better if it were against Palace? Or Newcastle? At least now, we're still in with a chance.

We still have a game in hand over everyone below us except for Sunderland. However, even if we don't score another point this year (which unfortunately may happen) two of the four things would need to happen.

-Norwich beats and draws with Chelsea and/or Arsenal

-Sunderland at least beat Man U, Swansea or West Brom and get a better goal differential than us after those games (theirs is 3 goals lower than ours).

We shouldn't be in a position where we have to count on other teams losing, however there is a chance that we might have to.  It's ridiculous, and unacceptable.

Liverpool play attractive, attacking football. Their fans should be proud of their team and the way they perform every week, not moaning over a 0 - 1 home loss to Mourinho (one of the greatest tacticians in the modern game).

Yeah we can criticize a team that are 19th under Roy Hodgson playing shit football, which is were we where three and a half years ago but to criticize a team that is the middle of a title race with two games to go, coming off an 11 game winning streak is ludicrous.

true,Joomes,cnty-uk,London,"Actually that is not how it works, because of private investment. A pound spent in London on promoting business gets a better return than spending a pound elsewhere, in general.

A wide variety of types of private enterprise exist, and it makes more sense to invest in, say, car manufacture outside of London, but the UK's economy is predominantly service-sector based, so the skew for spending on private enterprise is and should be towards London overall. There is also a place for other kinds of investment; for example, Cambridge is another good place to invest in research-based business, as it is already home to one of the world's most successful high-tech centres of business.

Essential services such as police, hospitals, fire departments etc. should definitely be funded to the same degree everywhere. The difference lies in investment that is aimed at promoting economic growth. It makes more sense to invest in areas which are likely to produce a larger economic output as a result. It is this extra economic output that increases the funding available in the future for essential services. Unless you are founding or pioneering a new industry of some kind, it just makes more sense to invest preferentially in areas that are already producing more highly, as private investors are going to be more willing to invest in those areas.

**tl;dr:** spending on essential services should definitely be equal (or skewed so that service is of equal quality) across the country, but it does not make sense for the government to invest in, say, tax breaks for start-up financial companies in Birmingham instead of London, or in tech companies in Yorkshire instead of Cambridgeshire. *The output from that investment is what PAYS for the essential services*",0,1398615776,null,0,false,0,ch3d8th,t3_241pwt,t1_ch3d8th,t1_ch3bylt,null,1433543929,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I would like to prelude by saying I HATE having to rely on other fixtures and I HATE how poorly we have been playing.  However I'm going to look at this logically and take emotion out of it. With our dire form it looks like we might not get anymore points this season (although we do have three games left so technically the math is in our favor to get more points).

However even if we lose every game the rest of the season at least TWO of the following things NEEDs to happen in order for us to go down.

-Cardiff beats Newcastle AND Chelsea

-Fulham beats Stoke AND Crystal Palace (a win and a draw would but them equal on points but the goal differential is not even close)

-Norwich beats and draws with Chelsea and/or Arsenal

-Sunderland at least beat Man U, Swansea or West Brom and get a better goal differential than us after those games (theirs is 3 goals lower than ours).
 
So sorry friends, but I disagree. Mathematically speaking we don't ""NEED"" any points against Hull.  In fact we are still more than likely going to stay up with no more points at all this season.

I would never agree to discriminating against a group just because of their race.

But I see no problem when it comes to culture.

In the romani traveller culture, non-romani are called ""gadjos"" or ""gadjes"".

These gadjos are consider as ""impure"" and only those following Romani Code are ""pure"".

It is fine in their culture to steal from from gadje.

Have a look at:  http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Principles_of_Sociology/Roma_Issues

Seems like if people are going to attack 'gypsies' they should understand what the word means according to the OED.

Also, gypsies are part of a rich cultural tradition going back hundreds of years.

But on the flip side people will say they are ""non religious"" in the sense of not subscribing to organised religion or not going to church regularly while still believing in some sort of god or other supernatural being.

-UKIP wants to increase the army by 25%, increase military funding by 40% and buy nuclear weaponry from the Americans. Do we really need a bigger army? We're not in danger of an invasion from anybody right now (apart from maybe the Falklands and Gibraltar but it's more likely they'll be settled diplomatically)  and throwing money to make our army more bloated then Ed Balls just seems silly. We don't need a big army any more. Do you not find it quite funny that they oppose foreign intervention yet want to make our army bigger? [Source] (http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/08/why-does-ukip-oppose-defence-cuts-if-it-wants-end-foreign-wars)

-UKIP want's to increase funding in coal producing, is opposed to creating windmills and is sceptic of climate change. This is something I find absolutely ridiculous and something you would more likely see in American politics. We all know climate change is happening and instead of trying to stop it, Mr. Farage want's to pump more Co2 into the air. Windmills are ugly but I would rather look at ugly windmills for the rest of my life then watch my children grow up wearing oxygen masks. An over-exaggeration maybe but the idea of climate change is very quickly becoming true. [Source] (http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/04/ukip-energy-climate-policies)

-UKIP supports re-arming the population with hand guns [Source] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10595087/Hand-guns-should-be-legalised-and-licensed-Nigel-Farage-has-said.html), wants to abolish the Human Rights Act 1998 and stop promoting multiculturalism. [Source] (http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/07/ukip-policies-manifesto-commitments).

-You can say that UKIP isn't racist. And maybe you're right. But the racist element is still there. William Henwood said just yesterday that Lenny Henry should go live in 'some black country', Andre Lampitt has posted all manner of vile shit on twitter, saying that Africans will be left to die and that he supports all Muslims leaving Britain and Peter Lagoda is talking about wogs and Mongols with slanty eyes in Cambridgeshire. Like it or not, UKIP has attracted quite a few racists in the party and it's not the first time that they've been in racism controversies.

true,widgetas,null,null,"The 'uproar' would be because of the way in which the claim ""Britain is a Christian country"" will be used, as well as it not being entirely accurate. The phrase has different meanings: currently Christian in the majority? Historically? Culturally? Practicing religious? etc.

The most pernicious usage would be to claim, as some people do and are, that Britain has a majority of the population who are Christian and therefore that it is right and fair that Christianity and Christians are given a dominant post in society, parliament, the law etc.

All in all, it plays back into a feedback loop: Britain is a Christian country because we have an established church because Britain is a Christian country because we have Bishops in the Lords because Britain is a Christian country because because most people are Christian because Britain is a Christian country because we all celebrate Easter and Christmas because Britain is a Christian country because we have lots of faiths schools because Britain is a Christian country because...

Try and remove any one of those institutions or notions and the loop kicks in. It's worth noting, though, that one of the 'reasons' from the loop has been waning in the last few decades: church attendance is at an all time low and so can't be used to bolster the arguments for Britain being a Christian country. Instead it is said that ""Attendance doesn't matter, Britain is a Christian country because [something else from the loop].""

true,joeflux,null,null,"&gt; Seems like if people are going to attack 'gypsies' they should understand what the word means according to the OED.

In English, the dictionary attempts to describe the meaning as used by people.  In French it's the other way around and so only if we were french might you have a point.

[From wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsy_%28term%29#Use_in_English_law)

&gt; Under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960, 'gipsies' are defined as ""persons of nomadic habit of life, whatever their race or origin, but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen, or persons engaged in travelling circuses, travelling together as such.""

So there go.  Nothing to do with race, but to do with the habit and culture.

&gt; Also, if you redefine the term as being people who conform to your pre-existing stereotypes, then your argument is circular and you're commiting a classic example of the No true Scotsman fallacy

Not quite.  Have a look at the wikipedia link that I gave - it is clear that there are multiple meanings.  Attempting to force one meaning when other people clearly mean another meaning is the fallacy.

&gt; You're not a real gypsy because ...
 
The funny part is that the very people that you are insisting are gypsies will themselves refuse to label themselves as gypsies.

It's also interesting how much you are working to try to put words into my mouth.  I've noticed this a lot - why is it that you're so scared to debate what I actually say, rather than trying to make up what you think I'm saying?

You will find a lot of atheists (certaintly most atheists I know) that would violently disagree with the notion that we're agnostics. Me included. 

That does **not** mean we necessarily believe that it is *impossible* for there to be a god (though there are atheists that do indeed believe that the very notion of a god is impossible), but that we consider the likelihood of the existence of a God to be so infinitesimally small, that for all practical intents we know that God does not exist the same way we would say we know that Santa Claus does not exist, or that we know that the dinosaurs are extinct even though it is *possible*, though the chance is infinitesimally small, that it'll turn out that there are still dinosaurs in some alien zoo. 

You could argue that this is still agnosticism, but in that case the term becomes meaningless, as we can not have absolute knowledge of something, and so in that case very single one of us is agnostic. For the term to make sense, then, it is more natural to consider someone agnostic when they themselves express *doubt* about whether or not God exists.

Absent evidence, I don't doubt the non-existence of God. For me to open the door to doubt, would take evidence.

If you bought a £325,000 property on a 2-year 2.25% fixed rate mortgage (the best deal Natwest offer for example) then you're repayments would be £1276 a month. After the 2 years if your rate went up to 4.25% you'd pay about £1590 a month.

Obviously the difference here is you would effectively be paying **yourself** £1276 a month, rather than another persons mortgage as happens when you rent. In theory the house could devalue and you could lose some of the value. If that happened (long term), it would be the first time in about 50 years unless there are specific pressures in your area (e.g. it turns into a massive crack-den). So in a way, you can think of it as paying yourself rent. In 25 years time you would have an asset worth the £325,000 you paid plus any increase in value that has occured over that 25 years... and considering prices look like they have risen by about 10% (8% more than inflation) this year you could be looking at making a substantial amount of money. The danger you will face, is if you buy now while prices are so inflated by low supply - is that if in years to come supply pressures ease AND interest rates go up, you could end up in negative equity and unable to meet the monthly repayments... although in reality this is pretty rare and tends to happen to people that are either unlucky or stupid.

It is worth bearing in mind though, a lot of people buy property without really understanding the fact that even 0.5 - 1% increases in the annual interest on a large amount like £325,000 equates to an additional £1625 - £3250 interest per year on the full amount. If rates went up to 7% you'd probably find you can't make the repayments/ 

The problem you will have, as first time buyers, is that in order to get those sort of interest rates, you'll need access to a lump of cash round £40K on that size property to put down a deposit + pay surveys/agents/solicitors fees and to buy some basic furniture etc. Like a lot of people, unless your parents are wealthy and prepared to send some of it your way, then its going to be **very** hard to save up £40K whilst simultaneously renting.

Even if you can rent for £500 a month each, and each put aside £500 a month, it will take you a minimum of 3 years to save up that sort of deposit... and in reality I can tell you that even earning £35K a year, its **very** hard to save up that sort of cash whilst renting if you're in the Southeast/London.

It wasn't uproar, it was correcting and/or refuting. What Camleron said was essentially pandering to religious groups and stoking future arguments that could result in religious privilege being kept the same, or increased, in society, laws etc. British people are becoming less and less religious. This is an undeniable fact yet we, in general, are constantly being told by various areas of government, the media and groups that we are religious, that we think religion is important and that religion has a major role to play. This simply isn't true - at least certainly religion doesn't have anything that can't be, or isn't, done by other non-religious groups. 

&gt; Hell, even the vast majority of court sessions involve Bibles being brought out at least once or twice.

Many had to campaign and fight for the right to affirm rather than swear on the bible - including in Parliament ([Charles Bradlaugh being the appropriate figure to cite to reflect this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bradlaugh#Parliament)). How many people know they can affirm rather than swear on the bible? How often do you see it in court room or police dramas? Just because it's still done a good deal doesn't really indicate religiosity. In any case there are such factors as social pressures involved. [Did you hear about Cherie Booth-Blair's comments a couple of years back?](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8497365.stm)

&gt; If you're an atheist in England and get married, the chances are you'll be doing it in a Christian church

Even if this were true (jay_vee has demonstrated otherwise) is that because people feel Christian, or because they think they're supposed to, or because it's a pretty building and ceremony? 

[When we have had laws that require people to attend church on a Sunday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Uniformity_1558), it's somewhat unfair to claim that ""We were Christian"" - how could you not be, when the law required it? Obviously that was repealed (not entirely sure when) but the point stands in outlining how the claim is still made with regard to other things i.e.

&gt; We literally have a Church of England.

If you rent you get none back if you move.  
A mortgage will go towards the house and also paying of the mortgage interest. When you move you'll get the part that goes towards the house back, and maybe a bit more, assuming the market doesn't tank.

If you rent you aren't responsible for repairs to the property, or footing the bill. With buying a house you have to cover the cost and manage all repairs.

People go either way with Mourinho, either he is a genius who outclassed us with his tactics, or he is a dick who plays 19th century football. 
The truth is that he knew exactly what to do to stop us scoring, and once he had done that, all he needed was a mistake or a bit of luck and they could win the game. He set his team up well, and the players executed the plan perfectly.

But like you said, I could never support a team who just sit back and don't play with any style or skill. It's effective but boring to watch. If Liverpool played that way I probably wouldn't want to watch them every week, I watch football for the excitement and the passion, Chelsea don't seem to have any of that when they play.

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt;In English, the dictionary attempts to describe the meaning as used by people. In French it's the other way around and so only if we were french might you have a point.

You're right, they attempt to describe the meaning as used by people; not just prejudiced people, or people you agree with, but all people.  The fact that they chose to define it that way should tell you something.

&gt;So there go. Nothing to do with race, but to do with the habit and culture.

As defined in one particular law, yes, granted.  Though interestingly it wasn't in the original 1960 law.  Those words were inserted as part of the 1994 law which withdrew the obligations of local councils to provide authorised sites to travellers.  Either way, as you say, the OED uses common use of the people to determine its definitions, so the fact it chose to define it that way is significant.  They obviously don't think Michael Howard had the capacity to redefine away a race. 

&gt;Attempting to force one meaning when other people clearly mean another meaning is the fallacy.

Seems like you're the one picking and choosing definitions.  I have no doubt that when some people in this thread use the term 'gypsy' they have a certain 'type' of person in their head, just as when racists use the term 'black people' and anti-semites use 'jew'.  But the definitions can't be so fluid as to match the individual prejudices.  You must see that this is problematic.

&gt;The funny part is that the very people you are insisting gypsies will themselves refuse to label themselves as gypsies.

This doesn't really make any sense as a sentence, but it seems like you're putting words in people's mouths just before accusing me of doing the same.  If you're still confused about how gypsies and travellers define themselves, look at this:

http://gypsy-traveller.org/pdfs/common_myths.pdf

&gt;Myth: All Travellers live in caravans

&gt;There are estimated 300,000 Gypsies and Travellers in the UK, two thirds of who live in ‘bricks and mortar’ (houses). There are an estimated 25,000 Travellers in the UK with no place to legally stop and thus with ‘no fixed abode’. This is due to a severe shortage of Local Authority permanent and transit sites. A large number of Gypsies and Travellers still work in traditional trades which involve travelling around the country for work, with such a lack of Local Authority transit sites many workers and their families are forced to camp illegally whilst carrying out work in an area, areas which their families would have been travelling and working in for hundreds of years.

That's how they define themselves.

&gt;It's also interesting how much you are working to try to put words into your mouth. 

I'm putting words in my mouth?  That's called speaking.

&gt;I've noticed this a lot - why is it that you're so scared to debate what I actually say, rather than trying to make up what you think I'm saying?

When did I do that?  That's a specific accusation.  I never put words in your mouth, I gave an example of why it's problematic to allow prejudiced people to freely define their terms by taking that idea to its logical conclusion.  That's not the same as accusing you of saying these things, and I hope you don't think that before I was accusing you of being an anti-semite or anti-black person. On the contrary, my whole argument rests on the assumption that we will both find these things distasteful.

The first comment on that article summarises my opinion very well

&gt; Because DEFENCE is not the same as ATTACK. The military provides jobs and skills for British people, provides business for companies, and promotes trade in products. 

It it my understanding that the proposed increase in military funding did not take the costs of Afghanistan into account. By pulling the UK out of all foreign engagements, and stopping any chance of future possibilities of conflict, like Syria nearly turned into, a lot of money is suddenly not being spent. This means that the 40% increase proposed would still be less than the current spending. Having a large, strong territorial army is important. As we've seen in Ukraine, things can go from calm to disaster very quickly, and we need to be prepared. Not having a competent military is not something that a leading NATO nation like the UK responsible for 60 million people can risk. Also, those figures were from the 2010 manifesto which is now mostly irrelevant (especially the part about Nukes which I am sure will be revised)

**Environment**  

The article you linked is from March 2013, and the link to UKIP's official energy policy document (published september 2012) is no longer working.  I suspect a lot of things have changed since then, so I will not try and argue for what has been said. What is for certain is their support for nuclear power. It is the most viable alternative energy available now, and blows windfarms out of the water. I'm not sure how much you know about nuclear power - some people still don't know that it is just steam coming out of the towers, not radioactive gas - [but here is a good fact sheet on the benefits of it nonetheless](http://www.nei.org/Master-Document-Folder/Backgrounders/Fact-Sheets/Quick-Facts-Nuclear-Energy-In-America)

Most likely it wouldn't be an issue UKIP would focus on very hard at all. Abolishing the Human Rights Act is in response to the ECHR overriding sentences handed down by British courts, giving leaner sentences and sometimes getting rid of sentences. Obviously UKIP is going to want to stop this. It does not meant the UK will turn into a human right ignoring cesspit, but I think most people agree British judges should have overall say on what happens to our criminals. The article on multiculturalism is again from march 2013, and is based on the outdated 2010 manifesto. The 2015 one will be more moderate.

As UKIP is the only party tackling immigration, unfortunately the more extreme people are going to support them. You may not know that it is official UKIP policy to ban anyone who has been in the BNP or EDL from joining the party. Obviously some get through the cracks, as shown in your examples but they are always very quickly banned from the party. It's a downside of suddenly getting a surge in popularity and becoming more and more relevant, but they have to weed out the bad eggs somehow. The mistake people make is calling the whole party racist and xenophobic for the actions of a few. You wouldn't call all Muslims terrorists for the actions of a small %'age of Muslims, so you shouldn't do it to a political party either. Just as you wouldn't say all Tories are tax evaders,all Labour members are pedophiles and all Greens are Stalinists.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt;  Whether you like it or not religion, especially Islam and Christianity are going to be considered as important and formative for at least the next millenium.

I'm sure my ancestors, who were just in the process of giving up the Norse gods (mostly under threat of violence), thought likewise. 100-200 years later, they were mostly forgotten, other than as stories. 

These changes happens fast when they first happen. I'd argue that Christianity will be mostly gone in a century or a little more. It may hang on in cults, and may last a bit longer in some countries. Islam my hang in there a little bit longer, but I'd give it 200 years at most.

Consider that in large parts of Europe, for example, blasphemy was a serious crime until well into 20th century. In Norway, Life of Brian was banned in cinemas as blasphemy - the last movie to be banned on those grounds. When I started school in 1982, Christianity was taken seriously as an important subject in class, and I was seen as weird because my parents let me choose to be exempted. There was 5 of us total in the entire school that had asked to be exempted. 

This year there's been an uproar because the new conservative government had to horse-trade with the miniscule Christian-Democratic Party, and promise 55% christianity in the now-current subject that is a watered down course on religion and philosophy. In 1970, the abortion debate was still raging. Today, the conservative government just had to make a total u-turn over introducing the *possibility* for GP's to get exempted from referring women for abortion - another part of their horse-trading with the Christian-Democrats to get support in parliament - after both a public uproar and widespread opposition in their own parties as well.

In the 1970's a majority still believed in a literal hell. Now, there's frequent arguments whether or not a majority even believes in *a* God, and the answer depends on how wishy-washy your definition gets - the belief in a *personal* God is down to around 10%, while a ""God as a non-personal force and creator"" still probably is in the 60% range.

That's how much things can change in 40 years.

In the UK? Consider the case of Turing vs. todays situation with gay marriage.

Both of them are above us in the table.  At this time last season, Everton had 60 points and Liverpool had 55.  Those point totals would put them in 6th and 7th this season, with the table looking like this:

1. Chelsea 78pts (36 games played)
2. Man City 77 (35)

The fact that that Everton improved by 9 points (despite losing their longtime manager) and Liverpool improved by *25* points is why they are above us in the table.  Without those improvements, *we would be in 4th*, four points behind Arsenal, as the table above shows.

Your point on ManU is a fair one.  Their dropoff allows us to even have this conversation about being in 4th if the Merseyside clubs hadn't leapfrogged us.  However, many people (myself included) expected them to fall off after losing Ferguson.  I predicted that they'd be scrapping for 4th with us and Woolwich.

I had very supportive parents, so maybe I'd have ended up going, part-parent-funded - but I suspect that I'd have chosen to live at home, picking the nearest uni, rather than the best I could get into, or the one that seemed like the nicest place to study/live - so I could come out of it with reduced levels of debt.

But I may just have tried to skip the degree and find work - back then I may have managed to get into my chosen career (programming/game development) without a degree - as a self-taught programmer with decent A-levels, but it would have been a lot harder, even back then - and near-impossible today, a degree is pretty much expected.

Maybe taking a year out after A-levels - to try your luck in the job market and seriously consider options - would be a more sensible thing to do than follow the old assumption that passing GCSEs leads to A-levels, and passing A-levels leads to uni.

I'm not sure they will actually. Certainly if you look at trends over the past 10 years, rent hasn't risen by anywhere near the amount that house prices have. Furthermore, as the state pushes more people out of council-housing schemes onto the private rental sector there is a downward pressure on prices. I know in my own area that despite there being a lot of demand on rental houses, this house actually sat empty for 4 months waiting for tenants, and it was only when the landlord lowered the price by £100 a month than someone (me) snapped it up... the problem being that in a town with a lot of rental properties, despite the demand, tenants can vote with their feet for what they want, so properties need to stick within what people can afford slightly more than the wider market does.

For some it's tough to beat the conditioning and return to the default hence it feels like they are ""becoming"" atheist or making the choice that they ""believe there's no god"" rather than what they are actually doing: rejecting an idea that's been presented to them (or forced upon them in many cases).",0,1398621351,null,0,false,0,ch3fkwt,t3_243dwr,t1_ch3fkwt,t1_ch38pt8,null,1433545033,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Al_Bee,null,null,"Not voting UKIP but from what I can see it's a lot of angry people with no-one else to vote for.  Conservatives are UKIP-lite but not doing anything about the issues that UKIP focus on and their lying about what they'd do to the NHS before the last election before swiftly doing a 180 (as everyone else knew they would) and basically selling it off isn't really in their favour, and bigots can get off hating Cameron for the gay marriage thing; Labour are a pitiful farago of PR-trained identikit nobodies led by a weak and ineffectual leader, and their policies are nothing more than tweaks of the current lot; Lib-dems are pathetic back-stabbers who vote for things they said they wouldn't; Greens seem to have some decent policies but are weak and ineffectual and there's no hope of them getting any more power than maybe one MP (ah the wonders of FPTP).  So who do you vote for if you want a change?  Sadly the only answer for lots of people is a group of unknowns led by a shameless publicity whore who apparently says what he thinks and won't be dictated to by PR spods.  

    
Most potential UKIP voters don't have a clue about what the party would do for them beside some nebulous ""we don't like foreigners"".  What will they do with the NHS?  Save it or sell it more quickly than the cons will?  Their tax scheme makes absolutely no sense to anyone with any idea of fairness.  Their spending plans clearly don't fit with their taxation plans.  Their social services plans are either non-existant or more vile than the tories' (depending on who you listen to).  Their ideas for business basically is less red-tape which means stuff like you can be sacked for any reason at any time (potentially), perhaps weaker health and safety rules, perhaps weaker maternity protections etc.  The leader has suggested he may roll back the gay marriage thing.  They want to cut more from public spending than anyone else.

https://humanism.org.uk/campaigns/religion-and-belief-some-surveys-and-statistics/

Most other polls and surveys put it lower. 

The BHA poll found 65% ""non religious"" while the Guardian found 63% ""non religious"" but ""non religious"" does not necessarily equate with an actual disbelief in a god, it can indicate they don't subscribe to organised religion, don't go to church regularly, or simply that religion isn't particularly important to their lives. The Guardian poll for example asked if people would describe themselves as ""a religious person"" - if you sort of believe but don't take it terribly seriously I don't think you would answer ""yes"" to that one. 

Just as ticking ""Christian"" in the census doesn't equate to belief in a god due to cultural Christianity, so it is the other way around. ""Not a religious person"" does not equate with disbelief in God. You might note that in both BHA and Guardian surveys half of people who self-identified as Christian *in the same poll* described themselves as ""not a religious person"". I suspect many of these are believers but it's just not a big part of their lives. 

If you want to deal with the actual question of belief/disbelief in a god I think the Eurobarometer poll is the best source for that as it is the only one I've found that actually asks the question. And that finds 37% believers, 25% atheists and the rest in some wishy-washy space in between where they believe in ""something"" supernatural but not necessarily ""God"".

Ironically, the last time i felt like this was probably the 4-4 Chelsea v Liverpool Quarter Final of the Champions league in '09 where we lost it 7-5 on aggregate after coming back not once, but twice to almost win it. After that would have been the CL final in Athens against AC in '07.

I feel heartbroken, and it's not even over yet! It's just the nature of the loss. Stevie mistake; José's fucking mind games; The time wasting from the FIRST MINUTE then parking a fucking ocean liner to try and see the game out. Absolutely devastating.

Brighton may be a bit unique due to location but certainly there's so many great independent shops that exist that I find it hard to believe there's not similar drive/desire elsewhere.

Making it more affordable to small businesses for one and encouraging them as DrBibby mentions seems like a great way. I think the reason Brighton can afford to do it is tourism which makes it less risky - if there's not this then I think you'll need to subsidise empty space for the meantime or at least reduce rates to reduce the risk.  

The diversity of shops is also important I think - it's not good just having the same thing but with a different name next to each other - the reason I enjoy shopping here is because there's always something a bit random which will catch my eye.

The goalposts have changed so that nowadays you need a degree as a baseline requirement for jobs that previously didn't previously require it like accountancy and nursing. You'll find that you need a degree to even get past the first HR hurdle and even that doesn't guarantee you a job, let alone a good one: even most internships look for graduates. 

So I would say that even if a degree doesn't bring you a well-paying job, you've still got more doors open to you than those without a degree.

I would advise picking a degree subject that has a good chance of landing you a job afterwards and basically beware the arts, humanities and social sciences unless you're so interested in the topic you think it's worth paying £27k to learn more about it.

true,TheNoodlePoodle,null,null,"&gt; I'd much rather invest in indexes (as they should practically never go down right?)

No. The difference between investing and saving is that you are accepting some risk (namely that the capital value will go down) in exchange for a higher profit. On average, over the long term, it appears that the returns you get from stocks will be higher than what you get from cash (this is called the ""risk premium"") but no-one will guarantee that for you. Think carefully about this - most people can handle some risk in their life, but only you know how much, and this is probably the biggest thing to consider when choosing investments.

The only free lunch in investing is diversification. There are two key ways you can diversify, and you should consider both:

* What you invest in
* When you invest in it

If you invest in several unrelated indexes, and spread your investments over a period of time (i.e. adding a bit each month), then the chances of all of those investments failing is reduced.

The EU's work permit is similar to the United States' ""Green Card"" program, called the ""Blue Card"". There are also 100's of non-EU migrants/refugees stuck in Calais, [""desperate to stow away on lorries bound for the UK.""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26728692) So, I don't see what you're getting at?

true,E_mE,eu,"Berlin, DE","&gt; Libertarian = Individuals own everything.

Wrong - It as there term states, a person who advocates civil liberty. Ownership has nothing to do with Libertarianism. Libertarianism covers all people's right to do as they wish, long as it doesn't harm or allow individuals to gain power over others. All people would treated equally regardless, which UKIP appear to have a problem with. So the fact that UKIP calls them self Libertarian is quite a joke really. 

&gt; Socialism = Government/elected body owns everything.

Wrong here too, Government is a form of Statism, which socialism doesn't need to adhere too. Yes the Soviet Union did, but if you look at the works of Rosa Luxembourg and other socialist thinkers, you will see there where many criticism of Leninism. For one, Lenin removed democracy from the work place which invalidated the Socialist idea.

To quote ""Socialism is a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole."" Socialism does not require a state or centralised system to sustain it, that is where the Libertarian side comes in.

Libertarian Socialism merely means having your civil liberty while maintaining responsibility for society, the environment and the community as a whole, instead of being a selfish individualist who wants to take power from others or create hierarchies for their own self desires. Removing hierarchy and unnecessary power structures and replace it with full collective control is the only non-totalarian mechanism that currently exists.

Now regarding your Electricity board idea, this would be run by the workers of the electric board through a direct democracy in the work place and owned by everyone in the community. No individual or small group of people have the theoretical right to ownership of an essential service which benefits the whole. All resources would be shared to the community and no power hierarchy would exist.  If someone didn't want to work in the Electric board no more, they could quit without having the suffer the consequences of going hungry or homeless.

When has GCHQ ever done any spying on pedophiles anyway? 

Can you link me 1 single case where their information has led to the conviction of a child abuser?

The police investigate child abuse, not the intelligence service... That means undercover work, infiltrating groups and finding out where they live. 

There's a reason why GCHQ went with the pedophile angle: they know that the average voter will eat it right up, despite it being nothing to do with their job. Their job is to spy on people, not to protect the children. Child abuse is not a national security issue.

true,ZombieWomble,null,null,"Oh, catch yourself on. Do you genuinely think I was *apologising* for the UVF up there? I was trying to present a bit of a description of the historical context and explain how Unionist groups can have a self-consistent metric for which groups are acceptable to commemorate (i.e. ""This group killed civilians"" vs ""This group did not""). I tried to present one sides point of view rather than go straight for the ""They're all as bad as the others!"" line, since I thought you might have been seeking an actual discussion on the context, rather than an echo chamber.

But, it seems I forgot to go through the forms which are required to not be accused of taking sides. Thus, I'll add the following disclaimers here, for future reference: I deplore the introduction of violence (both threatened and actual) into Irish politics. I do not believe the metric I describe above, used by some Unionists to distinguish between the IRA and UVF, is particularly meaningful as it's largely down to political concessions that the UVF did not end up in similar violent struggles as nationalists. I believe that many of the commemorations of ""historical"" groups are nowhere near good enough at distancing and disavowng contemporary paramilitaries, and a case could be made for restricting them, until they are better separated from contemporary identity politics. Both nationalist and unionist factions did terrible things before and during the Troubles, and neither can claim anything like a moral high ground at this point.

Right - which is why you're blindly accusing me of it so that you can dismiss my points as racist when they clearly are not.

&gt; The things you are saying about gypsies and travellers are caricatured fallacies and you're applying them to a whole ethnic minority. That is racism.

No it's not.

I only have a problem with the Romani gypsy culture.  Those that are ethnically Romani but don't follow the Romani gypsy culture I have absolutely no problem with.  So it's clearly not rascism.  If I have accidentally said anything bad about all ethnic Romani, point it out and I'll correct it and apologise for that usage.

""Ethnicity"" is an extremely loosely defined term.  Wikipedia defines it as:

&gt; Membership of an ethnic group tends to be associated with shared cultural heritage, ancestry, history, homeland, language (dialect), or ideology, and with symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, physical appearance, etc

So Nazis would seem to be an ethnicity under this definition.  Since they share an ideology.  So are you saying that if anyone hates nazis then they are therefore racist?

This is where we differ, and the heart of the complaints about a London-centric UK. The concept that we have to limit investment to London just because of increased profitability depends on the idea that all the money spent in London is getting the same return. Some gets a great return, a lot doesn't. 

We could also quite easily transfer money saved from the long-awaited returns from the loans to the banks after 2008 or the lost taxes owed from various major companies in order to fund development elsewhere in the country.  Of course, this won't happen because the people who owe the money are making under the table deals to avoid paying it, all in the name of supporting London.

To put in perspective,  I easily saved upto £500 per month even on my starting engineering salary of 21k. That money sat in my savings account not really doing much but it gave me a very comfortable safety net. You could save a lot of money if you're smart about your renting situation (e.g. sharing with housemates,  splitting rent, utilities etc. equally or if you're lucky, an all inclusive deal).

Now that I've bought a house, a fair chunk of my salary goes into repaying the mortgage, my utilities and also various maintenance costs. All that becomes your responsibility as the owner. I've suspended my regular saver accounts for the last 12 months to allow my current account re stabilise. I even rented out one of my spare rooms which helps a lot, but you will still feel that hit on your bank account for at least 6 months after you get your keys. I plan to live here for many years so the I have committed myself to the investment.

I guess my advice is this. Renting is good if you haven't decided where to settle yet and lack capital for the mortgage deposit.

Same can be said about Stevie. He wanted to make up for his mistake with a screamer. Instead he should just keep to his role and spray passes around the field.

Allen and Lucas looked more like team players today. All though Lucas didn't play well, at least he tried to follow some sort of pattern. Allen looked good and actually worked his ass off, trying to fill the gap from Hendo.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; The opinion polls mask the passion in the leave and the tepidness of the stay.

Do they? I'm inclined to argue it suggests the apathy of people of support status quo, and the enthusiasm of people who want change. This is something you see across many issues, but when push come to shove, I'd expect the people who support the EU to become more passionate. With the rise of UKIP, anti-EU sentiment in the polls has actually gone down, with 2014 marking the first time in a while where the number of people supporting staying in the EU outnumber the people who support leaving.


&gt; The idea of its either in or out is part of the political elites absolute refusal to look at what democratic mandate there is for what amount of political integration.

UKIP are the ones who want a straight 'In or Out' referendum, whereas the other parties are suggesting negotiation first. If anything, what you are talking about is more of a criticism of UKIP than the 'political elites', as they are making the issue black and white, In or Out.

true,Unlinkedhorizonzero,,Belfast,"Amidst outrage from Loyalists and Protestants, Paisley and Robinson set up a paramilitary group called Ulster Resistance which linked up with the two major Loyalist groups, the Ulster Defence Association (estimated to have killed at least 300 people in the Troubles) and the UVF (death toll, at least 480). In its very first action, an armed group of Ulster Resistance members crossed the Border and invaded Clontibret in Co. Monaghan. Shots were fired but the group, with one exception, fled when the Irish police arrived on the scene. The sole Ulster Resistance member left behind was Peter Robinson who was arrested and charged. He later pleaded guilty to taking part in an unlawful assembly.

Ulster Resistance’s claim to fame, or infamy, came when French police arrested some of it leaders in a Paris hotel as they were negotiating a second arms deal with representatives of the apartheid government in South Africa. Using its extensive contacts in Shorts missile factory in East Belfast, Ulster Resistance had already traded missile secrets for weapons and grenades. The latter were used in Michael Stone’s famous attack on IRA mourners in a West Belfast cemetery in 1988 which killed three people. The second deal apparently involved passing over details of Shorts Blowpipe missile system, weaons that were at the centre of the Iran-Contra scandal.

The general public aren't *that* stupid, they are just tired of the same old same old. Labour like to peddle public projects to generate jobs and the Conservatives like to peddle austerity measures to consolidate while giving small breaks here and there to businesses.

Now UKIP are here being complete outsiders claiming a new route that neither Labour nor the Conservatives want. They want to stiffer immigration from the EU.

Looking at the UK, unemployment is higher than we would all like assuming the figures are not ""massaged"" it is at 6.9%. The jobs aren't out there and the recovery has been very up and down since the recession started. 

There is an air of uncertainty, Labour led us into these troubles and some of people are slow to forget bullshit like [this](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8688470.stm) now the Conservatives won the election after them but there was no great or even steady recovery, yet there were job cuts and real hurt caused. The Lib Dems are unfortunate enough to be caught up in the ""failure"" of the conservatives to be able to fix the economy like everyone would like by being a part of the coalition government without having all that much power, though they did manage to block the Tories increasing the inheritance threshold but I am afraid that doesn't win many votes now.

What I think this is showing is the fact that everyone feels Labour led them into the troubles, the Conservatives and Lib Dems combined were unable to do much more than flounder in the right general direction. They want someone new with a new way of thinking.

However, unless you have £325,000 sat around to buy the house outright there is no alternative... well, there is an alternative: rent and own nothing at the end. Give 100% of your money away to someone else, when you could just give 2.25% away for 2 years, then the variable rate after that.  And given that property prices rose by faster than the interest rates on their repayments this year - and historically for the past 40 years have generally increased in value faster than interest (bar a few blips) so even taking interest into account you still make money over the 25 year repayment... 

**Tl:dr:** You are making the case that borrowing £325,000 means paying back about £475,000 after 25 years. BUT... after 25 years its likely the house will be worth **more** than £475,000 if the last 40-50 years are anything to go by, together with UK population trends. If you rent, you lose 100% of what you put in. **There are plenty of good arguments for renting, but this isn't one of them.**

I don't agree. Margaret Thatcher was a huge fan of Churchill. 

Once, a long time ago, I was working at the House of Commons Library and Margaret Thatcher came in. This was just after she stopped being PM. She asked me for 4 of Churchill's books, from memory History of the English-speaking People was one of them.

Well only 2 were to hand. See the problem with the HC Library is we don't really have any clout over our customers. If they want to walk off with the books it's hard to stop them - it's not like a Uni where we can say we won't give them their degree until they bring their library books back.

So I did what any sensible front line worker does in a crisis - I delegated upwards. I settled Mrs T at a comfortable desk with the 2 books that were available, asked her to bear with us while we got her the other 2 books she wanted. She was actually extremely charming.

Meanwhile my senior had done what any sensible worker does in a crisis. She delegated upwards.

After a while the books arrived. It turned out that once the problem had been delegated up as far as the Librarian of the House of Commons, a very grand man indeed, he was able to solve it. It happened we had a signed first edition of one which the Librarian kept locked up in his safe. The other we borrowed from the Library of what is known in Westminster as ""the other place."" (The House of Lords Library down the corridor from us).

Best of luck with the interview and feel free to mention that when you asked reddit you got a response from someone who had once served Mrs Thatcher in the House of Commons Library.

For those of you who haven't been following the news lately: Lenny Henry has been making activist statements to the media about demanding more black and ethnic minority actors on the BBC.

In all honesty one would probably view Lenny Henry as a raving racist - how he got away with the comments he made at the Queen's Jubilee Concert I'll *never* know - any white person saying those sorts of things would have been imprisoned.

And here we have a white guy respond and suggest how Lenny Henry might be happier given his provocative racist statements. Unfortunately the white guy is labeled the racist in this situation.

It is time the UK ceased the double standard of encouraging racism in certain races and being intolerant of it in others. What a man says should not have a different interpretation because of his skin colour - as it does today in the United Kingdom.

As it is I don't know why Lenny Henry is thinking certain races are under-represented on television. Judging by the adverts on television one would never think that [the UK is only 3% black (Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_the_United_Kingdom#Census_ethnicity_results) - a foreigner watching British advertising might be convinced the number is higher - 30-50% maybe more!",0,1398633172,null,0,false,0,ch3kshn,t3_244d5q,t1_ch3kshn,t3_244d5q,null,1433547553,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It doesn't. A better question would be - why do you think the UK should be immune to the world's problems?

The following is taken from the UNHCR web site in response to a similar question:

&gt; **Does the UK have more asylum seekers than most countries?**

&gt; No it does not. With an estimated 70,400 asylum applications, the United States of America was the largest recipient of new asylum claims in 2012, accounting for 8% of all individual applications worldwide. Germany was second with 64,500 asylum applications, followed by South Africa (61,500), France (55,100), and Sweden (43,900). By comparison, the UK received 23,499 new applications for asylum in the year ending June 2013. 

If you really want to see a country that ""gets stuck with the world problems"", then you may want to consider Jordan. Not only does it have refugee camps from old conflicts in Iraq, Israel and Lebanon, but it now has to deal with refugees from Syria.

Gnosticism is indeed the the name of belief system, see here http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/d8/ec/c0/d8ecc07e906127bf0fd4623504b7eca8.jpg

However it is also the term for a more general description of inner relevation and applies to other faiths (many of the early christian texts are known as the Gnostic gospels) 

A a prefix on a word doesn't really mean the opposite, it is closer to mean 'without' consider 'apolitical'.

Theist is someone who believes in a god (or gods). If you lack such a belief, no matter how convinced or not you are then you are a type of atheist. It doesn't matter how sure, how much knowledge you claim to be the reason you lack such a belief.

He was the kind of kid at school who was never particularly good with girls but hung out with a sporty lot, and whilst never quite having the ability to make it in the sport he loved, he could still make a career out of it.

Despite him not really making much money off it and nor will he ever, it comes with the added perk of giving him the moral high ground he's craved for years and so he lauds it over us whenever he can.

I wonder what the people on Blue Moon would think of him if they knew he called a young lad out on here to fight!

3 - José Mourinho - His tactical analysis of the games is simply superb. Against the top-flight teams this year he managed to get 16 points out of 18. Assisted by a bit of luck (on Gerrard error pahaha), which balances with the unlucky game of last weekend, in which he ended his home record in Blues, in the second half he once again defended extremely well - or “parked the bus” if you don’t like his strategy - demonstrating deep understanding of the game.

2 - Ivanovic - He returned in his original role and behaved like a wall, closing every space and leaving Suarez almost no chances. The best today.

1 -  Azpilicueta - José today tested the defensive line which will play against Atlético Madrid. And it’s clear that Azpilicueta will fit magnificently on the right - his natural role. He closed every attempt Sterling tried. 

1 - Matic - Potentially, he can become the future Chelsea column. He has everything: the physical strength, the wisdom and the technique of a top-class midfielder.
 
1 -  Schurrle - Great match, he was the most dangerous Blues and went very close to the 2-0 in a couple of circumstances.

I know there have been many individual actions this season that could cost us the league (Kolo's mistake e.g.), that's just the way football works.
But when I was watching City against Sunderland, obviously very delighted that Sunderland were leading 1-2, the minute I saw that howler from Mannone, I had this feeling ""holy fuck, this stupid howler from a keeper we have nothing to do with is going to cost us the league eventually"".

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Indeed. As I said, the OP will find the problem with buying isn't the monthly repayments - it's the deposit, unless they have access to a generous individual. Essentially if you can save for a deposit, you can afford the monthly repayments. 

My main point here is that the cost of renting is broadly in line with the cost of buying. A more typical starter home would be around £200K (but the OP is in Brighton which has quite a specific market, where £200K won't buy very much.) At £200-250K you would be looking at repayments on/or slightly below what most people pay to rent. BUT in order to access that you would need a sizable lump of cash to put down a deposit. 

My second point is that first time buyers need to be very careful to consider the interest rates on their repayments. Although it doesn't look like it'll happen anytime soon, 25 years is a long time... it's fair to say that within 25 years interest rates **will** go up. Infact it will probably start happening next year. An increase to the base rate of even 2% would add several hundred each month to the repayments. So anyone buying a house should not be doing it at the limit of their affordability.

My guess is, the BoE might actually increase the base rate to 1% by the end of this year - simply to send a warning shot to people with mortgages not to overstretch themselves. It will also signal to the market that the BoE won't tolerate overheating in the market with above inflation rises of 8-10% being absurd.

Morrisons for rice cakes. Can't find the receipt but they were under £1.50.

true,threesquares,null,null,"I live in north Essex and work on Saturday nights at one of my local pubs. I live in quite a touristy area and there are now four local pubs in my village, plus two members-only clubs with bars. 

In my pub, the focus definitely seems to be moving more towards food than wet sales. My pub does pretty much everything - b'n'b, restaurant, bar, events, and on the nights I work it's definitely getting quieter on drink sales and busier on food service. They were REALLY busy over the bank holiday weekend, and I think the total was just over a thousand meals served in four days. 

The landlords do put effort into making sure we have a good drink selection and they've introduced a loyalty card scheme now so the regulars get something like 10% off everything, which is going down pretty well from what I've seen. We definitely get less of the going-out crowd and binge drinkers, but my village is quite insular and people often go out on random pub crawls, so sometimes we'll be crazy busy with drinkers until half twelve and other times it'll be so dead that we're all cleaned up by 11 o'clock. It's really hard to pin it down, but in general it seems to be moving much more towards house parties and the occasional lairy weekend than going out regularly. 

One central pub in my village closed last year - but to be honest, no one really misses it. It was a total, total dive with a lot of the rougher sort going, and whoever takes it over next is going to have a tough time of it reopening as anything half decent again. The pub/restaurant down the road from us do very well out of their live folk music nights, and the pub on the other side of the village tends to cater more for the cheaper binge drinkers - I hear them coming past my window at 2/3am most weekends. 

The nearest town *seems* to be pretty constant in its choice of pubs and bars - I think a few have changed hands, but they're mostly the wine bar sort anyway. I don't like going to town drinking anyway, so I can't much comment on that side of it.

I haven't really noticed any change in the local community, no. A few sighs of relief that the Hart closed perhaps. We rely a lot generally on the tourist trade, so as long as the summers stay good, then I think places round here will keep afloat for a while longer.

true,ZFree2013,null,null,"&gt;do you think Brendan could have set-up differently?

I think our biggest issue was a complete lack of a plan B. I assume the intention was, that Suarez or another player would bag us a goal in the first twenty minutes, and then Chelsea would be forced out thus leaving them exposed.

However unfortunately a cataclysmic error at the approach of half time happened, and that moment wrote the game really, as once Chelsea were a goal up, they would continue to do what they had done in the first half, but with even more intensity now. 

We effectively played a mirror image of Atletico Madrid where eventually the team started fragmenting off and mentally we were broken. Gerrard came out clearly effected, and balls were just hit and hope, which does not really suit Suarez, as he is more of a ball to feet player, but when one of your main passers in Gerrard has gone off the boil, Suarez loses those killer passes. 

If anything, today showed exactly what Gerrard does for this team week in week out, Another day he Whips a long ball across the field to Suarez on the flank and we score, and Suarez is applauded. Another day Salaha is through on goal 1 on 1 with only Gerrard to save us, and he launches in with his precise tackles and reading of the game.

So once the mentality had left our most experienced player, we ended up with 45 minutes of us having to play very direct football against an eleven man defence, and today we lacked that key to unlock the door. 

I am not sure if we could have made Chelsea attack though, It depends mostly on if they would have really done much in attack. Their team was clearly out to frustrate us, so they probably would  have passed it around and drawn us out, which might have allowed us more room I guess, but might have left them room too, but I suppose we wont know now. I do agree with you mostly though, and for me, Brendan was naive, He assumed we could just go out and blitz them for a goal or two, yet we all knew Chelsea would come to frustrate us, So like you say, Maybe we should have played for a stale mate rather than a check mate, and played them at their own game, because a draw today was so much better than a loss, but Brendan took a chance to stick to what he knows and we ended up paying for it.

What annoys me as well, Is if we had done what you said, we might have even won barring Gerrard's mistake because we know Chelsea's strikers are fairly inconsistent unless 1v1. 

Its difficult for Brendan though as he clearly wants to play good attacking football, not souless park the bus football, and its nice to stick to your philosophy, but the problem is, the winner writes the history, so Chelsea wont be remembered for playing like that, they will be remembered for playing tactical master classes. I mean not being funny, but you would actually think Mourninho invented the park the bus tactic the way neutral journo's and media people are orgasming over it. 

Anyway, In my opinion one of our main undoing's with the way we did play today was wasting set pieces like corners for example, if you know the other team is better in the air, play it short to Suarez and let him run in the box and work his magic, the problem is a lot of our play would have suited a player like Benteke or Andy Carrol, or a Mario Gomez, but not a Suarez or Coutiniho or Sterling who are small nimble players, who find more luck with their skill and dribbling when running at defenders, drawing tackles and dancing into the box, but obviously with eleven players are behind a ball, you cant take on three defenders and get clear on goal, so we were looking at having to smash them long and from outside, which is where we needed a striker like mandzukic for example to bring on who could have an Ariel presence in the box, if we really want to cross them. 

But at the end of the day, The way we played today, was not inherently bad, its got us to this point this season, a lot of bad luck is what did us today, not 7 at the back Chelsea. Yellow cards should have been given for time wasting in the first half, more time should have been given and yet we did not receive that luck today , and we did have chances, lets not forget that. Tomorrow the papers will laud Moanriniho as a tactical master, the greatest, the best, the man who came and stopped Liverpool in their tracks, but we did have chances, Suarez buries that corner, its a different game, we were not humiliated here, but rather frustrated, Another day Gerrard does not make that mistake, next half we draw them out more and pick them off. 

So for me, I don't think *much* could have been changed today for a guaranteed result for us, The only thing I would look at is  mentalities. Its a bit like the UFC, some fighters will try to tie up very offensive opponents by crawling all over them for three/five rounds, and its down to the mentality of that fighter not to become frustrated and lose focus, which is exactly what we did today, if you are going to be the offensive player or team, then you have to make sure you keep concentrated on your job. 

But it is what it is, Chelsea may have done us today, but one day they will lose against us, hopefully Champions League Final next year, and Brendan can run and do that stupid brave heart scream. At the end of the day, this is still a club being built, so if this season is anything to go by, next season shall be beautiful. 

Thats my totally arm chair manager view anyway :).

It was easy to get a job, it may have not been the job you wanted but it was a job. I had a summer job in a factory every summer (they used to call my parents to ask if I was coming back). Consequently I had more money when I graduated than when I started. My situation wasn't unusual, most of my contemporaries did the same. 
Some signed-on, you could get benefits during holidays. I tried it myself one Easter, when I was interviewed they asked if I would work, of course I replied. I went for an interview that afternoon and spent the next 3 weeks testing concrete. That was the job climate.

Having a degree was a door-opener when job seeking, I switched to IT for a job and rode the rise in IT work until the end of the century. I think that aspect has gone, there is nothing special about having a degree today, unless it is from a top university. 

So, would I do it again today? Probably not unless I could get a degree in something with a strong vocational aspect and also well paid. In other words the things competition makes it really difficult to get into. If you cannot do that then why do it?

For the most part though people are very helpful, don't hesitate to knock on a door to ask for directions or at farms if you're unsure if it's OK to cross a field.  For the most part the outdoor access code is common sense, don't trapse through someones garden or a field in sow (you can still cross them, just use the edges), close gates properly etc.  It's also not the case that access will be made particularly easy, and there are still a few confused landowners around who believe they can restrict all access to their land.

true,ChristheGreek,lfc68,null,"I have doubted a lot of decisions that Brendan has made this season only to end up being proven totally wrong, so I've pretty much adopted the 'In Brendan We Trust' mantra at this point. His thinking was probably that the football we have been playing has won us the last 11 games, so why should we change that?

Keep in mind, we played fine the first half. We tried to take the game to Chelsea, and while we didn't provide much of an attacking threat, we weren't really troubled defensively either.  I was happy going into stoppage time in the first half with the knowledge that ultimately a draw was still a great result, and that the more time that elapsed, the more Chelsea would have to come out of their defensive shape to try and score.  

However, the perfect storm happened for Mourinho.  Gerrard slipped and they got a freak goal.  The circumstances really couldn't have been any better for Mourinho, as now he could continue with his defensive strategy, and it was always going to be difficult to score against Chelsea. I thought the best opportunity we would have to score against them in the second half would have to be a set piece, or to earn a penalty. However, Chelsea was very good at stopping us from getting into their penalty box.

Coutinho was poor today, but he was always going to have a hard time picking out a pass with Chelsea playing so narrowly and so deep. He was clearly exhausted with 20 minutes left, but our lack of depth was exposed, and Brendan didn't really have an option on the bench to take him off for with us chasing the game. 

Also, and I noticed this in the Norwich match, our balance in midfield has been off since Henderson has been suspended and we've had to play Lucas ahead of Gerrard. Lucas is a great defensive midfielder, but he's just not suited to play further forward, and it was pretty evident on a couple of occasions. I suppose Rodgers didn't want to upset the apple cart and move Gerrard forward since he has been excelling as a deep lying playmaker. 

**Final notes:** Obviously us Liverpool fans have to be absolutely made up with how the team has done this season.  Not only are we directly qualified for the Champions League, but we did it with 3 games to spare. Unbelievable.  I can't speak for anyone else, but with how bad things have been for Liverpool since Xabi Alonso left ('bad' is relative of course), I have tried not to get as emotionally invested or have high expectations. The elation is fantastic when things are going well, but the pain is just too much when things go poorly. However, this team made it impossible not to dream of winning the title the past couple weeks.  I think all of us wanted it for Stevie more than ourselves, because no one deserves it more. So seeing him slip and be responsible for Chelsea's goal was gutting. I don't think I'm alone in saying I felt physically ill, not for myself, but because of how bad Stevie must be hurting. The nature of the defeat was so poetically cruel that it's at Shakespearian tragedy levels.

&gt;__Offa__ was King of [Mercia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercia), a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 757 until his death in July 796. The son of [Thingfrith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thingfrith) and a descendant of [Eowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eowa_of_Mercia), Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of [Æthelbald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86thelbald_of_Mercia). Offa defeated the other claimant, [Beornred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beornred_of_Mercia). In the early years of Offa's reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of midland peoples such as the [Hwicce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwicce) and the [Magonsæte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magons%C3%A6te). Taking advantage of instability in the [kingdom of Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kent) to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled [Sussex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sussex) by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory. In the 780s he extended [Mercian supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercian_Supremacy) over most of southern England, allying with [Beorhtric of Wessex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beorhtric_of_Wessex), who married Offa's daughter [Eadburh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadburh), and regained complete control of the southeast. He also became the overlord of [East Anglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_East_Angles) and had King [Æthelberht II of East Anglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86thelberht_II_of_East_Anglia) beheaded in 794, perhaps for rebelling against him.

Moving from agnosticism about evidence to a positive argument from evidence is a clever rhetorical slight of hand, but its what it is. You can't cast all of economics into doubt, then argue to a particular view of economics. Yet, that is essentially what this is doing.

Labour sucks and at the moment I feel like they're a broken record continually whining about how bad Bedroom Tax and NHS cuts are when everybody has heard it all before 100,000 times already. At first I thought it was the media trying to bully Labour because David Miliband didn't become the leader but now I have to agree... Ed Miliband has no spine. I actually miss Gordon Brown because he was *good* at his job. The media just didn't like him because he was unelected and he didn't have the charisma Tony Blair nor David Cameron had (and look where those prime ministers have led us.)

The Liberal Democrats screwed their main support-base over after agreeing with a vast majority of Conservative policies, even when they entirely contradicted Liberal ones. Nick Clegg's abilities have weakened considerably since 2010 and you could easily tell that in the recent Europe debates against Nigel Farage.

As for other parties? No. Just no. UKIP seems to have the press support and are poised to become the third party at least, plus with Clegg having fucked over his main support base and shown how weak he is debating with Farage, I foresee the Lib Dems losing a major amount of seats once the next election hits and UKIP becoming the third, if not the second party.

IS the biggest elephant in the room that modern British liberalism faces (which expands well beyond the the liberal party, indeed it is the predominant ideology of the country).

What makes them such a powerful case study in this, is that integration efforts here have always been very poor. 

Problem with travellers and Roma essentially is they occupy a grey area where in effect they are outside of much of the de facto application of many laws. 

A lot do not abuse that, some however do. Any numbers here barring some ground breaking new study are going to be bullshit. 

Fundamentally though it rubs people the wrong way, its not 'fair' after all, to have people treated differently on the basis of 'this is my culture' as we all on some level know, we can all just say that. What makes a culture I just invent with my mates, more or less 'real' than traveller culture, age and number of adherents? So over time and in gaining adherents would my fabrication become as real? Seems to follow that it would, thus turning that the other way it looks like culture is a fairly empty thing. 

So in essence, much of the incredibly anti-social behaviour committed by some few, is no more than that, anti-social behaviour, and sooner or later the idea that is a sacred cow, is going to have to go. 

Unfortunately, I think the only real solution is a firm return to the principle of 'the law is the law for everyone' (indeed, much as it might rub people the wrong way, there is a failure of a principle of equality before the law coming in here). 

And if that means certain 'cultural' aspects like constant movement and other things like horse racing being now permanently off the table. So be it.

There are the sort of pub that is focused on food, and has a small selection of beer, like the usual stella, strongbow, etc. 
Then there is the pub that's sort of half way between a real ale pub and a restaurant, selling traditional pub food like pies and fish and chips, but you can go in for a drink and it's all good.

 Then there are the real ale pubs that are somehow split between more hipster bars that sell real ales, and pubs that have been around for 150 years or so, are full of typical real ale drinkers (middle aged-old men with beards).

There are of course some exceptions, there are pubs that sell a huge array of ales and lagers, and still a couple of traditional local pubs, although they all seem to have developed an unfriendly atmosphere, and so I never go in.

true,MrOnigiri,lfc99,,"I think this loss is multi-factorial. It is not just because of the tactics we play or gerrard's unfortunate slip. 

1. Players. Our squad is not complete yet. I know our players have been fantastic this season but we really need better attacking fullbacks. We needed the width and the extra threat. Chelsea played so compact and crowded so many men in the middle. If we had fullbacks that can take men on, draw defence out and interplay on the wings, there might be more space for our strikers to exploit.


We need a better CM too. Lucas was one of our best players playing in the DM role for the past seasons but he looked slow, rigid and basically out of ideas in his new role. Now I'm not bashing him, I just think that he is just not suited for the box to box role currently in the middle. 


Henderson's red card and sturridge's injury mean that we just lost two of our first team players. Do we have players that can directly come in and replace them? 


Drawing comparisons with Chelsea's squad which by the way is worth a lot more than ours and a lot more depth, not to mention the number of players they send on loan too. They have more options to play with their tactics because they have players that can fulfill different roles. We're one year ahead of our plans, we will strengthen and we will eventually get the squad that we need to challenge on all fronts if given time and with good investments.


2. Tactics. This is mourinho's kind of game. It reminds me of inter vs barca. Arguably, barca '10 was one of the best sides the world has seen in recent years. Chelsea defended like a unit, crowded the middle and handled our dismal crosses and long shots. Not to mention that mourinho's plan to disrupt our plays and get into our players heads. They frustrated us with his tactics, time wasting from the start of the whistle. 


I'll also draw comparison to one of the greatest run of the invincibles of arsenal back when their blistering run of 49 unbeaten games ended at old trafford. We all know what happened that game. United wound arsenal up, stucked in and dodgy referee decisions. Different game, different teams but the idea is essentially the same. Get the team who is on form frustrated and make them mentally exhausted to be unable to focus entirely on the plays on the pitch. Get us to complain about wasting time, get us to make extra effort to run and reclaim balls out of bounds, surround the referee every decision, throw 10 players in their own half and miraculously capitalise on our one mistake. 


We were too naive. Rodgers was too naive. We knew they were going to park the blue bus and play on the counter. We did relatively well because we only really conceded from a counter for the 2nd goal while the whole game we worked tirelessly. We just don't have that cutting edge. The right runs, the right passes and the right shots. Instead, we resort to crosses and long shots. Did we win any of our comebacks with crosses and long shots this season? Is that how we've been playing whole season? Or were we patient, trying to work the ball, find space and get ourselves on dangerous positions that the opponents have to foul us? 


It's over. We lost. Now we look to the next game. We go again.",0,1398642573,null,0,false,0,ch3oxga,t3_244syh,t1_ch3oxga,t3_244syh,null,1433549502,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

There's no denying that the extremist end of reduced immigration policies attracts racists, and that's something UKIP are going to have to work out how to deal with. It's not a problem the Greens are ever likely to have to any great extent as extremist environmentalists are a lot more politically and socially acceptable (for good reason obviously!)

The problem for UKIP is that even if the party itself wants to reduce immigration for reasons that are totally fine and acceptable, there are a lot of extremists who feel *passionately* about those issues who are probably on balance more likely to put themselves forward as candidates.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Do the ends justify the means? I think this questions says a lot about what you one thinks is a moral act. One school of thought is that there are certain actions which one should never partake in: lying, murder and interfering in foreign countries affairs. The opposing school of thought is that any act, like the three listed above, can be justified and considered acceptable if they lead to an outcome which is holistically beneficial? Many people would say that killing one innocent person is never justified. However, the question becomes a lot more difficult if you have the option to kill one innocent person in order to save 100 other innocent lives. 

The Blair government seems to have had a largely 'ends justify the means'a approach to the war. They evaluated that Hussein was a violent dictator who was slaughtering his own people and had started two wars in the passed. They evaluated that he potentially had weapons of mass destruction. They evaluated the danger of Hussein to humanity and to the West at this point in time to be unreasonably high. They decided that an invasion of the country would cause the deaths of a lot of innocent people but would likely eliminate a huge amount of danger to an inconceivably greater number of people. The ends justified the means, from their perspective. 

Or you could just label them war-criminals, ignore their motivations for doing what they did and assume that they are the scum of the Earth for taking the decisions they did. Inaction can be just as amoral as bad action. Negligence is an important concept. If an international terrorist incident aimed at the West had come out of Iraq because the West didn't intervene and caused the deaths of thousands, would we blame our present and passed governments? Yes. Because inaction and negligence are real things that we judge people for. 

Do I disagree with what the Blair government did? Yes. Do I think they should have listened to the protests and backed down? Yes. However, they made the decisions they did with the information they had available, they consulted the [attorney general who informed them international law could be interpreted as making action legal](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/apr/28/uk.world3) and then they exercised one of the key prerogatives of government, which is to declare war.

Maybe international law should be changed and maybe we should have constitutional reform (well, we definitely should have constitutional reform, but on this specific issue?), but with the law and information that the Blair government was faced with, their actions were clearly not without logic and were clearly not totally without moral direction. We can disagree about the sanctity of any specific war or any specific action at any time, but I think that we shouldn't call each other war criminals when someone acts on what they believe to be right.

true,DorothyJMan,null,null,"Sell: Moses, Marin, Ba, Torres, Bertrand and Romeu. That's a good 25-30 million plus a whole heap of wages saved. If a good offer comes in for Mikel, let him leave if he wants.

Bring back Courtois, Lukaku, Piazon/T. Hazard and Zouma from loan, plus Chalobah if Mikel wants to go.

Sign on Terry, Lampard, Eto'o and Cole for another year. Plus Schwartzer if he wants.

That leaves us with a squad of:

**GK:** Courtois, Cech, Schwarzer/Hilario/Blackman

**DF** Azpi, Ivanovic, Terry, Cahill, Zouma, Kalas, Cole

**DM** Matic, Luiz, Van Ginkel, Ramires, Lampard, Chalobah/Mikel

**AM** Willian, Salah, Oscar, Piazon/T. Hazard, Hazard, Schurlle

**STR** Lukaku, Eto'o

This leaves us 2 positions needing vital improvements. LB and STR. In my opinion, Moreno and Costa suit us well and are very cheap given the alternatives (Cavani and Shaw, for example, would cost close to £100m). Moreno and Costa probably costs us around £50m.

Lastly, another option for CM is probably the last piece to complete José's puzzle. Although I'm a big fan of Ramires when he's on form, he's technically poor and a liability at times. Lampard is older, Luiz is good but not world class in midfield and Van Ginkel is as yet an unknown entity. Therefore I reckon a midfield partner for Matic would be perfect, and could be funded by the sale of one of Ramires or Luiz - preferably Ramires due to Luiz' versatility. Rake in maybe £20-25m for one of those 2 and put it towards Vidal (£40-45m) would be a dream. William Carvalho is a player I know nothing about but he's been bandied about on here for £20m or so, I guess he could be an option.

That leaves us with a net spend of around £40-50m. If money's tight, sell Mikel, get some hefty loan fees from Zouma/Kalas/Chalobah/Piazon/Thorgan/Bamford/Atsu - all good players who could play high tier football. If money's super tight, you don't sign Vidal, sell Ramires/Luiz and you have a net spend of next to nothing.

We went down immediately at the half after having dominated it. If we hadn't given up that goal no one would be talking about the lack of a plan B. There is no way to adapt to a team that just parks the bus. You just have to be better than that team. You nick a goal and then they go for the draw and then you nick another.

Most teams that park a bus do so because they aren't good. It's their best chance. Chelsea could easily play attacking football but they don't. They're a great team who play negative and benefit from it. Mourinho isn't where he is for no reason.

I've had my criticisms of Rodgers in his reign here, but anyone who is talking about a lack of a plan B is completely ignoring how the game went. If Chelsea didn't score before the half our approach would have been just the same. And say they score? What are we supposed to do once they've scored? The only real issue today was that Gerrard decided after the half to play like his old undisciplined self. It wasn't going to be easy to break their defense down, even he didn't waste shot after shot. But it would have gone a long way towards showing we were composed. Instead our leader lost his nerve.

I don't blame him for his mistake at the half. Those happen. I also can only feel for him. It's not like I've got as much invested in us winning as he does. I just think it's clear he was a big part of the problem. It's not like that means we go change anything. It just is a statement of fact.

Anyone pretending we should have played a different game from the start of the match is an idiot. Because if we did that in actuality and lost (just as likely as the loss today) you'd have said ""why would we change for Chelsea"". It's not about Rodgers being stubborn.

While we can identify ""black"" and ""white"" easily and make judgements accordingly, we can only identify a traveller by loud and obnoxious behaviour. (read: the very values we choose to judge ""them"" on) We're not allowed to irrationally hate ""blacks"" anymore so the media has diverted our attention to a darker threat (no pun intended)

Quiet, normal white folk who steal our jobs and unemployment benefits at the same time become invisible in the crowd.

And this is where racism lies. Even if every adult Roma person was scum, if every adult Roma person stole, swore and spat in faces and caused mayhem. Tomorrow's another's 18th birthday, and the new adult Roma might not be like the others, might not steal, may never swear and might if permitted become a valuable member of both communities changing the future.

She might be the only good person of any decent, and by judging her on the actions of others. Others who commit crimes not unlike those committed by people in all races at some point.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"The biggest failure of Iraq was an intelligence one not a moral one. Most of the information they had on hand was exaggerated, fabricated by corrupt sources or was placed into an exaggerated context which made it look worse and made them jump to conclusions. However if you believed it all then what we were facing was terrifying. Not many people will say war is wrong in all cases; most people will say we should intervene to stop genocide, some say we should protect innocent countries that get aggressively invaded. By any possible measure Saddam Hussain  would fall in any possible category you could make. He'd invaded Iran and tried to destroy Kuwait, he was guilty of genocide of the Kurds, the weapons he used against the Kurds were illegal chemical weapons that had been banned internationally for generations. In fact he committed a gas or nerve agent attack on military or civilians almost every year for 5 years from 1983 (14 in total) and probably once or twice after 1988, killing somewhere close to 30,000 people. The US and UK funded and supported a lot of the research that led to their development just FYI if you didn't feel like we had a dog in the fight from the start. Saddam had shown an interest before and after the First Gulf War of getting a nuclear weapon and had had a program in the 1970s, had actual parts for a nuclear centrifuge that were discovered hidden in the garden of Saddam's head physicist in 2003, the man who had ran his nuclear program during the cold war. He had blueprints for a complete centrifuge. Evidence that has come out since the war has shown that Iraq didn't fully destroy all of it's illegal weapons until not long before the 2003 war thinking their lies to UN inspectors had been discovered. The US didn't really know but it was only Iraq being over-cautious in the 90's that meant it didn't have WMDs in 2003. The US et al had never really believed Saddam had disarmed and even UN weapon inspectors said that Saddam had not accepted fully that he was to disarm. He sent out an order within Iraq saying that Iraqis did not have to abide by the UN. After 9/11 most of the middle east allied with the US and held fight terrorism. Iraq didn't and gave shelter to lots of the terrorists who (clearly after 9/11) posed a threat to the West. 

A lot of young people don't know or forget (myself included at one point) that we set up no-fly zones after the First Gulf War and continued to patrol Iraq from the end of the first war to the beginning of the second. We never really ended our confrontation with Saddam and Iraqi military instalments often tried to shoot down US/UK/FR aircraft as they patrolled Iraq. We were bombing Iraq for most of the very late 90's and early 2000s. 

The direct threat that Saddam posed to Western nations, the actual existence of WMDs and the interpretation of exaggerated intelligence as actual preparations for a nuclear bomb were all big failures and led to a war which probably wasn't justified by the arguments put forward. But although many people died in the conflict, I refuse to accept that the Iraqi people and especially the Kurdish people would be happier, safer or more prosperous under Saddam right now. The West would also have a large, major enemy in the middle east giving money, shelter and weapons to terrorists who wanted to recreate 9/11, while harbouring secret wishes to build a nuclear weapon with parts and missiles from North Korea. Saddam made sure he was our enemy from the first day of the first war and he never stopped trying to fight. I'm sure some people might accept that the Iraqi people now are better now than under the regime but would say 'that doesn't give us a reason to invade' which would be a fair point if your a pacifist. I'm not myself; I would say that if you accept intervention should happen sometimes, in the worst cases, then a dictatorial state like Iraq which committed genocide, used chemical weapons and biological weapons, breaching nuclear non-proliferation, sheltered terrorists, tortured citizens and killed many of them etc etc should be first on your list. Maybe we did do it all for oil but if so we stumbled into a really decent tactical decision to get rid of one of our most committed enemies and one of the most destabilising dictatorships in the world and accidentally saved the Kurdish population of Iraq from potential destruction.

The footage from about 12.50am to 1am shows the pair walking down Greenbank Avenue, stopping at the former Labour headquarters to commit the offence.

As a result, the exterior of the building and the pipework of the exterior have been damaged and repairs have been estimated to cost upwards of £10,000.

The vandals then continued down Greenbank Avenue and crossed a roundabout, heading in the direction of Tothill Park.

Mohamed Muganzi, centre director, said people arrived that morning to discover the fire had damaged sewage pipes and the wall.

As a result “raw sewerage was pouring into the street” said Mr Muganzi.
He added: “We went through the CCTV and saw the whole incident.
“Most of the materials on the wall that we used were imported from Poland so we’ve had to go back to them.

“I called the company and we’ve had to order new materials.

“The building work is still under warranty but this is not wear and tear. They estimated the cost of getting it back to normal to be between £5,000 and £10,000.

“We had to buy new pipes and pay for labour to fix the pipes. We can’t use the building if we don’t have working toilets.

“We got a local firm in to come and unblock the sewer and put in new pipes and we used a local plasterer to do some work. .

Firstly because I think that although parts of it are a farce, I trust the European parliament to look after people's interests over businesses more than Westminster so I have no desire to see powers returning there while the current lot are in charge (including Labour in that).

Secondly because I love that I can live and work in any part of the EU (I spent last year working in France).

Thirdly because I'm automatically sympathetic to anything the Daily Mail tells me to hate /s

However I don't trust federalists who want to form a super state or expansionists who think adding more states is automatically a good thing. I think a lot of these people are in love with an idea and not the realities of what a United States of Europe could look like, and too much expansion too fast is the core of a lot of people's problems with the EU. I'm happy(ish) with the EU that we have but not where it seems to be going. 

Edit: Also the Euro was obviously ridiculous but thankfully we've kept relatively clear of that mess.

2nd Edit: In regard to the whole ""led by Germany"" thing, the EU is dominated by Germany and France but only because we don't use the power we have. If we didn't elect MEPs like Nigel Farage who put their politics ahead of doing anything useful with their votes (seriously go look at UKIP MEPs' voting records) then we would be on an equal footing with France and not far behind Germany.

I had no reason to believe it was wrong, therefore, I had to reason to enquire. Now I'm paranoid about missing an appointment and I end up phoning each week to confirm the appointment and then ring again later in the day to confirm again to rule it out.

I did end up going to a decision maker and they ruled in my favour but that was the second time they'd fucked up and cost me.

Due to my appointment moving back all the time, I was eventually seen in November last year, which meant I fell under a new law introduced last October, where you now have to go through a mandatory reconsideration. Basically, the Jobcentre has to re-look at your case before you can apply to the tribunal. When I phoned the Jobcentre, they demanded that I provided more evidence, in order for them to look at my case again, however, I did not have anything that I'd not already provided. Fortunately, as a result of my previous ATOS woes, I have a direct number to a JC manager (from writing a complaint to the DWP Director). The manager got them to start the reconsideration process. In that time, my ESA and housing benefit stopped, so the only option for me (suggested by the manager &amp; JC) was to claim JSA, however, because I struggled getting to the initial appointment the benefit never started. Fortunately, my landlord gave me food, and leeway on rent, and I was able to borrow money from my parents. The reconsideration returned the same result - ""I was fit for work"", so I then sent my appeal to the court. After the court confirmed receipt of my appeal, I phoned the JC, to request reinstatement of ESA and back payment, however, they said they could not do that, as I'd had previously asked for my benefit claim to be closed! so they told me that my only option was to claim JSA! After phoning the JC manager, he sorted that out for me too.

The most painful thing, is that in the middle of last year, I voluntarily started going to a Jobcentre outreach worker based at my GP's surgery (my doctor referred me after we both agreed it might help), and during the weekly appointments, my confidence was building, and I could begin picturing myself being self-employed. However, just before she was about to refer me to the Shaw Trust, the ATOS appointment cancelling issue started, which caused all kinds of issues, so my outreach appointments stopped.

true,PeeledApples,cnty-scotland,Still British,"This thread illustrates the issue I have with travellers. 

I abhor racism, prejudice, witch-hunts, commonly held misconceptions, and all that sort of shit. I absolutely believe that all people should be considered on their own merits, based on what they do, not necessarily who they are, or whatever group they belong or whatever culture they're from. Every principle I hold as important tells me that travellers are people who deserve the time of day, and deserve to be treated with respect until demontrated otherwise, same as anyone else. I believe it's better to assume that someone could be a friend than an enemy.

I'm generally able to maintain all that, until I'm presented with them. Or until I'm presented with stories about them. Travellers settle on the greens near my work. The area turns to shit, and is left a toxic dump. One comes to the door of my dad's to offer services, I answer it, and decline on his behalf, since he never accepts services or goods from door to door sellers anyway. Traveller refuses to leave unless I call for him. A stalemate ensues, which eventually concludes in him squaring up to me, and calling me a cunt.  Etc, etc. 

The Guardian and some of my more hardline socialist friends are very pro-traveller. I try to agree with them, and I try to be the voice of reason with my more right-wing friends. But then, well, look at the photos /u/beIIe-and-sebastian posted further into this thread.

A little yellow cake Uranium goes missing in Africa naturally who hears about it?

I walked into a different agency with my CV, and said I was looking for temporary work. They looked at me as if I'd asked if it was OK to shit on the desk. They told me to phone them back at 8 the next morning. When I did, they told me to phone back the next day. The same happened again, and I gave up.

Another time, I went into an agency with a friend. They got us to fill in our details, and then we left. We'd forgotten about it, then got a phone call a few weeks later asking both of us to work for a couple of days. A company wanted some rubbish cleared from their site.

The fez is stuck in its own personal time loop.
This has been mentioned before on this subreddit, here: http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1rsjgz/question_about_the_fez_in_the_50th/ But it didn't go into much detail, so I thought I would expand on it.
To begin, it is located in the under gallery, which, as Kate Stewart says, houses ""all art deemed too dangerous for the public."" There 11 finds it, and being unable to resist a cool hat, puts it on. Of course, when the time portal opens back onto 10 in the sixteen hundreds, 11 throws the fez through first and follows, and when 11 tosses the fez back in again with a shout of ""fez incoming!"" it does not land at Clara's feet but instead made it all the way back to the War Doctor, who then hops over the the sixteen hundreds himself with the question ""anyone lose a fez?""
Got it?
Undergallery
1600s
Unidentified desert planet in the Time War
1600s
Now, this is the interesting part. The fez is not seen for the rest of the episode, and therefore was obviously placed by Queen Elizabeth I in the undergallery because of its connection to the Doctor, but if that is the case, then the fez is caught in a permanent loop, forced to go round and round for all eternity. So my question is this:
WHERE DID THE FEZ COME FROM?
A fez cannot simply materialize, it had to exist somewhere before it entered the timeloop, therefore, it must also leave. Now obviously, it is possible that 11 picked up the fez (an earlier version, fez.1) and swapped it out for that same fez he first put on in the undergallery (fez.2) therefore, fez.1 matures in the undergallery into fez.2 in time for 11 to pick it up and send it on its merry journey through the time portals.
This is possible, but I find it unlikely. If 11 had swapped out fez.1 for fez.2, then he would have been in possession of fez.2 after the events of the Day of the Doctor, but he wasn't wearing a fez, or indeed a hat of any kind at any point in the Time of the Doctor. If he had a fez, he would surely be wearing it.
Therefore, I will conclude with this theory, though whether it will prove to be in any way related to the truth, only time will tell. It was not 11 who released the fez, it was 12. He was there when the Doctors froze Gallifrey, so he is already part of events, it would make sense if he solved that pesky little problem of the fez in the loop.
But mostly I just want to give the writers an excuse to let us see more of 10 and 11.

He had one tackle, which was midway through the second half. He also had 0 interceptions.

He had two shots all game. Both of them were well taken, but let's not overhype a player who has never scored a league goal.

What I've got to say, that's an unpopular opinion. Because I'm a human being and not some bogeyman you've half made up. I lived as a traveller. Not my choice- my parent's. Nevertheless I lived it.

You never saw us. You see the ones who are in your towns, and of course they're wankers. Why would you choose to live a transient lifestyle in a town? But you never saw us or our friends long enough to form an opinion because you, like them, are townie cunts. They're nice and easy to group though aren't they? Instead of being cunts they're now gyppo cunts and soon the cunt is implied.

We never stole. We never ruined the area. We improved the fucking area.     
You dicks came along and littered and shat all over the place (often literally) and who cleaned it up? Us.    
Who called the fire brigade on forest fires and the police on joyriders? Us. Who set those fires and stole those cars in the first place? You.
   
Who adopted your abandoned kittens? We did. And then who stole the same kitten when it was a little bigger? Oh, that's right- you. Some middle class walkers came along, gave us the usual disdainful looks, and then our kitten was gone. The kitten only months before we rescued from certain death because it was too young to be left alone. That we wormed and de-flead and was going to get him neutered.

And yet it's not you is it? You'll probably want to stick up for house dwellers, or at least you can see that everyone will know ""you"" is a rhetorical device. You, real you, not ""you"" deny me that right.

Fuck you. I won't give you your validation. You are a bigot, and we did more for our environment than you would think of. I'm sorry cunts ruined your shitty scrubland parks, or whatever dull whitterings you're going on about but don't you dare think you can call several groups of people bad just because you met the wrong ones.

true,istara,australia,Australia,"I think I get where you are coming from and am on a similar page.

However I think it needs to be fairly acknowledged that they are a significantly problematic group that do not integrate on most levels with regular society, nor intend/want to.

The problem is that we do live in a system where we ""pay in"" and pool resources. That's why there is so much resentment towards those that exploit that system, be they benefits cheats, people that never intend to work, or possibly the travelling community.

If your life choice is to live in such a way that your survival can only be maintained by welfare or crime, I don't think it is appropriate that society should have to maintain you. But we also accept that we can't let people starve, nor can we prevent them from having as many children as they want to, etc.

I don't know what the answer is. I do know that on thread after thread after thread on here that Roma/travellers are vilified, and given that Reddit can be quite extraordinarily tolerant and anti-racist (a few trolls excepted) then I think that one has to finally consider that maybe there is some fire behind this smoke.

I don't think a Guardianesque stance of defending this people helps anyone, *including them*.  We simply don't live in a world where itinerant lifestyles without work are sustainable any more (if they ever were). You can certainly live an itinerant lifestyle with certain professions, from carnival workers to travelling salespeople or seasonal agricultural work.

If you're a Tory voter, have always been a Tory voter and believe that the Conservatives are the only hope for the economy improvement to which is your only hope of a better life then it might make sense to vote Tory even as they take your home from you and leave you hungry in the street. These people naively expect that when the economy is ""fixed"" everything will be alright.

There's an interesting discussion here: http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?p=63951876

It's actually a huge demographic once you remember many people are unemployed really but not counted in the statistics, including many people who up till now were considered disabled but who will now be required to work. There's no way a bloc vote of around 6 million is all voting against the Tories or the Tories would never get in. So some of the people who would be absolutely crazy to vote Tory must be doing so.

Another question is who else to vote for? Labour have not always shown sympathy for people out of work. In fact the crackdown on ""scroungers"" and ""malingerers"" goes back at least 20 years and the policies IDS is implementing have been in development for a long time. Last year Labour announced an intention to scrap benefits for the under 25s http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/10461175/Labour-Well-scrap-benefits-for-under-25s.html

What we may see is a shift in these Tory benefits claimants from the Tories to Ukip. If you see the benefits crackdown as a war between out of touch Westminster millionaires and out of luck honest claimants it makes sense to vote for Farage's ""people's army.""

Don't. Things will turn around.

It's very clear that a government that depends on voter swings can't simply declare all out war on 6 million of its people, things will turn around.

What you need to do is survive.

Start taking control of your life by taking control of your finances as a family. Being really organised is what will get you through. Write down all your expenditure and income like you were running a business and work on each item to min/max it. For instance

- utilities. Can you shop around and save money?

- online opportunities. Are you filling in forms for Yougov etc? Use every option to make a little money including ebay decluttering.

- earn up to £5 a week without it affecting your benefit (possibly more depending on your situation, get advice from your Job centre adviser about Earned Income Disregard). Make sure you earn this, knock on doors and offer to mow lawns or wash cars using their equipment in a rich area.

- manage your debt. http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/debt_w/faq_index_debt/faq_debt_debts_getting_out_of_control.htm

- manage your luxuries. I hate to type this advice but sweets and toys for the kids, even pocket money are luxuries. If you have internet you don't need a TV licence, use iplayer. Depending on their age they may even be able to contribute to the household by doing paper rounds or something. (Christ. I REALLY hated giving that advice. Better for the kids than having you dead though).

- use free stuff. Food banks, public libraries, free internet etc.

Stay strong. Things will change in fact there will be a backlash and we'll likely see a robust alternative method like Universal Basic Income coming in.

If you don't find them, let me know and I'll send you a couple of packets. 

&gt; That's pretty handy then! How long will that last you? It's quite a score, going from what you say.

Probably 4-6 weeks. There's nothing you can do to stop them clogging up, which is frustrating. 

&gt;You've just confused the issue there now, love! It's a small banana, not an average banana. How do I know how you define the ""smallness"" of a banana?

It's about an inch inferior to a normal banana.

&gt;How do you go through glasses so much? 

Because I am a klutz/butterfingers/heavy handed. I stopped buying expensive wine glasses many, many years ago.
