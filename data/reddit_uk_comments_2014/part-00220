Funny how people tend to go to a lot of bother to make sure such imports are UK road legal though.

The idea the police would ignore a vehicle that was not road legal and had no road tax, MOT or insurance is quite frankly stupid. I am struggling to think of anyone who would be dumb enough to not be able to understand this. If the Police see something being driven on the road without a number plate or their plate search does not return a result you are getting pulled over and you are going to have some serious explaining to do.

I know in the US they have all sorts of weird variations between states on what constitutes a road legal vehicle so I would guess this is the origin of the idea but quite how anyone could think it would work in the UK is beyond me.

I probably do. It's more than I'm on. It's just the starting wage, right, or are you still on £19k?

&gt; Loads of holidays? Are you sure about that? They get about the national average, but with the added bonus of having their rest days and annual leave being cancelled at the whims of the courts or their force.

Interesting, my mate who's in the police is often on holiday. Perhaps it's because of flexible working hours, another advantage many other jobs don't get.

&gt; Overtime? Unpaid overtime being forced on you is a bonus now?

I'd love to see a source for police overtime being unpaid if you have one.

&gt; Early retirement? Check your sources, gone are the days of 30 years service for anyone joining up now.

So what is it now? [From what I can see](https://www.gov.uk/police-pension-reform) it's still earlier than most.

Not recently. Share them if you have them. Many jobs put you at risk of assault, not many give you a stab vest and weaponry.

Piers have a lot of columns at narrow intervals to support a large static load - it doesnt shift or move around much. With moving weight (Ie, people) the large number of columns means that the bending moment of that weight is support easily because there is a structural member nearby to take the load. Also, because the columns are relatively short , of I or box girder section and cross braced, the structure is generally very rigid and resistant to outside forces.

A suspension bridge, on the other hand, is a dynamic structure in constant movement from a variety of sources - namely the wind and moving traffic. Each section of the bridge can be though of as a sufficiently massive (and generally rather rigid)connected pendulum system.

Have you ever been to a kids play park and walked across one of those bridges which are supported by chains? As you walk along, the part where you are bearing your weight is generally the lowest part of the bridge. Its the same idea here, except that in a full size suspension bridge the supports (and suspension cables) are large and strong enough for you not to notice any change in bridge deflection either up or down.

&gt;In 1959 a fire destroyed the pavilion located at the shore end of the pier. Over 500 people were trapped on the other side of the fire and had to be rescued by boat.

&gt;The pavilion was replaced by a ten-pin bowling alley in 1962, however, by then British holidaymakers were turning to package holidays abroad. The use of the pier slowly began to decline and with it the structure began to deteriorate. In 1971, after a child was injured on the pier, a survey was undertaken and over the course of the next decade repairs had to be made including much of the replacement of the pier walkway.
burnt section in 1983

&gt;In 1976 a fire destroyed much of the pier head. The massive blaze was battled by fire fighters working on the pier and from boats, and even using a crop-spraying light aircraft. The following year the bowling alley was damaged in another fire, and a year after that, the railway was deemed unsafe and had to be closed.

&gt;In 1980 the council announced that the pier was to close. Protests led the council to allow the pier to remain open until a solution could be found. This happened in 1983 when the Historic Buildings Committee gave a grant to allow repairs to be made. The work commenced in 1984 and was completed eighteen months later, when Princess Anne named the two new pier trains (commissioned to replace trains scrapped in 1982) after Sir John Betjeman and Sir William Heygate. The total cost of the repair including new buildings and pier trains was £1.3M.
temporary bridge, railway station and collapsed section in 1987

&gt;However, on 20 June in that year, the MV Kingsabbey crashed into the pier, severing the new pier head from the rest of the pier, destroying the boathouse used by the lifeboat service and causing major structural damage due to the destruction of iron piles and supporting girders. This left a 70-foot gap in the pier. While this was temporarily bridged to restore access, full repairs were not completed until 1989.

&gt;On 7 June 1995 the bowling alley burnt down. Fortunately the pier museum and railway station were not severely damaged and access to the pier was reinstated three weeks later, with all of the debris cleared in time for the summer of 1996.

&gt;On 9 October 2005 a fire severely damaged much of the Old Pier Head including the railway station, pub, shell shop, snack bar and ice cream shop.

Alternatively, look at Azpilicueta. At the start of last season, he seldom played, and most figured that he'd be the first one out the door.

So she could have downloaded a form off the internet and signed it with a friend witnessing it. Maybe the age of the deed poll is a positive thing since it suggests this isn't a drunken bet to get a joke passport. Maybe it's a negative thing since it suggests she isn't really using the name for all purposes. After all, she was happy to have a passport with the wrong name and signature for six years.

&gt; ""It's on my driving licence, my bank cards, everything. Everyone else is happy with that signature apart from passport office,"" she said.

Which she presumably hasn't (yet) proved to the passport office, and if you suspect that an application is fraudulent you probably shouldn't just take the applicant's word that it isn't.

&gt; It will only cause more problems for her if she has a driving license and passport that don't match.

She's apparently coped well enough for six years.

I agree that they should have accepted this particular case, or at least should have requested further information rather than rejecting it outright. However, the general principle that the passport office should be filtering applications in some way to prevent fraud and identity theft seems reasonable enough.

Given the current shambles at the passport office with every member of staff who has ever seen a passport being drafted in to process applications, I'm not surprised to see some questionable handling of the rules around the edge cases.

Only things I can think of to add are possible personnel changes if Lambert decides to go with the 3-5-2 ... which I suspect he might if Vlaar sticks around. Or he will at least use it in certain matches.

In a 3-5-2, I imagine Bacuna starts over Lowton because he's better going forward, and N'Zogbia would be shifted into the middle (or bumped out entirely to allow Cole to play) since he's similar to Bacuna in the sense that he doesn't always track back. Richardson would play LWB, surely.

Wouldn't surprise me to see Weimann start centrally while we wait for Kozak/Benteke to return either, as he's a better finisher than Agbonlahor. FWIW, I'd put Gabby in the middle though, he's stronger and can hold the ball up.

Grealish definitely the one to watch. Very confident, provides a spark not unlike Weimann in his first senior season. Keep an eye out for Gardner and Robinson too. Both seem likely to get a decent amount of minutes this year, particularly Robinson while half our strikers are out.

Other thing to keep an eye on is whether or not Hutton and Bent can break back into the team and make a difference. I suspect neither will really fit into a 4-3-3 like Lambert tends to use. Both could be useful in a 3-5-2 though. Hutton loves to get forward, and Bent would have enough support to be effective.",0,1406801315,null,0,false,0,cjcvk7a,t3_2c6384,t1_cjcvk7a,t1_cjcblht,null,1434989045,3,false,avfc,t5_2s569,3

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"There have been darker times to be honest, even in the PL Era. We got good money for him that was very much needed, but what hurt was not losing him, but the betrayal. He essentially said he would stay (Once a Blue, Always a Blue.. His words), then when United came sniffing he fucked off out the back door like a shot.

Nobody can blame him for moving to United, but the manner in which he did it hurt (akin to Moyes trying to unsettle our lads after leaving). Had he have said that he sees his future elsewhere, then we could have accepted it more. 

There have been embarrassments (Banega and Riquelme 'signing', wasting our money on Per Kroldrup, rumor has it because a scout got his name wrong) brushes with death (pre Kev Campbell in 1999, or pre-Moyes in 2002), more damaging transfers (Lescott), shocking signs of mismanagement (Baxter, Finch Farm or Gosling) and long periods of stagnation on all fronts.

For me though the most hurtful though was the total lack of ambition shown whenever we had a chance of getting into the Champions League. I respect that Bill has only done what he thought was best for the club, there there are times when we need to take a balanced risk, and up until this week it has seemingly been something he had avoided. 

The one that still hurts to this day is the CL qualification round in 2005. During that summer we sat on our hands, when it was abundantly clear to everyone that we were a million miles off having anywhere close to a solid team. The previous season our top scorer was a midfielder, and our goalscoring options up top were McFadden (who averaged about 1 goal in 9 for us), Bent (Marcus, not Darren- who we paid pennies for, and he wasn't even worth that), James Beattie (hard working player, but miles off being a goalscorer) and Big Dunc (fucking legend amongst legends, but an old man by this time).. This was not the sort of front line who could do the damage we need in Europe. 

There has been discussion ever since about the draw and the games- and yes it was dodgy (Cliff Notes at the bottom), but it is not like it was totally fixed. We were shit for 80% of the tie, and probably didn't deserve to win. Having a talisman up front would have made such a difference, but Bill wanted to wait to see if we qualified before spending money... Something that ultimately cost us the chance of getting into the group stage, something that could have changed Everton history for good. 

Since then we have been in great positions at Xmas a few times, but with the squad tiring we didn't bring quality in, and we always ended up getting pipped. 12-13 is one such recent example- we were 4th at new year, looking decent, but lacking a striker once more. Fellaini was playing as a makeshift target man, and doing a good job... But he is not a top 4 striker, and our weaknesses were being exploited even during the window (I remember being shut out by Southampton and I think Swansea), and it seemed teams were wising up how to play against us. 

There were rumors of a load of potential strikers- Alvaro Negredo being one, but we wouldn't meet the £13m asking price... What a bargain that would have been.. But in the end we only signed Stones, a great buy.. But not someone who would help us get that top 4. As predicted though, the window shut and our performances went downhill, and the game we needed to win to get top 4 ended 0-0 (vs Arsenal) despite us dominating.. We just didn't have anyone finishing off chances. 

This is pretty typical though, and as I say I understand Bill having to be stingy, but it took a man named Roberto to show him what effect a balanced risk can have. We can't keep up with the pack if we keep that 'James Beattie' mentality of signing players who are just good enough to play in the PL, we need to be buying the sort of players who have big potential like Suarez, Eriksen or Bony, because that is what our rivals are doing, and it seems as though that is the way we are looking forward.

Well nobody outside the club knows who we're interested in and the people who know we're interested in are not, and should not be talking to the media. So if you're going to write an article on our possible transfer targets you're going to have to pull a list of people, who fit the mold, from you're ass. 

I agree that they should have included Cavani on the list (though I don't necessarily think we should sign him) since he on purely footballing terms would be suited to our team. Di Maria and Turan were excluded probably because though they could be said to be forwards they can hardly be described as strikers.

Many Villa fans will however be hoping that we can retain the services of Messrs Vlaar and Delph and add a little more quality before the season begins.

2. Lambert has generally stuck with two formations over the psat two seasons and I expect this season to be no different. Either a 433 (Guzan, Bacuna, Vlaar, Okore, Richardson, Westwood, Delph, El Ahmadi, Agbonlahor, Weimann, Zog) or a 352 (Guzan, Vlaar, Okore, Clark / Baker / Senderos, Bacuna, Richardson, Westwood, Delph, Zog / Cole, Agbonlahor, Weimann)

3.   
Jack Grealish has impressed in loan spells and scored the only villa goal of a preseason defeat last night. He won't be a permanent fixture in the first team, but Villa fans are hoping that we will see flashes of the promise which has lead to him being hyped as the Irish Messi.  

Jores Okore played only a handful of games last season before rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament. He is young (still only 21) but already has Champions League experience, impressing in a match for his old club Nordsjælland against chelsea [Video](http://vimeo.com/53073475). His return from injury to partner Ron Vlaar could be crucial in shoring up our notoriously leaky defence.  

Andreas Weimann has impressed in preseason, providing one goal and three assists. He's known for his industrious work rate and despite providing some important goals, is yet to find the consistency which his industry deserves. However, with Benteke and Kozak still on the sidelines, many Villa fans will hope that Andreas can find his shooting boots in the early part of the season.

He wanted to be first choice. He was told that wasn't guaranteed at Chelsea, so he's asked to be sold to Everton where he knows he will be first choice. He's not ""ducking the competition"", he wants to be somewhere where he knows he will play games as it will aid his development.

The whole thing is embarrassing. We’d better have a very good season this year as that is the only way the Chelsea hierarchy (especially Jose) will redeem themselves. A lot of Chelsea fans are scratching their heads trying to make sense of some of the deals we have done recently and the way in which the club doesn’t give its academy youth a chance to make it to the first team. To the rest of the football fraternity we are just a laughing stock. Sure it made sense for us to bring Matic back to the club but forking out £20m for him proves that we were wrong to let him go in the first place. Letting Ashley Cole go makes no sense and then we go out and spend £16m to replace him. Bringing in Fabregas (and at £30m) makes little sense to me. There are enough first team midfielders and kids on the fringes (Chalobah, Ake etc) who could do the job. We’ve now put all our faith in Costa who, though a top player is unproven in the Premiership. God help us if he crocs or flops. And in the midst of all that we bring back a 36yr old Drogba (bearing in mind that Jose made a derogatory comment about Eto’o’s age last season). Drog’s was a good player for us during his first spell (he definitely isn’t our greatest player ever – some of us have long memories, numerous games where he just wasn’t interested and practically sabotaged the team’s efforts to overcome its opponents) but he is probably past it now. And then we’ve got Torres who continues to be clueless in front of goal. It seems to me that Lukaku should have been given his chance. With the right support HE could easily have turned out to be our greatest player ever. Yes, he may have an “attitude” but, at worst, it is only a function of his youth. More likely it is out of his frustration from not being given his chance at Chelsea. His comment yesterday that he “has the trust of the players and staff” at Everton and therefore feels at home there was a passing shot in Chelsea’s direction and well justified in my opinion. I just hope we haven’t burned our bridges with him. More importantly I hope the terms of the sale mean that we have first option to buy him back if Everton decide to sell during the term of his five year contract. Either that or at least there is a sell-on clause entitling us to a share of any proceeds in excess of say £40m should Everton decide to sell. If we haven’t manoeuvred to do that as an absolute minimum, then we are complete and utter mugs. This kid is going to be one of the best strikers in Europe if not the world. His sell-on value will be in excess of £50m in three years’ time.

When they made the offer (one that is huge for a player that would only play 2-3 games a season) he made his choice.

So he had two choices here: Either stay in Chelsea as a reserve or go to Everton (a club where he played before and was excellent) and play every game. For Ozil, it was: Either stay in Real Madrid and play most of the games or go to Arsenal (shitty club) and play most of the games.

Lukaku was told (as with all of Mourinho's players) that competition for players is based on merit alone. Therefore, minutes cannot be guaranteed. Rom thought this wasn't best for his development and so he left. Well good luck to him.

When I look at this situation, I cannot help but think of his Belgian compatriot Courtois.

true,Doomslicer,eng-norfolk,Norwich,"&gt;Older people will always have more wealth than the young


Ok, let's address this. Look at the article and quote the whole bit there;


&gt; The fastest growth in inequality isn’t between London and the rest of the UK, or the rich and poor, but the young and old.


See that? I'll focus us in a bit.


&gt; The fastest growth in inequality


Do you see it?


&gt; The fastest *growth* in inequality


Now let's look back at what you said;


&gt; Older people will always have more wealth than the young


Okay, that makes sense. Wealth will always be unequal between the young and the old. Old people will be richer than young people. Okay. There will always be that gap.


Today's young people will one day be tomorrow's old people, and they will then, in turn, have more money than tomorrow's youth.


But what did the article say again?


&gt; The fastest *growth in inequality*


What does that mean?


That the *gap is increasing*. Increasing at quite a fast pace.


Today's young people are poor compared to today's old people.


But the difference between the two is larger than it has ever been. Old people are much much richer than young people now. Go back 20 years and the gap between the young poor 20 years ago and the old rich 20 years ago is much much smaller than it is today.


That's the problem.


The gap between the old and young is pretty much expected and inevitable.


But the gap should be a constant distance, with minimal change. The relative wealth of young people to old people should remain the same.

true,Doomslicer,eng-norfolk,Norwich,"&gt;The scientific community says research on live animals is vital to understanding disease and has resulted in new vaccines and also treatments for cancer, Parkinson's disease, asthma and HIV


Wow, that's some pretty decent results, I wonder what the opposition has in their favour...

&gt;but opponents say it is cruel and pointless, as alternative research methods are available.


Oh, ok then. No specifics? Ok.


Suffering should be minimised, use should be minimised, but sometimes the only way to study something involves animal testing. Testing for cosmetics should obviously not be permitted.


Animal testing is a *huge huge pain* in terms of additional overhead work, as well as actually doing the work itself - and most scientists would prefer not to do it anyway. I'm pretty certain scientists are already sufficiently motivated to avoid using animal models if they can.

Earning 41k doesn't ""make you rich"". Peoples circumstances are all different. Some people get roped in to crappy mortgages, other people struggle with health costs, house issues or change in circumstances. I have friends on 41k who can't afford to buy a flat where they've lived for the past 10 years - hey don't drive nice cars or live in massive houses. They're not poor but they aren't rich.

How many people do you have to tax a few grand extra to make up the 6 Billion in tax Vodaphone ALONE owes? If you want better hospitals, schools, wages and police then tax the corporations more.

Tesco's made £3.3bn in profits last report. They pay their staff such a low wage that a vast number of it's workforce claim government benefits in order to survive.

That's why I prefaced my comment with the ""this is a tangent"" disclaimer. The main idea was to simplify and get rid of brackets in the middle where they don't really make sense, except to keep people, well, bracketed.

Many of the parameters could, I suppose, be supplied by the Office for National Statistics who have all the information necessary to see what the national total gross pay is. Then they'd advise how to shift the curve ""fairly"" to ensure that just the right amount of tax is claimed back to keep the Exchequer in the black.

My own sensibilities would have the curve extend through a sweet spot where income tax becomes zero then negative and becomes income support instead. In the interests of fairness this should be done statistically and chosen suitably high that no-one ends up starving.

It doesn't immediately address the fact that the jobless and homeless won't have that help from the income tax/support system, but that's where the benefits system comes in.

No, actually the UK has much more restrictive copyright law than many countries. In particular, the US fair use law is really vague, and the only way to know if a novel type of copyright use is legal is to try it and see if anyone wins in court suing you.

This is bad from the point of view of lack of certainty, but it does mean you get to try things if you're brave enough.

In the UK we have a number of narrow, specific exemptions. Which means you can be reasonably confident if your use is permitted under the law or not. But it also means that your new technology with it's novel thing is probably illegal for the first twenty years of it's existence (the UK only legalised ripping your own audio CDs to your computer *this week*).

(It's worth noting that these blanket licenses of the BBC are not ""this covers absolutely everything"", but ""this covers almost all works with a narrow list of unallowed pieces, subject to these specific use scenarios"". It doesn't allow the BBC to sell those programmes for example, which is why they have to reclear and why the iTunes and international versions of Top Gear often have different music.

This is also one of the reasons why people in the US who say ""why can't I pay the licence fee and get access to the full UK iPlayer"" are never, ever going to get any good news on that front.)",0,1406808633,null,0,1406813322,0,cjcx4g9,t3_2c7k9y,t1_cjcx4g9,t3_2c7k9y,null,1434989796,8,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8

&gt; Pretty much all of third wave feminism is based on an ideology which has no connection to reality

Some feminists may be a bit extreme, but I wouldn't consider it to be inherently anti-science.

&gt; They celebrate 'diversity' by pretending that it doesn't exist and that every person is created with equal predispositions and talents, which is manifestly untrue.

I don't know anybody who thinks like this.

&gt; Meanwhile, the most successful, freest, most tolerant societies in the world are all, without exception, capitalist in nature.

Yet those countries that are too capitalist and don't seek to address inequality tend to fare worse.

One could just as easily criticise trickle down economics and some on the right's failure to take seriously the many [economic problems](http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/about-inequality/effects) that go hand in hand with inequality.

One could also point to the many top economists like Krugman and Stiglitz who tend to think that the best path to prosperity involves progressive taxation and other measures to tackle inequality.

So for balance, here are some fringe ideas which are more popular amongst those on the right:

 - AGW denial

 - Homosexuality is ""unnatural""

 - The belief that children who grow up with same sex parents fare worse

 - Teaching creationism in schools

We know he played out wide with license to come in the season before last, and in a midfield of Lucas and Gerrard he had less to worry about in the back and so he had more runs at the box like we saw yesterday. Last season he was played in 2 man midfield with Gerrard with another advanced second striker/AM. This lets him focus on the pressing and defending while the players in front of him do the real attacking. We move to Gerrard in holding role and play Hendo in 3 man midfield, but due to our high pressing style, he doesn't get much time to do anything else as he runs for himself and compensates for Gerrard.


We now have 2 players with 80-90% of his workrate in Can and Lallana, in a midfield 3 they will each be able to do their part and help out with pressing in Gerrards place. This allows Hendo to get much more closer to the box without worrying about what happens when he moves up, he obviously missed good chances last season, but that is something he will probably work on. 10 goals over a season in all competitions would for him be something like a goal every 5 games, which puts him at a goal every 400-450 minutes, this is very doable if we can keep high scoring rate.


Rodgers will go easy on Can for his first season, already stated Coutinho is our brain in order to probably have him focus less on scoring from 40 yards out to making passes. I think he will expect Lallana and Hendo to fill in that goal void from midfield, then hope Sterling/Marko/Sturridge and whatever forward comes will cover much of the rest with the backup players doing the rest.",0,1406808961,null,0,false,0,cjcx7oy,t3_2c7u4x,t1_cjcx7oy,t3_2c7u4x,null,1434989821,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Shicchan,lfc99,,"I personally think he does have end product. He's an established forward in a very strong Bundesliga side, and was consistently strong until they had that horrible run of form that ended in Sami getting the sack. A great thing about our team is the amount of potential due to the side being so youthful and talented for the most part, but to say his price is mostly based upon his potential is a little misrepresentative of his current skill level. 

Anyway, I reckon he'd be more useful and accustomed to us than Bony would, despite the lack of experience in England. Also, I don't think it's THAT necessary to buy more PL players. Look at our signings this season - Lallana, Lambert, Can, Lovren, Markovic, Origi. Of those, Origi isn't playing for us yet, the three L's have experience in England and Can seems to be settling in very well. Furthermore Son has played at the top level of European football for longer than Markovic and I think would settle in well.

I think you're wrong about the strength of the Left's opposition to the science of human nature.

I read the Guardian every day and heritability of intelligence and the existence of gender differences are virtual taboos.  I don't think I'm using straw-men.

I also read Krugman!  Yes, I agree that taxation is a necessary part of the equation, but the paragraph you're referring to was specifically criticizing the communist/Marxist left.  

I happen to have a PhD in physics and it's been my experience that there are plenty of smart scientists allied with all parts of the political spectrum.

I personally don't think Ibe is ready just yet, a season on loan with a lower-end/mid-table Premier League side would really help him. Suso in a similar position too.

But anyway, if we had another injury to for example Lallana, we'd only have Markovic and Sterling starting with no genuine quality to come off the bench.

Of course I agree with you, but you did criticise those on the left for fringe ideas that most people on the left would consider crazy and extreme.

Given that you adopted this approach, I felt it was only fair to pick other fringe ideas for which most of it's proponents are on the right.

Atletico are not poor, I know, but with Schurrle being a key player in Chelsea, the price for him is way more than Atletico can pay for a player like Schurrle. Atletico can get a player of the same position for maybe half of Schurrle's price so it's just a waste of money for them. 

I said we have only 3 strikrs (Costa, Drogba and Torres), I didn't say Schurrle's a number 9. if you've watched him playing, you know he always stays very deep on the side supporting the lone attacker.

We actually have a very promising youth setup now, especially with the new Training Centre which is one of the best in Europe. We've picked up some great results and performances against other top class academies too - and like LEGEND Roy Makaay said himself - *very impressed with Spurs, and said we seemed much more technically able than other English teams he'd seen in the past*

Motm for Eng u17's against Germany in a number 10 role, but plays more like a Townsend that actually can pass/look up. 

*some names for you*

Winks (just signed his deal - always got rave reviews, I think he can break the first team).

Oduwa ([cheeky goal in Ledders testimonal,](http://www.footballtube.com/uploads/img/5373357f3e002-onlyorneryibadanmalimbe.gif) excelled in the number 10 role for England under 17's and was voted Man of the Match vs Germany)

Lesniak,

Marcus Edwards (Eng under 16's/17's) *Marcus Edwards, of Tottenham Hotspur, in the Under-16s, who lights up in the role in the hole, the systems and the technical approach now apparent in the national teams are the same. England is bedding in a new DNA right down through the age groups – hopefully for ages to come.*

Alfie Whiteman, (eng under 17's GK)

Ogilvie (England under 17's, looked a BOSS)

I agree about the attack. Jovetic had a great game. Navas was tearing up the right side and putting some great balls into the area. One thing that jumped out about Navas is his hesitation to shoot. I think there were a few times (maybe only 1 or 2) where he elected to cross instead of making an attempt on goal. 

Both Caballero and Hart looked great. Willy's close range save against Lambert was huge. I definitely think he could start ahead of Hart. However, I think the competition for the starting spot will be great for both of them.

Demographic trends were emerging in the late 60 and throughout the 70s, before the large increases in wealth inequality that we saw during the 1980s and onward. You can see the transition away from straight labour market entrance toward education for people entering the labour market in the early 90s. While wealth probably plays a role, there is probably some sort of reverse causality in the manner of the diverging destinies argument from the US. 

&gt; I was thinking about higher education which has gone from being funded by the tax pool ( mainly the wealthy) to the student (mainly middle class)

I'm not sure that represents a movement of money given that funding actual students would have been a comparatively slight burden given low higher educational enrolment rates.

Very sorry if i came across rude last night was just super disappointed with the way things have worked out.

I understand Ronny is trying to make us play football like Barca or something with all his passing but we are just not at that level, how many times did we give the ball away ? 

We made so many mistakes all over the pitch it was laughable.

I do agree with another comment from someone else saying that Ambrose is decent in the scottish league but he just makes to many mistakes vs the bigger teams/games. I'd be quite happy to get rid of him and find a replacement for 500k who's better.

true,sjampen,lfc99,,"I was really against selling Suarez simply because we can't replace him straight up, but you're right, it absolutely had to be done and you can't blame the club. My opinion is just that sooooo many LFC fans now seem to forget how awesome he was, now that he is gone. 

What really bothers me is the Tottenham thing. When you sell your Luis Suarez, you don't replace him with Lallana(Very good PL player, not great), you replace him with the likes of Di Maria, Sanchez, Reus(Some of the best players in their league). To me it feels like the reason we're not doing it, is because we're cheap. We're finally in great position to sign big players, Champions League, money from the Suarez sale, a really exiting manager and stability in the organization(Imagine this, its now even been 5 years since Roy Hodgson was the manager...Ugh). Instead I see Chelsea and even Arsenal improve their squad with the likes of Costa, Sanchez, Fabregas. City we all know has a incredible squad and I doubt they won't sign someone huge. Hell, even the other Mancs reacted to their piss poor season. They might have overpaid for Shaw and Herrera, but I really like both players and at least they fucking did something. They still have a shitty central defense and midfield, but then they are rumored to sign Vidal or Pogba, our top targets seem to be fucking Bony and Bertrand. Surely, it should be the other way around, with the CL club signing Vidal and Pogba.

I'm fine with signing Lallana, surely he is gonna be good, but he should be a signing competing with Coutinho, like Markovic should be a signing competing with Raheem. The problem is that we're missing the big signing, and that makes either Can, Lallana or Markovic Suarez direct replacement. We've strengthen the depth. With the ability to substitute Lambert, Can, Markovic instead of Aspas, Teixera and Moses we're a better, deeper team, but we haven't gotten closer to beating Citys or Chelseas best 11, quite the opposite actually. I love the signing of Markovic and Can, I think they will go on to be wonderful players for us, but I can't imagine that they will provide noticeable impacts in the 14/15 season.

I trust Brendan very much, but theres two areas where I think he still shows struggles: Transfers and Defending. For every awesome action, there has been more questionable. Coutinho and Sturridge obviously great, Aspas, Luis Alberto, Moses, Cissokho, Sahin, Assaidi. Then theres Allen, Migs and Sakho. They surely have a future, but has Allen really played like his transfer fee? Sakho and Migs are obviously very new and have shown both great and horrendous things. I personally believe that Sakho will show a lot of people wrong this year, but so far he hasn't been worth his transfer. Migs I'm unfortunately very unimpressed with. He won't go anywhere anytime soon, but he is not and IMO never will be a top keeper. 

Of Course that brings us to the defending, which since Rodgers arrival have been pretty much horrendous despite several efforts to improve. A now even Johnson and Enrique(Who all of the sudden seem to be a great LB in LFC fans eyes) are going down hill quickly.
Its a product of Rodgers being offensive minded, but still, does anyone actually feel going into a game that we can secure the win with a clean sheet? Yeah didn't think so. 

Maybe Lovren, and Sakho who I assume LFC expect to be the CB partnership of the future, will solve both problems but I remain skeptical. I see nothing but I saw from Spurs. Mostly signings of mediocre players, which meant Spurs had the ability to play with great constancy, they we're just consistently bad.

Stephen Kießling:

- He's 30 years old. Too old to be the impact substitute we need.

Edin Džeko:

- Manchester City would probably only accept ~£25m for him. Too expensive for a second choice centre forward.

Loïc Rémy:

- Good candidate. Cheap, young, and eager to prove himself at a top club.

Klaas-Jan Huntelaar:

- Another 30 year old. Too old.

- Schalke are a rich club and have no reason to sell. He won't come cheap.

Wilfried Bony:

- On par with Rémy in my list.

Kevin Volland:

- Young and exciting. My #1 choice for our second choice centre forward.

Timo Werner:

- Largely unproven. Might as well promote Bamford to second choice.

Stephen El Shaarawy:

- Messrs Galliani and Berlusconi wouldn't sell a starter for cheap.

- Not a centre forward to begin with. In a *4-2-3-1*, he plays best left wing - where Hazard is already stationed.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"Exactly, I agree wholeheartedly with what you're saying, but I think I've been unintentionally wording it in such a way that some people perceive it to be ""sympathising with the enemy"" - my bad.

I think anything Islam related is a very tricky subject to approach. On one hand, there are a lot of upstanding and decent Muslims in this country. On the other hand, there have been some high profile instances of violent (""extremist"") organizations associated with forms of Islam which make anything Islamic become a very emotive discussion.

As you said, the nearest to the ""right"" way of life is the dominant local culture, and out dominant local culture is one where people can say and think what they like. But terms like extremism and terrorism, similar to ""think of the children"",  can be abused by the supposed good guys who may try to hijack the emotions associated with ISIS and the likes to subtly shape the dominant culture in a way which the majority may not support.

But yes, I agree with you - people should be allowed to believe and say virtually any beliefs, but as soon as they start threatening or intimidating or impeding on other people's liberties, then they need to be approached. Although I don't think *"" every one of them flying that flag in the UK [should be] treat[ed] to a nice tour of their local nick and a rigorous full body search""* as OP suggested.

I sat relatively high up near in the middle of the stadium and had the luxury of being able to hear these folks on the left drown out the very limited number of City fans. There was a section on the opposite side of the field, but it was literally just an individual section with scattered City shirts here and there. 

The amount of Liverpool supporters that turned out was truly amazing. I was seeing red shirts all the way from Union Square a few hours before the match, all over the trains (with some chants here and there) on the way up to the stadium, a real ocean of red outside, inside and all around Yankee Stadium. There was a little parade of cheering Reds on the street outside of the stadium after the match, loud enough to hear from a block over.

Thank you all for a great first experience seeing Liverpool. Thank you for bringing so many shirts, scarves, banners, etc. Seeing kits from this current year going all the way back to a handful of vintage kits was sort of unexpected. 

Thank you, so much.

*Edit: Just a note about the photo and the empty seats in the top right corner. These weren't just empty seats, the wall directly next to them actually blocks a good part of the field that you otherwise wouldn't really need to see during a baseball game. People were stacked as far over as they could, but as you go higher up in those seats, you can see less.

We are capable of scoring goals. We have shown that with Suarez, without Suarez, with Sturridge, without Sturridge. We just really need to sure up our back 4 and change the way we go about the game when we're in lead. We should be closing games out by dominating the ball when we're one up. Not trying to outscore our opponents like last season. 

In terms of your question, I think Sterling will fill a lot creative void Suarez is going to leave. Sterling is not only about pace. He is quite intelligent on the ball and only uses his pace when he needs to. In yesterday's game he was the only player I saw that took his time to look up and make an intelligent pass instead of running around without much purpose (Coutinho) or misplacing passes by trying to move the ball forward quickly (Hendo, Allen). Sterling played some amazing balls to Sturridge.

Furthermore, the new striker getting 15 is purely speculation at this point, since we don't even know if we'll sign one. Since Remy broke down, we haven't been linked with anyone and we could decide Borini and Lambert is good enough.

The grey area with that clause is the phrase *congested conditions* which isn't specifically defined and means you can't always pass on the left in every situation. In the case where you've got an open motorway with one guy in the middle lane, it's pretty clear that it'd not be right to pass on the left. Lanes 2 and 3 slowed to a crawl but lane 1 moving (possibly because of a slip road approaching) that's obviously fine. Situation the OP describes where you've got clear road ahead, a lane hogger in lane 2 and cars in lane 3 that's somewhere in between but I'd argue that if the alternative is to cross 2 lanes of traffic, one lane of which has congestion in it so you'd have to insert yourself into traffic to do it, that situation would fall on the side of ""fine"".

Now, the ADI said ""think of a motorway gantry with a sign warning for upcoming congestion. What's the symbol?"" and it is of course three cars in a queue. So he argued that if you wanted to draw the line somewhere it'd be anywhere where you've got two cars in front of you in reasonably short distance, rather flippantly, but in actual fact it'd be a judgement call on whoever saw you doing it and the bottom line is as long as you're driving safely, you'd be unlikely to be stopped and if you were you could argue this clause because that's why it's there.",0,1406818250,null,0,false,0,cjd0trq,t3_2c8inb,t1_cjd0trq,t1_cjczj79,null,1434991704,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"**Overview**

After two years of financial austerity and persisting with youth, Paul Lambert has done a complete U-turn. As a result, we have our strongest squad yet. Many have questioned the acquisitions of spent forces like Joe Cole, Kieran Richardson and Phillipe Senderos but they will provide the experience and authority we lacked so far under Lambert. Meanwhile Darren Bent, Alan Hutton, Shay Given and Charles N'Zogbia, all once exiled to the reserve team, have been welcomed back into the squad. Everyone gets a clean slate and team morale will have improved. The return of Okore, Gardner, Kozak and Benteke from long-term injuries will provide a huge boost. In Carruthers and Grealish we have some promising young players and Fabian Delph's development is a reason to rejoice. One hopes that Ron Vlaar can maintain his impervious World Cup form in what will likely be his last season at Villa, as greener pastures beckon. Roy Keane represents perhaps the most important signing. As the assistant-manager, he will expect a lot of the players, and will not accept youth and inexperience as an excuse for underperforming. As Villa fans know, it is natural to approach every season with trepidation and this year is no different. However, there is cause to be optimistic. Our squad is stronger, our management is stronger and once Randy Lerner, our wantaway owner, finally exists stage right we can look to rebuild.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Players to watch**

*Gary Gardner* - It's do-or-die time for Gary, supposedly a far better talent than brother Craig. Arriving from the youth team with a lot of hype, he showed his ability under Houllier before suffering lengthy injuries. Lambert has shown faith by offering him a 2-year contract, his last chance to impress. Should he reach his mooted potential he will prove invaluable to Villa as a dogged midfielder with creativity and the odd goal. He is still young, but must deliver this season.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Jack Grealish* - The England FA will be keeping a close eye on the young Irish winger. He is yet to declare for either national side, but arrives into the Villa first-team riding a wave of hype and expectation after a successful loan spell at Notts County. He has shown glimpses of his quality in Villa's pre-season friendlies so far. His lack of defensive contribution and a naive attitude will not endear him to Keane, but his close dribbling and turn of pace will make him an invaluable asset if Lambert persists with his preferred counter-attacking style. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Darren Bent* - Yes, this guy is still around. You might have missed him on loan at Fulham last season, he didn't do much. Often the target of Lambert's chagrin, Bent was ostracized for a perceived lack of effort disproportional to his weekly wage. He has been recalled to act as cover and add some depth. With Kozak and Benteke on their way back from serious injuries, Bent has been given one last chance to rekindle his career. Entering the final year of his contract, he certainly won't receive an extension at Villa. Instead, this is his chance to impress potential suitors. He saved Villa from relegation twice. He won't be as influential this time around, but he will add a different dimension to Villa's attacking play. Bent is a classic poacher, the kind who finishes attacking moves rather than participating in their build-up. He is not a target man. He cannot profit from long-balls, a favored tactic of Lambert. Bent needs service and hopefully, with Grealish and N'Zogbia in the fold, he will get it.

----------------------------------------------

*Jores Okore* - Simply put, we Villa fans are frothing at the mouth to see Okore and Vlaar in action together. It has shades of the glorious Mellberg-Laursen partnership from a few years ago.

------------------------------------------------

*Fabian Delph* - The star of Lambert's reign. Has finally come good after struggling with injuries.

----------------------------------------------------

*Alan Hutton* - A solid and unspectacular right-back who offers more physicality and all-round quality than Lowton. Undisciplined at times, Hutton needs to perform well this season to put himself in the shop window. His biggest contribution will be freeing up Bacuna to play in midfield.

--------------------------------------------------------

*Andreas Weimann* - Despite making the most appearances for Villa last season, Weimann was consistently awful. Abysmal. I mean, seriously, the guy was brutal. Things can only improve, surely.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

*Aleksander Tonev* - We're still not sure if this guy is actually a footballer. He might be a genius.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Summary:** The exiled have been recalled and the mercenaries have been recruited. We are priming ourselves for one more desperate season of struggle as we await a buyer. Once Randy Lerner sells up and leaves, things will improve. We may have already outstayed our welcome in the Premier League. Relegation might be on the cards. Don't be surprised, though, if we cruise to a comfortable mid-table finish. This team has a wealth of untapped potential.

Let's see...the pickets state 'isolate and boycott israel'

So...based on that statement, they want to boycott all of Israel, presumably this includes everyone in Israel too, so all the Arabs (the majority of whom are Palestinian), Greek Orthodox and Christians should be included too...hmm nice, guess not all Palestinians are created equal in the eyes of protestors.  Also much like not everyone in the UK supports the government, so the same can be applied to the population of Israel.

Secondly how far does the boycott extend? Are we going to go for the whole shebang or just the stuff that suits us?  If we go the whole shebang, maybe we should stop using computers, because windows and intel are partially developed by Israel and well some of the money made by them goes to the Israeli government. Should we boycott produce too? It says grown in Israel so must be bad right? Who gives a toss if it was actually grown by Palestinians who have chosen to live in Israel.  Who gives a toss that it's going to be some labourer or business owner who suffer the brunt of the loss in sales, the government suffering...yeah not so much.

Now what about all those other pesky countries around Israel? Are we going to boycott Egypt since part of the wall around Gaza is on their side and built by them? What's stopping Egypt from providing refuge or stepping in...oh yeah they don't give a shit.  Then there is Lebanon and Jordan, they're Arab countries, surely they should help their fellow readers of the Quran right? Sadly they don't give a crap either, they may hate Israel but they dislike Palestinians that little bit more.

Its easy to forget that in Lebanon, the Palestinians barely have rights and refugees will end up in ""refuge camps"" which are more or less glorified concentration camps where the shitheads of the Lebanese army use the refugees for target practice.  The same applies to Jordan, Palestinians there may make up half the population but they only get half the rights of everyone else.

Finally, have these protestors been to Israel/Gaza or do they just have friends in Gaza?  The opinions of the Palestinian and Israeli populations are generally very different to those of Gaza and the government.  They also tend to differ from the opinions shown on TV.  Believe it or not, what you see on the news isn't representative of a country, heck sometimes it isn't even true.  Watching TV i can see why it's easy to vilify a country, so far we've seen the Israeli equivalent of the BNP/Trailer trash and the opinions of the ultra orthodox, whom quite frankly even other Israelis and Jews think they are retarded oiks.  It's like saying Scotland is a shithole and proving this by only interviewing the SNP and a bunch of junkies, of course nobody is going to think highly of Scotland after that. 

So in all if you are going to boycott, do it properly and with valid reason  or not at all. ",0,1406818742,null,0,false,0,cjd12un,t3_2c7szv,t1_cjd12un,t1_cjcvlv7,null,1434991859,-8,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,-8

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; It may be subjective from the point of view of the people in their area of influence, but from the perspective of an outside observer, like us, it is not.

That's basically what subjectivism: differing interpretations by people based upon individual factors. To say it's not subjective for someone, but it is for others (e.g. one group may hold one opinion, but another group another) is basically saying it's subjective. 

I get what you're saying, that over here, we should all think it's wrong seize power through force. And I do, and a lot of people do. But ""us"" (as in people in the UK) includes people who follow religions from that area, and have family in that area, and are perfectly justified and permitted to hold beliefs from that area. But they're not okay to act like the people in that area might (E.g. violence and aggression).

&gt; There may be a few people with extreme views who view ISIS as freedom fighters, but the question we have to ask ourselves is is it good for society that people are condoning their actions, and the overwhelming response would be no.

Is it detrimental to our society having people condoning those actions? I can't see how it is. Is it detrimental to lock people up or punish people for holding an (albeit controversial) viewpoint? I'd say yes it is, because it hinders open discourse and having the means in place to facilitate that is opening innocent people up to abuse from authorities (like abuses of the terrorism act).

&gt; There are lots of actions that we as a society find so appalling that we make it a crime to even suggest doing them, things like murder and rape, for good reasons, so why should we not also find the idea of supporting a group who commit these crimes and worse bad enough to make it a crime.

I believe it's illegal to conspire, or plan to murder or rape, or incite violence just as it's illegal to conspire to blow things up or murder people for your beliefs. 

But it's not illegal to hold the opinion that murder is or can be justified, or to hold the opinion that rape is or can be justified. Personally, I don't think either can be justified, but it's certainly not a crime to hold those beliefs, or fly a particular flag.

AFAIK, the only instances where such behaviour is illegal is under the controversial Terrorism Act which bans supporting a list of terror groups. As someone else pointed out, ISIS isn't a terror group, it more a collection of little groups with a shared aim of and Islamic state, but some of the terror groups associated with ISIS probably are on the list of banned groups.

But honestly, when Daniel Craig was on screen (I say DC because they showed Myers and God but the camera began to zoom in on Craig) the entire stadium was louder than for Yaya. I mean, I know he's James Bond and all, but the couple of city fans that were around me were cheering pretty loudly too. Was funny.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;Extremists by the very nature are a minority view , just because they exist doesn't mean society needs ""fixing"", especially when the fix for this minority view means restrictions on rights we all have.

By that logic a view that was considered extreme now would cease to be so once it was accepted by the majority of the population. While that might be true, the point is to stop these sorts of views from spreading. 

If someone holds an extreme view, and the only thing that is used to combat it is some harsh words, then there is a very good chance they will not change their mind. What happens if they have children and pass those views on to them? especially if they live in an insular community, with little exposure to the wider society?

&gt;Extremism can , and has been, countered at a local level with education and social programs ect.

I'm sure it can, but at the moment it is failing miserably to do so. Nearly a [third](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/29/thinktanks.religion) of young British Muslims believe that people who leave Islam should be executed. Almost 40% said that they would prefer to live under sharia law. The number of people who hold these views is growing. Will they be acceptable views once it is held by the majority?

In my opinion, if he hadn't have left Anfield, I believe he wouldn't have had the opportunity for an 'express' hearing at all. It's just angered me so much that it happened at the biggest sporting event in the world - and FIFA took immediate action, with a strict ban, which pretty much evoked a 'he deserved it' mentality among a majority of the fans, but less than three months after the Cup - the ban is almost non-existent.

Huntlelaar is only priced at 12m Euro's and Kissling at 11m. They are both 30 years old, they aren't going to be expensive. They will help us out for another 1-2 seasons, until a more experienced obvious striker arrives. Like a Hueng Min Son if he keeps it up.

Dzeko for 25m isn't a bad price considering we bought Schurrle (who was intended to be a 2nd choice) for 22m. And Willian who was supposed to be back up to Oscar/start on the wing for 30m.

Timo is a fine prospect, he can be on our squad and loaned out elsewhere and we can just deal with our current strikers, which i said earlier i was fine with keeping. 

El Shaarawy can play CF, nobody is stuck into a single position these days. I don't see why you would say that. Just like Cavani plays LW/RW at PSG, doesn't mean he still isn't a striker. Di Maria played ""best"" at RW until Carlo said play CAM and he turned into a fucking super saiyan. Position changes are a part of football, a position isn't stopping us from getting a player. PS. he is only priced at 20m at the moment. Meaning if we can spend the extra 10-15m to get him. If they miss UCL play again this year, it could be a possibility that he would want to leave. Which, imo their pre-season has been shitty, so things aren't looking like they are turning around.

I'm not sure if people just focus on his penalties, but that isn't the real story. The real story is he is 34, his legs are nowhere near what they once were, and he's a huge liability defensively. He cannot cover the ground, be that offence, or defence, and we have to carry him. You have all these young players, and Gerrard who just can't keep up.

This 4-3-3 with Gerrard launching long balls isn't how a team like ours should play, either. He just can't contribute enough. I think we'd also struggle with him in a two in a 4-2-3-1. Lucas has regressed a lot, but even he can perform much better in that role.

Ever since he's joined, he has always been expected to carry the team in the same way he did at Liverpool. Even with Eto'o, Torres never became the obvious backup striker, we still relied on him very heavily to deliver. I think he struggled with that thought (especially with the media reporting on his failure so heavily). He's not stupid, he knows he's not playing well and that probably creeps into his head every time he touches the ball.  

So maybe having the spotlight on Costa will help Torres regain some of his form? Maybe allowing him to come into the game in lower pressure situations will allow him to relax and just play his game? If he gets just a little more clinical, we will have 2 pretty dangerous backups. 

Again, probably wishful thinking..",0,1406822167,null,0,false,0,cjd2vym,t3_2c8fdx,t1_cjd2vym,t3_2c8fdx,null,1434992602,19,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,19

Its always good to save, and ignore the current prices. My personal belief is they will correct and drop by a good amount over the next few years. 

You could then consider moving to the commuter belt. In surrey prices appear to be dropping by a good amount. There are some nice schools and that area and very low crime rates. If your company can do 'london and waiting' you would be able to commute in.

Funny enough I did the same move myself when my first was born. I was inner city living and enjoyed it. But as soon as my first daughter was born I just did not like her and my wife walking around in the pram with special brew heads and junkies hanging around. We upped and left. 

I am yet to own, but I am hoping lady luck turns fortunes and prices come down, so us who are starting out, can get a family home, instead of the boomers making even more for their retirement.

true,TheHoneyThief,null,null,"The Sale of Goods and Services act covers second hand cars as much as anything else, as it should be in reasonable condition and fit for purpose.

Your car is not.

Step one is to get what you can fixed under warranty. Car warranties are tricky things, and mostly do not cover items classed as consumables (things that are changed throughout a car's lifespan, such as fluids, brake pads and discs, clutch, etc...) as well as other, more expensive things, like the ECU. So break out the warranty and see what's covered. Then, see who the warranty is with.

Step two: If the warranty is with a third party company, then see what they can do. If it's with the garage, then ask them to repair whatever is covered with the warranty, as the sale of goods act states that you have to give the garage a chance to rectify the issues encountered.

Step three: If they start getting cagey, call the Citizen's Advice Bureau. They'll tell you to reject the car and provide proof that you are doing so in writing. Follow their instructions to the letter.

Step four: If they ignore you in the hope that you will go away, go to court. If a judgment is made against them which they refuse to abide by, you can apply for a high court writ, which is then enforced by high court officers (bailiffs acting on behalf of a court with all kinds of legal powers including ability to seize assets, etc...)

If you look at Manchester City and even Chelsea - even their second team is good enough to qualify as a first team squad - they have that depth in the middle. 

I feel as if we haven't attacked our main issue from last season, which was out defense, really. Rodgers has done a fantastic job of deepening the squad in the middle for PL, but he had approximately 15 days before the season starts and we need defenders. 

Sakho and Škrtel are looking like the most prominent CB's. Škrtel scored the most goals for a defender last season, given at least two were in our net, but regardless - he's not a pushover and isn't afraid to move up. Sakho proved what he wanted to in his first season, during the World Cup. He's proven he has the fire and the aggression to fight against the other top players that might attack.

Lovren is definitely going to be grabbing some major game time, whether it be in the Premier League or the Champions League, he is definitely going to have an impact. His head is at Liverpool and he has something to prove. 

Can is definitely going to be a dark horse this season. I don't think many feel threatened by him but being honest he's my favorite signing so far - he's pacey and dangerous with the ball in the middle, I want to see him work wonders. 

Lallana and Markovic are pretty much equal on the scale. I can see Markovic grabbing more Premier League time than Champions League, with Lallana the same but with more in Champions League. The only setback here is Lallana is injured and will be out for a while. Markovic is still young and budding, I want to see him prove himself this season. 

Lambert, in all honesty, is not that young, and though he has the fight and aggression to play in the forward role, I don't think he has the pace that Sturridge/Sterling do up front. I can see him getting a bit of Premier League time, but wouldn't be surprised if I see him on the bench from time to time.

I've also seen the same things for stuff like healthcare (the new Scottish MEP said he supported the NHS, whereas Paul Nuttal has written stuff supporting full on privatisation), and other issues. This means that UKIP can target as many people as possible, as long as those people are willing to pick and choose what UKIP politicians they will listen to or ignore, and avoid answering tough questions.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"Everton under Moyes have been very dodgy in terms of picking up after bad results, which tended to lead towards really, really shitty runs. In the popular media we have always been considered a team that started shitty, but that was only the case about 4-5 or so of the seasons he was in charge (I say only, that is 4-5 too many, but we were spoke about as the team who *always* had a bad start).

We almost always have a shit xmas, but that is due to fixture congestion and lack of depth (no one to blame for that, as it was a product of our tiny budget)- but when we had a good start, we usually finished poorly. 

There were things Moyes did well, and some he didn't. He was famous for a Victorian style coaching method, where he would make the team do cross country runs and grueling stamina games. This led to amazing fitness levels (just look at Baines and how he improved his work rate under Davie), and a surprisingly low injury rate (we had one of the lowest injury rates in the year, partly due to a small squad though)- but it also meant that players would burn out quicker, and be far less fresh pre season. 

There was an amazing discussion with Bobby earlier in the year where he essentially slated this approach (look up the Everton Tea Party if you want to listen). He said 'certain managers' (no guesses who) ignore science, where he embraces it. All players now train only with the ball at their feet- which is great because they not only improve ball skills, but they work harder because they are doing something they love and it improves the muscle groups you use when playing football, so their fitness test levels were actually up. 

We had some bad results last year, but no real bad runs as such. We tended to bounce back a lot better- and I hope that continues through this year, because it is one of the main things that cost us back in that era.

Whitby is also really good, but if it's raining it's a bit miserable. If it's sunny though, it's fantastic. I would also say Knaresborough. It's small and quaint, but makes a good starting point for exploring and going on walks (visit Brimham Rocks!). It's really close to Harrogate, and not far from York as well.

Also, I know you said North Yorkshire, but Haworth in West Yorkshire is really worth a visit.

It matters because you're forming a definition entirely on your own and trying to use it to determine who other people that you don't know are and what they're about.

I don't think it's more than that and I don't see why you would arrive at that point. Now you're implying that because they use a phrase that's also used elsewhere, that they're not happy with their level of support. You're literally speaking on behalf of the intentions and feelings of the worldwide Liverpool support basis, as this usage here is not unique to Americans by any means.

It's not 'why so many of us need to be considered the same' - you're the only one making the distinction that there's a difference between American supporters and local ones. The only difference is where they cheer from. Being different is by no means a bad thing, agreed - but you're the only one who seems to need to point out that there are differences, the only one you *can* point out is geography, and it doesn't justify determining who can and cannot rightfully use a phrase that wasn't created by you. You don't really have any reason or right to attempt to govern a phrase, let alone one coined to regard away-from-home-support.

Who's stance has been derailed? I've had the same one and since we started discussing it, many have joined in my opinion, it seems. Your callousness was unnecessary, and I'm glad you acknowledge that. But you have very little to argue your point with, most of it is just your opinion. You're still clinging to your own definition of a phrase as the backbone of your argument, which is also an opinion and about the usage of a phrase determined only by you. 

You're still clinging to the definition you coined for 'it means people who sat in the Kop and traveled to away games'. You don't know who sat in the Kop and who didn't. Unless you go ask for ticketstubs of every person at every game outside of Anfield..you have absolutely no basis for a point here, lol. People here are seemingly in agreement with this and are also joining me in wondering why it even matters to you. Now you've generalized Americans in order to hopefully bolster the premise of us apparently ruining things for others in one way or another (not a direct quote, I know) but the reality is that most people would probably feel honored/brotherhood to know that people all around the world go this far to enjoy the same things they do. 

If RBNY had international support like Liverpool, I would be immensely thankful to those abroad who wanted to do anything we do here or model their support/behaviors off of our own. It would literally be a massive honor to see a locally based club have that kind of reach. You seem to feel the precise opposite, which nobody else seems to understand.

I'm really hoping that you see that at this point.

That is quite the stretch.  Reddit is not the world, this thread especially.  

&gt; Now you're implying that because they use a phrase that's also used elsewhere, that they're not happy with their level of support.

Is that not a fair assumption?  It's a global game, and with global support, a certain bit of appropriation comes with it.

&gt; You're literally speaking on behalf of the intentions and feelings of the worldwide Liverpool support basis, as this usage here is not unique to Americans by any means.

The bit on the phrase was a jumping off point.  I have moved on.

&gt; you're the only one making the distinction that there's a difference between American supporters and local ones.

Yes?  Is there not?  I've said numerous times different does not equal worse.  But pretending to be something else is disingenuous.

&gt; The only difference is where they cheer from.

Well that's just not true.  That's extremely naive.

&gt;  the only one you can point out is geography

Wait what?!?  The way it is intertwined in the culture, the way it can be discussed in public, overall knowledge of the peers.  The EPL is intertwined in English culture; it is not here.  It is extremely different.  WHy are you trying to argue for sameness?

&gt; and it doesn't justify determining who can and cannot rightfully use a phrase that wasn't created by you.

I acknowledged you were right on this several times.  I was wrong.  Why do you keep bringing it up?

&gt; Who's stance has been derailed?

whoa.  It was a hypothetical.  I was saying that if my salty language was derailing someone what does it say about them?  AKA criticizing my demeanor says more about you and your arguments than me and mine.

&gt;  But you have very little to argue your point with, most of it is just your opinion.

I thin that is an understatement.  But isn't this topic involving opinions by nature?

&gt; You're still clinging to your own definition of a phrase as the backbone of your argument,

smh... I stopped that like 8 comments ago.

&gt; You're still clinging to the definition you coined for 'it means people who sat in the Kop and traveled to away games'.

No I'm not.

&gt; People here are seemingly in agreement with this and are also joining me in wondering why it even matters to you.

An appeal to public opinion does not make me wrong, and I have stated why it matters to me.

&gt; Now you've generalized Americans in order to hopefully bolster the premise of us apparently ruining things for others in one way or another

It was fairly clear I was generalizing.  And never was I inferring ""all"" Americans.

&gt; but the reality is that most people would probably feel honored/brotherhood to know that people all around the world go this far to enjoy the same things they do. 

It's ironic this is the second half of a clause criticizing me for generalizing

&gt; I would be immensely thankful to those abroad who wanted to do anything we do here or model their support/behaviors off of our own

I think there is a lot to be said here about sentiments that come with being American as opposed to those from other places.  Never was I implying Liverpudlians condemn international support, but there is something to be said about the usurpation of one's culture.  I think being an American, you are a bit oblivious to how American's are percieved, how they/we tend to rebrand everyone else's culture as our own.

&gt; It would literally be a massive honor to see a locally based club have that kind of reach. 

Red Bulls New York has been around for what?  Less than a decade?  Liverpool over a century?  Your comparison is naive.

Defenders, particularly goalkeepers and central defenders, aren't positions that managers want to rotate. If possible, managers want to keep the same pair of CBs together every game for a multitude of reasons; it builds chemistry, provides stability, etc.. 

I like Coates, but if we kept him we would have Skrtel, Sakho, Lovren, Kolo, and him (assuming Agger leaves). Of those, he would probably be fourth choice, and as a defender the most important way to improve is through experience by playing games. This is especially the case for Coates since he grew up playing CB in Uruguay, where the defensive schemes are much different than in England. The only games he is going to get are going to be Cup games or if we have a huge injury crises.  I don't think it's fair to him to have to sit on the bench the whole season.

I think unfortunately he'll probably get sold, but I hope instead we send him on loan to another club in the Premier League.

I was never generalizing every American?  Maybe I did not expel enough of my meaning, but I thought it was obvious I was talking about a certain type of supporter.

I personally just get in the right hand lane and speed past, assuming its safe to do so. Maybe give a little toot as i'm passing if i'm feeling adventurous (after a quick look to check the driver doesn't look like a psychopath).

No..it's not? How are you in a position to determine how happy anyone is..? Let alone someone/an entire body of people you don't even know..?

'Moving on' sort of amounts to not responding to the question. Doesn't make what you said any more reasonable, accurate or correct.

You, again, are making this determination of people 'pretending to be something they're not'. You are alone in this opinion. It is supported by 0% fact. Understand this, please.

Again, just stating that something isn't true and offering an opinion on my personality offers absolutely no explanation for how you arrived at this point. At the very least, provide a single other difference that isn't just your opinion. 

I'm not arguing for sameness of culture, but you're talking about *people*, these people's *intentions* and insisting that  they're less happy and are out to copy others. This is delusional and doesn't need disproving because neither I nor you are in a position to determine that regarding people we don't know. 

I disagree, because I'm criticizing them with excessive fact and example in addition to my opinion. You're, in the majority of these cases, are just saying I'm wrong and that what your opinion is, is.

I bring it up only in response to you exemplifying that despite acknowledging this, your argument stems from the same opinions that you've already agreed are incorrect.

Yes, it is, but the topic isn't our difference of opinions, it's you insisting that yours is correct and mine is not. You're comparing our opinions like they are facts, but only one of us is offering any sort of fact. I'm also the only one really making comparisons to other things that are identical in their point's basis, where you are generalizing - which is the wrong thing to do in almost every case. In this case, when you're talking about the specific emotions of people, the reasons they do things and how they want to be viewed (not how they are viewed, but how they in their own minds would prefer to be viewed, something which is unique to the individual and cannot be generalized), it offers very little to anything to think that you're in a position to do so.

If you're not clinging to that, I fail to see what points you're bringing to the table anymore, other than just picking apart my replies line by line to disagree with them.

You stated your perverse generalized opinion of American culture. An appeal to public opinion is an attempt to see you cast even a shred of doubt in how you're forming these opinions. Much of what you're telling me are things one simply cannot know, let alone use to support an argument based on generalizations and opinion.

Now you're just arguing semantics. But, you at least acknowledge that you're generalizing. I don't know why, and I don't know why you find that it serves as any sort of evidence to support your opinions. Generalizations like those which you've made are part of the reason why American soccer culture is the way that it is. It's always easier to generalize, and obviously depending on the topic at hand, almost always extremely inaccurate. 

The difference is, my generalization is actually accurate and I say it based on the wealth of info/cases out there which are readily accessible to all. Like I said, google some images. The whole concept of support is about embracing something, and when people link arms to do it together..it's generally approved of and the preferred behavior. I think there are a lot of people who would be very upset to hear the opinions you've offered here and would prefer not to be associated with you as a result of it. The most minor example of this is the up and downvotes throughout our discussion. Notice all of your negative votes. People clearly disagree with you. You're basically flipping them all off saying ""nope."" You're entitled to your opinion, of course, but when it's sort of blatantly just..incorrect..you have to eventually doubt it. 

If we're both Americans, how can you tell me that I'm oblivious to how American's are perceived because I'm American..if you're American and talking about how we're perceived. I mean, wtf. You can't go explaining something to someone you say doesn't get it because of qualities you share. Also, you have no idea if I'm born and raised abroad and living here now. But that doesn't stop you from not implying but directly telling me that I *am* a bit oblivious. 

Again, calling me naive? It was an example of how I would feel about foreign support for my local club. It's not about whether or not RBNY would actually *get* to the level that Liverpool is, in terms of support. The fact that you missed this one is sort of appalling, and further speaks on behalf of the view that you seem to be here more to stick it to people than to offer anything else.

I'm done though. You've made it extremely clear that you're very comfortable talking about things you know nothing about. You seem to think you have all the answers, even when they're about what goes on inside the heads of complete strangers, myself included.  You're not using my words to accurately respond to my words, at this point, you're just trying to say what things 'are' and leave very little (read: no) room for you potentially not knowing wtf you're talking about.

The sheer fact that it has to be explained to you that you can't say ""they do that because they're not as happy' or that these people are pretending to be something..speaks on behalf of whether or not I'm talking to a rational person here. That alone is a very, very fundamental and basic concept. You're not in anyone's head. You don't know why they do what they do unless they say so. Nobody flew a banner that said ""YEAHHH, WE'RE JUST EXACTLY LIKE THE SCOUSERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE AIMING FOR, WE DID IT AND WE'RE ALMOST AS HAPPY AS THEM NOW WOOOO"" or anything even remotely close. Arriving at vastly different concepts from the same information which nobody else agrees with and that you can't actually prove..speaks for itself.

Good luck.

true,d3pd,null,null,"&gt;Do you force women to have abortions?

What? It goes without saying that that would be horrible. Just think about this as you would a driving licence.

You're not permitted to drive unless you have a licence. Most people obey this rule and it is quite reasonable. Similarly, you could say that you're not permitted to raise a child unless you are qualified to do so. This is no different to the rationale behind assessing prospective adoptive parents.

Ok, so someone gets pregnant and has a kid. Unless a qualified psychologist thinks the kid is in mortal danger, there's no urgent issue here. The state simply requires the parents to undergo training and evaluation to ensure that they meet the minimum standards of being able to care for the child.

It would be in the most extreme circumstances only that a child would be removed from really unqualified parents -- and this is something that is done already by child protective services.

Does this approach not seem entirely reasonable to you?

Do you support assessment of prospective adoptive parents? Why/why not?",1,1406832520,null,0,false,0,cjd8snd,t3_2c8lbq,t1_cjd8snd,t1_cjd8f7e,null,1434995628,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

I may bash Osman, but the great thing about him, is that he can hold his own in almost any mid position.  He's not near regular starting quality for me anymore, but he'd be great for giving other players rest and used as a sub.  

I'm sure that we'll bring Traore back on loan this season because he didn't play much at all last season, and he'll want more first team experience so that should cover us in striker, and even naisy can fill in if need be (he wasn't all bad at all last year in that role).

Some youth players will give us additional depth that we need and I think we're pretty well set for a good season this year.  I'm not expecting the same type of league finish as last season, especially when the other teams have spent so damn much, but still 6-8 finish, and I want us in the quarter/semis of each of the domestic cups, and to get to the round of 16 in Europa.

At a young age it is huge. A 16 year old who isn't even done growing yet compared to a far more fully grown man in Bamford? Seriously? Then you compare Messi and Heskey to prove that you didn't even attempt to read my point.

You also seem to completely jump over what I said. Let's read it again shall we?

&gt;I wouldn't worry about him drifting out of games yet, let's get him on a team we can watch week-in and out then we'll talk.

My point was that let's see him get on a top team and see how he does. Not that he doesn't drift out of games, I just want to see what he does when he gets put on a top team and how he preforms.

There's a fair point in that some the geology in Cumbria is not the most suitable, but there's enough that is that means the disposal facility will most likely go ahead. Transporting the waste elsewhere would be even more costly, because of the risks involved (and also it takes ages).

What I know of research is that they want to make absolutely certain that what waste there is is immobilized, so that it can't escape from the containers its stored underground. But I only covered it briefly in the course I did (1 lecture from someone involved in the area), and information on the net is somewhat scant, perhaps obviously.

Yup, I mentioned this in a couple of threads (walker-peters &amp; carter vickers and Onomah).

Honestly, just think about this as you would a driving licence.

You're not permitted to drive unless you have a licence. Most people obey this rule and it is quite reasonable. Similarly, you could say that you're not permitted to raise a child unless you are qualified to do so. This is no different to the rationale behind assessing prospective adoptive parents.

So, what happens when someone gets pregnant and has a kid without being confirmed as qualified to care for a child? Well, unless a qualified psychologist thinks the kid is in mortal danger, there's no urgent issue here. The state simply requires the parents to undergo training and evaluation to ensure that they meet the minimum standards of being able to care for the child.

It would be in the most extreme circumstances only that a child would be removed from really unqualified parents -- and this is something that is done already by child protective services.

I've done two threads on our youth players, one on [Nathan Oduwa](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2bz6me/youth_watch_nathan_oduwa/) here and one on [Harry Winks here](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2bzbk6/youth_watch_harry_winks/)

He told in his exit interview he was almost gonna stay for one more series when he learned moffat took over as the show-runner, but he reminded himself of his promise to himself.

For Matt, he and moffat were always talking about 50th and christmas special in 2013 and the rest was up to the persuasiveness of the moffat. Sadly enough, it wasn't enough, Matt told he thought he had courage to leave the show and if he were to do another series he might never leave Doctor Who(well probably not never but for a long time). Hence he quit while he could.

As for Eccleston, there are lots of stories about him. Some says he and BBC agreed just for a year and they all knew he was gonna leave after the series. However he later declared the crew was badly treated by seniors of the show and there were ceative differences between him and the creators and also he didn't want to be a typecast. Although i think that he was gonna leave anyway at the end of his first year, it may not have been this bad and he could've returned for 50th.

&gt;What I'm getting at is that we require licences and qualifications for jobs that are technical or involve having a great responsibility over others.

Manager in IT. Only have GCSE's. You really don't need qualifications to get a decent job. You need experience and a good attitude.

&gt;We require driving licences because driving is a somewhat technical subject, requiring some education, and driving involves care to prevent harm or suffering coming to people. We don't let just anyone be in charge of, say, a nuclear reactor, because without the proper know-how, serious harm could be done to people. We require training, and strict background checks on teachers because they are in a position of critical trust and are involved in the care of vulnerable people.

Where you're going with this is hilarious. Good troll.

There are 3 lanes (A, B, C). A being the lane to the left, B the middle lane and C the fast lane on the right.
The lane A is completely empty. On the lane B there is a car driving 50mph for example, and on the lane C there is a steady stream of cars going 85 mph (This is by the way where I would personally be, but that's not important here).

You approach the car in the middle lane going 65 mph. The driver doesn't see you, doesn't care, &lt;insert whatever other bullshit reason&gt;. What do you do?

If you go on the lane A and overtake (undertake) him, you break the law. If you go on the lane C to overtake him, you will merge into 85 mph traffic and break the speed limit. 

I don't think I can make it any more clear.

Now, coming back to your rant. The fact that you don't care what the speed limit is doesn't make you a good driver. Quite opposite, actually. Do you not think better drivers are aware what the speed limit is, and if they decide to go faster, it's because they've made a decision and not because they didn't know what it was.

I went to my match yesterday, with not having had the opportunity to have done so before, and let me tell you, yesterday was an experience that validated why I love this club so much.

Despite playing away from home in another country, the enthusiasm and togetherness of the fans present was something to truly behold. People of all colors, gender and origins congregating to sing many a song about the feats of our accomplishments, and tributes to our legends while enjoying a pint.  It truly underlined our motto ""You'll Never Walk Alone"". We made a march to the stadium as one, and it couldn't have been a starker contrast to the City fans. They walked alone, or in small groups, few and rare in number; fans who were aware of the club's success in the past few years, but unfamiliar with it's history or culture. It never vindicated my decision to become a Liverpool fan more. The match was another experience altogether. Singing the You'll Never Walk Alone for the very first time in a stadium. Seeing the resilience of the team to fight back from being a goal down twice to level the proceedings , playing the good flowing football that Rodgers has induced, and the moments of thrill experienced when the team suddenly switched from defence to attack in a split second. Experiencing the thrill of a penatly shootout was an added bonus, something you don't experience that often in friendlies. Mignolet won us the game with some good goalkeeping and I left a very happy, fulfilled fan. It was just, plain Awesome.

Then surely it's not the same flag. Saudi Arabia's flag and the ISIS flag are very obviously different, even if they have the shahada on both of them. You can show a flag with the Shahada on it if you want, but flying the exact flag ISIS use as their banner is completely different to wanting to show your belief/love of your gods and prophets. Flying the exact design of the ISIS flag says only one thing. 


But it's a bit of a moot point, considering I didn't actually see the ISIS flag in the video. Though the flag in the video does look remarkably similar to the flag of the Taliban.

Like most opponents of Rahman, your criticisms are always - overtly or not - composed in the language of racism, in this case you are being overtly racist. 

When we actually look at what you're talking about, i.e. ""groups of people at the polling stations"", there's very little abnormal about that. It's not illegal to persuade people to vote for you, and to do so on the streets, by intimidating you mean leafletting or asking people. 

Labour party candidates came to my door several times, yet if it has been Rahman supporters one can imagine your outrage and the headlines in the newspapers of *“intimidating gangs targeting peoples homes to get them to vote”* shock horror. All parties leaflet, and all do so with the line that your should vote for them. But as your masters in the media command you paradoxically hold Rahman to a higher standard, and like The Standard, endlessly repeat the hearsay, biased and slanderous claims of Labour Candidates and their wild accusations without any context or questioning. 

So deep is the hatred that for Rahman's supporter to take the 'radical' step and instruct people to vote for him, is constructed as some kind of crime...of course the other parties never ask people to vote for them

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"Definitely Eriksen and Lloris I'd say.  The former is a no-brainer.  The latter had some tough games last season when we capitulated to big teams, but I'd be surprised to see that happen again with the same level of frequency this year.  He's still one of the top 2-3 keepers in the league.

As for the final slot, tough pick between Lamela, Adebayor and Walker I reckon.  Walker is a nailed-on starter for us, arguably more than the other two.  He'll always play if fit, and he usually is.  The fact that he'll be given license to bomb forward this season means he'll get involved in attacking plays a lot, which should boost his numbers (depending on how they score it).

Adebayor is a less dependable player, but if he can continue his form from last season would also be an obvious choice.  I'm just not sure about a) his fitness coming back from malaria, b) whether he'll be Poch's first choice over Soldado, and c) whether we'll see the Jekyll Ade or Hyde Ade this season.

Finally, Lamela would be a good bet, except that I think he'll need a bit of time to adjust, has a lot of psychological baggage to get over, and I'm not sure whether he'll start alongside Eriksen.  I actually feel like Poch might bench him for the first month and use him as a sub until he's fully match fit and accustomed to the league.  We're all expecting great things from him this year...

* why is that controversial? When did supporting a people under siege, defending the defenceless, and supporting peoples right to self-determination become controversial? The council isn't a neutral political apparatus, it's an elected body that possesses a partisan line, beliefs that were voted in and are being acted out.

* the mainstream media and the mainstream parties have all demonstrated their opposition to this popular elected mayor, and performed a smear campaign against him, despite both the police and CPS finding no laws broken (since usually the claims are made by interested parties, i.e. labour candidates)

* The racism that is so prevalent to appear normal contained within every attack upon Rahman is disgraceful. The fact that a non-white person getting elected to a leadership position is universally assumed to be 'identity politics', i.e. not because they possess any actual leadership skills or have served their community well, but because of their skin colour (i.e. a black person couldn't possibly possess any skill it must be their colour). Of course when a white person is elected no one ever assumes 'identity politics' based on colour but that they are simply good at their job. The people of Tower Hamlets are evidently fed up of self-serving labour leaders taking their votes for granted and doing nothing for the community they serve. Even if this was a case of 'identity-politics', perhaps locals are fed up with the white establishment supremacy and wish for someone who at least, on various levels, can share experiences and an understanding that has been missing. The fact that Rahman has connected and mobilised locals more to an unprecedented degree puts the norm to shame, the response of the mainstream to a large body of non-whites energies directed towards politcs has been fury, attacks that have only served to increase the energy of locals

Politics contains identity-politics because having politicians that are relatively like voters is always an issue because people don't inherently posses an ability to know what being 'x' is like, at best they can empathise, not experience, as such taking into account when voting that someone was born on a council estate or experiences state racism is a legitimate process",1,1406840328,null,0,false,0,cjdd8x5,t3_2c87bs,t1_cjdd8x5,t3_2c87bs,null,1434997752,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

There have been no major grid disturbances recently; your problem would have been due to a more local issue. Maybe someone fucked up and blamed the fire; maybe the fire somehow affected the distribution network.

For what it's worth, the majority of fires at power stations are caused by things like welding, electrical faults and improper lagging of hot plant, in combination with poor housekeeping and oil leaks. These are all much more likely during an outage, where many more people are around, hot work is being done, tests are being carried out, mistakes get made during maintenance and the plant is in an abnormal state. It's less common for a fire to break out during normal operations.

Coal stations in particular shut down over the summer because gas is cheap when nobody is using it for heating. You can see [here](http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/) that CCGTs (gas fired) are currently at over 14GW (a lot), despite demand being pretty low (33.7GW), and coal is only at 5GW compared to ~15GW in the winter.

I don't think he's ever looked that bad anytime I've seen him play.  There are things he's not good at- handling free kicks/corners, as an example, but he's not any worse at that than either Mignolet or Reina who are equally bad at it.  

His distribution isn't as good as Reina, but isn't any worse than Mignolet.  Shot blocking wise, he's not as good as Mignolet, but not much worse than Reina either.

Is he a world beater?  No.  Is he good enough for a backup position?  I think he is.  Doesn't cost much, doesn't cause drama, performs reasonably well.  These are three things that are hard to find when it comes to backup goal keepers.

What I would personally like to see is a new goalkeeping coach instead.

It is a very worrying thing to do, no matter how trustworthy they seem. While it's better than handing it over to ""ima bonk"" or ""bank419"". If things go wrong, what will you go back to your bank to say? ""I put all my login details you told me never to share into a website, and now things went badly somehow!""

Would you enter your email &amp; password for your amazon account into a website that was there to track your spending?

&gt; The problem is clearly with the banks. 

This is entirely irrelevant as to whether or not you hand your login details over to a third party. It's a massive shame they don't offer read only APIs with revokable keys (if they did, I'd love to use aggregators), but it has no bearing on whether or not it's a good idea to give your *personal write keys* to a third party!

Clause Dier promotes Semedo 
Has been somewhat surprising that Leonardo Jardim not be betting more on Eric Dier, however, according to the ""Daily News"", this lower use of center-back does not go through a phase of lower glow athlete or for the duration of the contract which, remember, ends in 2016. the problem actually pass by the termination clause of international under-21 English, because, at this point, any club can secure Eric Dier on payment of five million euros. 

Given this state of affairs, the ""DN"" said that Sporting will be alert, as this is a very low value, especially considering that there are already numerous English clubs to watch Eric Dier and financial power more than enough to such pay the five million euros. 

Reuben Semedo benefited 

Who will benefit from this situation was that Reuben Semedo to be in the ""pole position"" to fill the vacancy of Marcos Rojo in the game tomorrow, in Olhão, as hinted Leonardo Jardim at yesterday's press conference. ""The Dier has little rirmo because it still has barely played this season. Reuben Semedo We also already have some rhythm and had a good performance in the presentation of Sporting, against Fiorentina."" 

Interestingly, according to the ""DN"", Reuben Semedo was not even in the initial options Leonardo Jardim, just having conquered its space for the delay in hiring Mauritius, Madeira situation that forced the coach to make the group as the young and the be happy in such a way that no longer allowed the defense back to the source, keeping it working with the first team. 

Dier, on the other hand, has had little room this season, and their situation will only get back to normal with the signing of new bond, adding the ""DN"" that negotiations with Jeremy Dier, his father and agent, for wage revision and consequent expansion of the termination clause, has not been easy and that the parties are still far apart.",0,1406841055,null,0,false,0,cjddmuz,t3_2c9ygt,t1_cjddmuz,t3_2c9ygt,null,1434997900,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Typically a good day on the motorway for me is LH lane full of lorries, centre lane full of people driving at a normal speed (hopefully) overtaking the lorries. RH lane is full of nutters doing 100+ and trying to force each other off the road by aggressive tailgating.

Nobody in the centre lane is going to pull over after overtaking a lorry because they would be back out again 5 seconds later. Except you can't get back out because everyone in the middle lane is bumper to bumper. No point causing yourself problems just to be the only person on the road doing it right.

true,IndianGameDev,null,null,"Let's see how dumb is this argument. Last season, we had Torres, Ba and Eto'o to play for us. Lukaku needs at least 20 appearances, right? Could we have guaranteed that? If not, then Lukaku is fairly right to request a loan. A player should worry about his development too, apart from the club. Last season, he wouldn't have been given enough game time that he needs. Heck, we hardly played Ba either. No club needs 4 strikers for just one position. So, a loan made perfect sense for both Chelsea and Lukaku. 

Let's move on to this season. We have Costa, Torres and Drogba. Considering Costa is our marquee signing, expect him to start most games. So, Torres and Drogba will be used as sub or rotation in smaller games. If we add Lukaku in the mix, the best we can offer him is 10-15 appearances. If injuries happen, or if Lukaku finds great form, he might have played 20+ games. But, we can't guarantee that. So, it makes no sense for Chelsea to guarantee anything. 

But from the perspective of Lukaku, Everton is offering 40+ appearances, will use him as focal point of most attacks, and higher salary. On the contrast, Chelsea offers better coaching, chance to train with his idol, being a part of bigger team, lower wages, and no guaranteed game time. So, for him, it is either game time and more money vs training with bigger team. Considering his interest in football (even we don't watch all PL matches), it is perfectly fine that he chose game time. 

It is not that Lukaku said ""fuck Chelsea, I prefer everton"". He is thinking about his development first. And chances are, after 4-5 years, he might join us again, just like Matic did. 

So, don't get pissed off that Lukaku left. He was not the right option for us, we were not right option for him. No need to act like he is the biggest cunt ever. Maybe after a while, we will have Torres off-books, and Lukaku will sign with us to fight with Costa. For now, he wasn't interested in fighting with a 36 year old, and a player who can't score open goals from 2 yards. Him leaving permanently is the best option for now. 


TL;DR 

Transfer makes sense for both Chelsea and Lukaku. No reason to be pissed at Lukaku or Mourinho about it. ",0,1406841391,null,0,false,0,cjddt8z,t3_2c65on,t1_cjddt8z,t1_cjct805,null,1434997968,-1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-1

If you end up enjoying them enough that you want to forge a career out of that interest, you'll need your A-levels in them to study them at university. If it turns out that you don't, then you're still not a dead end--you can always drop your subjects and take an additional year to study something you think you'd prefer, or you can look for training or apprenticeships for jobs.

true,baddada77,lfc68,,"I was thinking about the fringe players last night while watching the game. 

GK: Mignolet is the obvious #1. If we can't find a taker for Reina he has to stay and be the Cup GK and see if he can pressure Mignolet into bettering his efforts from last year. Ward as 3rd GK. Release Jones. He isn't good enough and is an accident waiting to happen.

CB: Skrtel, Sakho and Lovren will rotate. Keep Kolo as veteran backup. Sell Agger. his time has come and we can make at least £12m from him. Wisdom has already been loaned. Sell Coates, he isn't going to cut it here. Ilori needs a loan to a Spanish side, Granada would be ideal. He forged a nice partnership at CB with a guy there last season (albeit in limited appearances). I forgot the guy's name.

Fullbacks: This really depends on whether we sign anybody. Let's say we conclude our transfer business and get in young Manquillo &amp; Moreno. If so I would jettison Robinson and Johnson. Robinson isn't good enough for the Prem IMO. Johnson has regressed badly and we will at least get a fee for him if we sell now. QPR are interested (£5m?) and it'll trim a high earner off the wage bill. Keep Enrique as Moreno's backup. Flanagan, Manquillo and Kelly can fight it out for the RB spot. Of course should we fail to sign any new fullbacks Johnson would have to stay. I would still sell Robinson though. Should Enrique get injured again we would have enough cover to cope at LB.

If Kelly doesn't cut it this season I'd expect him to be sold and for Wisdom to replace him in the squad. Young Smith can stick with the U21's or maybe see some time on loan. Same for McLaughlin.

Midfield: Nothing doing here for me at least not this summer aside from selling Coady on. He is a Championship player at best. I think this a make or break year for Lucas and Allen though. Both need strong seasons to secure their futures. If they struggle I could see both moving next summer with better players being brought in. Can could be the death knell for both these guys. He looks like just the strong presence we lacked at times last season.

CAM/Wing: I would keep both Suso and Teixeira around with the more experienced Suso probably earning more match time. If Teixeira has seen little action he could be loaned in January. I expect an important contribution from Suso this year. I don't think he will let us down. Ibe needs to go out on loan. I also hope Alberto has a strong season in Spain akin to Suso and returns ready for action next summer. Assaidi will hopefully conclude his move to Stoke.

Forwards: If we do sign another forward (Bony? Lacazette?) Borini would need to be moved on. He would need to be convinced the Sunderland move makes too much sense for everyone. I know BR wants 4 forwards but Sterling could always fill in as 4th choice striker if things got desperate. Sturridge, Lambert and Bony/Lacazette/??? would surely be enough. We will have Origi for next season.



edit: looks like my wish for Manquillo/Moreno is coming to fruition! This looks like great business.

It is the same thing as Adobe or Oracle offering you director's position, when Google isn't willing to increase your salary and keeping you as junior engineer. If that offer for Director's position is not there, you might stay as a junior engineer. An offer like that will always cause impatience. 

As for shortsightedness, you are far off there. Lukaku is gaining starting position, and higher salary just for going to a slightly smaller club. It is not as if he is moving to league 2 side. The amount of exposure Lukaku will get, he will definitely develop faster. And I am sure, you will love it when we sign him again 5 years later and he comes in to dethrone aging Costa. Chances of that happening is higher if Lukaku plays at Everton, instead of getting sub appearances at Chelsea. We don't want him to develop well and then sign for barca or Bayern for 60mil.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"BBC BASIC programming instructions.

As you didn't have an editor like notepad, that allowed you to easily have a 'carrot' where you could type text, delete text and the like, you would have line numbers.  This is why the numbers are at the begin.  Each ""line"" of code starts with a number, the first, by convention is 10, but it could just as easily be 01.  The next, is 20, this is so that if you need to add more, you've got 9 spare lines between every line you intended to write.

So the first line, number 10, says print, then the words *LOOK AROUND YOU *, print comes from bad language in old days, it really means show on the screen, or 'write' as more enlightened languages call it, this was the 80s a dark time, still shaped by the effects of glam rock.

BASIC programs start by running each line in order, the lowest to the highest, unless there is a control instruction, such as Go To, this instructs the program to run at line 10 next.

As such the program will just keep endlessly writing ""LOOK AROUND YOU "" to the screen, the trailing space is now important, without it, it would write LOOK AROUND YOULOOK AROUND YOULOOK... and so forth.

The last command, without a line number, means it's executed immediately.  RUN starts the program at the very first line.

The idea of increasing by 10 is very useful, as you don't have to modify anything, imagine you were writing them out on paper, you left 9 blank lines between every statement.  Someone says ""Oh Mr TheAnimus, this is great and everything, but we wanted it to say JUST between every Look Around You.""  You wouldn't have to re-write anything, you would inject a line, using that blank space

    11 PRINT ""JUST "";

Whilst in an example with only two lines, you wouldn't object to re-writing the whole thing, imagine you had a few thousand lines.

Edit: unless you were asking about the program, in which case it was a BBC comedy from 10+ years ago, it was awesome, and this was the program that they showed in the intro.",0,1406842947,null,0,false,0,cjdem21,t3_2c9h7n,t1_cjdem21,t1_cjde880,null,1435005350,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

This is a pointless argument when considering whether or not you should use them now.

&gt; Banks need to accept that and either make this a reality or amend their T&amp;Cs to be clear on the use of aggregators.

Banks don't need to allow aggregators, they need to supply read only APIs. It's a shame they don't, but that doesn't protect you. 

You are completely free to hand over your details to whoever you want, but if things go wrong you can't complain to your bank that their terms and conditions aren't lenient enough.

If you do this, and your bank explicitly tells you not to hand over all your login details, then you are unlikely to be protected.

Always remember the risk, (depending on your bank) you are entering you bank login details into a third party against the explicit terms and conditions of your bank.

Eriksen is a safe choice and Lamela is a good choice if you are going for differential, especially considering he's had a good pre-season (I personally have Lamela on my team)...

I usually don't pick 2 mids from the same team, especially at the beginning of the season, but there are cases where this is a good idea (Last year I had Yaya Toure and Silva for a few GWs). It's a don't-put-all-your-eggs-in-one-basket approach, but there's some bullshit in that. If 2 of the best mids are on the same team, then go for it, however this is not the case, IMO.

And Vertonghen? No way. First off, he's not cheap at all, actually the opposite at £6, which is on the expensive side for defenders. And, you generally want to pick full backs, that have more scoring potential than CBs. I would go with Davies who is .5 cheaper and is more of a scoring threat.

And one more thing, you can't let supporting Spurs cloud your vision in Fantasy. I personally only have 2 Spurs players on my squad and I have 1 gooner. You have to try to remain unbiased, but let you insight of your favorite team give you the advantage. Lamela is still very much a secret weapon in Fantasy, only on 2% of all fantasy teams.

I want us to think BIG. Spend 30-40 million on a player that we need. Either at CB or LW. Someone exciting. Someone that'll make people sit up and realise that we mean business. A statement of intent if you will.

I think our lack of net spending year after year is starting to make us look a little cheap.

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"&gt; Sure, every so often you might get a Benteke or a Seamus Coleman. When that happens you're going to profit immensely. **It's rare, though.**

Not really. Arsene Wenger literally built the Invincibles by picking up a few proven talents and supplementing them with guys nobody else knew about. It's all about the depth of your scouting network and overseas knowledge. There's no shortage of talent in these ""obscure European leagues"", it's just that most clubs don't look properly.

It's probably worth pointing out that Benteke wasn't the huge risk everyone seemed to think, either. He'd been rated fairly highly within Belgium already, and this is a nation which had several young talents emerging. He played for his country at every level from U17 up, and broke into the Belgium senior squad *before* we signed him. That's why Genk could ask for 7m and we accepted.

I also think you're being a bit harsh on the guys you mentioned. Luna I don't really rate as a fullback, but when he doesn't have to cover a winger man-to-man, he's alright. Helenius and Tonev haven't really been given a fair crack. Sylla did fine in his first season but looked to be lacking match practice last term. A bit early to be saying these guys don't have the ability to make it in the premier league, IMO. Especially since they're all under 25.

I get what you're saying, but it's too early to say it hasn't worked. We're still a Premier League team, and even with all these ""not good enough"" players, there were times last season where it looked like we'd finish comfortably mid-table. Injuries screwed us over, though.

I do think we can't rely solely on young players, and I've been saying this ever since Petrov retired. There was a huge drop off in the quality of play when he had to pack it in, and not because Stan is world class or anything. He was the stabilising influence, the anchor. You need experienced players to do that for young guys in their formative years.

true,Cheimon,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt;  The period was one of extremely slow progress on all levels because of religious oppression in Europe.

Most modern authorities on the early medieval period would fundamentally disagree with many parts of this sentence.  'Progression' fluctuates as it does in many other periods but it does not necessarily reach an extreme low point, with several prominent sections of progression as high as those before or after.  Not 'all levels' are affected similarly by the removal of the central Western Roman power structure.  'Religious oppression' seems an odd take because Europe is the seat of competing religions with very different views.  'Oppression' seems odd when the Christian Church did some of the most work to preserve learning and aristocratic culture in the entire period.  'Europe' also doesn't make a lot of sense when the situation so dramatically varies across time and space throughout the course of the period.

Any of these individual points can be effectively looked up and delved into.  The fact remains that ""Dark Ages"" is no longer accepted terminology by any modern historians of the period, and the associations it brings with it are so frequently false that it makes more sense to dish it than try to change the modern understanding.  Unless you qualify it with bizarrely narrowly defined terms it will not be a truthful descriptor of the early medieval period.

Unlike dialysis which actually filters things out more like a sieve, leaving the blood relatively unchanged otherwise, plasmapheresis involves centrifugation of the components and then taking away what you don't want.

But it's not as selective as dialysis, so you generally need to do away with more fluid, that will need to be replaced. Importantly it's likely that they lost important proteins in the blood like albumin, and if the replacement fluid includes albumin (which it more than likely will) it will be a blood-derived product and not necessarily acceptable to JW.

Your link is really helpful since it points out that JW would accept or be okay with albumin and individual components, however you have to remember that not every JW will have an as complete understanding of the salient details.

Once the tyre has done several thousand miles this results in a noise that sounds exactly the same as a failed wheelbearing. On my wife's Mitsubishi FTO its really bad with this as it runs a lot of negative camber. When we bought it I actually thought the rear wheel bearings were shot on the test drive and I used to be a mechanic. Its still running the same wheelbearings 7 years and 80,000 miles later. You put on new tyres, it shuts up for several thousand miles then slowly comes back. Swap fronts to rear, rinse and repeat.

There are two simple things you can do to eliminate this tyre wear as the cause:

1) Go for a long drive. Stop and feel the middle of each wheel. One with a worn wheelbearing will feel hotter than the other one on the same axle, i.e compare the front left to front right and rear left to rear right and not the front left to rear left etc as front brakes do more work than rears.

2) Swap the front and rear tyres.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"We're always fine for homegrown players in terms of having enough of them - can always make up those numbers with younger players.

At the moment we have Dawson, Davies, Rose, Walker, Naughton, Lennon, Townsend and Kane, so you'd expect them to be the eight homegrown players we register if all stay. That leaves no space for the likes of Fryers, Mason, Fredericks and Archer, unless they are considered good enough to displace one of our non-homegrown seniors (pretty unlikely) or someone such as Dawson leaves.

The more important issue is how many senior non-homegrown players we have. We can only have 17 of them that are over 21 in the league squad. We currently have the following:

Lloris, Vorm, Friedel  
Vertonghen, Kaboul, Chiriches, BAE  
Sandro, Capoue, Dembele, Paulinho  
Lamela, Eriksen, Holtby, Chadli. Ceballos, Falque  
Soldado, Adebayor

And don't think I've missed anyone, and that's 19; two over a full league quota of non-homegrown senior players.

Fair to assume that at least one if not both of Cebellos and Falque can be removed from there, and BAE is obviously out, but even with all three removed we still have just one non-homegrown spot free - take note everyone who wants us to buy Schneiderlin, a LW, and another CB while offloading the likes of Lennon and Dawson.

I guess maybe Friedel could be replaced by Archer to open up another non-homegrown spot, but that's still tight and I'm sure we'd prefer to wait a season on that. And from next season Dier himself needs to be on that list too, as he turns 21 in January, so that cancels out that gain of a non-homegrown place.

true,IxionS3,null,null,"&gt; boyfriend in UK who has joint tenancy with a friend (contract is against subletting/assigning)

Moving in with him wouldn't technically be subletting or assigning AFAIK. His landlord might not be over the moon about it (or might not care as long as the rent was getting paid) but I don't think there's much he could do about it in the short term.

&gt; if i pay council tax, wouldn't it be apparent i was living somewhere where i wasn't supposed to be?

Apparent to whom?  The council aren't going to dig into the minute details of your living arrangements - if you say you're liable to pay Council Tax at that address, they're going to take your word for it and happily take your money.

&gt; how do I go about setting up a bank account in the UK without an address?

[Lloyds](http://www.lloydsbank.com/banking-with-us/joining-lloyds/new-to-the-uk.asp) say they will give you a current account on the basis of a passport or ID card alone, not proof of address required.  They're likely to want some kind of correspondence address but that could be your boyfriend's place.

&gt; would putting his parents address as my residence be okay to obtain a bank acccount?

If you're living there yes. If you're not living there it's a bit dodgy, although the odds of getting caught are probably fairly slim.  Obviously they'd need to be cool with it, otherwise they're likely to be a bit pissed off when post with your name on it suddenly starts turning up.

&gt; could this be justifiable by saying i am staying with him to look for a job in the area?

What are you worrying about justifying to who? No-one is likely to care that much about your exact living arrangements.

&gt; finding my own place to rent, i won't have a guarantor or payslips, would paying a larger deposit/rent upfront be an option?

It's an option. Not one all landlords will necessarily go for, but if you can put 6 months rent down a lot of landlords will be happy to take it.

&gt; what are the consequences of staying with him til his contract expires? 

None.

&gt; does my presence in the UK for under a year, 'unregistered' pose any problems

No. So long as Council Tax is covered the rest of officialdom really couldn't care less where you're living.  As a British Citizen you have the right to be in the country, and there's no obligation to officially register your address with anyone.

&gt; is there a record of me entering the UK?

You clearly don't have much faith in him, I'm no different whatsoever, but we are fucking stuck with him either way so instead of giving me a rant of all the reasons why he isn't good anymore, which I already know, we could try to at least *talk about* a scenario where the guy we pay £175,000 every week isn't utterly useless.

You said you didn't put forth a lot of effort into the look. For a lot of cosplayers, it's not just about the costume, it's about the hours of effort taken into finding and making the right pieces. Anyone can buy a costume off the rack. And hey, if you want to just toss together a cool costume for fun to walk around in, by all means, do that and have fun! But cosplay is a creative outlet, and if you want people to pay attention to yours and take a bunch of pics and get excited by it, put the work in.

Personally, I get excited by costumes that either A) Are carefully well done to look like the character, or B) Something that maybe isn't perfectly made, but is a really creative/original, or that I don't see often.

Ten is a very popular costume. I always see a million Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. Some of the costumes looked great, but there's so many that it's just not as exciting as seeing the one guy dressed up as Six, or the girl who went as Osgood, or one of the cat nuns.

I agree with you on Kaboul. Even when he's been playing he's looked like a shadow of the player he was. The problem is who to get? Top class CBs are thin on the ground and most of them are already at clubs that can already offer champions league football. I'm actually stumped for a suggestion. 

As for LW i'd love me some Draxler. Doubtful we get him and probably just a pipe dream but i think this is the level of player we should be aiming for if we're talking marquee signings. 

As for the money we haven't been spending the only thing i can think of is that Levy and co are trying to pay off as much of the new stadium as possible in advance so it doesn't hurt us playing catch up later on. It'd be good to know if this was the reason. If it isn't then we should be asking questions of the board.

So how I see it, the only way we could include Bony, Gomis, Montero, Gylfi, and Shelvey is with a lopsided 4-3-3 with a midfield diamond.  Bony would play the false 9 that he played with Vitesse, while Gomis would play as an inside forward on the right side.  Montero would play left winger, with Gylfi and Shelvey in the center midfield.  Gylfi would play more of an attacking role than Shelvey so that Jonjo can slide into a more defensive position to the right of Ki if the lack of a right winger becomes an issue.  Then I'd have Ki playing defensive mid to cover, because I think Jonjo attacks better than he defends.  The wide backs are obvious, as is Williams.  I picked Amat because of Chico's mistakes.

If you do buy a new pet from a breeder or pet shop they should be be able to show you that baby animal's mother and they should be able to produce proof of vet visits, where she sleeps and eats, the general things you'd expect if someone keeps a pet properly. 

Be wary also of anyone who claims they 'took in a pregnant stray' and are selling the resultant babies. Do some checking to see if they've sold animals before and under what conditions.

Who gives a shit? 

Strikers who can provide assists and set up other players through creative are substantially better than one-dimensional strikers who only put the ball in the back of the net. That being said, Torres hasn't figured out the latter part of that during his time at Chelsea. We have exceptional wingers and midfielders who create opportunities and space, Torres is at the least a tertiary option to the team's other creative forces.

Doubt it.

This is a guy who has played as a striker his whole career. I mean just watch his highlights when he was at Liverpool, he was an incredible debutante for them with all of it coming from the 9 slot. We've just come off four seasons of trying to make the Torres project work as a striker. It's not like we have a dearth of talent in the middle or out wide. So who gets put out so that Torres gets a shot at trying to set up the striker? Which player gets alienated from his natural position so Torres can have a go and try to make it work somewhere else.?
