true,Ixius,null,null,"&gt;But it is her choice to have the abortion, there are no medical reasons forcing her hand.

We can set aside the medical risk associated with even a ""straightforward"" pregnancy, and assume that there is no urgent medical demand for the sake of conversation, but it's naive to think that pregnancy is a breeze.

&gt;Do taxpayers want to pay for abortions simply because of contraceptive malfunctions and accidents? Probably not.

Unfortunately, taxpayers have no authority in what the NHS actually uses their money for. Medical decisions are made between patient and physician, independent of how they're being paid for.

&gt;Just accept that if you have sex, no matter how careful you are, you may get pregnant, and have to deal with the consequences.

You certainly must deal with a situation you find yourself in. That's just self-evidently true.

However, it's not true that consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, or even that consent to pregnancy is consent to remaining pregnant. Pregnancy happens to us, not by us: we can't just turn on or off the uterus at will. 

A nice analogy is this: people know that accidents happen when driving a car - is getting in a car consent to a road traffic accident? If you do get into a car accident, must you simply lie in the wreck and just ""let nature run its course"", because you knew you could have gotten into this situation by getting in the car?

&gt;If more people accepted responsibility for their actions, the world would be one step closer to Utopia.

Having an abortion is a means of taking responsibility for a pregnancy. We'll not get into a conversation about utopias, because if your idea of a utopia is a society where a woman is a slave to her biological function, then we won't agree on an awful lot else.",0,1399656582,null,0,false,0,chds86b,t3_25176c,t1_chds86b,t1_chcrzi4,null,1433724048,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

&gt;An __Individual Savings Account__ (__ISA__; /ˈaɪsə/) is a class of retail investment arrangements available to residents of the United Kingdom. It qualifies for a favourable tax status. Payments into the account are made from after tax income. The account is exempt from income tax and [capital gains tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax) on the investment returns, and no tax is payable on money withdrawn from the scheme either. Cash and a broad range of investments can be held within the arrangement, and there is no restriction on when or how much money can be withdrawn. Funds cannot be used as security for a loan.

My priority at the moment is to increase my income, because although I'm massively frugal to the point of cutting things out that I enjoy, my savings are not increasing at the same rate as a flat in outer london.

The only obvious thing is that you guys have a take home pay of 30,000, and you spend 2.5% of that on financing your overdraft. You've really got to get rid of that - that 700 quid a year you're paying for it is just completely wasted. 

The good news is that the costs you've put up there are only half of your income, so you've got quite a bit to play with. I would be tempted to go really cut down for three months and clear the overdraft completely - and forever. 

I notice that you haven't got anything down for food, clothes, haircuts, holidays, drinking, socialising, smoking, gym, mobile phone etc.

After that I'd want a 3-6 month emergency fund - so for your outgoings it would be £3-8 grand depending how you want to measure it. Stick it in a high interest current account like the lloyds one that pays 5% on up to £4k, or the santander one that pays 3%, although there's a fee for that one. Or in a cash ISA if that means you'd be less likely to touch it - cash ISAs are instant access if you do have an emergency. 

After that, I guess it depends what you want in life. If you want a house and kids, you're going to have to save HARD - a grand a month would be awesome. If you just maybe want to retire one day and maybe go on some nice holidays I'd want to save less, maybe 250 each in a pension and 100 in a pot for holidays, cars, nice shit.

Obviously it totally depends on what you want to do in life. 

The rules of personal finance are simple:
Don't spend what you haven't got unless it's a genuine investment - eg house, education, cheap car which means you can get to work.
Interest is for earning, not paying.
For most of us saving and creating our nest egg is bloody long, hard and boring work. But it beats sticking the credit card bills under the sofa because we're so scared to open them.

One good tip is, once your overdraft is gone, to have a standing order set up on your account to take out whatever you've decided to save and stick in another account.",0,1399657198,null,0,false,0,chdsiti,t3_2553rf,t1_chdsiti,t3_2553rf,null,1433724186,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

The first thing is to know how exactly how much you're spending each month, so you can be sure it's below your income. This doesn't have to be a full budget to start with, just get into the habit of both of you adding up how much you have in the bank and how much much you have in your wallets say every sunday morning for now as well as every 1st of the month. Look at your statement online for that week/month and note down any income (mainly your £1153 and their £1258). Cash is usually the devil for numbers adding up, in particular make sure you write down anytime your friends pay you back a tenner or whatever, otherwise you'll start to underestimate your budget.

Once you know how much you're spending, you can make proper plans. e.g. If you're approximately spending as much as you're earning then if you didn't have the overdrafts, you'd be fine (relatively speaking), so just concentrate on not spending *any* non-essential money for a month or three, then you can go back to your current lifestyle.

No, that's not accurate. Nigel Farage is not merely an asshole, he's the epitome of assholitude. If assholes all worshipped a god of ass, it'd look like him. It's sit on a giant plinth shaped like someone filled some poor bastard's digestive system with cement and forced him to crap it out in one unbroken chunk, with a giant sceptre with cracks and wrinkles that are not un-turd-like in nature, and at the top would be a grinning mouth, he'd wear a crown made entirely out of used douches held together by being pricked through with rose thorns, and wear a robe woven from only the finest daily mail headlines. 

The thing is...if he was just a guy, that'd be one thing. One day he might someday have claimed the kind of assholish fame attributed to the likes of Jeremy Clarkson or even Chris Brown, but no, he couldn't be that, could he? No, this guy had to be a politician.

This guy has the pretence, the arrogance, the sheer...assholiness (hey that one could be used in regular conversation to refer to holy leaders we don't like) to claim to represent the UK, the British, the English...meaning he claims, in whole or in part, to represent me.

Fuck all kinds of that.

Furthermore, he seems to think he can spout the same policy verbatim ad nauseum and it'll solve every single problem ever. Nope.exe.

Lastly, and this is the part that puts the suspiciously soft, squishy and smelly brown icing on the cake, he thinks that the people support him entirely and will continue to support a five year government with this one policy.

Nigel Farage doesn't represent me, he doesn't represent my friends, neighbors, co-workers, he doesn't represent the guy that works at the chippy round the corner or the guy I go to when I want to top up my oyster card. Nigel Farage doesn't represent my boss or my landlord, definitely doesn't represent my family both close and distant. Nigel Farage represents Nigel Farage. The problem appears to be that he is unable to tell the difference.

For your second non-point, you disagree. Well I've clearly been outsmarted by you, haven't I? Have a medal. I'll write to Buckhimgham Palace and see if I can't convince the Queen to hold a ceremony for you wherein live on television she can pin it on you somewhere soft and painful.

Chances are whoever we get will be better than AVB/Sherwood (DO NOT JUDGE THEM ON NAME ALONE THOUGH), but there's a small chance they could be worse, it's a gamble whoever you take on, whether they'll work, so a big name isn't a guarantee of success.

I would personally love it if we told companies that they can't call it a legitimate business expense if they buy things from their own parent companies (or companies in mutual ownership), but I really can't see any of politician treating this seriously, at least not for the present decade.

Likewise do you propose that we end trade with Monaco, Antigua, the Channel Islands and the Caymans? Place a blockade on them and prohibit their exports?

It's a principle of international sovereignty that those countries are allowed to regulate their businesses as they wish, and one of free trade that we're not allowed to tax imports of intellectual property from Bermuda any different than imports of intellectual property from Germany or the USA.

I don't see how we can end the current regime of international tax dodging without  all our international trade partners (i.e. the G-20) agreeing to boycott tax havens and prosecute those who funnel money there. Again, globalism is decades away from this, because it would be an attack on the global elite, not to mention the personal fortunes of many of our politicians and former politicians.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I think they want to bring back the principle of selective education so that poor kids get a chance to get a decent education as opposed to the current system now where all the rich kids go off to private schools while the working class get sent to shit-tier comps.

Do you? That's a huge assumption when they've never said anything of the sort. Even then, I was raised in one of the few places in the country to maintain a grammar school system - Warwickshire. Do you know the major determinant on who attended grammar schools? Money. I count myself as fortunate enough to have been offered the opportunity to attend private, grammar or comprehensive education and having chosen to go to a comp, still come out with top grades. See, whilst it seems like it may well be fairer, it is far worse. Grammar schools, by their nature, need donations to maintain standards. That means they need to be built in places where their catchment area is high wealth. Hence, instead of directly paying for education you need to pay for more expensive housing. It's a broken system which is why, despite having been in effect country over, it's now almost entirely abandoned. Trying to return it is folly at best.

&gt;Wind farms are an extremely expensive and inefficient form of energy, I'd prefer to see more money put into solar power if I'm honest.

Solar power is almost as bad, especially in Northern areas with less daylight. Neither method is enough.

&gt;Fracking, whether you believe the estimates, WOULD result in a reduction in the energy bills of working people and we would certainly have enough energy to run the country for some time.

&gt;Contrast that with the left's position which seems to be ""fracking is evil and anyone within a 10 mile radius will die of lead poisoning"", and ask yourself who is really being unrealistic.

Few people argue that fracking is economically unviable. The issue is whether it is a good idea when it's been linked to triggering earthquakes and other seismic activity. I'm glad you've just told yourself that's ""the left"" being unrealistic, even when it's been shown that fracking is unnecessary if we build nuclear power.

&gt;We are the EU's biggest export market. I find it highly unlikely that they wouldn't want a free trade agreement with us. They would be the ones paying the majority of import tariffs. Switzerland has a free trade agreement with the EU. Do you really think they would deny one to us, their biggest export market?

&gt;Get real.

Let's ""get real"" then. You find it ""unlikely""? Let's just point out how absurd your comparison is to start. In order to maintain their free trade with the EU, the Swiss signed away any right to control their own airspace, immigration and internal legal disputes involving EU citizens. They also have been completely stopped from entering into any more than their original 210 trade agreements until they become a member of the EU. Sound good? Cool, because they've just voted to give themselves back immigration controls against members of the EU, to which the response from the EU is likely to be cutting several trade agreements. This is after their immigration hit 1% of the total population PER YEAR. For comparison, the UK just had a large surge and is sitting at about 0.3%. Do I think it likely they would deny us? Extremely if we deny free movement of persons, because they've done it before and may even sever connections because of that exact clause. If you honestly believe otherwise, you're buying bullshit, plain and simple.

&gt;The truth of the matter is that due to wage compression, immigrants often do the jobs because a British person cannot AFFORD to do the same jobs. A group of Polish guys who come over and share a house between 6 of them, can afford to live on a much lower rate than a native Brit who has a child and a mortgage.

Welcome to capitalism. For a start, this idea is idiotic - if people are willing to work in shitty situations, then yeah, they're more desirable employees because people pay them less. I honestly don't know what to say - even barring the thinly veiled racism, just stopping immigration won't prevent these situations. We are in he midst of a population surge with more and more educated workers entering every day. EU immigration doesn't even make up half our immigration, with net birth-deaths higher than net migration by almost double. Say we literally ban all EU citizens entering the UK at all - we would still get about 600000 immigrants a year at the current rate. There must be better immigration controls for sure, but EU immigration is wildly overblown.

&gt;We also have to take into account the fact that in London, the NHS is going through an era of desperation

So let's talk NHS. Specifically, let's talk about what UKIP intends to do with it. You'll notice that they skip over it in every leaflet. Now, I am very privileged to be in a situation where I can find out non-public budgets, though I won't say how. I'll just say this - the UKIP missing money gap, even just from their public figures has risen from their £10.4 billion shortfall in 2010. In fact, it's estimated that they've now got a £100 billion gap. They've also talked of total NHS privatisation very publicly. Hopefully you won't be shocked to hear that they say we need sweeping public sector cuts and that their shortfall is just less than the entire NHS budget. Funny, I wonder why people advocating for total privatisation of the NHS would omit them from their manifesto and simultaneously have that large of a gap...

&gt;And then we have senior figures in education saying that we need to somehow magically create 250,000 new primary school places. This is a direct result of mass immigration.

This is objectively false. Immigration is a contributing factor, not a sole cause. In fact, the entire rhetoric surrounding this is extremely biased and based off of subjective bullshit. There's no evidence for what you've said whatsoever.

&gt;That's because you don't know anyone working class.

Obviously neither player are the long term solution for the pivot but I think Ramires is in a better position to contribute in the next 12 months.  

I agree Matic is a long term piece.  The sale of Luiz would (partially) fund the other piece.  MVG would compete for playing time and Ramires would be the rotational veteran when one or two of the others are out of form/injured.

I don't go that way very often, but the only thing I can whole heartedly recommend is try to get as far out as you can, or find a nice and quiet neighbourhood to live in. After a few years you'll go absolutely crazy from both working and living in a dirty, noisy environment. I sure am.

Looking at your available tube lines: something very convenient might be having a look at areas further out along the piccadilly line, there are some nice places there.

Another one would be Richmond, which is very nice mostly, but it tends to be very expensive along the district line.

true,darksurfer,null,null,"it does make sense. pricing is a somewhat complex subject but businesses basically charge the most they think the market will bear. it helps (a lot) if the price is higher than all the costs involved in selling the product (including VAT) but that isn't how the price is calculated (though obviously costs are a consideration). 

the amount of VAT a company pays is 20% of all its sales (VAT output) minus the VAT already paid on all it's purchases (VAT input). The difference between a companies sales and it's purchases being it's ""Value added"" ...

So lets take a stab at guestimating a ballpark figure of how much VAT (tax!) Amazon pays each year. Amazon sells £4.3bn per year and lets assume a 100%  mark up on it's products.

(20%x£4.3bn) - (20%x£2.15bn) = £430million

So, just in VAT Amazon *""wrote a cheque""* for £430 million to HMRC. Hardly what I would call paying no tax.

If I could be bothered I might take a stab at guestimating how much their other taxes were, but I think I made my point?

edit: for the avoidance of doubt, it is a little more complicated than this, in that VAT causes a ""distortion"" in the market price. The effect of which is that consumers pay a bit more for products than the natural market price and companies receive less than the natural market price. In effective VAT is shared between consumers and businesses to some varying proportion depending on the nature of the market. the same effect is true of national insurance and income tax.",0,1399663468,null,0,1399664360,0,chdvjux,t3_254lqx,t1_chdvjux,t1_chdv67n,null,1433725611,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

So the Lords approved the Bill, but there was a Government-defying vote - in which some of the Lords will have voted against the Party - on a specific amendment.

The Bill then returns to the Commons where the Commons has to approve the amendments made to the Bill by the Lords. Generally this is a formality (as the Government usually gets its way so there will be nothing in the Bill it isn't happy with) but in this case they've whipped their MPs to reject the Lords' amendment. This means the whole Bill now bounces back between the Houses, with the Lords and Commons taking it in turn to accept or reject the other's amendments until they agree.

If they don't agree by Wednesday 21 (iirc), the Bill gets stalled as that is the end of the Parliament.

Either the Lords or Commons (i.e. the Government) blinks, or the Bill dies. And the Government apparently isn't going to blink.

I know what you're thinking. Gee, aren't Gerrard's and Kolo's mistakes more costly as they directly lost us points? I don't think so. Hendo made a stupid studs-up challenge at the end of one of the biggest games of the year (when the result wasn't guaranteed yet.) By doing so he jeopardized that match, and the three matches he got suspended for.

I don't think Hendo would have won us the Chelsea match. A slip is a slip, and that's someone else's mistake. (Although, his presence couldn't have possibly been less effective than Lucas'.) But, Hendo's needless suspension is why Lucas has had to play so out of position, and I'd argue why we drew at Palace.

Sure, anyone can get suspended at any time. And we've lost matches with important players out for injuries, but none have been for such needless reasons. When you rely so heavily on such a small squad, it's fatal when you have to suddenly change up the line-up so much.

true,HereComeTheBastards,celtic,,"I formatted it a little:

As with every season, Celtic have had their ups and downs. The ups being qualifying for the champion’s league, and the clean sheet record, but apart from that, it's been nothing special. 

**Transfers**

Their season started off on the wrong foot by selling their 3 best players, which have left huge holes in the team. Even though replacements have come in, not many have shown their maximum potential. 

In my opinion, the signing of van Dijk has been the best the club has made in years. His ability defending and taking the ball forward is second to none, and I really hope Celtic do everything possible this summer to hold on to him. 

Nir Biton is another who has done well, and settled in quickly. But an injury filled campaign has kept him out for a lot of matches. 

Stefan Johansen has been other good find from the scouting team. He settled in very quickly, and filled the gap left by Joe Ledley going to Crystal Palace. He has great ability in finding his man, and isn't afraid to get rough when needed. 

The one thing I would like Celtic to take away from this season is to not let their best players leave this summer. 

**SPL**

In terms of football, the season has been so-so. The Premiership was always in the bag, but poor performances before the Christmas meant having some terrible football to watch. The string of 1-0 victories were extremely boring, and a huge waste of time. After the break, the games got more entertaining. The players upped their game, and the attacking and defending of each match was entertaining to watch. As the clean sheet record went on, the games became nail biters anytime the opposition got a chance on goal. With the two cups though, it was quite the contrary. A terrible, boring performance to Morton meant we were out the league cup. And when Aberdeen went to Celtic park for the Scottish cup, Celtic clearly weren’t up for it. Aberdeen on the other hand had a stormer, and progressed to the next round. 

**Europe**

The champion’s league didn’t give us much to talk about either. Three points from six games meant Celtic left the competition bottom of their group, with only 3 goals on the table too. However, I still maintain that the second leg of the Shaktar Karagandy match was some of the best football I’ve watched all season, which obviously sent Celtic into the champion’s league with style. The first match against Milan was up for grabs, until Scott Brown gave away a silly free kick which led to Celtics defeat. The home game wasn’t much better. Celtic were played off the park and were hammered at home, something that is a rare sight for them… Well, at least in Europe anyway! The first game against Barcelona was all going to plan, until Scott Brown stupidly, and viciously kicked out against Neymar, resulting in him being sent off and given a ban. The match in Spain is one I’m sure all fans would like to forget, so I won’t talk about it too much, but watching it at the time I thought it was going to end in Celtic’s record defeat ever, not just in Europe. The games against Ajax were two I thought Celtic must win. The home match was entertaining, and was relieving to get some points on the board. When Celtic then went to Amsterdam, they never showed up, which meant Ajax tore them apart and secured their place in the Europa league knockout stages. 

**Overall**

As a whole, the season didn’t give Celtic supporters much to shout about. Poor performances in Europe and in domestic competitions meant it was the kind of season to be forgotten quickly, except from the clean sheet record that was broken. I think, for next season Celtic must do better in Europe. Every team in Scotland relies on them getting European football, so that the league remains somewhat recognised, and the number of European places from the league doesn’t change for the worst again. 

Along with Celtic doing better, I would like to see another team or two getting into Europe. It is truly crunch time at the moment for Scottish football, and the next few years will be make or break for the countries reputation.

&gt;The army's new policy of making all recruits undergo the same physical training has resulted in many more injuries among female soldiers, research suggests.
A study claims that female recruits are more than twice as likely to suffer injury than when they were not expected to complete such a vigorous training programme as men.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11967351

&gt;We found that for all disease and injury categories of medical discharge there is a statistically significant excess in females; this disparity is particularly marked for discharges on account of injury [relative risk (RR) = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.30-2.10] and musculoskeletal disease (RR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.75-4.06). Royal Navy females are eight times more likely (RR = 7.92, 95% CI = 3.03-20.66) and Army females seven times more likely (RR = 6.53, 95% CI = 2.60-16.42) than Royal Air Force females to be medically discharged on account of injury. Over the period 1993-1996, there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of medical discharge for both musculoskeletal disease and injury in female personnel in the British armed forces. During the period 1996-2000, a marked gender differential was maintained, but the rate of increase in females reached a plateau.

&gt;***We concur with previous investigators that mixed-sex training imposes particular ergonomic stresses on females and that it is a major risk factor for overuse injury.***

But on the other hand the Canadian army is successful at full integration with women in combat roles. *shrugs* You takes yer money and tries your chances. I'm not 100% sure where I fall on this tbh.

3) if mignolet can sort out a few of his playing irks then he'll be golden, otherwise i think we really can do better

4) Ibe, Wisdom and Suso are going to be vital as rotation/bench players - i know we all want them to burst into the first but it'll be easier for us to play them on the bench than it will be to buy new players and have them sit there and the lads are capable enough

some of japan is pretty affordable, okinawa for example is about half the price of the UK for rent. obviously i do not mean central tokyo! some places you rent an apartment for as low as 200/month, but obviously not a great apartment, so maybe 400/month rent for it to be reasonable

I only recently finished uni last year with lots of debt 35k? ish which I doubt I can ever afford to pay back, I have about 10G saved, earning maybe 20G, live at home (it sucks), and can save maybe 15G/year, but i have been spending a bit of cash recently to buy stock for another business I am currently starting, which I will proceed to plug -&gt; http://watchgearonline.co.uk 

I was thinking, save a deposit, buy an apartment asap for about 150k, rent it and continue to live at home, pay off the mortgage as fast as possible, then move to a cheaper country.

In this cheaper country, hopefully Japan (first world, safeish, nice tropical islands), I still plan to work in some way or another, and probably will start some kind of business there even if it is just english teaching.

I could just up-sticks and go to japan tomorrow and look for work, but I feel it is risky, as in I might go and not be able to secure work/visa, spend all my money and end up back at square one, in england in a couple of years time. So, my plan is to enable myself to make a move abroad in a *sustainable* manner, so that I am not financially pressured, and can get by (perhaps forever?) from renting the place in England out indefinitely.

This is my plan, sometimes I feel quite confident, and other times I think it feels to good to be true/possible. So, what do you think? Is it maybe feasible? Is anyone else doing/has done anything like this?

I'm expecting an answer measured in years :P

I joke, sort of, but reading your post it struck me that you could do a trek around the whole coastline.  Clockwise from London for example, Whitstable, the white cliffs/Beachy Head, Brighton, Portsmouth, New Forest, Jurassic Coast, Devon/Cornwall/SWCP, Bristol, Cardiff, Gower peninsula... a proper mix of small towns (traditional seasort resorts and 'normal' towns), larger cities, cliffs and beaches and we're, what, 15% of the way around?  But you'd need so much time and still be missing everything inland as well!

Obviously with visas etc this doesn't seem realistic, so a degree of harsh prioritisation of must-sees will have to happen... or else, you could try a different tack and choose a somewhat arbitrary 'straight line' route between places, thus forcing yourself to see everything along the way, be it touristy or starkly otherwise.  

Or as you're into camping, maybe look into some of our [long-distance footpaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-distance_footpaths_in_the_United_Kingdom).  As others have explained, true wild camping is pretty limited in England, much more possible in Scotland, but classic routes like the Pennine Way, Offa's Dyke or South West Coast Path will have numerous camping opportunities along them as they're well trafficked by camping hikers, and sort of by definition they go through some of our nicest countryside.

You will have to pay to transfer money from bank accounts to different countries. With a bank transfer there will be a fee for the transfer to a foreign country, it's also possible whatever bank account you may have in Japan will charge to receive the money. 

You could try it through paypal (which will charge to a foreign account as well) or Western Union (which apparently doesn't tell you the exchange rate until after you get your money). Either way, you will be spending money to get your money. You have probably seen this site [but if not it's worth a look for more information.](http://www.survivingnjapan.com/2012/06/how-to-transfer-money-to-and-from-japan.html)

Is your debt student debt? And if you doubt whether you can pay that back I am confused as to how you will be able to afford a flat?

How many flats that would be available for that price will come fully furnished in your area? If you are the landlord how would you take care of the business in the flat while you're living in a different continent?

Would moving to a completely different culture not bother you at all? 
Do you have experience or any afiliation with Japan? Have you experienced earthquakes before (serious question, they're pretty strange and a lot of people panic)? 

While this is a good idea it sounds like you need to maybe look a bit more into this, as you don't seem to have an actual plan at this stage. 

Edit: Genuinely for a visa you need to have proof of work, so if you go over there without any work and fail to find any in the alotted timescale (3 months for most countries) you will find yourself back in England very quickly.

""A Lesson for Lent and Easter by way of a Response to a Review

The reviewer appears to be envious of the good review given to the restaurant by Lisa from Wales and appeared to feel the desire to tarnish it with his own less favourable one. It is not very charitable of the reviewer to harbour such envy so close to Easter. I sense a need to turn the other cheek but have run out to cheeks to turn. Although to err is human to forgive divine but as I am not divine it is not in my gift to forgive and therefore I have only one option left that is to respond and just as I have benefited from what the reviewer had said I trust the reviewer will similarly glean some benefit from what I am about to say now. 

The reviewer referred to previous visits to the restaurant which appeared to say that some dishes were very good while others were not liked by the reviewer. As the reviewer did not specify which period of time these visits cover I am quite unable to respond to comments made in the absence of further details given that the restaurant has been open for some five years now but concur that the reviewer is at liberty to go where the reviewer chooses.

The reasons given for submitting this poor review were that my response to the one headed ""In Good Location When Visiting Waterside Theatre"" was sarcastic and that an apology was due to that reviewer. I beg to differ that my response was in anyway sarcastic, merely factual and I am quite unable to apologise for comments made by that reviewer on someone else's food been lukewarm as that would be apologising for hearsay. 

When I said that to the average everything is average and to the mediocre everything is mediocre, I am merely being truthful. An average person is like a frog in well which will have a limited horizon as opposed to another who is not similarly constrained. This is not to belittle mediocrity. Current standards are so low that if one is consistently mediocre one can be rated as being a genius which accounts for why an artist like Damien Hirst is rated as a latter day Leonardo da Vinci. I accept that consistency is important as a sane person is virtually indistinguishable from one who is consistently mad.

The restaurant provides wholesome, healthy, fresh food with affordable prices in a sea of junk and fast food eateries and I cannot concede that anyone but an ignoramus can rate this restaurant as being in any way average. 

Given that we are so near to Easter I can be forgiven, I hope, for referencing Christ who set his bar extremely high. He required his followers to lust for righteousness. In comparison my bar is quite low, I merely want my customers to lust for WHOLESOME, HEALTHY, FRESH food. But even this has proved to be a mountain to climb, given the preponderance of cheap junk food outlets available all around. The reviewer should take heed from what Christ said to Peter when he rebuked Magdalene for wasting money on oil to anoint him with instead of giving it to the poor. His reply was ""The poor you will have with you always, I you have not"". Therefore the reviewer should take advantage of whatever we have on offer while stock last as it were. By the way, it is not generally known that there is gospel of life of Christ by Magdalene, which early chauvinistic Bishops suppressed. I do not think for one moment that Christ was decrying the poor in his response, just as sweet are the uses of the adversity, poverty also has its uses too. The poor are music to the ears of the pious as the poor are stepping stones for the pious to sainthood as evidenced by Mother Theresa.

I provide wholesome, healthy, food at affordable prices not because I am generous. Only the poor can truly be generous as the poor have nothing to give which was why Christ put such stall on the parable of the Widow's Mite. What about philanthropic rich I hear? The rich give not out of generosity but of pragmatism as the rich realise that if not given it will all be taken away by the grim reaper in any event. You can be forgiven, when you look at the current rich list that the ALMIGHTY favours geeks. There must be mistake in translation from ancient Aramaic and the scripture should read ""And the geek shall inherited Earth"" instead of the meek as it stands. You can also be forgiven for thinking that you have to be clever to be rich, not so, look at Bill Gates, one of the richest man in the World. Bill Gates is rich not because Bill Gates is clever, but because IBM was stupid and he capitalised on its stupidity. And therefore you must hope and pray this Easter that you to will be lucky enough to encounter stupidity and are able to capitalise on it to become rich likewise. 

By the way there is good description of the dangers of obesity and a sedentary life style in Dante's Divine Comedy where he depicted SATAN seated munching sinners, including Popes, being obese and impotent. Maybe HE could be put off from his unhealthy diet of red meat by being told the ""parable"" of the cannibals's dinner party, where when one diner complained to another that he hated his wife was advised to stick to the vegetables. 

For the less initiated, Dante was the lusty Italian poet who lived circa 1300 and was banished from Florence and his beloved Beatrice for backing the wrong side. His work, in all probability was a sublimation of his sexual desires as in real life his beloved Beatrice was married off to a banker. His idea of heaven was to be with her there. I hope for his sake that his beloved Beatrice was as keen on him as he was keen on her, otherwise he ought to get a teaser to pinch a flame from Hades to thaw her out before the encounter in case she turned to ice upon his touch leaving his fingers with frostbite; that will not do. 

I also provide good, healthy food to the public at affordable prices not because I am virtuous. Virtue is its own reward, that is why the virtuous are poor. As virtue gives such poor reward, it is not an attribute that I can afford to have. Nor do I wish for adoration as Christ learnt to his cost crucifixion follows adoration as night follows day. Although I am prepared for the slings and arrows of outrageous reviews, I am unwilling to be crucified for my cause as Christ was.

Have any of you ever considered how the course of religious history would have changed if the High Priest had not been so dumb as to ask for Christ to be crucified? If not crucified, Christ could not have been resurrected and Christianity would have lost its Unique Selling Point (USP) and the small sect of Christ and his 12 disciples plus one would have vanished from the history without trace. I am sorry to say such dumb leaders still exist in Judea today. 

It is evident that my mission is not as laudable as Christ's. My mission is merely to prevent the public from trashing their lives by eating trash and burdening themselves with ill health and obesity to the detriment of themselves and Society. Therefore my mission is very modest indeed. So what do you expect from such an ""average"" restaurateur? 

In conclusion, in keeping with modernity, I would like to leave this thought as a tweet for all to meditate on this Easter:- 

""When good is crucified there is always hope of salvation for believers, but when evil or bad is crucified there is no way back"". 

Therefore this Easter above all be good and if at all possible be consistently good which may even be sufficient to qualify for sainthood if that is your cup of tea. 

I hasten to add that whether it is my cup of the or not, I do not qualify, as I am not a believer. 

By the way, you could do no better than join us at the restaurant to celebrate Easter; think of the good it will do to your health. 

A Happy Easter to you All.""

**The Skipper's Notes - It's been an absolute joy to play this way in front of our phenomenal fans**

At this club we all know that there is no such thing as a lost cause. Olympiacos, Istanbul, the FA Cup final against West Ham United in 2006 - on many occasions in the past the odds have been heavily against us and we've fought back to go on and enjoy success. That's why, while we still have a chance of being champions, we'll give our all until the final whistle blows today.

Manchester City obviously have the title in their own hands. But we have to ensure that if they drop points against West Ham we take full advantage and that's our intention.

Whatever happens this afternoon we are back in the Champions League next season. Last summer that was our main aim. Some people outside of the club doubted we could do it. We were quietly confident about securing a place in the top four.

To have done so and scored almost 100 league goals along the way is an achievement we should all be proud of. The Premier League is an incredibly difficult competition, as Monday night's game against Crystal Palace proved yet again. The majority of the teams are capable of causing each other problems, home or away. That's why if you finish in the top four you've definitely earned it.

I don't think anyone can deny we've made huge strides as a team under Brendan Rogers. He demands that we consistently attack with pace and style and it's been a joy to play in such a way.

That approach has helped to make Anfield one of the most difficult venues to visit once again. No side relishes coming here and our home form has been one of the main reasons why we've done well.

Today we want to add to that good record against Newcastle United. The best way to do so is by starting quickly and attempting to score an early goal, as we have done so often this season. I'm sure word about what's happening at the Etihad will reach everyone here. We need to ignore any of that and just concentrate on our own task.
Finally I'd like to conclude by thanking you: the fans. This season your immense support has been a major reason for our positive results. Now we need you to give us one more push.

Wherever we finish in the table, I'm confident that with your continued backing and some quality additions this summer we can continue to fight for top honours in the future.

i figured that a letting agency could handle the property, or even a family member could oversee it for me. i am sure i can figure something out?

I suppose the international part is not important. it is more the ""buy and rent one flat in a relatively expensive area, and then live somewhere cheaper"" side that i am driving at. imagine i am saying that i want to buy a flat in the south east, and then move to scotland and live off the rent, or something like that....

However, if you are going to say ""tax"" and look at the gross sales figure, it is just down right shady to not include the VAT in that figure.  I love VAT as a taxation concept, only effecting people buying luxury things (debate about tampons not withstanding).

So I use this software to download over 30 videos from this fitness site. A day later I tried logging in the website and the website said I have been banned. I log in to my email to find out what the problem is and turns out the person handling the site found out and sent me a letter from his lawyer saying how I need to delete all the videos or they will take me to court.

The simple premise of buying the flat in an expensive area and living in a cheap one is a good idea. The problem is you don't seem to have an actual solid plan, and have overlooked 'small details' to you, but in fact these are integral to your plan. 

Specifically: Where will you live, how will you buy a place while owing money, what job will you do (in order to gain a visa), how will you move over there with your belongings, how will you cope with the international bank transfers (as you will need to wait for specific times to make sure you're not losing too much money).

As far as the risks go, let me paste directly from the [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/buy-to-let-property-investments):

* The amount of rent you can charge varies according to a number of factors, including wider market trends outside your control. Rents are not guaranteed.
* If you can’t find tenants – or if you can’t charge the rent you expected – you may not be able to cover your mortgage repayments.
* If house prices fall, the value of your property is likely to fall as well. You may not be able to sell it for as much as you hoped.
* If you have to sell and the sale price doesn’t cover the whole mortgage, you’ll have to make up the difference.
* Major repairs or difficult tenants may increase your costs – and trouble – unexpectedly.
* (however) If the housing market does well, you may be able to sell your property for a profit.

Simples: Because you're going to need a currency you can trade, and it isn't going to be the euro. That means its going to be pounds sterling, and that's going to go one of two ways - currency union (in which things like base tax rates are going to effectively be decided in Westminster... like they currently are) OR simply unofficially using the currency - in which the rUK won't allow you to undercut them on tax rates.

&gt;irony

&gt;ˈʌɪrəni


&gt;noun

&gt;the expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect.
""‘Don't go overboard with the gratitude,’ he rejoined with heavy irony""


&gt;synonyms:	sarcasm, sardonicism, dryness, causticity, sharpness, acerbity, acid, bitterness, trenchancy, mordancy, cynicism; More


&gt;antonyms:	sincerity


&gt;a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often wryly amusing as a result.

Or, to put it another way, your definition of irony is synonymous with having ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife. Or possibly like rain on your wedding day.",0,1399674446,null,0,false,0,che0gq4,t3_255axe,t1_che0gq4,t1_chdxkvq,null,1433727991,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Looking back at our results though is pretty disappointing. We didn't get out played, we just fell apart. Once teams figured us out, we had no plan B. That is disappointing and worrying, especially when we have the best manager in the world at our helm.

The last month of this season is really leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Too much in-fighting and making excuses.

Transition seasons are supposed to create bonds and chemistry between the players and I just don't feel like that happened at the front. That is the biggest disappointment for me. Our back 5 have done great and I feel like they are a great cohesive element, but I just don't see that in out midfield.

true,InfernoZeus,lfc68,,"&gt; He will expect to play when fit unless there is a strategic reason for being removed (e.g. CL game in 3 days) which means he (and most players of that sort) are going to expect to play 80+% of the time they are available. 

Just because a player expects to start a certain percentage of games doesn't mean he will. That's where the managers ability to keep the players happy is essential, and it's something that Rodgers is excellent at.

&gt;  They only have that sort of depth through massive weekly paychecks which we simply can't afford and even then the players still get pissed and eventually want to leave if they're not playing.

That's their way of doing it, but it's not the only way of doing it. The only reason they have players with massive paychecks is that they buy players who are in the prime of their career, and whose clubs (and sometimes even the players themselves) don't want the move to happen at first.

Investing in players at a younger age and bringing them up through the academy/U21 means you don't have to constantly be spending massive amounts on transfers/wages, but you can still maintain a competitive bench.

true,mollymoo,null,null,"It seems you don't know what you are spending your money on. Working that out is the first task. You can't make good decisions without good information.

You're not really in debt enough to need serious debt management and you don't have enough money to consider investing, so your focus should be on understanding and managing your spending. If you do that you can go from spending a bit more than you earn (which you have been, otherwise you wouldn't be in debt) to spending a bit less so you can stop paying interest to the bank and start saving money for nice things.

You need to, for at least a whole month, record everything you spend. Spreadsheet, pocketbook, phone app - whatever works for you. Just do it. Do it as you go, as trying to work out what you spend that £50 you got out of the cash machine on three weeks ago isn't easy.

This will do two things: First, it will let you know where you are spending your money so you can identify the most painless ways to spend a little less. Second, it will make you think about the money you spend which will probably mean you spend less (this can have the worrying side effect that you'll have no idea what you used to spend it on!).

You need to do this because it's really easy to fritter away lots of money without realising. A latte and a pastry on the way to work might be £4, which isn't a whole lot, but if you both did that every day it would be £2000 a year.

Once you know what you are spending you can work out how much you *need* to be spending (and you do need to spend money on enjoying yourself!). This might be a full-on categorised budget where you track everything you spend, or just setting up your finances to make it easy to know where you are so you can make good decisions. This can be as simple as separating your money - everything direct debit just after pay day, joint account for bills etc., separate savings account(s), then your own current accounts for fun money and personal stuff.",0,1399679083,null,0,false,0,che2cyc,t3_2553rf,t1_che2cyc,t3_2553rf,null,1433728885,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5

A national discourse that includes allowing mosques, halal businesses (even previously non-halal franchises catering to their majority customers - see Subway) community centres, schools, gathering places and even Muslim-only charities to grow uninhibited and mostly ungoverned under the belief that people are decent no matter what religion they believe in?

Yeah, clearly they should feel utterly victimised and oppressed, living in self-enclosed secular communities with every facility they want tailored expressly to their particular religious flavour.

Not that I'm attacking that way of life, though I don't feel it's the best way to integrate into society in another country, but come the fuck on. Not all Muslims are the same and easily 80+% of Muslims in the UK were likely born here and probably couldn't give two shits about the guys getting killed in the war, just like all the other people who couldn't give two shits about all the Christians or Jews getting killed over there too, as long as the milk turns up and the trash goes away on time.

War is fucking ugly and people are ignorant and mostly stupid, to draw this completely unproven causal link between the two is all three.

To blame the government for this guy wanting to go to Pakistan to learn how to make bombs and hurt innocent people - likely including some fellow Muslims - and then actually taking action to prevent it, like he should somehow be given the right to murder and maim in this country because wars are happening elsewhere is the most fucking absurdly stupidly ugly thing of all.

I personally think that not enough people use Stamford Bridge's age/origin as a sense of great pride. Built in 1877, it is the second-oldest football stadium in Europe and the third-oldest sports stadium in Europe at all after Lord's Cricket Ground (1814) and Bramall Lane (1855). I know in this current age of the game with billionaire owners and the ungodly amount of money that the sport generates, the trend is to move to larger modern stadiums that will generate more revenue.

You're in a fairly terrible financial position. You have no savings, you're dependent on borrowing to get by, you **need** to reign in your spending until at least you're out of debt and have an emergency fund set up. Emergency funds are not optional.

Your social spending is obscene for someone in your financial position. Start a budget and stick to it, make sacrifices short term (no more spending so much on going out!) so that you're not forced to sacrifice everything long term. You are currently one step away from a disaster, you should not be considering any further borrowing...

1. Look at the last 3 months of your expenses, work out where every single penny has gone. You need to know exactly how much you're spending, not ""around"" or ""about"", ""exactly £x was spent in March on x"".
2. Make a budget, a budget that includes *everything*. Account for every single pound.
3. Make sacrifices.

I would highly recommend you look into the [You Need A Budget](http://youneedabudget.com) software, it's very good and if you follow their *method* (they have online classes about dealing with personal finance) you'll be back in the black in no time :) You're in the fortunate position that you have no excuse for your current financial situation, yes you're in a bad financial situation *but* you have an easy way out.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

They cannot guarantee with 100% certainty they can meet supply. How are they going to supply all their customers on an evening during peak demand especially when there's little wind? It certainly isn't with their ""Green Gas Mills"" because they've not even found sites for them yet let alone started constructing them, likewise their ""Sea Mills"" which don't even exist on a drawing board, they're just ""researching technology"". All they've got are the wind turbines and they've only got 55 of those currently operational and when you look at the pictures of them, they're hardly what I'd call the high output category.

&gt; They no longer offer tariffs that are subsidised by nuclear/coal, etc. **as they produce enough energy to supply their customers, and for the same reason do not need to ""buy in"" renewable energy from other companies.**

Really? Their current maximum generating capacity from their operational 55 turbines is just 61,500kW. They have 114,000 domestic customers. That works out at 0.54kW each customer. However as I type this, their current capacity on their realtime reporting page is 18,932kW or 0.166kW per customer. Jesus, my TV alone uses that! It states on the same page my fridge is using 30W. If you multiply that by the number of customers then almost 1/5th of their generating capacity as I type is used up just running fridges. If the wind is the same in the morning they're going to be fucked when people get up, put the kettle on, have a shower...

However they don't just have domestic customers. They have 5,928 business customers as well. So you're looking at sharing 61,500kW **maximum** capacity between 120,000 customers, 0.5kW each. But as the real time generating page shows, they're not always running at maximum capacity or anywhere near.

The numbers do not add up in any way, shape or form for the claim that Ecotricity produce enough energy to supply their customers.

1 - Not to give a bloody penny to anyone who makes the decision to bring in a player until the manager, director of football, and head scout have come to agree upon and fully recognize an outlaid plan including tactics, squad needs, and individual suitability.

2 - I affirm I have learned to take care of at least some transfer business earlier in the summer window so as to cease hemorrhaging points in August that have cost us in previous years. I see now what a difference those points have made. 

3 - To excruciatingly and carefully choose my next manager, as I am willing to give him at least two years.

4 - That my strict sitting rules around the Lane do more harm than good.

Honestly the only team that has recently overpaid on transfers involving British players has been us. And that was three years ago. There's a stigma attached to it now. If Lallana was French, Spanish, German, you'd subconsciously be more agreeable to the £20 million price tag. Weird isn't it. Think of transfers over the last few seasons and £20 million for Lallana is reasonable. Look at the players Spurs brought it. Chelsea spending £30 mil on Willian. United £28 million on Fellaini. £38 million on Mata. Mata is great, but is he worth £18 million more than Lallana? Nobody was crying out that United had overpaid for Mata, but I'd bet my left nut that if he'd have been English they would have. If we don't sign Lallana, one of the other big clubs will. Fuck that. And if we have to spend £5 million more that what he's worth, well that's just how it is. During the window you might get a player for £5 million less that he's worth. But sometimes you just might have to pay £5 million more than he's worth. It's stupid to miss out because you refuse to be flexible. Obviously we don't want to get our pants pulled down.

Living in Stanmer Court I can see why people view it as an 'outcast' residence, but the truth is it's fantastic and totally should be in your top 3 choices. Social life here depends on you really. In freshers' week there were lots of flat parties and that's basically how you'll get to know your flatmates and people from other flats (all of my housemates next year are from my floor in SC). 

You'll probably be going out quite a lot too I imagine, whether it's at night into town or during the day to nip to the shops, and SC is situated between the train station and a bus stop which makes it SO. INCREDIBLY. PRACTICAL. I cannot stress how useful this has been throughout the year, seriously. 

Maybe the only real downsides are the feeling of isolation from other residences (though it's not as remote as you might expect), the distance to walk to campus buildings as well as the campus bars, and (depending where your flat is) the noise from the great big motorway (top floor rooms overlooking the courtyard and on the side closest to the train station are quietest). Also it does get quite warm in the flats, as in our kitchen window has been open and the thermostat on minimum since September...also it gets smelly in the blocks occasionally...and there's a 10 second fire drill every Friday morning.

Realistically though, I think he'll be sold. Hull have done us a favor by playing him so much, as we can now charge the price of an established Prem-level, homegrown central midfielder.

true,shroob88,null,null,"&gt; I'm not sure how unusual this is, but I've never actually been anywhere outside the UK and I'm in my 20s now. I've actually only been outside England a handful of times, and that was only to visit Scotland and Wales when I was a kid. I wanted to ask a few questions about traveling abroad as I'm a bit clueless about it. I know that, at a minimum, you need a passport and obviously money to spend in the currency of the country you are visiting. I wanted to ask about that firstly. Do you normally just do the conversion in the UK and take money with you, or can you not just take your debit or credit card and use that abroad when you need to access money?
 I've no idea about conversions to be honest. I've never needed to know.

Money conversion - Personally I exchange money in the UK first.  Do not do it at the airport.  There are credit cards that allow free use abroad (if you do use your regular card they will charge you a lot for this).  Also inform the bank you are going to a certain country so they don't think it's fraud and freeze the card.

&gt; 
&gt; Also, how do you usually buy the tickets for your plane? Do you buy return tickets at the same time? I don't really know how that works.

There are 2 types of holiday, broadly speaking; package and 'independent'.  Package holidays have the advantage that everything is included - flights, hotels, transfers etc.  But they may not be exactly what you want.  Independent holidays are where you organise flights, accommodation, etc. by yourself.  They can work out cheaper, but not necessarily so, it depends on what type of holiday you want.  

 Also how do visas work? Do you need one even if you are only visiting a country for a few days?

It depends on the country you are visiting.  If you got to an EU country your British passport will suffice.  Some countries allow visas on arrival, some you have to get in advance.  Best thing is to decide on a country then look into what you need.  Just google 'Country X foreign office entry requirements' and you should be taken to the FO's website which will tell you.

 Also, do you need to go for an interview to get a passport? A while back I heard about some kind of citizenship test being implemented where you get asked a bunch of silly questions about the UK when you are getting a passport. Did anyone here have to do that?
&gt; 

I haven't had to get a new passport for many years, so can't remember.  

&gt; I hope this won't be seen as unpatriotic or anything. I'm quite happy in the UK. I've seen most of the important sights and landmarks, etc. There's a lot of the world that I haven't seen though and I'd like to start while I'm still relatively young and healthy.

If you convert in advance you can hunt around to find the cheapest rates (the Post Office are usually good, I think?) but carrying around a giant wad of cash isn't always a good idea. Cards offer more convenience but you'll have to pay a commission on every transaction, and it's often a lot higher. 

- With nearly all forms of travel the earlier you book the cheaper it is. It's normal to book outbound and return tickets together and the dates and times will be fixed unless you pay extra.

Poke around for a bit first, maybe look up a guide or two, and take your time. If you're unsure about this you can go to a travel agent, they'll handle everything from flights to accommodation, although you'll lose out on choice.

- A visa is leave to enter a country. There are different types. Depending on where, a tourist visa is (usually) easy to get, entering a country to live and work is much tougher. You get it as a stamp on your passport. You don't need a visa to travel to any EU countries, for others you'll need to deal with the country's embassy. Check their website for the procedure and requirements. There's often a fee. 

- The citizenship test is for those who want to become British citizens. You already are one. You can get a passport application form from the post office, as far as I recall it costs about £75 and can take several weeks. Be careful with it once you have it, it's a valuable document and if it's lost or stolen it's a real hassle getting a new one. And what are you on about, apologising for wanting to travel? The world is an incredible, amazing place, of course you should get out there and see it.

true,davedontmind,null,null,"I'm not a regular traveller, but I'll give some of your questions a shot...

&gt; I know that, at a minimum, you need a passport and obviously money

My mantra for checking I've got the essentials is ""ticket, money, passport"" - if you've got those 3 you'll be ok, but obviously luggage of some description helps too!

&gt;  Do you normally just do the conversion in the UK and take money with you, or can you not just take your debit or credit card

I may be wrong, but I'm under the impression it may cost more if you use your credit card abroad, due to conversion rates. If I'm going for a week's holiday in the sun I'll just change sterling to euros (or whatever) before I go, either at the airport or somewhere like Sainsburys where they do a reasonable rate.

&gt; Also, how do you usually buy the tickets for your plane? Do you buy return tickets at the same time?

You can buy them online from the airline's website, or through a travel agency if you want the full package (often easier if you want someone else to organise everything). I've always booked both directions at the same time, but I imagine it's like trains and you can get one-way only if you want.

&gt; Also, do you need to go for an interview to get a passport?

I never had to - just fill in the form that you can get from the post office (or probably on-line these days), and send it off with money &amp; photo, then wait.

&gt; There's a lot of the world that I haven't seen though and I'd like to start while I'm still relatively young and healthy.

Go for it! Air travel is just as easy as train travel these days

If you were born in 1983 or after (so yes), you'll need some additional information about your parents, and the birth, adoption, or naturalisation certificate for at least one of them, because you need to prove they're British too. All this is explained on the booklet that comes with the application form, and there's also a helpline if you have extra questions. You'll also need to send your birth or adoption certificate and two photos, one of which needs to be verified by somebody else (again, lots of info in the little booklet), and all documents must be either originals, or official copies, not photocopies.

true,IxionS3,null,null,"**MONEY**  

Spending on a credit card or debit card is generally the best deal abroad - you will get an exchange rate that is significantly better than you can get from exchanging cash.  Watch out for vendors ""helpfully"" offering to charge you in sterling rather than the local currency - they will generally give you a poor rate. You want to be charged in the local currency and have your card company do the conversion.  The caveat to this is that countries vary a lot in how widely credit cards are used and accepted, so it's worth doing a bit of research on specific destinations.

Getting money out of local ATMs with your debit card will generally work and give you a reasonable rate, but make sure you know what if any charges your bank will apply if you do this - there's often a fixed fee for foreign withdrawals which makes it worth taking out a reasonable chunk at a time.  Again research specific destinations for the availability (or otherwise) of ATMs.

Personally on recent trips to the US and Western Europe I've relied on the above 2 methods and not bothered buying and cash beforehand, but if you decide want or need to get money before you go then shop around - as with anything else you might buy the prices of foreign currency vary. The internet is your friend :)

**BUYING TICKETS**  
For a short trip you would generally book a return flight of some sort.  This may be a requirement for some countries (it's evidence you intend to leave rather than vanish and become an illegal immigrant) and you really don't want to waste time on your holiday hunting for return travel.

Finding a good deal on plane fares is a black art and there are far better people than me to advise you on it.  Again, the internet has a gajillion sites for booking travel (and accommodation, and car hire, and ...).  On the other hand as /u/wallyflops has already mentioned just because you can DIY doesn't mean you have to or should.  There are people out there who will help you with the legwork for a price.

**VISAS**  
This varies. As a Brit there are many countries we can visit as tourists without needing a visa or where obtaining a visa is a formality.  Inside the EU visas are not required.  The US does not require a visa but does require you to apply online in advance and pay a fee (because terror!).  Again this is something you'd need to research once you have some destinations in mind. 

**PASSPORTS**

You now have to attend an interview when applying for your first adult passport (again, because terror!).  Wasn't like that in my day so all I can do is point you to the [official information](https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-adult-passport/your-passport-interview).

AIUI the interview is aimed at checking you are who you say you are.  The citizenship test is a different thing which is for foreign nationals applying for British citizenship.  As (I assume) a British citizens applying for a passport it shouldn't apply for you.

Hope that helps.  Good luck &amp; bon voyage!",0,1399705634,null,0,false,0,cheaxl3,t3_256trj,t1_cheaxl3,t3_256trj,null,1433732992,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

The Gallimaufry on Gloucester Road (a bit further up the same road as the Canteen) is also really cool, probably more like the sort of 'bar' I'd imagine you'd have in the States - it tends to serve cocktails and such so doesn't have the best selection of beer, and also has a live DJ on a weekend, can make for a great atmosphere on a friday night.

Similar to chelsea who just start subbing on striker after striker.

Also Sturridge clearly has attitude/anxiety or whatever issues, he gets greedy and has a horrible touch at times, even more so in the second half. I know he gets subbed off a lot and we tend to play more defensively, but there is clearly more than that to explain why 2/3 of his goals were in the first half of the game. Having another striker that could replace him here (as opposed to having another striker to play with 2 ST when he is injured) when he starts doing this would be good as well.

I found Spain and France easy places to get cash with my cards and the Netherlands difficult, so if I go to the Netherlands again I'll preconvert and take cash. 

**Tickets**: I buy plane tickets online, deciding first how much I can afford to pay and then balancing comfort against price. I also used to check reviews for airlines. Disable cookies before shopping around for plane tickets and hotels, as some sites will raise the price when you come back to it a second time as you have now most likely decided to buy and won't notice the jump. Buy plane tickets at least two weeks before travelling unless there is a pressing need to leave the country urgently. 

**Visas**: Anywhere in the EU, you can just grab your passport and go. Other places may need a visa. Search for 'visiting (country)' and you should find a site explaining what visas are needed and how to get them.

**Once you are there**: Before going to a country where the first language is not English, learn at least a few phrases. 'I don't understand,' 'Do you speak English,' 'Yes,', 'No,', 'Please', 'Thank you' and 'I'm sorry' as a bare minimum. Find out how your chosen city is pronounced, and your hotel and the street it is on.

He is a million times better with the ball at his feet and although he hasn't been as creative and has horrible finishing, I don't think that Lallana as a player is much better, especially given that he is already 26, and is at or is entering the prime of his career.

Stat for stat, keeping mind that Lallana has played quite a few more games, Lallana has lost the ball 90 times, which is a TON. Coutinho makes a similar amount of runs and has lost just half that with 45. For reference, most AMs/Strikers fall between 40-60. Coutinho also creates about the same as Lallana, which I'm sure you can imagine, is pretty tough to believe given his form earlier in the season, also a even bigger factor IMO, Coutinho has created 12 ""big chances"" compared to Lallana's.

Also not to be dismissed is Coutinho's work rate, he definitely doesn't do this every game, but the home fixtures against City and Arsenal were very impressive, applying a ton of pressure and winning the ball back a number of times. Obviously these are two different players in different systems with different players around them, but I personally don't see Lallana being that much better than Coutinho if at all.

People are just massively overrating Lallana, because he is at an average club and he is a decent player. Had he done the same at United or another top club, people wouldnt say much about him, especially a player who is 26 (today). 

If we can sign him for ~12m, then great, lets go for it. If not, I would be very hesitant, anything above 20m would be too much for a 26 y.o rotation player.

true,ZombieWomble,null,null,"&gt; Is any other NHS treatment barred from people in NI? 

That's not *quite* the context of this ruling. Each of the devolved regions of the UK has responsibility for their own healthcare provision (and, indeed, below that different trusts are responsible for their own catchment area). The NHS in England has no particular responsibility to provide standard healthcare provision for someone normally resident in N. Ireland (or vice versa). 

There are two main conditions where they would, however - emergency medical treatment and referrals. The former is obvious, the latter is used when specialised equipment or skills are needed and allows for people to be transferred by doctors for medical treatment both within the UK and outside, but it will end up being billed back to the NI NHS eventually.

Neither of these work for abortion, though. We already have provision for abortions in the case of health emergencies here, and doctors here can't generate a referral for a non-emergency abortion because it's illegal. So there's no way to get into the English healthcare system, so there are no ""rights"" to abortions on the NHS there. 

This is a direct consequence of the structure of the NHS and devolution, and seems to be legally the correct (and only practical) decision, even if it's a terrible burden on these women.

Playing dumb is Alan's job but then again Alan frequently makes some of the most brilliant observations I have seen on the show. Johnny Vegas plays dumb without having anything witty to say. I used to actually feel sorry for him before reading that he just plays dumb and isn't really.

I believe QI's guests need rapport and wit to be successful. Having an immense amount of knowledge is of no use as we all know from Rory McGrath / John Sessions. Johnny has good rapport but no wit. 

Sean Lock doesn't really come across as knowledgeable and is maybe lacking in the rapport department a bit but he has a wit as sharp as a sword! 

David Mitchell works wonders because he has a unique ability to package his immense knowledge as wit and man he is eloquent when he goes off on his rants.

Alan is a GOD at what Stephen accurately described as a out-of-the-box way of looking at things.

Bill Bailey : Excellent rapport (being friends IRL with Alan) and wit.

Jimmy Carr: Razor sharp wit. Probably the quickest of them all.

I truly believe the above 5 (plus Stephen Fry of course) have kept the show fresh after all these years. Keep picking from this group and add guests like Daniel Radcliffe and Brian Cox and the show is bound to have maximum potential.

Other notable mentions:
Jo Brand : I used to really like her initially but her jokes about her husband have become very very predictable.

Sandy Toksvig : Great knowledge, great rapport, not very witty.

Rich Hall : I didn't like him in my first viewings of QI but I realized that although he doesn't say much, when he does it is gold.

Dara OBrien : Great knowledge, great rapport, not very witty.

Rob Brydon : A good dose of rapport and wit. 

And finally, for an inexplicable reason, I hate shows with Phil Jupitus.

The way I've imagined this in the past is of the directors of the UK subsidiary of Starbucks telling their American owners, ""sorry, we're rebranding all our stores because Costa offered us a better deal"".

Let's say I'm American, I make Über brand guitar amplifiers and I want to sell them in the UK - to have a UK-based distributor and sales &amp; marketing departments. They have to be an independent franchise - I now can't just come over here, open an office and visit music stores promoting my product, but instead I have to convince a British business or entrepreneur that I have a good product, and that it'll be profitable for them to license my brand. He will presumably want some reassurance that the effort he puts in to launching the brand will have some returns, and that I won't take the franchise away from him once he makes the brand popular and award it to someone else. So we might agree a 5 or 10 year contract - what's to stop him running my brand into the ground during that time?

- anything on the triangle (e.g. Lizard Lounge) and on Park Street, it's super annoying loud pop music, long queues and superwasted early 20s students. Unless you relish that sort of thing. But seriously laaaaaaaame music and ""DJs""

Seeing as the UK doesn't issue national identity cards, a Briton without a passport can't pass the UK border.

You use it just like a debit card but you usually get free cash withdrawals from ATMs abroad. If the card gets stolen then you can cancel it just like a debit card. Generally it's cheaper than using you're debit card but safer than cash. Make sure you carry some cash with you when you arrive, you will need cash for things like taxis from the airport. 

**insurance**   If you are travelling in Europe (EU) then get an EHIC card, it's free and will cover basic health care while your there.

**Airports/luggage**  make sure that you check the restrictions on what you can have in your hand luggage before you go! You can only have 100ml of liquid and no sharp objects, aerosols etc are restricted. These things can go in you hold luggage but it's best to sore it at home rather then at the airport.

The restrictions are usually made pretty clear when you book, and are always available on the airlines website, so check before you travel.

The halal thing is certainly a non-story, I posted a long-ass comment somewhere yesterday about it. The people complaining about supermarkets and big chain restaurants serving halal are not eating meat that was brutally slayed, they're eating meat that was killed in the same or other equally humane manner as regular meat, except the animals were read a prayer and blessed before they died.

We've already established in other threads that people in the UK generally aren't really religious, we're not actual Christians, we only lean that way culturally, so now everyone is claiming to be upset that their burgers and chicken nuggets got a muslim blessing? Bollocks. Tuck in, I say. 

There's very few places serving halal meat from animals that weren't stunned, and they're likely to be small independent muslim butchers, it certainly isn't at Tesco or Subway, and the people moaning certainly aren't buying their meat there. The papers are indeed picking and choosing what to print to generate the maximum hate for muslims/Islam, it's disgusting and unnecessary.

I love Sakho at the back, I know he can be haphazard at times and extremely rash but he's not a player any striker in the world wants to face. He gets right up close and yeah he might get turned sometimes but more often than not that pressure will cause them to panic and lose the ball.  

Caulker and Sakho would be my preferred pairing, since I think one of Agger and Skrtel will be leaving in summer, most likely to Napoli.

If every one took the attitude that a vote for a non mainstream party is a waste then we would just be living in a 2 or 3 party system.

The European elections are a list PR system so every vote really does count as it's not a one candidate takes all situation. Even in the general election a vote to an outside party is valuable. Election data isn't just for who has won, it is analysed for trends and to see where support is going and what policies the main parties may have to adapt to. This is why UKIP are having such influence, people have voted for a outside party along with the media attention and now the centre right are working to coax those supporters back through adopting and centralizing their more acceptable policies.

I wouldn't say that at all. I earn a very similar amount and save quite a bit. Beyond the ""social spending"" our expenses are quite similar. My alternative to that is that I have some inexpensive hobbies mostly based around exercise and cooking (eating in! and eating left overs for lunch at work). But with that I'm able to put £125 into my employee share scheme, a similar amount into my pension while still saving a decent amount for an emergency fund/used car fund. 

It's the social spending and unaccounted for money that's causing the issues. Eliminate a lot of these (and by this I mean basically change your lifestyle in order to **survive**) and then continue doing so to build an emergency fund and eventually a house deposit fund if that's the route you're going to take.

Also like most immigrants of her age, she's quite socially conservative. If you compare UKIP policies to a Congress or BJP one from India, it's not really that radically different. Apart from the NHS, there's a strong aversion to the 'benefits culture' as opposed to the 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps' philosophy she was taught by her parents.

It would be impossible and illegal to withdraw the  passport of a British citizen within the UK without them holding a secondary citizenship, as to do so would render them stateless.


It is far easier to do it to a British passport holder who is already overseas.  
Simply cancel their UK passport and refuse them entry to the UK.

That is why a lot of fringe radical Muslims, or those accused of being radical, are often very unwilling to leave the UK to visit family in Pakistan, etc, for fear that once they are out of the country they will have their passport revoked and never be allowed back in.

true,wessexboyofsidney,null,null,"Welcome to Bristol!

Hard to know exactly what you're after, in Bristol there's something for everyone, but I'll throw in a few names that may not have come up yet. Far from an exhaustive list, mind you...

**Drinking**

* Cider.
A must if you want a Bristolian drink. A decent pub should have a good local one on tap. Black rat is a favourite of mine, but the best two places to try a range of ciders is the **Coronation Tap** in Clifton Village, and **The Apple**, a floating cider barge in the centre.

* Cocktails.
If you like a *really* good (and appropriately pricey) drink, or would like to impress a certain someone who likes really good drinks, go to **Hausbar** on the top of Whiteladies road. German speakeasy style place with friendly and extremely knowledgable bartenders. If you want recommendations for other places, they'll happily give advice, places they may mention might include **Goldbrick House** or **The Rummer**. Hausbar is easily my favourite though.

* Pubs in general.
You're spoilt for choice on this one, like any good town Bristol has hundreds, so do some exploring around where you live and you should find a good one. For a particularly Bristolian view, the beer garden of **The White Lion** at the Avon Gorge hotel looks out over the Clifton Suspension Bridge and is lovely. Two of the most historic pubs in Bristol are opposite one another, the **Llandoger Trow** was frequented by Robert Louis Stevenson and Daniel Defoe and is worth a look, and **The Old Duke** opposite is a great Jazz Pub with a lovely atmosphere and great music. Speaking of music...



**Music &amp; Theatre**

* Larger venues for orchestras/bands/comedians etc.
Your best bets here are **The Colston Hall**, and **The Bristol Hippodrome**. This is where you'll find the biggest shows that come to Bristol, with both venues showing famous comedians, the former showing orchestras and the biggest bands, and the latter showing plays, ballets etc.

* Other theatres.
Just down the road from the Llandoger Trow and Old Duke is the **Bristol Old Vic** a  very well respected theatre and acting school (John Hurt trained there), The Old Vic is the other major theatre in Bristol (along with the Hippodrome). There are of course plenty of smaller theatres, including **The Redgrave Theatre** and others, but the Hippodrome and the Old Vic are your best bets.

* Other venues.
For bands too small to play the Colston Hall (but still attracting some really great names if that's your thing) there is the **Bristol O2 Academy** just off Park Street. A great venue, with some fantastic names always cropping up. Another venue worth considering is **Thekla**, a boat venue not far from The Apple mentioned earlier. This attracts some of the more up-and-coming acts, but it's always worth seeing who's on. Of course, there are loads of pubs and bars all around who are always having acts on here and there, but I'll just name one more; **The Louisiana** is known for doing a lot of live music, so that's worth a look.



**Eating**
I'm not one for great gastronomy, but there are a few I'd recommend...

* For a great steak, go to **The Cowshed** on Whiteladies road. Supplied by the butchers Ruby &amp; White next door, their meat is really very good.

* For the best burger in Bristol, try **The Burger Joint** opposite the Cowshed. Also supplied by Ruby &amp; White, these burgers are fantastic.

* I haven't yet been to this one, but I've heard good things. **The Stable** on the harbourside is a simple place, serving Pizza, Pies and Cider. Simple stuff, apparently done well.

Okay, I've been going on for a while now, and should probably do some real work. If this gets a good response, I could edit in some more suggestions when I have time. I hope you like Bristol!!!

We've seen with things like the unfair dismissal appeals that the government couldn't give two shits about workers rights, and I'd imagine they would go further if we left the EU.

Of course it isn't a hard and fast rule, and what the business does depends on whether they support British membership of the EU, but when you hear businesses and MPs complain about EU regulations, it's often regulations that mean they don't make as much money, but have to protect workers rights and can't dump all their waste into rivers.

The statement suggested by Collymore would make Lerner look so weak. It would create serious uncertainty. Any manager or player that might have joined Villa would hold off until a deal is done. The value people would be willing to pay for the club would drop, because they know Lerner is desperate to sell. Lerner might have made some wrong decisions but he's not stupid. 


If none of the local journalists know for sure, and the manager doesn't know, and better connected ex Villa players like Ian Taylor don't know, then Stan Collymore sure as hell doesn't know.


All we can do is look at the evidence. Villa have always denied takeover rumours very quickly. An article in the Sun came out in February suggesting we were up for sale and there was an official response from Faulkner straight away categorically denying the club was for sale. But in April, when an article came out saying a £200 million deal was in place to an American consortium if we stayed up, the club did not deny it. Instead Lerner, who hasn't spoken in years, made a vague statement with absolutely no denial. Ever since, whilst takeover rumours grow like wildfire, the club have gone completely silent and very secretive.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"&gt;I wanted to ask about that firstly. Do you normally just do the conversion in the UK and take money with you, or can you not just take your debit or credit card and use that abroad when you need to access money?

You can either change currency here before you go at a higher conversion rate, or you can change it in your destination country, but that will be at a lower rate, so you will get fewer $ (or whatever) for your £. 

You can use your credit or debit cards abroad most of the time, but check with your bank or credit card company to be sure. Bear in mind though that you will be charged a conversion fee every time you use it, because the bank/card company has to convert the money and pay in the local currency.

&gt; I've no idea about conversions to be honest. I've never needed to know.

When you convert money, the £ you give in return for $ (or whatever) are not fixed - you don't get $1 per £1 because of the differences in the values of the $ compared to our £ - the amount you pay for a loaf of bread, for instance, is usually used as one of many indexes to work out what the difference is between the values of the currencies. 

Then the shop that does the conversion will either take a payment from you (commission) for trading the money, or they will give you slightly fewer $s (or whatever) per £ that you give them as a different form of fee.

And when you return you can sell your unused $s (or whatever) back to these places for £s - but this will be at a slightly worse ratio than when you brought the $ in the first place because they can't use the money over here - it's basically shop stock that they have to sell again.

So when you go to get your money exchanged, have a shop around for the best deal - you are looking to get as many $s as you can per £. And of course make sure you shop around when you return your unused $s - you can go to anywhere else with a better deal to return it.

&gt; Also, how do you usually buy the tickets for your plane? Do you buy return tickets at the same time? I don't really know how that works. 

You can either go to a travel agents (who may have a better deal as they can get bulk prices) or you can buy from the website of the airline you want to travel with. Again, shop around for the best deal, and bear in mind prices go up the closer you get to the date of travel so book early. And shop around - foreign carriers might have a better deal, and you can go for low-frills airlines if you want as well although these will have fewer amenities and probably worse legroom etc. The low-cost airlines might also go to airports further away from your destination city as well as they tend to have lower landing charges.

As for return tickets, most visas require you to have one that you can produce upon entry to prove you have a set date to return on - the USA definitely won't let you in without a return ticket.

&gt; Also how do visas work? 

Depends on the country you wish to visit. Most of the time you go to the embassy of the country you wish to apply to, fill in some forms, give them whatever info they need, and they review it and respond.

Some countries like the USA however have visa waiver programs for certain nations - the USA will let a brit in for up to 90 days without a visa - all you have to do is pre-register your visit on their website within plenty of time of your visit (a few months I think) and then fill in a landing card that will be handed to you on the plane. As long as you don't have a criminal record or are a member of a terrorist organisation, or have ever done drugs, you will be let in without a visa.

&gt; Do you need one even if you are only visiting a country for a few days? 

Most of the time, yes.

&gt; Also, do you need to go for an interview to get a passport? 

No, you can get passport application forms from the post office - you just have to post the form and a set of photos and they do the rest. 

It may take a few months though so make sure you do it well in advance.

Also consider that some countries require your passport to be in-date for a certain period *after* you leave their country - the USA for instance requires people to arrive with passports that don't expire for three months after the end date of your visit (I think three months is right).


&gt; A while back I heard about some kind of citizenship test being implemented where you get asked a bunch of silly questions about the UK when you are getting a passport. Did anyone here have to do that?

That only applies for people wishing to become British Citizens, it is not a requirement for a passport.

&gt; I hope this won't be seen as unpatriotic or anything. I'm quite happy in the UK. I've seen most of the important sights and landmarks, etc. There's a lot of the world that I haven't seen though and I'd like to start while I'm still relatively young and healthy.

It's great that you want to see the world, and it's not unpatriotic at all. No person can truly appreciate what they have unless they have seen how others live. :-)

true,religionisanger,null,null,"Long reply... Sorry I've got a thing for rabbiting on about shares.

Anything paying dividend is generally considered pretty safe; most of the ftse 100 shares are fairly safe and pay reasonable dividend, there are also AIM shares - these are new companies and highly volotile (they go up and down by massive jumps). The cost of buying AIM shares is also higher. People can get very lucky with AIM though, for example - my dad purchased a small amount of a share called [zytronic](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/z/zytronic-ordinary-1p) who jumped by some 20% in a day providing him with huge amounts of money (but he had to sell them instantly as the volatility with AIM is likely).

You can also setup prices to automatically buy/sell at, taking away the human element (people get attached to shares when they initially start trading and keep hold of shares which do shit, and like wise - keep highly successful ones, which inevitably may not continue doing well).

There are essentially three types of shares; stable ones which go up and down very little - they generate income via dividend and most account providers can do something called DRIP which a certain level of dividend is reached (this is £200 with my current account provider). Medium stability ones (they may not necessarily generate income at all) and highly unstable ones, new companies etc. The stability should reflect how long you intend to hold on to them; e.g the moment an AIM share shoots up, sell it, if your shares are meant for dividend only, unless they're highly successful suddenly (as was the case for [astraxeneca](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/a/astrazeneca-plc-ordinary-us$0.25) ).

Ones which are fairly stable, up and coming shares - [ashtead](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/a/ashtead-group-plc-ordinary-10p) are a good example of this, they are providing small amounts of dividend but it's doubled since last year, they're successful and likely to continue doing well (but medium risk) - they may also be new to the market and not providing dividend (shares such as [royal mail](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/r/royal-mail-plc-ordinary-gbp0.01) and [ARM](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/a/arm-holdings-plc-ordinary-0.05p) are good examples of this; although I think ARM is now a FTSE 250 share). Pets at home and pound land will be in this category (not yet floated). Shares when they're first floated on the stock market are meant to be accurately priced, if this pricing is inaccurate (as was the case with royal mail), there's a potential for lots of money to be made. E.g royal mail were undervalued by some 50% (rough guess).

Then the ones which are highly volatile and the number of share holders literally suggests whether or not they will be successful. I have shares in a company called [judges scientific](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/j/judges-scientific-plc-ord-shares) which are considered AIM, there shares shift about and I automatically buy (providing I have the funds) and sell at specific prices (this generates lots of money alone). They tend to be cheaper, although this isn't always the case.

I use a share provider called [hargreaves lansdown](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares), they charge around a tenner per trade, no stamp duty on shares that are AIM and have some funds which maybe interesting for people seeking stability (very boring - they're basically money in multiple shares, go up 0.X a day but make around 20% a year). I'd recommend (in terms of stable shares); [unilever](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/u/unilever-plc-ordinary-3.11p), [national grid](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/n/national-grid-ordinary-11,1743p), [diageo](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/d/diageo-plc-ordinary-28-101108p), [GSK](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/g/glaxosmithkline-plc-ordinary-25p) (these feature on lots of ""shares to retire on"" lists), [bats](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/b/british-american-tobacco-plc-ordinary-25p) is another good one. Google can provide you with a list of good stable shares. Lots of people have public lists of 2014 their ""portfolios"" (all the shares they're interested in or have invested in for that year). Bankers etc have these on [hargreaves lansdown](http://www.hl.co.uk/news/articles)

Some other points; people reckon the ftse might reach 7000 this year, generally if the ftse does well - so do all the other shares (this obviously isn't always accurate), so now is a decent time to invest. Always buy on a dip, never eagerly buy when a shares high. Don't get emotionally involved, just sell/buy at set points and try to stick to it (not true for ones which just pay dividend). Don't look back if you decide to sell when a share is doing well (often they continue doing well). Also, it's better to invest big as the percentage increase is more substantial. My rule has generally been buy/sell at around 15% if possible. Oh and one final thing! As it reaches the end of the tax year, shares shoot up a lot as people invest their 12k into the stock exchange.",0,1399723911,null,0,1399725600,0,chedsjt,t3_252iyd,t1_chedsjt,t1_chdq4td,null,1433734339,0,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,0

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"&gt;*Many issues are far more complex than the public has the time or (dare I say it) intellectual capacity to deal with. That's why we pay politicians.*

You might enjoy re-reading:-

&gt;*The early apples were now ripening, and the grass of the orchard was littered with windfalls*. The animals had assumed as a matter of course that these would be shared out equally; one day, however, the order went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected and brought to the harness-room for the use of the pigs. *At this some of the other animals murmured, but it was no use. All the pigs were in full agreement on this point, even Snowball and Napoleon*. Squealer was sent to make the necessary explanations to the others.

&gt;""Comrades!"" he cried. ""You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually dislike milk and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig. *We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for YOUR sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples*. Do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty? Jones would come back! Yes, Jones would come back! Surely, comrades,"" cried Squealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and whisking his tail, ""surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back?""

&gt;Now if there was one thing that the animals were completely certain of, it was that they did not want Jones back. When it was put to them in this light, they had no more to say. *The importance of keeping the pigs in good health was all too obvious. So it was agreed without further argument that the milk and the windfall apples (and also the main crop of apples when they ripened) should be reserved for the pigs alone.*

~ George Orwell, **Animal Farm** (1945)

&gt;*If you want to see how stupid a directly democratic Britain would look*

[How direct democracy makes Switzerland a better place](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435383/How-direct-democracy-makes-Switzerland-a-better-place.html)

&gt;*While it embraces direct democracy, Switzerland is nevertheless still a representative democracy. Most laws are made and decided by parliament. The important difference, however, between the Swiss system and the ""indirect"" democracy of Britain is that citizens are entitled to put almost every law decided by their representatives to a general vote - if they want.*

It's a continuum not a binary choice.

&gt;*That's why Farage frames the EU debate in terms of sovereignty, democracy and national pride, rather than the complicated economic situation it is.*

Facts on Democratic Deficit of the UK while it has been in the EU:-

* You need to have a referendum / vote to the public on the issue of loss of sovereignty. Currenty that is running in arrears of 40 years and at least &gt;5 Major Treaties along with &gt;15 promises of referendums from multiple politicians.
* Democratically: x1 referendum in 40 years = in 2015 &lt;58yo has never voted and anyone new to the country &gt;1975 has never voted which is &gt;50% of the population of 64m ie &gt;32m people have never voted.
* Major Treaties include: 

1. Single European Act 1986-1987
2. Maastricht Treaty 1992-1993
3. Amsterdam Treaty 1997-1999
4. Nice Treaty 2001-2003
5. Lisbon Treaty 2007-2009

&gt;*""First, the crisis over the impossibility to ratify the* **Constitutional Treaty** *that began in 2005 and which was only overcome with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009.""* ~ José Manuel Durão Barroso, President of the European Commission, Berlin, 8 May 2014",0,1399725155,null,0,false,0,chee1q9,t3_2578vm,t1_chee1q9,t1_chedni4,null,1433734459,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,chromofoam,uk,Hertfordshire,"Well, the law states that if the agent says or writes something in the advert, OR omits something which has 'a material effect on the transactional decision' of a buyer or tenant (i.e. if there's something they hid or altered, or something you didn't see that they should have otherwise pointed out) then they have broken the law and can be sued under CPR Regs.

So next time an agent states this, remind them they're on thin f*cking ice!  A quick mention of The Property Ombudsman and Powys County Council (took over from the OFT in policing agents misdemeanours) should be enough to put them in check. If it's some 17 year old with too much hair gel and pointy shoes, then I'd run as fast as you can because if they don't know about this law they shouldn't be selling or renting houses and the company they work for is probably riddled with corruption.

You're better off in those instances paying £6 to get the owners details from the Land Registry and offering to buy the house once the Sole Agency period has expired, or offer to pay half the agents fees if they'll come down on the price a little (because the agent will still pursue the seller for a fee if they find out that somebody they introduced goes on to purchase the property).

The industry is absolutely peppered with people who either are very dishonest OR they just don't know what they're doing, or a deadly combination of the two. You're better off dealing with a small independent as they'll have a much bigger reason to do a good job because bad reviews will kill them off, and it's more likely that the senior staff will be highly experienced and/or qualified - check whether they have ARLA or NAEA qualifications, what professional affiliations they have - ask if they're insured. Don't feel uncomfortable doing so, because you have a right as a consumer to be protected, especially when dealing with such gargantuan sums of money.

Also you'll note, the issue they are trying to deal with is what are called DNA's, did not attends.

Hell ever wonder why you've had to wait what seems like a unreasonably long time for a simple appointment. The scale of DNA's plays a big part.

Cash ISAs (it's important to make the distinctionhere), specifically zero notice ones, give a guaranteed return each month (albeit small), and have very small entry requirements (opening deposit of £1, NI number)

Premium Bonds pay no interest, and have a slightly higher entry requirements (minimum purchase £100, longer lead time from application to actually getting them), but have the potential to pay larger than ISAs do, because of the prize fund. That said, you'd need to invest at least £25000 to get an effectively guaranteed ""interest"" each month, due to the odds per bond of actually winning. They apparently have a slightly wonky way of returning both prizes and bond money (although, as I've never had any, I can't say for sure if that's confirmed or not)

ISAs also do have the advantage of there being different types and durations. Many banks and building societies will do both instant access, and ""bonded"" ISAs. Bonded ISAs are effectively 3-7 year investments, where your money is tied up for that period (some allow for partial or complete exits with fees), but the money does work **much** more efficiently than in instant access. You also have regular saving accounts, which you have a standing order to pay in, but can pay higher than instant access, irregular ones.

Also with ISAs, you have a Stocks and Shares one, where you basically provide up to £15000 per year into a fund, and they manage a portfolio for you. Fees vary, but because it's linked to the investments that the fund makes, you ***REALLY*** need to speak to an IFA about them, as they'll look at your attitude to risk profile.

Do you feel that the Euromaidan protests were hijacked by the Right sector and Svoboda? The Early protests seemed to be a broader coalition of people with genuine concerns and grievances. What is support like for these Fascist groups? Do people Really believe they are the answer?

How do people feel about the [Expansion of Ukraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine-growth.png) over the years? Does this complicate things?
How do the competing nationalist thought deal with it?

My worry is that there are similarities with the breakup of Yugoslavia. Arbitrary Hatred and ethnic strife deliberately exacerbated by the [EU and US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEYQ46gH08) (please note; this video was made from a Serbian perspective but the overall economics behind the conflict are pretty accurate). 

The only hope for Ukraine is for a people led movement to put an end to the Madness. Do not put you hopes in Russia, the EU or the US. They view you as pawns and do not have your interests at heart. Root out the malign influence of fascism, they can only make things worse.

It's simply another direct tax that goes to healthcare, its in many ways the foundation of their far superior system as it allows provision to track need as opposed to simly assigning a budget before the fact to the trust then having them try to predict the possible need.

I simply brought it up for sake of completeness, its a nominal fee. The structure is simply different as the French system in terms of claiming is a bit antiquated. Having it automatically claimed and refurnded against a national insurance would be easily possible these days. 

Point simply is, France has this system. Whilst the implementation details are different, the mere fact that you have a nominal fee of say 10£, does not sigificantly restrict access to healthcare. We could easily implement a claim back procedure, and their number of frivelous visists and DNA's are drastically lower than ours, meaning their effectively deployable resources as a ratio of total resources is also higher than ours.

true,Ivebeenfurthereven,cnty-uk,"Living by the sea [Southampton via Sussex, Southsea and Swansea]","That's a valid point in a cost-of-living crisis, not to mention how essential a cheap supply of electricity is to keep manufacturing and business competitive and successful, and I don't think you deserve to be downvoted for what you've said. 

But the price of fossil fuels is only shooting up, because the easy oil and gas fields have been worked, and exploration is going to increasingly difficult, extreme sources (like deepwater drilling, which wasn't economic until the oil price shot up) to meet the booming demand of humanity for energy. If we don't get renewable costs down now while we're still benefitting from relatively cheap oil and gas, what's going to happen in fifty years when the country can't afford a generous slice of the world's remaining supplies? There may be lots of fossil fuels left, but they may also be very expensive to get at. Fracking and tar sands are not a bad example - it's only being considered because cheaper, simpler gas fields in the North Sea are nearly empty. On the other hand, estimates could be incorrect, and maybe there's not enough left for us and the wildly growing nations like China to keep using forever. And when you consider that crude oil produces other products absolutely essential to modern life - plastics, and chemical feedstocks used to make all kinds of medical drugs - why the hell are we wasting so much of it burning it forever? 

I would argue we should copy France's 20th-century energy policy, and aim to go 50%+ nuclear to make sure we have LOTS of cheap electricity (eg, for millions of electric cars and lorries). But the politicians refuse to deliver the wave of new power stations that we'd need, so the essentials of life in the UK are dangerously wedded to volatile fossil fuel wholesale prices. [This is before we even touch on the major underinvestment issue - many power stations are set to retire soon, but replacements have not been built fast enough, and the country potentially faces regular blackouts by the end of this decade](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/6118161/Third-World-rolling-blackouts-warning-as-Government-admits-power-shortfalls.html). 

In the meantime, scaling up renewables makes a whole lot of sense, because saving money by not putting a small tax towards doing it today is going to hurt like hell when fossil fuel prices surge in future.

Ukraine is just being used by the US as another pawn. Look at Syria (were Russia has a very important, (symbolically and tactically) military base), the US &amp; UK have been feeding extremists weaponry over there for years now, with the aim of overthrowing the pro-Russia gov, if those same rebels enter Turkey and attack anything, their terrorists, they enter any other anti-US country, they're freedom fighters. 
Russia is on to this however, quickly securing their naval base in Crimea, and galvanising the pro-Russian eastern part of Ukraine. All in all, Russia has out-foxed the US, democratically, and tactically, these last few years, they are not winning however, Russia has been *for decades now* on the defensive.

The EU &amp; UN are just puppet organisations for the US in all honesty (what sanctions were taken over the illegal middle east wars, for example?).

*Anyways, to answer your questions*
1) It is extremely easy to make a random peaceful community hate each other, one of the most common ways is through propaganda. In Britain, when Ireland &amp; Britain were at each others throats we had [this](http://imgur.com/a/6Wqg5#0) portraying us as savage idiots. Over in eastern parts of Ukraine at the moment you guys have pro-EU parts of Ukraine being branded as neo-nazis etc. In the Ireland &amp; Britain case it was to garner support and hatred (allowing brutality later on), in Ukraine it is much the same, but of course it has to *divide* the population first.

2) Do I think the situation in Ukraine is going to worsen? Unfortunately, *yes*.
I don't think the US has anyones human rights at heart, as much as they say so. (Guantanamo, Bagram, and other secret CIA torture prisons throughout eastern Europe etc). The US, through provocative measures is exacerbating the troubles there, most likely behind closed doors they are responsible for the current military actions against the civilian population of eastern Ukraine at the moment. There is lots of evidence of their tampering during the initial uprising.
Military killing civilians will divide the population further, pushing a peaceful solution away, which will make civil war easier to attain, which will make Putin &amp; Russia look bad (US secondary objective complete), civil war will make Kiev/Western Ukraine rely on the West (US/UK) more, giving them more control (Primary objective complete).

His record in Italy sticks out as well, and has enjoyed good comparative results from relegation bound teams to Inter Milan. Great league record and cup record there. 

When looking at De Boer, the Dutch league is arguably at an all time low in terms of quality of opposition, but he has still managed some horrendous results along with his consecutive titles. A 4-0 loss to PSV, they did poorly against PEC, and a 6-0 agg score vs Salzburg coming in Europe. Having spoken to a few Ajax fans it seems like the style of FdB is remarkably similar to AVB. Ajax struggle to play well against teams that press well and in an organised fashion, and they also struggle to break down opponents parking the bus. And like AVB FdB plays 4-3-3 regardless, and is fairly stubborn in terms of tactics. 

Teams coming in to play against Ajax with a specific plan will tend to ruffle a few feathers, however FdB obviously has some great credentials too. The barca game springs to mind with his league titles. What I think needs to be done is for FdB to show his credentials outside of the Dutch league. The competition isn't great yet in many games there seems to be issues. Whereas Mancini has proven his worth in various leagues and different club situations. 

edit: I think its naive to pin one manager as the ""saviour"" of a club. I'm sure FdB could do very well at Spurs, but don't get your hopes up, there are other alternatives.

When you see such a teacher in a class, it is a thing to behold - a teacher that can gain the respect of even the most pernicious miscreant - but for most it's just way outside of most teachers' life experience to deal with.

I don't think corporal punishment is the answer though - I think the school curriculum needs to be revised into teaching character and real life skills...

Forcing a kid with low attention span and penchant for violence and vandalism to simply drift through a standard curriculum, disrupting as they go, does nothing for the teachers, the kid, his peers or society. Taking that kid out of the standard curriculum and placing them in a curriculum that teaches them primarily how to handle their anger and frustration, deal with real world problems (abuse, poverty etc...) at home along with some basic maths/English skills is probably going to do a lot more for everyone including them, when they finally get released on the public at aged 16.",0,1399731113,null,0,false,0,chefiq5,t3_2578p8,t1_chefiq5,t1_chef4yy,null,1433735220,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Book a return flight.

You'll most likely not need a visa. I've travelled to 14 countries and needed one once. For the US there's an electronic permit you need to sort out first though. Usually this can be done online. Be careful though - a lot of official looking sites aren't actually the official site for a country's visa scheme.

Visas: If travelling within the EU then you don't need a visa (if travelling in the Schengen area (all the EU countries (plus a few others) apart from the UK and Ireland). Other countries may require a visa. See the Foreign Office website for info (www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice) on each country.

Citizenship test: Only foreigners wanting to become a UK citizen need to take the test, you don't if you want a passport and are a UK citizen. To get a passport for the first time, you will need to answer a bunch of questions. More info here (www.gov.uk/apply-first-adult-passport).

Anyway, I'll say it again - I'd be fucking delirious if we get him:

- He's the right age to come in and make an impact immediately, which is what we should focus on - we already have enough young players to blossom and carry us through the medium-term future. 

- He could play any attacking midfield position, plus CM, in any of our formations - that's superb versatility, much needed given our lack of bench strength. 

- Southampton's style of football is already very similar to ours. Stylistically, that makes him as close to a 'sure thing' to succeed for us as possible.

- Even if he doesn't make the first XI all the time, he'd be a genuine game-changer off the bench.

- He's got the right attitude and mentality, evidenced by him being made club captain - for their first season back in the PL, of all times.

The only thing I'd say is, I hope we're being street-smart and have a plan B signing in mind.

How?  The only ones who'll ever see you don't pick your kid up are the staff, and those who are also late.  The on-time parents will pick them up early and go home with no knowledge of how much later the other kids are picked up.  This doesn't really seem much different.

&gt;and the financial penalty can end up like simply paying for childcare as DB said.

Yes, but that's the exact worry - that the fine will seem like paying for convenience.  Ie. making an effort to attend an appointment when something comes up becomes, ""I already paid my money, so I'm entitled to skip out.""

&gt;Many many businesses that run appointment systems

And this is exactly the issue - these are perceived as *business* transactions.  They have no social capital to begin with and the transaction is already purely financial to start with.  But often social barriers are *stronger* than financial ones, and I think these are certainly at play for many regarding the NHS.  If this is the case, it's not at all clear that discarding these for financial incentives would be a win at all, unless the financial incentives are made much higher than a token sum.

&gt;Maybe a deposit that is returned when you attend is the answer, rather than a fee.

Probably wouldn't make a difference regarding this issue (though it might be better in terms of fairness).

Well, Svoboda is one of the parties that participated in the first stage of the protests, which were advertised as non-violent. They have done a lot of nasty things back then - they beat up the members of left and far-left groups who wanted to join the protests - they were allowed to join later though, but not representing their own group. Of course Euromaidan allowed all sort of people to join it but the far-right groups had the privilege - and I personally blame Svoboda for this - for fucking up the protests and for giving Russia a chance to call the protesters neo-nazis.

Gladly the Fatherland and UDAR parties were much more liberal than that and Svoboda had no choice but to follow their agenda. Unfortunately there was a number of accidents from Svoboda's side.

I will be honest, I was close to voting for Svoboda on last elections, though I did not, and now I know I will never vote for them anymore. The main idea (which was undoubtedly supported by the EU as well, in particular by BBC) was to have non-violent protests. And it was a really great idea - though unfortunately, with time, the protesters realised that they do have the popular support in Kiev and that if they push a bit further... well, they created the self-defense which looked very funny back then, and their role was to fight off the police forces in case they try to storm the protesters camp again. Then there was automaidan who was pursuing the police vans and freeing those who were arrested, and it was maybe one of those reasons that made far-left anarchists also join the protests. Still it was slowly stirring away from the general non-violent idea, as they were targeting the oligarchs, the President, and their businesses. Nothing really violent but you know you cannot block the President on his way to his residence and make him change from his Jeep to a helo, right? On January 15 the Parliament voted for a number of absurd laws (some of them were just absurd and some of the were absurdly menacing) which banned a number of random things, mostly directed against the protests.

And this is where the Right Sector joined. Well they participated before, but they sort shunned all the way before. Now, after the law was signed, the stage of the actual violent protests started. It was performed by Right Sector and they sort of made a huge mess, burning the riot police, burning the cars, trying to make their way to the parliamentary building. One of the first killed were the Right Sector activists. At the moment even the liberal parties has managed to create the Maidan self-defense forces which did not attack the police yet but were watching it, though I guess some of them were slowly joining the Right Sector. Many of the Kiev citizens were condemned them, and officially they were called the provocateurs, while the protests leaders tried to negotiate with the President. 

At some point the negotiations failed and the Euromaidan leaders told that they accept Right Sector being a legitimate part of the protests and asked people to support them as well. One of them told that it's time for the Third Ukrainian Republic to arise and to destroy the old corrupted regime. They also told their plan how they want to do this - through the new elections throughout the country that would let the citizens of Ukraine vote for the president impeachment. That would be unofficial elections of course. Later on they never pushed with this idea. I guess they were just playing that political game, and negotiating with Yanukovich though the whole February.

Well yeah, that's how shit hit the fan. I do blame FIRST OF ALL Svoboda - for not allowing the far-left groups in Euromaidan. By the way far-left kept supporting the protests, though they had a bit different view on them, but they did support them. Right Sector had a different role, though it was rather destructive too. The protests were not literally hijacked, those were the parliamentary leaders who were controlling them all the way long, but I simply blame the leadership of the protesters, in particular those who were sympathizing the far-right groups, for allowing them to have their symbols being flied there and banning the far-left groups. Well, there were anarchists on the maidan. And anarchists do not have as strong support among Ukrainians as far-right. I think the politicians just tried to use it, to popularize themselves and prevent any anarchist groups from becoming popular, and it was incredibly selfish, and it was those politicians' selfishness that has, basically, started all the mess.",0,1399734467,null,0,false,0,chegksy,t3_2560d0,t1_chegksy,t1_chee7yu,null,1433735718,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

It does pretty much - we have the regions of Ukraine that have very different views. The Eastern Ukraine hated Western Ukraine because according to soviet propaganda West. Ukraine supported the nazis. Now, maybe they did, but this sort of propaganda made the life hell for those Western Ukrainians who decided to move to Eastern Ukraine.

I do feel there is a big difference between Western Ukrainians and for example Central Ukrainians. At the same time there is strong difference Between Donbass (Donetsk and Luhansk) citizens and Central Ukrainians as well. 

Now the differences are not that strong. Not as strong as in NI for sure. We speak the different variations of the language, though this is the point where the similarities with Yugoslavia are obvious - the difference between Croatians and Serbians is really small, they speak almost the same language, but...yeah... due to their political stance they had to choose to live separately - and this is what is going in Ukraine now too I think. It's mostly political, not an ethnic conflict, but politics can divide people just as much as ethnicity.

&gt;Do not put you hopes in Russia, the EU or the US. They view you as pawns and do not have your interests at heart
From what I see this is not possible at all these days. Like, Ukraine is too weak and the globalization tendencies are too strong - the people would prefer to live with someone big, rather than live on their own. I agree with your point of view about that it's better to be truly independent - yep, this is true. But, it's not possible really, not in modern Ukraine.

If you have online banking, copy and paste as much history as you can into Excel. Then work on identifying what spending is really unnecessary and what can be cut down on. It's amazing what comes up when you scrutinize your finances. 

The first thing that needs to go is the overdraft. It makes you very credit averse and is the key to keeping you in the poor-house. If that means constricting the social budget, then so be it. There is also no point in saving if you have debts. Everything needs to go into paying your overdrafts first. A little eBay fest or car boot sale may help here. I made £160 on my first trip to a car boot sale with, frankly, a load of old tat! I didn't do so well the second time, but the first was a complete swarm of people wanting old junk!

Second, consider if you can move somewhere cheaper to live. That's an obvious one I know, but until the overdrafts are clear, you need to be realistic

Third, can you improve your earning potential? The Open University has a tonne of courses and even if you didn't finish school, there are plenty access courses to get onto a degree path. It's not easy, takes YEARS and is a lot of sweat. But it can really help to boost your earning potential. If academia isn't right for you, then look around at other roles, determine what qualifications you need to get them, and research how you can get on that ladder... make that £24 per month Internet work for you a bit!

Forth, what's the goal here? Are you saving for a house? Are you trying to go on holiday?

Our season tickets are now among the most expensive in the league.

You will hurt your credit rating by opening a card for the purpose and closing it straight after. But, so long as there's no harm or foul, you won't feel the effects after about six months. So as long as you're not applying for a mortgage in the next six months, then you're OK.

You should also be aware that if you apply for a card and are declined, this will definitely impact your rating. I have no idea how card companies are with students these days but I would suggest not even getting into the subprime cards. Keep away from Vanquis or them other sharks. A high street name only!

Also, be wary of agreements with friends.

No one should be paying that kind of money to attend a football match.

Besides that, on a North/South divide level, people in London working an equivalent job to someone in the North West earn more. In London you pay more for everything.

Also, I recall a study done around 4 or 5 years ago which showed our fans earn the lowest on average, besides Burnley fans, of all other Premier League clubs fanbases.

Our fanbase is primarily working class.

These prices increases are hurting a lot of people in the pocket, many are being priced out altogether.

I don't think that is acceptable. Particularly given our privileged position of being the wealthiest club in the world, how can it be justified squeezing every last penny out of the core of our support, or pricing them put altogether?

Also, our individual ticket prices are among the most expensive in the league also. The cheapest adult ticket you could find against West Brom the other week would set you back £56.

&gt;Season ticket prices rise by 10% - again

The average rise is about 7%

&gt;My season ticket was £715 this season, I now have a renewal pack telling me the same seat will cost me £780 next season.

Mine is £200 cheaper than that and they aren't even in the least expensive stand.  The cheapest seat available is £299.  Mine went up by about £40, or not far off £2 match, or £13 every payment period

&gt;Our season tickets are now as expensive as United's, some tickets even more so. 

And here's the biggest amount of bullshit.  Why don't you actually tell these people the reality?  SOME OF OUR MOST EXPENSIVE TICKETS are now a little bit more expensive THAN SOME OF THEIR LOWEST TICKETS.

&gt;When ADUG bought the club we were assured continually that we, the long serving fans, wouldn't be forgotten. Khaldoon himself made a point of saying this, the truth is, these words have now proven to be hollow.

Hahahahahahaha.  Yeah that twenty million quid they've just spent on local amenities not to forget things like City Square, the low Cup price tickets, ""kids for a quid"" and the like are nothing compare to the £1 a match rise. 

&gt;That loyalty is being taken for granted now, and it won't be long until I can no longer afford to attend regularly if these price rises continue year on year. I know people who have already reached this point.

Then stop buying some of the most expensive tickets in the ground?
For those who want to know, with these prices this guy sits on the second tier of the Colin Bell or East Stand.  If he moved a single block to the right his ticket price would drop by £150 immediately.

&gt;But their places will be taken up by new fans, and casual fans, and tourists with no affinity with the club whatsoever, and everything that once made this club so special will be gone forever, for CoMS/Etihad to be become a passive and entirely sanitised atmosphere with a crowd like the Emirates or Stamford Bridge, or worse.

Listen mate, I was at Maine Road too and this is absolute shite.  The group of lads around me have been the same since we moved there and there's been no change at all in the matchgoing fans either home or away

&gt;And it leaves a really sour taste in the mouth.

Bullshit usually does.

First you thought banks (and other companies) should be forced to ban the burqa if they ban helmets in the name of equality:

&gt;I'm perfectly aware that it's company policy. Thanks. It should also be company policy for burqa wearers though. Equality and all that.

and

&gt;It's not about fashion. It's a simple matter of equality. No-one mentioned the government. Would you be willing to stand up and defend white men wearing balaclavas in public places the same as you have Asian women and the burqa? And also, why is it racist? You never answered that point.

and 

&gt;I'll add another point seeing as you didn't have the balls to reply. It is racist. It's racist in the sense that people believe only Asian women can wear the burqa and must be enabled to do this. Any other person who wishes to cover their face must be stopped. Hell, one guy even thinks wearing mankinis or ""Keep calm"" t-Shirts is tantamount to the same thing.

and

&gt;Your question was about face coverings. To be clear for you. It is discrimination but it's the sensible type. Why would anyone want to cover their face in a bank? I don't think there's anything wrong with it at all. However, I do believe if you are going to discriminate against face coverings then all should be banned. Race isn't an issue.


You've failed to respond to this question which flags up the same issue of equality which you seem to be concerned about:

&gt;Do you think it's discrimination that a lot of nightclubs ban trainers and burberry and allow shoes and other brands?

Now, unless you think nightclubs, restaurants and other establishments shouldn't be allowed to prohibit jeans, burberry or trainers your entire argument about ""equality"" breaks down. You clearly seem to think banks which prohibit helmets should be forced to ban the burqa but unless you think the same about jeans, trainers and burberry your argument doesn't make sense. 

You've also attempted to justify bans on the burqa *in general* on the grounds of ideology and security reasons:

&gt;I guess one reason would be that in the west it symbolises the oppression of one group in society. Practicality, if a crime was committed and all wore burqas, how can you identify a person?

In my experience, anyone using the term 'political correctness' without irony or as part of a discussion about the topic such as this, particularly when they perceive that they've somehow been victimised as a result of it, is trying to excuse something offensive they've said or done and appealing to tradition in order to justify it.

Yes, Mark Twain's books used the word nigger, and yes, that was the name of Guy Gibson's dog, and old cartoons frequently used stereotypes of black people that are quite distasteful, and sure - this song had the word nigger in too -- and there are plenty more examples we could probably all think of, but they all had a context that should be understood too and not removed from history to pretend they weren't there.

But that doesn't mean they're not problematic and should be placed in context and not just casually accepted as any kind of norm. It's okay for books, films, songs etc to still be read, seen, played no matter what kind of offensive language or elements they contain. But offering them needs to be owned in a way that's presenting them as examples of a changed and changing world.

EU citizenship is just a simple way of saying you have the rights to free movement of goods, services, workers and capital but obviously when you lose citizenship of an EU country leaving you stateless you therefore lose your EU citizenship too. The ECJ has said that this means the EU has the right to review cases where people are made stateless - it must be in the public interest and a proportional response. 

[This was the case. 5th paragraph is the crucial one.](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/legal_service/arrets/08c135_en.pdf) It was about a guy who lied to get German citizenship and the court said that was enough of a reason to make someone stateless so I expect terrorism is probably a good enough reason too if they can prove it - the ECJ generally gives member states a huge amount of freedom for security issues. However if the Commission thinks she's doing it gratuitously, which she might start doing now she has the power, then the Commission may sue her.

I've already addressed Value Gold, they represent less than 1% of our total seasoncard sales. They are nothing more than a token gesture designed to allow the club to lay claim to selling among the cheapest tickets in the league.

I'll give you some 'reality' if that's what you want, as I did in another part of the thread to someone as ignorant as yourself.

A Gold seasoncard in the first tier of the South Stand will cost you £585 to renew this season, if you need the loyalty points and have to go Platinum it will cost you £635.

An equivalent season ticket at Old Trafford, in the lower tier of the Streford End will cost you £532.

How about a 50-60% seasoncard price rise in 6 years for evidence those words have proven hollow?

I do not sit in the second tier, I sit in 104. That's the lower tier of the East Stand, and wasn't all that expensive until recently. So more presumptuous and ignorant rambling nonsense from yourself.

Again, just because in the area you sit people are unaffected, doesn't mean others aren't. That's ignorance at its finest. There are a number of faces I used to see around me that no longer go. I've read the comments of people on other forums who say that they won't be renewing due to being unable to justify the cost.

I know people personally that couldn't buy a season ticket and used to go to several games a season, now they go to a fraction of the amount of games they used to due to how expensive our individual tickets now are. Cup games in the early rounds of the domestic cups are the only exception to this.

I'm am not in the 'rich' section, and never have been. It was only until recently the pricing structure changed and this part of the ground became more expensive.

Should I be happy about this?

I've known most of the people around me for 10 years, I wouldn't want to move. Where would I move to given most places are oversubscribed?

Why should I have to move? This is a point about the constant increases in ticket prices at City being OTT, in my opinion.

&gt;

&gt;In May 1990, Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to Mayor [Anatoly Sobchak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Sobchak). Then, on 28 June 1991, he became head of the Committee for External Relations of the [Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_City_Administration), with responsibility for promoting international relations and foreign investments.  That Committee headed by Putin also registered business ventures.

&gt;Less than one year later, Putin was investigated by the city legislative council, and the investigators concluded that Putin had understated prices and permitted the export of metals valued at $93 million, in exchange for foreign food aid that never arrived.   Despite the investigators' recommendation that Putin be fired, Putin remained head of the Committee for External Relations until 1996.   From 1994 to 1996, Putin held several other political and governmental positions in [Saint Petersburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg).

Plenty in there talking about 6% rises, 7% rises, etc.

&gt; A Gold seasoncard in the first tier of the South Stand will cost you £585 to renew this season, if you need the loyalty points and have to go Platinum it will cost you £635.

Why would such a hardcore loyal supporter as you need a Platinum card?  I have more loyalty points than I know what to do with.

&gt;And equivalent season ticket at Old Trafford, in the lower tier of the Streford End will cost you £532.

And those people are REQUIRED to but every FA Cup ticket, every Champions League ticket and every League Cup ticket which adds hundreds and hundreds of pounds onto their ticket price.

&gt;How about a 50-60% seasoncard price rise in 6 years for evidence those words have proven hollow?

And how about the previous three years where City instituted a price freeze?

&gt;I do not sit in the second tier, I sit in 106. That's the lower tier of the East Stand, and wasn't all that expensive until recently. So more unqualified ignorant rambling nonsense form yourself.

Excellent news, then this whole thread is nonsense as you've got your ticket price wrong

http://www.mcfc.co.uk/Tickets-and-Seasoncards/Seasoncards/Gold

&gt;I'm am not in the 'rich' section, and never have been. It was only until recently the pricing structure changed and this part of the ground became more expensive.

You are literally sat on the halfway line, the most expensive place to sit in every stadium in the country.

&gt;Why should I have to move? This is a point about the constant increases in ticket prices at City being OTT, in my opinion.

They are consistent with a Club of our size.  They offer cheaper seats elsewhere in the ground.  Your choice is to move or keep paying.

Oh wait a minute, I've just worked out what you've done.  You've bought a ticket that says PLATINUM on it which puts you on the halfway line and have complained about the pricing?

Let's just say I have experience. 

Anyway, we can't legislate for the entire country based on the unfortunate, but limited cases of people on benefits. Nothing about this proposal either rules out exemptions (which we currently have for prescriptions) or any other measures. The real point is. DNA are such an issue the *BMA* is proposing this. 

&gt;Agreed, but for minor problems it's better that they be seen early before they become more serious. For many people though even a small charge will mean they go to A&amp;E rather than their GP. It will just shift a problem onto the local hospitals.

Again I point to the fact that for minor problems triage means a massive wait in A+E's, thats also *not* how things play out in France. This just seems to be an ad hoc point to argue against it.

A preventative medicine argument doesn't really work, we are not talking about cancling peoples yearly check up, and anything so minor that its not pressing enough to sink, 10 whole quid to then have it claimed back later. Is frankly not a serious concern.

&gt;Then we need to educate people not to miss appointments or to let the practice know as soon as they cannot attend. A good advertising campaign would work wonders in nudging people on this issue. Advertising convinced people to ""clunk, click, every trip"" why not this as well.

I have seen this in every diabetic clinic I have been too since I was 12. this has been tried, it has failed.

Again, its the BMA suggesting this. This is not some political move based on the latest status reports, this has been an endemic problem for decades.

The fact is things like cost of living, (our) culture and availability of family planning mean that their birth rate will drop after each generation, just as it has for the natives and just as it has for every other immigration wave that came previously.

You're crying about something that isn't going to happen. It's a red herring. This country has had hundreds of immigration waves, none of these immigrants have become the majority. The vast majority of immigrants will integrate into society, it can take a generation or two but that's it.

Which rise? You said, verbatim; ""how about the previous three years where City instituted a price freeze?"".

Which was either very poorly written, or you were again talking shite.

Either way I certainly recall a yearly increase going back at least 5 years. So either way you're wrong.

I've read it.  You're complaining that you need points when in another part you're complaining about ""newer fans"".  As I say, I have absolutely no issue with loyalty points and don't need Platinum.  Maybe you should have put your hand in your pocket more before we were billionaires?

&gt;Unlike yourself, I don't have an 'I'm alright Jack', so while I can manage the extra cost, I don't agree with it. And I worry that it's pricing out other blues.

Then let them come on here and complain, you don't need to be vicariously complaining.  And again, the cheapest non £299 seat is £480 which is £300 cheaper than yours.  City offer numerous pricing options for people who want to go to the game.

There'd certainly be no shortage of people there to talk with you about meditation if that's what you'd like to do/learn more about.

I never said I need points. If you notice I said I can get a ticket for any game, home or away due to my points. I do so as I don't want to lose my place in the pecking order, it's the insecurity of missing out on points which encourages you to go Platinum. So again, you're talking shite, or your ability to read and write is questionable.

That cheapest £480 ticket is in the family stand. There aren't many of them, and if you don't have a kid, you can't buy one anyway.

Again, another moot point. Clearly City don't offer enough pricing options for people on a low income, given our season tickets are now among the most expensive in the league, or it certainly isn't a priority as ticket prices are going up across the board.

To say that they do is totally disingenuous.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"Oh, I think I could make an argument and I'm not a bigot. (Although, who knows?  Maybe I am.)

The N-word is just a word.  It doesn't have any magical power.  It's not a spell out of Harry Potter.  

Yes, it has a bad name because of how it's been used, but again- that's because of how it was used and not anything intrinsic to the word itself.

I think that there *is* a case for its use in art, movies, books and speech.  For instance, it was used to brilliant effect in Pulp Fiction to generate a feeling of tension and suspense.  It's similarly used in contemporary song lyrics for shock.  

There's also the argument that art is a reflection of ourselves rather than the other way round.  As long as the N-word is used in real life you should expect to see writers reflect that in their novels, screenplays and lyrics.  

Comedians might want to use the N-word, again for its shock value.  Much comedy depends on the tension generated from exploring taboos, and what could be better than the N-word which is one of the ultimate language taboos in our society?

There's also the argument that we shouldn't attempt to prettify or censor old songs, books and movies.  Much of what was acceptable 100 years ago is shocking to us now, but does that mean that we should throw out all our cultural heritage because the songs, novels and art are no longer in accord to modern sensibilities?

Finally, there's my skepticism with respect to the hypothesis that banning words (or making them taboo) has much effect on how people treat each-other.  Are we really stopping bigotry by censoring bigoted words?  Or do bigots just adjust to a different vocabulary?  After all, if you wanted to, you could victimize minorities with words from Dr Seuss or Sesame Street.  Should we ban all language?

None of this means that I think that I think bigotry is OK!  I'm very much against people who practice bigotry no matter what words they use.

-----------------

OK, I don't know how much of the above I would defend down to the last detail, but I think they're interesting arguments.  The point is that I think we ought to be able to discuss these ideas without fear of losing our jobs or being 'branded' as a bigot.

Sandy is IMO the most consistently funny and witty of all the women on the show. Her sarcasm is actually fairly masculine - a lot of the jokes she makes you'd expect from a male comedian.
Btw I love Jimmy Carr, but a lot of people here ignore his predictability as well. Also his laugh has got to be put on like a motherfucker, no one naturally laughs like he does, especially in more recent seasons.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"It's a fascinating topic!  I agree, it seems logical to make the analogy to how we decide laws in society.  Isn't democracy itself a tyranny of the plurality?  

But, I think there are differences.  Speech is not action.  Thoughts and ideas are not the same as committing acts of violence.

The danger in restricting bad speech is that no matter how hard you try, you will end up also restricting *unpopular* speech.  No matter how obvious it seems that some speech is bad, we may find out tomorrow that it's correct or merely just a minority viewpoint.

For example - homosexuality was not so long ago seen as *obscene* and an obvious affront to decent values.  It was even considered a mental illness!  It was no doubt *obvious* to many people that speech in favor of homosexuals was little different from how promoting pedophilia is considered today.  (Don't worry, I'm *not* arguing for pedophilia!)

So, even though it appears reasonable that society as a whole makes the decisions as to what is and isn't acceptable, I think that it's wrong.  I think that there's a very good intellectual argument for allowing even speech that society finds contemptible.

Also - I'd like to add that I personally think there's a difference between offensive speech and harassment.  I defend the right of people to express offensive opinions, but I haven't been persuaded that people should have the right to bully or harass others.

Of course it was never going to be a sustainable thing. You can't just remove the primary cash crop of a country and replace it with nothing...

BS. How can you stay in the EU and want to control immigration? That's contradictory. 

As the proverb goes, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

Be a member of the EU and lose control over immigration to your country, as well as losing control over the majority of the laws which you have to abide by,but have the economic benefits. Leave and have full control over immigration and all laws. Pick one. 

And If all of the major parties really want to 'limit' immigration, [then they're doing a very fucking awful job of it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26367391). They literally couldn't have done any worse in that aim. And if you look MORE THAN 50% of immigrants came from non-eu countries as well, which they could have done something about.

true,religionisanger,null,null,"So, assuming you own a fairly stable share (GSK, national grid, diageo, unilever). You'd typically get about 4-6% depending on the dividend (this can be compounded into buying more shares if you wish (this is called DRIP), obviously generating 4-6% more dividend capital the following year). If you took a third of you cash; you could probably make about £1300-£2000 a year. This disregards the shares buy/sell price (which is a little more unpredictable, but could generate you thousands - easyjet for example went up 30% last year, so along with your 2k a year, you could gain some 9k post sales, shares paying dividend typically go up in price after a year, but that may not always be the case (easyjet was a major success story for 2012 and 2013, RSA insurance on the other hand did the exact opposite).

If you're feeling more risky, invest in more volatile shares with the aim to buy and sell, rather than keep for dividend purposes. This would be more risky, but could generate more capital (volatile shares may not pay any dividend at all).

If you invest in funds, hargreaves lansdown provide some deductions for buying in; I personally find funds quite boring (expect 0.0X per day changes), but provide a safe strategy for cautious people. Hargreaves lansdown have an automatic fund selector based on risk and purpose, this is located [here](http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/master-portfolios) they also have some funds they ""prefer"" located [here](http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/wealth-150) I have £500 in marlborough multi cap, located [here](http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/fund-discounts,-prices--and--factsheets/search-results/m/marlborough-multi-cap-income-class-p-accumulation) which made 27% last year (I bought in Feb this year). Funds, unlike shares are something you look at once a year; I look at my share portfolio about 3 times a day, I find it much more interesting, I also like the dividend - even if it's a couple of hundred quid.

Someone asked about shares earlier and I posted a hell of a lot about them, it's not especially well written (I was tired), but maybe of some use to you - it basically outlines shares and some basic strategies. Financial times is quite a decent read for share advice, other than that; all websites tend to recommend the same shares.
