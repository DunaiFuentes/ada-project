I don't take exception with thinking the initial joke was funny. Christ, I said I thought it was funny. I take exception with your insistence that I thought it was funny because it was a gay joke. It wasn't a gay joke, that was the whole goddamn point I made in like 500 words in the last comment. Yet *I* need to work on my reading comprehension (and inexplicably my vocab). I thought it was on the satire end, that is it was poking fun at a status quo, not anything to do with being gay.

And one meaning of ""smug"" is to be overly proud of something. Surely you'd agree that somehow feeling the need to mention you were bi and that I didn't need to defend you would be a case of ascribing importance to yourself for no reason other than, in this case, you are bi.

But I guess you can ""win"" or whatever it is you're doing by refusing to even consider the stuff I've written. Classic internet response to continue to repeat to me that I need to work on reading comprehension and vocab rather than actually prove me wrong.

true,basketballhater,newcr-1,Besic's new Lambo,"Even though my argument is not about money, and I hate to say this, but I agree with the fact that players want to make as much money as possible.  I'll come back to my argument that the the shelf life of the average footballer is very short (I'd say ~8 years of top earning potential).  They earn what they earn in this time, and for a large number of players, this is going to encapsulate what they primarily earn for the rest of their lives.  They have family and their futures beyond football to think about.  They will have almost no income after their playing career is over so it makes sense to earn and save as much as possible so the player's future is secure.

There are players who throw all their money away on frivolous things, but I do not care about them because they will end up paying for it later.  I hate the fact that money is one of the primary reasons that a footballer, or any sports player, for that matter, chooses the club he plays for, but it makes sense when you think about it in a financial sense.",0,1402347348,null,0,false,0,ci3afsb,t3_27jrfh,t1_ci3afsb,t1_ci3a58v,null,1434165349,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

He also doesn't take part in any open public debates on independence, but *will* tell you his thoughts on the matter if you pay to see him on tour.

I also want to make it clear, I'm not a big fan of black cabs, myself, I've used: https://www.minicabster.co.uk and similar provider searches a lot for airport trips, and just checking right now, I've a lot of quotes for £1 less than uber's minimum price, and definately a lot cheaper for the uberlux.  Best of all that is risk free to me, that is to say that quote is below the minimum uber charge.

Uber are clearly profiting from not taking on the risk of delays and the like, which private hire cars are required by their licensing to do.  So again I don't think Uber have a leg to stand on, and frankly I feel sorry for those who are playing by the rules, being under cut by those who are not.

true,IxionS3,null,null,"Your original argument was that ""you would be far worse off as a company than as a individual"" unless ""you were deep into the higher-rate tax band"".

Lets look at an example of someone making £40,000 gross. That's a good income, but it's outside of higher rate tax, certainly not ""deep into it"".  According to [listentotaxman](http://www.listentotaxman.com/index.php) an employee earning a salary of £40,000 would take home £30,156.

Now look at a contractor invoicing £40,000 through a company.  They pay themselves £10,000 in salary. They pay £245 NI and no tax, taking home £9,755.  The company does not have to pay any employer's NI due to [Employment Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/employment-allowance-up-to-2000-off-your-class-1-nics).

That leaves £30,000 in the company.  Lets knock off £2000 for accountant's fees etc.(that's probably on the generous side for simple company accounts).  That leaves a gross profit of £28,000 which is subject to Corporation Tax at 20% leaving £22,400 which can be paid out as dividends with no further tax to pay.  So our imaginary contractor has taken home £32,155 - £2000 better off than the equally imaginary employee on a £40,000 salary.

So your claim that ""you would be far worse off as a company than as a individual"" unless ""you were deep into the higher-rate tax band"" is demonstrably false.  If you can legitimately operate through a company you will be better off at income levels below higher rate tax.

Your new argument, on the other hand, is much more valid.  IR35 is entirely designed to catch the sort of ""disguised employment"" the OP seemed to be contemplating, and if you're caught by it it does eliminate the tax advantage of the company (although even then it's unlikely you'd be ""substantially worse off"" - you're just not substantially better off).  And again that wasn't your original argument, and wasn't what I was responding to (although I did mention elsewhere that you typically can't just choose whether to be inside or outside PAYE).

 [**Day One (Torchwood)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day%20One%20(Torchwood\)): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;""__Day One__"" is the second episode of the [first series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Torchwood_episodes#Series_1_.282006.E2.80.932007.29) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Torchwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood)*. Written by [Chris Chibnall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Chibnall) and directed by [Brian Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kelly_(director\)), the episode was first broadcast on the digital channel [BBC Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Three) on 22 October 2006 with the series pilot, ""[Everything Changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Changes_(Torchwood\))"", and later repeated on terrestiral channel [BBC Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two) on 25 October.

&gt;The episode centres on [Gwen Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Cooper) ([Eve Myles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Myles)) working her first case with [Torchwood Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood_Institute#Torchwood_Three.2C_Cardiff) in [Cardiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff). A [purple alien gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Torchwood_monsters_and_aliens#Sex_gas) is loose in the city and takes Carys Fletcher ([Sara Lloyd Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Lloyd_Gregory)) host; the gas kills its victims by [orgasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm), leaving behind a pile of dust. Over the course of the episode, the team hunt for Carys before the gas kills her. In the end they track her down to a [fertility clinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_clinic); the gas leaves Carys to take Gwen host, but is stopped by a portable prison cell and dies out.

&gt;Originally entitled ""New Girl"", the episode was written to interpret Gwen's ""first day in hell"". On the sex gas, series creator [Russell T Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies) stated ""when we're launching a new adult science fiction drama, it's kind of inevitable you're going to do the sex monster"". The episode was filmed during a three- to four-week period in May 2006, with much of it filmed before the first episode in the same production block. ""Day One"" was originally seen by 2.3 million viewers, making it one of the highest-rated BBC Three broadcasts of all time, but was met with generally mixed reviews.

Context, context, context.

&gt; ""discreet small symbols of faith"".

Mostly fine, depending on the job. No laws against it, but it depends on the employer's rules. A massive point to make is that if you're a nurse and you want to wear a crucifix on a necklace, then you're going to be sorely disappointed due to health &amp; safety laws (that have been in place for years): the necklace is the issue, not the cross. You can wear the cross under your lapel, [unless you want to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights and lose](http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/01/european-courts-judgment-in-uk-religious-freedom-cases-a-first-read/). (aside: annoying to find how many sites/articles still get those facts wrong).

&gt; ""God bless you"" 

I haven't heard of any court/disciplinary/sacking case over this aspect. Unless she's tying it up with other issues. It would depend on whether or not the introduction of someone's personal religious faith was welcome. For example if a Christian repeatedly told a gay person ""I will *pray* for you"" in an overt ""You're evil and sinning"" way, then yes there would be an obvious problem.

&gt; you can’t offer to pray for somebody

Again, it depends who and where. Given that most of the stories/cases around this sort of thing have been in relation to health care professionals, then there is an obvious (to some) issue due to the vulnerable nature of those the prayer is offered to. A nurse offering to pray for an elderly, bed ridden patient is taking advantage of the captive/vulnerable audience, even if unintentionally.

&gt;  some of the equality laws can actually bring you to the attention of the police themselves

There are some issues over which the NSS etc. have joined with various religious groups to counter the law (as it is deemed to be an ass) i.e. Section 5. However given that Christianity etc. have exemptions from the Equality Act 2010, I'm not quite sure what she's griping about. I can't think of anything other than that she wants Christians to be able to treat gays like they were treated 'back in the day'.

It's mostly irrelevant anyway. You'll find it hard to argue that it wasn't a Christian country back when there was a law stating that everyone *had* to go to Church on a Sunday. But then, what the hell else could it be? 

It's circular reasoning, as I've said on here numerous times:

We're a Christian country because we have Bishops in the Lords because we're a Christian country our monarch is the head of the Church of England because we're a Christian country because we have collective worship of a primary Christian nature in schools because we're a Christian country we have 1/3 of state schools being run by faiths because we're a Christian country because we ceremonies of remembrance etc. lead by clergymen because we're a Christian country because... and so on and so on.

Having archaic laws and rules in place doesn't mean that it is a Christian country in the sense that the people in it are Christian, in the majority or in any meaningful sense. If we want to get pedantic in the fashion you're suggesting then let's go the whole hog and point out that ""England"", being the ""Land of the Angles"", was most certainly not initially a Christian nation due to the Angles not being Christian when they settled (I believe).

I always have to ask: How few people can be practising (or otherwise) Christians before England etc. isn't considered a Christian nation any longer?

Basically, two years ago a couple friends and I got tired of watching games just the couple of us, so we checked on Spurs website and found there was no official Cincinnati supporter's group in place.  Others were popping up all over the country so we jumped on it.  It was like a £20 or £30 yearly fee.  For that fee, you get a Spurs flag, a welcome packet with some Spurs shop specials, and usually a small gift for each member... a pin for example.  To be an official member, you have to have a client reference number.  Additional information on membership is on the website above if you're interested.  It's very informal at this point, but as we grow we hope to organize more fully.

We usually go to Rhinehaus in OTR for the games.  By ""we"" I mean there's maybe 5 to 10 Spurs supporters that meet up there on a good day.

That's weird, just the other day they were saying gay people deserve whatever they get if they make themselves visible in public, I'd just *love* to see what they have to say about this one. Oh well. 

On topic though, awful story. Really terrible if it was indeed motivated by homophobia. Couple guys in /r/gaybros saying stuff like this makes them scared to leave the house, but it's important to not let fear creep in like that. Ex bf got battered once in a horrible homophobic attack and was terrified to leave the house for ages as were some of our mates, but you can't let it affect you like that. You just can't. 

 Just gotta keep doing your thing and stay as cautious as you can, if you're gay try not to travel in groups of less than 3 at night, try to stay away from dodgy areas. Carry some sort of protection if you can, learn self defense if possible. Just don't change yourself and become invisibile if that's not who you are, never change yourself because of stuff like this. That's what they want, for you to become invisible, but you can never. You have to become more visible than ever.

""The more you try the eraser the more that I appear"" :) 

I don't worry though, these attacks are quite rare, it would be like being afraid to leave the house in case you get run over or something. Always a possibility, but not likely, not worth stressing over or letting it take over your life. I fully believe if you let terrorism like this effect how you live in any way then they just win really. Fuck that!

It makes a huge difference. The best prices on the trains are obtained by booking tickets several weeks or even a couple of months in advance. In addition, travelling outside of popular times will get you better fares, too (popular times tend to be weekday rush hours, as well as Friday evenings).

There are special ""travel as much as you want"" train passes which are only available to tourists, not UK citizens. If you're going to be doing an awful lot of train travel they might be worth investigating. You can read more here: [Britrail pass](http://www.britrail.net/passes).

&gt; I am considering using the Eurostar. Are there better ways to get to France?

The ferries from Dover can often be cheaper, especially for a foot passenger, but they take a little longer and of course you have to get yourself to Dover, and then arrange onwards travel from Calais. Low-cost airlines such as Easyjet also fly to France from many UK airports, depending on where and when you want to travel they might be cheaper than, and almost as convenient as, Eurostar.",0,1402379670,null,0,1402379870,0,ci3oa7i,t3_27qz6y,t1_ci3oa7i,t3_27qz6y,null,1434172006,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

1) Any increase in price when you come to sell (if an investment property) may mean you have to pay capital gains tax.

2) Income from rent can be taxed (I believe it's ""profit"" which will be the rent - (house upkeep + mortgage interest))

3) It's expensive and time consuming, just buying. I've not sold a house buy buying one can take a few months and easily cost a few thousand.

&gt; Deposit on a Southern house now whilst prices are cheap and I have the money?

Are they cheap? They've just jumped up in price, yes, but does that mean they're cheap as they're shooting up or overpriced?

&gt; Is having one house that I own better than having multiple properties with multiple mortgages?

In terms of tax, yes. Growth in just your own home is not taxed as I understand it (warning, I'm a dude on the internet, not a financial advisor with guarantees).  Buy to let mortgages also typically require higher deposits and have higher interest rates (significantly higher rate of people defaulting on mortgages when they own multiple for investment purposes).

&gt; Is renting a premises throwing money away?

No. You're always going to be paying for a roof, either with rent (which comes with a bunch of guarantees and protections, as well as a lot of freedom) or with mortgage interest, upkeep and fees. 

If you're planning to be in the North for a year, the South for a few years then back North to settle I'd suggest waiting until you're back up North and planning to stay, and split the money between some safer places (cash isa) and some things that are more likely to give good growth (cheap index funds in a S&amp;S ISA).

How is this ever going to happen when white people make it perfectly clear they don't want to intergrate either?

I've said it before and I'll say it again, nobody likes standing out in a crowd. 

The reasons muslims don't want to ""intergrate"" is the same reasons white people want to clamp down on immigration - because they want to be around their own kind. 

People don't like standing out in a crowd, being the ""other"" and making themselves vulnerable to be targetted for being different. It's the whole reason ""White Flight"" exists, it's the whole reason British people don't like immigration, it's the whole reason Gay Villages are cultivated in cities, and it's the whole reason immigrant ""ghettos"" are cultivated in cities too.

All of these things are rooted in the same desre - the desire to fit in, to be ""normal"", to be a part of a community of people like yourself. 

So first we have to acknowledge that this is a universal feeling, not just a reluctance to intergrate by immigrants; the muslims, the poles, the gays, the ""natives"", they all want to be surrounded by their own kind to feel safe. 

If you judge an immigrant for wanting to be around other immigrants, you'll have to extend that same judgement to natives for wanting to be around other natives. 

How can intergration ever happen if white people only want to be around white people as much as immigrants only want to be around other immigrants?

I believe multi-culturalism *does* work. I believe you can have the gay ghettos, the immigrant ghettos, and the native ghettos and live alongside peacefully. That's multi-culturalism to me. 

Intergration can't happen, because as much as the ""natives"" like to scream and shout about how much they want it, they don't, otherwise they wouldn't be so opposed to immigration in the first place. 

They say it themselves - they don't like going outside and seeing a bunch of muslims and shops with arabic writing. So who are they trying to kid when they say they want muslims to intergrate?",0,1402385253,null,0,false,0,ci3poth,t3_27oj5x,t1_ci3poth,t1_ci38jqo,null,1434172670,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

On the religion/politics point, don't get me wrong I'm not suggesting we're a country run by religion by any means, but however based in history those links are, they're still there. The christian leaders get automatic entry into out political system, the head of state is the head of the religion, and all that other stuff.

History doesn't matter, just the here and now, and here and now all of the above are true. Religious interference is at a minimum, but to deny that christianity is woven into large parts of our society is blindness or stupidity.

From the article. How long ago was it that Gove was being lambasted here for not listening to teachers and head teachers and pursuing his own agenda.

Now here he is, having made a decision after listening to head teachers and again is being lambasted.

When will people admit that as far as they're concerned, he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't?

BTW, before this gets downvoted to oblivion by the Graudian crew, I like a lot of what he's trying to achieve, although I disagree with him removing the vocational aspect of teaching as not all kids are academic.

I'm a small town boy so there weren't really the 'blood and thunder' bands that Belfast seems to have in abundance. Not sure I would enjoy that quite so much.

Can't say I've ever been involved in a contentious march but that's not really surprising. 12th was always great fun, moreso outside Belfast as it's a bit more of a family affair and not a 'statement'. 13th in scarva is a much nicer day though and if anyone was curious about such things I'd suggest they go there rather than a 12th parade.

Both of those fund types are a bit less passive than just having one total world index, or a UK index plus an ex-UK index, because they have specific amounts dedictated to each regional index. 

&gt;I'm wondering whether it would be sensible to begin exposing myself myself to global, non-UK funds as part of a long-term retirement investment.

You seem to have a massive focus on UK and small companies in particular. You can see for yourself on the charts what UK smaller cos have put on in recent years. These massive rises are unsustainable so you yes you need to think globally. For the next x year plus y years of retirement you will be buying TVs made in Asia and cars or washing machines made in Europe and software/ internet products and a whole load of other stuff made in the US (or at least, where the intellectual property is owned by the US - it's the largest developed economy on the planet). And the prices will be driven by global cost base and global currencies.  

FTSE 100 doesn't have an equivalent of facebook or google or microsoft or IBM or sony or samsung or VW or BMW or Ford. And neither does UK microcap. So if you are going to need to buy these products in the future it kind of makes sense to either invest in those companies or at least have some assets denominated in USD and Euro and Korean Won and Chinese RMB or whatever. To presume that UK will perform the best of everything on the planet over a 40 year view just because it has had a good few years, is pretty arrogant.

I use the Vanguard LS100 fund among a load of other picks within my ISA and SIPP. The LS80 also has some bond exposure but I have piced my own strategic bond funds as well as individual holdings that I like for my fixed interest component. 

I'm not sure why you would only be tempted by one of the components of LS100. If you need global largecap exposure, without wanting 50%+ of it in the US, it is a reasonable mix. The only component I'm less pleased with is the emerging markets index because I generally feel that EM, like smallcaps, are places where there is a lot of crap in the index and an active manager can do better because the market is less efficient. However, that's only a bit less than 10% of all the equities in the fund, and given EM has come off its highs somewhat in the last few years, I don't mind having a bit via the LS and increase my exposure with my own choices.",0,1402388809,null,0,1402389001,0,ci3qdsr,t3_27mhh9,t1_ci3qdsr,t1_ci2t6ei,null,1434172994,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

Now, how many people are falsely convicted of these crimes? 

A recent statistical study in the US claims around 4% of inmates on death row are not guilty of the crimes they were convicted for. Innocent men have been put to death in the US. This is a fact.

How many innocent people do you think are worth killing to ensure the guilty ones are also killed.

But even besides that argument we have to think about the sort of society we want to be. Do we want to be the sort of people who execute other people? What purpose does the death penalty serve?

true,Jlowry13,,Newry. 384 1st pref votes. Baird's sausage rolls,"The Orange to me offers different things all of which are important to me, but not always equally so. I had a brilliant answer for this written down after a workshop but have forgotten where I left it so bare with me.

Primarily the Orange is a religious organisation, it seeks to promote the protestant faith, (a charge all Christians are given, but not one all accomplish adequately) and is open to anyone who comes to a reformed faith in Christ, no matter where they came from. However we do have regular church services, which give those who attended the opportunity to hear and see different styles of worship and preaching, as our members come from many different churches and denominations. That of course is only the public demonstration of our faith, privately in meetings there is points of prayer and the opportunity to discuss the Bible with other Christians who may not be part of your congregation.

There is also a great sense of community, people from the local area and further coming together. I've made friends I likely wouldn't have meet otherwise if not for the Orange, being that we don't attend the same church, or school or job. There is a uniting factor there and I genuinely care about where I'm from and the people here, why shouldn't I be involved with them. We also have barbeques and other forms of entertainment throughout the year, which are seldom private, were there is always the opportunity for fellowship and to have a good nights crack. 

Politically the Orange isn't one large force, its a collection of individuals, none more important than the other, with their own ideas. While primarily unionists there are opportunities to talk and debate within a safe space, whether that is a genuine meeting of the minds or slagging of your mates for joining the DUP. But there is still a reminder there that you are brothers and hopefully that prevents us from having major falling outs. However the order is Royalist, believing that a Protestant Monarch being important in ensuring our rights are maintained, exactly how this thought prevailed following the influx of Presbyterians after 1798 I don't know, but it is no doubt in reference to King William, the 1689 Bill of Rights, and the bloody history of Catholic Monarchs attacking Protestants, (oddly King James II never attacked Protestants until after he was ousted, but was building up to it). 

For many it is a family tradition, and whilst it was certainly the influence and guidance of my father that prompted me to join its not by any family connection that I stay, my maternal grandfather never being a member and my maternal grandfather being a member of a different lodge and subsequently leaving (for reasons I've yet to ask). My paternal grandmother was a member of the women's Orange and was quite prominent within her district. 
I am however a member of the RBP and my own preceptory was the traditional preceptory of my maternal side, despite missing a few generations it does feel nice being part of a longer family line within the organisation. 

This is all well and good but: religion, fellowship and community mean little if you are by yourself, nor do our rights mean anything if we do not exercise then, so by parading we may be celebrating our rights and expressing our religious identity, we may be commemorating our friends, celebrating victories that secured those rights, and not to mention having a good time whilst doing so.",0,1402390178,null,0,false,0,ci3qmfi,t3_27qxj2,t1_ci3qmfi,t3_27qxj2,null,1434173109,10,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,10

true,BaBaFiCo,derbyshire,S. Derbyshire,"The way it currently works isn't right. But the system is pretty broken. 

On the one hand, OFSTED keep moving the goalposts at the behest of the government. Some years they want lessons to be all-singing all-dancing events. The current trend is that lessons need to have students independently learning and making progress. This means that every inspection or so schools have to change how they teach to fit the criteria. 

Secondly, the criteria is quite high. OFSTED expect quite a lot from a school, with each lesson requiring lots more paperwork etc than would be needed in a normal lesson. Teachers stay after school till about 8pm on the night before inspection printing various class lists, putting together data analysis sheets and constructing seating charts that are prioritise based upon whatever data is flavour of the month. This, plus the panic that their lessons aren't engaging enough, means planning takes over their lives for the 48 hours 

Thirdly, it's too stressful for teachers. Inspections are not the independent events portrayed. Its no coincidence that Derbyshire, with the lowest number of academies, has seen a significant increase in inspections with schools being hit left right and centre. It seems they have an agenda and during inspections I've been part of it often feels the inspectors have a judgement in mind already and just want to find the evidence to support that.

I suspect these schools, whilst not wanting to generalise, can be found areas where middle-class parents dominate. Where students have the kind of home cultures that foster a good learning environment and encourage hard work. Whereas schools in areas where parents don't appreciate education or respect schools it is much harder to get the students to make the progress they need. 

Unfortunately OFSTED, like Gove's new GCSEs, doesn't respect this kind of diversity. Schools aren't judged by their performance in context, but by a single set of criteria that all must meet. A good idea in theory, since education must be available and good for all, but in practice does not allow for the varying circumstances children come from.

it even says it right in the article

&gt; The fact that the maximum fine at level 4 for speeding on a motorway is being increased to £10,000 does not mean that is the sum an offender will have to pay - even if their speeding is at the most serious end of the scale.

&gt;Whilst the amount of a fine must reflect the seriousness of the offence, the court must also take into account the financial circumstances of the offender - in other words, their ability to pay.

&gt;This applies whether it has the effect of increasing or reducing the fine. Normally a fine should be of an amount that is capable of being paid within 12 months.

&gt;The aim is for the fine to have an equal impact on offenders with different financial circumstances.

&gt;It should be a hardship but should not force the offender below a reasonable ""subsistence"" level.

Plus I liked how little we gave a fuck about our appearance and laid back we were compared to all the other bands, many of which had their heads up their own arses.

However after the flag came down 2 years ago I got into bitter arguments with friends when they kept spewing retarded or bigoted shite on Facebook and I hated the Orange Order, so I walked away from both the band to avoid being a hypocrite and distanced myself from most of my friends in Fermanagh. It was a ""culture"" that I wanted no part in (frankly I never truly fitted in with the folk I grew up, most of my friends came from a small area in south Fermanagh, and for the most part all they cared about was marching and nothing else - very little interests outside of that.

For a nice day out, Ryton Gardens is a good afternoon out, that apparently does great food (not tried it yet but heard some great reviews). There are a variety of theatres dotted about Coventry, The Belgrade normally has a decent selection and offer free tickets for certain shows if you are under 25. Otherwise The Criterion in Earlsdon does a show a month that are normally very good. Warwick Arts Centre also has a good selection of theatre and music. 

If you have a car, the Showcase cinema outside of town is very reasonably priced and offers a bargain Tuesday. They also have live comedy acts one night of the week. 

Chi Bar in the town centre is a tiny Japanese fast food eatery - very popular, very good and not very expenisve. Otherwise Millsy's in Earlsdon does a reasonable pub grub style selection, and is very busy and lively of a weekend. They also offer 2 for 1 cocktails on a Thursday. The Greyhound at Longford is a really lovely pub right by the canal. It's a great place to people watch. Warwick University also has some nice places to eat and drink, but are of course, only open term time. 

In terms of bars, I see Inspire has already been mentioned. I personally like Drapers Bar (was Browns) which do a large selection of beers. Whitefriars is also a favourite. 

But most of, have fun in your new house. Coventry isn't exactly fashionable but it is small enough to get almost anywhere is a taxi for less than £15, has an okay town centre, and a small selection of things to do.

You also shouldn't have to call *anyone* up to remove these filters, on either your phone or your broadband connection.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;ut in Bulgaria they don't have minimum standards and actually use witchcraft to heal people? You are ridiculous.

The standard they expect (and get) is A LOT lower.

You yourself have just admitted that using them is an example of using the poorest.  They're poor.  They have lower standards.   

&gt;I haven't said that. I'm only pointing to the fact UK citizens are now treated on equal terms as EU citizens in relation to employment, without the need to fulfil extra criteria, visas, permits, sponsorship... or other time consuming crap.

But you did.  It was in connection to people with poorer qualifications, education and standards...and you arguing they'd still get work.  We were talking about people trained in the UK,and from the UK. 

This is what I mean by you having a schizophrenic level of  conversation.

&gt;&gt;This is incomprehensible.

&gt;What is? That UK helps both in the EU (by currently giving more than receiving due to being richer, yet having all other EU positives)? Or that the UK also helps non-EU countries using that fund, which consists of our taxes, yet having much less control and no positives as compared with the EU.

Your English.  Your English was incomprehensible.  Usually it's quite good in this sense, but that paragraph was incomprehensible.

&gt;The point was that UK already helps others... but of course can change it as it is not obliged to be in the EU, nor to send any financial aid to non-EU countries.

So your point is that you have no point.  This whole avenue about the UK's overseas commitment has come from you saying from criticising me for putting the NHS and UK first.   You seem to have forgotten that now and are off on another segue...

&gt;Jesus, mate. You are terribly hard to discuss stuff with. I'm NOT saying that EU doctors will NOT be coming to the UK to work, in line 100% less of them. I'm saying that if visa requirements were to be put up, there would CERTAINLY be a decrease in their numbers. A

I must be hard for you to discuss stuff with, because your thought process is often dislocated.  You seem to forget what you've said, and drift in and out.

When you claim that putting visa requirements up would certainly decrease the numbers it's just pure speculation on your part.  They can extend as many visas as they want, and where they already extend visas to countries outside the EU then they already recruit MORE doctors on visas than they do through the EU.

&gt;Yes, look above. I'm not saying 100% less but obviously some figure less, just like people would travel less to places where they know it's hard to get a visa to, as compared to other place where they don't have a visa (unless of course something much different is offered in that place).

Based on what?  You say 'obviously less' without having any understanding.  There's absolutely no reason why under controlled immigration the NHS could intentionally DOUBLE the numbers it recruits from the EU.  It could acquire its own work visas, set up several work fayres across Europe and launch an active recruitment campaign to double the numbers, much like it recruits in India.  Where they already take care of the visa issue.

You're basing everything you've said (and you started by saying they would still be able to recruit all the existing NHS doctors from the EU as 'bullshit') on your own assumption and speculation.  

The UK could easily extend however many visas it wants and even double NHS recruitment from the EU, whilst being outside the EU.

&gt;But you forgot UK is in the EU partially because of that, to have those altruistic gestures and help those poorer EU countries. It's obviously not one sided though but that's how it currently works, otherwise UK would object from the very beginning to the financial system of the EU as in richer countries pay more than poorer ones!

I forgot, did I?  I forgot that we joined the EU to be altruistic in a wholly inefficient way - or maybe I didn't forget and you're telling me what I feel.

You can help someone for mutual gain through trade.  If someone gains more and the deal is less favourable for some then compensation, or a form of rebate can negotiated.   That is what the UK joined.  A common market with a large UK rebate.

Then it turned into a single market, and the rebate became winnowed.

Please don't try and tell me why the UK joined what and why, and as somebody from the UK what I personally support and how.  Certainly not when you've already tried criticising me for putting the NHS and people of the UK first.

&gt;Yet, it doesn't happen and NHS is having staff shortages.

Yet in trying to address those issues we're recruiting far more on visas.  So having a visa system needn't be some sort of bottleneck.

&gt;Oh, one more thing. There was an article few weeks ago about number of complaints in relation to UK and foreign doctors. I don't remember if they said non-EU doctors or immigrant doctors in general. Their service was of lower standards than British doctors...... so maybe that whole idea ""of the best"" doesn't really work and rather than rely on foreign staff, UK should do something about having more local people to work in NHS?

Yes.  We should be focussing more on using UK people and trying to keep our own higher standards high.   I just argued that we shouldn't be lowering the UK standards by having an open door policy, but if standards are dropping because there of the sheer numbers we need, and the choice is weak, then there is something we can be doing.

It's another reason for dropping out of the EU.  Heads of departments within the NHS have already described the EU as breaking the NHS with its Working Hour Directives.  That it would have taken decades to implement properly and instead has created shortages and lowered training.

All you've done is quote the ""headline"" policies, the policies which people cling to because they're too lazy to learn about the rest of the policies and their effect.

UKIP is poison for this nation and here's why:

**Economy and Taxation**

1: ""UKIP proposes cuts in corporation taxes and the abolition of inheritance taxes."" 

Where do you think the shortfall in taxes is going to come from? It's going to put much more a strain on working people who earn ANYTHING over minimum wage. They're also talking about a flat tax rate - £5000 a year is much more valuable to someone earning £15000 over someone earning £80,000. This is a stupid policy designed simply to make the rich richer and the poorer even more destitute.

2: ""The abolition of national insurance is advocated by UKIP, which it says will simplify the tax system.""

Really? No national insurance? How are we going to pay for the NHS and benefits system? Both points of contention but again, someone earning £80,000 probably isn't going to have an issue walking into another job, someone on £15,000 is likely much more expendable.

3: ""UKIP proposes ""tens of billions"" of cuts to taxation, along with a further £77bn of cuts to the public sector in order to reduce the deficit.""

Again where is this money going to be taken from? Probably us and the likes of education, science funding, museums and libraries, fire service and a whole host of other ""non essential"" public services. 

The economic plans outlined by UKIP have been called into question by The Times, who have highlighted a “£120 billion black hole” in their spending plans.

**Health**

1: ""According to the party website, UKIP proposes directing the majority of health care spending to elected County Health Boards, making spending decisions directly accountable to the public locally""

Oh really? Like the NHS supply and funding is already fucked up so the idea is to turn them in to small businesses raising the cost supplies because no one can buy in bulk anymore. Hmm, sounds like only the board members of medical supply companies would benefit. I wonder who's running as UKIP MP's in some districts...

2: ""In addition, UKIP proposes introducing a voucher system that will enable people to receive treatment outside of the NHS, replace non-clinical managers with matrons to run NHS hospitals and introduce free dental and eye checks.""

Simply not going to happen, their tax policies are too anti NHS and this is an appeasement that simply won't materialise but let's people tell their pals ""UKIP want to make everything in NHS free, isn't that cool, you should vote for them!"" These types of policies happen from every party but this is possibly the most blatant.

**EU**

1: ""UKIP advocates leaving the European Union, resulting in stopping payments to the EU and withdrawal from EU treaties, while maintaining trading ties with other European countries.""

I don't think you realise how serious an issue this is. If we leave the EU and have them stop dictating policy some quite nasty proposals would now be law. Part of the reason the EU exists is to prevent the rise of dictators. 

On top of that I don't see any issue ""paying in to the EU"". It should be noted that the figures often quoted include the value of *labour*. You know, british people who work in the EU under other governments and get paid from their economy. Engineers, tradesmen, ship workers, oil workers and a whole bunch of other professions.

Plus it should be no question anyway because the money *helps to make other human beings life better*. If these countries don't come up how will they pay us back? Do you really want to abondon billions upon billions of pounds, put pressure on a whole host of other **people** and make the world a worse place?

On top of that, what if I wanted to move to france or spain? I can go there, get a mortgage and a job and move with no restrictions. UKIP supporters often claim that migrants are taking their jobs. Think about the types of jobs these migrants take - most british people, especially working class people simply wouldn't touch them and don't. If you've been a plumber for 20 years and work dries up you're not going to become a cleaner. This is mentality that exists, especially where I live.

On that note, a lot of the eastern Europeans I've spoken to are generally highly qualified, for example I know of 3 qualified accountants who accepted jobs over here but we were turned away at the last second because their qualification aren't recognised in the UK. They spent all their money coming over on the promise of a job to have it taken away. So they have to take a job earning £3 an hour working shit conditions simply because they've been fucked over and you want to *punish* them for it. 

Most people who come over do so with the best intentions and a job lined up, some do come over cause we're seen as a ""soft touch"" but that's a very slim minority of an already pretty low number already. It's the out of EU immigrants that are causing many of the issues UKIP claim are there.

**EU Court Human Rights Act**

1: ""UKIP wants to repeal the Human Rights Act, and remove Britain from both the European Convention on Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights to ""enable us to deport foreign criminal and terrorist suspects where desirable"" while still ""allow[ing] genuine asylum applications in accordance with our international obligations"".""

For real. For really real. You want to repeal the **HUMAN RIGHTS ACT**. Are you seriously advocting that we lose our **BASIC** human rights? This is so fucking insane and Farage's megalomania is quite clear here. Think about that. We pull out of the eu, we repeal human rights and you think everything is going to be fine? Think we live in a facist police state now - how much worse will it be when the police can break into your home and shoot you dead without any worry of repercussions. Have you heard of death camps? Cause that's it'll end up and evidence of this type of practice can be seen in Africa. Isolate, strip rights, dominate and cleanse. Nazi germany, russia, italy so on and so forth. This is such a dangerous thing that you must educate yourself and fellow supporters on.  

**Defence**

That leads me on nicely to this

1: ""In its 2010 manifesto UKIP proposed a 40 percent increase in defence spending""

What exactly do we need a larger military for? Invasions, ""keeping the peace"" and I'm sure they'd never be deployed on UK soil... /s

**Climate Change**

1: ""UKIP are sceptical of man-made climate change and oppose the creation of wind farms and investment in other renewable energy sources""

So they're morons who won't invest in Britains future non reliance on foreign fuel. Alright then because I love paying super high bills anyway. Regardless of ""climate change"" alternative energy is extremely important for the UK because we simply don't have the fuel reserves. 

**Same Sex Marriage**

UKIP oppose it. Why? Who gives anyone the right to make someone else's life miserable simply because they don't like the idea. If someone told me I couldn't spend the rest of my life with the woman I love because they find it distastful I would be livid. 

People have the right to love who they love and they should be able to enjoy all the benefits marriage brings without persecution because they love their own gender rather than the opposite. 

**Immigration** 

Don't even get me started. It's all smoke and mirrors because the fact of the matter is most immigrants are highly skilled and fill essential job roles where theirs currently a defecit. In fact that's one of the factors that must be fulfilled before someone is allowed to enter the country outside of the EU for work. 

None of UKIPs policies will have any effect on what people want to fight *illegal immigration*. People will still sneak in and live under the radar. Kicking out those who fill a very specific need in the country will only serve to it's detriment. 


So, Why exactly are you going to vote for UKIP? What possible reason could there be for someone who's taken the time to educate themselves about major party policies. And that's the crux of the issue, they know that people who have vested selfish business interests will vote for them and people who can't be bothered to read a few lines will cling to the headlines.

Have you ever left the UK?

We are a country that the majority of the world absolutely aspires to be like. While we bitch and moan about everything as if the sky is falling, the rest of the world is most certainly not made up from tolerant, modern societies. In most of the world, women are treated like possessions, traded, bought and sold, forced to marry and have no control over their own choices. In most of the world gay people are widely hated or just outlawed altogether.

Religious tolerance and opposition to gender segregation most certainly ARE British values. That's not to say that no other countries can also share them, but we are definitely one of the leaders in both of those regards.

Try living abroad. You'll see that the UK is really a very, very good place to live. People are generally polite, respectful and treat each other with decency. Despite the chavs, racist old people and arsehole politicians, the UK is paradise compared to most of the rest of the world.

She could have defended her decisions to see her granddaughter and potentially avoided jail time, if she had bothered turning up to court.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;They're poor. They have lower standards.

Doesn't have to be poorer standard in everything, especially in education's level. On the contrary, for example Poland was ahead of the UK in some last year's education comparison and as I have personally experienced both education systems (although on different levels) it really is true (I also know from many stories that kids going to school here and migrating back to Poland often have to go one or even two classes back, even though in UK teaching starts quicker).

&gt;But you did. It was in connection to people with poorer qualifications, education and standards...and you arguing they'd still get work. We were talking about people trained in the UK,and from the UK.

Again, I didn't say that (quote me!). I only said and meant that those people are to be treated at the same level in connection with offering employment.

&gt;Your English. Your English was incomprehensible.

Well, let me quote you and YOUR English (and I'm a Johny Foreigner): * The very system that you've moved countries to be employed by you now criticise*

&gt;So your point is that you have no point

My point is you can't see any point which doesn't suit you and your anti-EU agenda. Just like idiot Farage quoting Think Tank paper because it was anti-immigrant and ignoring university paper, because it was pro-immigration.

&gt;When you claim that putting visa requirements up would certainly decrease the numbers it's just pure speculation on your part. They can extend as many visas as they want, and where they already extend visas to countries outside the EU then they already recruit MORE doctors on visas than they do through the EU.

I can say exactly the same ""SPECULATION"" about what you just have said on increasing visas and getting more no-EU doctors/staff as AGAIN, if we have shortages now, something isn't that easy as you describe it as.

&gt;There's absolutely no reason why under controlled immigration the NHS could intentionally DOUBLE the numbers it recruits from the EU

Well, you know start changing by adding new information. Obviously if NHS heavily invested in EU recruitment, then it could even increase. We were discussing current scenario, not potential what NHS ""could do""... not saying about how much it WOULD COST as it's certainly not free, right?

&gt;Please don't try and tell me why the UK joined what and why, and as somebody from the UK what I personally support and how.

What? You know EXACTLY why UK joined the EU? And the UK didn't know about it's expansion and what that would mean? If UK was really that selfish, they would have blocked EU expansion as it was obvious they would pay more towards poorer countries. As in relation to YOUR personal beliefs, you can believe and support whoever and whatever.

&gt;Yet in trying to address those issues we're recruiting far more on visas. So having a visa system needn't be some sort of bottleneck.

The point stands, NHS currently has shortages and probably have had for a number of years already.

&gt;Heads of departments within the NHS have already described the EU as breaking the NHS with its Working Hour Directives.

Oh, so you prefer being seen by a doctor who has worked REALLY LONG hours? Right? I also don't think that the EU suddenly has said ""From tomorrow, you all work less because we just figured out it would be good"".

&gt;I just argued that we shouldn't be lowering the UK standards by having an open door policy

And I don't see how that would happen, since you have said it yourself, that doctors with poor university would struggle to get into employment. How is EU open borders reducing standards then? After all the whole open doors allows for easier employment of EU nationals in NHS and that is required due to NHS staff shortages. Unless of course you use the argument that NHS wouldn't have shortages if immigrants from the EU weren't coming here.... but that's a completely different topic so let's not start it.",0,1402400917,null,0,false,0,ci3sj0h,t3_27m2id,t1_ci3sj0h,t1_ci3s1nq,null,1434174006,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,genetic_ape,null,null,"I agree with skeletonclock 100%. First year, definitely live in halls. You'll meet people in halls who you walk to lectures with, sit with, eat with and drink with. Basically halls makes a huge difference in your ability to make friends. 

Also, this may be your first time away from home for any extended period. Halls makes this transition easier, as you're not cooking, doing dishes, cleaning a whole house, organising payment of bills; all while trying to study and socialise. Rooms are cleaned and meals are prepared for you. All you have to do is clean yourself and your clothes. 

Also, the friends you meet in 1st year halls will be friends you live with in second, third years etc. Go into a house first year and you risk being a bit of a drifter/couch surfer the following years, living with complete strangers. 

In terms of money:

Halls: around £5000 for a standard room. All bills, utilities and food included.

My expenses for house from 2nd year in 2011:

Rent: £60 (which is very cheap) x approx 50 weeks = £3000

Food: £30 x approx 50 weeks = £1500

Bills split by 4 people (internet, gas, elec, water etc) = £70 per person per month. This is £840 per year.

Already this is £5340. Higher than hall costs, with none of the benefits. This figure could be alot higher if you're spending more than £60 per week on your rent. Good advice, everything costs more than you think it will. We haven't even factored in any bus tickets or social spending.

After first year, by all means get a house with some good friends. Its very freeing after a year in halls. But halls are perfect for what they are for: settling you in to a new city where you will be without the comforts of your family and old friends. And renting a house is in no way cheaper than halls once you factor in all the extras you'll be spending on.

Yes, his policy to ensure tolerance and equality is correct. However, he doesn't need to frame it as ""British values"". He can be much bolder in saying we are ensuring these because it is quite simply a core human right.

He's framing all this in a shroud of patriotism.

I think the point is that these things:

&gt;flags and kerb-stones

are an indicator that these things:

&gt;people who use such symbols to reinforce bigoted views

exist, otherwise the flags and kerbstones and all the rest wouldn't exist like they do. Sure, if there'd never been any Troubles different parts of the city would probably still look pretty festive at times as various communities celebrated their various (colour-coded) events/days/ceremonies, but it seems highly unlikely they'd be used to mark territory in such an obvious way, or that a year after the Union Flag gets reduced flying at City Hall, the flags that get put up in other areas of the city (and in mixed areas) are suddenly bigger, or that the scale of it would be anything like it currently is. 

&gt;Banning those symbols

The person you're replying to wasn't (at all) suggesting flags be banned, nor was the article OP linked to. Not even the SF politicians quoted in the article were suggesting any kind of ban. 

&gt;are we really saying that it is acceptable for people to be 'intimidated' by a flag

'faggot' is just a word, but if a group of large, threatening-looking blokes were saying it to you as you walked past them on your way home on a saturday night, you'd be silly not to be intimidated. Words and flags are just symbols that represent something else, and they're heavily dependant on context. Maybe I'm just referring to that bunch of firewood, or maybe I'm just putting up a small Union Jack in my window to show a bit of patriotism on the Queen's birthday, but if I'm yelling it at an effeminate man walking home alone or putting up huge flags in mixed areas where I *know* people will take it as a sign that my community and my community's paramilitaries are in control, it's a completely different situation.

true,111111222222,null,null,"&gt;I read your view on Defense, talk about ignorance. One of the largest economies on the world with established trade routes all over the world and a strong political influence, and this joker can't figure out why a large defense budget is needed. And what happens when another inevitable war kicks off that the UK has literally no choice, but to enter? Then what? We lose everything, because people like you couldn't figure out the need for a large military.

I thought UKIP was against Britain meddling in foreign affairs? We still have the best armed forces in the world and can raise a large, advanced army *should the need arise*. Spending £56 billion for something ""Just in case"" is a pretty illogical line of thought and a poor argument for it's advocacy. To add to that, it's my argument you should be attacking not me personally. 

&gt; Also, the humans rights act does not literally give you human rights.

Actually it kinda does. Since joining the EU Britain doesn't maintain a human rights act. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Act_1998

An excerpt of this: ""Its aim is to ""give further effect"" in UK law to the rights contained in the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, but more commonly known as the European Convention on Human Rights. The Act makes available in UK courts a remedy for breach of a Convention right, without the need to go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.""

What this means is if the EU human rights act is repealed the one in force in Britain will become invalid and unlawful. It's all well and good saying it would be adapted but personally I don't feel that'd happen due to the rest of policies. 

Yeah some people abuse it, but **ALL** of us are protected by it.

&gt; If not having a big army is no issue because your view seems to be what are the chanced of another war happening, then what are the chances of dictators popping up in the EU? 

This is a circular argument that doesn't really go anywhere or affect my argument. We currently do not need a large military because the EU operates on the basis that if there was a another hitler rising in say greece and they were ramping up their military the threat of 10 armies a third of the size of theirs is still much more significant threat. 

I don't personally feel defense spending should be cut tbh, but I don't think it should be raised significantly. But then again, I can't pick and choose policies and this particular one isn't a massive issue for me or the rest of the civilian public. 

&gt; Britain should be a self-sufficient country, not part of the EU. We're slowly, but surely loosing out culture and history and becoming some mediocre country.

And you want to do that by relying on foreign fuel, foreign trade agreements and taking much more money out of your own pocket. Seems like a terrible idea to me. Unless we get back to colonialism and expanding the Empire we simply will not be self suffcient but the world tends to get a bit angry at countries who subjugate others by force...

&gt; A lot of your views against UKIP are basted of assumption or unclear information.

Have you ever heard of ""the devil is in the details"" it's not just what's in the manfasto its self that's scary, it's what's *not* and that gives them a lot of freedom to do what the fuck they want. Have a look at the Nazi part manfesto from the 1920's. It looks extremely familiar.

&gt; A lot of their policies they've not commented on
Why haven't they? Do they really expect someone who utilises critical thinking to think they have the best intentions at heart or would it be more likely to assume that they're hiding them with intention? I don't trust any poltician and you shouldn't either.

A simple look at wikipedia outlines a lot of their policies, their MP's (and their business interests), party dynamics and a whole host of other things. Following the sources provides evidence of these policies which I suggest you check. 

&gt; It's people like you slowly killing our country and culture.
Please explain how people like me are killing the country and how we're ditching our culture? Cause I'd really like to know how I've personally country. I don't think I've asked anyone to demolish castles, not sell beatles records, not to reproduce shakespeare. 

I mean our definitions of culture must differ because I don't feel that we've lost any culture. What I think you're getting at is psuedo racism where you're scared of foreigners despite us out numbering them 1000's to one. 

Again some people are trying to destroy our culture but that's why MI5, the police and border force exist. 

The interesting thing is though how you've not commented on ANYTHING that would DIRECTLY affect you day to day: The economy, Tax, Energy, The NHS.

Canary Wharf was the first, of course: almost all recent redevelopment (that is not the right term) on the South Bank has followed.  And now the Olympic Park.  There must be many other places as yet undiscovered by our agents: perhaps most of London now.

At first they seem to be public spaces, but of course they are not: not public, and – perhaps – *not spaces*.  The architecture is somehow wrong: the angles subtly non-euclidean.  And the people, superficially ordinary but somehow blank: like poor copies of humans. The ever-present ""security"" with their sunglasses and uniforms: almost policemen but not quite.  It is rather as if some intelligence, vast, remote and *other*, was making a copy of a city without really understanding what a city was.

I was nearly trapped by a nasty little thing in something like a golf cart.  It was quite plausible at first until you realised that *there were no eyes behind the sunglasses*, and of course there were no legs: it simply merged seamlessly into the ""cart"" it rode on.  I realised just in time that it was herding me towards the ""stadium"" – what fate awaited me there I hesitate to think.  Fortunately it wasn't very clever and I managed to force it into the river.  The hissing and bubbling was extraordinary; and the smell, like burning grease and old cat litter, was indescribable: only my years of training and a light bike allowed me to escape the column of noxious gas rising from its dissolution.

So no, I am rather afraid you did not fall off your bike: *I think they caught you*.  You may not have checked your watch (we encourage everyone to do this, of course, after these events) but if you did you will find at least an hour unaccounted for, and possibly more – sometimes days.

You just argued we should lower our own standards to further the rest of the world.  Sorry.  No.

&gt;Again, I didn't say that (quote me!)

YOU:   

       ""Doctors from better unis may have priority, but 
        nobody will say ""No applications are allowed from 
        doctors who finished x university"".

You were specifically talking about levels of qualifications, and that's exactly what employers will do - especially when the analogy is applied in practicality.  

&gt;Well, let me quote you and YOUR English (and I'm a Johny Foreigner): * The very system that you've moved countries to be employed by you now criticise*

Errr...that makes sense.  Arguably it needs one a comma, but not necessarily so.

The you have moved countries to be employed by a system.  You now criticise that very same system.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;""The very system that you've moved countries to be employed by you now criticise.""

In general your English is passable.  On closer inspection your reading comprehension is rather poor, and your thought process disjointed (although that may not be connected).

I made a point that you had written a paragraph which nobody could begin to read, let alone address.

&gt;My point is you can't see any point which doesn't suit you and your anti-EU agenda. Just like idiot Farage quoting Think Tank paper because it was anti-immigrant and ignoring university paper, because it was pro-immigration.

Your English just dropped off again.    
It's every time you get angry.

Also, I don't think you appreciate what Think Tanks are and how they operate.  There's nothing wrong with quoting a Think Tank.

&gt;I can say exactly the same ""SPECULATION"" about what you just have said on increasing visas and getting more no-EU doctors/staff as AGAIN, if we have shortages now, something isn't that easy as you describe it as.

No you couldn't.  This is your reading comprehension again.   

I said that they COULD.  Not that they WOULD.     
I then gave an example of how they HAVE in the past.

Not as easy as I describe?  We literally have hundreds of thousands that already go through the visa system successfully. 

You are speculating because you are saying what would be, and then asserting it as fact.

&gt;Obviously if NHS heavily invested in EU recruitment, then it could even increase. We were discussing current scenario, not potential what NHS ""could do"".

LOL!!!

So you finally come around and try to move the goalposts.  

Want me to go back and see all the coulds and woulds?...

[ME (first comment)](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/27m2id/in_support_of_the_nhs_and_eu/ci24nas):

    ""Every single one of those health professionals could be 
     in the country without the EU. Just as many health 
     professionals who work for the NHS come from outside 
     the EU.""

Notice the *'COULD'*?   

Here was your response,

[You](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/27m2id/in_support_of_the_nhs_and_eu/ci26nzm): 

       ""Bullshit.""

So thank you.  You just accepted my point.


&gt; not saying about how much it WOULD COST as it's certainly not free, right?

What for the UK government to decide we should have more visas by changing a number on a page, and to hold a few career fayres and recruitment announcements in medical journals.

Hardly a great expense in the grand scheme of things.  Virtually inconsequential (and off the point - *again*).

&gt;What? You know EXACTLY why UK joined the EU? And the UK didn't know about it's expansion and what that would mean? 

I know exactly how the UK campaign was run to join the EC and the split post Bruges speech, yes.

&gt;The point stands, NHS currently has shortages and probably have had for a number of years already.

Y'up, thanks WHD and the EU.

&gt;Oh, so you prefer being seen by a doctor who has worked REALLY LONG hours? Right?

One that's done his training both in the classroom and on the wards without sacrificing one for the other?   Yes.  One that has plenty of experience before getting promotion? Yes.  That doesn't mean to the point of exhaustion, and it certainly doesn't mean not without oversight, but we should certainly not be lowering standards or be forced with EU imposed shortfalls.

Then again I have the interest of the NHS first in mind, whereas you seemed it condemnable for someone to want to put the UK first beyond some greater EU project.

&gt;And I don't see how that would happen, since you have said it yourself, that doctors with poor university would struggle to get into employment.

So you accept that point of mine too, now.  Thank you.

The point remains that if UK doctors have some of the best training in the world then regardless of where you recruit from it will involve some concessions, and you're never really in charge of your own quality control during training.

&gt;How is EU open borders reducing standards then? 

There's a lot more demand through a spiking population, for one.  So we need more staff, but without having the time to train or prepare accordingly.   How is the EU lowering standards?  Because the UK has higher standards and expectations than most, and certainly different in their own way from even the best.

EU standardisation needn't mean an improvement if you're already an advanced country having to make concessions for lesser developed countries to play catch up.

&gt; Unless of course you use the argument that NHS wouldn't have shortages if immigrants from the EU weren't coming here.... but that's a completely different topic so let's not start it.

How would you feel if there were a few people from the Bahamas on your basic with you? They're not British, why should we be paying for him to train?

&gt;The threat of violence isn't a reason for the government and police to stand idly by. 

Unfortunately, it *absolutely is* a reason. A very good reason. Here are your options on a city (or country)-wide flag ban as a member of the police/government:

* 1) Propose the ban seriously, watch the *entire fucking country* descend into rioting multiple times worse than the [very damaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_City_Hall_flag_protests) flag protests, which occured when *one* flag was decided to be flown on *fewer* days. The cost of policing this disturbance will run to the tens, quite possibly hundreds, of millions, there will hundreds if not thousands of arrests, I'd be surprised if there weren't a large number of deaths, forced relocations, massively increased tensions in mixed/interface areas, tens of thousands of people injured, huge hardening of sectarian attitudes and on top of all this, *the ban won't even work*. There's no way you can have enough police out to be physically stopping anyone, anywhere from putting up a flag or painting a kerbstone, and now you've got the problem of who to send to take them down. The blokes taking down the flag at city hall did so under cover of darkness, on top of a building set back from the street, so that they couldn't be id'd. How do you anonymously remove a union jack from a lamp-post in the middle of the newtownards road? 

* 2) Don't propose the ban, watch the country continue on as it has been, which is pretty shitty, but absolutely nowhere near as bad as scenario (1).

For the scale of the problem that would result, I've scaled up the effects of the flag protests *slightly*, by a factor of 10 at most. I'd be very, very surprised if a serious proposal to ban all flags and symbols (which is itself miles into hypothetical territory - which politician in this country would propose such a ban?) resulted in something only 10 times worse than the decision to limit the flying days of one flag.

So if we have to choose between an A&amp;E that will save 10 drowning/car crash victims (like me) per month (so 10 people * 40 years each = 400 years saved) and a diabetus clinic that will extend the lives of 100 people by a decade (so 100 * 10 = 1000 years saved) for the same cost, then the diabetics should get the cash because that's the most good for the cash available.  My time on earth is not worth more because I'm into sports and salad rather than smoking and McDonalds (sadly)

I agree that this causes a ""moral hazard"" where by people basically take less responsibility for themselves, but really, apart from a few rare genetic diseases, everything is environmental and so a lifestyle choice.

true,Jlowry13,,Newry. 384 1st pref votes. Baird's sausage rolls,"I actually stood for council in Newry this year. It went as well as one might expect.

Newry is interesting while it has its own feeder parades on the twelfth none of them get very far and none of them get to the city centre:

The Commons gets through some residential areas, but that liberty would be severely limited if they didn't have their own band, or if it wasn't a silver band. 

Altnaveigh manages it also but are rarely welcome, not even in their own hall, despite perhaps being more local than some of the whingers, again with their own pipe band its easier for them to retain that little bit of liberty, despite their slow pace. 

The rest of the Lodges and bands only get as far as the bus depot, not that there is much desire to go further but the option would be nice. 

The Apprentice Boys get to the Church of Ireland in the centre of town, but not without jeers from the Catholic Working Men's club. 



Although saying that there is never any bother, even when it hosted the twelfth and Black Saturday in consecutive years, bar from grumps writing in to the paper to give off. 

Benagh band has a parade every year too, which goes well but only they get as far as the war memorial.

We are from the area too, should our minority mean we shouldn't be allowed to express ourselves? 

Interestingly despite not wanting the parade through the city centre, in order to entice shoppers in the council asked the Commons band to play in the centre of town last time the twelfth was hosted, I don't think that plan worked but can think of at least one that certainly would.

I don't think the main procession is coming back to Newry for a few years yet but next year co. Armagh Twelfth is in Bessbrook. Despite being the largest twelfth in the country and visiting villages and towns in South Armagh county Armagh twelfth never has any bother, although the same can be said about most places outside of Belfast.

Belfast is odd, there is a greater paramilitary influence on the bands, many of whom see themselves as, ""Loyalists not Protestants,""  not to mention more important than the Orange, with the general depravity in working class areas, and the complete isolation of the two communities tensions are going to be there.

And this is before we add in the political capita of Republicans stopping the parade, occasionally stirring shit and the internal struggle between Sinn Fein and the dissidents in the Ardoyne.

Exactly, questions like this are up for debate, but the quiz only had the options of true and false. There are some historians who even question that it was a revolution, and that very little changed between the reign of James II and the reigns of Anne and William.

Plus, I'm not sure what the point is of just doing these fact checking questions. Somebody learning that the 'English Civil War' (maybe I'm being a pedant, but the 'First Civil War' is better) started in 1642 tells them nothing about it's significance in Crown-Parliament relations, just that there was a Civil War and it started in 1642.

true,kylotan,null,null,"&gt; Halls: around £5000 for a standard room. All bills, utilities and food included.

Food's only included if you're able to be there for food serving times. Most of my friends in halls weren't really able to live around regimented dinner times and didn't see all the benefit from this. (Also, I think it contributes to the ongoing infantilizing of students, but hey, that's a different matter.)

Also, £5000 is basically all of your loan, as I understand it. If you go down this route you either have to be independently wealthy, confident of a big maintenance grant, or confident you're going to find extra work.

&gt; Rent: £60 (which is very cheap) x approx 50 weeks = £3000
&gt; Food: £30 x approx 50 weeks = £1500

I would argue that it is possible to eat for less than £30 a week. But perhaps more importantly, you're comparing 50 weeks of living in a house with 30 weeks of living in halls. Whether this is valid or not is likely to depend on whether someone is able to whizz back to the parental home on the last day of term or not, and on whether you have to get a 12 month house contract or not.

If this really is psychologically critical for you then I guess it's better than not paying off your debts. But if you can pay off highest interest first (whilst keeping up minimum payments on other debts) and console yourself with the fact this will be quicker and cheaper, and look at you total net worth slowly (or perhaps not so slowly) creep out of minus territory, then that's a better approach in purely financial terms.

Ramsey is selling motivation. There is plenty of good financial guidance out there for basic stuff (getting out of debt, saving up an emergency fund, etc), and a fair bit of motivation too.

I've a strange feeling this is never going to happen). This is cutting *everyone's* nose off to spite *everyone else's* face; proposing something that, whilst right in principle, will have virtually zero positive effects (if any) and will cause an awful lot of real violence to happen to an awful lot of real people.

Proposing a ban like this would, without a single shred of doubt, release a metric fuckton of violence and hate in this country, given that an similar but much, much, much, much more tame decision cost us hundreds of arrests, £20 million in policing, disruptive riots, protests, increases in sectarian tensions and the rest of it.

It would also, without a single shred of doubt, prove extremely ineffective - to the point of utter uselessness - because it's an unenforcable law. The manpower does not exist to prevent flags/whatever being put up anywhere, at any time, and there's no practical way to remove them because no-one wants to be known as the worker who took them down (any more than the city hall flag workers did, in a much less dangerous position).

true,QggOne,null,null,"&gt; I think people need to stop being offended by flags.

By the existence of said flag? Sure. But when a flag is used for offensive purposes or to symbolise something offensive then people are going to be offended. It's impossible to stop this.
You can stick a swastika from the reichstag in a meuseum dedicated to world war 2 and it's seen as historical, understandable and completely inoffensive. If you stand outside a Jewish temple swinging it around it's offensive. (note I'm not comparing the union flag to the swastika, I'm comparing circumstances) 
Flags aren't inherently good or bad. It's how they are used that matters and I think the Union flag is being used nastily in this situation. When you place a flag of that size, strategically in a mixed area you are trying to intimidate rather than celebrate.

&gt; Yes they should be kept in good order (clean/whole) and not necessarily placed everywhere but are we really saying that it is acceptable for people to be 'intimidated' by a flag?

When flags are used for the purpose of intimidation, sometimes they will achieve their goals.

&gt; What are these catholic children being taught that you think they will be affected by seeing a union flag?

There's no message being taught to the children. They realise from a young age that there is a divide in northern ireland. They see people from the other side of the divide placing huge flags everywhere and entering into the area despite of local resistance. It would like intimidation to a child I'd assume.

&gt; Would they be equally affected by seeing a tricolour?

At a young age? No. Now I find it embarrassing. Do you know how awkward it is to invite some friends over who are unionists? Even worst there are some IRA symbols around. It's not nice. I'd rather they felt welcome.

&gt; I think it's time we stopped painting flags and kerb-stones as the bogey men here. The real problem are people who use such symbols to reinforce bigoted views. Banning those symbols, except for UVF/IRA flags etc, is not the way forward. Promoting respect for all flags is.

And I think removing flags from public property would be a step forward. To large of a step for now though. I'd settle for a rental charge placed on flag polls and other public facilities if flags are placed on them.

You've got your work cut out for you. I strongly suggest you join the National Autistic Society and become active on their boards. There's a monumental wealth of information and help there. There should also be a local autistic support group. Make use of them. 

&gt; he is often shut up in my daughters room on his laptop 24/7.

Don't feel bad about him doing this. This is perfectly normal for an autistic person to do - they live in their own world. 

Another thing you may find is that he'll have a very restricted diet and when it comes to food have some wierd demands. My son for example will only eat white/light brown coloured food and nothing ""wet"" so nothing with sauce on like baked beans. He also cannot have anything on a plate touching something else so say he has sausage and mash, the sausages cannot touch the mash. Also in his mind Cheese and Onion crisps come in a blue or green packet - god forbid we try and give him Seabrook. You're going to notice a lot of this and similar odd behaviour over the coming weeks. Just go with it, don't try to change it.

&gt; he also really needs to get out of this house and socialise with some people his own age/ability

Yeah, not really likely to happen in the way you or I would see as being normal. Autistic people find it really hard to deal with social situations. DO NOT TRY AND FORCE IT. At the moment his head will be all over the place and he'll have retreated into his own world where he feels safe. Let him be for now. 

&gt; She does not work and the only benefits she receives is a carers allowance for him which she spends on drugs and alcohol.

Contact the DWP and inform them of the new situation. They'll stop the claim so that's £250 a month she won't be getting. Whilst you're there notify them of the change of address and get them to send the DLA entitlement letter etc to your address. That should help get the prescription issue sorted. 

&gt; Ideally we need Mum to leave the house so my bro and his dad (and our 16 year old sister who is has also been forced our and currently living with my friends mum in Portsmouth) can move back home. But she is refusing to do this. 

Sadly this is going to involve the court and be a long drawn out process which probably won't be sorted until the divorce and once the sale of the house is forced. Your father should look for somewhere else, phone up everyone he's paying the bills for with the exception of the mortgage company and tell them he's moved and stop paying the bills for your mums house other than the mortgage.

If we have reached an agreement on his personal terms but he is still waiting then i would imagine that something has been communicated to his representatives along the lines of ""we are interested but it is a fluid situation, if he can wait until after the WC then the situation may be clearer."" from another club(s) that could potentially benefit him more personally.


Seems like Arsenal have had some interest in him but almost seems as if Remy is the fail-safe for them....if they are unable to land a blockbuster name as a striker, well they can grab Remy. He has been quoted as saying that he would love to play for Chelsea which would be a massive longshot....but if he lights it up at the WC suddenly his options may change.

I think he would be a solid pickup for us as much as he is a mercenary he is also a proven PL commodity who fills a role for us.  Would I like him (or any other player for that matter) to express how much he loves Spurs and that it is a dream to play for the club?...absolutely. But i also realize that not every player fits this situation and sometimes to improve the club you have to bring in players who are looking out for themselves above all else.

Some word out of the court over the last half hour or so:

* LUFC see it as a 'can pay but won't pay' situation
* Haigh supposedly wanted to 'shackle' the club to him by lending it cash without the approval of the club's board
* Haigh = Sport Capital
* Sport Capital's lawyer says 'Haigh is not the one serving the petition, he just wants the money back'

As for socialising, he used to volunteer at St John's Ambulance, I'm going to make some enquiries there and when he's ready see if he'd like to transfer there. I also just started my 3 year old at a martial arts class which he said he'd be interested in. I'm not too sure about this because he struggles with anything physical due to his dyspraxia.

As much as I'd love to say that this was a British value, I honestly don't think it is. Moralism is fairly prevalent throughout society; it may be more common on the right, but the left is fairly socially conservative too in many regards. Anything that people aren't used to, they tend to be against. I suppose an example would be the whole gay marriage issue - yes, most people are OK with gays now, but thats because homosexuality has been brought slowly into mainstream acceptance over the past few decades, rather than because its harmless and doesn't affect anyone else. Allowing something purely because the consensus is that it is 'normal' is hardly liberalism in action, it is just a change in societal values. I would argue the same is true of many other issues relating to personal liberty.

In reality, we sit somewhere between being social conservatives, who hold onto old values, and social moderates, who are willing to adapt to new social norms, but are far from being a nation of liberals who accept that the 'normality' of something bears little relation to whether you should be allowed to do it.",0,1402413541,null,0,1402413761,0,ci3wzcy,t3_27s3co,t1_ci3wzcy,t1_ci3u0gv,null,1434176111,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

To some extent British values have become western values. Voltaire looked to Britain as an example of a liberal state, in contrast to absolutist France. The American revolution, and their nation's founding laws, were inspired by British values. During the 19th Century, Britain was often ahead of other nations when it came to expanding suffrage, countries had revolutions to achieve what we had achieved decades earlier. Britain, America, and France contributed heavily to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; he struggles with anything physical due to his dyspraxia. 

He may not actually have that and have been mis-diagnosed. The symptoms of dyspraxia are traits of autism.  Balance problems, lack of fine motor skills and co-ordination, speech being affected are all things autistic people suffer from. 

&gt; I also just started my 3 year old at a martial arts class which he said he'd be interested in.

You will find he'll get to a point where he can't progress because he will have problems with balance so don't expect much beyond yellow belt. You may also find that he won't like being in bare feet due to the feeling of the floor on his skin so will probably need to wear at least socks so make sure you explain to the instructor that he's autistic. Been there, done that. 

The St. John's Ambulance definitely sounds like a go-er. Basically you want to look at groups where things are regimented to some extent with rules. St. John's Ambulance meetings for example will have quite a regimented routine for meetings with a roll call, a period of instruction/talk then a break and final parade and it'll pretty much follow that most weekly meetings. Things with creativity or abstract are a non-starter. You will need to research fully what happens and spend time with him prior to going explaining what goes on and what to expect. It may be an idea to take photographs of things like the building, the entrance, the room its in, the people who run it he'll meet and go through it a few times on the run up to his first visit. We've found that if you explain the person interested in is autistic that those running the club/group are quite accommodating at what seems a strange request at first. You'll stand more chance of success than just turning up where the result may be that you won't even get him through the front door. Autistic people don't cope well with unfamiliarity. 

Anyway all of this stuff and other things that'll make life infinitely easier you can find out about on the NAS forums. ",0,1402414679,null,0,1402415363,0,ci3xitr,t3_27s14w,t1_ci3xitr,t1_ci3wpfd,null,1434176366,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Oh, final suggestion. [Behavior Balance DMG from Victoria Health](http://www.victoriahealth.com/product/Behavior-Balance-DMG/3366) is something recommended by people on the NAS boards. If he'll take pills get the tablet form otherwise get the liquid and put it in some juice like blackcurrent juice as its purple in colour. Get one bottle and try it. If it works you should notice a change in a few days and a notable change in a week. If you don't then don't bother continuing with it. 

Its nothing nasty, just a mix of vitamins and minerals that have been found to help autistic kids cope with things in about 50% of cases and is often recommended to try on the NAS boards. It calmed our son down and he became a lot less violent and it helped him to the point he's able to stay in mainstream school. Its not a downer, it doesn't make them feel drowsy. As I said though get just one course and try it.

Another update for you.

Looks like we are stuck at 3 teams.

This might have to be called off as we are fast approaching the time. 

What I will do however is leave the money set aside and roll it over into another event. 

If anyone wants to join into a new venture with me regarding this please direct message me and we can sort something out. I fear my inexperience and lack of marketing resulting in this situation. 

A huge thank you to everyone who took the time to sign up and send other emails in support. You guys are rock stars. Im sorry I couldn't get this going for you all. 3 teams just isnt enough to justify the outlay and time required.

Kindest regards,
Resetswitch

You have a distorted view of who is responsible for the harm that would be caused. You can leave your blame at the door of those actually responsible for causing the act of physical harm upon others, not me.

Talk about twisted.

For a guy with such a passion for argument, you appear to be totally deaf when it comes to basic understanding of clearly stated arguments. Which is odd, given that you appear to have no problem whatsoever understanding the arguments of those who will kill and threaten to get their way. 

It's hard for me to understand what's so difficult for you to comprehend why someone might just be fed up with those people getting their own way all the time. Like it's so difficult to understand why someone who's spent their whole life looking at the visual nightmare that is tribal flag-waving would be sick of it? Really? That's beyond your comprehension? That's odd. So that's why I'm being snarky - because you're being wilfully dismissive of one argument (those who are sick of flags) but slavishly defensive of the other (Loyalist's having the right to threaten a country full of people with violence.)

I'll still for a ban on flags, unrealistic as it, because unlike you I don't feel like compromising with terrorists and thugs. And I make zero apology for it. If it's really that difficult for you to wrap your head around that, then I'm afraid you're either being wilfully contrary for the sake of it, or worse - just simple.

Whether or not we want to live in a society where men can threaten murder and get their way accordingly, and be defended by those unwilling to risk poking a sleeping giant at the expense of everyone's freedom to live in a society that isn't dominated by sectarian aggression, is another thing entirely. I'd rather not live in that society. You would. That's the difference.

What you're talking about is the understanding in society of what constitutes harm or a proper balance of rights, and yes of course that evolves.

2. The value of cost averaging is disputed and so I don't think it's honest to simply state it as a ""truth"".

3. Tax shelters save you more if you pay more tax. This is ""unconventional""?

4. I'm not sure what the point of this is. Yes, there can still be some tax effect inside a S&amp;S ISA, though I thought this was fairly well known. It still has advantages.

5. Well, interest rates are expected to rise, so duh.

6. As far as I know, ISAs are like any other general asset for the purposes of IHT. I'm not sure why people would expect otherwise. It's the growth that is tax-sheltered.

7. I'm not sure what point they're trying to make here.

8. Not sure why this is ""unconventional"" or unexpected, though I can see it's something people might not look up unless they're thinking of emmigrating. (As per juu4's comment and my reply, this may actually be unconventional, but false.)

9. This rather contradicts point #2, and isn't necessarily true. For example, if you might need the money during the tax year but might be in a position to return it to the ISA again later (except you might not be able to, as you used the allowance on the first deposit).

10. An ISA isn't really a ""pension"". It would be better to say it can be used for saving for retirement. It may or may not be a good idea, depending on personal circumstances - the issue is not a simple one.

I don't know of anyone, by which I mean interested groups/parties: the NSS, the BHA etc., does that. What those groups focus on is that it is wrong that it is so woven based on fundamental fairness, and that it is wrong because the majority of the population are not practising Christians. I will agree with ~50% identifying at Christian, but certainly the fraction of active religious people in the UK is now a minority.

The 'response' to the ""It's a Christian country"" claim (that you make here - with entirely reasonable points none of which I dispute) is due to it being just a statement' that it is then used in the circular-dance I outlined above. That was all.

It's like saying: ""The UK is a white country"", and then outlining how the history etc. is white based and dominated.

United Kingdom (typically a serving member of the armed forces, or a diplomat),

meet the residence qualification because they have become non-resident, have 
ceased to perform duties as a Crown employee serving overseas, or have ceased 
to be married to, or in a civil partnership with, such a person. 
 
An existing ISA need not be closed, but no further subscriptions to the ISA can be 
made unless and until the investor meets the residence qualification again.'

true,AliAskari,null,null,"&gt; Take placing a bet on England winning the world cup for example, most of us would agree that it's a long shot but the odds offered don't reflect that because the volume of bets would clean out the bookies if it did come in.

That wouldn't clean out the bookies at all.

It's counter-intuitive but bookies *love an upset*. 

To continue with a footballing example: as a rule the money required to pay out on long-odd bets should Macclesfield Town beat Real Madrid will be dwarfed by the sums gained from punters trying to win easy money with a ""safe bet"" on Real Madrid winning.

Bookies odds aren't just made up. They're designed to reflect the likelyhood of an eventuality, with the bookies margin factored in to the competing odds.

To further clarify. Just because a bookmaker offers odds of 33/1 on an eventuality doesn't mean there's a 33/1 chance of it happening. But it does mean that they believe it to be less likely than the opposite eventuality with odds of 2/1 from the same bookie.

Only then can you choose the route of lucrative self-employment.  It's worth saying that the precise nature of the supplier of goods and services under global capitalism is usually heavily obfuscated, often deliberately so, because the conditions under which they are provided, if they were transparently set out, would probably be unpalatable to many who buy them.  Indeed, this is, in large part, an important role of money in modern society.  If consumers were to meet face to face with the people who produce their cheap junk from the developing world and personally sanction the conditions in which they work/produce, and to live with the consequences in their close circle of friends and local community, many would find it extremely hard to continue to do so.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Whilst the polling does suggest that no will be ahead, there are two other elements at play:

1. Most of the polling shows very high turnout figures (normal polling would filter by those who say that they are less likely to turn up to vote, but they can't do that with these figures because there is such a high percentage of people who say that they are 10/10 certain to turn up EDIT: [Panelbase's](http://www.panelbase.com/media/polls/F4108w11ScottishSundayTimestables.pdf) latest data shows 936/1036 8 - 10 out of 10 likely to show and vote.  A 90% turnout rate would be extraordinary)
2. When it comes to actual voting, people are more likely to vote with the status quo than what they tell polling companies (EDIT in the above example there were 125 'undecided', but who are 8 - 10 out of 10 to vote, who are more likely to vote 'no' because it is the status quo) 

So it isn't as clear cut as that, but 'no' being ahead and having the status quo vote should make it a win for them, but the bookies are predicting it to be close (57 - 43).

However, they didn't. Rodgers and ownership stood strong, they kept Suarez and we had a magical season in which we almost won the League (keeping in mind that merely getting 4th place was the expectation) and Suarez won the Golden Boot, Player of the Year, etc.

Is it a money thing? Maybe that's what it is. Could LFC turn down a £100m offer?

Well, in my opinion, we probably needed the, say, £60+m *more* last summer than we need the £100m *this* summer.

&gt;""There remains a suspicion inside Anfield that someone is trying to get other clubs to bid for Moreno by suggesting a fee has been agreed in the hope a bigger offer is made by a rival.""

I'm not necessarily trying to start a rant about rivals trying to disrupt our transfer process but I did want to generate a discussion about the importance of how LFC and FSG are perceived this season, in a sort of political/business sense.

I think the general narrative has become: Liverpool can be lured into overspending or LFC can be used as a pawn to drive up the fee for a player.

I think with such a wonderful finish to the season and a Champions League spot, we have finally put ourselves in a position where we can walk away and move on to other targets and that will send a message to boardrooms around the world.

For example, would I pay £30m for Adam Lallana? Yah, probably. And I think we can afford that fee too and not have a problem signing other players.

However. With our valuation of Lallana sitting anywhere between £20-25m, I think it would be a huge message that we're not that ""desperate"" over-spending club any more if we say, ""No thanks"" to the 30 million and simply move on. And, actually, that's what it seems like we're doing and I hope we can stay on that message this summer.",0,1402421114,null,0,false,0,ci40sev,t3_27sui6,t1_ci40sev,t3_27sui6,null,1434177905,37,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,37

Conversely, Americans are more open to having fun. They are constantly ready to be entertained and don't need any sarcasm to filter their enjoyment through.  
I'd say British values are cynicism, good humour in adversity, and a distrust of pomposity or bombast.

Join a few societies in your first year and actually go to their events. I'd also recommend joining a sports club on campus too, it's really easy to get fat over the course of your studies lol.

Also, try and get a job in the SU. Or, Frontrunners positions. Wish I had taken more advantage of the employment opportunities. 
There's also this volunteering thing you should check out.

If they wish to indoctrinate (in the truest sense) kids through instilling the religion/religious values in as many lessons etc. as possible: then it is not fair on the children (the majority of whom are likely to be from non-religious families) or morally right as the state is paying for it rather than the religious group themselves.

If they are not indoctrinating: then there's no reason for the school to be faith run in the first place.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt; You just argued we should lower our own standards to further the rest of the world. Sorry. No.

I didn't do it, it's your own perception of such. The fact someone has an easier way to enter employment in the UK, doesn't mean that UK is lowering standards, just because in one of those countries standards of something may be lower.

&gt;You were specifically talking about levels of qualifications, and that's exactly what employers will do - especially when the analogy is applied in practicality.

What? Jesus, mate, you have a rare ability to see and imagine things. I wasn't talking about levels of qualification when you compare medical studies did by some shamans with the ones currently recognised as suitable for such role. It is GMC who recognises (or not) certain qualifications, based on the country these were done and level of education they have. GMC allows all (?) EU medical qualifications to be used as appropriate for GMC registration in the UK, without the need to supply documents, other than basic ones. It's differently though with registrations with HPC (for example physiotherapy), where this organisation hasn't recognised qualifications internationally. To sum it up for you, it all related to qualifications recognised by institutions (if required) from certain places.

&gt;In general your English is passable

Are we discussing topics connected with NHS and the EU or have you somehow became an English teacher now? Use your intelligence and TRY do understand sentences which in your opinion aren't to your standard of discussion.

&gt;There's nothing wrong with quoting a Think Tank.

Unless of course they clearly show certain agenda and often lack proper university-type research.

&gt;So thank you. You just accepted my point.

""Could"", as long as other criteria are met but we weren't discussing these. We could even discuss the fact that UK could do something about education in the UK, so that it wouldn't require any immigrant doctors/nurses at all. The whole point I wanted to make was that there certainly would be less EU doctors, if UK wasn't part of the EU.... but of course that is based on no other changes being done as we were NOT discussing these, just making a simple point of one thing.

&gt;What for the UK government to decide we should have more visas by changing a number on a page, and to hold a few career fayres and recruitment announcements in medical journals.

Yeah, you really are brilliant in seeing things from only yours, the most correct, point of view. I really doubt that such costs are only these and only so small... but as you've said it yourself, we are getting off the discussion.

&gt;I know exactly how the UK campaign was run to join the EC 

So you say that campaign was only based on positives to the UK and nobody mentioned that there could be negatives, such as paying more than getting out of the EU? I bet someone mentioned that and the public was aware this could be a case.

&gt;Y'up, thanks WHD and the EU.

I've lost you, what WHD is?

&gt;That doesn't mean to the point of exhaustion, and it certainly doesn't mean not without oversight, but we should certainly not be lowering standards or be forced with EU imposed shortfalls.

And how would you control that if there wasn't a WTD? You would ""rely"" on personal control? Maybe the same should apply to lorry drivers as well? Let's give them an option to decide for themselves or make some Micky Mouse supervision where his controller will call him every hour and ask how he feels and can whether he can drive for couple of more hours.

&gt;Then again I have the interest of the NHS first in mind, whereas you seemed it condemnable for someone to want to put the UK first beyond some greater EU project.

Nope, you seem to have some kind of misconception on basic topics. Of course NHS is important and it's a shame there are shortages but patients are also important and shouldn't be seen by doctors working 60h per week, just because NHS cannot resolve an issue of staff shortages in NHS since 1998.

&gt;The point remains that if UK doctors have some of the best training in the world then regardless of where you recruit from it will involve some concessions, and you're never really in charge of your own quality control during training

As I've mentioned in one of the above, training quality is controlled by GMC and I absolutely see no problem with GMC's requirements if they find out that teaching system in one of the EU countries isn't good enough for the level of medical care in the UK. I suppose EU can't force anything like that if there is indeed a problem with level of education.

Since it was agreed that level is fine, employing doctors from the EU is now easier as it doesn't require other processes, which are required from non-EU staff.

&gt;So we need more staff, but without having the time to train or prepare accordingly

OK, I will agree partially with it but only in connection with certain sectors, like NHS. Why partially? Because I do not think that standards in the EU differ so much, even in medicine (which takes longest to learn). Also partially because the free movement meant skilled EU workers can come here more easily, hence reducing the gap of possible shortages.

Your main problem is that you regard the UK too often as the greatest country in the whole world and forget that even UK can learn and even from poorer countries. I have experienced it myself in relation to my work (medical) as well as plenty other fields. Just because sometimes statistics indicate one thing, it doesn't mean such is real. For example, you could argue that UK drivers are better than ones in Poland, based on statistic showing higher fatality rate there, when compared with the UK. The fact is though that it cannot be easily counted (if counted at all) as you can't compare fatal road accidents in countries which have different roads.

I'm getting more and more convinced that UK's problem (and the ones shown by nationalists like you) is exactly the above. You think of your country in superlatives and don't even take into account the possibility that the rest is not always shit.

I think UK has many positives but I also know it could learn even from poorer countries like Poland and vice versa. Having closer connections via the EU is a good step towards such cooperation.",0,1402423620,null,0,false,0,ci423tz,t3_27m2id,t1_ci423tz,t1_ci3t6ay,null,1434178592,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

£15 a week for a room??? The very minimum you'd be looking to pay for a room in a decent house is £50pw. I would be extremely skeptical of anyone renting anything for £15pw. Something to bear in mind is that wherever there is a large student population there is alot of people looking to take advantage of the unsuspecting.

From personal experience, with student loans to live off, I survived quite happily in halls for a year with no additional funding apart from a uni bursary. If you are lucky to come from a well off background it is common for parents to supplement your loans with cash. If you're from low income background, the university offers bursaries which you do not pay back (free money for you) of up to £1100 per year while I was there, this may be more by now. If you're still worried, a weekend job may be your answer, but I wouldn't do this in the first few months of uni. I worked during my entire 4th year and it really helped my beer fund to earn as little as £200-300 a month.

My advice: work out your money per month. Minus any expenditure such as cost of accommodation (and bills and food if in a house). What is left is yours to do with as you please. Divide this by 4, you have your weekly ""fun"" money. If this isnt enough, reduce expenditure or increase income by work/family.

Even now with a full time job, a partner and a son, I stick to this strategy and I've been saving for a mortgage since Christmas, only 6 months after I left uni of Nottingham. ",0,1402423868,null,0,false,0,ci428hk,t3_27qfav,t1_ci428hk,t1_ci3zacd,null,1434178653,1,false,nottingham,t5_2qmbu,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"I see what your saying, but /u/will_holmes explicity said;

&gt;being allowed to do what you want so long as it does not harm others.

which is largely what I was responding to. Perhaps not a point about liberalism as a whole so much as social liberalism. I am of the opinion that beyond those liberties which are vital to the functioning of the country, people, by and large would, either not agree with /u/will_holmes statement, or agree with it, but then take an extremely broad interpretation of what causes harm. 

&gt;What you're talking about is the understanding in society of what constitutes harm or a proper balance of rights, and yes of course that evolves.

I'm more referring to the belief that people should largely be allowed to live their lives as they choose; its more to do with civil liberties than peoples personal opinions on what they like and don't like. The change in various societal values can be somewhat independent of that - certainly there is a certain interplay between changing values and what people are willing to accept, but my contention is more that people are unwilling, or at least hesitant to accept things they are uncomfortable or unfamiliar with. However, the liberal position shouldn't really change, regardless of changes in the personal opinions liberals may have about whatever potential freedom we are discussing, as the principle that, as you say;

&gt;freedoms are not granted by the powers that be but are ours by right.

necessitates the assumption that we have the right to freedoms in the first place. Thus from the liberal perspective when determining whether something should or should not be allowed, you must start from the assumption that it is acceptable, and require evidence that it causes harm (or infringes upon other, more important freedoms) for it to be restricted. So while a liberal may feel differently about an issue, depending on the societal values of the time, if they are being consistent with their philosophy, their opinion on whether it should be allowed or not, should, at least in theory, be unchanging. 

Of course, it would be silly to pretend this is an absolute truth (and disingenuous to pretend I have never been guilty of making fairly reactionary judgements of various social issues myself), but to some degree, liberalism requires tolerance, even of things you might dislike, and this is where I feel our society isn't particularly liberal. I used the example of gay marriage in my previous post; the point I was trying to make was that in a society in which homosexuality is seen by many as normal, allowing gays to marry isn't a particularly liberal thing to do.
Perhaps certain liberals helped push acceptance of homosexuality into the mainstream, but the increase in acceptance for gay marriage and other LGBT issues over the past few decades is largely due to people seeing it as normal, or at least acceptable, rather than because they believe that people should basically be allowed to do whatever they want, so long as it doesn't harm others. 

Society may well be becoming more accepting, as a general rule at least, and this is certainly a good thing, but this doesn't inherently translate to society being more liberal. We might accept more things as normal, but people still look at an issue and demand reasons we should accept it, rather than asking why we shouldn't.",0,1402425850,null,0,false,0,ci439sx,t3_27s3co,t1_ci439sx,t1_ci3yexu,null,1434179142,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0
