&gt; The purpose of any human rights protection is to protect the rights of those whom the majority are unwilling to protect: democracy values everyone equally even if the majority do not

The act essentially covers one of the two, sometimes opposed, planks of a civilised nation. Human rights are about liberty. A democracy is free to make judgements that damage liberty but it cannot then claim to be a liberal civilised state. Democracy without liberty is just the two wolfs and a sheep deciding what is for dinner that is all too commonly quoted.

That is why the much maligned Americans have it somewhat right. We can argue about whether the American bill of rights is fit for purpose or not but recognising that rights are as important as democracy itself and thus making it part of the constitution of the country is entirely right.

true,LFCfanatic999,lfc99,,"I'm not sure if many on here have actually watched Aubameyang actually play to make an honest assessment of what he can bring to a team besides of just knowing what they read from small passages in blogs or the paper or the odd youtube clip. I've written this before somewhere, but I've seen Aubameyang play many times on my travels to St. Etienne to visit family for the holidays and I can tell you he's the real deal. Aubameyang singlehandedly almost dragged ASSE into the Champions League. He was playing for a team which has the same financial clout as a lower midtable Premiership team at best with co-owners who fight tooth and nail not to spend money, who the best players in the team are the likes of Brandao, Gradel, Cohade, Lemoine, etc. thought Hamouma and Zouma are the young shining stars. (Kurt going to Chelsea is going to be a mistake for him.)


Some will say his touch and control are a lot to be desired, but I don't think that's the case. In my opinion, he's got many skills to offer which contribute to him being utilized in different positions rather than his natural forward position. Similar with Sturridge and Walcott in their early days. He holds the ball well, plays the counter very quickly, crisp snap shot, and due to his speed he's very deceiving on his positioning as he can make up ground very quickly to be in a good spot. He does very well with the purgatorial head-to-waist balls in the box. His first year was a bit of a wash after his bright start, but I think the main issues that affected his performance was the transition to another league, the different language, along with BVB's season capitulating along with the pressure of trying to keep up with that Bayern machine. Similar results with many players who arrive to a new league. With the football world permanently changing to and ""instant investment, instant return"" mentality it's tough for any player and we've definitely been spoiled by the goal glut from the squad this season. With him only being 24, the long term investment is pretty decent. Still, almost a 1:2 goals-to-game ratio is not too shabby for a return and yes, there was even a time when Luis Suarez had the same 1:2 ratio. Shocking, I know.


But if the release clause is that low (which I doubt), I'd definitely say go for it. Of course there is the debate that Liverpool wouldn't actually need to have him in the squad. Liverpool is back to playing on Tuesday and Wednesdays and I think with the quality the team is adding, there's a decent assumption that Liverpool will play in the later rounds in the domestic cups as well. Luis is playing on a long season, short rest, and a bump knee. Sturridge has had his slight injury problems as well. As much as I am excited about Rickie Lambert, I think we need (4) solid strikers to be able to compete on all fronts. Yes, we have Borini and we have some upcoming players in the reserves but I don't think there is any comparison between the two and PEA would be a tremendous upgrade especially with his European football experience. Plus with the 4-3-3 system that Rodgers plays at times, I think it would be a great position for him to slot in without leaving him out on the wings too long. I think it would be a great bit of business to take him on board for that plus since his first season was a bit average, I don't think he'd command exorbitant wages. Obviously not every transfer works out and he could be a dud, but he's got the skillset to be successful in the Premiership. Still, I don't think BVB would sell him.

Newborn adders aren't more venomous than fullgrown adders, but they will exhaust their entire venom reserve in the hopes that it will be enough to survive, whereas fullygrown adders have more self control and only use enough venom to give them a fighting chance and store enough venom to then go on and hunt prey as well. 

Takes a lot of energy for a venomous snake to replenish their venom, so if they are confident enough that a bite will scare away whatever stepped/attacked them they will sometimes even do a drybite (no venom expelled) since lack of venom = no prey = no energy = slow and agonizing death for the snake.

Any venom a snake has to expend just to fight of an attacker is wasted since the animals/humans that attack the snake aren't usually on their menu of prey.

* Are you certain on the £30 road tax? That's the rate for a very low emission car. Not certain a £1,500 banger is making it into that bracket. The next bracket up is £100 more.

* Have you considered the cost of up-front v monthly payment on the insurance? You don't have the up-front cash to pay it all at once (the cheaper option in the long run). Can you afford the (higher) monthly payment?

* What's the actual drive like from where you live to your university? Urban? Rural? Much traffic? If it's an urban drive with any stop-start traffic, you won't get anything like 50 mpg. If it's an out-of-town A road, you probably will.

* Driving 150 miles a week (plus whatever you do at weekends) means your petrol budget is already on the ambitious side. Don't be surprised if it's more like £1,000 per year.

* You can bet on an MOT costing £30-40 plus the cost of any work the car needs to pass the test.

* A decent service will cost between £100 and £150, which rises as the car ages and needs more work done.

* A few odd items: brake replacements (pads and discs all round) should cost you £200-250. Tyres about £50 each.

I don't think Van Gaal did anything too revolutionary or amazing. In fact, all he really did was copy the strategy the United States used to knock of Spain at the 2009 Confederations Cup; pack the middle with bodies, give up the wings, and try to beat them playing a fast, direct counter-attack.

Moreover, Spain looked tired, physically and mentally, and it makes sense; most of their squad is from 3 teams, Real Madrid (3 players), Barcelona (7 players), and Athletico Madrid (4 players). All 3 of these teams made it to the semi-final of the Copa Del Ray, and at least the Quarterfinals of the Champion's League, with Athletico and Real play a further 3 games to face each other in the final; many of those players played more than 50 games since last summer between a grueling Spanish Liga, the CL, and the Copa del Rey, on top of WC Qualifiers. They're tired, and the heart of their squad is over or approacing 30; Ramos and Pique are 28 &amp; 27 respectively, and the heart of their midfield, Iniesta, Xavi, and Xabi Alonso are all 30 or older.

That game was less a tactical masterclass by Van Gaal and more another example of using the U.S. blueprint of how to beat Spain. Spain, for their part, looked tired and completely devoid of ideas. They never tried to exploit the wings, they just constantly tried to play straight through the middle of the field against 6 defenders.

Finally, you always knew the Dutch were going to be preparing for this game for 4 years. A repeat of a final the Dutch thought was stolen from them, I'm sure Van Gaal didn't have to do a single thing to motivate this team for this game, and I'm sure he prepared them primarily for this game.

It looks nice but it is pricey and for the money you get a room with an en suite bang in the centre of anywhere you'll need to go. There's a Lidls beside it, both unions are a 2 minute walk away and the casino is there if you fancy that as well as the overgate being 5 minutes away. 

My major issue is that the staff have been coming in the flat without giving the notice that is in the contract - it sounds small but it's happened quite a lot. Another thing is that because the office is shut on weekends so if someone makes a mess in the corridors then it'll be there till Monday e.g. stinking kebab meat with sauce...

There's quite a few small things that have annoyed me about it but there's also good stuff so if you want to know any more just ask and I'll get back to you.

Also just for noseyness what uni/course you going to?

The transfer policy during that time was to buy young players for low fees (which you would have to accept wasn't the policy of other clubs including Chelsea at the time because they didn't have the necessity to do it). Nasri was quite well known when he signed to Arsenal, but the fans view is that Van Persie and Adebayor and some others were taken on by the club as nobodies, developed into world class players and then they leave because the club now can't match their ambition. There was a feeling that they owed the club. The distaste was intensified by their comments on their way out the door.

I can definitely empathise with you feeling as though you've underachieved by getting a B grade in an exam and I don't think anyone should make you feel bad for wanting more than that grade; even if it is a pass. Everyone has different expectations and hopes for themselves and you shouldn't feel guilty for that.
I'm admittedly already a little terrified about receiving my results because I know that I'll beat myself up for not getting my predicted grades, even in the subjects that I'm not taking for my A Levels. It's the fact that I know I could have got the top grade if I had really put myself under even more pressure or if I had revised even more.
I seem like a hypocrite for saying this but as long as you get five C grades you can get into sixth form and ultimately universities look at your A Level results to determine if you can get in. Personally I know that if I don't get my predicted grades I will be motivated by it to really push myself in my AS and A Levels. 
I wouldn't worry too much though, you're definitely not the only one who is paranoid about their exam results.

Fetdatzidis plays as a #10, and most definitely should have started there. Kone behind him. Left and right wingers were very ineffective, and our left back was anonymous. Had Santos brought our 18-22 year olds he left out of the squad had played them we would have matched Colombia for pace and perhaps beaten them in stamina (stamina is really focused on in Greece).

Stupid decision by the coach.

He even left out the best CF in Greece - Athanasiadis - in favor of Gekas. Athanasiadis didn't even make the squad because of Gekas. Gekas who touched the ball 3-4 times during the match and missed our best opportunity.

There's a fixation that Santos (and many Greeks) has on experience - and in many situations he prefers experience to youth and raw talent. Klinsmann running the Greek squad would be a serious treat.

true,anOrphanedPlatypus,null,null,"I have been looking at purchasing a car recently and was in the exact same position. I have similar savings and am in a similar position with income.

I was looking at getting a 1.6 civic 2005 model for about £2000. As it's so old it would require a decent amount of maintenance so i set aside a couple hundred quid for that.

I then also looked at getting a new car. The finance rates through the dealers weren't great, as I'm a student i didn't want to commit to anything long term and the shorter term rates were astonishingly high. So I looked at leasing. I could get a 1.0l Fiesta Zetec S for about £150 a month over 2 years. There is a initial deposit of 6 months to be put down though. I couldn't make up my mind about which to do: invest in the old car which i more costly at first but would be cheaper over the long run; put a smaller investment into the new car and be guaranteed to have no extra costs but it would probably cost me more over the long run.

I decided to do a few calculations and included fuel costs for 10k miles, tax, insurance (20yo white male with no convictions or accidents), maintenance, etc. Over two years it would cost me almost £8,000 to have the Fiesta, whereas it would cost me about £8300 for the Civic. The insurance difference was about £1000 for the first year which definitely impacted the end results. The Fiesta also had no tax and maintenance costs, and was significantly better on fuel, getting over 60mpg. However, this doesn't include the fact that at the end of those two years you have to give the car back to the company. You can buy it off them, but for a fee. Whereas with the civic you still had a car, probably worth about £1200 or thereabouts, that you could sell.

In the end i opted for the Fiesta, the £900 difference spread over 2 years was worth it to me for the security of knowing i wouldn't have to fork over any extra cash for unexpected problems and also the convenience of the extra features like bluetooth and such. 

Just mentioned the leasing option as you said you have your income guaranteed for 2 years so if your circumstances changed then at least you won't have any contract to worry about.",0,1402775465,null,0,false,0,ci7khmc,t3_284qy4,t1_ci7khmc,t3_284qy4,null,1434239206,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

I love not going to work.  Working is shit, unless you happen to love the work you do (which BI still encourages people to do).  I hate having to spend most of my days doing shit work that could be automated.  I'd much rather spend time with my family or have the freedom to educate myself.

Freeing ourselves from the very basics, would allow the greatest minds to flourish and push us even further.

Knowing you don't have to worry about food or shelter allows you to find something to make you feel happy and fulfilled.

It's not because he has different views. It's because he attacks a whole group of people without showing a shred of evidence. Simple mathematics shows us that there hasn't been a spike in immigration that corresponds to the spike in hate crimes.

And yet, he basically painted a whole group with the ""they are the cause of the hate crimes"" brush. A little ironic, if you ask me.

true,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,"&gt; the approach of forcing random home-owners to tolerate rough sleeping on their private property

No-one is forcing homeless to sleep on your private property or anyone elses. There's no government mandate, no law, but the brutal and stark law of nature that says it's cold and windy at night and if one has no home then one must look for shelter in the nearest and most expedient place.

If you happen to live in an area where the local economy has made it such that (a) you have been successful enough to afford such a place and (b) a great percentage of the local population has fallen on the other side of the widening 'you' and the poor gap, then you have a very real and human problem that you and your local area need to work together to solve.

The RNLI is a volunteer organisation primarily staffed by local volunteers would you believe! When some stupid tourist from inland comes down to the coast for a holiday and gets trapped on a cliff or out at sea, the coastal people don't simply install spikes at the bottom of the cliff, or let the sea move the 'problem' away from them. They send out the RNLI and save that person - because it's a person - not a pigeon or a rat.

People who've fallen on hard times are similar to those people who fall off cliffs - they are in a position of vulnerability, with little experience, and they ultimately will not get out of the situation without the assistance of other humans within their proximity.

You can either agree that as human beings we have a duty to help others who through their own stupidity or misfortune have fallen down, or you can be intellectually consistent and call for the dismantling of organisations like the RNLI who actually do deal with problems on their doorstep.",1,1402777072,null,0,false,0,ci7l4qm,t3_284udt,t1_ci7l4qm,t1_ci7kfhm,null,1434239510,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For a lot of / most people, GCSEs are *hard* - remember this! There's a lot of media hype about how GCSEs are too easy, but if you're actually sitting them now, you will find them difficult! And this was before the linear exam days, I dread to think what it's going to be like from now on...

The good news is, for most people at least, your GCSEs only count towards getting through to college or A levels, and a lot of the time, this means a B will get you to where you need to be! Following on from this, contrary to what most teachers may have you think, GCSEs are not the be all and end all of your world! 

With a bit of luck, you're now finished - you can't do anything about your exams now, even if you wanted to, so you may as well sit back and relax - enjoy the good weather while it lasts!

If worst comes to worst and you completely bomb an exam, a lot of centres will negotiate with you (eg: ""You can do this course, but you'll have to resit this exam next year""). And, chances are, if you're doing the AS level equivalent of that subject for a year and go to retake the GCSE one, you'll do fine!

So in summary, chillax, the ordeal is probably over, sit back and hold tight for results day! In the meantime, enjoy! :)

Well, you'd need to increase taxes. But, you'll also have to pay out less in benefits, which currently pay out £2,500 per person.

&gt; People who promote basic income just don't get that in reality there isn't that much money going around.

That's not how money works. In a centralised economy, all the money that enters the system is just the flip side of debt; obligations to pay somebody else interest. You can create as much money as you want -- you just have to get the right balance between the public and business, so that everything functions as you want it to.

The ultimate point is that if we did have Basic Income, the value of money would change over time. £7,000 is a Basic Income world wouldn't be £7,000 in Today's world. As an individual, this means higher taxes and higher inflation. BUT, most of us would be better off because we are working not to survive, but to live a luxurious life.

I'm living in a one-bedroom flat in Gorgie, with my boyfriend. We split the 500-pound rent (which includes utilities) in half. I also am working at a grocery store part-time, and that pays for my half of rent, plus groceries.

We do a lot of our grocery shopping at Aldi. It's about 30 pounds altogether for us to get one week's shopping at Aldi.
People here mostly take the bus to get around. They've just put in a new tram system, which is cool, and you can use a Ridacard bus pass for them as well. If you do end up needing/wanting public transport, the Ridacard is 40 pounds a month - well worth it if you're taking the bus to school most days.

I saved up a bit working at Target before I came here - something like $1k. That lasted me about til about November/December. I had a bit of a rough time to begin with, getting used to the conversion rates - I spent a lot on snacks and other things I shouldn't have, because I thought they were great deals.

There are so many factors which come into play, after all. A child with a wealthy background has more opportunities, for example, and yet it's also their home environment (e.g. arguing parents) that could affect grades.

Ultimately, however, there's no excuse for not getting decent C grades in your school exams. Unless you're recognised as dyslexic or have a similar learning impediment, it's typically just laziness. There's this culture nowadays amongst youth and, as a student I see this quite a bit, that the world owes you something. 

I think that part of the solution lies in being harsh, as weird as that sounds. Schools praise pupils for getting D or C grades in a GCSE, when really I think they need to be more pushy. They need to be honest and tell them that, unless you're getting Cs and Bs at a minimum, you're going to struggle to even get a job in McDonalds.

1) The harvester isn't all that good but they do a really good sundae.

2) Woking is within walking distance if you have enough money for the cinema but not for the bus. 

3) Never take a back office job in the NHS because they'll only outsource you.

4) For the love of god meet people. There's a board gaming group that meets at a pub in Woking every Tuesday. Can't remember the name of the place. It's not far from the train station and serves real ale, I think it's a chain pub like a Weatherspoons, but not a Weatherspoons... Shit I remember the logo. It was a fireplace. Either way, people are pretty spread out in that part of Surrey so you might need to travel to meet people.

5) You are living near a lot of history. Go and see it.

6) London's further away than you think. If, like me, you detest that stinking rat hole of a capital, this is a good thing. If not, it might not be.

7) Weybridge train station is actually the hub of a lot of switches. This is useful. It's also further away from the main bus routes than is comfortable to walk unless you like factoring walking time into your travel arrangements (I do), this is irrelevant if you have a car. 

8) Don't go to Chertsey. It's not worth it.

9) Don't worry if you feel a burning desire to leave. That's natural.

I'm here for the full four years of my course, instead of just one semester, so I'm not positive it'll be the same for you. Definitely double check that though. BTW the minimum wage here is 6.31 pounds, assuming you're 21.

I got a job by applying like, everywhere I could think of. Especially supermarkets! I have an Associates' degree from community college, and Sainsburys seem interested in that. But definitely look all the time at supermarket recruiting websites, job centre websites, anywhere. I got an interview at 3 stores (applied to like 6) within the next month. Once you get something, it's an amazing way to get accustomed to the Scottish people and the accents (!!!), the currency, and if at a grocery store, the food!

The first few months we went (and ate) out a lot. A lot of it was take-out food and restaurants. For normal weeks, we try not to have take-outs more than once a week - even better if we only get one day. It's a bit easier cause it's for two people. When going out to bars and clubs, I'm really a lightweight, and I can only handle 2-3 drinks in a few hours. Some of my friends here can spend 200 pounds in a night (which is craaazy), but I'm okay to spend less than 20 in a night out. Some clubs have drinks starting at like 1.50 pounds. Depends where you go!

You can find lots of cool tours around Scotland, if that's the way you want to go. We've been on a Loch Ness with Haggis-Adventures for 42 pounds each, and that took us all around the country. But if you're just looking to explore the Edinburgh area, the buses go everyyywhere. For example, the Britannia yacht (a big American tourist attraction) is in a nice shopping center that buses go straight to.

true,interfail,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Hegemonic technically means something like ""of the ruling class"", which I assume is what you got from looking it up. In this context, however, it would imply something more like ""divide and conquer"". It means the man on the street being angry not because Vodafone paid no tax, but because they're not totally convinced the guy down the street's bad leg really stops him from working, or who are on the waiting list for a council flat even though some of them have Polish people living in them.

&gt;That's a similar situation for most people. It's not about class (which most people working to get by simply do not care about in the slightest), but more about attitude.
&gt;But there's not much all of us peasants can do with regards to how the elite / ruling class view average people. Because those kind of people view the under class, working class and middle class in the same boat, I imagine.

This is what's important. It's not just about what Cameron's lot in the 0.1% think. The boat is the same, no matter how educated the people in it are. You look at the scumbag absentee father over the road and say ""well, he's a chav"", the same way that half the population looks at your entire street. You think it is about attitude because that is who you've been taught (or learned) to look down upon. For those from the politically relevant social strata, however, it is about wealth as proxy for 'attitude', and they look at you as part of the problem. Sure, by the sounds of it you're our kind of poor guy, all plucky and eloquent, but when it comes to political responses to social issues, you're seen exactly the same as that deadbeat chav over the road, and you can be trusted to vote against him.",1,1402787681,null,0,false,0,ci7p6p0,t3_2857jf,t1_ci7p6p0,t1_ci7o9x4,null,1434241486,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Once they agree to change the locks, tell them you also want an additional lock on the door, or a security light or something. Doesn't matter if they agree to do it or not, the point is to not make any concessions and to make them think it will be more trouble fobbing you off than it is worth.

Watch out, though: Anglia, in their management buy-out days, reintroduced through services from London to Lowestoft along the East Suffolk line. At a stroke, almost all services became London ones. They also helped to put a passing loop in place, to improve service on the line after singling in the 1980s.

National Express take over the new franchise, and suddenly none of this is important. The concept of through trains was rejected, and the ""improved reliability"" of connections was the selling point. Back to the local services, square one, but the completion of the passing loop made it possible for them to plug a 'new' 'improved' service.

So many lines have similar stories to tell: there's dozens for every one which makes the national news.

Nobody is in any doubt that the WCML is reaching capacity.

But then people that need benefits wouldn't have them. What about people that are on housing benefit, or the disabled? Are they exempt? In which case you've barely saved any money at all.

&gt;That's not how money works. In a centralised economy, all the money that enters the system is just the flip side of debt; obligations to pay somebody else interest. You can create as much money as you want -- you just have to get the right balance between the public and business, so that everything functions as you want it to.

Your second point nullifies your first. The fundimental rule still remains that there is a limited amount of goods and services at anyone time and you cant just conjure more. Hopefully they will be more in the future but you can't just say ""You can create as much money as you want"". Only so many apples are harvested, so many cars rolled off the production line, there are on only so many hours someone is willing to cut hair. You can't just wish for more. It's a scarcity problem and all you can really do at the end of the day is redistribute and there isn't that much to redistribute

&gt;The ultimate point is that if we did have Basic Income, the value of money would change over time. £7,000 is a Basic Income world wouldn't be £7,000 in Today's world. As an individual, this means higher taxes and higher inflation. BUT, most of us would be better off because we are working not to survive, but to live a luxurious life. In this world, being rich doesn't matter so much. And that's a world we have to move to if we want to work less, and let robots do most of the work for us.

It doesn't sound like we'd need any less money than we do now in this work-lite economy. I recon people will still want to own their home, own a car, go on holiday, go out for dinner, etc. Heck, people still like to have enough to eat and warm their home.

Until the basic income crowd can give me solid maths that we actually have money to give each adult a decent amount of money without putting huge cuts into public services and benefits or destroying the economy. I'm not sold on it. Income distribution is a problem that has already been solved in other countries. It's easy, you tax rich people and give poor people benefits. There are economics hits associated with that and you have to account for them but it's doable.

You do sound a bit weird, but you don't sound Russian, your grammatical mistakes and slower speech give you away more than mispronunciation, try and relax it and make it sound more natural, not a bad attempt.

true,TechJesus,null,null,"&gt; That's not how money works. In a centralised economy, all the money that enters the system is just the flip side of debt; obligations to pay somebody else interest. You can create as much money as you want -- you just have to get the right balance between the public and business, so that everything functions as you want it to.

As someone else has pointed out, you seem to have forgotten that money isn't some sort of magical artefact, it is a conduit for goods and services. You can increase the supply of money easily, but increasing the supply of goods and services is much harder – especially when innovation often proves so costly.

&gt; As an individual, this means higher taxes and higher inflation. BUT, most of us would be better off because we are working not to survive, but to live a luxurious life. In this world, being rich doesn't matter so much. And that's a world we have to move to if we want to work less, and let robots do most of the work for us.

I don't really see what you'd tax if you are creating an economy where by definition fewer are producing.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"Nowhere on this page have I said that faith schools should be banned, but I do think they're bad for society.

So, what's the argument for faith schools?  That they sometimes produce good academic results?  Well, that's because they get to be choosy with their student intake.  It's not because religion motivates children to do well - or at least I'm not aware of any evidence showing that.

But, academic success aside, these schools are at the very least causing segregation of children according to their parents' religion, which I think is bad for society.    I also find it immoral that these schools, no matter how subtly, will attempt to indoctrinate children into religion, when children cannot consent to indoctrination.

Finally, there's the little matter that schools are meant to teach objective truth and religion is anything but.  No matter what faith you belong to, there is precisely zero evidence that your religious beliefs are actually true!  I know it's considered rude to say this, but God/Allah doesn't actually exist any more than the tooth fairy.  It's no more sensible having your children learn about Christian/Muslim/Jewish theology then it is to have the teachers instruct them in astrology or palm-reading.

true,Poison1990,cnty-wales,Wales,"The argument for faith schools is - they already exist - on average kids who go to faith schools do better than kids at non-faith schools - the 'bad' aspects (depending on your perspective) have yet to outweigh the benefits.

I think it's totally unfair to say that these schools are causing segregation. Maybe for the minority religion faith schools (Islamic and Jewish schools) - but certainly not for the Christian ones. The kids at Christian faith schools are just as secular as everyone else in the UK.

Do you find it immoral because you just don't like religion? or immoral because you think indoctrination is immoral? I know I'm going to pass on my values to my children, I don't think it's a problem for others to do the same. Children can't consent to indoctrination but they can (and do) say ""this is bullshit"" if they disagree with something. No one is going to punish them for not being Christian.

&gt; schools are meant to teach objective truth and religion is anything but.

You're right - religion is subjective truth. You'll find that not all questions have a 'true' or 'false' answer. Ethics and philosophy deal with these questions, and that's the main focus of religion. If you can't appreciate the value of ethics, philosophy, and theology simply because they don't deal with objective reality then that's your loss.

&gt; It's no more sensible having your children learn about Christian/Muslim/Jewish theology then it is to have the teachers instruct them in astrology or palm-reading.

I think that's apples and oranges. Theology is an incredibly broad and diverse subject - whereas astrology and palm reading are more specific.

I know I would say this (as a theology graduate) but I'm glad Religious Studies is compulsory (short course at least). I think it's beneficial to learn about other peoples culture, philosophies, and religion because it can give you an awareness of your own subjectivity, critical thinking skills, and teaches you how to discuss, debate, and not get offended by different points of view. Just because you're not religious doesn't make it any less interesting. Better than learning about oxbow lakes surly?

true,illiterateninja,lfc99,,"I thought Hendo did a decent job until he got subbed out, albeit a little bit quiet except for his shot from outside the box. Sterling and Sturridge were definitely the ones trying to make plays, even if Glenn gave the ball away a couple of times. He also had some great tries at getting the ball into the box, unfortunately it seemed like people were rarely there to receive. Stevie was also really quiet during the first half and didn't really come out until the second. I still think he should have gotten a penalty, but whatever. 
 
One of the biggest problems I saw was the complete lack of press. This is, in my mind, bigger than lazy Wayne and clueless Jack. This is something that Hendo excels at and is the major way that we control the high line and midfield, yet Roy seems content to just let the Italians pass and run right into the box.

true,beejiu,eng-essex,Essex,"&gt; But then people that need benefits wouldn't have them. What about people that are on housing benefit, or the disabled? Are they exempt? In which case you've barely saved any money at all.

With true basic income, nobody would need benefits because the Basic Income would pay for a basic life. Obviously, the disabled would need a bit more.

&gt; Hopefully they will be more in the future but you can't just say ""You can create as much money as you want"".

You literally can. That's how money is created in the first instance. The value of everything else in life just changes. Supply-and-demand still holds -- if there's more demand for those apples, the price goes up (I made the comment about price inflation.)

&gt; I recon people will still want to own their home, own a car, go on holiday, go out for dinner, etc.

Of course they would. But, with Basic Income, they do not have to work 40 hour weeks to have those luxuries. In a more efficient economy, a full time job would be 15-20 hours per week. This is the sort of time we'll have to work if we are to embrace automation. Otherwise, there will not be enough jobs to go around.

&gt; It's easy, you tax rich people and give poor people benefits.

Unfortunately, that destroys incentive to work and creates a poverty trap. In some ways, it causes the problems it is trying to solve.

&gt; I just don't get why basic income is seen as anything better apart from the fact that it's a benefit everyone gets.

Because if there are only enough full time jobs for 50% of people, the current system doesn't work. This is the only attractive benefit of Basic Income -- that it encourages everybody to work less so that work is more fairly distributed.",0,1402814295,null,0,false,0,ci7y5b7,t3_2857jf,t1_ci7y5b7,t1_ci7pxjv,null,1434245827,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You only need to change the supply of goods, if the demand has actually changed. NOT if the value of money has changed. Ultimately, it doesn't matter to an Apple producer if his apples sell for 10p or 20p. All that matters is achieving the optimal price.

You should recognise that a move to Basic Income is not something that will happen overnight. 

&gt; I don't really see what you'd tax if you are creating an economy where by definition fewer are producing.

No, we'd be producing more. I'm talking about when we have fully embraced automation and robots to do much of the production for us.

While true, the reasons (or part of the reasons) are obviously down to the fact that in many cases not just any kid can join them. The schools can be selective. 

I know of one family who essentially converted to get their son into a school. The fact some have to take this sort of action says a lot about their dedication as well as thier child's.

he brought in players like anelka dirt cheap and sold them for fortunes because of who they became under his tutelage.

the animosity started to come only after the new stadium dictated we had to sell players PREMATURELY and then the money that made teams like chelsea also saw our players leaving prematurely because their heads were turned by money.

then there are people like adebayor and nasri who were turned by money and got some stick for it, rightly so. 

how would you guys be if you made a player the player they are today only to see them depart to one of your biggest rivals for more cash, and to top it off you couldnt directly replace them, but had to nurture and new talent instead.

then we have the rebuilding projects...ie, the team built entirely around cesc only for him to be lured back to barca and then his replacement...nasri..2 weeks later moves to city because his head is turned purely by money.

another reason for the sentiment lacking from chelsea fans is the fact chelsea didnt really exist until 2003 and since then has been a merry go round of players coming and going. no one really makes their name at chelsea, chelsea buys names and they usually sell when they want rather than have players push for a move because of money.

true,rhiscott21,null,null,"I'm a legal adviser specialising in housing law.

Yes, you're completely correct that upon the expiry of the initial fixed term of your tenancy, it becomes a statutory periodic tenancy, commonly known as a 'rolling contract'. If you want to reference legislation to the agents, then technically, it's Section 5 (2) of the Housing Act 1988, but I'd recommend you don't bother- there have been various amendments to the legislation since then and I can guarantee that there isn't an agent out there who isn't aware of the above. It's bread and butter tenancy law. 

If you refuse to sign a new tenancy agreement as agreed, then yes, your landlord's only option if he didn't concede and just allow you to remain would be to serve you with a Section 21 notice seeking possession under the Housing Act 1988. There was some recent case law (Spencer v Taylor 2013) that has dramatically changed what this notice must include to be valid, and now, all your landlord must show is that he has given you at least two month's notice in writing of his intention to seek possession of your accommodation. This notice cannot be backdated, and MUST be in writing, the two most common invalid notice issues I see.

Upon the expiry of the two month's NSP, you would still have a legal right to occupy the property, and your landlord would have to apply for a possession order at the local county court. Providing he has completed the paperwork correctly and you do not have any other defence (in your case, all this could be is that he has failed to protect a deposit paid as required by S. 213 of the Housing Act 2004) then the District Judge would award an Outright Order for Possession, which would almost certainly only give you a further 14 days to remain, though you can request up to 42 on the grounds of exceptional circumstances for the D. Judge to consider. It's hard to get additional time. 

Even then, you still have a legal right to occupy and your landlord would then have to apply to court for a Warrant of Possession, more commonly known as a bailiff's warrant. You will get roughly 7 days notice of this and on the day of its expiry, court bailiff's will attend your property to ensure that you have vacated, and will change the locks.

Depending on where you live, how smart your landlord is, and how busy your local County Court is, the entire above process will take a minimum of three months, it's usually longer. However, you must be aware that all court costs will be awarded to you, and if you do not pay them within the court ordered time (again, usually fourteen days) you will get a County Court Judgement against your name which will bugger your credit rating. 

Costs have just gone up again this April, and you will have to pay £250 plus any reasonable legal costs (solicitor's fees etc). The District Judge decides what's reasonable. 

A Warrant of Possession costs £110.

At any point within a statutory periodic tenancy, you can, as advised by your agency, submit one month's written  notice of your intention to vacate your accommodation. You should try and time this so that the notice expires on the last day of your rental period, so that you're not considered to owe rent after you've actually vacated. 

Landlord's hate going through the above process, and if you want to leave in a few months anyway, my suggestion would be to negotiate with your landlord directly and ask that he does not initiate possession proceedings on the commitment that you will shortly be vacating, having submitted to him written confirmation of this by way of one month's notice. 

Hope this helps. If you do need any further advice, let me know. ",0,1402818400,null,0,false,0,ci7z046,t3_285j22,t1_ci7z046,t3_285j22,null,1434246177,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,polo5353,null,null,"I really do feel for the Liverpool boys. There has been heaps of expectation on them; ""Liverpool had a fantastic season therefore England will thrive from them playing"", ""Liverpool players will boost the team"" etc. This is all true, but the fact of the matter is they have to be able to express themselves as Rodgers allowed them to for us. Raheem and Studge were given a certain amount of freedom but Hendo and Stevie G were just told to sit and defend. The whole ethic of the Liverpool team is to flow freely through midfield and allow the midfield to link up, the likes of Henderson bombing forward, which I only saw in the first few minutes with that well saved shot. 

I thought Raheem and Sturridge were very impressive and really did drag us back into the game. Johnson for all the criticism he has and will receive gave us a constant outlet, something Darmian did for them. The difference; when they saw Johnson/Baines out of position they hit it quick, we meandered around the park and let them set. Something I put down solely to Woy.

Credit where credit is due, I though Welbeck had a good game which is something I did NOT see myself saying beforehand. If he can be a bit more positive on the ball, I don't have an issue with him starting the next game. Rooney, don't even get me started. It was clear that all he had on his mind was scoring, whether by hook or by crook. You could see the pressure on him, from missing that golden chance in the second half, sulking about having to track back, to taking the ball of Barkley and firing miles over. I wouldn't be unhappy to see him dropped!

For the next game, I would be interested to see us play with an extra midfield man. Go 4-3-3 and have Sterling and Welbeck on the wings. The Italians played around us so well with a similar formation. Have Hendo and Stevie G sitting with Wilshere just in front. When in attack, Wilshere becomes Marchisio, a free roaming player. When on the defensive he becomes Verrati, a solid midfield player who can play himself out of trouble. 

I would honestly be really unimpressed if we start Rooney against Uruguay, he really didn't do anything to justify it bar the cross for Studge's goal. I would love to see us have that extra man in midfield like Italy did against us. If Woy is intent on playing slow possession football, at least setup in a manner that let's us do it. 

I can still see us getting out the group, but we need to step up against Uruguay. Woy needs to be bold, picking Sterling last night cannot be deemed bold, he was the best English winger in England by a mile last season. He needs, in my humble opinion, to drop Rooney and let the England team play at a higher pace.

In short:

&gt; The visitor centre was built in 2011 with the aid of a £5m lottery grant as well a further £3m in matched funds, raised by the Bletchley Park Trust. This money secured the future of the site and helped to restore the decaying huts in which many of the codebreakers worked.

&gt; But it also opens with some six foot-high fences – separating two museums which each claim the legacy of Bletchley – which have been described as a Berlin Wall and symbolise an ugly, long-running dispute with Bletchley Park's neighbour and tenant, the National Museum of Computing (TNMOC).

&gt; The trust claims that the fences and gates are to improve safety for pedestrians by removing some car parking. The museum says visitors have to walk twice as far to reach them, and that the Trust doesn't explain that the working rebuild of Colossus – the world's first programmable digital electronic computer and key codebreaking engine – is on site [see footnote].",0,1402829147,null,0,false,0,ci80om9,t3_2849fh,t1_ci80om9,t1_ci7a3hg,null,1434246989,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Anyway, I quite liked this comment:

&gt; A lot of criticisms on here regarding Britishness and immigration. But the identity of Britishness is far more complex than that. A lot of British people consider themselves Christian, whereas many British people can't stand religion. Some are fascist, some not fascist etc. I think we try and be too simplistic about what Britishness is. Any country should aspire simply for freedom and free speech.

When people talk about 'Britishness', quite often you see them talking about the Magna Carta, and the Bill of Rights, and our political freedoms that came from that. Then, in the next sentence, they'll talk about wanting to ban things that are different, and complain about people who don't believe in freedom of speech and political freedoms. Surely if you support freedom of speech, you support people using it for views that oppose yours, or that are different to yours?

Henderson - Probably our third best player before he came off, was helping to control the middle and was putting in a great shift. Came off for Wilshire which was a horrid move because he did nothing but run into Italians. 


Sterling best England player on the pitch by some way for most of the game, got forced out wide to accommodate Rooney in the second half and faded a little though.

&gt;It is inevitable that events in Mosul have led to a re-run of the arguments over the decision to remove Saddam Hussein in 2003. The key question obviously is what to do now. But because some of the commentary has gone immediately to claim that but for that decision, Iraq would not be facing this challenge; or even more extraordinary, implying that but for the decision, the Middle East would be at peace right now; it is necessary that certain points are made forcefully before putting forward a solution to what is happening now.

This reads to me simply that we cannot be sure that the Iraq Invasion was the direct cause of what's happening now, because so many other more major destabilising factors have occurred as well, that it's just wheeling out the simple solution but ignoring the reality of the situation.

&gt;The reality is that the whole of the Middle East and beyond is going through a huge, agonising and protracted transition. We have to liberate ourselves from the notion that ‘we’ have caused this. We haven't. We can argue as to whether our policies at points have helped or not; and whether action or inaction is the best policy and there is a lot to be said on both sides. But the fundamental cause of the crisis lies within the region not outside it.

He doesn't say nor imply he's surprised at what has happened in Iraq, and doesn't shy away from saying we may have made things worse (or may have made them better).

You might have learnt fractional reserve banking in Economics 101, but Endogenous Money Theory is the theory that more accurately describes how the banking system works. [The UK does not have a reserve ratio](http://www.positivemoney.org/faqs/arent-you-just-talking-about-the-money-multiplier-model-of-money-creation/), and if you understand Endogenous Money Theory you will understand that [a reserve ratio would not achieve much in constraining lending] (http://www.positivemoney.org/faqs/dont-liquidity-requirements-reserve-ratios-limit-the-money-supply/).

You are also wrong about borrowing being used to expand business etc... Loans from banks are the creation of ""new"" money which is created by a private corporation for private profit. A[round 9-13% of these loans goes to expand businesses] (http://www.positivemoney.org/faqs/if-bank-can-create-money-then-why-arent-they-giving-loans-to-businesses/), infrastructure or anything in the real economy that you mention.

The vast majority goes into the financial sector, which increases the value of stocks, shares or assets and does not create anything of real value in the economy. 

Borrowing to invest in the things you have mentioned is great, I have no problem with it. [But the vast amount of new money/debt is not used in the ""real"" economy](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jennyjones/100275978/too-many-banks-are-socially-useless-time-to-bring-back-captain-mainwaring/).

When marching out the ""Loans help people buy houses"" mantra, you have to understand that loans are new money that is created out of thin air. One of the biggest reasons why housing prices are so high is banks have created new money and stuffed it into houses. The asset price goes up meaning fewer and fewer people can afford to buy a home, or they have to get a bigger and bigger loan which creates new money to further inflate the already overpriced asset. House prices are a function of supply and demand for houses AND supply of money (which is almost infinite as banks create money out of nothing). It is a Ponzi Scheme and sometimes it goes belly up as we saw in the USA.

The fact is it does vary from week to week and day to day, and it's not unique to where I work either. You either have lots of redundant overhead staffing to compensate for this issue or you pay good people good wages so when they have to work harder they do.

Imagine a few scenarios:

* software developer has deadline for next week, really needs to push hard with team to meet deadline and they work longer hours
* solicitor has an important case the next day so works longer
* trainee accountant preparing someone's end of year accounts and revising for exam, will work late to make sure it's done
* teacher marking exams and doing lesson plans during exam season having to work late at home to make sure everything's done

obviously, if every single week you are working for 'free' then it sucks (even though some people I know do it). But in most professional and semi-professional jobs people are keen to make a good impression and be judged on the standard of their work, so when times are trying, will actually put in extra hours to ensure the standard remains high. Salaried contracts generally reflect this by saying that the hours are not necessarily fixed, and often 'time off in lieu' is promised (but not always delivered). I knew a few teachers a few years ago who all had between 50-100 hours 'banked' to take off in lieu but obviously you can't carry over to the next year - but because of the intense schedule they were going to lose it most likely.

Also finally, in most organisations with skilled individuals, if they're worth their salt, targets are set at so called 'stretch' levels which means they're not necessarily expected to be met by doing the casual 9-5, but are there to stretch you and reflect the fact that every day you do your job, you should be getting better at it.

So instead of buying a sharpener I decided to depot my pencil into a small container.

This is a very simple way of depotting the pencils and only requires a few tools that you will probably have lying around the house. It only takes around 5 minutes to achieve and once you are finished depotting you will have a nice container full of product you can either use clean fingers or a brush to apply. This is also in my opinion more sanitary than using the pencils directly onto the eyelid, as you can make sure your hands are clean before dipping your finger into the product, or even using a brush that you can also clean with each use.

I'm not going to change my point, which is pretty obvious already. You didn't hesitate making fun of my English language, even though you probably had a very good idea I'm a foreigner and that side comment was only meant to do a personal attack, rather than add anything into discussion.

&gt;Pllleaaaasee don't tell me that you're basing this on UCAS entry levels. It means nothing.

Of course UCAS only relates to pre-university standards.

&gt;How the UK could hire from the best without having to adopt the worst. Or why there is a need to cream off the top, if we can.

No, my point still stands and it clearly shows that your whole argument of ""the best"" is not real, as UK import people from countries which have very low education standards and they don't even understand medical establishments in those countries, hence the report I've linked you to (surprised it wasn't done before and to all countries, where they import medical staff).

Also, if you look in details you will see that those differences in position actually show very small differences in overall score.

&gt;Of the developed Western world we have the second strictest gun laws behind Japan. That was before the Blair additions.

Good. Maybe that's the reason gun related crime is so low. I know they have some point in the US to have guns for self defence, but the way they're doing it is clearly mobbed by gun manufacturers.

&gt;Highish standards mashing together with lowish expectations doesn't work so well.

Doesn't matter, his comment was kind of racist and every sane person would realise that. Why Mr Farage isn't making comments like that regarding migrants from Africa? I've looked a while ago into statistics and it's clear there is something..... but obviously it shouldn't be resolved by pointing fingers and saying you are bad because you come from a bad country. You, defending Farage with this proves my point of not being objective.

&gt;That, which I cited, was the rest of the paragraph. It doesn't make any sense.

Well, I've thought it's enough I tell you I can and you can rely on it.

This is where you are going wrong. Your viewpoint of the internet is that it's original authors who control the information. They don't. Once a news article is posted it is disseminated and stored around the world. This is a growing trend which is only going to keep on growing. All the big search giants are holding this data, there are lots of independent projects setup which store and hold internet archive data.

And the difference with this data is that it's fresh. It's live, news breaks on the internet these days. It's not stuck on some editors desk over the weekend. Plus it includes individuals comments and opinions in a way never before seen.

*  On 18 May 2013, just as the bill to legalize same-sex marriages was being prepared to pass into law, over 400 leading Muslims including head teachers and senior representatives of mosques across the country, published an open letter opposing the bill on the grounds that ""Muslim parents will be robbed of their right to raise their children according to their beliefs, as gay relationships are taught as something normal to their primary-aged children"".

I hate this whitewashing that occurs in an apparent attempt to demonise anyone who dares to criticise Muslims.  They are not a race.  They are just people who really like a particular book.

Now, all of these groups is funded by foreign money with a sole purpose - to cause chaos in that region where they operate. There's no religious element to that groups any more except they use it to justify their actions.

Highest adherence rate isn't bad thing. It shows that more people are inclined to follow Islam for whatever reason.

Only because any kind of relationships without marriage is forbidden in Islam.

This occurs because, in Islam, there is nobody who has higher authority than average Muslim. It has no hierarchy structure. For example, basically anyone who's remotely knowledgeable in Islam can issue Fatwa. The only thing that matters is if anyone listens to the fatwa. If nobody listens to the fatwa, then what's the point of issuing fatwa? That's what happens if there is no hierarchy structure.

They will try to get us to forget that the rich have got richer while the poor have suffered utility bills rises way above inflation while getting pay rises less than inflation, they will try to get us to forget that food banks are now commonplace in the uk.

It's a scary thing. And the high adherence rate is because giving up your religion is a sin, marrying a non-Muslim is a sin and Islam is isolationist too so it keeps people trapped. It doesn't let followers socialise freely with others, doesn't let them drink alcohol, eat at the same (non-halal) restaurants and so it keeps people trapped within the small circle of followers.

I'm not posing as a PF guru. This is basic stuff. The additional return you get (on average) from stocks compared to a cash deposit is known as the ""risk premium"", because it's the reward for taking additional risk. Stocks can fall in price substantially in fairly small amounts of time, even if they have a history of maintaining their price, and an ""emergency fund"" is something you want there reliably, not something that may have temporarily halved in value just when you need it.

Now, if you have enough money there is an argument that if you have a significant multiple (at least double, ideally more like three to four times) of your required/desired ""emergency"" fund in highly diversified stock investments, then you could consider this an alternative to an emergency fund, as it's unlikely that a highly diversified investment would fall *that* much. (You'd be incurring the risk of possibly having to liquidate investments at a low point, but gaining the additional average return on what would otherwise be an emergency fund.)

This case is unique as this happened recently. It had a lot of people from aboard coming in to 'help'. There's actually a lot of Imams in the mosques condemning it. Vast majority of people know it's wrong. Even though there's many people condemning it, there's will be always a few who slips through net because they feel they don't agree with whatever people is saying around them. Again, this happens because there's no hierarchy in the religion.

&gt;the high adherence rate is because giving up your religion is a sin

And how exactly do you determine this from? If one truly does not believe in Islam, why do sinning by leaving religion matter to them?

&gt;marrying a non-Muslim is a sin

And..? Marrying someone with views radically different to you is not good idea.

&gt;Islam is isolationist 

Actually no. Islam as a religion, is open to anyone who feels they believe in it. There are some other religions that are even more isolationist than Islam such as Judaism.

&gt;It doesn't let followers socialise freely with others

Define ""socialise freely"". If I think what you think it means, then I'm going to say it's not true.

&gt;let them drink alcohol

And, how is that a bad thing? Cigarettes even can be considered as *haraam* in Islam. The reasoning for this is that they are harmful. Their benefits do not outweigh harm it causes.

&gt;eat at the same (non-halal) restaurants 

Blatantly untrue. Muslims only avoid non-halal restaurants because they are not sure if they avoid contamination well enough and also because some of them want to eat meats which they cannot do in a non-halal restaurants. If a Muslim wants to eat a vegetarian food and they are sure it won't be contaminated, they can eat at non-halal restaurants if they want.

&gt;Plus the cultural aspects like arranged/forced marriages and a close family who will disown you if you quit the religion.

Forced marriage is forbidden in Islam, simple as that. Culture does not take priority over Islam.

Actually, there's many cases of people reverting to Islam and getting disowned by their family in USA, and some other countries. This is 100% cultural problem. I urge you not to confuse Islam with culture.

&gt;And a worrying amount seem to follow.

In reality, this type of follower is absolutely tiny. Muslim community regularly takes action against on those type of followers, and most of it doesn't make it the news such as Anjem Choudary getting banned from most of Mosques in area where he regularly preaches.

The WBA role is similar to what Wolves was a couple years ago, there will be no real way to do well there unless the club dramatically changes it spending habits and allows the manager to spend some money to at least fill out the squad with PL capable players. 

By passing on the role Tim saved himself from being sacked by Christmas when there is a very good chance that WBA sack whoever the manager is to ""right the ship"". Tim will be given a chance by someone in England and by not taking the WBA role amazingly enough he is probably in a position to land a better job.",0,1402844908,null,0,false,0,ci8447y,t3_2873kx,t1_ci8447y,t1_ci82mcl,null,1434248653,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

Gadaffi also wanted to drop the petrodollar and replace that with the [gold dinar](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-gold-dinar-saving-the-world-economy-from-gaddafi/24639), Syria doesn't use the petrodollar and neither does Iran.

There seems to be a pattern between the countries moving away from US currency and countries that have recently been 'liberated' (Iraq and Libya) overrun with rebels (ISIS in Syria) or ostracised (Iran)

If the world were to move away from the petrodollar, that's going to make things economically uncomfortable for the US, and by extension us.

1. Taqiyya claims in that website is unsourced. There's no such as Taqiyya in Sunni Islam. Only one case where lying is allowed in Sunni Islam is when one's life is at risk because of their religion but then, almost everything in Islam is allowed if one's life is at risk including eating non-halal food, etc. [Here's better source on this.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taqiyya#Sunni_Islam_view)

As far as I know, Taqiyya is shia thing, and I know nothing much about shia Islam, so I'll let someone else to debate with you on that.

So, in this case, calling it a 'military jihad' is false.

Again, nobody has higher authority than other Muslims in terms of Islam. Muslims can choose to ignore a fatwa coming from someone if they do not agree with it. They can also ignore calls for war.

If a Muslim were to stand before Allah in the Day of Judgement, the Muslim wouldn't be given a 'bad merits' for ignoring calls for something from someone if they have valid reason for it.

Well you've clearly taken a position of your own which looks to be just as biased as anyone you would argue against. Casting the aspersion that mens rights groups have far more nut job ideas than feminists (do you have numbers to back that up?). The MRAs are, constantly, under very close inspection, it seems only logical that they would attempt to do the same to others.

&gt;Jihad is when your muslim boss tells you to go to kill infidels there is nothing more to discuss, you don't go, you are dead. 

There's no such thing as 'Muslim boss' as there is no hierarchy in Islam.

&gt;so you didn't answer me - do you support sharia? killing apostates, and adulterers? Because you have only two choices - 1) you support and by UK laws you are a criminal and terrorist 2) you don't support and you are NOT A MUSLIM?

My point is that most people when asked to give a reason for the rise of fascism in the early 20th century will point first and foremost to this proximate cause. This is dangerous because it ignores the real, ultimate reason why fascism gains a foothold - because it is appeals deeply to ordinary, intelligent people in a way that other political philosophies do not. Saying that fascism is a possible outcome of economic turmoil is like saying cold weather causes the common cold - yes, it can be a proximate cause of the symptoms, but it totally ignores the actual cause.
