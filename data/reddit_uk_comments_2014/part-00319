&gt;Can't help but notice increasingly, a lot 'political' comedians cracking cheap and easy gags about UKIP, to the extent that it's got hack, boring and lazy very quickly.

&gt;Particularly too much moronic, liberal back-slapping on panel shows like Mock The Week where aging, balding, fat men, ethnic comedians and women-posing-as-comedians, sit congratulating themselves on how enlightened they are about the fact that UKIP are ridiculous and pathetic.

&gt;Yet the Clacton by-election victory and what looks to be a likely victory in the Rochester by-election goes to show that UKIP have their supporters.

&gt;Out of touch, smug, superannuated, overpaid TV comics with their cosy lives in their west-London ivory towers taking a supercilious, moralising tone, pandering to the ever-creeping militant political correctness of the BBC with their frankly surreal diversity targets.

&gt;The reason UKIP have resonated with voters is because all the other parties are too spineless to tackle the issue of immigration.

&gt;Our elected representatives seeded control of the borders of this country to the EU and it's been catastrophic for us all, an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works. Public transport infrastructure is dysfunctional. Hospitals and Schools are dysfunctional. The housing crisis continues to blight our economic potential and destroy the hopes and dreams of a generation. The benefits system is totally out of control. All because there are far,far too many people living here.

&gt;For every wonderful, welcome skilled worker our open borders bring into this country, there are also benefit tourists and criminals. For every person that comes here and contributes richly to our culture, there are those that refuse to assimilate, which breeds distrust and has led to a fractured, broken society, where people have lost all sense of community.

&gt;Can't say that I'm a UKIP supporter, but I can see why other people are, and I don't disrespect them for it.

&gt;What I don't respect is lazy comedians, who market themselves as 'political' but rather than having the courage of their own convictions jump on the militant liberal bandwagon- which has been the source of so much shit stand-up over the years- so that they can get TV work and line their own pockets.

&gt;There is a deeply ingrained militant liberal politics at every level of the BBC, despite the fact that it's tax-payer funded and supposed to be neutral. It's a biased organisation and the only sorts of political comedians that are welcome within its corridors are those that reflect it's values.

&gt;Essentially when we're watching these 'political' comedians cracking their piss-poor UKIP gags on the BBC, I think we need to be aware they are neither engaged nor passionate about their subject- but money-grubbing charlatans, toadying up to the militant liberals that pay their wages, mirroring their own beliefs back at them in an act of false flattery so that they'll feel smug and validated and keep them on the BBC tax-payer funded gravy-train.

&gt;I'm not a political comic, my only ambition for my comedy is to make a room full of people laugh. But there are those that disingenuously market themselves as political comics, not out of any genuine conviction, but in an effort to line their own pockets, and I don't like their hypocrisy.

Here's what Adel Taarabt has to say about him. It's a bit recent and not at Spurs, but it lines up with what everyone else has said about him:

&gt;""âHe spends most of the time in his office but when he gets off the phone he comes down to watch for five or 10 minutes - he never takes a session,â revealed Taarabt. âThatâs when he said he had it in mind to start me against Liverpool.â""

""Fuckin' run around a bit"" seems to be Redknapp's philosophy. It's easy to say that to Bale, Modric and VdV. Not so easy when there are strikers short of confidence and the midfielders aren't anywhere near those threes' level. 

&gt;British managers often have a better understanding of our game. 

If that's the case, why have Mourinho, Pelligrini, Mancini, Ancellotti, (almost) Benitez and Wenger won or have come close to winning the league. Sorry, but ""our game"" is really an elevated opinion of English football that's followed by ""best league in the world"". It just might be, but foreign managers help make it so, not actively deter that.

That's fine if he went for him for that reason, IMO. There's probably a reason that Poch was in vogue to begin with in the first place, and that was because Southampton played lovely football. Same with Martinez and Rodgers, but I'll admit that they were more proven in the league.

I would have taken Rodgers to Spurs. He wanted to come but of course said no because he wasn't willing to work with a short-sighted chairman like Levy.

If we could attract a world class coach like Mourinho or Ancellotti then I would certainly want them to take over but hiring foreign managers just because their stock is high just sets the club back.

Sounds like you could use some, judging by your toxic way of arguing. Instead of being dynamic as the discussion develops, you hang up on one detail and ignore the rest. Reminds me of Danny :p

&gt; LOL. His attitude of prioritising the kids is illogical? Again, you're struggling to separate attitude and actions. You can criticise his actions, but not his attitude.

Neither you nor I are mindreaders, so we judge both Clara's and Danny's attitudes by their actions, as attitude shines through a person's actions. In this context actions and attitudes are highly relevant to each other. Did he *mean* well? Maybe, I don't care. The outcome and behavior is what I am judging. 

&gt; I'll break this down simply for you, we'll get to the crux of the issue.

Okay, clean slate. 

&gt; I call Clara out for not prioritising the kids' welfare. **You defend Clara for not prioritising the kids' welfare**, and attack Danny for doing so

Wrong, I defend Clara's actions as just right, as I disagree she showed enough negligence about the kids to be called out on it. Considering kids were fine, Clara focused on solving the bigger issue at hand that threatened them all, including kids, where they ended up. *That* is taking responsibility. She had just the right balance of care for the kids, as she looks for the lost girl, and for solving the current issue. Now Danny on other hand..

Danny has his head so far up his arse that he sees the world in black and white. There is a mysterious forest outside, engulfing the entire city, and he is squabbling with Clara that she called the Doctor first instead of school, only person who can make sense of the situation they are in, (mind you, Danny didn't call school/parents either, so much for that), or that she was traveling with Doctor before. Oh and the kid's welfare? Much good he does there, losing Maebh, although they are both at fault there. Sure, get kids home and ignore calling the Doctor. Much good that would do good if the forest turned out malicious and nukes them all. In the long run his approach would have caused more harm than good imho. I am not ""attacking"" Danny for caring about the kids, but for doing so in an illogical and over the top manner, disregarding everything else. Not what, but *how*. 

*Probably* Danny meant well, and I am not arguing they should have completely ditched the kids and went on a jungle safari. But the way he behaved, completely ignorant of everything but the kids made it over the top and illogical given the situation, while Clara acted much more balanced and rational. You seem to think that it's about one or the other. Either you care about the kids, or you don't at all. No, it's about the balance which Danny displayed none of. Clara displayed multitasking and depth, Danny was all ""muh kids"", thus my original comment.

We have a squad of young quality, that needs time to develop under a young manager who himself is developing and has shown he is good at getting youth to prosper. 

Mason and Kane have been good so far, a bit more and they could for sure be quality. I'm not saying I see either of them becoming world beaters or anything, but for sure quality squad players in a top 4 club. 

Our problem is time. We need to give the squad, club, and manager time to grow and develop, something I don't think we've done recently. We as fans need to stop expecting top 4 every year. We need to expect good performances, yes, but we just can't compete long term with spending powers like the other top clubs. Give this team a full two seasons, with good smart aditions, and then we can start hoping for and really expecting top 4. We need time, and a lot of us seem to be impatient. That's not going to be good for anyone long term. I think next year, after Poch has a full season of managing a bigger club like us in relation to Southampton, that we can start to finally see things pay off. 

Another unfortunate reality is that we might have to wait till after the stadium to seriously expect consistent top 4 challenges from us. Like I've said, time. Losses like today are terribly annoying and disheartening. But long term we will be better off than Newcaslte. Let's at least wait till December - January till we seriously start ringing the warning bells.

false,MadArend,num20,,"Dier, Vertonghen, Capoue, Lamela, and Adebayor all started on Thursday.  It's not surprising that they were all off the pace today, especially Dier who is a CB playing RB.  Playing a CB at fullback two days per week is a recipe for disaster (*see also:* 2013-14 Vertonghen).  I really hope we see Chiriches at RB against Brighton.  We *need* Dier to play well in the league, which means we *must* rest him in cup matches.

Of our five fresh outfield players (Eriksen only played 15' on Thursday), only Chadli was poor:

* Rose and Mason played very well.  I love much better Rose has become since we got Davies, and I'm liking Mason more and more each week.  I'd like to see a Mason-Stambouli pairing soon -- so much workrate in CM there.

* Eriksen wasn't brilliant but actually made a lot of good plays and won back possession several times and was often our main forward outlet.  

* Kaboul got caught out a couple of times, but but I won't get on him too much because he spent half the match covering for/helping out Dier.  Lost too many aerial challenges though.

* Chadli was poor.  Wasn't connecting at all with our other attackers, which is very strange.  Sometimes a guy has an off day.

So I mainly put today's performance down to the fact that we played half of our first team in Europa League (understandable given our need for points in that competition).  As long as we don't do that very often, we'll be fine.

**TL;DR:** We had six players who played poorly, and five of those six were tired from playing all or most of Thursday's match.  *No need to panic.*",0,1414365597,null,0,false,0,clkm7lq,t3_2kdhca,t1_clkm7lq,t3_2kdhca,null,1426336397,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Damn. You're painting me as some kind of pro-Levy hardliner. Of course he's made bad decisions along the way. Tightening our pursetrings and so on and so on. It's not a state secret that people disagree with a lot of his decisions. I wouldn't have loaned out Holtby or have asked Bale to give another year while we brace for his inevitable departure while building a competitive first team rather than an entirely new squad. 

&gt;Football is a simple game and Redknapp knows it.

Apparently the transfer aspect of it isn't. With one of the bigger transfer budgets for a recently promoted Championship side, it all looks like it's been spent on shit. The same thing happened to us. See Pienaar, Saha, Gallas, even Bassong. We bought midtable drivel when our manager and scouting network should've been looking for CL caliber players. 

&gt;we sacked him so that AVB could make all the same mistakes at WHL that he made at Chelsea.

We sacked him because he thought he was too big for Spurs and wanted the England job. The corruption stuff while the whole thing was going on didn't exactly help. 

&gt;AVB could make all the same mistakes at WHL that he made at Chelsea.

I wasn't the biggest fan of AVB either when he was announced.

&gt;Pochettino is a novice who has achieved nothing in the game.

Who's your suggestion for the job then? 

&gt;I would have taken Rodgers to Spurs.

He looks like him and the transfer committee have made the same mistakes that AVB/Baldini/Levy/ have made. Why would Rodgers be the prefered option? Because he's British? Crazy. 

&gt;Adel Taarabt is a fucking joke. I don't really care what he says or thinks.
 
Do you care what VdV thinks in that case?

&gt;âItâs not that we do nothing â but itâs close to that,â he added. âFor instance, last weekend Gareth Bale scored a header against Blackburn from my corner. But we didnât train one minute on it, it was pure luck. Good kicking, good heading, nothing more. And our win at home over Champions League winners Inter Milan was a clear example of playing on intuition. You canât train the goal I scored in that game.â

So it's based on intuition and knowing what works. This benefits only the good players and sort of makes everybody else a passenger in the match. There's no Plan A when they played, which was nice to watch for sure, but we had tons of games where we just couldn't unlock defenses. I don't remember who we were playing, but it was just frustrating and in the closing weeks of 11-12. 

&gt;hiring foreign managers just because their stock is high just sets the club back.

I think you mean proven. If we were going after Rudi Garcia or Roger Schmidt or Bielsa or any other countless manager, I'd be over the moon. It's not like well-known managers who come to big clubs have a track record of losing (Bielsa maybe, but he should ideally be hired for immediate impact).

Quite frankly I do like *some* of the Green Policies (mainly on drugs and minimum wage), but the vast majority are stupid, unworkable and quite frankly impossible. Their anti-science, nuclear &amp; GMO is a massive downfall for me, as is their complete lack of any feasible economic policy. 

I prioritise the economy, cutting immigration and getting out of the EU asap. UKIP promise what I want on all of them. 

Working class people are suffering due to the wage depression caused by mass immigration. Leaving the EU and imposing fairer points-based immigration will alleviate that issue. 

The main 2 parties will be seen by a lot of people as a ""safe"" option and so they'll always get a lot of the vote.

The lib Dems have blown their chance in power.

UKIP are giving the electorate answers to questions that need to be sorted. They're also helped by the ever-suave Farage. His charm and quick-wit have really helped the public image of UKIP.

Greens are an unknown entity. They have a rather poor leadership with no one recognisable and able to play the media like Farage does.

They're completely characterless - I've rented tiny rural cottages and period townhouses too which are charming as fuck but the wonky floors and damp in winter quickly wear that off. 

I move roughly every 18 months - the whole house, gf and all. When we do it now, we look for streets like this because on balance they are the right mix of functional and hassle free, which as chronic renters we've come to value quite highly.

false,FoxOfShadows,dalek,Dalek,"I'll go through one by one:


I found 'Deep Breath' actually quite enjoyable. A great introduction to the new doctor with some great moments (The restaurant scene) and an interesting and at some points sinister villain. The Paternoster gang were unnecessary and hindered the show more than helped it. Aside from that, a good beginning to the series.


'Into the Dalek' was a bit of a 'meh' episode. I love Dalek's but they were underused in the episode. The Doctor made some bad decisions (Did he think the Dalek would stay good) and it was a bit of a boring story. However, the scene where the Doctor talks to Rusty face to face was great, especially when Rusty starts talking abut hatred. The Doctor's reaction is great and the whole 'Am I a good man' has been a pretty good theme throughout the series


'Robot of Sherwood' was nowhere near as bad as people are making it out to be (Aside from the gold arrow ending). It was a breath of fresh air, an episode that had no relevance to the overall plot or anything but still quite enjoyabl and funny at times. The ending was stupid but there have been many worse this series. I'll get to those later.


'Listen' was a great episode but not the best of the series. It started great as the Doctor and Clara went to see young Danny Pink. However, when they went to the future, it lost some of the reality that episodes like 'Flatline' and 'Hide' use to make them so scary. Clara going to Gallifrey was a good twist but left plenty of questions that need answering. And who was under Danny's covers?


'Time Heist' was, similar to 'Robot of Sherwood' an unnecessary but good episode. It was better than RoS as the plot in general was a lot sturdier. There were some great scenes and the supporting cast were great. A fun, enjoyable episode.


I watched 'The Caretaker' again this morning and actually found it quite good. The character development was done well and was a good episode to establish Danny's role as Clara's boyfriend to the Doctor (Although that backflip was ridiculous). The Skovox Blitzer was very interesting ad very well designed and even though it was kind of a sub-plot, it was still interesting.


'Kill the Moon' is a complicated episode for me. Up until the Doctor reveals that the moon is an egg, the episode was going swimmingly. The spiders were great and very scary. The setting was also very unique. Courtney was infuriating and did not need to be there but aside from that, it started brilliantly. However, when it became a ridiculous debate about killing or saving a baby space dragon, it plummeted. Clara ignoring the Earth's decision was insulting and the creature laying a new egg was the nail in the coffin. I think the biggest problem with the episode was all the hype and attention it got before it aired. Everyone thought it would be a masterpiece but it dissapointed everyone.

'Mummy on the Orient Express' was the best episode of the series (so far). Great setting, great monster, great cast and obviously a great writer. It was paced brilliantly and din't have any stupid resolution story tagged onto it. Scary, thrilling and funny. I adored the clock in the bottom corner and the Doctor vs The Foretold was the most thrilling moment of the whole series. 10/10


'Flatline' was almost as good but I think but something makes me like MotOE a little bit more. Another fantastic episode with wonderful pacing and some genuinely frightening monsters. A unique concept executed very well. Another brilliant episode.


'Forest of the Night' was, for me, the worst episode of the series especially coming after two episodes that I would but very high in a list of best NewWho episodes. Bad acting, bad story (What even happened in the episode?) and no threat whatsoever. Similar to kill the moon, trailers overhyped it and we were left with a dull, pointless episode. Also, that ending was the worst of any new Doctor Who episode I can think of.

Overall, actually been a pretty good series. Capaldi is fantastic. Clara is 'meh' but he next episode seems like it could change that. Danny is pointless but bearable.

3. Clara and missy are the same people and are the Drs and rivers child. Which would allow for looking different and being where she is due to also being a child of the tardis. 
4. Missy is the master and Clara is rivers child with the Dr. 
Why would Clara go through being the impossible girl and saving the 11th so much to try to kill him. That's also something that bugs me.

One of the stand out things that I recall from the game was Clichy bringing the ball out of the back after a West Ham attack broke down in the first half. He was isolated bringing the ball out of the area in a wide position, as he came out, a West Ham player came towards him to put pressure on him. He had no clear options in front of him, no outlet for a pass, so he did a half turn and passed it back to Mangala - or where Mangala should have been.

But Mangala wasn't there, he was half asleep and was stood still near the six yard box. He hadn't recognised the need to spread out and go to Clichy giving him and outlet for a pass. Kompany was in fact clattering into him from behind as he'd recognised the situation long before Mangala had from his right sided centre half position.

I saw that all clearly as I was right behind the goal in the away end, and I thought it was particularly poor, it was Mangala's strengths and weaknesses in microcosm at the moment:

Poor decision making and often dubious tactical awareness, but great physicality and raw athleticism - for it is precisely that which bailed him out and allowed him to reach the back pass *just* before a West Ham player intercepted it and had a clear goal scoring opportunity.

Of course Clichy shouldn't have played the pass blindly, but he was right to expect Mangala to have spread out and come towards him. They were both culpable, but I thought that was a good example of the Mangala's strengths and weaknesses in one isolated example.

This is something anyone who'd watched or read about Mangala would be aware of however. He isn't the finished article, his price tag is largely borne out of potential. He still has learning to do, and he still needs to bring a consistency to his game - as was demonstrated by a fantastic performance against Chelsea, and then a terrible one against Hull just 7 days later.

The surge in low skilled labour hits the working classes hardest, as the immigrants are willing to work for less and drive wages down. As for unemployment...that's falling but it's lower amongst immigrants, because again, they work for less. The recession has very little to do with the effect immigration has. Controlled immigration is undoubtedly good for the economy. But uncontrolled, unpredictable, mass low-skilled migration drives down the wage equilibrium for low skilled workers and increases welfare payments.

Leaving Europe won't mean we suffer at all. We can't make independent trade agreements as a member of the EU. As soon as we get out we can. Switzerland has 58 independent trade agreements. The EU has 34. The EU only has 2 of the 8 up and coming economies (Turkey &amp; Mexico out of Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico, Nigeria, Indonesia, Turkey).

Research suggests these can irritate, dehydrate and thin even a healthy skin barrier at concentrations as low as 1%. For reference shampoo is up to 20%. Even shampoo *bubbles* running down  my arm was the trigger for my elbow patch of atopic eczema. Skincare just became so much easier as I got rid of these harsh surfactants - hands, lips, niggly dry patches, greasy t-zone normalised.

I just think the guy gets far too much credit on here. He handles the business side of the club superbly but at the expense of the team's stability and success. He's not that different to Mike Ashley in my opinion in the sense that he's driven by the bottom line rather than winning trophies.

&gt; Apparently the transfer aspect of it isn't.

You can take apart any manager's transfer policy. I actually thought Gallas was a great signing. Defoe and Robbie Keane were both brought in by Harry and were massive successes.

&gt; We sacked him because he thought he was too big for Spurs and wanted the England job. The corruption stuff while the whole thing was going on didn't exactly help.

 Yes he wanted the England job but Levy should have told him to shut up rather than firing him. He was cleared of the corruption stuff.

&gt; Why would Rodgers be the prefered option? Because he's British? Crazy.

Rodgers is a very talented coach. He would have built something at Spurs given the chance. I genuinely believe British coaches like Martin O'Neill who understand the game and culture have an advantage. Unless you are bringing in a world class coach like Mourinho you're better off looking closer to home.

&gt; Do you care what VdV thinks in that case?

It's interesting to read VdV's comments. I don't think Redknapp is the world's best coach but his methods were far more effective than AVB who over analysed everything. Footballers are often not very clever. They appreciate having their ego massaged and they appreciate the game being made simple. Redknapp put good players on the park and asked them to express themselves. As a result we had the best football in the last 30 years. Now the football is mediocre. We're chopping and changing managers. We don't know our best team. We have quality players but are not getting the best out of them. The support is massively discontent. Levy has hardly taken us in a better direction compared to what Redknapp was giving us.

&gt; If we were going after Rudi Garcia or Roger Schmidt or Bielsa or any other countless manager, I'd be over the moon.

No thanks. I want a manager with a perfect grasp of English to handle the media, the board and most importantly the dressing room. Klopp would be my dream appointment but that's not realistic.

The U.K. uses the First Past the Post voting system.  This voting system *tends* to create de-facto two party systems.  While the Liberal Democrats do occupy a significant space in the U.K. system; to be honest they're very unlikely to capture Parliament by themselves or to even lead a coalition government, making the U.K. effectively a contest between Conservative and Labour.  Indeed, the only reason why small parties (like the Greens, UKIP, Plaid Cymru, etc;) have any representation at all is because they have very strong local support in specific constituencies (which are small, compared to American congressional districts.) 

This may also be said to be true of the LibDem's support in Scotland, but I'm not enough of an expert to really identify that as a possibility. 

Moving to the alternative vote (STV) would make voting for ""third"" parties, including the Lib Dems, more viable, and honestly, if you truly support the Green party, you should probably identify a Conservative or Labour candidate that supports AV and help them get elected.  

In the U.S., I'm a Democrat; though I have Green sympathies - the joke is that the U.S. Green Party has the same things as the Democratic party in their platform, but the Democrats don't actually care about the platform after they get elected. There's more than a little truth to that, I'm sorry to say.  Point is, though, I know that it will be futile to support any Green campaign until we first fix our broken campaign finance system here in the U.S., and once we've done that, moved to a STV or PR based system.

false,Destructor1701,silence,Silence,"Forrest Of The Night is the first episode this season where the consensus on Reddit has significantly diverged from my own impression of the episode.

Every other time, there has been at least a significant chunk of this community who view the episode in the same light as I do.

I rather enjoyed FOTN, while seeing the very many glaring flaws, but not really caring because it was enjoyable. Reddit seems to be of the opinion that this episode needs to be expunged.

This is the first case where I have stopped reading the discussion thread because it was exposing flaws I hadn't noticed and making me dislike the episode.

All that said, I think this season has been a real stinker, overall. No classics. No tear-jerkers. No rip-roaring adventures.

Instead of adding more reams of text, I'll bullet point my feelings on the season:

* Very Good:
 - Flatline  
 - Mummy On The Orient Express

* Good:
  - Time Heist

* Alright:
  - The Caretaker
  - Listen

* Fun-but-very-flawed:
  - Robot Of Sherwood
  - In The Forest Of The Night

* Poor:
  - Deep Breath
  - Into The Dalek

* Abysmal:
  - Kill The Moon

Most episodes have a lot of redeeming qualities - for example, Kill The Moon has some fantastic scenes, scenery, action, and dialogue - but in most cases there's one or two scenes, or one or two concepts or executions, that simply murder the episode's appeal, suspension of disbelief, or fun-factor.

I think it's a continuation of a plotting problem that seems to have crept into the writer's room gradually since the start of Moffat's run, but really became an issue in the latter half of season 7.

Simply put: This shit don't make no sense.

This is **not** anything to do with Capaldi - he's thoroughly inhabited The Doctor now. Despite the nonsense he's had to say and do, he *is* the character, and a very amusing and unique version of this man. 

I really like Danny Pink, but I feel like this latest episode turns both he and Clara into bumbling buffoons who should never be allowed near children. 

Clara has developed something that vaguely resembles a character, but she's had to be bent and contorted through some completely ridiculous emotional hairpins to develop it - all of it totally over-stretched and half-baked. Jenna Coleman deserves better.

The World characterized it as ""more like a glowworm than a beacon."" ... The United States Lighthouse Board took over the Statue of Liberty in 1887 and pledged to install equipment to enhance the torch's effect; in spite of its efforts, the statue remained virtually invisible at night. ... In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt, once a member of the New York committee, ordered the statue's transfer to the War Department, as it had proved useless as a lighthouse.

So you'd be pretty correct whether you say the statue is a lighthouse (it was intended to be) or isn't one (it never was one, in practice).

Regards to your white line statement, I shall shed some like. 

You must not cross a solid white line closest to you, except;

When passing a stationery hazard (parked car, water, ice, debris etc)

When passing a highway maintainace vehicle going slower that 10mph (I believe thats the speed without checking) that is displaying a keep right sign on the back (blue circle with a white arrow facing to the bottom right)

Theres a couple of others too but these are what are relevent to your statement. 

So answer to your question. Technically you can filter on the solid white line if the vehicles you are passing are fully stationary. Just be super observant. 

It also means that if you are riding behind a car and you can see past it clearly but cross a solid line (even if it is travelling at 5mph) youre commiting a traffic offense. 

As an ambulance response driver (blue lights) we are still meant to observe the rule and we are not meant to pass a car on a solid white line unless they are fully stationary. Problem is people dont understand this and never stop. So we wouldn't always get anywhere so we just stay safe :)

That's football, though. All of the clubs in the PL are owned by sheikhs or by businessmen. Perfect example would be Kroenke's ownership of Arsenal or FSG's ownership of Liverpool. You either get them two or you get Sheikh Mansour and Abramovich. It's not just a uniquely Spurs problem I think. 

&gt;Rodgers is a very talented coach. He would have built something at Spurs given the chance.

We just don't know that. He had a hard time bedding in to Liverpool in his first season. He lost 3-0 to West Brom and didn't win for a while in his first season. The difference would be that he gets a free pass by the media because he's British. Nobody's questioning his transfer policy, specifically getting Balotelli, even though that buy directly contradicts his ""we are about team ethic and go again and something something won't do a Spurs"" dogma. Whenever it's a foreign manager having a rough start, it's ""not understanding the culture of the game"" (Rodgers never even played professionally-Poch has played in the French and Barcelona derbies. He cried at retirement because he loved Espanyol like a family. Has Rodgers ever had that kind of professional attachment?), but whenever it's a British manager, it's ""it takes time to gel"" and all that. I don't get it. 

He's such a cringy bastard . I really do think Rodgers overcompensates with the stupid measured tone shit because he hasn't played at a pro level. Telling LvG that the PL is going to be hard is good advice, if it came from someone like Mourinho or Pelligrini, but from him? What reference does he have for saying that kind of thing? The Championship?

&gt;Redknapp put good players on the park and asked them to express themselves.

Can I ask you this: would Redknapp have built a better squad than what we have no had he stuck around and nothing changed except for that? As in, we miss CL, Modric goes to Madrid, VdV is back to Hamburg, and Bale leaves a season later. Who do you think we would've gotten? Redknapp would likely have gotten out his little black book and given some of his old boys a call. We'd stagnate because man management only takes you so far nowadays, and eventually drop off because our squad overall hasn't improved. City would overtake us anyway with cash injections and we'd be hovering around 8th-9th once he gets sacked in July of 2014, after failed negotiations regarding the amount of transfer money available. I don't think that that's an unreasonable outcome. In that case, it'd be both on Levy and Redknapp. 

We have a younger squad than before. There's not even a VdV figure to show you just *how* to fuckin' run around a bit. With this squad, I don't think we'd be much better off with 'Arry than we are now.

&gt;I want a manager with a perfect grasp of English to handle the media, the board and most importantly the dressing room.

I can't tell if you're insinuating that Poch's English isn't very good. I can definitely understand him better than 'Arry. 

&gt;I would give the job to Martin O'Neill if he was available.

I think it's more likely an allegory for Clara unexpectedly getting pregnant, having to decide whether she wants to keep the baby or keep her existing life, eventually deciding to embrace motherhood; hopefully Danny is better at giving advice through this than the Doctor is in KTM.

(Lundvik and Courtney come to their decisions quickly and easily: it's not about them.)

An alien? *Something* that isn't a schizophrenic child off her meds!), remove the missing sister subplot that was forced in at the last minute (which if it had been handled correctly, it would have made for a strong and powerful story, but they did it ***wrong***), and made the trees something else... not regular trees, wtf Moffat? Imagine this story:

Clara's friend (the one who's children she was baby sitting when  she met the Doctor) is having strange nightmares about being lost in the woods, the Doctor stalking her from afar. She always wakes up when she turns around and sees his old, sad and tired face. Clara recognizes the description of the Doctor, and calls a 4 person meeting (her, Danny, the Doctor and the friend), so that the Doctor can see what's wrong. There's a small crack in time (like in Christmas, not dangerous. Just universal scar tissue) near her house, it might be giving her visions of what's to come. Clara's friend has been having fights with her daughter, this night she runs away. The Doctor stays overnight (being tactless about the daughter running away) to see if this crack can be traced back to the Time Lords. Analysis using the TARDIS tells him otherwise. A rumbling is heard in the morning (and a faint tardis materialization?). The Doctor, Clara, Danny and Clara's friend step outside to see that London covered in trees. 

[Halfway through, the hypothetical episode, now.]

A few animals are reported missing from the zoo, so they must run around London trying to find the woman's daughter, before she runs into danger. She's talking to some luminous creatures about how she's not allowed to be independent, how she's frustrated with her inability to be free. They find her near an energy concentration of the forest. The Doctor gets a warning that a solar flair will approach earth. He fears the worse, but it seems earth isn't getting a massive one like the one that destroyed the bank, but it might still be very dangerous. We see government officials failing to burn and chop the trees down and capturing the lost animals. They are tough alien trees with thin trunks and weirdly colored leaves. These trees are beginning to block the sun, the Doctor recognizes them as protective organic material, of Gallifreyan origin... he knows what he must do, he races into the TARDIS, leaving everyone behind to their apparent deaths (solar flair, also, he forgets to tell them what the trees are). He returns almost immediately and tells them that the trees were planted by him the night before, to save earth from this possible disaster. He scolds humanity (well, the four humans in front of him) for being mistrustful of trees, and that now, maybe they'll appreciate more the ones they have now, reduce the rate of chopping them down. He takes the group into the tardis to show them the trees absorb the energy of the solar wind and dissipate into the land with that orange energy effect they use for the regeneration.

We close with the daughter getting an understanding talk with the mom and Clara telling Danny that it reminds her of the moon incident. Independence from the Doctor is a *good* thing for humanity. The news is celebrating the day the trees saved the world.

Near me, we've got one of those new popup towns being built and there's about 6 different house builders putting up units. It's a bit of a level playing field as far as values go - it's so new there are no desirable neighbourhoods etc. But a 3 bed house with a garage ranges from Â£180k to upwards of Â£240k with similar square footage. The people that whinge about all new houses being shit will be the ones who paid 180 - what exactly do they think the difference is? Granted there's probably not 60k of difference but the cheaper one is obviously being built to a lower standard. Both will be up to building regs and both will have the 10 year warranty but the difference in quality was immediately obvious when looking at show homes. 

Look at some of the shit being built in the 50s and 60s - even our precious Victorian terraces vary hugely in quality. The reason we're seeing more shit houses is were becoming more consumer oriented. People saying that you shouldn't buy a new house because it's built like shit are just circlejerking - you just shouldn't buy a shit house.

Yeah.  Flat bread is the way to go.  Western bread you have as an accompaniment to something.  Good flat bread you just want to eat on its own.

I think the best bread I have had has come from Morocco.  There's a massive French colonial influence and the Moroccans took the idea of a Boulangerie and really ran with it.  Yeah you can get French sticks and the like but they also make Hobb.  Hobb is a local Berber bread, that's round, flat (about 1 1/2 inches thick and the size of a dinner plate.  Its got a great crust and a fluffy white inner like a French stick.

false,Millzy91,null,null,"Good morning, here is my tuppence worth for starting a new business: 

First and foremost your business plan. If you have not already written one please do, it takes all your thoughts and puts them on a page that anyone can pick up and understand. This will be extremely beneficial for any future investment, ensuring you are on track, and to remind you exactly what business you are in (sounds silly but as you grow small companies often fall into the trap of trying to do too much too soon). On that note your business plan should focus on a niche market and follow a differentiation strategy, not one where you compete on lowest costs (competing on costs only work for the big boys with years of experience and who can utilise economies of scale). Do market and competitor analyses: you can use waffley tools such as strategic mapping, but something simple as who are my main competitors, whom do they serve, how much do they charge, and how can I be different? One aspect you can leverage that fits in with attracting customers and marketing is locality. Target the local Edinburgh market to begin with, in particular small businesses who may not have the time and resources to develop their own web presence and who may want to support local. Never underestimate how important your local market is! If you are struggling with a business plan business gateway or Edinburgh chamber of commerce will be able to help you with it.

Right, now we know roughly what market we are in and what customers we serve, it's time to develop a brand. This is a deceivingly difficult task and is much more than a pretty logo. Your brand presence embodies the complete values of the company. One tool to use is kampferer's brand prism. It is a diagram that makes you pick out specific aspects of your company and that can be used to create your brand. Don't rush this task, as all future interactions with customers whether face to face or through marketing information must be considerate of what the brand values are.

Marketing time! This is an area I could go into huge depth with, but without a huge knowledge of your company or your target customers my advice is limited. Once you have identified the type of customer you need to figure out the best means of contacting them. Social media presence is a must (and hootsuite is an excellent way of managing it). The key is to judge what sort of things your audience would want to hear. Pictures of your dinner and pet cats work well on reddit, but for a professional social media presence it is key to engage your audience with industry relevant posts such as new developments in the industry and pose them engaging questions. The key is to deliver a platform for two way communication where meaningful relationships are developed. When this happens your audience will share more of your posts and spread your brand for you. Look at Christopher's ladder of loyalty for turning potential customers and your audience into advocates for your brand. One important aspect however is how much of your social brand you submit to the hands of your audience. It may work in your favour as the audience works well and spreads, but a few nasty comments can go viral so that is always something to bear in mind.

However do not forget about face to face communication. It develops a much more meaningful connection with customers who may be wary of trusting a few business. Go to as many networking events as possible, speak to people and you may get contacts. Even if not, your presence at events will get you known in the right circles. Given that funds are tight as a start up avoid large scale print media. If it suits your needs (again this is affected by the brand) interesting business cards or fliers that grab people's attention are a low cost means of getting your brand name out. 

I see on your website there are a few mock up websites under portfolio. One excellent bit of advice I received from a business consultant is to do a few freebies for family friends. This allows you to build up your competence and with this new (and hopefully well received) portfolio of projects you can show prospective customers what you are capable of. Also customers will trust you more if they believe others have commissioned you to work (they don't have to know it was a freebie!). From then on gradually increase your fee with every project you go (this will be justified by your increasing competence).

Other general advice - keep your books up to date. If you have good experience of accounts excellent, but that may take up a lot of your time. You can hire a company to manage your books for you. Be prepared to fail. Most small businesses fail, so use this as a learning curve and develop for future. Rely on family and friends for moral support and guidance, if your business dies at least you still have them to pick you up. Talk to as many people in and out of the industry as possible to make contacts and pick up new skills, on that note read up on and new industry developments.

&gt; **Overall the impacts of migrants on average wages and on the wage
distribution discussed in the review of existing literature were modest[1]** and
tended to be positive at the top of the wage distribution and negative at the
bottom. As we would expect workers in low-skilled jobs to be at the bottom
end of the wage distribution, this would suggest that the negative impact
would fall be on those working in low-skilled jobs. Most of the academic
studies found smaller or no impact on employment and unemployment
outcomes of native workers. [...]

&gt; There have been local areas, occupations and sectors which have
experienced a larger or more rapid increase in migrants than the national
average. We might expect that this migration is more likely to have
impacted the labour market specific to these local areas than average
estimates for the national level suggest. **There was no consistent pattern
in local labour market indicators among the areas with a high share of
migrants in employment in low-skilled jobs** which supported that fact that
each local area would need to be considered individually to assess any
impacts of migration.

[1] - By ""modest"", they mean that the wage impact was typically Â± Â£2 **per year**. That's microscopic! 

There is no way this amounts to a problem of national concern. The effects on wages are microscopic. For low income people, the vast increases in food prices over the last few years have imposed a vastly greater burden than the couple of pounds *per year* they may have lost in income.

&gt; sacking AVB was a reactionary decision  
  
God I loved that handsome man. I know after Bale left the football wasn't great. There were solid reasons to sack him I guess, but still I remain convinced he would have gotten us going had he just been given time!  
  
&gt; probably longer if he keeps us above 9th place, and I am very happy about that.  
  
Yepp agree again. I've said it before, I don't really care about where we come in the league this year (within reason). This year isn't about league position. We just have to use this season to get us playing nice football and gelling together. A crack at some silverware is more important than the league.  
  
&gt; people talking badly about inverted wingers don't seem to understand what traditional wingers do. Ade would have to completely change his game from what we have seen recently, and soldado isn't putting up good enough numbers to be our lone goalscorer. Kane, as much as I love him, can't be our lone goalscorer for the premier league for a multitude of reasons.  
  
If Ade was playing as he does at the minute the crosses would be finding nobody. Soldado, I want him to do well so badly but he just has never taken his chances and looks so low on confidence atm I wouldn't trust him to score anymore.  
  
What reasons would you have for not having Kane as lone striker? For me if Kane makes starting 11 it's going to be at the expense of Chadli or Lamela... He seems more like a cross between a striker and a number 10. Not sure how he'd do all on his own.  
 
&gt; he didn't play it against arsenal thank god  
  
I've taken it as a positive that Poch recognises when we  need to change to take on certain teams. The sooner both Kyles are back the better.

This idea that the Taliban was opposed to opium production is incorrect, for much of their reign opium was their only real source of income.

* Crumpets sometimes.
* English muffins.
* Patisserie, mostly savoury but I make an exception for good pastries.

What if I repeatedly shout ""I'M GLAD YOU WERE RAPED"" at a rape victim? What if I round up as many people as I can to do the same? That's not inciting violence, but something personally I don't think should really be legal.

I don't think we should restrict peoples movement, yet I also agree that stalking shouldn't be legal. I think that people should be allowed to say things publicly that I disagree with, but *at least personally* I only really agree with that if they're saying something constructive. I'm fine with someone making a case for marxism, for complete anarchy, or for clamping down on immigration or bringing back the death penalty. 

I'm not fine with harassment.

Now that it's so easy to send a message that will reach millions, it's very hard to find a line of where someone is being rude or disagreeable and where they're actually harassing people. Sending direct messages is a much more easily defined problem, but large group messages get very hard.

The insurance company is looking to cap their liability. They've assessed the risks that you will continue taking Â£80k PA and how that affects their balance sheet and they're looking to minimise their overall costs (there are side-issues like the fact that these kind of open-ended liabilities have a serious effect on their Basel figures).

Your employer is looking to do the same thing - their insurance bills will be going through the roof by way of increased premiums on their Group PHI. By making you redundant they run the risk of coming up against tribunal (discriminative dismissal type approach) and so they will look for gagging orders and so on, I'm sure.

When approaching complicated financial planning considerations it's best to look at the end result. You don't know what termination payout your employer would offer and it's worth discovering that first, ass there's a big blank in the numbers otherwise.

Say you bought a Â£300k house and invested the Â£500k (I don't know if that's realistic for where you live - do you need to live in London or could you consider buying in the commuter belt?) - You could reasonably expect an income return of ~ Â£20k PA (4%) from the investments, without eating into capital. Is that enough? 

Could you pursue other careers/self employment, i.e. where your past employment history won't be as important?

However,  I am not sure if I should cut down on the teams (perhaps 15 per league?)

The paper's response.

&gt;One, are we really comfortable with doctors lying to patients, telling them that a treatment is medically effective when we know that it's not? 

Well, if the placebo effect is working in this case, then it *is* medically effective. The placebo effect is a real thing. And if lying to some patients is what it takes to make them better, why is that a bad thing?

&gt;Two, you're absolutely right: in a double-blind trial, homeopathy patients would show some improvement. But, and here is the important thing, the patients in the control group would show the exact same improvement. 

I could be wrong, but I'm guessing that this is at least partly because they are getting the homeopathic treatment. I would be surprised if ""I'm going to treat you with some entirely ineffective sugar pills"" would have quite the same effect. Of course, for some people, completely different placebos are likely to be as (or even more) effective. But for people who believe in homeopathy, then maybe it's an effective placebo for those instances where placebos are the most appropriate treatment.

As Bennett says

&gt; ""I think there is a very small and limited place on the NHS for homeopathy"", 

which (again, if the placebo claims are actually backed up in trials) seems entirely reasonable.

So in early September last month, I posted the question âWhat do you think of Dutch Cuisine?â on the German, British, Belgian, and French subreddits and compiled all the responses into a Wordle.


I thought reddit would like to see the results of some reddit based research! 


For those interested: 
We are 5 hospitality students studying in the Netherlands, and our projectâs objective is to define the current culinary image of the Netherlands from the perspective of German, British, Belgian, and French tourists, and ultimately use the research data and results to design a culinary image improvement campaign for the Netherlands. 

If you are German, British, Belgian, or French, and have a few minutes to spare, we would truly appreciate it if you could fill out the questionnaire below and share it with a couple of friends!

---

&gt;__Locked-in syndrome__ (__LIS__) is a condition in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the eyes. __Total locked-in syndrome__ is a version of locked-in syndrome wherein the eyes are paralyzed as well.  [Fred Plum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Plum) and [Jerome Posner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_B._Posner) coined the term for this disorder in 1966.   Locked-in syndrome is also known as __cerebromedullospinal disconnection__,  __de-efferented state__, __pseudocoma__,  and __ventral pontine syndrome__.

The high figures, the idea of 79,300,000 'visits', I would say that for the supply, it's more of a moral issue around human trafficking.

Definitely, and that's what i think makes the caretaker role quite an easier one, there is no pressure to succeed. And you have a bunch of players looking to turn things around. In his full stints (albeit at shite sides), redfearn's management was a travesty. The grim prediction - Redders will get the sack by December. I only hope he has a clause to reinstate him into the academy at such point.

Should Darko have gone? Was he negative etc?
Should he have gone? No. Was he negative? Yes, but i believe it was out of desperation as he new he needed a win. In the end ironically that mentality cost him the job.

I'd assume about the same. If there is no agreement about those costs, the court can decide how to handle them. There is already the same incentive in place for the ""well-funded government department"" to refuse an agreement on costs. The only difference is that in the place of ambiguity, there now is none.

The internet is pretty new, but so far it has been like the wild west. A total free for all with no rules, which was like a separate reality, detached from real life. The law simply hasn't caught up yet, and right now it's in the process.

But the internet IS real life. You do your banking there, handle your investments, your house buying, your insurance, your love life, your private communications and your friends and family. And yes, your arguing, protesting, crime and everything else too. Before it was for geeks and a niche section of society only. Now it's used by almost everybody on a daily basis.

There is simply no way that the internet could continue in the way it has before over the last ~20 years where it was a free-for-all with almost no rules. We wouldn't tolerate a guy opening a high street shop selling fake handbags, so why would/should we tolerate it online? We don't tolerate harassment offline, so why is it more acceptable online? 

Same with hate speech - there are laws against it in real life and you can't be racist to people or stir up hatred without consequence. So why should it be allowed on an internet forum or a public messaging system like twitter?

All that's happening is that real life standards are being applied to online interactions too. Posting something on a public message board is akin to yelling it in a crowded city square. And private messaging somebody is akin to posting them a letter.

So - really we need to ask for better free speech AS A WHOLE. That at least makes things equal. If you want to call someone a cunt online, or insult their parents or whatever, you should also be able to do it offline to their face. And if you can't do it offline, you shouldn't be able to do it online either. If I'm allowed to post ""send the pakis home"" or ""kill all the gay sodomisers"" on a forum, I should also be able to preach it in my local town square.

false,iheke,null,null,"Good post.

1. On Kane. My reaction is always ""need more data"". Five substitution appearances in the PL for 64mins is just a snapshot into a young player that is clearly developing. I'm not going to even mention his PL stats because its pointless. In EL he has 270mins, his shots per game (4.3) and Key Passes (1) look good for a striker his age -- but the quality of opposition needs to be taken into account, and the degree to which he miscontrols passes and/or is dispossessed is not great. For comparative purposes, Soldado, with only 136 mins in PL hardly ever loses the ball (0.3 UnsTch and 0.5 Disp) and is a much better passer and key passer in tougher games so the difference ""on the ball is there"". To see what a horror show looks like - and the stats confirm what everyone is seeing ""in game"" Adebayor is losing the ball about 5 times per game from a miscontrolled pass or being dispossessed. He is just not retaining possession and distributing it well. The problem in a nutshell - Kane shoots more than enough but may lose you possession vs Soldado who links very well but doesn't shoot enough. I expect that Poch was hoping to build Soldado/Kane's confidence in the EL and then transfer to the PL but he's probably out of time.

2. Mason. Before I start focusing on Mason its probably worth beginning by saying that I'm not sure that Poch is managing the minutes situation very well at the base. Capoue looked like a man that has played 746 mins yesterday. I get it that he wants to create a settled side, but, Stambouli and Paulinho both have less than 30mins. Bentaleb and Dembele are on 250mins and Mason has clocked 350mins odd in very short order. Poch is not using the squad. I don't want to get all Raymond Veiheijen in this thread but if he wants a good performance from Capoue against Everton (Nov 30th) and then Chelsea (Dec 3rd) he needs to have his minutes reduced through the next 6 games. On to Mason, I'm starting to understand why Poch likes him and its all about the runs he makes, he is the most Adam Lallana-esque player we have. Also, he shoots more than any midfielder we have apart from those in the attacking front three. His problem, and they were particularly highlighted yesterday is that his control is poor and he is very easily tackled. There is not enough data on this guy so this is pure crystal ball but the question is whether those parts of his game can improve (along with his finishing), if so, he has a future at the club, if not he doesn't (he is ONLY 23).

3. Dier. I just disagree with you. He is delivering ELITE level numbers as a 20 year old. He's delivering the best defensive numbers from across all the defenders we have. He ranks top 5 in the league. We sell/loan him we'll be known as the club that traded the next Varane. He should be getting some rest rather than playing in all the games so he can watch and learn and develop some more. But our injury problems on the right side are proving pretty serious.

4. Siggurdsson. I was sad to see him go, but I respected Poch's decisiveness in dealing with our AMC issue (we had waaaay top many). He's nailed everything on Eriksen, Lamela and Chadli and that is how it should be.

5. CL places. Firstly, the obvious, 1st position is not possible. All the analysts were speaking online last night about how rock solid Chelsea are to win the league. The lowest probability you could find across a group of 20 analysts was 57% the highest 74% -- after only 9 games. Looking at the next 4 games (which are all winnable) they claim 3pts in those they may break the 100pt barrier this year. 2nd position looks like Man City's but at the current rate of accumulation they may be as much as 10pts behind Chelsea. The caveat behind this is that they had a Schedule tougher than Moyes' moanathon last year. If they can shake off the blues from losing to the Hammers and go on a monster run I expect they'll be tucked up right behind Chelsea in the shake up. The other two places 3rd and 4th are completely open right now. Southampton are a statistical quirk caused mainly by the fixtures and their rock solid home form. Their away form (and data) shows a clear signal that they are vulnerable to the better teams. I expect their away form will be tested by Hull and their home form will be thorougly tested by City, Arsenal, Utd back to back. Also we'll get a glimpse of their ""true"" position. West Ham is a team I'm more worried about - they've had a balanced schedule but maintain a positive GD home and away - they're scoring freely and defending well. More importantly, they're on a bit of a roll with only Stoke (a), Villa (h), Everton (a) and Newcastle (h) in front of them. Modelling shows them winning 3 from 4 of those which means they're going to stick around at the top of the table for a while yet. Looking at the ""Direct"" competitors - Arsenal, Everton, Liverpool. There is not enough data, but some clear trends. All three are weaker defensively than last year. Spurs are poor defensively but so are they, so in essence it is a foot race between us all to tighten up. Everton are the team whose attack is functioning best of all the competitors. It's generating similar numbers as last year in terms of chances, shots, shots on target. Arsenal are a mess at both ends due to injuries - with Christmas coming its likely to get worse before it gets better - but they have a warchest that can significantly change things in January should they choose to act. Liverpool - what can I say - Defensive press is failing, generating less shots, less chances, spending longer at EV/tied. Basically, they look like Spurs last year. The question is how long will it last, we got better in Feb. Offensively, Everton are an accident waiting to happen because their squad is so thin. It will be interesting to see what happens as we get deeper into EL. The team no one is talking about is Man Utd. The reason no one is speaking about them is because no one really knows - their numbers change game to game - literally. (e.g. If they were as tight defensively throughout the season as they were yesterday they would be far higher in the league with their schedule but because they have a Leicester City performance in them that's why they are where they are. They are the very definition unpredictability.) My views on fourth place is that the team that gets to an avg goal conceded of less than 1.5 pg will get fourth. However in Spurs' case I think we also need to get to a Goal Scored rate of greater than 2pg. With a conversion rate of 5% (1 goal in 20 shots) you can see where the issues are. I also don't think that telling midfielders to shoot from outside the box (60% of shots yesterday) at conversion rates far lower is the answer. Especially at home. To be fair to Poch, he's getting the 1-on-1's he likes but Chadli/Eriksen/Mason (yesterday) needed to convert.

TL:DR Kane/Mason good prospects. Dier is awesome. Sig had to go. 3rd and 4th place is wide open, team that fixes their defence quickest gets it.

I'm a referee and often take a moment to reflect on what i just saw and would encourage others to do the same, likewise if i some how get a clear glimpse of what happened through bodies of players and make the right call, i dont want to be questioned on my integrity. As for the Ivanovic Red it was probably not a yellow but I've seen them given, the real question is why was Ivanovic on a yellow. Im fairly sure (unless I'm remembering incorrectly) that he gave Ivans yellow for out-muscling Di Maria who took a dive earlier on. 

Also why is no-one else picking up on the fact that Fellaini (who assisted the equaliser) should not have been on the pitch. Phil Dowd saw an elbow on Luis from Fellaini and gave a foul, in the rules it can be a straight red, it was deliberate, see the incident or look at Felliani's history with elbows, he's a dirty cunt. I can understand it could have been a harsh red but a yellow was surely the minimum, later he tugs Hazard back for a indisputable yellow that should have been his second.

There were lots of little calls (mainly fouls on Hazard) that didnt go our way and did go United's way but i was wearing my blue specs and may have exaggerated the little 50/50 ones in my head.

Penalty calls were in the words of Drogba after Barcelona a few years back, ""a fucking disgrace"".

_That_ is the attitude of a snob.  My contention is that that is not the case, your actions only reveal what you are, not where you're from.

&gt; and what is ""good"" behaviour?

You put good in quotes, but I didn't say good.  I said people judge on your behaviour.  They will decide their own scale; and it will be different for different groups.  What a Welsh ex-miner thinks is ""good"" will be different from what the Duke of Westiminster thinks is ""good"".  In both cases, if you don't match up with their definition you will find it hard to integrate with their groups.

&gt; You can deny all of this, but it doesn't stop any of it being true.

I'm not denying there are class differences -- you are indeed less likely to be a lawyer if you are born on a council estate.  That's a different question though.  This article is making out that there are rules that stop you changing ""class"" -- there are not.  The upper-middle is full of people who's parents weren't.

I'm simply saying that ""class"" is no longer a function of your birth, it's a function of your actions -- as it should be.  One of the most snobby buggers I ever met was from the middle of Yorkshire and yet was working as an MP's private secretary (or whatever their entourage is called).

Perhaps I am being naive, and you are correct.  However, if everyone shared naivite like mine then class would not be such an issue you say it is.

false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;The law has lagged behind, and now politicians are trying to make it catch up. Obviously it's not perfect because the internet is decentralised and international, but they are doing whatever they can to start things off.

The law hasn't lagged behind at all, what makes you say that? [We have laws from 1990 which are still in good working order today.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Misuse_Act_1990) The implication being that things would be better if they got involved? Well I wholeheartedly disagree. The internet so far has failed to implode from it's own incompetence and has largely been absolutely fine without government poking it's nose in any further than it has done. Existing laws for harassment, counterfeiting and worse are fine and that's as far as it needs to go. If the problem is the police needing more resources to enforce existing laws then give it to them, don't write more laws that they can't enforce.

&gt;The current status of behaviour on the internet does not correspond with real life. 

Good. I'm glad of it. Most people *hate* real life. Why do you think there's so much escapism in the modern age? 

&gt; At the moment it is a lawless land, protected by relative anonymity, which gives people the power to do bad things (and good things too of course, I'm not pretending otherwise). 

It's not lawless at all, that is a total lie and a fabrication. People can be prosecuted for under existing laws. They are still doing illegal things and can still be caught and prosecuted if they are located inside the UK.

&gt;So can you really blame the government for wanting to close sites down, or block access, or require them to perform some sort of age check? 

This will not restrict any determined access. It won't stop teenagers viewing porn and buying drugs or whatever imagined Victorian moral outrage you want to construct. If you want to start talking about banning VPNs and encryption then businesses will leave in droves.

&gt;Obviously the proposals are flawed and not practical, but we have this massive double standard when it comes to dealings online where we tolerate things that we would not tolerate in real life equivalents.

There are plenty of unpleasant people in real life who receive no retribution for their misdemeanors, probably more so than the internet. People who barge infront of others, swear at people, go around intimidating others and worse. So where is this double standard? I've dealt with my fair share of internet drama over the years but it's nothing you can't just go ""Right, I've had enough of this"" and totally disengage from if you so choose.

&gt;For another example, if I can be arrested for saying ""send all the Pakis home"", or yelling ""I'm glad you were raped"" to a rape victim, why should I be allowed to post it on a public forum online? 

You *can* say that but it's deeply unpleasant. If you say or do something illegal online, you are still subject to the same laws. The issue is that we don't need new laws to cover this kind of stuff. The threats and problems are the same as they ever were but the medium has changed, that's all.

&gt;I am a fan of privacy and freedom, but we either need to change our real life standards, or we need to accept that the internet will eventually become similar to real life.

Another false dichotomy. How about we do neither? How about we keep real life standards, where there is the possibility of immediate physical violence, separate from digital media where sticks and stones may break my bones but I can always close my Twitter?

&gt;If calling someone a stupid nigger is ok online, it should be ok in person too.

It's not. Who told you it was? They're wrong. If you have an issue with it you can report it to the police.

&gt;And if yelling a particular phrase in the street is illegal, the same thing should also be illegal when posted to a public message board. 

If the phrase is illegal in real life then it's illegal on the internet just the same (under British law). If someone reports it and takes issue with it, they can press charges.

&gt;And if some sort of content is only to be distributed to adults in real life, then websites need to (somehow) meet those same expectations of checking ages. Otherwise all we have is double standards.

Anything which requires purchasing on the internet means you need to use a credit or debit card. These are only available to people who are 18+ (I think maybe 16+ even?). So that leaves free-to-access services like porn, which in terms of consumption is one of the most victim-free crimes possible. So basically, what is currently restricted will continue to be restricted by virtue of access to electronic payment, and everything else is free. There is no double standard.

How we do things now is absolutely fine, if somewhat draconian because of government's incestuous / corrupt relationship with BT. We should enforce laws that apply in real life just as much as online and if the laws are not enforced then they should be removed from statute.

I'm old enough to remember using BBS on my PROTEK 1200 ZX Spectrum modem. I miss the old internet but the current internet isn't bad either.

Freedom of speech is summed up quite nicely by the opening of the wikipedia article:

&gt; Freedom of speech is the political right to communicate one's opinions and ideas using one's body and property to anyone who is willing to receive them.

Couldn't that just be because there was a decrease in punters but the amount of sex workers stayed pretty consistent? If the punters are down by half, it'd make sense that the rapes are down by half too..

And the law put in place was to criminalize the buying of sex, not the selling of sex. So it makes sense that they'd see a reduction in clients. That doesn't really explain why some violence is up, while others is down.. Just food for thought. 

&gt;A contractual obligation to have sex for a specified amount of time constitutes an agreement to rape.

If it's an agreement, it's not rape. Simple. 

People agree to sex for all kinds of reasons. Some people like to go into a car park at night and wank off a stranger.. Some people like to suck a dick through a hole in a toilet cubical.. Some people like to put on masks at a party and fuck each other.

I appreciate that is one of the best players that we have seen in a long time at Anfield, and that he practically performed miracles last year. But i also believe that people on this sub either have very short memories or havent been fans for very long.

The Evra affair directly contributed to Kenny's sacking ( and i'm not saying that Kenny was blameless...he wasn't). Kenny is the epitome of a legend at Liverpool and he and the club stood by him to a fault. {People seem to forget that amount of abuse he got as a result of Suarez. Also, i have been less than impressed that he has said several negative things about LFC since he's left. For example, his comments a couple of weeks ago where he said that the club wouldn't have challenged last year without him (again, i am not doubting this but it doesnt need to be said, it's disrespectful to his former teammates, who coincidently have stood by him through all the shit).

Finally, Suarez should simply learn to say nice things about his time at Liverpool or shut the fuck up. He benefited as much as we did from the relationship and given the amount of craziness we had to put up with he should just bow out gracefully and be happy that he got his move away.

false,cubs314,num14,,"Perhaps I'm just trying to be positive but I think that it's better that we don't have a Bale type player who is smoke-screening the fact that there is A LOT of work to be done with this squad. We saw in the beginning of last year that AVB had no clue how to run that squad without Bale and we were lucky to salvage a 6th place finish. With Poch, we go back to square one and, despite the relative performance of the squad, you get the feeling that we are working more and more after every result. 

Our defense has been better this season, and our midfield anchors are starting to settle in. However, it is that attacking 3 that the fans want to see more from and who are ultimately the ones who will make the team look like they are playing attractive football (and hopefully produce the goals). This doesn't just happen overnight as you need to invest time and money, the latter of which we do not have that much of (compared to mega clubs). Therefore, we need to be patient and let Poch work with these talented players that we have. Yes, we can debate the inverted winger system, and if certain players are capable of playing in the system, but at the end of the day its something time will tell.

I trust Poch, I don't think he is as stubborn as AVB but he still needs time to continue to understand the squad. Yes, Lamela has been disappointing, but this is realistically his first actual season with the team. If he keeps working with Eriksen to develop a nice chemistry then we will see something dangerous.

We need a striker. Ade and Bobby are both not good enough, all of the teams above us (aside from maybe Hull) currently have way better strikers than we do and we can see how it is paying off for them. Kane is still young and I like what I see every time I watch him play. But if he is not going to get a serious run of games then we need to buy someone. 

Things will be alright guys, this season is crazy for everyone, we just seem to be getting the shit end of the stick right now but it is still relatively early. I can only imagine that the squad will improve when Walker comes back, and that little bit of pace and width will be nice.

Perhaps its time government accepted that adults should be free to listen to, watch, read about and say whatever they like and be allowed to remain  unidentified because being able to speak your mind on a controversial issue without fear of reprisal is an extremely valuable freedom. Just because some twat is not up to the responsibility that freedom allows you wish to deny that to everyone.

'Real life' or afk is a world where we are expected to refrain from expressing strong views about work, religion, politics, money, sex if not for legal reasons then for being polite or guarded and that is shit. Why do you think that we should throw that away online too. The internet is the idea place to find like minded people and exchange ideas. Just because you dont like some of them doesnt mean they should be stopped and just because some prude doesnt want her 14 year old son wanking himself into a frenzy doesnt mean the rest of us should be blocked from adult materials. 

The internet has many dark corners but the ones who are most likely to find them are the young teenage boys who have the time that the rest of us do not to hang out in the forums to get access and keep abridged of the latest tools and workarounds for whatever you put up to stop them. 

I for one am happy with double standards applying because I dont want my news sanitised into something that her next door wont right a letter about, I dont want to hear only the acceptable views in discussions, trolling can be valuable when it is used to make a point that otherwise could not be made.

As for the Doctor, the prevailing theory was that the 456 invasion was a fixed point in time. Now, however, we have a new and quite interesting perspective on the matter.

Spoilery speculation ahead:

.

.

.

.

We know the Twelfth Doctor vaguely recognizes his new face but can't place it or understand why he got it. As viewers, however, we recognize it as the face of both Caecilius from *The Fires of Pompeii* and Frobisher from *Torchwood: CoE*.

Despite his Time Lord instincts telling him that the man was fated to die, the Tenth Doctor allowed Donna to talk him into saving Caecilius and his family. As a direct result, Caecilius had descendants that he would not have had before.

One of those descendants was John Frobisher, who went on to play a pivotal role in events which deeply hurt a close friend of the Doctor's-- Jack Harkness. Because the Doctor had already irretrievably tangled the time lines around Frobisher, he was unable to intervene against the 456 without tearing reality (a situation nearly identical to the one surrounding Amy and Rory being trapped in Manhattan).

The Doctor now wears Caecilius' face as a reminder to himself of the unforeseen consequences of interfering with time.

I remember being at the Grand Canyon and literally not believing our guide who said he made his house (legally) from hay bales covered in concrete.  They all told me I need to get out of NYC more.  When I visited New Mexico, there were all kinds of adobe houses (which are beautiful) and even self-sufficient Earthships, which were made out of old tires and adobe.

But if you are in NY (and states like it), or anywhere near a hurricane prone area, a tornado prone area or an earthquake prone area, the regulations are VERY strict.  However, older structures do not always have to be upgraded.  As far as wooden buildings in a tornado, if reinforced metal joists are used, it is nearly as strong as brick.  Also, wooden houses do better in an earthquake because they can flex.

Of course, an F5 tornado will destroy anything, even iron frame construction.

I lived in London, and just found whenever there was a multifamily house, it had a tiny water heater that ran out in 5 minutes.  In my student housing, the hot water was great.

**5**.Having a manager who looked like Droopy Dog.

false,Fimmschig,null,null,"&gt;Obviously not, so why does it suddenly become rape when a penis and vagina get involved?

Because rape is coercive sex and cleaning drains is not sex? Because when somebody cleans drains, they're using their body as one of many tools, and it being a human body is fundamentally irrelevant to the goal of having drains cleaned. Whether it's a human body doing it is irrelevant because you didn't hire a body to be sexually abused by you, you hired whatever is capable of cleaning a drain, and would have hired a bottle of chemicals if it could replace the ""body"" you hired. Cleaning drains is not particularly harmful psychologically or physically because *you are not actually getting raped, you are only cleaning drains*.

Can you see any difference at all between these demands: ""Clean this drain by tomorrow or I will kill you"" and ""Suck my smelly dick while my 50-year-old buddy fucks you in the ass until we ejaculate on your face, by tomorrow or I will kill you"". Do you at all suppose that either of these things will be more harmful to you? Do you think a court would consider these things to be morally equivalent? Which one would you rather be forced into? Would you be happy to work for a bank that required you to get fucked by male customers as part of the job, and you would have to submit in order to have an income to pay rent with?

I am what? A woman should be ""allowed"" to sell sex in prostitution, just as somebody should be ""allowed"" to work 80 hours a week independently.

You have said that other economists cannot take into account diasporas and such, yet these new research papers (not opinions, so where they get that I have no idea) have done and as such have changed my way of looking at it. As new things are discovered, is it not worth to look at them? I would cite the papers but I'm on a boat in the middle of the sea without access to my copy so I'm afraid I cannot.

As for your point, I never stated that all immigrants did this. Once again you fail to see the whole picture. These were/are incidents that occurred due to the multiculturalist policy that was set in motion by Labour. To think anything else was deemed racist. And there are indeed things done badly by the indigenous but that's nothing to do with immigration, that's a law/policing thing.

As I have stated many times and you have ignored, if they have something good in their culture, why can we not take it and add it to the British culture? Integrate it and make it so that we have one really good culture instead of lots of separate cultures that breed the hate and racism that we are now seeing. How is that racist? To want to make one 'super-culture' without all the bits we find 'wrong' like forced marriage and female genital mutilation. No doubt you'll ignore this argument/statement once again though as it seems too much for you to comprehend.

Also, multiculturalism is left wing mantra, freedom of movement which is more right wing was something that came about before mass global immigration was a thing and so the cultural aspect was never thought of. And still isn't really as economists can't actually put figures on it and so just discount it, even though it's actually a real thing that affects people. See the problem with the general accepted theory that doesn't take into account all the facts? My guess will be no, even though you have previously mentioned that these things cannot be quantified.

Did I not say he was versatile and could play across the front 3 and as a number 10? Because I'm fairly certain I did.

&gt; transfermrkt says he has predominantly played left wing competitively

Firstly, I never said he doesn't play on the wing, I said he's a Striker and is versatile. I even made a point of Solanke being seen as the better of the two and Brown being the more versatile, which is why Brown gets played out of position. Secondly, transfermrkt isn't realiable, it's a database, nothing more. They don't have extensive knowledge and just use the information they can find, so because Brown started his first game in pre-season for us on the left, that's probably why he's down as a left winger. Just like United's Paddy McNair is down as a CB when he's actually a CM/CDM but nobody had heard of him till he started a game at CB this season.

Yup, nothing about the way we use computers has changed since 1990.

I don't think I implied that. I just stated what IS happening, not that I think it's a good idea.

&gt;Existing laws for harassment, counterfeiting and worse are fine and that's as far as it needs to go. If the problem is the police needing more resources to enforce existing laws then give it to them, don't write more laws that they can't enforce.

I presume neither of us are lawyers, but enforcement of existing laws is causing just the same debate as potential new laws. Look at the outrage generated by people saying mean things on twitter (which I agree is stupid to prosecute for btw). And people on reddit will complain about enforcement of existing laws just as much as they would complain about new laws.

&gt;It's not lawless at all, that is a total lie and a fabrication. People can be prosecuted for under existing laws. They are still doing illegal things and can still be caught and prosecuted if they are located inside the UK.

Get it on ebay while it can still get a decent price, it will drop in a matter of months.

the problem i ran into was the ebay fees. I followed a few different people selling the same thing. Look for the price they **sell** for not the price that people **ask**

i insisted on the listing that i would only send by recorded delivery, I listed at around Â£400 and Â£4 delivery cost.
[](http://i.imgur.com/6OhQ3ep.png)
It all went well, sold in less than a day. 

the problems i had were the fees, after listing fees and then the final paypal fees i think i lost about Â£40, i think i'd add an extra Â£20 to my asking price next time just to offset some of that.

The legislation is fine for what it sets out to achieve and is still an effective piece of legislation despite of it's age and the changes in technology because it focuses on behaviours and contexts rather than specific technologies, eg, unauthorised use of a computer system. You might want to read it before being flippant about it.

&gt;I presume neither of us are lawyers, but enforcement of existing laws is causing just the same debate as potential new laws. Look at the outrage generated by people saying mean things on twitter (which I agree is stupid to prosecute for btw). And people on reddit will complain about enforcement of existing laws just as much as they would complain about new laws.

I'm not a great fan of the existing laws because they're overly cloying (especially those used to punish idiots on Twitter), but at the same time they have kept up with the demands of preventing harassment and abuse in cyberspace when enforced. Not everyone is as computer savvy as you and I. They are there if you need them, which is fine. I imagine if I was on the receiving end of a doxx hate campaign from some misguided souls then I'd sure as hell want the law on my side.

&gt;ROFL. Of course it's fucking lawless. Almost nobody is prosecuted for anything. And I love the ""inside the UK"" weasel words as the end there. There's illegal stuff all over the internet - far more accessible and widespread than in the ""real' world. And if police actually started enforcing existing laws online reddit would fucking implode with outrage.

Repeating yourself doesn't make it true. If you're using the internet in the UK you're subject to it's laws, I don't see why that's difficult to understand. There are statistics for those charged with and found guilty of cybercrimes and the laws used freely available on the internet. These aren't weseal words, you are clearly detached from reality on this one. Interpol and various supranational bodies deal with international cyber crime. [A good example would be when the CryptoLocker guys got busted earlier this year.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker#Takedown_and_recovery_of_files)

&gt;Are you saying that abuse online doesn't exist?

No. Pack that strawman up.

&gt;Or that the internet does not foster extreme views, hate speech etc. 

And that one.

&gt;People don't have to be ""victims"". They can be willing participants - such as message boards used to plan terrorism, or distributing illegal content.

If they're willing participants then they can be found guilty of any number of crimes relating to the distribution of such material. The laws work, yes?

Older houses either have noiseless immersion heaters or a conventional boiler which would normally be programmed to heat up the hot water tank at night - so it would tend to be noisier and running for a long time. Also, they were frequently put in airing cupboards upstairs so the routing to a hot water tank in the attic was shorter. (hot water tanks are stored in attic to allow gravity to do the work of pulling it into taps, rather than having to try to pressurise the system and push it up and get really crappy water flow upstairs). This means they were *closer* to bedrooms.

However, on the flipside;

 a) this shouldn't be too much of a nuisance because the boiler should be located either in the kitchen or in a boiler cupboard, *away* from sleeping areas and

Went to study Archaeology in York, and by the middle of the second year I was suffering from severe depression and anxiety, and likewise having no friends or social ability. I used three special circumstances to extend some essay deadlines because I was feeling so shit, but unfortunately by January I couldn't face it anymore and asked to go on a leave of absence. A really tough choice. 

I was house sharing with a bunch of people at the time in a private house (and the people were mostly dicks which didn't help my mental health at all). I did a fairly stupid thing and got a separate bedsit room on a rolling monthly contract which was cheap, and used my student loans to fund it, and in essence moved out of the student houseshare while not officially leaving the contract. I wouldn't really recommend this, it did fuck up my finances a little.

After half a year of not getting any better, I formally dropped out.. which was a huge relief actually. I don't think I could have faced going back to Uni at that time.

Since then I had some intensive counselling with a free service provided by the Council, and got myself onto some medication. 

And then I started applying for apprenticeships. I was 22, and had to refuse getting a Certificate of Higher Education (which you get after completing one year of University, since a CertHE means you're ineligible for an apprenticeship). I got into a admin job with the Council.

Then I got diagnosed with autism/aspergers, which really helped bolster my self esteem (so I'm not just a shit person, there's a reason for it!)

I'm so much happier now. I officially haven't felt depression in two months, and I'm a lot more confident. I've gone from being practically unable to talk to people, to volunteering to man the public facing front desk! The job is fantastic, and there's a strong chance I'll be continuing on in the role after I ""graduate"". It's also opened up a bunch of opportunities and given me some great ideas on what to do with my life. The pay was a bit of a sticker (Â£740 a month is barely enough to live on..), but apart from that it's been the best thing I've ever done. Though your mileage may vary. 

I'd like to go to education someday, though I've pretty much used up my student loans and won't be able to get financial support in the future. I'm also being hounded by the Student Loans Company on Â£3000 of ""overpaid bursary/overpaid loan"" which they're demanding back. Keep that in mind. I'm ignoring them for now.

However, properly specced and designed, I would argue that timber framed or pre-fabricated homes are actually better than brick built.

Moreover, suburbia should not have a single road leading into it, that's just the effect of rather silly regulations prohibiting councils from redesignating the green belt. Hopefully that should change slowly.

The real reason we have no economy is due to globalisation and being part of a country that didn't give a fuck about how globalisation affected us.

Google and Microsoft license their OSs to a number of manufacturers. Due to this they can't tailor it like Apple can. Hypothetically a Â£50 Windows phone needs to be able to perform basic functions just as quickly and efficiently as their Â£500 just released flagship model.

Apple does absolutely amazing things with their hardware, but that's because they keep it exclusive to their own products and it doesn't stop the hardware itself being a few years out of date compared to competitors. 

I agree with you that the first iPhone was absolutely ground breaking, as was the first iPad. They both took things that hadn't really made it in the commercial market before and... Re-shaped them into a friendly, accessible and functional package. 

That was also true for the next few generations while Google was still getting Android out of the gate and Microsoft had it's fingers in it's ears. But since I think around the iPhone 4 every single iPhone has just felt like the same thing in a slightly different case, they seem to be playing catch up with other manufacturers now (Apple Maps anyone?) rather than coming up with new and inventive product lines. But it's a testament to those first few iPhones and the iPad that they're still selling just as well today. 

Apple's achievements are absolutely notable, their latest product line up is just a re-hash of last years.

   I'm pretty sure she's dead, and in The Nethersphere.
In fact, I think Missy orchestrated The Doctor's involvement in this episode. ""The Thoughts"" told Maebh to find The Doctor. She referred to this as thinking ""Miss (meaning Clara)"" told her to. It's seems entirely within Missy's sphere of power to implant these thoughts if Annabelle is in The Nethersphere.
  Unfortunately, since Who is perfectly comfortable with ludicrous coincidences, Annabelle's sudden appearance isn't very strong evidence for this theory, but the look she gives Maebh when she says, ""I Thought you'd be here!"" seemed more sinister than happy.

false,falcona14,river,River,"[Listen](http://realitiesunlimited.blogspot.ca/2014/09/listen.html)- 5 Fantastic episode that has bits of comedy and great mystery. I love to see stories or things that come full circle, the toy soldier did that perfectly, as did the leg getting grabbed. This also provides us with a huge insight to the Doctors early years of development. I think we'll find that that barn isn't on Gallifrey.  
[Mummy on the Orient Express](http://realitiesunlimited.blogspot.ca/2014/10/mummy-express.html)- 4 Mystery, space, reproduction of an older time, the Doctor bantering to solve a proplem, this is the Doctor Who show that I know and love. The Mummy, a perfect ancient foe as is Guss, or at least whoever is behind Guss. Missy?  
[Time Heist](http://realitiesunlimited.blogspot.ca/2014/09/time-heist.html)- 4 if you don't understand time loops and parapoxes, this one is going to confuse you. In my case I loved it. It was good to see the use of the Memory Worms again, not just a one-off Strax plot device.  
[The Caretaker](http://realitiesunlimited.blogspot.ca/2014/10/the-caketaker.html)- 4 The Doctor working at Coal Hill School, this is a 50-year-in-the-making full circle. The Doctor's granddaughter, and first companion, Susan attended Coal Hill in 1963 to learn about Humans. The unfortunate thing about this episode is that there was zero reference to that.  
[Deep Breath](http://realitiesunlimited.blogspot.ca/2014/08/deep-breath.html)- 4 The Dinosaur story seemed like a thow-away. The real story was the droids, and Missy. Its a long episode that seems to waste a lot of time getting to the real story. What was with Clara not getting that the Doctor changes? She's seen all of the Doctor's incarnations old and young, that was a wasted sub-story.  
Flatline- 3 Not a bad episode, just seemed... flat. I wasn't thrilled by this episode, except the bits of Clara trying to be the Doctor.  
Into the Dalek- 3 Underwhelming and lacking tension. People died, but you never felt this story was going anywhere but where it did.  
[Robot of Sherwood](http://realitiesunlimited.blogspot.ca/2014/09/robot-of-sherwood.html)- 3 Whimsical episode driven by the companion, great concept, poorly exicuted. There seemed to be more hidden in this episode than was revealed, but my score could change if it ends-up tying-in with the final.  
In The Forest of the Night- 2 A little girl who lost her sister is more intune with a hidden natural phenomenon than anyone else on the planet. On top of that the city of London, with 4.8Million citizens, grinds to a ghost town, when a forest invades. So many things in this episode that didn't ring true, what was with the sister reappearing at the end.  
[Kill the Moon](http://realitiesunlimited.blogspot.ca/2014/10/kill-moon.html)- 2 Single worst episode of the season. The moon is an egg, and humans have not known that for the millions of years that its been there, or in all the studying of it that we've done in the past 55ish years. Add to it, that egg has suddenly increased in mass, where did that mass come from? Also the lesson taught by the Doctor was extremely heavy handed, not what we're used to from him.

And okay, some of the stuff in this episode was fairly mediocre with a thin and blurred line between the science and fantasy, but it was sprinkled with some great throwbacks to past episodes too.

Maybe I just love fairy tales -- I have taught a class on fairy tales -- but taking this episode as a fairy tale made it a rather enjoyable romp which explored that fairy tale dread of the forest. There are books on this -- see Jean Hegland's *Into the Forest* for example.

Capaldi was entertaining and I think the episode showed a good extension of the Doctor's growth away from the ""Timelord Victorious."" We also had this growth shown in *Kill the Moon* where the Doctor is seemingly choosing to sit back and watch events unfold, more like a tourist to history than a savior of it.

This issue severely limits how Lamela can attack; opposing players realize how weak Dier is and are able to make more of an effort to slow Lamela down.

&gt;Bigotry is a state of mind where a person strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc. Some examples include personal beliefs, race, religion, national origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or other group characteristics.

Do I strongly dislike their ideas? Yeah, I suppose so. Do I *unfairly* dislike them? I would say absolutely not. Their views *are* nasty, and I defy anyone to say otherwise. A reasonable response to them is therefore to dislike them. I hold that their views are *very* nasty, and that it is therefore still reasonable to strongly dislike them.

I am *not* suggesting they should be silenced or locked up. Freedom of speech is freedom of speech and must be ensured. All I have done is attack them on the grounds that they unfairly attack those of other races (""bloody pakis, coming over here and taking our jobs,"" as a BNP splinter group like Britain First might very well say), nationalities (""bloody Poles, coming over here and taking our jobs"") and religions (""bloody Muslims, coming over here and taking our jobs"").

Maybe he's overconfident, maybe he isn't used to the league yet, maybe he doesn't see anyone around him getting open.  Whatever the reason, he ends up swarmed by players and losing the ball.  I think this is a problem that can be fixed with some coaching and time.  It would also be helped by a striker that can actually find space and move the ball around, but that is another discussion.

Two, he is so ridiculously one footed.  A flat out refusal to use his right leg is killing him.  Everyone always liked to talk about how Bale was one footed but the fact is he would hit crosses with his right when necessary, and even scored some fantastic goals with his right.  Lamela is like BAE in that his left is the only option, and I've long been a believer that on the wing that is rarely going to work.  Unless the player can compensate with an abundance of speed or is just an insane talent they are too one dimensional.  If Lamela gets the ball on the outside everyone knows what is about to happen because he can't take it down the side and put in a cross without cutting back to his left foot.  I don't think that can be fixed with coaching, but it could be fixed by moving him inside, maybe a little on the left coming in.  In the middle there is more space and more options so being one footed isn't as much of a hindrance.

I do not understand this overwhelming negativity toward Danny. He is an immensely patient and supportive partner to Clara. I think it is refreshing to see the writers portraying how a man can show genuine concern for someone that he cares about without being controlling. And he is *not* controlling. He just wants the truth, and while he suggests that it may be in Clara's better interest (for her own safety and sanity) to stop traveling with the Doctor, he never tries to force this issue, only speaks with perspective from his own experience.

I would also like to quote a large chunk from the most recent [AV Club review](http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/doctor-who-forest-night-210987) of this episode, which notes:
&gt;His wartime experiences lend crucial weight to the notion that he wants less to see new and wondrous things than to see the things in front of him more clearly. Itâs a well-balanced moment, as the scene doesnât overemphasize the conflict in Clara and Dannyâs views; Danny isnât arguing that Clara is wrong to want to travel with the Doctor, but instead just explaining why his own perspective is different. There is a straightforwardness to Dannyâs thinking that eludes Clara here: He knows what he wants from his life in a big-picture sense, and he knows that his immediate responsibility for the childrenâs safety overwhelms whatever curiosity or enchantment he might be feeling about Earthâs global reforestation crisis.

Of course Danny can't trust the Doctor and has a clashing relationship with him, the Doctor is an officer in his eyes -- the kind of man who put Danny into the situation that clearly haunts him. He just wants to find trust with Clara. I'd say that's a very well written character.",0,1414428042,null,0,false,0,cll8rc8,t3_2kbbud,t1_cll8rc8,t1_clk2x87,null,1426325668,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The characterization of 12 as someone who faces the world with a pragmatic and scientific outlook (monologue at the beginning) but who is still driven by his own emotions (""I HAVE TO KNOW"") was really well done. The deepening of Clara as a character by showing her deal with a real world situation an seeing her own awkwardness was great. The fact that Clara had to start her relationship with Danny by lying to him about the fact that she met him as a child as was indirectly responsible for him becoming a soldier and ending up with PTSD as an adult set up her whole arc with him this season. 

The interplay between 12 and Clara being in charge of each other ""do as you're told"" has been a major driving force behind Clara's Doctorification and 12's softening. Here we saw 12's intensity vs the way 11 would have acted and we saw Clara take on an almost maturnal role.

We also saw Clara's inability to ignore a crying child, furthering her initial ""maturnalness"" and  something which has changed over te course of the season as she has take. To manipulating the Doctor more and choosing death for other people. 

Last, we saw the clearest clashing between her Doctor life and normal life. This issue has been following her all season and set up all of her character moments in the Caretaker.

Unlike other Doctors content to travel and have fun but fight monsters when necessary, Listen sets up 12 as a Doctor who seeks out monsters to fight. This was furthered in him going to the Orient Express in the hope that there was a monster on board. It also fits with his characterization of himself as ""the man who fights the monsters"" in Flatline. This also plays into his confusion about his own ""goodness"" does a good man seek out these battles? Would a good man be so addicted to being an ""officer"" that he invents monsters and endangers his friends? 

This episode was the most dense in terms of character development and setting up conflict that we have ever gotten from the show. Everything in Listen has affected the entire rest of the season.

I'll try and summarise it basically...

Government system needs replacing/building for whatever reason. Specifications designed by people who are politicians and/or managers at whatever place needs the system. Specification sent out to tender to large IT firms. IT firms bid to deliver, one wins, contract finalised, signed, date for delivery set.

In the meantime, the project has changed in scope or scale. This can happen in a number of ways:

* The legislation is changed in a way that it affects more people. This could be that actually, instead of dealing with the records of 5 million people, it needs to deal with 50 million peoples data. The original specification for the system to be built didn't include dealing with this much data, and as a result it requires a lot more database optimisation, other work doing on it, to make sure that the system can cope with more people accessing it, etc.
* The legislation itself changes - a number of exceptions are brought in. Ie, the benefits will only be paid every other Tuesday to people with a dog who can stand on one leg in the job centre. Or, as announced today, benefits will only be paid to jobseekers after a week rather than after 3 days. As it stands, that probably wouldn't be a difficult change to make, but in some cases the changes to legislation mean a complete change to the software. This was again not provisioned by the specification, and the company can either delay the release/charge more money/etc.
* Someone didn't think of something that actually needed to be in it. Mr Civil Servant has decided that every 5th week he needs a report generating detailing some specific criteria, like the number of people who walk more than 500m to get the bus. The data is in the system, but someone needs to write a lot more code to get it into the form wanted.


This isn't to say that contractors don't mess up - of course they do. But government IT procurement is a mess, and nobody has learnt from their mistakes. These kinds of things have messed up for years and years and years.

&gt;

&gt;___City of Death___ is the second [serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [seventeenth season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(season_17\)) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, which depicts the adventures of a time-travelling humanoid alien known as the [Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)). It was produced by the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) and first broadcast in four weekly parts between 29 September 1979 and 20 October 1979 on [BBC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One). The serial was written by ""[David Agnew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Agnew)"" â a pseudonym for [David Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fisher_(writer\)), [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams), and [Graham Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Williams_(television_producer\)) â and directed by [Michael Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hayes_(director\)).

&gt;*City of Death* features the [Fourth Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Doctor) ([Tom Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Baker)) and his companion [Romana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana_(Doctor_Who\)) ([Lalla Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalla_Ward)). Set mainly in Paris in 1979, the plot concerns a scheme by an alien, Scaroth, to steal the *[Mona Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa)* to finance experiments in [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) in the hope of averting the accident that marooned him on Earth four hundred million years previously, which began the existence of life on the planet as well.

&gt;The serial's original storyline was devised by Fisher but was heavily re-written by [script editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_editor) Adams, aided by producer Williams. It was the first *Doctor Who* serial to [film on location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filming_location) outside of the United Kingdom; the production team worked in Paris during April and May 1979. The studio work was completed in June.

&gt;Broadcast during a strike that took [ITV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network\)) (the BBC's rival) off the air, *City of Death* scored high ratings. The fourth episode was watched by over sixteen million viewers, the highest UK television audience ever attained by an episode of *Doctor Who*. Although, in retrospect, it has been regarded as one of the best serials from *Doctor Who*â'âs classic run, the initial reception was not as positive, with criticism of the humorous tone.

I assume you mean ambiguity? The ""ambiguity"" in this episode only exists because the plot forces things to work in ways that make no sense. Why is the Doctor coming up with a dumb theory for no reason, and writing on the walls? Is he senile?

Why is a kid acting so bizarre? It's ridiculous. 

Why does a ""space ship"" have an automatic door opening procedure? How is that not like putting a screen door on a submarine?

&gt; the tension which proved to be nothing

I felt zero tension in this episode. Nothing. From the first time the Doctor says his theory, I thought it sounded like psuedo-science nonsense, and I was confused why the Doctor would make it up out of nothing. But I was suspended my disbelief because I was hoping to see a cool monster of the week, so I waited. And I waited. And I waited.

There's no tension if the monsters don't prove themselves to be a threat. If these ""perfect hiding"" monsters had existed everywhere since the dawn of time, why should we be afraid of them? They haven't hurt anyone, they've always been there. There's nothing scary about them.

To top that â¦ of all the talk about âkids come firstâ from Danny, he had no trouble being convinced by a group of kids to go out into a tree-filled London, with those kids, where god knows what is going on.

I was not a real big Clara fan. Didnât like the idea that she was the âimpossible girlâ, but this season seems to have given her more development and I like that. I really liked Danny in the beginning, but now he is really starting to wear thin. I get that he wants to focus on what is in front of him.

You've made me realise I need to brush up on my Unix skills, I'm far too used to easy distros such as Ubuntu where I believe uname -r works, which is what I was guilty of using most as it's what I know.

Had a quick read of the Solaris Containers stuff and it's quite an interesting way of doing things and is reminiscent of something like OpenVZ but seems to require even fewer resources. 

I think the ""it ain't broke, don't fix it"" approach is probably prevailing, and for what it needs to do, I'd imagine it's OK. It's never felt slow and flies through the basic compilation stuff we've done so far (I'm only a lowly first year).

I took a year out last year to do some volunteering abroad in Malta (funnily enough for my psychology module) but also to visit my dad and grandparents who live over there. My university did not really have any problems with me taking a year out as I'm getting some valuable experience. Now I'm in my third year and have no problems carrying on studies.
&gt; Also I'm 19, most apprenticeships seem to be aimed at 16-18 year olds, what's the story there?

Probably something to do with the fact that you have to be 18 to leave school now, so if some kids don't feel that A-levels are for them, they can do BTEC/Apprenticeship work instead.

&gt;how would I phrase in interviews and on my cv that I have a year's worth of uni under my belt but chose to take time out? Do I tell them I'm home for a year?

Yeah, exactly that. There is no problem telling them that you're having a year off. Tell them that you'd like some work experience. Write your expected graduation date (e.g. 2014 - 2017) as you would. It isn't their job to ask about that until an interview where you can explain things.
People take time off from things all the time. They aren't going to ask why you finished sixth form in 2013.

&gt; What's going to happen to my student finance? 

Don't change this until you know for sure you can take a year off. Once that is confirmed, then call student finance and ask about it. I applied as an international student anyway so I can't really help you.

&gt;Which brings me onto my house in my uni town. What do I do about the contract?

You'll have to ask the landlord / housing company. Normally if you can find someone to take over your contract you won't have a problem. If you can't, you may have to pay an early termination fee.

&gt;And what about when my housemates sign a house for next year?

That's up to you and your housemates. Do you want to still live with them? You could always try and find a shared house yourself next year if they've already sorted something out. Or find student accommodation and find new housemates. I dunno...

&gt;going to my local uni and having no friends because I'm a year older than other second years

Being a year older than everyone makes no difference. There are people taking my course who are in their 40s. Make friends by talking to people, your age doesn't even matter to them, especially not one year. A lot of people will be the same age as you still.

Sorry if my answers are vague. I'm really tired.

You poke someone in the chest, they move, it hits them in the boob, does that become sexual assault because they felt violated? 

I don't think how good or bad she felt about it afterwards when seeing a video is all that important. 

The whole thing is just odd. It's really on the cusp of what is sexual assault either way, except if it was her foot rather than her face I can't think of much less that might qualify.

EDIT: thought, if the girl he did not know, and had no idea how she would respond, had instead laughed about it loads and thought it was hilarious, should that change anything? His actions were absolutely identical either way.

In the reply you sent just now that was fine, I didn't feel things were heated and I respect that, I gave an option, If you have a source of reasonably priced, quickly available, quality replicas then you should post them for the original poster to follow up.  Us complaining whether a story that comes up on the wikis is either a rumour or fact doesn't add anything, who knows, perhaps another topic is better for that debate.

There's no citation on the wikis or TV tropes either, they're really should be.

&gt;__Richard I__ (8 September 1157 â 6 April 1199) was [King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_monarchs) of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England) from 6 July 1189 until his death. He also ruled as [Duke of Normandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Normandy) (as __Richard IV__), [Duke of Aquitaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Aquitaine), Duke of Gascony, Lord of [Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus), [Count of Poitiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_Poitiers), [Count of Anjou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_Anjou), [Count of Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_Maine), [Count of Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_Nantes), and Overlord of [Brittany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany) at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of King [Henry II of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England) and [Eleanor of Aquitaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine). He was known as __Richard CÅur de Lion__ or __Richard the Lionheart__ because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior.  The [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim) called him *Melek-Ric* (King Richard) or *Malek al-Inkitar* (King of England).  He was also known in [Occitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan) as __Oc e No__ (*Yes and No*), because of his reputation for terseness.
