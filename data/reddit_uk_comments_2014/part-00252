* The court heard Mr Collett addressed the gathering on the same evening. Mr Collett allegedly said: ""Let's show these ethnics the door in 2004.""

When Yedlin arrives there's almost no way he will usurp Naughton immediately. He's going to be coming off nine consecutive months of competitive play and will be asked for four more. It's in Spurs' best interest to let Yedlin rest and prepare himself for a far more physical league.

Additionally, we're tentatively scheduled to face Chelsea, Arse, and Liverpool as three of our first six league fixtures to begin 2015. While selling Naughton after Walker returns may seem like it's in our best interest for the winter window, I'd rather we keep a league-experienced player as squad depth, rather than hoping Yedlin can repeat his World Cup performances if he's needed.

After his two great starts, Dier may have already eclipsed Naughton as our backup RB, but he's also supposed to be one of our second-rotation CBs if one of our starting two (presumably Jan &amp; Fazio) get injured. In a season where we're hoping to make long runs in all three cup competitions, having that extra depth is especially important. Selling Naughton right now doesn't make any sense unless a mid-table team comes up with a offer that Levy can't refuse.

As for what's more likely, it's honestly a toss-up. On one hand, I can't see Naughton in lilywhite after next year's September deadline. By then Yedlin will have had sufficient time to acclimate himself in Europe and Naughton will have spent five years at Spurs as a squad rotation player and he deserves a shot to start at mid table. On the other, nobody really knows the details of the Yedlin transfer and whether Seattle has the option to get him back on loan until the summer of 2015.",0,1409216002,null,0,false,0,ck2nhgk,t3_2et0gd,t1_ck2nhgk,t3_2et0gd,null,1427320665,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

Here is the text of my post which was deleted:  

**Has anyone seen the C4 documentary about Muslim rape gangs in Bradford which the Police asked them not to show until after elections?**

It was called Edge of the city and claimed that ""Asian"" men in Bradford were targeting white girls as young as 11 for sex and drug abuse. It was made in 2004.

It features the mother of a 13-year-old girl who claims that her daughter was drugged and gang raped by Asian men in Keighley, West Yorkshire. 

The documentary was pulled from the schedules at the last minute by Channel 4 on the advice of West Yorkshire police, who feared it would stir up racial hatred ahead of the local and European elections on June 10. 

The BNP, who were contesting in the area then produced a 5 minute election broadcast based on the pulled documentary but Channel Five then pulled that too.

A BNP spokesman accused Channel Five of ""censorship"" and said that the party was being denied freedom of speech ""on the whims of the broadcasting companies"".

In the banned election broadcast, the West Yorkshire police are accused of ""politically correct censorship"" for asking Channel 4 not to show the original film.

Here's a radio segment about the documentary:

What I think may be a deflection is the focus by the press (notably the Telegraph, Mail and now Mirror) on the ""Asian"" angle, and the excuse by those involved that they didn't do anything because they would be labelled racist.

Which is deflecting from the fact that for over a decade the local police and council received at least 3 official reports that stated this widespread abuse was going on, and had many victims come to them, yet they did nothing. The new report mentions that some staff claimed to be afraid of being labelled racist, but that is just one sentence in paragraphs of failures by the authorities (police dismissing victims, the council setting up a committee that never did anything, dismissing reports because they didn't believe them etc.).

Child abuse involves several crimes, and many of those who committed it are already in prison. This report was supposed to be about the major failings of the local authorities - and was pretty damning - yet so far all that's happened is the chair of the council has resigned, and the PCC (who was partly 'responsible' for some of this stuff) has resigned from the Labour Party.

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"Part of the problem is that there is a lot of genuine prejudice and racism, under which legitimate claims get buried. 

Add to that the fact that any discussion about such issues will eventually attract people who, for whatever reason, just hate all muslims or are unable to  separate in the minds the actions of a specific group of people from those of an entire race or global religion. Then in turn they attract all the people who want to call everyone a racist and so on until everyone is distracted from the actual point.

There is a problem, as well, with articulation. While certain people may be perfectly correct in what they are saying, they do not know how to do so in an objective manner. The sentence: ""There are a bunch of Pakis in Rotherham who fuck kids!"" may have been technically accurate, but it's fairly clear why such a statement would be dismissed as racism. On the other side the response ""You're a racist"", is equally unhelpful. 

Hence, discussions involving Islam make a lot of people uncomfortable. They very rarely end in reasoned debate and almost always descend into loud ignorance on both sides. 

Those who have cried ""Muslim Wolf"" in the past have their own share of the blame in this problem, though not as large as those who were supposedly willing to ignore claims of abuse for the reasons asserted. 

Let's not forget, though, that the people mainly at fault are the dick-heads who thought it was OK to go about raping kids.

You can see they are pretty much neck and neck if you do a small-ish number of trades. Adding in a few random contributions probably sways it for iii.

Best of luck with your investing!

&gt; It seems to have a clear vision of its typical readers: a retired (or soon-to-be-retired) couple hankering for the Britain of the 1950s. They have more than a few aches and pains between them and worry about how they are going to finance their old age. Their home is their biggest asset, so they constantly check estate agents' windows and every market report to see if prices have recovered from the 2008 crash. They have a pension and find life on a fixed income tricky in this era of low interest rates. 

&gt; The Express couple are convinced that Europe and immigration are to blame for every ill in the country and they give thanks daily for our wonderful Queen and the delightful Wills and Kate. Harry's a bit of a handful, but he's learning. They are even coming to see Camilla as a good egg, though of course she can never replaced the sainted Diana. If they have a conversation with the neighbours, there is only one topic: the weather. They are unlikely to talk about the news because only the biggest events penetrate their cocoon.

I think one thing I've started to realise is that actually the UK is as much passenger as pilot in terms of where we're going - we suffered / are suffering in the 'great recession' because of a **global** financial crisis... but our living standards have increased exponentially since the 1950s due to **global** improvements in living standards. American ingenuity, Chinese manufacturing, Middle eastern oil have all changed the face of the world. The difference between France 2014 and UK 2014 is far smaller than if you compare either country to themselves 10 years ago. The more the world changes the more we all seem to become the same, play the same games, watch the same movies, enjoy the same hobbies, drive the same cars....

While each government will talk up how they have made Britain better, the real reason our slice of cake is getting bigger and more delicious is because the cake is getting bigger. The global economy is growing and continues to grow, and our fortunes are tied to that far far more than any domestic policies.

But that's not to say that everything is rosy, there are definitely unique challenges to the UK that we need to deal with. The frankly massive disparity in prices and earnings in different parts of the country, yet we still have single policies for important things such as education, health, joblessness, minimum wage, etc. - in Grimsby you could get by on an apprentice's wage (not comfortably, but still), in London you need to be earning over NMW to even afford rent. Do we need federalisation? Or is that just going to entrench the issues?

Additionally we have a big issue of wealth and houses. Houses have become a vehicle to put our wealth into and as such we have started creating deliberate scarcity to increase our wealth. We need a way for people to save their wealth that doesn't impair the housing market which should be as easy to enter and leave as possible. Imagine if we had the same situation with food, with everyone having a wheat silo lobbying to shut down the local farms because 'we don't need anymore wheat - it's just going to devalue our current stock' whilst the poorest go starving. That's the absurd situation we're in with housing.

The fact that a body hasn't been found, suggesting that Madeline is alive and out there, should really be reason enough for them to just forget about it, but no - ""nag nag nag, where's my child?"" 

I mean, kids eh? It's not as if parents should actually care about them or anything.

We have laughed at ourselves and enjoyed being laughed at. We never expected Britain to change to accommodate our religion - we didn't suddenly expect everywhere to be Kosher or close on a Saturday.

When Israel was attacked by Muslim countries, we didn't go round picketing Muslim businesses or smashing up Muslim shops. When Egypt or Libya kicked out thousands of Jews, we didn't track down Egyptians and Libyans in Britain and punish them in revenge. We didn't import old hatred and old grudges.

And so it depresses me that in Britain in the last 30 years we have imported vast amounts of anti-Semitism from across the Muslim world. We have given a home to people who believe that the actions of Israel mean that it's ok to persecute and hate Jews in Britain. And although it's childish and petty and doesn't make sense, part of me wants to turn to the young Muslims who are spouting anti-Semitic abuse and say: We were here first. We weren't causing any trouble. We were quietly getting on with our lives. 
So feel free to criticise Israel if you must. Feel free to march for Gaza demand justice. But we've been living peacefully here in Britain for centuries so leave us the fuck alone.",0,1409219298,null,0,false,0,ck2o2jo,t3_2esca2,t1_ck2o2jo,t3_2esca2,null,1427320392,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

So this guy is meant to be the best there is at controlling mobs and the most serious thing he's done in the last decade is help out with football hooligans? Please.

&gt;His ESRC research subsequently provided evidence that this ‘evidence based’ policing approach contributed to the low levels of violent confrontation during the tournament

In other news, sun hot, rain wet, pope catholic, etc. 

For shits and giggles I actually looked up the reccomendations he made towards police forces, and do you know what they were? When you get rid of the jargon, he basically says ""Don't be a dick to nonviolent protestors or crowds""

That's. It.

This is a bit of a long drop from a guy who claimed to be able to control motherfuckers who were straight-up rioting. Even if I believed this blatant self-promotion from a website owned by the people that employ him, that doesn't explain the chasm between aggraveted yet peaceful protestors (such as those displayed in the beginning of the video) and people burning shit to the ground and firing guns at police, such as in the recent Ferguson riots.

If the best this guy can come up with (and worse, the best YOU can come up with) is that being an asshole to people who outnumber the fuck out of you is a bad idea then frankly I think he ought to re-think his choice of career.

This adds very little credence to the theory that isn't his that you posted with the hopes of supporting a point that you can't support because you've been at yet unwilling to engage in even the most fundamental way. 

&gt;It's not my job to educate you though. If you can't bring yourself to believe that in certain circumstances it's just possible that a mob will behave rationally, and you don't want to look into it yourself, it's your problem. I just happened to be reading up on it for another reason so I thought I'd send it to you.

It's not my job to hunt sources in support of your point. I've given your approach every ounce of time and credibility I can BECAUSE it isn't my job to hunt for sources to support an argument I disagree with. You finally ante up a source and rather than help the guy it actually kind of makes him look like a huge bullshitter, and the above link doesn't much help.

Can I accept that crowds will sometimes act rationally? Sure. However, how rational you are is incredibly subjective, and we have a number of very irrational instincts that can come to the fore during mob gatherings or violent protests, and this man can do nothing about either of those despite his claims.

Not to mention, the core of this thread is about Islamic Extremists grouped into a mob and their behaviour therein. I don't know about you, but I don't think Islamic Extremists are known for being rational. That's why they're not called the Islamic Rationalists.

So even if I believe everything that Dr Stott says about Dr Stott, I think the argument is frankly invalid because we're not dealing with people who are rational in a way we wold expect even when not in a mob. 

&gt;Also, I genuinely don't understand your criticisms. It's a bit of a rambling mess.

It's called source dissection. You clearly want to sound smart, look it up.

&gt;And he works with our police quite often, particularly in relation to football crowds. Don't really know what the rest of your criticisms are, seem to have lost them amidst all the hilarious ""AW hells to the nos""

Again with the fucking football crowds. Pro-tip, if the best your boy can accomplish is to bring peace to a crowd that is by and large peaceful to begin with then he isn't a world leading expert in anything.

If you genuinely don't understand why I would examine your source and voice any criticisms, irregularities or straight-up lies that I find then you're honestly not qualified to partake in any exchange of ideas. I would expect you to do exactly the same to my sources (oh by the way my sources would be every riot from 2004 onwards globally, whereas before it was every riot from 2011 onwards globally, so thanks for that) and I wouldn't argue against the attempt, just the findings.

I don't know or particularly care how much you've interacted with the guy or how much he's interacted with your local bobbies but ask yourself this, this guy basically claims to be able to control crowds. Crowd gatherings in the past three weeks in America have resulted in widespread looting, arrests and injuries, over the course of two weeks and two days.

3. Keep all the interesting stuff on the front and keep it to max 2 sides A4.

4. Keep it plain as anything. No fancy formatting. Facts only. You're not writing a novel.

1. Who you are. ""Principal Know-it-all Architect with 15 Googleyears' experience"". Don't include your D.O.B - if anyone asks, tell them to fuck off. Your address on a single line.

2. List of skills and years' experience, two columns. If you're shit at something, put it down anyway, you can learn on the job.

Anyway the conclusion there was I think. Is there a problem .. well to an extent yes. There is meant to be some element of 'training of an elite' in certain insitutions and we'd hope that things like the NHS or Treasury were run by the 'elite'.

What's really an issue is nepotocracy. Where your position and power in society is defined by who you know, not your skill set.

Does Britian have a problem with this, sure. Oxbridge - yeap, that's the thing.

However, we also seem to be far more obessed with it than anywhere else.

And its hard to peel apart the people who went to these place and got smart out of it, and thus, have a position vs. the people who simply got the position becuase of friendly relation with people who previously had the position.

Historically massive problem, today you have a lot of improvements in the Civil service, for example with some pretty stringent anti-nepotocracy stuff. I once got 'lolnogetouted' despite being qualified for a scotish govt role (really fucked me over actually) becuase my mate allready worked there and was honest about it. 

So steps, right direction. Sure. Still problems, sure. 100% metriotracic society realistically possile given how people favour people they know as a natural pattern of behavior. Probs not.

But, and I think the report misses this out, compared to other major nations we are doing ok.

I am kind and only ask for half a months rent as deposit - ended up with a psychotic lodger who flat out refused to pay me and didn't see why he should, refused to move out and expected his deposit to be given back to him. 

I had to get my Dad involved (he didn't want to listen to a woman like me!), I didn't feel safe in my own home, I had to have people come over to make sure he actually moved out. And I never got the full rent so I had to scrimp for that month to cover all the bills on my own. I was lucky he didn't damage anything although I nearly had to pay to get the locks for the whole house (4 doors!) changed.

&gt; This man obviously is scared. He's scared because he doesn't understand what's happening, he's scared because the areas round him is changing. 

Even by the standards of the time this man’s views were quite shocking which is why Powell talks about the reaction he will get. There's no way of knowing why his fears about Blacks were so out of proportion and Powell isn't advocating explaining anything to him. He wants Blacks to be repatriated and for it to be legal to discriminate against the ones who remain here.

His patronising attitude is that while he himself isn’t racist the average man in the street will always resent the Blacks and the rapid change in attitudes towards race has proved him wrong.

&gt; She leaves her house and she is harrased and abused by a certain group of people, it wouldn't be illogical that if this continued to happen, like it seems to have done she would refuse these people entry into her home, or lodgings altogether.

You are making up with excuses to explain why she is a racist too. Your story seems very unlikely. He said she never accepted immigrants in her guesthouse not that she stopped after they started treated her badly. 
Like him, you automatically accept everything she says and it doesn’t occur to you racists aren’t always a reliable source for what Blacks are like.

&gt; No he doesn't.

In your own link he describes the first man as “a decent  ordinary fellow Englishman” and is full of praise for the second lady saying how “she worked hard”, etc.


&gt; I believe he said I haven't a doubt it was true

Your point? If someone asks “How do you know it’s true?” and you keep replying  “I haven’t a doubt it’s true”, it is a blatantly obvious deflection.

&gt; and that it was given to him by a reliable source

And when Frost pressed him on what he meant by it being a reliable he deflect that question too by saying it’s reliable in the sense he knows it’s true and how he refuses to say who the woman is even though he’s not being asked to say who the woman is.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKPze0dRgW8

Anyway a few years ago, the BBC found a woman who they are fairly sure was the woman he was talking about and the picture she painted was mostly wrong. As far as we can tell, her black neighbours were actually very friendly to her.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007737v

&gt; The situation was obviously common enough so that Powell could gain the support of up to 74% of the nation.

Most of the people in the UK at the time would have little contact with Blacks and would have believed what the woman said because they had little reason to doubt it, in the same way today that people are most likely to be concerned about immigration if they have little contact with immigrants.",0,1409223230,null,0,false,0,ck2oswv,t3_2erelx,t1_ck2oswv,t1_ck2e6f4,null,1427320050,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

There are two ways to react to this:

But if I do it in the name of Islam, I'm allowed to do so and if I do so in the name of Christianity I'm often *actively praised* for it and given positions of power!

This isn't right. This isn't mentally healthy. Why are we actively encouraging something that frankly divorces people from reality and drives them to killing others or each other. It's either the Muslims blowing up trains or the Christians killing gays. It's either Muslims taking over Schools or Christians changing the law to make it harder to legally control your fertility (and interestingly enough, vice versa).

Here's an idea, lets start treating the religious like the mentally ill people they are? These people are seriously mentally ill and this mental illness is one which drives them to spread their illness. These people need help.

A few thoughts initially - the Conservative Chief Whip has to move a motion in Parliament once it returns from recess next week. The by-election then has to take place between 21-27 days of the motion being passed. This is particularly important in this case given the Tory Conference takes place at the end of September which could potentially be in danger (danger for the Tories that is) of being overshadowed.


So it seems likely that the party will drag its heels on calling the by-election in order for Conference to take place well ahead of the vote.



Also interesting is the media battle that has been going on between UKIP and the Tories, in particular Boris. Each of their announcements (Boris standing, Boris choosing a seat, Farage doing the same) has been deliberately timed to sabotage media coverage of the other party's story. Unless the Tories throw Boris at Clacton, it looks like UKIP have won that skirmish.



As I noted below, it's also quite amusing that after so much speculation about whether we'll have a UKIP MP following 2015 (including from me), the best chance now looks that we'll have one before then.

CO received a tip regarding the blue wash over the original grey finish, and somehow they managed to botch the whole job, winding up with a toothpaste sonic instead.

I've seen emails from CO regarding the finish, and their explanation is completely unfounded and based entirely on hearsay and fiction. 

""The original 9th Doctors screwdriver was in fact blue, however this quickly got dirty and on screen appeared to be very grey.""

And, as you said, the interest groups and corruption played a part - as New Labour climbed into bed with the money men and threw out Clause 4 and any pretentions at being a socialist party, politically correct stances such as gay rights etc were a convenient way of rallying the troops for the cause without alienating their new sponsors.

Do you necessarily have a source on that?

I know the media are in full-on moralising, finger-pointing mode and demanding a scapegoat be found, but bear in mind that (while I have no love for the police as an institution) sex crimes are usually incredibly hard to investigate and prove because there's often so little in the way of hard evidence beyond unsubstantiated ""he-said/she-said"" hearsay.

Certainly it doesn't seem *good* that (apparently) repeated allegations over the course of 16 years didn't result in more results sooner, but we don't know anything about the context, details or prevailing political/community climate, so it's all too easy to point fingers and demand someone must have been incompetent merely because something bad happened and we emotionally demand a scapegoat.",0,1409226848,null,0,false,0,ck2pmyo,t3_2ero12,t1_ck2pmyo,t1_ck2o09g,null,1427319660,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.” 

For years, the police failed to get a grip of the problem, dismissing many of the victims as “out of control” or as “undesirables” who were not worthy of police protection. 

Concerns about damage to community cohesion were put above the need to protect the vulnerable, the report said.

[Here is an article that more or less explains this issue](http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2012/dec/05/state-independent-sector-teaching-differences).


About your bell curve argument I somewhat disagree, I think it's actually very much skewed towards the higher grade. You can see this in the proportions of the students getting which grades, and to be honest it kind of shows in classes too. [Here is a Wiki link on the grade distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education).

I like them **because** it provides with a sort of reading list of everything which is relevant from yesterday/this past week. If I am on reddit then usually only a few articles will make it to the top of a given news subreddit per day, and that news selection can be very lop sided. And if I go on the BBC News/Economist/Guardian website then the problem is that the site keeps bloody moving around. By the time I've finished all the stories in the Europe/Politics/Business section, then they've already moved the stories out that I've read and replaced them with new ones.

In a newspaper it's all just there. It's a finished product. I know how much news is in there, and I know that they are taking a synoptic overview of the entire day, rather than being influenced by whatever happens to be going on in Twitter at that specific moment. I can read the whole thing (or usually two whole things, one from either side of the political spectrum) and then fell ""informed"". In contrast, if I spend a while on the Economist website and and the INYT website, A) I will never actually ""finish"" reading either side because they keep changing it and B) the some relevant stories will pop up and pop down again before I get a chance or without me noticing them.

Online news is better, but I don't like it's constantly changing format. I know that ""news"" needs to be ""new"" but I don't mind waiting a little bit so that you'll stop fucking with it and just let it me and call it done, so you stop changing it whilst I'm looking at it.

By doing this, assuming he wins, it becomes a much more important victory, and makes them look much more popular.

That's why the Tories should have refused to fight the seat.  If they try to win and fail it makes Cameron look weak and legitimises the UKIP victory; if they take the same approach as Labour did when David Davis forced a by-election and refuse to field a candidate they only lose one MP (which doesn't matter this close to an election) and can always say the result is not a judgment by the electorate on Cameron.

There is a difference with Carswell changing parties, but the Tories are on shaky ground: they either field a big-hitter candidate and risk an embarrassing loss, or they field a non-entity and guarantee a loss.

Also - what seems to be lost is how gut wrenching this is for many Tory members. Carswell is very well respected in the party and was thought of as potential leader material down the line.

I think if you're from a working class background, going to a state school, its a lot harder to get into Oxbridge and even vaguely good unis, on average/overall compared to kids that have gone to private schools (again, in general, not every single private school is better than every single state school).

I'm perhaps a little bit not representative because I come from quite a rough area, but still; my point is that private schools have the...infrastructure, I guess, around the kid who's trying to get good grades and get through interviews and get into university. The teachers know what language to use, can give you the skills etc to prep yourself so that you can get into university past the 'gatekeepers', so to speak.

Its not as if all you need is grades to get into uni, you have to do all the application forms and write the personal statement and all that stuff, and at the end of the day, maybe little Franklin who's done viola lessons since the age of 4 and did work experience in his mum's science engineering company and goes twice a year on international skiing holidays will have more to put in that than wee Jimmy who goes to school and hangs out with his pals and goes to youth club on a Saturday night.

Careers advice at my high school was atrocious and a bunch of people had to resit their final year because careers didnt properly inform them how to apply for UCAS and a lot of people had only applied for universities that required top grades.

This whole topic just reminds me of how (sorry, I can't think of a better word for it) *privilege* is invisible to many people because you don't realise you have it - much in the same way you don't necessarily realise you're comparatively poor until you see how much free cash some people have. People that have been through the state school system can be a lot less familiar with the language used with application forms, how to make the best of yourself, and how to conduct yourself in an academic interview - not to mention being able to travel to one - and so due to these factors are selling themselves short, not just purely academic-achievement and intelligence-based ones.",0,1409229053,null,0,false,0,ck2q9jg,t3_2et3l4,t1_ck2q9jg,t1_ck2o7l4,null,1427319369,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Premier League Rule A.1.181:

“Under 21 Player” means a Player under the age of 21 as at the 1st January in the year in which the Season concerned commences (i.e. for Season 2013/14 born on or after 1st January 1992);

Current list:

1. Lloris
2. Vorm
3. Friedel
4. Kaboul
5. Vertonghen
6. Chiriches
7. Paulinho
8. Sandro
9. Dembele
10. Holtby
11. Capoue
12. Chadli
13. Adebayor
14. Soldado
15. Lamela
16. Eriksen
17. Fazio

As an aside, Schneiderlin signed for Southampton when he was 19 (d.o.b 8/11/89) in June. There are were only 17 mths before his 21st birthday so there is no way he can qualify as home grown.

Looking at the list again today, quite possible that Kaboul will be sold. It is a mystery to me what Poch makes of the Brazilians. Neither of them seem a direct replacement for Capoue (Sandro is more of a tackle and lay-off player while Paulinho is box to box + arrives late to score). Neither looks a replacement for Bentaleb either - although Sandro's game looks the most similar. We've also got Dembele - who is a better passer and tackler than both of them. If its purely financial decision then Sandro has gotta go, his relatively cheap transfer (£8m) plus age (25) means he has the greatest resale.

1. That's what I'm asking about - are you saying to open a bank account with a US bank, instead of an Dollar account with a British/European bank? If so, I've never opened an account with an American bank, but wouldn't I actually have to be in the US to do so?

2. What I'm trying to avoid is changing my USD into GBP at the moment, USD/GBP is fairly weak.

3. It's already going from a USD account into a GBP account, but it's just coming FROM an account that isn't mine.

I dunno if I just don't understand you, but I'm unsure about how this would be any different than what I'm already doing, aside from having to manually send it from a USD account to my GBP account every month, instead of it being done by the company.

Also, I'm not sure how keeping money in a currency I'm not using is gambling, simply for the fact I'm not using it. 

Expecting the strength of the currency to increase in strength/weaken in future and holding it for that reason would be ""gambling"", as you put it, but I really don't understand your reasoning that because I'm not using it, it's gambling.

I'm not contracting unfortunately (or fortunately), and it's a salaried position. I mentioned it's a salary in the OP, and that the company offered to pay me in pounds, but wouldn't meet my requests (as it seems like a lot more money for them, since it's costing them in dollars)

I recently met a Greek guy who's moved here to open a business who said to me that his entire economics class from one of the best universities in Greece had moved here. Just about anyone who can speak English and is educated in Greece is coming here.

Do you have any idea how many businesses want to come here because of how strong the talent pool is?

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"Hodgson has 2 years to build style and team that can challenge. If he was a great manager he would have picked style and system that fits the players he has, but he hasn't shown to prepare well. There are managers who would leave very good players because lesser players fit their system, and some even changing the style if a player vital to it got injured.

In the World Cup we saw Shaw, Sterling, Barkley, Lallana, Lambert all who combined probably just about scratched double digit games. Half who would be considered important to the squad.


What happens if such a group comes again right before the next Euros? He had a player in Gerrard who enabled him to play 3 man midfield but decided against it. Now he has to play 2 man midfield in 4231 probably, the only problem is that Hendo is average to useless in 2 man midfield where he has 50% of the defensive work and 50% of the creativity when in 3 man midfield he lets the other 2 take the creative and defensive work while he plays box to box, assisting in some games, defending in others. depending on the opponents.


Now Roy might be clever and just go with a system that works decently, one that will get him semi and maybe luck into a final, just play your best players in their best positions. This would still be massively hampered by Rooney unless he gets into bad form 2016. Rooney and Sturridge should not start in the same game. If they do, he needs to shift to a formation that fits 2 strikers and order Rooney to stay up top. Lallana is good now and should peak when he is about 27-28, so perfect for Euros. Sterling in just going to get better and better hopefully.


Either Wilshere needs to get back to his best, or Barkley will have to become more than explosive player who scores some times, i.e more tactically disciplined, help tracking back etc. There is a need for cover, Gerrard, Lampard, Milner, Barry/Carrick and many more are gone. He will get his cover from the likes of Colback and Delph who might get in the same form as this years English debutantes.

The drive west is pretty straightforward on the motorway (M4), but once you get closer to the destination (off the motorway) having a SatNav/GPS will probably be useful. Rental cars sometimes offer those (for a bit extra cash) if you don't have your own (or if yours doesn't cover the UK).

The Channel Tunnel [has significant safety regulations for trains above and beyond any normal UK/French rail standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurotunnel_Shuttle#Safety). Any train in the tunnel - Shuttle, Eurostar, or otherwise - is required to be manned by two drivers, one in a locomotive at each end. The train must be capable of splitting in half so that if the tunnel is blocked or damaged, half the train can be driven out to safety carrying all passengers. Each locomotive must be powerful enough to do this alone without its counterpart on the steepest sections of the tunnel. There are even minimum acceleration standards for how rapidly it must be capable of acheiving this.

Compare that to motorways, where people frequently die due to user error.

So, I don't know how well many of you remember those dark days, but we were not even expected to beat Arsenal, let alone whip them 3-0. And Robbie, while a rising star, was not yet recognised by all as the phenomenon he became.

The night before the game, a bunch of my friends and I were out at a bar, and while in the queue for the urinals I spotted a guy with a 9 Fowler shirt on. So I said to him the usual ""all set for the game tomorrow"" or whatever, and I also said ""3-0, Robbie Fowler hat-trick"". Well something just clicked in me, and this got locked into my brain. I said it to anyone and everyone when the topic of tomorrow's big game came up.

Later that night, me and my (Liverpool-supporting) friends got a taxi home and the cabbie happened to be an Arsenal fan. I was sat in the front passenger seat and I put forward to him my prediction for the game and he was having none of it (can't blame him).

But this merely increased my determination to back my prediction. I even remember going so far as saying ""Tomorrow at full time, you'll be thinking to yourself - 'My jaysus, who the hell was that guy in the cab last night?!?!' "".

The next day were were all watching the game - and I was not supposed to be drinking as I was working later. Fully aware of my prediction, when the first went in I went mad, when the second went in I went to the bar, and the third went in while I was still queueing!

I decided to celebrate and got drunk, later that day I went into work hammered and quit. Consummate professional, me!",0,1409231502,null,0,false,0,ck2r2nh,t3_2et37s,t1_ck2r2nh,t3_2et37s,null,1427318991,23,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,23

The one point Carswell did make that should resonate with everyone is that the polticians are increasingly locked in to their own reality and seem to have stopped listening to the electorate. 

At some point, probably shortly after Blair came to power, there has been the realisation that the point of the electorate is not to be won around to new ideologies or ways of changing society for the better it is to appear slightly less crap than the opposition and get in to power. Once in power do what you like.

I know my friends who are doctors who all got AAA at A-level and only got one offer. This guy got four offers from four medical schools. He must have had amazing grades, plus good work experience, plus excellent interview skills. Hard-working, intelligence, eloquent, and keen enough to convince interview panels to accept him. He's hardly some disenfranchised no-hoper with nothing else to turn to.

Many ISIS members are married too, and have families. Again, not exactly no-hopers with nothing to lose.

And again, if you look at the actual terrorists who have carried out attacks here, they were highly educated professionals. Glasgow attacks involved a doctor and another guy with a PhD in engineering.

I did make a post though that had lots of articles speaking about like I said, ''how will they deal with losing him'' or ''how can they replace him??'' and how imperative it was that they did, asap. i also backed that up with his stats at Schalke and they are pretty impressive too - to the point that I feel if he consistently played AMC he *could potentially* have an impact like Eriksen. I'd dig the post out again, but it would probably bore people so I won't. 

Basically I see it as Schalkes 10, German u21 captain, AMC. Moved to CM, isn't right for CM (doesn't have the discipline to stick to position &amp; press for 90 minutes from there, not imposing enough either and can't use his quick thinking and agility there), loaned to Fulham, now he has this tarnished reputation. Even so, he's had moments of magic [this fucking assist vs Utd for Fulham](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ufAdAxMQF2Q/Uveq728R0iI/AAAAAAAABjk/4K6j6ddFbpY/s0/09-02-2014-GifNumber-135.gif) and seemed to be building a little duo with Lamela in the Villa game back before Lamelas final injury. 

I genuinely feel he would be the perfect player in Poch's system - he's be pressing controlled from the front at AMC (so, the immediate CB's and DM's) not tiring himself out and his vision/passing/technique is up there with anyone. 

[This assist to Defoe, from other angles it looks incredible. Perfectly weighted, from a central AMC position](http://i.minus.com/iIc9eoRnskwVz.gif)

[Another great run, and lovely ball to Defoe](http://i.minus.com/iDQixzdbuYZzq.gif)

I could be here all day with Schalke moments too - if Eriksen did any of this, we'd cream ourselves. Holtby was doing it in arguably a tougher league compared to Eriksen too. I'm not saying he's better than Eriksen, not AT ALL - but he can have a similar impact and I'm standing by that.

Playing two left footed center backs would be a mistake.

Let's see some of the other things he was talking about, and the context of the ""rape gangs"" in this speech.

&gt;The leader of the British National party, Nick Griffin, told a crowd that white society had turned into a multiracial hell hole, a court heard today.

Interesting. ""Multicultural hell hole"". Do you agree with this statement?

&gt;Mr Griffin claimed that Asian Muslims were trying to conquer the UK, Leeds crown court heard. In a videotape shown to the court, the BNP leader described Islam as a ""wicked, vicious faith"". 

Do you also agree with ""Asian muslims were trying to conquer the UK""?

&gt;Mr Jameson said Mr Griffin's speech then turned to allegations of violence by Asian Muslims against whites. The QC said Mr Griffin said: ""These 18, 19, and 25-year-old Asian Muslims are seducing and raping white girls in this town right now.""

Speaking to the people I have done they are incredibly excited about the prospects of cities like Newcastle (manufacturing) and the west midlands (education). Furthermore Liverpool and Manchester are starting to meaningfully 'steal' jobs from London in the Accounting, Legal and Insurance sectors. This is a good thing for the balance of the economy.

That's why I was quite surprised by how poor a lot of the effects in this episode are. The dinosaur, the Half-Face Man and the London shots are very good. These effects seemed to have been helmed by Milk FX, who also did [*The Day of the Doctor.*](http://vimeo.com/80370941) But the green screen is painfully obvious when the Doctor is on the rooftops. When the Doctor fainted at the beginning, the shot stuck out like a sore thumb, as they used a higher frame rate to make the sequence slightly slow-mo.  Also, the TARDIS in the title sequence looks like a toy. I am wondering if, perhaps, a different company was responsible for the crumbier effects, as the work Milk has done has been pretty impressive.

Yet apparently this country STILL hasn't done enough for you, apart from investing £100,000's into your health, education and wellbeing and giving you the opportunity to get a PhD here.

The US is hardly ""less Orwellian"" either, since they have armed police kicking in your door, more widespread corruption, bought politicians (""lobbying"") and the NSA are joint partners with GCHQ so those two are basically the same.

Literally all you have done in your entire life is take things. You've sucked up money, and time and resources. 

But all of that isn't enough apparently, so the first thing you will do is take your free education and the skills you got here to somewhere else. You do realise that being born in the UK makes you incredibly lucky, right? Sure, you can cherry pick some examples of better places, but the UK is hardly a bad place to be from.

Hopefully this latest change will trigger further reactions.

Your line of thought is fallacious. You are denying that generalizations about groups of people can be ever be made. 

Contempt for the non-believers was the base of this crime wave. These were men, who were taught in their religious education to have racist hate and contempt for Westerners. Their rapes were both satisfying their sexual urge AND their hateful wish to humiliate their religious enemies.

Then again, look at what happened  in Traken, he stole another body getting himself one extra life, but hs still did not have regenerations. Somehow he miraculously survives getting incinerated on Sarn (still never explained that), and then last we see of Ainley he's turning into a Cheetah person.

Next step he's executed by the Daleks and the Doctors gets to take his remains home (why???), then the sludge that is his remains possesses Eric Roberts (god we need him to come back and do more, great villain potential) and he get's sucked into the Eye of Harmony. So, how the hell do the Time Lord's resurrect him for the time war, more importantly how do they do it without the Doctor knowing?

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"A lot of those figures come from sources which are hardly reliable. The public might be wrong, but I wouldn't trust all the figures presented either. 

For example:

&gt;-  Crime: some 58 per cent of people do not believe crime is falling, when the Crime Survey for England and Wales shows that incidents of crime were 19 per cent lower in 2012 than in 2006/07 and 53 per cent lower than in 1995. Some 51 per cent think violent crime is rising, when it has fallen from almost 2.5 million incidents in 2006/07 to under 2 million in 2012.

Crime may be falling, but we al know just how unreliable the police can be in recording an investigating crime. You'd have trouble finding any reliable statistics on crime, so I think its a bit unfair to say the British public is outright wrong about it. 

**Edit:** For everyone saying that the crime survey does not use police records, and so is more accurate, from their website:

&gt;The Crime Survey for England and Wales measures the extent of crime in England and Wales by asking people whether they have experienced any crime in the past year. 

So how accurate do you think this survey will be on things like domestic violence and sexual abuse, where the victim is unwilling to come forward and admit to what had happened?

There are no completely accurate figures for crime for this reason, so is it really fair to say that the public ""Know fuck all"", about crime, when in reality nobody knows the truth.

He has lost a step or two and has issues staying healthy. By most accounts last season at QPR he was average and that was at the Championship level not a top 6 in the PL level.

Harry (as big a BAE supporter as there is) came out last season and said that BAE wasn't the footballer that he used to be and it speaks volumes that this summer with no LB at QPR and no doubt Spurs willing to give BAE away he still had no interest in bringing him back.

&gt;In her 2006 report, she stated that 'it is believed by a number of workers that one of the difficulties that prevent this issue [CSE] being dealt with effectively is the ethnicity of the main perpetrators'

&gt;Several people interviewed expressed the general view that ethnic considerations had influenced the policy response of the Council and the Police, rather than in individual cases. One example was given by the Risky Business project Manager (1997- 2012) who reported that she was told not to refer to the ethnic origins of perpetrators when carrying out training. Other staff in children’s social care said that when writing reports on CSE cases, they were advised by their managers to be cautious about referring to the ethnicity of the perpetrators

&gt;Those who had involvement in CSE were acutely aware of these issues and recalled a general nervousness in the earlier years about discussing them, for fear of being thought racist. 

it's also worth noting that the police demanded that channel 4 censor a documentary about this type of abuse in Bradford back in 2004, for ""fears of increasing community tension"". This looks incredibly sinister now reading it today.

The actions of those who join ISIS are inexcusable, morally repugnant and undeniably criminal. Nor am I saying they are always ""no hopers"" with ""nothing else to live for"" in an objective sense, merely that they perceive disenfranchisement or have otherwise alienated themselves from the reality most people inhabit. 

I was quite a high achiever as well when I turned to nihilistic impulses/desires and found myself drawn to charismatic/rebellious and dangerous individuals. Dangerous thoughts, feelings and ideologies can exist regardless of one's social status (as perceived by others). 

&gt; a religion which encourages them 

Nothing unique about holy war and there's *especially* nothing unique about the militant passages of the Quran. Terrible atrocities have been carried out the world over and ""legitimised"" by the religion of those who committed them (even Buddhism). Given that almost 25% of the world's population is Muslim and that the overwhelming majority aren't engaged in jihad, I think it's perfectly reasonable to assume there's underlying psychological conditions that separates those who live as extremists from all the other ways in which Muslims go about their lives.

Thanks! Have you got any suggestions for a Dollar account in the UK then?

Like I said, I'm not expecting to make massive interest on it or anything, I just want a fairly simple account to hold my money in, and to be able to change it. The only recommendation I've had so far was for citibank, but a quick google suggests they crush you with poor exchange rates when you do need to exchange it.

If it matters, my main banks are RBS and Santander; but I'm happy to open another one somewhere else.

The purpose of CiF is to allow people to air a variety of sometimes controversial views, and whilst more editorial control could be exercised, CiF is not supposed to represent the paper's editorial line.

Were I the Guardian, I would spin off CiF as a microsite 'Powered by The Guardian' or something of that nature, amp up the discussion features (sentence tagging/annotation by guests with collapsible comment/response trees, maybe?), and selling the discussion as a real 'free speech zone' reddit-style whilst still choosing what articles go up there to keep it broadly appealing to the Guardian's demographic. What would also be nice is a greater sense of continuity. Articles are often responses to previous articles, and whilst a hyperlink essentially does the job of linking them, it's a blunt tool which doesn't allow selection of particular points or making a discussion 'chain' easier to find. Also, CiF could use the comments to help find potential future contributors.

Personally i have never had any problems with cyclists on the raod whilst I'm driving a vehicle.  Just go round them and leave plenty of space? not difficult in my opinion.
Also, I find cyclists are just as bad as normal drivers most are fine, but some are arrognat twats and take up too much of the road.

This of course is all irrelevant when it comes to guide dogs. Cyclists need to show some responsibility and common sense also. If you were jogging or running, would it be ok to bum into a guide dog? I don't think so.

Everyone has equal rights to use th road, I also think it's resonable for a cyclist to temperrlily mount the pavement in awkward situations or where blockages and congestion may occure. that doesn;t mean they can mow down pedestrians, it means you can use the path when it safer for everyone.. not just yourself.

The problem is not cyclists, pedestrians are car drivers, it's fucking idiots who have a selfish ""ME"" attitude, and then go about being a fucking dick. Motorcyclists are well known for this also.

I remember standing outside ahospital in a large UK city. the traffic was busy at 14:30. a motor cyclist ""lane hopped"" and deciced to jump the que by driving down the side of all the cars waiting to move.

as the bike passed one of the cars, the traffic started to move and the bike scraped the side of a taxi.

The biker started attacking the taxi run running into him..

However this was not the taxis fault. in normal circumstances yu do not always ceck all mirrors when moving off in a traffic jam and you do not exact a bike to be over taking you in that situation.

Since the bike was overtaking and jumping the que, the cause of the collision was him.
Had I had not been waiting for an opertion, I would have battered his fucking bike all over.

The old bastard in the taxi had a fucking bad day, and under no fault of his own.

the same can be said for cyclists... pedestrians and every other road user watch what the fuck you are doing, and don't be a dick.",0,1409236470,null,0,false,0,ck2t5bx,t3_2epe3j,t1_ck2t5bx,t3_2epe3j,null,1427317380,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Academics are only a small part of getting into Oxbridge - coming across as likeable, knowledgeable, engaged and enthusiastic about your subject is hugely important as well. Kids in private schools have advantages in that arena.

It's unsurprising, following that, that those skills carry over into adult life. I used to be on a grad scheme and the selection process for that (tests, competency interviews, one on one interviews, group exercises) were very similar to my Oxford interviews, so obviously I did better than someone who had no experience of that environment.

If a 16-year-old female went nuts for the show in 2006 and churned out pages upon pages of sickly-sweet Ten/Rose fanfic for four years, only to flounce away in a huff when Matt Smith took the role, she was absolutely a *Doctor Who* fan-- she loved the show and went out of her way to produce creative works related to it for her own enjoyment and the enjoyment of others.

The definition of a fan is ""an ardent devotee; an enthusiast."" It has nothing to do with either length of association or willingness to hang around when the object of fannish attraction changes in ways you don't enjoy or approve of.

Gallifrey Base is populated with a small but vocal group of users who watched Classic Who religiously, but were so disgusted with some of the changes in NuWho that they won't touch it with a ten-foot pole.

Person 2 denies that **all** Muslims are rapists. Person 1 interprets this as a claim that **no** Muslims are rapists and believes Person 2 to be denying that rapes have happened.

A) Get out of the group stages  

B) Increase our coefficient so that it is easier to get out of the group stages  

C) Increase our coefficient so that it is easier to win the group stages  


All three of the above rely on us getting as far as we can in the competition. An easy draw is always preferable. Also the last thing we want is the CL affecting our league form.

Beyond this, the fact is the marks are not aligned. The A-levels are better than both GCSE results and University results so something is happening.

England needs to improve to be consistent in midfield before Rooney drops back, when playing with a shit midfield (United) he is held back quite a bit. Sturridge can fit the RvP role for England but just using both of them as strikers in a 4-4-2 would make more sense.

But seriously, not a great deal I'm afraid. You could go to small claims court if you can be bothered, but it probably isn't worth the hassle and expense. You pay £25 just to start the claim (if you do it online), plus court fees and if they refuse to pay, enforcement fees, it would quickly mount up to more than your £150. You would get it all back if you win (and they eventually pay up), but if you loose you have to pay it, plus any reasonable expenses they have had to pay (usually £90 a day for turning up to court, possibly plus for their solicitor, note if you do get a solicitor you won't be able to claim for their fees if you win). Add to that the process can drag on forever and and if the other person can reasonably claim they can't afford to pay it back there is a chance that you either won't get it back, or at £1 a week. 

It may be worth drawing up a letter *threatening the possibility of* court action to try and ""scare"" them into paying up, but it might go nowhere and could just cause a big old fight. 

Depending on how well you know this person, you could either chalk it up to experience and move on, or perhaps offer to let them pay you back a tenner a month or something, you won't get it all back in one go, but at least you'll get some of it back.

If you can't see that the same people from the same schools are in positions of power then you aren't dealing with reality. David Cameron the PM, George Osborne the Chancellor and Boris Johnson the Mayor of London all went to Eton when they were children.

 Take a look at the term fees for that school and wonder to yourself who on earth is able to afford that apart from incredibly wealthy people?
Take a look at where the UK stands on social mobility or where it stands on disparity of wealth between those with the most and those with the least. 
Take a look at what they teach kids at Harrow, they have them ordering around marches, at Eton they ask students how to respond as a prime minister to atrocities carried out by armed forces. 

 I don't begrudge other people's success or hate wealthy people but don't tell me it's a level playing field because it fucking well isn't.

true,lithaborn,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"&gt; Guns are built as tools

The correct use of which is to kill. Unlike cars, whose correct use is transportation

&gt; the negligence of users lies in the fault of the tool itself.

Negligent use of a car can result in death. Correct, competent use of a car probably won't. Negligent use of a gun can result in much more death, and a much higher chance of death from each person hit by a bullet. Correct, competent use of a gun results in....death.

Guns purpose and design is to kill. That's what they were invented to do, that's what they do best. You might shoot them at a target, you might use them to chop down a tree. That's not their intended use. Their intended use is to make stuff die, whether it's humans or other animals.

Go back in time and ask Mr Colt, Ask Mr Smith, ask Mr Wesson, ask any of the people who invented firearms what their inventions were meant to do. Not one of them will say they were meant as a form of safe recreation.

I honestly can't see how anyone can argue against all of this.

&gt; Would you give a 9 year old the keys to a car, much less an uzi? That was negligent of the authority in charge. 

At nine years old, I'd driven a bumper car and not killed anyone. That's what you do as a nine year old. Safe, appropriate activities, properly sanitised so that nobody comes to any harm. Would I have stepped into my father's automobile and driven off? No. What kind of place truly believes that a child should be put in charge of a weapon they know is beyond their capability to control?

Tell you what, let's look at Africa, where children kill people with Kalashnikovs and Uzis all the time. Is it OK for American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to blaze away with a machine gun before they're physically capable of controlling them, just because African children do it all the time and they don't come to any harm?

I'm fairly late to reply, sorry for that. I have no real answer but the fact that people usually tend to stick to what they know.

I was planning to stay from the very beginning. I always loved British culture, sense of humour, the expressive language, etc., so it was a conscious decision to come here. I'm a bit afraid that for many people the decision was purely economic, so they did not know British ways at all before coming here - and they prefer to stick to their own.

As for my English, I was using it actively for over 20 years. It's a de facto standard language of IT.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;It is deflection, plain and simple. You know it, everyone knows it. You do it in the hopes of diluting and confusing any discussion regarding Gaza/Israel.

I didn't mean to confuse you, i'll try not to in the future.

&gt;Lets keep your deflective trend going. Why is it okay for Israel to slowly expand its influence in the West Bank but not for Russia to do this same in Ukraine?

It's not, they are both wrong. So why is it that Russia's program of population replacement has gone unchallenged in Crimea and Ukraine, while Israel's is condemned by the international courts? Why are you personally upset about one and not the other? 

&gt;Seeing as you love your figures, Operation Protective Edge. Gaza = 2000+, Israel = &lt;100 dead.
Does the comparatively low number of deaths in the Gaza conflict not show that Hamas is actually showing more restraint in their conflict than any other nation would in their position?

It shows that Israel has spend billions on building bomb shelters and anti-missile technology to protect it citizens. While Hamas has used all of the building materials it has to construct tunnels into Israel and for smuggling weapons into Gaza. 

&gt;Israel has admitted to using the Dahiya doctrine in the past, and said it wouldn't hesitate to do so in the future. It's not targeted, it's completely indiscriminate.

Completely indiscriminate? Ok so lets examine that. Does Israel not provide warnings of imminent attacks? Doest it not drop fliers beforehand? Does it not fire warnings? As i said before, Isreal shows [restraint,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTArVIHDelg) your friends in Hamas do not. 

&gt;You want to take out Hamas, do so with precise targeted missiles. Not by levelling whole cities/towns.

That's exactly what they do, the problem is Hamas, the cowards that they are, base themselves in schools and hospitals and heavily populated areas, because they want as many civilian casualties as they can get. 

&gt;Where is your evidence that they did not target civilians?

The burden of proof is yours. You are the one making the claim.

Students from paid-for education are more likely to get into those universities, not just due to the higher quality of that education, but also because of the attitudes/expectations imparted by their upbringing.

&gt; David Cameron the PM, George Osborne the Chancellor and Boris Johnson the Mayor of London all went to Eton when they were children.

And of the last 5 Prime Ministers, only two (David Cameron and Tony Blair) received paid-for education. One of them (John Major) left school at 16 with only 3 O-Levels. In fact, David Cameron is the first privately educated Conservative Prime Minister since Alec Douglas-Home lost the 1964 general election.

&gt; at Eton they ask students how to respond as a prime minister

Odd that you'd mention that. I distinctly remember being given writing assignments in school history/english classes along the lines of ""imagine you were king/prime minister during x event, how would you respond to y criticism"".

&gt; don't tell me it's a level playing field

It certainly isn't. It will never be unless you enforce strict communism and require all children to be raised by state-approved foster parents.

Hmm, that's not what they implied (which, hilariously, they kept claiming was in our own interests - bullshit).

I was just auto-enrolled (was making my own arrangements before then), and it includes a form showing how much commission will be taken for ""advice"" over the term of the pension.

&gt; For arranging your plan, we'll pay commission to AON CONSULTING LIMITED.

For the first year alone their projection is £53 in **advice commission alone**! This goes to £90+ p/a later on based upon conservative projections.

I use the word advice extremely loosely: it's just a glide-path algorithm with their own index funds, which seem to be more expensive than those on the open market (i.e. special Aviva editions of BlackRock trackers you'd see on the open market, but with a higher TER for no apparent reason - backdoor commission?).

This is *entirely aside* from the 1% p/a pot fee.

Indeed, my rough calculations indicate that when you add together all of the fees for advice, yearly fees, trail commission/special higher-cost funds that the TER is probably about 2%. This compares extremely badly to my SIPP which is ~£90 p/a, and minimal trading costs, perhaps £150 p/a all in.

The funny thing is that I can buy the exact same Aviva pension on the open market at 0.45%.

Anyway, I have a plan afoot. It's free to move money from the pension to another provider: so I'm just going to keep doing that on a regular basis and use that so I can get matched contributions :-). Bastards!

The problem lies in the plain fact that even responsible use of a gun means that something stands a high risk of dying, as is the same for the responsible use of any weapon.

The question one must ask is when does it become overkill? You can use the self-protection argument, but when you have people who collect rifles and handguns and machine guns, when you have people who proudly exhibit their 40+ firearms....that is no longer a case of self protection. Nobody, not even someone living in Iraq or Afghanistan needs *that* much personal protection.

So what else is it? Is it the fact that they're allowed, therefore they *must* overindulge? Is it that they are in *that much* fear? If that's the case, they need therapy, not a weapons license. Isn't it just a case of overconsumption yet again?

I've seen the argument, too, that the criminals and gang kids who are going around using guns on other people would get hold of guns regardless of their easy availability. When i pointed out that I was from a country whose experience made a lie of that argument, i was called ignorant and naive. Criminals do not have easy legal access to firearms in this country and *haven't* found a way of getting hold of them anyway, and many countries in the same situation can say the same thing.

Banning guns would be unhelpful. making them harder to attain, and making the manufacturers and distributors more responsible for who they distribute them to would go a long way to at least slowing the problems down.",0,1409240226,null,0,false,0,ck2uzzf,t3_2erse5,t1_ck2uzzf,t1_ck2ul2l,null,1427315910,2,false,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,2

&gt; Hmm, that's not what they implied (which, hilariously, they kept claiming was in our own interests - bullshit).
&gt; 
&gt; I was just auto-enrolled (was making my own arrangements before then), and it includes a form showing how much commission will be taken for ""advice"" over the term of the pension.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;For arranging your plan, we'll pay commission to AON CONSULTING LIMITED.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;For the first year alone their projection is £53 in advice commission alone!

To be fair, nobody should expect an adviser to work for free. We bill companies directly and our fees are about double that per member per annum, and we price fairly competitively. That said, it's very service dependent. We tend to do annual surgeries and the like.

&gt; I use the word advice extremely loosely: it's just a glide-path algorithm with their own index funds, which seem to be more expensive than those on the open market (i.e. special Aviva editions of BlackRock trackers you'd see on the open market, but with a higher TER for no apparent reason - backdoor commission?).

&gt; This is entirely aside from the 1% p/a pot fee.

That would be pretty unusual. Insured pension arrangements tend to merge any administration cost, commission (if applicable) and fund costs, into one fee. This is why they tend to look more expensive on the face of it.

Backdoor commission is illegal. The legal stance of insured funds is that the assets belong to the insurance company, and so they name the cost. As just mentioned, they tend to combine most costs into the fund charges.
 
&gt; My rough calculations indicate that when you add together all of the fees for advice, yearly fees, trail commission/special higher-cost funds that the TER is probably about 2%. This compares extremely badly to my SIPP which is ~£90 p/a, and minimal trading costs, perhaps £120 p/a.
&gt; 
&gt; The funny thing is that I can buy the exact same Aviva pension on the open market at 0.45%.

You're probably ""buying"" the pension through your employer at 0.45% + payment of commission + terms.

The products aren't comparable, and insurance companies dislike auto enrolment schemes. Think about it, they have to do the same administration job whether £1 per month or £200 per month is being paid. They can be selective with personal pensions because they can limit the minimum investment, but AE deals have to be open to all. Whilst that's annoying as an individual, it's just a fact of life.

For anything less than about £20,000, the cheapest a pension gets is ~0.5%, be this a ""master trust"" arrangement like NEST or People's Pension, or a low-cost broker + tracker funds. The master trust schemes keep their costs low through scale, and the the brokers can limit minimums.

&gt; Anyway, I have a plan afoot. It's free to move money from the pension to another provider: so I'm just going to keep doing that on a regular basis :-). Bastards!

I wouldn't worry. As of April 2015 the charges will reduce to 0.75% (or Aviva will refuse to continue running the scheme and it will be replaced with a similar pension costing at or less than 0.75%) and all commission payments to the adviser will stop.

Also, I know the general consensus is that we need a direct AML (Chadli), a AMC (Eriksen) and someone cutting inside at AMR like Lamela - but looking at our average positions vs QPR, especially Chadli - they're literally right on top of eachother and VERY narrow. 

Eriksen can actually cross the ball, and while he's not in that traditional direct inside forward mold he's pretty pacey and with Davies less inclined to get forward behind him it will give him room to roam if needs be. What I'm getting at is - Eriksen - Holtby - Lamela. The creativity from those front 3 would be something special with a rock solid Capoue/Bentaleb/(Scheniderlin)(if he comes) pairing behind them. 

I would even say to sweeten the deal (Schenderlin seems very important to Poch's system), let Townsend go as Southampton are interested, and have Chadli (who has started great), Eriksen on the left and a youth prospect like Oduwa stepping up. 

Slightly off topic - but if that isn't a consideration (for Poch), then I would still like the first part of the deal (Townsend &gt; Schneiderlin) and then us to bring in a real talented young AML as the final piece of the puzzle and keep Eriksen central. If we can also shift a couple more who don't fit the system, our net spend is so low that we are (if needs be) in a position to test the waters with a few great AML's out there.

true,AidanSmeaton,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"I beg your pardon. ""Throw my toys out the pram""? I think this is a misunderstanding of what the independence proposition is, and it's a pretty snarky remark to make.

You should understand that Scotland is a *country*, not a region. Scotland should be compared to Wales or England, not Northumbria - I think this is where your misunderstanding comes from. If you still don't see the difference, you still don't get the problem.

&gt; Why can't the UK as a whole do better with your help? Is it some form of selfishness?

You need to not take this personally. There is *nothing* selfish about wishing to manage your own affairs. You need to understand that Scotland has been shafted by Westminster over decades, and we have good reason to want to see an end to this. We've also seen how our own devolved parliament, Holyrood, has been more competently running our country with the limited powers it has. If the UK worked for Scotland, we would want to stay. It's as simple as that.

The politics in Scotland are very different to England. We sit centre-left, England sits centre-right. For example, UKIP came 1st in England and in the UK overall in the EU Elections, whereas they came 4th in Scotland. There is only 1 Tory MP in Scotland and yet we have a Tory coalition government. These differences would probably be okay if Scotland was the same size as England, but it's not, and this means we *always* have to compromise as part of the union. You might say ""compromise is normal"", but I'm sure you wouldn't say that if the UK suddenly became part of a country of 600 million people (10 times its size), the majority of which were completely out of touch with UK issues, leaving the UK's voice consistently outnumbered and overruled. This is an analogy, but it's the reality for the people of Scotland. Our votes in Westminster do not matter and we consistently get a raw deal as every Westminster party is out of touch with Scottish issues.

Believe it or not, most of us would like the UK to work for us. If Scotland was served well by Westminster, there's no doubt we would be happy to stay. The idea of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland resonates with people here. Sadly, the reality doesn't match up to ideology. We have been mismanaged as a country, treated as second class citizens, and are no longer satisfied with the establishment. This isn't personal, it's political. We have nothing against the people of the rest of the UK.

&gt; Screw the rest - 'got mine'.

No, not at all. If the UK is working so well for the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland - it will continue to work well for them. Do you think Ireland, Canada, New Zealand etc were all selfish to choose to govern their own affairs? Certainly not. It's sensible and appropriate to end a political union when it no longer works for a nation in that union.

Maybe you're not aware, but Scotland already functions as a country anyway. We have a completely separate NHS, education system, criminal justice system, police force, and even our own parliament to manage devolved affairs. The parliament has proportional representation (we even have 2 Green MSPs!) and the devolved powers have been crucial in protecting Scottish people from bizarre Westminster policies such as offsetting the bedroom tax and student tuition fees. We are given a block grant from Westminster (which, as a percentage of expenditure, is less than the percentage of tax we raise), and choose to prioritise social initiatives.

Many of us believe that Holyrood can and should get full power over affairs that are currently reserved for Westminster. Tax, defence, immigration, energy, benefits, foreign policy, broadcasting, trade and industry, data protection, consumer rights, the Constitution. We've shown how, when given the opportunity, we run things differently. There are no plans for a federalised or a fully devolved (devo-max) UK, so independence is our only option.

You can pass through without attending these without missing on too much, but it's a shame. As other commenters have said, you're going to need a lounge suit anyway (for job interviews, etc).

As to black tie, there are a couple of occasions where you might want it, and one mandatory occasion, graduation, where you'll need *part* of the stuff involved in black tie. You can just hire it.

Illegal firearms are, however, few and far between, meaning that the supply is limited, or the desire or need to be illegally tooled up in the UK is substantially less than in the states. Why? because you can be pretty confident that you're not going to be faced with a firearm in the commission of your crime. So you have the situation where the good people have guns to defend themselves from the bad people who have guns because the good people have guns.

And it never occurs to people that if the good people didn't have as many guns, the bad people wouldn't need as many guns.

And you people tend to be in ""gangs"" or groups with their immediate peers. In catholicism, thats white catholics. In Muslim communities, it's asian muslims.

Abuse happens in all sectors of society. One of the bigger issues here is that the authorities didn't just ignore it for fear of being branded racist (in the same way as the authorities didn't investigate priests because they're respected). It's that the victims were seen as consenting. Because our culture says women who have sex are bad. To the extent that girls of eleven were seen as consenting, purely because they behaved a certain way. Because authorities can't see that ""bad"" behaviour from a child isn't because the kid is bad, it's because they're in a shit situation.

This is about poor children being seen as deserving and consenting to whatever they get. Because our society is fucked.

true,Lirael,cnty-expat,Expat in USA,"You're unlikely to convince anyone from a country that has low gun crime/firearm related deaths that your country's way of doing it is better (assuming you are American here, sorry if I'm incorrect). Call it ignorance if you want, and sorry if that makes you sad, but that's just how it is. You might think you are educating us, but mostly people here will just shake their heads at you. We're similar countries in a lot of ways, but when it comes to gun culture we are entire worlds apart. Building straw men about how we think guns are ""evil"" and so forth is ineffective, we're merely pointing out its purpose - it's people we are concerned with, and  I suspect most of us wouldn't even trust most people we DO know with a gun, so why would we think that people we *don't* know should have them? The fact is, most people aren't very responsible - you can argue until you're blue in the face about responsible gun ownership, but until you can convince us that most people actually would be responsible with a projectile weapon designed for killing things, you might as well be banging your head against a wall. If you're willing to keep banging your head against that particular wall, I wouldn't go throwing around words like ""fucking idiots"" at other people.

I'm British, but I live in the US, I like it here, and I'm not looking to change it. However, in the time I have lived here, a teenage boy shot and killed a bunch of people two blocks from where I worked because he was pissed off that his girlfriend broke up with him, and the local mall got shot up by some asshole a couple christmases back. There have been a bunch of other shootings, although those were often gang related and/or aimed at specific people. My workplace also received a call that an armed gunman was on his way to us - didn't materialize in the end, but it was still a pretty strange experience. I live in Oregon, which is actually pretty low on the list of states as far as gun related homicides go.

Not really something that was ever on my radar in the UK, not to say there haven't been incidents - but they are very few and very far between. I'm guessing that this is just a fact of life to you if you grew up here.

Libertarian as a word in British English pre-dates its use to describe a set of Anarcho-Socialist ideas. In English it originates first in metaphysics, but has been used to refer to advocates of liberty from the end of the 18th century, all be it not commonly. This may be because although it was never popularised in this sense, it is pretty much its literal meaning.

It wasn't until 1857, that Joseph Déjacque used an equivalent French word to refer to his anarcho-socialist ideas, which is how the word was popularised outside of the US. 100 years later, and American anarcho-capitalists adopted the word, popularising this meaning in the US.

I think it's sensible for Libertarian to be used to refer to people who oppose authority and promote individual choice, to the extent they want no government or radically limited government.

true,michal77,eng-kent,Kent,"I'm sorry I kept you waiting for so long, but I've been pretty busy during last two days and was coming home quite tired. This is what I have to say on that matter:

First of all, I am fine with the fact that everyone is different and I'm first to give credit where credit is due. You worked hard: good for you. You'll be the part of elite. I'm not denying that those who want, can achieve a success and get out of the system well educated. You might be one of them, just if I can give you my 2p of advice: work on your grammar a little bit more because if an immigrant corrects you, then something is not right. No offence meant.

Secondly, I'd like to apologize for making such sweeping generalization. My post wasn't meant to be a thorough analysis though, just a bunch of observations. The one about education is important, in my opinion, as it touches on something I believe is a systematic problem here in UK. And I have a feeling the one about services quality is a direct result.

Thirdly, you are mistaken about the school where my stepson is attending. It's in the heart of Kent in one of the most affluent areas in the country, almost 100% white British middle class, and is considered one of the best schools around. The stats from this year A Level examination: 100% A*-E pass rate and 48% A*-B grades with all students offered the university of their choice.

Fourthly, what I'm going to write is about what I know: secondary school here. I didn't have any personal experience with sixth form education or universities yet, as my stepson is just starting his A Levels. Just remember that the bunch of the students will leave secondary school, move into vocational education, and then will become a large part of the work force here in UK - most probably they will became the bulk of the service industry employees. So, again, this is where the problem with services comes from, in my opinion. Below if I'm comparing with Poland, it is with a similar level of education which is called *gimnazjum*.

OK, enough disclaimers. I strongly believe that where the problem with British education lies is its inability to form good habits outside of the curriculum. Pay attention here, because I'm trying to write not about the amount and quality of knowledge, but about the cultural differences and the different outcomes of two different education styles.

In Poland, a school year is split into two semesters. In every subject, in every semester, you can expect to have: several small and large internal **graded** tests (some of which unannounced), a homework after almost every lesson (often verified and graded) and some random oral Q&amp;A sessions that are almost always graded. At the end of semester it's not uncommon to have 10-20 grades in every subject. During the week, it's usual to have 2-3 and sometimes as far as five homework items every day. Students are expected to be on top of everything all the time, and to put in some work at home every day. At the end of a year you'll get a grade that's a result of all the grades along the way - so it's indicative of the ongoing work you did throughout the whole year, not only based on some vague assessment of the teacher or a ""big test at the end"".

So, at the end of the year you can get a ""5"" which means ""very good"", a ""6"" which is rare and means ""exceptional"", a ""1"" which means ""insufficient"" and is a non-passing grade, or anything in between. You can fix your ""1"" grade by taking an exam in front of a board, but if you have three such low notes there's no going out of it - you have to repeat the whole year. Sometimes several times, until you pass in all subjects.

I'm not saying this is in every aspect better. You can argue about the time potentially wasted because of stuff that will be irrelevant in a kid's future life and I won't disagree with you. But what you get out of that, is a culture that values ongoing work, ongoing improvement, which doesn't tell you that ""no matter what you do, it's only important to pass the test at the end"". Kids in Poland learn to work every day, not slack. They learn that if they ignore a month or two, they might lose a year. They learn how it is to be kept accountable for their efforts, how it is to be punished for the lack of the effort, and how even a slight amount of work can be rewarded. So - even in secondary school they learn how the adult life will treat them. This changes quite a lot.

In UK, on the other hand, I noticed a prevalent test culture. GCSEs are just an example. You do not have to work at school - if you don't care, you'll get through the education system anyway, you'll be able to go to the college, then remain on welfare or get some lowly job, maybe complete education someday and climb up on the social ladder - or maybe not. Kids here, generally, do not have the incentive to work all the time, to improve themselves, to strive for excellence. I know that it's partially the parent's job to instill these values in the young - but the school is not helping, and in effect you very often get adults who still do not have the concept of, simply put, doing the good job - and the associated pleasure of accomplishment.

Admit it, you can go through secondary school and a vocational college without putting much effort, can't you? It is possible to have kids in year 11 who have problems with reading and writing, isn't it? In Poland that's just impossible. If you pass your mandatory education age limit without completing secondary school, and then quit, you'll be a social pariah, with no chance for a job and any kind of social standing - unless you can distinguish yourself with something else. But that's an exception to a rule.

In the end - if you combine the large crowd on poorly educated people completing British secondary education, with no other option than vocational college that as far as I know doesn't instill the work ethos either, you are getting: hairdressers that do not know how to do a quality haircut, office clerks who misplace customers' documentation, painters who leave dirty floor and smudges of paint on the windows, slackers, and plain idiots. If you combine that with the typical British courtesy, stiff upper lip, people's constraint from complaining, you'll get incompetents that do not have a slightest idea that they are incompetent, that they can (and should!) improve, that they have anything to improve at all! This is a sad state of things, a kind of a country-wide [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), and a reason why I (and many others in this thread) see the British service industry as so utterly fucked.

If you have other views on the matter, I'll be happy to read them - but please be polite going on. Thanks!",0,1409242987,null,0,false,0,ck2whal,t3_2ej1zf,t1_ck2whal,t1_ck10ks3,null,1427314653,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,lommym,num11,,"To nitpick (especially as someone coming from a lot of FIFA), I'll list my changes below.. but I think you got a lot right.

Soldado - 83 *I don't think they'll drop his important stats that much to make him lose 2 OVR points.

Eriksen - 84 *Probably depends on whether or not they list him as CAM or LM, but I can't see them lifting him 3 points.

Paulinho - 80 *I honestly don't think they'll change him at all... especially if he's still a CM

Bentaleb - 74 *Great kid, and I think it got enough attention to lift him up to that point.. plus, that'd put him on the edge for a gold in-form for UT if he got 2 plus one hell of an OP silver card.

Rose - 73 *No change, I don't think

Kaboul - 78 *75 would be a 5 point drop, which would be rough for a player they would be guessing on... a wee drop though, might happen.

Dier - 74 *One of FIFA's wonderkids (can get a pretty nice overall) so I can't see them keeping him at 73.  At least 74, if not higher (barely).

Naughton - 73 *Same as Danny, can't see them downgrading him a point.

Walker - 79 *I don't think they will change him either

Davies *I'm not sure, I think you're probably right.. small upgrade, but he did have a solid year... we'll see. 

Fazio - 79 *One point upgrade over last year, as his defense-specific stats will probably get a nice little boost.

Lloris - 85 *While I think he is one of the best, his distribution attributes may hurt his OVR

This was really nitpicky, and completely pointless... easily one of the silliest things I've ever written.  You did a great job, though... I agree on a whole lot of your guesses.  Oh I didn't see Adebayor on your list, just now.. Started as an 80 last year.. but I could see him getting the drop for no reason (EA has done this a lot in the past)... 79/80 is the safe bet.

Because it's right there in the report ffs! The ex MP for the area, the former heads of child protective services and many people who have been deeply involved have all said that the PC climate of not wanting to seem racist was a factor in the lack of investigatin into these crimes. If you think you know better than all of them, you better have some damn good evidence. 

You now for some reason are completely 100% focusing on the police, the main problems with political correctness were with the social workers, child services and councillors. 

&gt;Why are people not concerned that these working class children were ignored by the police again! The pattern that is emerging from these child abuse cases is that the police don't give a fuck about these poor kids. It's happened in this case and in the Saville case. Why does no one give a fuck about this pattern? Why is that pattern not discussed in this thread?

I have heard this discussed extensively on the news coverage, the police culture of disbelieving victims is disgusting and needs to be sorted out urgently. 

As for why people are blaming ""lefties"", it's maybe because multiculturalism and PC are seen as left wing policies. The ex labour MP in the area pretty much spells it out: ""Perhaps yes, as a true Guardian reader, and liberal leftie, I suppose I didn’t want to raise that too hard. “I think there was a culture of not wanting to rock the multicultural community boat if I may put it like that."" 

When you also bear in mind the same woman in charge of child services while this was going on took kids away from foster parents because they supported UKIP, can you really be surprised people point out the political motivations of the people involved?

3 - yes, these studies take that into account but hardly can be blamed on immigration.  Housing shortage is a problem in which any Government with increasing population should address and we are doing a particularly bad job in the UK.  (side-note this seems contrary to your 2nd point).

Not sure why I'm getting the accusation of being lefty, the free flow of labour is not a left notion, but a right notion.  Companies have access to larger and cheaper workforces.  

Also, a very large point people forget in this argument as well is that we need immigrants to pay for our growing population as we in Western Europe are not increasing at the rate of our parents.

I love it when conspiracy theorists tell people to ""do some research"" because they almost always mean read some random blogs and watch youtube videos which for some reason are apparently far more valid sources of information than actual research. For instance in this case I 'did some research' on Tony Gosling and drew my own conclusions based on the information he puts about himself in the public domain. Somehow that wasn't valid research though?

Your only point is the immigrants make us money. Considering we haven't actually spent any money increasing services I'd contend that those savings would soon be lost if we actually spent money to meet the additional demand.

My point being that while private school probably helped me into Cambridge, it hasn't done squat for me without the golden pairing of an Oxbridge degree. I think the solution here lies in addressing school education inequalities, but there is also an inherent problem in how degrees are available from anywhere, and yet never compared by an governing body in terms of quality or consistency.

I would humbly suggest therefore that instead of a meritocracy, we design an system where the naturally occurring elite will feel their selfish impulse is catered for in a way that benefits not only themselves or their immediate social grouping, but also society at large. 


Designing this ""win-win"" system would be intensely difficult however, because quite often it would be open to abuse by psychopaths, who frequent the upper echelons of all societies in history with alarming frequency, and do not have normal human risk-reward inclinations.

How are we all supposed to live if we can never build a railway line or a power station for NIMBYs protecting their property prices? These people probably drive down the M40 themselves, and they want to stop other people getting home?

There is so much bullshit in UKIP's narrative - they're just selling selfishness. ",0,1409243905,null,0,false,0,ck2x046,t3_2et6f3,t1_ck2x046,t1_ck2sxek,null,1427314329,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Maybe you should revisit a simple economics lesson. There are more supporters of the club now, thus more demand to go to the games.

Even current season ticket holders are going to find themselves increasingly outpriced. Obviously not by foreign fans, but by new fans who who have more disposable income. I'd guess that the core matchday support at City is still made up of fairly working class people. It's not right that a fan who might have been attending games and loyally supporting his team for decades has to give up his/her season ticket, just because he or she can no longer justify the cost. Surely you see that?

Not all of them have season tickets; some may have done in the past, and have relinquished them for whatever reason, but still want to go to games. Others may never have had them, but might have been going to games for years and years, as and when they find the time or money. These people will more than likely be attending more matches a season than your average trippers, tourists, foreign fans etc. The costs are going to add up, and they may find themselves out-priced by newer, more affluent fans, tourists, or foreign visitors who are spending megabucks on their trip anyway.

I know that the world isn't sunshine and rainbows and I realise that this the way things are in football these days, but surely you can understand how older fans are upset? Oh, and I think I've got the gist of how supply and demand works though now, so thanks a bunch for that patronising little lesson...

Anyway, the money brought in from sticking £15-20 on a match ticket really isn't going to make a tangible difference to the club's coffers, but it does make a difference to fans. 

You may think that its just economics and that the only people who deserve tickets for City are those who can afford them, but its not that simple for a lot of fans.

As a Unionist I can see with crystal clarity that a great deal of SNP support comes from them putting Scottish politics first and not worrying about the big picture in the whole of the UK.

... I also think they lose support, particularly from me, because while they don't pander to Westminster they pander to independence and instead of having the shadow of the Labour party HQ spin doctors and focus groups they have the union to break up.

I think it would be far better if Scottsh Labour, Tories, LibDems all took the whip from their parties in England but were independent parties.

I'm also well aware that for career politicians Westminster is the place to be not Holyrood and that may be why we have second best politicians - at least for the 'no' side of things.

I can forsee the SNP losing the independence vote 40/60 and still getting an overall majority - possibly even a bigger one.

Woop. Bait taken! Firstly, thanks for taking the time to reply, despite this thread largely coming out of view and my obvious attempt at riling you up, so I will at least return the favour. Upvote for you. That said...

&gt;You should understand that Scotland is a country, not a region. Scotland should be compared to Wales or England, not Northumbria

Really. It should? Why? Northumbria was a Kingdom once after all much like Scotland is now, and it incorporated a lot of your southern clay at its greatest extent. Not that I do consider Scotland a region... but why should I consider it a fully fledged country other than the fact that the UK is a country of countries? I don't consider England or Wales as countries. Are you aware that pretty much the only thing that defines a country is other countries recognition as such. How many other countries recognise Scotland as a country? You might have better luck with Nation.

&gt;There is nothing selfish about wishing to manage your own affairs.

Perhaps not. There is about abandoning the rest of your country to do so, however. Rather than merely attempting to change the system from within the inside.

&gt;You need to understand that Scotland has been shafted by Westminster over decades.

So has Cumbria, probably a lot worse than yourselves. Yet I don't see them forming their own parties and trying to secede.

&gt;We've also seen how our own devolved parliament, Holyrood, has been more competently running our country with the limited powers it has.

Great. Devolution works. Should have more of it, no? All the benefits without the crazy bits.

&gt;The politics in Scotland are very different to England. We sit centre-left, England sits centre-right.

Really? http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/files/scotcen-ssa-report.pdf - sounds to me like you're looking through a confirmation bias.

&gt;For example, UKIP came 1st in England and in the UK overall in the EU Elections, whereas they came 4th in Scotland. 

As an example, that is poor. Your MEPs are for Scotland only. It matters not at all what happened in England, in that respect. There are many other factors at play in that result other than just mere political spectrum.

&gt;There is only 1 Tory MP in Scotland and yet we have a Tory coalition government. 

There is only 2 LibDem and 2 Conservative MPs in the North East with 25 Labour, yet we have a LibCon coalition government. This is how FPTP democracy works. Scotland hasn't always voted contrary to the national result, thus it would be foolish merely to use living memory as your timeframe. 

&gt;we always have to compromise as part of the union. You might say ""compromise is normal"", but I'm sure you wouldn't say that if the UK suddenly became part of a country of 600 million people (10 times its size), the majority of which were completely out of touch with UK issues

Well. The UK is part of an 'ever closer union' of 450million. And I would say in that institution, compromise is normal. We're not even a member of any of the decent sized parties. Yet, no one takes independence from it too seriously beyond a few overenthusiastic crazies from the DM and Express. This despite it, actually being out of touch and often acting against the interests of the UK itself. But if the UK actually enthusiastically cooperated within the union, it would work a lot better for us.

&gt;Our votes in Westminster do not matter and we consistently get a raw deal as every Westminster party is out of touch with Scottish issues.

Oh please. It isn't like Scottish MPs vote in unison on issues of concern. 'Constantly' is just pure hyperbole. The needs of Scotland are considered relevant to their size and importance. Much like they are in Wales, NI, or the West Country.

&gt;We have been mismanaged as a country, treated as second class citizens, and are no longer satisfied with the establishment.

How have you been mismanaged? Have the resources of the Union not been spread between its constituents as required? Does Scotland not receive a higher spend per head than the rest of the UK due to its geographical challenges? Etc. How are you treated as second class citizens? I can understand being dissatisfied, but there are ways and means of addressing that which doesn't necessitate drawing arbitrary borders between what are, effectively, the same people.

&gt;. The idea of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland resonates with people here. 

Well it should be. They wanted Home Rule and they should have got it. They are the same people too. They left our union only to rejoin us later in a similar one with more members. At least Ireland had actual and significant grievances with the rest of Britain, though. I believe had they stayed and resolved the issues, Ireland would be a lot better state right now with far fewer expatriates.

&gt; Do you think Ireland, Canada, New Zealand etc were all selfish to choose to govern their own affairs? Certainly not. It's sensible and appropriate to end a political union when it no longer works for a nation in that union.

Products of a different time with different constraints, each with their own individual circumstances. There was also the realisation that a small island very far away ruling over continental landmasses was a little silly. A federal imperial union would have suited us all much better no doubt had the political will been there with the technology to support it, especially with the continuation of the sterling zone. I'd happily still be in a Union with the realms, especially if freedom of movement was still possible. It is worth considering, that Australia for example delayed the ratification of the Statute of Westminster considerably and had heavy ties back home until the UK went full EEC, which really pissed them off (rightfully). Also, was the USA wrong to go to war with its own states over unification, the confederacy certainly didn't think it was right for them after all?

&gt;Maybe you're not aware, but Scotland already functions as a country anyway. We have a completely separate NHS, education system, criminal justice system, police force, and even our own parliament to manage devolved affairs.

Sounds like devolved powers. Less devolved powers than a German lander. You probably should have more. We all should.

&gt;Many of us believe that Holyrood can and should get full power over affairs that are currently reserved for Westminster. Tax, defence, immigration, energy, benefits, foreign policy, broadcasting, trade and industry, data protection, consumer rights, the Constitution.

I agree mostly. Except for powers which ought to be reserved for a Union Government, like defence, foreign policy, energy, immigration. Regardless, Scotland wishes for EU and NATO membership, which defers a great deal of these powers elsewhere regardless.

&gt;There are no plans for a federalised or a fully devolved (devo-max) UK, so independence is our only option.

Because no one is trying to get it. It is not like the SNP attempted to convince the British government or the wider population of federation first. No, it just went full secession. We'll end up being governed more effectively by the EU within our EU regions at this rate. If the SNP used half as much energy and funding to push for federation, with the support of other union MP's, we'd be a damn sight closer to getting it, as when people come together, they work a lot more effectively. 

&gt;We can work better together by being politically separate.

We can work better together by actually working together.

true,dustofnations,null,null,"I'm going to chase them up and see. Their wording is extremely wooly, and there is no total expense estimation in the literature I've just received.

Either way you look at it, if we're claiming to be doing what's in the best interests of the employee, the employer should be obliged to make the same contributions to an external pension as they do to their own. In the case of my company, they're willing only to match contributions if you use their pension - they're perfectly willing to contribute to an external one but without the matched element. From what I gather, this is because of the deal negotiated with the pension co/advisors.

&gt; To be fair, nobody should expect an adviser to work for free. We bill companies directly and our fees are about double that per member per annum, and we price fairly competitively. That said, it's very service dependent. We tend to do annual surgeries and the like.

Advice for a fixed fee I can handle. It makes absolutely no sense that it requires a percentage fee. They don't provide any real advice, it's just a standard algorithm and they don't advise anyone to deviate from it (or provide advice for alternatives). Take the standard path, or nothing. 

The quoted estimation is based upon me making a measly 2% pension contribution. The level it's at now is 3x higher than that. So ~£160 p/a (and they don't offer anything to justify it) - as it's percentage based, that's just *first year* - it'll get worse later.

Anyway, this is going a tad off topic - safe to say I've calculated that for me it's significantly cheaper to use a SIPP + cheap Vanguard funds. Certainly comes out with an expense ratio that's a darn sight better than the 1%+ for the existing situation.

BTW pension administration work is entirely automated in almost all cases, so irrespective of contribution amounts the cost to handle a customer is fairly low and fixed (the sort of software I write is what they use to do that!). Percentage fees are destructive both to the long-term value of the portfolio and represent extremely bad value for all but the tiniest pension pots. Obviously I'm preaching to the choir on that.

true,agentdcf,flair8,,"If this is the case, then Pochetino must be fairly confident of his health. From the first few games, it seems that incredibly important roles are occupied by the players playing in front of and dropping between the centrebacks, through the middle of the pitch. Our attacking group got the credit last weekend, but we need to recognize the brilliant performance of our middle and backend, who were just as vital to that victory. Capoue has been absolutely amazing in that role so far, and I think it was underappreciated how much he did against QPR. He was not only brilliant at stepping in front of balls aimed at QPR's frontmen, but he and Bentaleb were deep-lying pivots that recycled possessions, shifting the ball quickly from side to side. That made our probing attacks really effective in total, and you can see it really clearly on the 48-pass event. 

But, we really only have Capoue and Bentaleb for those roles. I'm totally unconvinced that Paulinho is suited for one of them. Holtby might be able to fill Bentaleb's spot against weaker teams, but that's iffy. Dembele I think is a poor fit for it, though he probably deserves a chance to adapt. 

With the heavy schedule and the fundamental importance of these roles for Pochetino's system, we need depth here. This explains the pursuit of Schneiderlin (though obviously he's a very good player in his own right), which while I deeply hope continues and is successful, seems unlikely at this point. That means we need a healthy Sandro. The fact that our pursuit of Schneiderlin seems to have tapered off and we haven't heard about us going after similar players means that Pochetino must be reasonably satisfied that Sandro's fitness will allow him to play in that role moving forward. 

EDIT: I guess we'll see today, because we've got Sandro and Dembele filling those roles. Should be an interesting test.

But saying all people who identify as christian have a bad attitude to women and gay people and child abuse is. Because it's wrong, making unfair generalisations, and encouraging religious hatred.

The reason islamophobia is in the news right now is because of the prevalence of right wing *actually* fascist groups claiming all muslims think the same thing and are evil.

That's why I think it's important not to slide into islamophobia.

I'm also an atheist. I hate all religion. I don't hate all religious people. I think freedom of religion is important. We should focus on getting rid of the structures of oppression that mean people are pushed into or misled into being religious in the first place. Not stigmatise anyone who was brought up in a faith.

Best case scenario, someone will think it hints that there are some great things about Doctor Who, but, like you said, the episode is ""mostly garbage"" and won't inspire much faith that the rest of the series is any better.

I'm actually torn on whether Blink is a good intro. It's a great episode, but it's very atypical in that The Doctor is barely there. Same goes for Love and Monsters.

Personally, I'd go with another episode that introduces the character of The Doctor, but hints at the grand scope of its history. The Eleventh Hour does it well, and I'd seriously consider Day of the Doctor. No doubt it would hold a bigger impact for someone who's already a fan, but it's an amazing episode, and even though it involves a major step in the state of Gallifrey, the scene where all the Doctors heroically converge *and* hint at the show's future with Capaldi is awe-inspiring.",0,1409247962,null,0,false,0,ck2z8xs,t3_2etq56,t1_ck2z8xs,t3_2etq56,null,1427312714,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

For reggae I'd say Cosies is your best bet http://www.cosies.co.uk/cosies-by-night.htm got a really good night called Rufnek Discotek. Really relaxed venue with little smoking caves everyone sits and gets lean in.

The canteen is good for live music but a little bit more expensive pretty big with good food too. http://www.canteenbristol.co.uk

Leftbank is my personal favourite seen some good live music there and really good vibes. http://www.leftbankbar.co.uk

For a chilled pint The Prince of Wales is great. 

The best places are generally in Stokes Croft on Gloucester Road

For Jungle try Motion/Lakota/Blue Mountain

Mr Wolfs is great for late nights when nowhere else is still open

1) I don't think you can make a leather balloon that floats, particularly one that will also lift a giant steal box.
2) the ""Pod"" has no shown means of control, the plan seems to be, float around till all the air leaves the balloon and hop to not land on water.

true,Lukasa,null,null,"Hi there! I did an MPhys at St Andrews, graduated in 2012, so I suspect I can be of some help.

The short answer is that the School of Physics at St Andrews is excellent. They've got a huge focus on teaching, unlike a lot of top universities which view undergraduates as a distraction. The early curriculum is broad, and you'll get a good grounding in a lot of disciplines. There's also a decent bit of crossover with the School of Maths, and if you're interested in theory you'll get a really good education there. 

If you're an experimentalist at heart, however, the last year of your degree might be a bit limiting. The School's research focus is photonics, and so if you like light and lasers you'll do great. Otherwise, you might find that you'd rather study something else. Hard to know until you get there though.

Finally, you've got a great chance to get a good degree. The faculty care a great deal about you doing as well as possible and the number of students who graduate with first class honours is very high. If you want to succeed, the School will help you. 

Let me know if you have more specific questions, I'm happy to help.",0,1409249443,null,0,false,0,ck301l1,t3_2etva7,t1_ck301l1,t3_2etva7,null,1427312062,8,false,standrews,t5_2st3h,8

Club president Massimo Cellino said: “I’d like to thank David for his efforts over the last two and a half months but the results since the start of the season have meant we needed to act and make this decision. 
“After the defeat at Bradford I realised that my decision to keep David at the club following the defeat at Watford was wrong and I had to change my mind on the coaches position. 
“As a club we will now begin our search for a new head coach.”

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; A PhD does not necessarily have anything to do with science...

Scientists were just an example. If I had hypothesized that theology PhDs might be disrespected, would that mean I was assuming scientists couldn't earn PhDs?

&gt; A PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) is theoretically, formal recognition that the holder is an expert in their field, that they are an authority on it such that they have a license to teach it, and that their opinion is considered equally amongst those others in their field.

Which is relevant in their field, but doesn't mean they're entitled to special consideration everywhere they go.

Furthermore, a symbol is just a symbol - not the thing it represents. Insisting on the title can mean you're insisting on formality, and thereby rejecting informal, personal friendliness. IOW it can mean you're rejecting a kind of respect, and being disrespectful. People decide how and when people show respect - it's part cultural, part individual, part context.

&gt; So, yes, it is a prestigious achievement, and not just a frivolous change to someone's title, as it does hold importance and significance.

I didn't say it was frivolous. There are many non-frivolous contributions that a person can make through hard work that don't confer special titles, academic or otherwise.

&gt; To call a medical doctor a doctor whilst denying a holder of a PhD the title is not just ignorant it's disrespectful - no more or less disrespectful than denying a hard working tradesman their own letters after their names.

No. Words change meaning over time, and aren't decided by a rulebook. For example dictionary compilers record how language is used - they don't have a special right to control the language. A medical doctor is a doctor in the sense of the role he is playing, assuming you're visiting for medical reasons. The word may be no more significant than ""garcon"" for a waiter. In any case, AFAIK most doctors don't expect to be called ""doctor"" all the time.

&gt; no more or less disrespectful than denying a hard working tradesman their own letters after their names.

I don't know any tradesmen who expect people to use letters after their name. My father probably technically has some, given his training, but I don't remember him ever telling me what they are. I probably could technically claim some academic letters after my name, but I never checked because that would be stupid, irrespective of what any rulebook might say.

For PhD, in a context where formality was appropriate and the PhD is relevant, sure - it's just polite to use a formal title, assuming you know it, at least initially. But when people said they wouldn't use those letters, no-one ever even bothered to ask if they were likely to ever be in such a context.

They bring in quite a lot of tourism (just go to america and look through their magazines, absolutely full of the royals) as people want to see a ""living, ruling queen"".  I think people underestimate how much tourists bring into the country.

I also feel that they provide a certain amount of checks and balances with regards to parliament, although this is probably an illusion.  I sort of see it as a friendly old woman who still runs her family owned business, but a ruthless, moronic CEO is brought in every 4 years.  The CEO is desperate for short term appearance of improvements and will go to any length, whereas ol' lady queeny is in it for the long haul.

I feel sorry for them though, for the main cast it's a full time and probably exhausting job, the supporting cast have a much easier time of it though and benefit from their wealth.  Personally I'd absolutely hate to be a royal.

The season we were in the champions league he bossed Inter and AC next to Modric. In the 12/13 season him and Dembele were also statistically the best CM pairing for the first 10-15 games. Sadly like most of our great players he's suffered from injuries and hasn't hit his top form for a while, on his day he is immense.

1.  I'm assuming Dier is being held out because he will get a start at RB (if Walker's out) or CB.  Though if Walker is out, Dier is going to get the start over Naughton and presumably Fazio will start over Kaboul.

2.  I'd say this is an audition for Sandro and Paulinho.  Moving Paulinho around suggests Poch isn't sure how to use him yet.  

3.  Townsend is being forced to be a Left Winger even though he thinks he is Bale 2.0.  Basically what everyone here was screaming last year, moving him to the Left should cut down on poor shot decisions.

4.  We are probably the shallowest at ST.  Kane played some Sunday, and Ade is his backup today.   Are there no other youth players that are ready to be a 3rd choice ST?",0,1409250938,null,0,false,0,ck30uh9,t3_2euajp,t1_ck30uh9,t3_2euajp,null,1427311474,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8
true,Lirael,cnty-expat,Expat in USA,"We do. I just find it unfortunate that any point that you disagree with, you label as ignorance rather than a difference of opinion. You said yourself there are two sides to this argument, but you are completely dismissive of the side that isn't yours. In a different comment you said that British people think guns are unnecessary because they are taught to fear them, and that is patently untrue, you're making assumptions. British people feel guns are unnecessary because we live without them on a daily basis and we find that they *are* unnecessary. We have no problems that we feel gun ownership would fix. I suspect most of us feel they are more trouble than they're worth, and we have seen little evidence to the contrary.

I am in a position to see both sides of this argument, and I do - my father in law is a huge gun nut, he has probably 40 of them locked up in a safe in his house because he's a responsible dude. He hunts deer and I respect that. He took me out into the countryside in Colorado and I shot at a pumpkin and had a jolly old time. Granted I got a bit freaked out when I shot the .44 but that's only because the recoil scared the shit out of me. I still don't think guns are necessary, surprise!

true,sivogt,null,null,"Hi

I have a similar situation to you, but i was working in the US and have moved back to the UK but am still employed by the US company and paid based on a USD salary.

I had a couple of options as to how to take it from there - i.e. take it in USD and have it paid into my USD HSBC expat account (as already recommended), if I were to have chosen to have the salary paid in USD I could have also had a USD account arranged by First Direct with whom I do my UK banking (in reality though this would have been an HSBC account). However mainly for tax reasons my employer pays me based on the USD salary but it is wire transferred to me in the UK in GBP based on the wholesale rate at the moment of transfer.

Although there is an element of risk in doing this in terms of ex rate exposure I am happy to accept that at this time.

This also makes it simpler for me from an tax perspective as I have GBP coming into my account gross of UK tax and I am responsible for my own tax and NI through the direct payment scheme, being paid directly in USD  would just add another level of record keeping on past exchange rates each time that I get paid that I cannot really be bothered with. 

As I also need GBP to do all the boring stuff like paying the tax man and the mortgage - if I had USD being paid into a USD account I would still occasionally need to convert USD to GBP anyway.

In summary the options of HSBC expat and other USD accounts (Citibank UK etc) are available and I have had no difficulties with HSBC expat over the past few years but if you are in the UK and responsible for your own tax the option of taking the salary in GBP is still potentially worth it.

I reflashed the standard BIOS straight after because I wasn't 100% confident what I was doing and it's back to stock now. 

Amazon have a really good returns policy so if it's under 30 days from you getting the item they generally don't care *why* you return stuff. It's only sellers on Amazon who are independent that aren't as good. Scan.co.uk wouldn't accept the case in return (which in all honesty I don't blame them but if you don't ask and all that).

I know stuff isn't tested together as there's millions of combinations so it's just not possible to do. Still, the stuff I managed to pick doesn't work properly together for whatever reason. That under my opinion counts as not fit for purpose (because their purpose is to work, and they aren't) so I'm entitled to exchange or get a refund.

That's not true. There are four cases: 

- In 1964, the Scottish vote changed a minority Tory government to a Labour majority government.

- In 1974, there were two elections. In the first, the Scottish vote turned a Tory minority government into a Labour minority government. This government lasted 8 months because the two parties were so close. 

- In the second, the Scottish vote allowed the creation of a Labour majority government rather than a Labour minority government.

- In 2010, the Scottish vote prevented a Tory majority government and forced a Tory minority government instead. [Source.](http://deadclydeside.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/the-scottish-vote-at-general-elections/)

Its a bit of a difficult argument though, because all this tells us is Scotland (like Wales and Northern Ireland) is a small minority in the overall UK population. The only exception to this is of course England. In that respect there is no real solution. Federalisation means an English majority, much like comparing Malta to Germany in the EU. 

The only theoretical way would be to breakup the UK into many different regions and then federalise. That breakup would have to not account for current borders, i.e. create regions that include bits of England and Scotland, England and Wales, and Eng/Scot/Wales and Northern Ireland. But that is so far from happening its not worth considering.",0,1409252385,null,0,false,0,ck31mek,t3_2et6f3,t1_ck31mek,t1_ck3142x,null,1427310929,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

I just think we're at the point where Sandro has done what he needed to do for us and that Capoue, though he hasnt played much or proved himself yet, has the same sort of style as Sandro has and can do more for us.

According to quotes on one of the [Ecology Building Society's pages](http://www.ecology.co.uk/blog/index.php/2014/08/treehuggers-why-were-fighting-to-save-the-silsden-lime-tree/),

&gt; Removal of this tree is totally unacceptable.

On their [press release](http://www.ecology.co.uk/news/press-releases/142/aldi_destroys_250-year-old_tree_ecology_building_society_comment), they also note
&gt; The lime tree felled by Aldi was estimated by Bradford Council’s tree specialist as being 250 years old and of historical significance.

edit: looking at an overhead image of the site on Google Maps - https://goo.gl/maps/oWds7 - I think it's fairly clear it went because it gave Aldi an easier area of land to work with.

&gt; I really like the way the fixtures go too. We start off at home against arguably the weakest team in the Champions league. If things go to plan we walk out with three points and our nerves settled a bit.

Then we get two shots to take points off Real and then end with two matches we should be able to get points from.

&gt; Much better than starting on the road to Real and getting rattled. Or so my analysis in my head says.

And then seeing our League Schedule around that time I'm even more pleased.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"That's certainly what the media and those responsible for the systemic failure would like us to think. It's not the whole story by any means. 

Children from the underclass, in local authority care or from dysfunctional families are treated with utter disdain by the police and local authority. They are vulnerable to abuse because no-one cares about them, no-one will listen to them. Certainly no-one was willing to rock the boat or risk their career just for a handful of children viewed as the dregs of society. 

In this particular case the abusers were Pakistani Muslims because they had cash for fags and booze, because they could get their mates elected to the council, and because they could rely on their community to close ranks. 

Next time the abusers could well be from a different ethnic group entirely. And there will be a next time, especially if we buy the idea that this is purely a problem with the Pakistani Muslim community, and fail to address the way we treat children from the underclass.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"During the independence settlement negotiations the rUK will have to negotiate with whomever represents the new Scottish government to agree on the future of the North Sea oil industry. Oil 'ownership' will be determined by two main factors;

* **Maritime borders**. As it currently stands there is no strict legal distinction between The waters of the UKs nations. There is a framework that might be used (as it was used for fisheries) but there is no legal requirement to do it this way. By most likely methods the Scots would get something in the region of 75-90% of the seabed containing the oil. However the industry is well established and the oil prospects are already licensed out to companies with contracts the Scottish government will have to honour. So profits would only be from taxation. 

* **Separate Oil Negotiation**. This is often ignored by the SNP, but it's likely the Scots will actually negotiate away either ownership or profits from **some** of their newly owned oil in exchange for big UK concessions on things that will be extremely important to them like currency and EU membership.

Other important things to remember are that currently we only know what the **SNP** want to negotiate. The assumption in Scotland is that the SNP will get to negotiate if Scots vote yes... But the reality might be very different, since legally speaking Westminster can decide who it wants to negotiate with. The only legal commitment Westminster has made is to honour the outcome, which itself is very vague. It's also important to consider that if the outcome on September 18th is a surprise yes vote, it's likely to be by an extraordinarily narrow margin, of perhaps just 0.5-1% of voters. So that means whoever negotiates the settlement on Scotland's behalf will also be doing it for the approximately 48% of voters who didn't actually vote for independence. Consequently, once their views are taken into account, it's likely the actual aspirations of **the Scots** (i.e. Not just the SNP)  will be much more moderate than the left of centre SNP vision. Right leaning Scots (of which contrary to popular belief there are many) will likely want to retain strong UK connections and will probably be prepared to make big concessions to achieve it.

At the end of the day, **IF** Scots vote a surprise yes, then for every 100 voters, 48 of them will be doing what 51 thought was best... At the very least this referendum will be incredibly divisive not just now but well into Scotland's future. I'm not sure many Scots realise just what a *Pandora's box* they're about to open by doing this... Because it creates a situation where there are going to be a large number of *losers* regardless of the specific outcome. It's also where the real weakness in the SNPs campaign lies, since the only vision of independence they have put forward is their own left of centre social-democrat vision.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; I think it's quite possible that Islam increases the probability of child abuse, yes.

Let me re-frame that for you in what I would think is a more healthy fashion. Your argument is that the texts of Islam are so misogynistic and laissez-faire in regards to the treatment of women and children that they make someone more likely to abuse children. I think on paper that's a reasonable premise.

Alright, here is the re-frame. Religious texts are ancient texts and ancient people were more likely to be misogynistic pricks who would sell their children into slavery and treated people as property.  
What if I were to posit that being religious and being ""into"" the ancient books made one more likely to abuse children as opposed to it being specifically about Islam?  
My point being that Christianity and Hinduism and all sorts of other religions have the same bullshit within them. I personally think the height of misogyny is from Hinduism, a practice known as Sati:  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(practice)  

Funnily enough (re: Sati) the Mughal (Muslim) rulers of India tried to actually ban it when they were in charge. I personally think this helps demonstrate one of my underlying themes which is that it isn't specific religions that matter but how the followers choose to interpret their religion at a given time.

In the report by Professor Alexis Jay, the one that highlighted this whole thing, she notes how the research team reached out to one victim whos brother had his legs broken by gangs because she threatened to go to the police. They finally convinced her to go to the police station and give evidence, but when she arrived she received a text from one of the perpetrators who claimed he was with her little sister, followed by the words: ""Your choice ..."". She walked out and declined to speak to the detectives.

I don't think it's nearly as simple as just as just 'taking things into your own hands'. It's organized crime, people need the help of the police and government to stand up to these thugs and, it has to be said, both police and government have failed massively here.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Just to point something out - the number of people in private schools is fairly irrelevant when talking about jobs like judges or civil servants etc. For most if not all of those top jobs you NEED a good degree from a decent university. As this article point's out 63% of the population didn't go to university instantly making them ineligible for those top jobs however concerned the employer may be about inequality or elitism. If you're a senior judge you need a law degree - 63% of the country are thus immediately ineligible for that position. 

The real question is what proportion of the university educated population went to private school. In general from what I can find the figure seems to vary quite drastically from 20% to 40% with Oxbridge in the 40s. In other words, if a profession has a proportion of privately educated people within these general bounds then they are taking a fair representation of applicants from all backgrounds because they have to take applicants holding degrees - a random selection of students in university in the UK would include between 20 and 40% privately educated students with no positive or negative discrimination. The journalism and civil service numbers are much less shocking when you take this into account with their numbers being about 10% too high rather than 30 or 40. Judges are still way out but anyone that thought the culture in barristers chambers was anything but antiquated needs their heads examining - it also has a huge problem with a lack of women in the profession, hopefully both problems will be sorted in time.

But the point I'm trying to make is a secondary school educated person with no other education will find it very hard to get into these jobs whether they went to private school or not. The higher academic pressures in some private school means more private school kids are pushed to go to uni and so all along private school kids are pushed to aim for these jobs. It's not the uni's fault necessarily nor is it necessarily the employer's fault. It's a systemic problem that involves the fact that many of the people that don't go to uni don't want to (and have no need to) and voluntarily avoid some of these professions which are being blamed for not hiring some of these people.

Other companies will gloss over the lack of a 2:2 if you can demonstrate an ability greater than that of your peers. Having a 2:2 isn't a distinct disadvantage but you'll need to be able to prove you have an ability above and beyond the other applicants with a 2:2.

Like... I'm of the strong opinion that religion isn't a thing that is inherently one way or the other but just a leash and how the dog operates is completely at the behest of the one in charge of the leash as opposed to what is written on it.

&gt; However, there is a significant constituency in Northern Ireland who are quietly living in a ‘shared  now’.  They do not make the headlines, they do not call into radio shows, they may not yet be in power; but for them a shared future is no longer an ambition but a reality. 

This is a fairly fluffy and meaningless statement; the much talked about silent majority has failed as always to make an appearance or any impact on elections here. There are more ""peacelines"" now than when the GFA was signed.


&gt; Their work place is diverse; not through any form of cross community initiative but through a natural evolution.

Natural Evolution? Is this guy for real? I guess Stephen may be too young or Naive to remember the [MacBride Principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBride_Principles) or the long hard push of the Trade Union movement to get Fair Employment legislation.


&gt; The last census showed that 29% of respondents saw being ‘Northern Irish’ as their national identity, either  in conjunction with another identity or on its own. It would be a worthwhile piece of research to delve into the 29% Northern Irish population and to see whether this is a shared identity across traditional communities. If so it could be a key indicator of the scale of the ‘shared now’.

The Myth that describing oneself as ""Northern Irish"" eschews tribal politics is a nonsense; that it is somehow a more progressive than stating that one is Irish or British. Apportioning worth on self identities at which ""Northern Irish"" is the highest point of shared progressive morality; Even a cursory glance at the history of this statelet would tell you that the term is loaded with baggage, the current attempts to whitewash the ""Northern Irish"" identity as an innocuous and innocent term are unconvincing. As an identity it is closely associated with your socio-economic background, in every sense it is default unionism or unionism lite. Anything else is ghastly tribal politics; this negates genuinely held aspirations of a United Ireland. Quite simply it is an attempt to remove other equally valid political opinions from the public discourse.

&gt;

&gt;__BK Chicken Fries__ are a [fried chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_chicken) product sold by the international [fast-food restaurant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-food_restaurant) chain [Burger King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King). According to Burger King marketing, it was one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their ""standard"" menu items.  Additionally, the product further targeted the *[snacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack)* and *[convenience food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_food)* markets.

&gt;Chicken Fries were part of a series of products designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24–36 adult males.  Along with the [TenderGrill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TenderGrill), [TenderCrisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TenderCrisp) and [Angus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Angus_burger_(Burger_King\)) sandwiches, these products were intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products.  They were discontinued in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) in 2012, but continue to be sold in some markets, such as Italy.  As of August 11, 2014, they have been reintroduced for a limited time.

Student loans aren't available, and it's going to be near impossible to hold down any kind of paid work on top of full-time study *and* a placement.  In some cases the NHS will pay off a bunch of the fees, but not all, and you still have to factor in 2 years worth of living expenses - when I contacted the universities to ask for advice they basically told me to deal with it.

Experian say

&gt;  Contact Experian’s Customer Support 
Centre and order a copy of your credit 
report because they might be able to 
help. For example, you could add a 
note (called a notice of correction) to 
your report explaining that you cannot 
register on the electoral register 
because you are not eligible to vote in 
UK or EU elections. You can also say 
in this note that you have documents 
to prove where you live and how long 
you have lived there. Then, when you 
apply for financial services in the 
future, any organisation looking at your 
report will see this note and hopefully take account of it. The note will mean 
that any credit application you make 
may take the lender a little longer than 
normal to deal with. But it may be 
worth the short delay if it helps you get 
credit when you want it. You may want 
to contact the other credit reference 
agencies to add a note to the reports 
they hold on you as well. You will find 
their details at the end of this guide.

&gt;The report also described how social workers and council chiefs were quick to dismiss the concerns of parents who were attempting to protect their children.  

&gt;In one case in 2002 a mother contacted social services to voice concerns that her 14-year-old daughter was going missing regularly and was being plied with drink by older males.  
Her mother said she was worried that her daughter had become sexually active with members of the group.  
But despite showing signs that she had been sexually exploited from the age of 11, the case was closed and the social worker’s assessment was that the mother was unable to accept the fact that her daughter was growing up.

&gt;**While the police often failed to take action against the abusers, there were cases where concerned parents were arrested for trying to protect their own children.

There is a song. It's called ""everything's political"". Seemed vaguely apt to reference with my post.

&gt; OK, I don't know how you reached the conclusion that religion doesn't foster tribalism.

I'd argue the inverse. Its united continents against each other and works on homogenizing disparate peoples into one group.  Europe would be a good example of this.  

Its the politics of religion that result in furthering tribalism (""true"" muslims, etc). An example might be the iconoclastic crisis in Christianity between the Orthodox and Catholic.

is not usually a question asked by the book but by those deciding what goes into the new version of the book or what a passage in the book _really_ means.

true,EmpyrealSorrow,eng-Surrey,Migrant to the Mersey,"&gt; Scientists were just an example. If I had hypothesized that theology PhDs might be disrespected, would that mean I was assuming scientists couldn't earn PhDs?

No, but the general assumption is that PhD equates to science, and it sounded like you were going down the same route.

&gt; Which is relevant in their field, but doesn't mean they're entitled to special consideration everywhere they go.

&gt; Furthermore, a symbol is just a symbol - not the thing it represents. Insisting on the title can mean you're insisting on formality, and thereby rejecting informal, personal friendliness. IOW it can mean you're rejecting a kind of respect, and being disrespectful. People decide how and when people show respect - it's part cultural, part individual, part context.

Whilst a PhD is considered an expert in their field, the connotation is that they have a proven ability to reason and consider, to innovate... Originally they likely would hold academic positions, so holding positions of authority, teaching a range of subjects, and so on. The title marks this position.

I totally agree with your second paragraph, here... I don't know many people who would insist that they be called Dr this or Professor that, but that says more about our community and how open and receptive most people are. In other cultures you would address someone else with their full honorific and respect their contributions, whatever they are - not necessarily because bthey demand it (although many no doubt do) but that's just the way it is. If you wanted you could insist on being called Mr (or whatever your title is), and it would be exceptionally rude for someone to subsequently call you by your first name. 

&gt;No. Words change meaning over time, and aren't decided by a rulebook. For example dictionary compilers record how language is used - they don't have a special right to control the language. A medical doctor is a doctor in the sense of the role he is playing, assuming you're visiting for medical reasons. The word may be no more significant than ""garcon"" for a waiter. In any case, AFAIK most doctors don't expect to be called ""doctor"" all the time.

I'm not sure what your point is here. The current social definitions of doctor and its application as a title are quite clear.

&gt;For PhD, in a context where formality was appropriate and the PhD is relevant, sure - it's just polite to use a formal title, assuming you know it, at least initially. But when people said they wouldn't use those letters, no-one ever even bothered to ask if they were likely to ever be in such a context.

This is literally all I'm saying. And the initial comment indicated that /u/estanmilko wouldn't call someone a doctor unless (the implication being) they were a medical doctor. All replies are trying to point out that holders of a doctorate have every much as right to use the title.",0,1409258167,null,0,false,0,ck34qga,t3_2et6f3,t1_ck34qga,t1_ck30gds,null,1427309261,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Tonight we saw plenty of players who hadn’t yet debuted this year and a few who were able to play well and hopefully carry that on to premier league games. For example, both Paulinho and Andros played much better after their goals and hopefully that’s something that can carry on to the league, but overall the lads looked really good.  

If poch can manage the squad right, the Europa league will a great place to get the whole squad playing and produce the best squad possible for the league. Plus the chance for champions league and a trophy doesn’t hurt.

""Nonsense.  Cancer has many causes which have nothing to do with smoking.  Also, there are millions of smokers who *don't* have cancer, so it's quite unfair to claim that there's a link.

Those who see this through to the end are then rich enough to send their kids to private school, and so the whole cycle continues.

Of course it's not quite so cut-and-dried, it's still possible to fall off this ladder, but it's not very easy to climb on; and of course, the later you get through life the harder it gets.  The problem is the cut-off is very early, a smart state-school kid could get to Oxbridge, but a middle-ranking university graduate will never be hired by the top-tier investment banks, no matter how smart they are.

Not that that's a bad thing automatically, because these five-ten-fifteen year long ""up-or-out"" careers these places have are specifically designed to exploit the type of personality that climbed the greasy pole to get to the right college in Oxbridge, joining the right clubs.  It's only at the very end of such a scheme does anything like a proper job emerge at the end.  But still, it's a door that's closed to most people.

What do you think happens to your waste when it's removed and all the shit you've thrown out is dumped somewhere and becomes somebody elses problem? It becomes the tax payers problem, because the land has to be purchased, the waste site has to be managed (very expensive), and since all land fills leak, and I mean, every last one of them, the water table will be affected too. It also becomes the local residents problem, for at least another 100 years.

I'm not defending the council here, but I'm not going to rush to criticize them either. We're all part of a community, and when you see overflowing bins there are people putting that shit in there, wasting packaging, not managing their recycling effectively, and probably always having excuses why they shouldn't have to do it. 

It's your neighbors that are making your street a shitty place to live on, and if the council took it away in time you'd just be making some other place a shitty place to live. Like Kirknewton. Take a stroll up to Dalmahoy Hill, a former landfill site, and you'll see the machinery and pipes managing the noxious gases festering under the ground. There's about 200,000 tones of waste in there. There's an active landfill near Musselburgh with a capacity of 2,000,000. That's a lot of shit that probably doesn't need to be there.

Blaming the council is not the answer.

Pros:

I thought Kane and Chiriches were absolutely fantastic.

Paulinho showed great movement and and pressing. Though was not always the best on the ball.

Cons:

I don't think Sandro really adds enough to the team. Great tackling as always but looked slightly off the pace.

Lennon and Townsend really need to learn to hurt teams more. Townsend in particular looked like a man under pressure.

&gt;The __Coco__ (or __Cuco__, __Coca__, __Cuca__, __Cucuy__) is a mythical [ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost)-[monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster), equivalent to the [bogeyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogeyman), found in many [Hispanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic) and [Lusophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusophone) countries. He can also be considered a Hispanic version of a [bugbear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugbear),  as it is a commonly used figure of speech representing an irrational or exaggerated fear. The Coco is a male being while Coca is the female version of the mythical [monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster), although it is not possible to distinguish one from the other as both are the representation of the same being.

If you use the Gregorian calendar, Jesus was born before 4BC because historians agree that's when Herod died. 

And if you remember your bible class, Mary and Big Joe had to go to Bethlehem on an Ass to sign the census which Herod had called earlier that year. 

BTW Jesus' birth has little to do with atheism. Many atheists, like myself, agree that Jesus did exist, but he was more of a Gandhi figure. Someone who went about preaching crazy ideas like Love thy Neighbour and look after poor people. We just don't believe that he was a higher being in a spiritual sense.

I also made in another post that the general consensus is that we have one direct AML, one AMC and our AMR Lamela cutting inside. So that means Eriksen HAS to be AMC, and Chadli Townsend AML. I disagree - the player positions vs QPR shows that Chadli even played ontop of the other 2 and was more central. 

So Eriksen (with Davies behind him for stablity) roaming from AML, Holtby pressing from AMC and Lamela is mouthwatering. Especially with Capoue/Bentaleb or possibly Capoue/Schneiderlin - a rock solid 2 behind them just distributing the ball well forwards letting them run riot. Let Levy work his magic with Townsend/Southampton - get Schneiderlin in. Then have Eriksen (who can also cross) roaming from AML, Holtby as AMC and Lamela at AMR. With Chadli / Oduwa / Some other youth prospect as our direct AML. 

If Poch isn't as keen on that - still do the Townsend/Schneiderlin deal, and with our low net spend and profit every year...chuck a few million at a truly talented AML. Test the waters...I can think of a few names it might be worth throwing some cash at ;) Welbeck certainly is not one of them, he's looked so average and gangly on the wing (for England, anyway).

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;  it's just the fact that liberals are so averse to saying ethnic minorities might actually do something bad.

The trouble with Authoritarians (or whatever you want to call the opposite of a liberal) is that they are too quick to blame race (or religion) in situations like this.  In the same way we don't suggest that all 1980s TV presenters were attacking young girls and boys, that 80s and 90s politicians didn't all do the same (allegedly), that we don't suggest that all Catholic priests are preying on young boys (I'm sure the list could go on), we don't suggest that all Muslim, Pakistani or Asian men in Rotherham are predators.

What the liberals tend to do is focus on the ways of solving this, which is why this article is as true as it ever was:

&gt; Meanwhile, the sunlight of investigative inquiry has yet to shine on our legal system which, all agencies agree, fails to cater to the needs of children who – groomed into acquiescence by practised abusers of all creeds and colours – don't present as the perfect victims our limited version of justice demands.

In this case the people with power were mostly of Asian of origin (and probably Pakistani and probably Muslim), but if it hadn't been them, then someone else would have been in there because we fail to protect young women and young men who are in and out of social services and foster care.

true,ThePhenix,lancashire,MCR/Bristol,"Loyalty is the last thing you owe a country. Sure, all of these things might seem fine and dandy to you, but the UK's rapidly becoming more unequal.


Child benefit decreasing - more expensive to have kids.

Tuition fees increasing - because charging to educate your future workforce and stimulate research is a bad idea. Plus, all you old guard who got university free (and even got paid to go there with all your fancy grants)

NHS carvery - yep, it's done a fine job, but now it's being cherry-picked and parceled off to private companies. what a great national asset that is.

Infrastructure - stifling lack of investment and renovation means transport is becoming overpriced and overcongested, whether you use a car or 'public' transport, you're charged out of your arse for it.

The London-mentality - Granted, the North-West is seeing some limted revival, but if you want real prospects, and a city that actually works, London is the only option. For those who are outpriced or dislike this city, you're screwed.

Politics - Any country that can seriously consider pulling itself out of its human rights obligations has its priorities seriously wrong, and many enlightened individuals see that as dangerous, and rightly so. Plus, the system is weighted so that it will always trend towards two main parties (not exactly a beacon of democracy now is it?), with very little scope for change or effect on the local level. Scotland's bid for independence is the only real chance for true social (not socialist) democracy in the current UK.

___

Let's take for example Germany and see what it has to offer in exchange:

Free state education, university enrollment may have a small admin fee but that's it. Much investment in research and development, and a significant remaining manufacturing base to act out any progress.

Infrastructure - largely state controlled with private investment in some parts, but almost never run-down

Political system - 2 elected houses, proportional and FPTP, ensures national proportional representation of MANY parties as well as producing strong stable parliaments. Federal devolution ensures the protection of state identities (ergo: no independence referendums) as well as regional experimentation in laws

Slightly more expensive healthcare system (perhaps the biggest downside to Germany) with many people having private insurance, but on the whole still preferable to American style 'care'

Germany has many cities, each with their own flavour, but more importantly, their importance is not too unequal. Berlin, of course, is the capital and centre of political life, but much administration is still done in Bonn I believe, Frankfurt is the financial capital, Hamburg is a major port and cultural site, Cologne has vast telecommunications potential, and the Ruhrgebiet surrounding Dusseldorf bases a huge manufacturing zone.


Take a look at your options, and emigration starts to look very appealing indeed.

Yes, and I'm very familiar with this argument. But what if the psycho had no access to a gun? You say he would kill people with something else. How many people will he manage to kill with a melee weapon before he is stopped? A lot less, I'd wager.

What I mean by this is not that we should de-prioritise education, obviously it's important, but it's adult-life social mobility that's a problem too.  Otherwise those that are born poor will die poor and have poor kids, there needs to be ways out of that at each point in the chain.

For example, the standard UK dream-career path: school -&gt; Oxbridge -&gt; high-level banking/consulting -&gt; bonuses -&gt; buy a house -&gt; small business ticking over a few million for ad-hoc work.

Standard US dream-career path: school -&gt; college (for a bit) -&gt; startup (possibly more than one) -&gt; big exit to a life of philanthropy or not to head up a global empire.

Enabling entrepreneurship is a way out of the ""elitist"" trap (although elitist is the wrong word for what we're seeing here).  But entrepreneurship is also a path that the ""elite"" can do more easily than the rest (this will probably always be true, but we could try to make it such a barrier).

Random related anecdote: I remember flicking through a book written by the founder of one of the main coffee chains.  The book was entitled ""Anyone can do it"" was was subtitled ""rules of entrepreneurs"" or something along those lines.  I quickly put it down again after reading the first page which went something like (from memory, after several years): ""I love the coffee you get in New York on our regular trips there, why don't we sell that in London?  Yes, good idea, I'll phone my friend Bob who's a partner at Goldman Sachs, and see if he'll sort out our funding!""

true,portable_door,null,null,"It depends what you mean by equivalent and which ESOL qualification you have.

One answer: no. They are two separate qualifications with different discount codes and you cannot use your ESOL in place of an English qualification.

Another answer: yes. Depending on what qualification you did, a pass for ESOL is roughly equivalent to a B, but it depends what board you did it with, etc. This is for *you*, though. Your school cannot claim any points from you doing this qualification as it is not on the list of approved performance tables qualifications from 2014 onwards. (I should however stress that ESOL is in Section 96, so it is an approved qualification from the DfE).

Generally I like to shy away from terms like ""equivalent"", because you got the qualification you got - it's not a GCSE, it's not a BTEC, it is what it is. However, I understand that it can sometimes help potential employers understand it a bit more. But still, I don't like it. :/

Edit: to add, if by ESOL you mean the iGCSE English as a Second Language and not the ESOL Certificate then disregard all above and yeah, pretty much it is equivalent points-wise (they're both graded A*-G).

Finding tenants, keeping an eye on the property, making repairs, fixing the place up between tenants. An agent can do that for you but they charge a lot for it, and they don't really give a shit about someone else's property.

Then there is the risk of a bad tenant, who stops paying the rent, or trashes the place. That can cost you several years worth of net profit.

I thought you were saying that they were saying that overtly.

There are two aspects to the story - the nature of the perpetrators and the piss-poor response from the authorities. The Guardian commentators are basically choosing to concentrate on the latter - perhaps because of nervousness over racism, but more charitably because they feel the race issue has been covered to an extent, whereas the institutional failings and the fact that victims were dismissed hasn't had quite so much analysis in the rest of the media.

Well, I was assuming that anti-science conspiracy theorists might go down the same route.

&gt; Whilst a PhD is considered an expert in their field, the connotation is that they have a proven ability to reason and consider, to innovate...

I'm (dimly) aware of that - a PhD. is definitely not a recite-back-what-you-were-taught qualification, which is an important reason why it's not just about teaching. Of course ""real-world"" experience can deserve respect too, though I'm aware that by saying ""real-world"" I'm being misleading.

&gt; This is literally all I'm saying. And the initial comment indicated that /u/estanmilko wouldn't call someone a doctor unless (the implication being) they were a medical doctor. All replies are trying to point out that holders of a doctorate have every much as right to use the title.

Well, I decided to argue one side rather than the other, so yes - I took sides and was not impartial or fair. Even so, you're still taking the use of the word ""doctor"" for a medical doctor as an honorific, whereas I for one think of it more like calling out ""hi postie!"" to get the postmans attention. Sure, medical doctors are (theoretically) respected but that doesn't mean the word is about respect. He's doing a job, the word is the job title (well, sort-of), sometimes we use job titles as stand-ins for names.

Also, the original context seemed to be about they way the person used the title, not the mere fact of using it, though I admit i didn't do much checking (and still haven't).

Because even a cursory search throws up [this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/10075544/Which-university-has-the-most-public-school-pupils.html?frame=2292806) which shows Oxbridge as being around 60% former state school pupils. So the majority of people  there are not from elite backgrounds. Furthermore, what do you class as an ordinary background? My school was a fairly good state school, I'll grant you, but  given that I went to school in the same town as a very well-established private school, that hoovered up all the posh kids whose parents were from the elite backgrounds we could be classed as fairly average. Around the national average for exam results, certainly. We still got several people into Oxbridge each year, from a year group size of roughly 100, and most of the rest of those went to good universities.

The idea that they're exclusive clubs that only allow the already privileged in is nonsense. Of the three people I know who went, two were from families where their parents didn't attend university. People like yourself who spread the idea that there's no point in trying because you're from a 'normal' background are why people don't bother applying and why Cambridge has to run [a summer school program](http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/access/year12summerschool/) to convince people that it's actually within their reach when they come from a state school.

I applied, I got rejected, it's not because I'm from a 'normal' background, it's because I'm a lazy shit who couldn't (and still can't) be arsed to achieve my potential, got poor AS results and looked likely to not get the three A grades I would have needed to get in at the time. Surprise surprise, I didn't (AACC and a decent Russell group uni for me). Most people who go to top universities either worked hard or are naturally academically gifted - they're littered with Oxbridge rejects like me. Those who put the work in on top of their smarts get to go to Oxbridge. You shouldn't expect to get in off of the back of one or the other.

Yeah, we're treading old ground again. We could get trapped into going around in circles with hypothetical situations forever, but we can at least agree it's two different approaches to the same problem and both have their good and bad points.

&gt;It's great that this works for the culture of the UK and people are good with it, but I could see legislation like this starting another civil war in America before it's ever introduced. 

Me too, and this is precisely the reason why I am against a gun ban in the USA. It wouldn't work, it would almost certainly create violent conflict and ultimately more people would be hurt than helped. Our views differ in many ways, but on this you and I are on the same page. Good post.

If we still had Cold War levels of arms against Russia in the way it is now I'd want air strikes on Russian bases right along their European border and tens of thousands of troops in the Ukraine. The escalation risk from that would be far more tangible and dangerous.

The only acceptable alternative I can think of is to draw a very clear line in the sand and 'pact up' so that further military action from Russia - especially outside of Ukraine leads to certain military retaliation from NATO. Again that's a significant risk of escalation but it's the only way I see to prevent salami tactics.

The fact of the matter is, Oxbridge degrees are harder to obtain and are extremely well regarded almost across the board, except in very specific vocational subjects like medicine. A degree in, say, History from Oxford or Cambridge is worth more than the same degree from almost any other university. The work is light years harder, the teaching practices are far more focused and the curriculum goes deeper. Saying it's elitist to recognise that some degrees are worth more than others is pretty much the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Discriminating on university choice? That's the whole point! You also get 'discriminated against' on experience, exam performance and a million other things, all through your life. Are you not familiar with interviews? They're the process by which people are selected over others due to better qualifications, better training, more experience, better social manners etc and they all 'discriminate'.

Here's a scenario for you. You're advertising for an engineer. You get two candidates for interview who have the same amount of experience and both come across really well. One of them has a degree from MIT and the other from Bob's Discount Engineering Shack (Coney Island Campus). I can only imagine that faced with this choice you would be paralysed to make a decision, because to pick one over the other on the basis of their degree would be serious discrimination.

Adil Rashid, who had “raped” an underage girl, was spared a prison term after the judge heard that the naïve 18-year-old attended an Islamic faith school where he was taught that women are worthless. Rashid told psychologists he had no idea that having sex with a willing 13-year-old was against the law; besides, his education had taught him to believe that “women are no more worthy than a lollipop that has been dropped on the ground”.

I disagree with that entirely. 

When the catholic priest sex scandal came to light, everyone was talking about how it was the culture of the church, and the culture of being a priest which lead to their behaviour. Celibacy ect. It WAS because of their culture that they acted in the way they did, and everyone accepted that. 

So why is it wrong to discuss the fact that the cultural background of these men played a part in why they did what they did?

Politics: My own version of events here, 2014  Scotland declares independence from the UK, 2034 Oil reserves in Scotland have depleted, Scotland goes bankrupt and requests reentry into the UK, a referendum is held in England to decide, England declines Scotland request with 98.7 percent rejecting the motion with 88 percent voter turn out, Scotland becomes a failed state and descends into lawlessness, 2035 prime minister Anjem Farage signs the 'Defence of England' act, a 2 billion pound grant to reconstruct hadrians wall to prevent masses of now uneducated feral Scots seeping through the border. English nationalism sky rockets as a result and calls for English independence rise slowly but surely until a referendum is held in 2039, England votes for independence following a 72.1 percent voting yes. Shortly after a now short but decisive event now known as 'the Westminster incident' occurred, several hundred Unite against fascism, anti nazi league, Islamists and Socialist workers party members attempted a coup d'etat by storming the houses of parliament and refusing to leave until the UK was restored. The English Government set fire to the building killing everyone inside and then rebuilt the new English parliament in York. Wales no longer being subsidised by rUK struggles to survive and erupts into civil war with the north, who wishes for Wales to soldier on independently against the south who wishes to became part of England and receive a substantially better quality of life. South wins and in 2045 the 'liquidation of Wales' act is signed. Wales ceases to be a country and is now part of western England.

It would be very unlikely if there was only one reason for every case of abuse, the point is that it was the culture that was largely to blame. Not every priest raped boys, but the culture of the priesthood made it more possible for someone with that propensity to do so.

It's a bad way to group it because ""race"" has several classifications (e.g. being British, I'm part of the British race, and being a Caucasian, I'm part of that ethnic group which makes me part of the Caucasian race, and speaking English makes me part of that race - these are *races* though, not ethnic groups).

I think /u/Thyrotoxic was trying to say that simply saying ""religion is a choice, unlike your race"" doesn't really make sense, as religion is part of your race. I think he was just checking that /u/backtowriting actually meant ""religion is a choice, unlike your ethnic group"", as that would make sense, but then phrased it as they are both equal parts of your race, and then had responses which didn't really seem to understand (""my argument is that race has nothing to do with this"", despite just having suggested that it was the fault of the religion, which is part of race, and so saying that religion is to do with this).

I think it's just that /u/backtowriting used ""race"" to mean ""ethnic group"", and then /u/Thyrotoxic was explaining that ""race"" does not mean ""ethnic group"", but can mean a variety of different things (geographical, social, linguistic, genetic, etc. affiliation).",0,1409264846,null,0,false,0,ck385k2,t3_2etl46,t1_ck385k2,t1_ck3011x,null,1427307665,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,lgf92,null,null,"You have to pay £310 in the first instance just to apply for the student visa. 

These are called Tier 4 visas, and the financial proof requirements vary depending on your circumstances. 

[The rules are very complicated, as you can see in this handy 74-page guide to the topic from UKBA](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/343718/T4_Guidance_08-14.pdf)

Firstly, you must have an unconditional, accepted offer from a UK higher education institution that is licenced to issue Tier 4 visas [(list can be found here)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/348253/Tier_4_Register_of_Sponsors_2014-08-28.pdf). You must also satisfy all of the other UK requirements for immigration, such as no criminal record, no history of financial impropriety, etc.

If you are a US citizen, you are subject to less stringent documentary requirements as per [Appendix H of the Home Office Immigration Rules](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/300949/Appendix_H.pdf). 

As per paragraph 43 of the rulebook I linked up above, basically you must show that you have sufficient funds to pay the fees for **one full year** of your course, as well as living costs for **nine months or the months during which your course lasts if less than nine**. You can deduct up to £1,020 from this requirement if you are paying your sponsor for accommodation, and they will inform you of the fee requirement when they accept you. 

Paragraph 269 of the guide says that if you intend to live in Inner London, you must show **£920** for each month of your course. Otherwise (Outer London or the rUK), you have to show **£715**.

The guide states that as you would be a ""low risk"" immigrant, you would not be required to send documentary evidence of this. However you must declare in your application that you have this evidence, as they can and do request it at will.

So to get a Tier 4 visa, you would need:

We did have a similar record for this before policing it was taken somewhat seriously.

However in the case of these Muslims gangs it is obviously because they are Muslims and not because the police  in some areas aren't enforcing the law against them.

The Catholic priesthood has problems because the law is afraid to touch the Catholic priesthood because of a history of religious discrimination. The celebrities were immune because so many were involved that when one went down they'd all come down with him, thus a network of protection that fell to pieces with the Saville allegations. These Muslims gangs are immune because of fears in some areas that any prosecution would be perceived as racist (where that comes from I don't know, I don't know of anyone who says we shouldn't pursue cases as they emerge).

In none of these cases is being a Catholic priest, a celebrity or a Muslim an indicator of anything other than police inaction. Thus we should not persecute priests, celebrities or Muslims.

true,jaywho,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"It is disingenuous to expect the changes which have come about in relatively recent years to have had an immediate knock on effect on positions tied to seniority. For example, with regards to judges: 
&gt;The judiciary of today reflects the type of person qualifying as a solicitor or barrister ten or perhaps 20 years ago, because both types of lawyer must gain a certain level of experience before applying to join the judiciary. [source](http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/judges-career-paths/diversity-gender-age-ethnicity/)

Same goes to the military, which has a fairly standard career progression for officers based upon time served (see [here](http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/27120.aspx) for a relatively typical progression). I'll grant you that private school have something of an advantage here, in that many run CCF companies from the school so there's a military element while at school. But then I think most people would (rightly) object to government sponsored cadet programs at state schools. The same goes for the house of Lords (though with the [1999 act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords_Act_1999) that's already begun to change). Give it 20 years, and if were still where we are now, I'll cede the point.

Wealth is frequently tied to land, and land tends to be a hereditary thing, so that probably explains why a lot of the rich list has a private education (historical wealth). It'd be nice if we all lived on a commune, but we don't, probably never will, so can't really change the fact that having land means having money which, in a free market, means you can spend it on getting a private education.

I'll grant you though that there's no reason for MPs or journalists to have been privately educated. But that's still better than it used to be.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"nope wrong again, try reading some race studies. Race has nothing to do with skin colour or genetics, it's a social construct. For example, the upper-classes in South America largely descendant of the colonial Europeans consider themselves white and above the non-whites who are below them in the racial hierarchy, yet when this group enters the USA's social conditions they are constructed as 'Latino's' etc., as non-whites, which is a massive shock to their consciousness and identity to - in North America - form part of an underclass to which they, in another sphere, dominated and looked down upon.

when races are constructed in societies lots of elements and notions combine in the mix that 'racialises' people into a given group and assign to them supposedly inherent characteristics. In the racialisation of the Irish by the British for example, Catholicism was an essential part of the Irish identity, part of the constructed binaries (catholic-protestant, lazy-hardworking, criminal-lawful, backwards/uncivilised-civilised, barbaric-enlightened, nonwhite-white). Now that's not to say anyone who was Catholics must be part of the Irish race, but only that Catholicism was an integral and fundamental part of the construction of what made someone 'Irish' (of course the Irish themselves had their own constructions as opposed to the colonial British). Overtime some of these constructions have decomposed when they become unviable in a given historical moment (i.e. in, as the famous book goes, making the Irish white). Hence why to be Irish was to be Catholic, just like to be Pakistani is to be muslim; despite the fact that in both cases that's doesn't, in reality, have to be the case because we aren't talking about base 'facts' but social construction embedded within our social consciousness and proliferated in a multitude of forms always in the process of contestation and affirmation.",0,1409266375,null,0,false,0,ck38w6b,t3_2etl46,t1_ck38w6b,t1_ck2z8y8,null,1427307320,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

If Chadli is our 3rd choice there, then that means we'll be missing our AML also and Lennon isn't good enough for that either.

It's a easy solution to me. Try Eriksen with Davies behind him, Holtby - Lamela. Get Townsend involved in the Schneiderlin deal and Levy Southampton, promote a Youth player and by that stage we basically have again barely any net spend and the 40 odd m we made in transfers over the last 3 seasons and put that towards a *real* AML who can fill in at AMR too.

&gt;In the same way, not every Pakistani will be a child abuser, but if you are the sort of person that might, you are more likely to give in to your own selfish wants and do it, than if you belong to another culture that demonises those sorts of acts more.

So to repeat myself again, these men came from a cultural background where it was the norm to treat women as possession that belonged to men, and where children having relationships with older men was accepted.

This is in no way a accusation that all Pakistani men are child abusers. But if you are in a Pakistani community and you said that women should do as they are told by men, you will get a much less hostile response than if you said that in wider society. Similarly, If you said in a Pakistani community that girls should be able to get married and have children at a younger age, you would get a less hostile response than if you said it anywhere else. 

This sort of environment makes it easier for a child abuser to get away with what he does. 

Again to clarify, there will always be child abusers in every section of society, but different parts of society will be more of a breeding ground for this behaviour than others.

Therefore, this deadline is specific to OP rather than an overall deadline, and has nothing to do with any election in particular.

In England and Wales, if you are not a head of household, then you will be contacted (or already have been - it's been going on since June) and you need to update your details by the deadline given. If you are the head of household then you will get a letter but you probably(1) won't need to take action. If you want, you can do it right away: https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote

In Scotland, the same change will be made but not until after the referendum next month, so no need to worry. Separately, the deadline to register to vote for the referendum is 2 September, so get a move on if you haven't registered already - https://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/electoral_registration_applica.aspx

(1) my mum didn't, but this might not be the case with every area, since each local area does things a little differently.

It's also more socialist - the pendulum inevitably swings back the other way, and in the course of 50 years an era similar to the post war consensus restores some balance to the country. There is no retirement anymore, you work till you die, but everyone works a 4 day week.

Despite these changes, more things stay the same than are different. Politicians are the same mixture of noble and corrupt. People try and cheat each other out of money, and some call it fraud while others call it sharp business practises, people quarrel about identity and fairness but ultimately get along. The grass still goes and the majority of the country remains unurbanised, although the South East is now massively built up and all the rich people have escaped to the country in the North and West.",0,1409267866,null,0,false,0,ck39lnz,t3_2eurrw,t1_ck39lnz,t3_2eurrw,null,1427306990,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I wish to refute this point.. In the report it says:

&gt;The UK Muslim Women's Network produced a report on CSE in September 2013 which drew on 35 case studies of women from across the UK who were victims, the majority of whom were Muslim.

Then goes on to say:

&gt;They were most vulnerable to men from their own communities who manipulated cultural norms to prevent them from reporting their abuse.

Also:

&gt;The Deputy Children's Commissioner’s report reached a similar conclusion to the Muslim Women's Network research, stating 'one of these myths was that only white girls are victims of sexual exploitation by Asian or Muslim males, as if these men only abuse outside of their own community, driven by hatred and contempt for white females. This belief flies in the face of evidence that shows that those who violate children are most likely to target those who are closest to them and most easily accessible.'

It also goes along to say:

&gt;The women and girls feared reporting such incidents to the Police because it would affect their future marriage prospects.


I must say I have to disagree with you to a large extent.. Islam doesn't encourage sexual exploitation. It's similar to the notion where priests sexually exploit boys. The reason for this isn't due to Christianity's teachings but because of the stupidity of the priests

Stuff like this.

&gt;Q: “But won’t we lose our EU rebate?”

&gt;A: The rebate is a sum of money paid by the EU to the entire UK, including Scotland. It’s therefore a moveable UK asset, and as such will be part of the independence negotiations like any other asset. Scotland is entitled to its share.

I guarantee France will laugh at that. 

What it doesn't say is that a currency union would cost our independence dearly - the rest of the UK (rUK) would simply not underwrite Scottish debts without cast iron guarantees on fiscal policy - taxation, benefits immigration. 

Without the currency union we could Sterlingise - however that has costs and would mean the creation of a central bank and an enormously large reserve in comparison to the size of our economy. Both to protect against oil volatility but also because a new country is vulnerable. 

To the book's credit it doesn't have the usual nationalist lies in it. The AAA credit rating. 

It does present itself as pro-independence which is fair enough too, I'd be more annoyed at it if it was to claim to be neutral. And to be even more fair coverage in the press has been fairly poor, lacked detail and focused on conflict and personality rather than facts.

If they really wanted to have a credible book they'd have actually asked questions rather than questions they want to answer.

Things like - 

&gt;Won't Europe tear up the rebate?

&gt;How many states have entered the EU without an agreement to enter the Euro in recent history?

&gt;Will we get a better settlement than we have now with the CFP?

&gt;Isn't it true that sterlingisation is not a viable long term option and the only real option in the medium to long term is the Euro?

The biggest thing it does wrong is this :

&gt;Q: “But if Scotland didn’t accept any of the UK’s national debt, wouldn’t it be punished by the international markets? Why would anyone lend Scotland money?”

&gt;A: Because it’s not Scotland’s debt. Scotland had no say over it being taken out - it’s the UK government’s debt, the UK decided where to spend it and the UK has already accepted full liability for it. If you’re living in a rented flat and the landlord defaults on his mortgage, YOU don’t get a bad credit rating.

That's just fantasy. A yes vote will not see Scotland and rUK appear in front of a judge who will determine the split of assets. Scotland will negotiate with rUK who will be looking after rUKs interests first and last. We would have a right to leave but the idea that we are in position to stand up and walk away from the debt at the same time as starting to undercut the rUK with tax and expect some share of the assets is barmy. The rUK would keep all of it's debt and iScotland would leave with a debt to the rUK - or negotiations would break down and that's far far worse for us than rUK.

As to the international money markets. They don't operate based on rules. They don't say ""Oh well Scotland didn't technically default so let's lend them fucktons of cash"". We'd have a junk rating instantly.

If you can find a 2 year old submission to a circlejerk subreddit in which I do, all very well, but I don't try to have real discussions of race issues that way.

When someone calls me a racist, I say ""pardon me? what makes you think that? what did I do?"" Then I listen to them, make an assessment of whether my behaviour was discriminatory or harmful, and deal with it.

Most people don't do that, instead crying ""no, not me! I wasn't racist! what a horrible thing to say!"" So I find the words *racist* or *racism* unconducive to actually discussing race issues.

There are lots of factors involved, the biggest one is ""Will you get caught?"" The other obvious one is ""What are you torrenting?"" Obviously you'd never download anything illegal, so for the purposes of this post we'll assume you're downloading Fedora Linux (legally) but don't want anyone to know.

/u/free_at_last is mostly right, in that it *is* about risk. But I don't think they've properly laid out the risks.

To quote [Torrentfreak](http://torrentfreak.com/the-uk-did-not-just-decriminalize-file-sharing-140723/):

&gt;VCAP is a voluntary (that’s the ‘V’ part) agreement between some rightsholders and a few ISPs to send some informational letters to people observed infringing copyright.

&gt;This means that the mainstream music labels and the major Hollywood studios will soon have an extra option to reach out to UK Internet users. However, whenever they want to – today, tomorrow or next year – any of the copyright holders involved in VCAP can still file a lawsuit or seek police action against ANYONE engaged in illegal file-sharing – FACT.

Torrenting is basically sharing, you're getting a copy and you're sharing it with others. 

If the copyright-holder of the material you are sharing decides to go after you, there's very little stopping them. Or someone else can go after you with the copyright-holder's permission. 

They can apply to a court to get a court order for the ISP to hand over your details. They can then offer you a deal if they want to, or they can sue you.

Will your ISP hand over your details without a court order? One would hope not, I'm not sure it would be legal to do so, given data protection law. 

Would your ISP hand over your details because a court ordered them to, based on an IP address? I think it's likely. Now what happens next? 

A company called Golden Eye tried it last year. They didn't take anyone to court. They sent out letters demanding £500. They likely targeted some people incorrectly. It's likely some people paid up the £500 demanded, and some people just argued and fought and Golden Eye fucked off. It could have gone differently.

If it went to court, the accused could argue that it wasn't them. That IP addresses don't identify ""individual people"", only ""internet connections"". They'd be absolutely right, but I wouldn't want to risk it.

There is a risk, and you're going to want to minimise that risk. There's *always* risk, there's also risk of being falsely accused. YMMV. But let us assume that you're torrenting something legal, like a Linux ISO, but you don't want people to know that. You've got some options.

As /u/wtt747 so elequently put it:
&gt;VPN!!!!!!!!!!!!

Using a VPN is probably the most flexible option. Basically it's an encrypted tunnel between you and your provider, and you shove all your traffic through it. When your traffic reaches your provider, it leaves the tunnel and behaves as normal. The return traffic then goes back through the VPN to you. 

Anyone (read: your ISP) that looks at your traffic *before* the VPN provider will see that there's a VPN, but they can't see what's inside it. 

Anyone who looks at the traffic *after* the VPN provider will only see the VPN provider's IP address, not yours.

Basically this means that someone looking at the ""swarm"" of the torrent won't see your IP address, only that of your VPN provider. And assuming you pick your VPN provider well, they won't have any details to hand over even if they wanted to. Because the provider doesn't keep logs. Your dirty Linux ISO downloading habit remains unpunished.

There are other options, like SOCKS proxies, and Seed Boxes etc. There are advantages and disadvantages to each.

For my Linux ISO needs, I use and recommend PrivateInternetAccess. I'm an affiliate which means that I get a small kickback if you buy with [my link](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/PODERR). Here's a non-affiliate link that is the same price, but without me getting any of it: [Non-Affiliate](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/) With the dollar where it is, it works out at about £2 a month if you buy a year.

There are plenty of other VPN providers out there. /r/vpn has lots about the subject. I've personally tried quite a few VPN providers, most recently EarthVPN, but I keep coming back to PIA. They also have a range of locations in different countries, so you can use the US or Canadian Netflix etc, or BBC iPlayer if you're out of the country. 

There are free VPN providers, but there's no fucking way in hell I'd use them or recommend them.

If you need a hand configuring stuff with PIA, even if you don't use my link, just gimme an orangered. 

If you go with another VPN provider, I can try and help (especially if it's one of the many I've used before, IPredator, HMA, Mullvad, EarthVPN etc) but because I only use PIA nowadays, you might be better off asking elsewhere.

Seriously though, Scotland will decide to stay in UK, more transfers of power to Edinburgh...this ignites a deeper discussion in England about the fact that other UK countries can vote on English issues and not vice versa.  This then results in the UK Federalising, Scotland, Wales, England and N.Ireland become federal states with the new UK, the house of lords becomes the UK senate and Westminster becomes Englands parliament.  

The UK leaves the EU, and leads the way for the southern Euro countries to leave... effectively the EU as an entity in its current forms ceases to exist, Ireland then breaks away from EU and joins the new federal UK as a sovereign state within the UK in exchange for the UK taking on its national debt and the other benefits on offer.  A stronger more confident and powerful UK finally utilises its ""special relationship"" with the USA to its advantage and convinces the USA to drop Mexico out of NAFTA and allow UK membership whilst simultaneously negotiating a free trade agreement with the diminished EU.  In addition the new UK is free to strengthen its ties with and also lead the commonwealth and signs free trade and science agreements with India and China.  The new UK is invigorated, the ingenuity of the Scots, English, Irish and Welsh united under a fair, genuinely equal, secular and democratic federal UK, backed up by the financial might of London and Edinburgh's financial sectors transforms the new UK into a top 3 world economy and we once again lead the world in science, industry and creative genius.

 But I've explained very carefully and methodically why it might be the case, I've done my research on the culture, and how it is practised in this country. I'm not being reactionary, I'm being logical, I've defended Asians when people have said they were the problem, I've defended Islam when people said that that was the problem. To me it is quite clear that one of the major factors in why these med did what they did was the Pakistani culture that they practised, and you have been unable to give any concrete reasons why I might be wrong.

 Your whole argument boils down to you are wrong because what you are saying sounds racist, and that's not good enough for me. I'm happy sticking with by opinion on the matter. 

The articles you posted are complete rubbish I'm afraid. Of course more white people are going to commit these crimes, the make up the vast majority of the population. But the articles make the same mistake you are making. ""Stuart Hall and Jimmy Savile were both white men, so there must be a problem with white people!"" NO! Their being white had nothing to do with this any more than the Rotherham case was because the men were brown. It has EVERYTING to do with the CULTURE they were surrounded by, in their case the culture within the television industry at the time that the stars could do whatever they wanted and get away with it.

-----

Fieldwork done post-debate, Tue, Wed, Thu.

I haven't seen the breakdown with Don't Knows yet, but this headline figure probably sounds more impressive than it is, as Survation were the only pollster to show a swing to No after the last debate. Their previous three polls:

 * 08/07/14:  41 Y / 46 N / 13 DK (approx. 47 Y / 53 N)
 * 01/08/14:  40 Y / 46 N / 14 DK (approx. 47 Y / 53 N)
 * 07/08/14:  37 Y / 50 N / 13 DK (approx. 43 Y/ 57 N)

Tonights results could be consistent with either of the two earlier polls. 

Given that all the other pollsters showed a move to Yes after the last debate, I'd suggest the more likely conclusion to draw is that Survation's last poll was an aberration, rather than this representing a genuine move to Yes.

However, we'll know more when the other pollsters release their next polls. 

**Edit:** Breakdown now out. It shows the highest raw figure for Yes in a Survation poll:

 * Yes 42% (+5) / No 48% (-2) /  DK 11 (-2). 

(Yes, it does add up to 101 - we'll see where the rounding is happening when the tables come out).

**Edit 2:** [Here are the tables](http://survation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Scottish-DM-2nd-Debate-Tables.pdf).

**Edit 3:** A few interesting facts: 
 
 * No is leading in the 16-24, 55-64, and 65+ age groups. Yes is leading in all others
 * Data for the 16-24 range is heavily upweighted in the sample (over double).
 * 65+ is, by far, the No campaign's stronghold (66% No). Were this group to break evenly, Yes would be leading.",0,1409270088,null,0,false,0,ck3an34,t3_2ev16u,t1_ck3an34,t3_2ev16u,null,1427306492,4,false,scottishpolitics,t5_2u66o,4

As if that stops pedestrians doing their best to fuck up cyclists on shared/split paths.

Apparently he didn't even seem to realise he'd just caused an accident, just kept winding his way along the path.

Even if my bike wasn't fucked at the moment, I'd be leery of riding it. Road drivers act like you don't exist, in the best case, or actively try to kill you in the worst. Things like deliberately speeding up when they see you passing the side road they're on, to try and hit you on the junction, or moving closer to the pavement as they pass to try and knock you off.

Pedestrians, on the other hand, try and make you hit them. They step in front of you, they charge at you, they do their level best to drive you off the pavement and onto the road, even if said pavement is a marked cycle path. Mothers with buggies happily act like a cycle path is for their use alone. I've had someone on a pavement step in front of me, so close I could barely avoid him, and look *disappointed* that I didn't fall off.

Yes, there are cyclists that are complete and utter dicks.

My point is that when it's white men, or christian white men. It's never talked about that culture. It's TV culture. It's power dynamics. It's not in the news that this is a right wing problem, in that far right groups there's quite a high percentage of men in prison for child abuse and rape. Or that it's a left wing problem, in that the SWP essentially fell apart through covering up the rapes of vulnerable women. Or teacher culture, where white christian men are told ""not to get too close"" but still manage to run away with underage girls.

Why is it never talked about that IT'S JUST SOCIETY. It's not white, or brown, or muslim, or christian, or pakistani, or british. It's frigging worldwide. British culture is fucked on this.

As a driver, I've seen morons go the wrong way around a large roundabout to take a shortcut to the last exit, granted traffic was fairly light, but it only takes one car that they can't see coming around the roundabout to put themselves in real danger.

As a cyclist, I've seen cyclists go straight past me, through a red light at a crossing, without even slowing down, forcing a car going through a green light to swerve in order to avoid hitting them, and they just carried on cycling.

I know the really dangerous cyclists are in the minority, but they're still creating extremely dangerous situations that send a driver's heart into their throat, forcing them to make potentially dangerous manoeuvres to avoid.

Now, they really got it together in the second half and improved dramatically, and I don't want to take anything away from them. Paulinho, in particular, I thought grew into the game and was terrific at points. Nor should we underestimate Limassol. I thought they were fairly well-organized again, they pressed, and they played hard.

All the same, this was clearly our ""second"" team. I thought Sandro and Demebele struggled to move the ball out from the back at times, they were susceptible to pressure, and they were downright sloppy at times.

Arguably his best game for us was against Stoke, right up until the point where he got Charlie Adamed.  From memory, he was playing in one of his most advanced roles he's had with us, and he did well because he was freed from defensive responsibilities, could press from the front, and could roam all over the pitch and do what he wanted.

I think if he has a future here, it would most likely be in the bank of three behind a striker.  Line him up with Eriksen and Lamela (or Holtby/Townsend if part of a B-team) in a role similar to what Chadli had against QPR.  Chadli was allowed to move horizontally across the pitch, and got into the box for crosses.  Paulinho has decent heading ability and is more physical than a lot of our other players, so could really throw himself about in that kind of situation.

No it hasn't you dumbass. White men commit 78% of all child sex abuse offenses, the reason Muslim men predominate in some areas of the country is because THERE ARE LOTS OF MUSLIM MEN in those areas and also LOTS OF VULNERABLE WHITE GIRLS. However, the race thing is a huge red herring because in areas where white people predominate, WHITE GUYS are the ones committing the vast majority of child sex abuse. The race thing is not an inconvenient truth, it's entirely irrelevant. Men of all races need to have their attitudes towards women examined, and child protection services need to be better resourced and better prepared to protect vulnerable children. These are the root causes of this rash of child abuse, the race of the perpetrator is irrelevant because it's the lack of protection for the vulnerable that allows this to happen in the first place.

To be fair, when I started to get interested in football, I googlemapped where I was born (in Northumberland, while my folks were working in the UK) and figured out where the closest team was.  I was sold as soon as I saw they were rivals of Arsenal's because at that point the only people I knew were super-cunty arsenal fans, and I just needed an exuse, yanno?  

I also asked a guy in an arsenal jersey the other week who his favorite player was (his kit was blank) and he said Ozil.  Fair enough, but when he asked me who my favorite team was and I said ""spurs"", he said ""no, soccer not basketball dumbass"" and I laughed and walked off.

Once again, this is because whites are the majority of the country.

Do you understand what disproportionate means? Sure there were more of them, but they also committed MORE THAN THEIR POPULATION PERCENTAGE OF THE CRIMES

Let me give you an example, since you find it hard to understand

10% asian population = 10% of sexual abuse cases, to be expected, it's proportional

10% asian population = 40% of sexual abuse cases? Not proportional, clearly something else is at play.

A couple of things.

1) Why are you so intolerant?

What would you like to know specifically? If you could tell us what subjects you're interested in that would be very helpful, as every uni has different strengths and weaknesses.

Off the top of my head I can think of a few things:

1. British unis are quite diverse and have varying levels of prestige. It's worth being educated on what's what so you can apply to an effective variety of unis. [This tvtropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishUnis) gives a very brief and somewhat incomplete overview of both the education system and the loose pecking order that our unis are in. Don't get too bogged down in how prestigious your uni is according to others, though: if you like it and you like the course, that's enough.

2. EU students are eligiable for the tuition fee loan, which is paid straight from the government to your university. However, they are not eligiable for a maintenance loan (which covers living costs) so you'll need to figure out how to fund that yourself. 

3. We have quite an extensive university ranking system. [Here's one](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings), but there are others. Don't treat the rankings as gospel, but do use that as a rough guide to check that students like the course you want to do and graduates are actually getting employed. 

4. Universities tend to give offers based on our A levels or UCAS tariff points, so you'll need to find a conversion of your qualifications to either of those. However, something I'd noticed with helping my EU friend is that different unis are giving different conversions, which can obviously either help or hinder you since your grades might be worth more or less in different places. If you have any questions, contact the uni directly and explain the situation after looking up what that uni uses as a grade conversion chart.

That comment is a glaring example to show other people when you accuse them of racism - it shows that you're not to be taken seriously on the subject.

Particularly so when we take into account the parent comments - in which you accuse a youth charity food drive for the poor of ""having an agenda"" and [this other comment in which you talk about segregation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2enj6o/a_bunch_of_subs_cosign_a_letter_stating_that/ck1he2g)

Like I said, I would love to see us ''do a Levy'' with Saints interest in Townsend. Bring Schneiderlin in, which paves the way for *potentially* another CM (or even 2) to leave. Put that money towards a real versatile, quality attacking AML and promote an academy player. 

Like you said, when you think about it we have zero class wingers. I mean depth wise perhaps, but I don't consider Lennon or Townsend anything more than good squad/backup players right now. Chadli i'm gaining faith in, and I hope he has a monster season alongside Eriksen and Lamela. 

But...I still feel like we need to bring in a top class AML though to complement them 2 and dare I say it we must have a little bit of cash to put towards one if needs be. I know Levy has one eye on the Stadium, but we've made 40+m the past few windows and I can't see the Townsend/Schneiderlin deal costing us more than 5-10m (if that happens - with them making more noises about him and our obvious interest in Morgan and him wanting to go I can see it happening). Add the ridiculous TV money to that this year that everyone is throwing around - I feel like we need too.

Exactly. Why aren't I to be taken seriously?

No strolls. They're not disgusting and hateful. You're just confused.

And yes on that /r/blackladies comment, segregating yourself by race and gender is not healthy.

Please don't get upset. I'm just wondering why you're following me posting the same comment over and over. You'll notice at first I didn't respond. But keep doing it and it's weird.

EDIT: Here's the reply you deleted

    Why aren't I to be taken seriously?

This is apparently something that most other people can see, and you can't.

Like I say, I wish I could find words that you'd accept. I don't know what they are.

    And yes on that /r/blackladies comment, segregating yourself by race and gender is not healthy.

So what are minorities supposed to do? When they're in the local paper, you accuse them of having an agenda, when they segregate themselves you say it's not healthy.

There appears nothing they can do which is acceptable to you.

Right Strolls. You just sound like a confused nutcase. I'm sure you and your internet friends all think I'm an awful person. Good for them.

The comments you linked.

1. Calling white people native to Britain is not hateful or racist. It's fact. In the same way white people in America or south Africa are not native. Read the context on that post. I said ""No one would care if they were native children"". The op posting obviously had a racially motivated agenda. Many people in there agree. Could I be wrong? Maybe yes. Am I racist? No.

2. Yes segregating yourself by race and gender is not progressive. It's a step backwards. Hence my ""It feels like the 50s"" comment.",0,1409276886,null,0,1409278225,0,ck3duf7,t3_2etl46,t1_ck3duf7,t1_ck3ds5o,null,1427304998,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I made the slog through the bulk of the series straight up start to finish (excepting those that aren't there, of course), and it was absolutely worthwhile to me.  Given that, I can easily say that it might not be for you.  The times when it elevates beyond quirky old sci-fi, and hits legitimately good television are exceptional, but it's 26 years of TV.  The cast and crew and design and story philosophy didn't just change in that time, they changed over and over and over.  And in the course of that time, nobody's going to make a good watch every time.  It just can't happen.  The sheer difficulty of trying to familiarize yourself with so much pure content can be a real slog.

That said, if you're into doing this, I suggest you start with the third doctor.  Watch Spearhead From Space.  If I remember correctly it's on netflix.  If you're not into that, skip to the fourth doctor.  Not his first story, really--try to skip to the fourth one, Genesis of the Daleks.  It's one of the all time classics.  If you're into that, the fourth doctor might be your taste.  From there, you'll have a better perspective on where you want to go.  The second doctor, for example, is a very comedic, fun character, with a lot of good stories.  Unfortunately most of them were destroyed in the sixties.  The fifth doctor has some good content, and he's a very obviously heroic sort of character, which I really enjoyed.  The sixth and seventh were both plagued by questionable decisions, hostile management, and abrupt cuts to their runs, but there is definitely some fun there to be had.

This is apparently something that most other people can see, and you can't.

Like I say, I wish I could find words that you'd accept. I don't know what they are.

Personally, the people I take seriously about race issues are those who talk about how race issues affect other people, too. Who can talk about race issues dispassionately (i.e. with statistics and studies and stuff), and who don't talk about race issues only to paint themselves as the victim.

You're not looking at race issues with consideration - you're not looking at the other side of things, only how you perceive them to affect you. You're not talking about how it feels to be stopped and searched by the police regularly, or to be followed around by store security guards, to be denied a flat or a house, just because of the colour of your skin.

I don't think you really want to solve race issues, only to complain about some of them.

All it seems to be about, with you, is disgust and outrage about the way other people - who happen to be a different colour from you - happen to live their lives. This is hugely offensive to you, and you *have* to have an opinion on it.

I'm sure there is a misogyny problem amongst British Pakistani &amp;/or muslim men, but I want to discuss that with people who habitually talk about race problems, not with people who only talk about race problems when it suits them.

I'm pretty sure that any other week of the year you'd be saying that ""rape culture isn't a real thing"", denying it and saying that rape culture is just a feminist invention. Yet here you are, this week, all of a sudden wanting to share your opinions on the subject. You're welcome to do that, but I ain't interested in them - not this week.

&gt; And yes on that /r/blackladies comment, segregating yourself by race and gender is not healthy.

So what are minorities supposed to do? When they're in the local paper, you accuse them of having an agenda, when they segregate themselves you say it's not healthy.

There's a difference between criticising a religion and blanket-bashing millions of people. There are tons of muslim people that are genuinely great people but they aren't following Islam strictly. Those that do are sexist and preach the same teachings as the Islamic State. There are literally over 100 verses that teach why it is ok to go to war in the cause of Islam.

I'm not against bashing any religion that deserves it, doesn't mean I'm speaking down on the people.

I think people would get the impression of a silly show. One of the things that turned me off about earlier seasons were all the corny CGI monsters.

The thing that hooks the show (or did for me) is when you grow to love the characters. I remember watching an Amy/Rory episode as a one-off before I watched the series front to back. The first time she made no impression, the second time watching in sequence I thought, ""Oh, that's so Amy."" I wish I could pinpoint where exactly that happened, but I can't.

I agree with Entertainment Weekly that ""The Eleventh Hour"" is the best place to start. You don't need to know anything, it's a starting point, and it's a good episode. Get people over to watch that and the next couple (Skip ""Victory of the Daleks"") and you've got a good shot.

Other good hook episodes IMO include: 'Blink', 'Girl in the Fireplace', 'Dalek', 'Empty Child'/'Doctor Dances', 'Human Nature'/'Family of Blood', 'Midnight'.",0,1409281168,null,0,false,0,ck3fszr,t3_2etq56,t1_ck3fszr,t3_2etq56,null,1427304083,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

My point really is that weather is that weather is pretty much the ultimate boring subject to talk about: non-political, out of human hands, something that's inevitable and can't really be controlled or changed (and yes, I know I'm disregarding climate change, but bear with me).

There are so many other things in the news that a newspaper could potentially be covering: whether it's domestic or international politics, wars that are going on, criminal cases and injustices, and so on. That's really the power of good journalism: it allows us to learn about the wider world beyond our own small sphere of influence. It connects us with the rest of humanity by telling us what is happening in the world.

The Express by contrast, and even more so than the Mail, seems like it tries to do the opposite: keep people in their own small little worlds, focus on things that affect them and don't worry about what else is going on. Weather is a perfect example: it's something that affects you, there's nobody to blame for it and nothing you can do to change it. Just looking at [the recent front pages](http://www.thepaperboy.com/uk/daily-express/front-pages-today.cfm) gives some more examples:

* ""JIHADIST KILLERS ON OUR STREETS"": They're coming to get us, the ""different"" brown people who we don't understand. Oh no!
* ""HOUSE PRICES UP BY £23,000"": How will our kids be able to buy their first home now?
* ""HOW TO RECLAIM UNPAID PENSION"": Self explanatory and fits the demographic /u/_njd_ described to a 'T'.
* ""HOSPITAL CAR PARK RIP-OFF MUST END"": I mean really, do I need to say anything?
