* Injury - The guy is tiny, amazingly fast, frustrating for defenders and young. One bad smack in one random game (say Villa) with a has-been defender furious of this new upshot and whops, he may never be the same again. (Torres with knee for Chelsea)

* Inconsistency/failure to live up to the hype - Explains itself, can happen to anyone, and pressure, money, fame and responsibility can take it's toll on a 19 year old mind. Just look at American teen models.

* Transfers - If he does avoid injury, and do manage to perform at his high level consistently for a whole year, he might get tempted by the higher powers that be (if there are any). My worst fear is seeing him in a United jersey, grinning and scoring. It keeps me up at nights.

Definition

Under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997:

""A person must not pursue a course of conduct

    ""(a) which amounts to harassment of another, and
    ""(b) which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other.""[1]

Harassment also occurs when, on the grounds of race, disability, sex, sexual orientation, belief or religion, an employer - or their agent such as another employee or a manager - engages in unwanted conduct which has the purpose or effect of violating an individual's dignity or creating an interrogating, degrading, hostile offensive or humiliating environment for the employee in question. This is wide spectrum, and covers all types of harassment.

Such actions can be:

    Physical conduct;
    Verbal conduct; and
    Non-verbal conduct.

In addition, while the conduct must be unwanted by the recipient, it does not necessarily have to be that the harasser has a motive or an intention to harass. So it is still harassment even if the harasser does not know there is harm caused by their actions.",0,1398984159,null,0,false,0,ch798gd,t3_24fhr2,t1_ch798gd,t1_ch6sbg1,null,1433611156,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

getting your first passport is not covered at all.  This leads me to believe that renew a standard adult covers your situation of getting the first passport.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"First off - for anyone of Clarkson's generation, it was the *standard* version of the rhyme.  The original version has the N-word, which was then altered in the 70s or 80s to suit contemporary mores. 

Secondly - it's really hard to explain humor, especially of the controversial kind.  I can't tell you for sure what the intent was, because I didn't write the scene, but I assume that it was playing off the taboo nature of the rhyme somehow.  Perhaps it went like this:

Clarkson starts telling the rhyme, realizes that the second line is now considered offensive and so has to mumble the line - the point being that we as an audience are privy to the discomfort, because we understand it's wrong to say those words.  

Taboo words make us uneasy and that uneasiness can be very funny, which is why lots of comedy intentionally deals with skirting taboos.  It doesn't mean that the teller is endorsing the subject of the joke!  A comedian might tell a joke about having sex with a donkey, but that doesn't mean he's endorsing bestiality!

Thirdly:  Clarkson apparently realized that the scene didn't work and requested a different take be used - the 'teacher take'.  That to me *completely* exonerates him.  You can't blame performers for material they've rejected!  Imagine witch hunting a writer for writing a page of a novel which she later threw in the bin because it didn't work and might have upset people.  It's ludicrous!

Yes many didn't get sentenced when they should have been and others received lesser charges and some served shockingly short sentences such as Ian Thain, the first soldier to have served a prison sentence  for murder in the troubles who served only 22 months and was then reinstated into the army. (This was stupid, murder is murder and the full sentence should have been served and he should have been treated as any other murderer, but I don't know if it was appealed or what happened). Shit like that made the army look worse than it was and breeds bad feelings for generations, rightfully so.

However, saying NO soldiers ever served time is deceitful. The army fucked up enough that it doesn't need lies to make it sound worse. Its easily proven false and undermines your argument.

Ill openly admit that I'm a unionist, I will admit there were scumbags in the security forces, I will admit that many of the actions the forces carried out were incredibly stupid and counterproductive and some were definitely illegal, cover ups happened, people were protected who shouldn't have been, loyalist paramilitaries were almost entirely mindless thugs and there was often severe abuses against Catholics.

It seems like Rodgers takes a lot of pride in player development and considers it one of the central parts of his job. We might get one or two 'proven' or 'big name' players over the summer and a couple more youngsters/bargains, but i don't see us getting more than that unless we sell a good number of players. I know he's been after a winger or a midfielder that can score for a while, so that should be one of the spots. 

We should be integrating Suso, Ilori and Borini back into the squad, as well as possibly other youngsters (Alberto for one. Wisdom? Texiera? Ibe?) So we could have a deep squad without going crazy in the transfer market. This could be good for us because Rodgers values squad chemistry as well, so you don't want to introduce too many random people if you can avoid it. 

Plus, I know everyone wants to be strong for the Champions league and the other competitions, but remember how BR always says that we're a work in progress and not the finished article? Some weaknesses in our team do need to be addressed by getting new players, but some things will change just as he introduces new tactics and roles for the players.

Also I don't want a society where people gain their satisfaction through drugs. I want a society of people that gain satisfaction through hard work and are rewarded for their effort in improving society.

I reckon alcohol is okay, but I drink that sometimes several times a week and have done for years and am not addicted, but if people started doing something similar to heroin, I think society could potentially be in real trouble and it'd be too many years into it to realise the extent.

There is a chilling post in /r/bestof somewhere where a user recounts their experiences with heroin and how it doesn't look addictive but the addiction creeps up and many users related to it. It is a pretty chilling post and something anyone should read before committing to one side or another.

Ramires on the other hand *always* has the ball, as that's his role. But his passing is dire sometimes. Imagine if it was Oscar who always had the ball?

Does he really think that landlords and letting agents will suddenly start wanting to make less money? If they're being locked into longer 3yr contracts without the flexibility to evict tenants (but the fear of tenants leaving after only 6 months), they're going to put prices up. And if the letting agencies can't change fees, they'll take larger percentages of the rent, so the landlord will put the prices up again. One way or another, the tenant is going to pay for it. Landlords and companies aren't suddenly going to start earning less.

&gt;During this period, landlords could only ask tenants to leave for a breach of contract, or if they wanted to sell the property or needed it for their own use, not as a way of raising the rent.

&gt;The problem is there aren't any long term studies

Yes there are. Portugal decriminalised drugs about 12 years ago.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_Portugal
Same with Spain, Italy and Holland.


&gt;Stuff like binge drinking doesn't exist in other countries

It most certainly does.

&gt;Also I don't want a society where people gain their satisfaction through drugs.

This shows a misunderstanding of the nature of addiction. Addicts aren't getting satisfaction, they're taking heroin to feel normal. People become addicted for various reasons whether it be abuse, depression, grief, escapism, poverty etc. The way you put it suggests these people are having fun- they are victims.

&gt;I want a society of people that gain satisfaction through hard work and are rewarded for their effort in improving society.

Well this is my entire point- these people need treatment and help to become active members of society. It costs less money to treat addiction than it does to be prosecuting addicts for possession or for desperate crimes or violent behaviour. Free of addiction, they can contribute. I'm not entirely sure what point you meant to make with that statement.

&gt;I reckon alcohol is okay, but I drink that sometimes several times a week and have done for years and am not addicted, but if people started doing something similar to heroin, I think society could potentially be in real trouble and it'd be too many years into it to realise the extent.

You seem to think that decriminalisation would mean Amsterdam style heroin shops. I'm talking about certified clinics where people addicted to the drug can be referred to by a doctor to receive pure, clean doses (with clean needles) as well as counselling to help manage and break addiction.
And while I appreciate the links to personal stories they don't really address the issue of whether decriminalisation would help society as a whole. You've also got to look at the reasons why addiction come about- unemployment, poverty, mental illness, abuse. These can all be treated by a more compassionate drug policy (and ideally, a more compassionate welfare/wage policy).",0,1398990298,null,0,1399025976,0,ch7btpl,t3_24fwd6,t1_ch7btpl,t1_ch7b1no,null,1433612376,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's not uncommon for both recreational and medicinal users to use something called APAP extraction which separates the codeine from the paracetamol. Of course, if you get it wrong, you have the potential of a very painful death.

Alcohol is a drug. It's an *incredibly* potent drug at that -- one of only two that can physically kill you on a withdrawal, and only of only few that I can think of that injure almost every major organ. Not that I'm saying heroin, or cocaine, or almost any other currently illegal drug should be *legalized* for recreational use (apart from CBD dominant cannabis). But if we're going to be improving society and basing drugs on an evidence based policy, then alcohol must be put in the same category of drugs that pose a similar danger.

The solution to this has already been proposed by David Nutt -- people would still be able to get drunk, but without the risks that are caused by ethanol. He even developed an anti-dote that would instantly make you sober.

true,collect_my_data,EN,england,"Hold on a minute.

Sorry to keep you waiting on this. 

Ramires does the work of both a dedicated DM and a box to box midfielder in every match, people on here always call him a limited player but in his time at Chelsea he has played pretty much every position in the centre of midfield and the right flank. You already appreciate his work rate but I don't think you understand just how important that is for Mourinho from his CM's. In the Atletico match he consistently found space because he's so hard to man-mark, he did that whilst shutting down space for the Atletico players and pretty much man-marking Arda Turan (an absolutely fantastic player) out of the game in the first half, until Mourinho brought on Eto' and opened the game up. 

You criticise his technical ability, things like his passing, but over the season his pass completion stats are [0.01% worse than Matic's](http://www.thechels.co.uk/). If you have a further look at those stats you'll also see that Ramires is 3rd in the '% of teams completed' category. What that table shows is that over 8% of our teams passes this season have been completed by Ramires (not bad, no?) and this is where I think the issue with this sub and Ramires comes up. He does soooo much more for us in a game than any other player. Like I said at the start, he does the jobs of 2 to 3 players a match, he's irrepressible. Because he does so much, it's inevitable he'll make more mistakes, and people latch on to this, and then confirmation bias happens. 

Admitted his first touch isn't fantastic (it's not as bad as the hyperbole around here will have you believe), but there isn't a player in the world who will offer what Ramires can offer, whilst also having a world class first touch, except maybe Modric, but Tottenham didn't sell him to us, the cunts. Also remember that because of his role, Ramires will likely take more touches than most of our players, so he will make more mistakes. 

He does a role that football fans generally don't appreciate, but he does it fantastically 9 games out of 10. There's a reason both Ancelloti and Mourinho (the two finest managers of their generation) talk very highly about him, if you could grow a player in a test tube for Mourinho, Ramires would be that player, he is pretty much the archetypal Mourinho midfielder. I can remember reading quotes from players who have played against him about how he is so tough on and off the ball, so hard to deal with. 

And I am sorry if I acted like a dick in the first comment, I just get really, really exasperated with the constant, never ending Ramires criticism on this sub, I've already made a monster post before about how he is underappreciated around here. He's a player who, if you watch a match for a second time and only focus on him, what he does, where he positions himself and how the opposition are forced to react to him, you find it hard to say he's a limited player, as is oft repeated around here.

Basically every question is designed to make you look you can do more than you can. Don't be embarrassed or fooled into stating anything else. Because they'll take your money like they did to my dad, and he doesn't have the strength to challenge them. So he almost lost the house.

She refused assistance and said it was normal. When I asked my manager about this I was told that this was the policy, and it was a disciplinary issue if I broke the policy. 

So in the event of a fire it really comes down to how well policy is enforced, and the ability of the staff to go ""fuck the policy"". During a fire drill I can kinda see the point as making someone on crutches walk down 7 flights of stairs is going to screw their day, and carrying them could hurt either the person being carried or the person doing the carrying. But during a real fire, I would take the that risk.

Regardless, they're referring to the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights) which strangely enough isn't an EU creation (its the Council of Europe's). I assume the joke is that because one such right is to private life(art 8), and to property( art 1 of protocol 1) then they make the assumption that an illegal immigrant cannot be deported if he has a cat that he'd be separated from. From a legal point of view, that's nonsense. It's the exact kind of hyperbole and scare-mongering which, sadly, might get the UKIP elected in the MEP elections.

But the joke's on them. They're a one-trick pony. If you look at the comic book -sorry, leaflet- you won't find a single policy except 'get out the EU'. Great! If we do end up out of the EU (the Tories might do it if UKIP don't) by the hands of UKIP, then the MEP seats will disappear as we wont be there. Then UKIP can fade back into the background.

His ball control is horrible, he loses possession easily too, and has messed up plays (as Schurrle was keen to call him out on on Sunday).

Eto'o is just old, and way past his prime. He was great at Inter but that was years ago, but he works hard and has given us crucial wins.

Torres has been our striker in the big games, and I feel he has stepped up in those games. He is frustrating against the lower teams, but despite having the least goals of the 3, he *has* gotten us important points or lifelines in both the PL and CL.

true,SatansBawsack,null,null,"Whilst you are correct about the legal requirement, I'm not sure I appreciate the anti-Scottish sentiment. I apologise if it was not meant, but that is how it reads (use of 'their' and the condescending 'fancy paper'). You say properly backed money, but it is all a bit ridiculous because it is all properly backed in a way.

Scotland has always had its legal differences. It's part of the reason Scotland is Scotland and was not absorbed into England in 1707. Now, for some petty reason, justified by some lawmaker (who may be Scottish or English), Scottish notes are not 'legal tender' in Scotland or England. However, each note is a bill of exchange/promissory note ('I promise to pay the bearer on demand..'). So I could go into the Clydesdale Bank offices in Edinburgh (where i believe they are) and request my £5/10/20 in sterling. I could then take this to a bank in England and exchange that for an English note.  I have now made my money acceptable in England and it hasn't changed in substance. Its just a different face and name on the front. It's not done, but it could be. What's the difference? Purely the note.

For some reason, someone decided our gold wasn't as good as the English gold (or some equivalent reason) and that we would not honour our promissory notes if an English person turned up. That's ridiculous. No matter who you are, if you turn up at the bank's offices with that note and ask for your sterling, you'd get it. Same as in England. So, you see, its ridiculous that anyone would get on their high horse and not accept each others notes when they are the same currency, same exchange rate, same value and it irrelevant to both systems who you are when you present it. Wouldn't it be easier if both systems accepted each others notes, knowing the money is recoverable from the other country anyway?

If I was to pay an Englishman £100 in Scottish notes, he'd have no trouble getting that money, and if an Englishman gave me £100 in English notes, I'd have no trouble getting that from the Bank of England. 

I hope this doesn't read as Anti-English in any way. I don't intend it to. In my opinion, both notes should be accepted in each country as they are worth the same. I can't think of a justifiable reason why they shouldn't be (I'm aware of the bailout but the distinction arose before then). Both economies can back their own currency.

true,this_guy_says,lfc92,,"&gt; All this to say I'm a bit dismayed at how quickly some on this sub have turned on him and would be happy to see him out the door. I, for one, believe he has a significant future at this club, even if it's something of a diminished role (cup games, lesser opposition, when Cap'n Stevie may need rest or has picked up a knock).

&gt; Lest we forget, folks! Lucas is the strong-but-silent type who has given his (significant) all to this club and has nothing but love, respect and admiration for LFC, its fans and the city as a whole. **I hope one day he gets the recognition he deserves** and is regarded as one of the few shining lights in a dark period (I'm looking at you Gillett/Hicks).

&gt; And that is all I have to say about that.

---

First off, this isn't an unpopular opinion, so please don't make it sound like one.

I'll be the first guy to criticize Lucas' role here compared to how the majority overrate him. I don't think he sucks by any means, he can be quite effective, but he hasn't shown that as much in his opportunities this year.

That said, I've *always* said I respect the shit out of him and I'm sure every other actual LFC supporter does too, and it's exactly because of his personality and character.

Shaw is a great fullback, but I don't know that he would be great for *us*. His style of play, while impressive, just doesn't suit Rodgers style.

I actually thought Johnson played pretty well against Chelsea, and I disagree with OP's suggestion that the fullbacks were the key in that match. It seems like a hindsight, too easy observation for me.

I do, however, agree with his assessments of Montoya and De Sciglio. I'd be more than happy with either player.

**In** 

* A striker: Diego Costa: Many people are not fans of his attitude. But he is a workhorse and certainly has the physique to play in the EPL. My only concern is that he has only had one great year

* A central midfielder: Ivan Rakitic: Has been superb yet again for Sevilla this season. An immense passer and also has a good shot. Would be a great partner to Matic.

* A left back: Luke Shaw: An 18-year old on the team of the season. Even though many, including myself, feel that Dave deserved it more, you can't ignore the sheer potential in Shaw. 


**Out**

* Torres: I know he has been good lately and he is a nice guy, but at some point that just doesn't cut it anymore. In bad times, his bad attitude can affect the whole team and his massive wages are not worth it. A cash+Torres deal for Costa would be my preferred scenario.

* Marin: Can't see him taking the spot from any of our current wingers. Use him to sweeten a deal for Rakitic.

* Moses: Same as Marin, not better than our current options. 

* Mikel: Doesn't really bring anything new to the table. I'd rather see Chalobah getting some chances as backup DM.

* Eto'o: I personally wouldn't re-sign him. 

* Gaël Kakuta: Don't think he'll ever pan out the way we wanted him to. 


**Back from loans**

* Courtois: We all saw it. He is a brilliant goalkeeper. We can't afford to lose him.

* Lukaku: With him and a player with more experience, our striker force should be set. 

* Thorgan Hazard: I've really taken a liking to this guy. He may not be ready next season, but he should get some time in pre-season. Where he plays next season should be judged by his performances. He would be a nice player to keep Oscar focused on earning his spot as no. 10. 

* Lucas Piazon: Same as Thorgan.

* Kurt Zouma: Can't decide if a loan to a small PL club or a year under JT and Cahill's tutelage would benefit him more.

Sturridge and Suarez have only started roughly half our games this season together, the other half it's been largely one or the other playing as a solitary striker, so we don't really need/have to have 2 on the pitch, the formation just changes a bit.

Don't throw stats at it, they really don't tell the whole story.  It is pretty obvious to most that since his bad injuries, he just hasn't been the same.

That's not to say he is a bad player and i'm sure he has a role to play next season with our increased number of games.

He has a wonderful attitude for the club and that, much like Agger,  buys him much love from our fans. 

I honestly think he is a bit overrated by some, as has been seen by his lack of games since the formation change to SG at the pivot of midfield.

If Lucas was absolutely outstanding, with our thin squad, I think BR would be finding a way to get him on the pitch rather than dropping him to the bench.

I got into baseball analytics in the early 00s, did it as a bit of a 2nd job for a bit, couple friends wound up getting jobs with MLB clubs and still do it. 

Important to remember football analysis is still very much in it's infancy Perhaps even more so then baseball back in the early 00s. Back then we got plenty of stuff wrong, We misinterpreted data, overvalued something, ignored others ect... However even back then it improved understanding of the game and player value a ton compared to just years before. I think Football stats today is like that, your advancing it even when you don't get everything right.

I wish I had opta, there's quite a bit of stuff that reminds me of things we got wrong in early baseball analytics in football right now. I don't really have the time or resources to do the analysis to see if I am correct.

No cares except us. If BR goes and spends 30 million on a great attacking player this summer are all these people going to to be on here saying, 'this is terrible, I didn't want the club to go in this direction.'

Heads up.... the answer is no.

We spent 16million last summer on Sahko. Hardly a dirt cheap bit of business. He will have to turn into one of best CB in Europe for us to ever see an increase in his value.

We overpent on Allen and Borini. Almost 30 milion? We have seen improvement in Allen but not to the tune of 15 million. ( Borini may prove to be worth the investment )

Everyone points to Coutihno and Sturridge but outside of them we have payed alot of money for the players we have, given what we could recoup for them if sold.

People far too often confuse ""Economics"" with ""Politicians Economic Policy"", our country's economic policies are not set by economists its set by politicians.

Also this is massively misleading,

&gt;During that time, Japan's per capita GDP grew at 1% per year. This means that in 2000, Japan's per capita GDP was 10.5% higher than in 1990. In the UK, per capita GDP at the end of 2013 was 6.6% lower than that in 2007. This means that, unless the UK economy miraculously grows at around 5% a year for the next four years (factoring in population growth rate of around 0.7% a year), it is going to have a decade that is even more ""lost"" than Japan's 1990s.

Comparing an average through a recession where the economy was growing much faster at either end with 10 years of very very slow growth and rising government debt in Japan and therefore saying we're in a worse place is just wrong.

&gt;How has this mess been created? The mismanagement of the crisis by the coalition government means it has to bear significant blame, but the main cause lies in the nature of the economic model that the UK has pursued for three decades.

&gt;This model started, as is well known, with Margaret Thatcher. She ripped up the post-second world war consensus on the mixed economy and started establishing one of the most deregulated economies in the rich world.

This of course ignores the fact that the entire rich world was hit by the economic crash, regardless of how regulated their economy was.

&gt;Contrary to what professional economists will typically tell you, economics is not a science. All economic theories have underlying political and ethical assumptions, which make it impossible to prove them right or wrong in the way we can with theories in physics or chemistry. This is why there are a dozen or so schools in economics, with their respective strengths and weaknesses, with three varieties for free-market economics alone – classical, neoclassical, and the Austrian.

&gt;Given this, it is entirely possible for people who are not professional economists to have sound judgments on economic issues, based on some knowledge of key economic theories and appreciation of the political and ethical assumptions underlying various theories. Very often, the judgments by ordinary citizens may be better than those by professional economists, being more rooted in reality and less narrowly focused.

true,kopking08,null,null,"Dude, Lucas is one of the most highly regarded Liverpool players for a lot of reasons. One is because he became one of the best DMs in the world for a time for us. Two is because he had a rough start and took a lot of criticism, but came through to be a hugely important player for us. Three is because he's a great guy and a pillar of fortitude at the club.

What's happening right now is simply that he's been sacrificed for a bigger legend. Before Lucas' injury, it looked more likely that Gerrard should be dropped to the bench this season. Then Rodgers changed things up to accommodate Gerrard and it turned out to be a masterstroke.

Right now I'd expect Lucas and Gerrard to basically rotate at DM next season. Lucas is, unfortunately, not going to be able to play at the same time as Gerrard unless we bring in another workhorse like Hendo.

I think there are a lot of lineup combos that could come about depending on who we sign. Lucas has certainly not lost his opportunity to be a massively important person at Liverpool. As far as pure DMs, there are few who have shown themselves better value for money.

My expectation is that we're likely to look for a CM who can add steel to our midfield but still do work going forward. It might mean Lucas plays less, but it'll be comparatively less. Don't forget this summer is the World Cup. Gerrard, after this season and the coming Cup, will likely be exhausted next year.


And also remember that people momentarily saying someone is not on the top of their game is not tantamount to them saying he should be sold.

The discussion around the debt should hopefully satisfy people. It's still a reckless amount of money to have lost but it it *sounds* like there's no imminent danger and the relevant business plans are in place no matter where the club is next season. There's obviously definite antipathy towards FFP under the current circumstances, so the rumours of lawyers ready in the trenches might have some truth to them.

For all the vitriol I've seen against Beard from some quarters, I think he's ok. Mark Connolly is obviously his man from the O2 days. I thought he was the spikiest personality up there but when asked about his credentials by LFW he should have silenced any doubters - as well as the O2 centre he's worked on St. George's Park. It's almost lucky we got him instead of Clint on the panel, otherwise we might have missed that.

Notable for a lack of any discussion around Harry, beyond TF's assertion that he can't play youngsters himself as he isn't the manager.

It's the backing that turns it from just paper (indeed, with lots of anti-copy protection stuff in (hence the fancy)) into legal currency and therefore something with inherent value. It wasn't to call your notes ""fancy paper"".

Whilst I agree that Scottish gold isn't any different to English gold, I imagine it was done this way to manage the amount of money in the system (IE inflation). This would be even more important now that we're not on the gold standard.

&gt; Now, for some petty reason, justified by some lawmaker (who may be Scottish or English), Scottish notes are not 'legal tender' in Scotland or England.

IIRC there is no ""legal tender"" in Scotland. (I've just checked, apparently ""legal tender"" only applies to the coinage in Scotland - no-one's notes are ""legal tender"" up there, including the English ones!).

&gt; So I could go into the Clydesdale Bank offices in Edinburgh (where i believe they are) and request my £5/10/20 in sterling.

If banks were still doing the ""Promise to pay the bearer on demand"" thing, they'd give you that in the form of a Bank of England note - you're not going to get any precious metal. You try to cash in that phrase from a Bank of England note and you don't really get anything.

WRT to an Englishman accepting Scottish notes - as someone that doesn't interact with Scottish notes on a regular basis, and the variety of them, I'd certainly be uneasy accepting (lots of) them to some degree because someone would be more likely to pass off fake Scottish notes to me than fake English notes.

&gt; I hope this doesn't read as Anti-English in any way. I don't intend it to. In my opinion, both notes should be accepted in each country as they are worth the same. I can't think of a justifiable reason why they shouldn't be (I'm aware of the bailout but the distinction arose before then). Both economies can back their own currency.

Currencies don't work like that though. If Scotland were independent and wanted a Scot's Pound pegged at 1-1 with the British Pound, but had their own monetary policy they'd end up drifting apart. See the Eurozone mess. Within the union if you wanted Scottish banks issuing their own currency, with their own backing, it'd break monetary policy. The banks don't back their notes, the economy does, thus a Scottish bank can't back issuing another £100m of notes without inflating the economy by that much (unless of course, it were backed by £100m of ""Bank of England"" notes, thus taking £100m out of the Bank of England's circulation).",0,1399022611,null,0,false,0,ch7m4qu,t3_24b110,t1_ch7m4qu,t1_ch7fdzz,null,1433617249,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"Brazil's football confederation has expressed frustration over recent years that their best players go full bore for their respective clubs during the regular season and find themselves exhausted come the World Cup.

Oscar has won the U-20 World Cup, and the 2013 Confederations Cup the latter which was a real show of Brazil's squad strength ahead of 2014. He also looks to be the main attacking midfield option for the squad going into Rio. 

Brazil wants to win this year, and there's probably some pressure on the players to leave something substantial in the tank before June 12 rolls around. Oscar will probably start most of the games in Rio, so it wouldn't be surprising if he started to gear down towards the end of the season to save himself. He eliminated his competition at the club and he's in his sophomore season, I guess he thinks he can get away with relaxing and letting his form dip, especially on a World Cup year.

Value for money is a very difficult thing to judge. Lallana has proven himself a goal scorer, a creator, and a constant threat in the PL. I can't think of another guy who we could possibly sign who we can say that about.

Sure, there are players doing well in leagues across the globe. But the transition is never so perfect. Lallana basically plays on a side that plays like we do. I can see him finding some real joy with us. 

That said, again, I fear our signings. In reality, if you look at us since Brendan took charge, only Sturridge and Coutinho could be considered resounding successes for their price. Mignolet might've been good value for money but will be be here for years to come? I'm not convinced. Is Sahko worth what we paid?

And that's two players who have been very very very solid for us.

Then you've got Allen, Borini, Aspas, Alberto, Ilori. I think all those guys deserve time to prove themselves. But, right now, they are neither successes nor failures.

true,SatansBawsack,null,null,"You're totally right about the legal tender. It's only coins that are legal tender in Scotland. That is one of the most confusing things. If it's not legal tender in your own country, then why have a currency? An error on the lawmakers part, I think. 

As for the 'promise to pay the bearer', the banks do not have a choice. As I said, the Scottish legal system is different to England, particularly in the area of contract law and obligations. A unilateral promise, in writing such as the note, is legally binding. They have to give you your sterling.(Not to say they won't add a surcharge for the trouble.). The banks have to count on people not doing this but it's not really a concern. It's not easy or practical to carry around lumps of metal. They couldn't give you a Bank of England note and tell you to go there (where you MAY indeed get nothing for it -I agree- as English law on 'promises' is different) as this is not fulfilling the obligation.

As for my point that I would accept both notes in both countries, I can see that, in England, fraudsters would be more likely to try and pass off fake Scottish notes as genuine. The only solution I can see to that would be something like having the national animal or something (England =lion, Scotland = unicorn) watermarked on the note and having this publicised to both countries so they know how to check. 

And for your last point, I'll concede that I know less of inflation than I should (past the  point that more money printed means everything rises in cost respectively as the currency becomes worth a little bit less - with there being more of it). Therefore, I can't speak of what we should do about Scotland's money-printing privileges just now. However, as to the Scottish notes already in circulation, they -as you said- must be backed by English notes. With our financial policies regarding the currency currently being a reserved matter for England, I don't see why this existing money could not be classified as legal tender (even if that means a necessary freeze on the ability to print money). Please point out any holes in that logic that I'm missing. 

Following that logic, if Scotland was to remain in the union with economic policy still determined by Westminster, could both countries' notes not be printed in a ratio matching their respective economies, with the Scottish notes being printed with the Bank of England's authority? (meaning the Scottish note wouldn't have to be separately backed by English notes as it is recognised by the BoE(who authorised it). 

We seem to have gotten ourselves in a mess regarding the currency when it didn't need to be so. Maybe Scotland shouldn't have joined the Union in the first place...",0,1399027584,null,0,false,0,ch7mvny,t3_24b110,t1_ch7mvny,t1_ch7m4qu,null,1433617658,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

This sums it up right here..Also I posted a video comp. elsewhere in this thread that is worth watching if anyone wants to see some of the stuff he did this season. Sadly it seems in the video about 3/4 of the balls he played had shit finishing on them, which you can't blame him for. 

This is a great post you've made and I for one an with you on the lack of love for him in this community. I think lots of people are angry @ Ramires for getting that suspension, which was totally his fault, and a stupid mistake. But lets not fault him on that for everything else he has given us this season, the man seriously never stops running. 

People who want to question is discipline stats? [Here you go](http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/Seasons/3853/Stages/7794/PlayerStatistics/England-Premier-League-2013-2014) sort by yellow and you will see that he is our team's highest offender. Which we all knew. But he only has 1 more than Ivanovic this season, and no one is talking about his yellows. Not to mention there are very few players on that list above Ramires that are even remotely considered ""great"" players. There are a few, but a majority of those guys are NOT better than Ramires.

Mixed response to the 'Outs'. Agree with Torres, Marin, Moses and Kakuta, for the reasons you have given. Would keep Eto'o for one more year - he provides an ounce of continuity, and we need more than two strikers. Someone of Eto'os quality who is winding down their career is perfect for this. Unsure about Mikel. He is not on the same level as Matic, but is still a quality DM. If Luiz gets cemented in his role as a DM, then perhaps Mikel becomes surplus to requirements, especially with some of the younger players coming through.

Agree with most of the return loanees. I think having these players in the squad learning from the best would be the better option. Think JT learning from Desailly. I do wonder if we are suffering from squad inflation though; with the likes of Kalas and MvG already pushing into the first team I'm not sure we have space for too many more top notch younger players. As perverse as it sounds, I almost hope we have a few injuries in the relatively low pressure early-mid seasons, to give a few of these younger players a shot.

Brazil and Oscar (for Chelsea, at least) are a unique case because Oscar is really the only guy for his squad role and Brazil is the host country.

Lukaku is a similar example but with a different set of circumstances. The prevailing discourse seems to be that Lukaku didn't want to ""fight"" for minutes all season because he needed consistency to make Wilmots' squad, so he went to Everton to develop and get regular starts. 

Belgium might not be the favourite to win the whole thing but they haven't been in a World Cup in over a decade, before South Africa the team wasn't even in the FIFA Top 50, their lowest ELO ranking was in 2009. 

Now you've got guys like Lukaku who want to be starting regularly, getting experience, and are trying to compete against other top talents to carve out a spot in the starting 11. In conjunction with other reasons, I wouldn't be surprised if this was a big factor in De Bruyne's move to Wolfsburg in the January window. Belgium has a lot of guys who can play in the middle, and De Bruyne's minimal appearances at Chelsea weren't helping his chances to book a ticket to Brazil.

At any rate, I think this is temporary. Whether you're on Oscar's side of the divide (rest) or Lukaku's (activity).

I think this window, with Mourinho lining up for his second year, we need to sign some top quality world class players. Put good money towards a striker with a proven track record at the top level and a midfielder to play alongside Matic.
Strikers for me would be : Cavani, Benzema or perhaps Costa.
Midfielders: Vidal, Kroos, Khedira or Pogba (unlikely though)

We also need a left back, Luke Shaw is the obvious choice for me, it would give us a more rotatable defence and allow Luiz more time in the midfield.

The only players to come back from loan would be Lukaku and Courtois, but those such as Piazon and Thorgan who have performed well in other leagues would be loaned to lower Prem teams, with fresh youngsters off to Vitesse.

Leaving the club would be the likes of Torres Ba and Mikel. They could all leave for reasonable fees and I feel like while they all bring something to the team, they haven't done quite enough this season and lack the top quality of a team looking to challenge on all fronts.

Players out of contract is tricky; Terry will clearly be given another year, but there are doubts over the rest. I think Schwazer will leave and retire or head to Aus, Cole could well leave if we're serious about Shaw, and Lampard will ultimately be spared for another year. Eto'o could stay, but if Lukaku is back and a new striker signed he wouldn't play much. Saying that I'm sure he's be happy to sit in the stands collecting a big pay packet.

&gt;As I try to show in my new book, Economics: The User's Guide, most of economics can be understood by anyone with a secondary education, if it is explained accessibly.

He's trying to sell his book by writing an article with a provocative title that panders to the public's sense of importance.

Japan's lost decade was a period of very low growth despite super low interest rates and was an extended period of time. The UK has been through a dramatic shock (with the rest of the world) and is now recovering under a regime of fiscal stimulus, they just aren't the same. The wider EU however is just now risking a Japan style situation when interest rates are effectively 0% and growth is still not happening. Thats why they are talking about QE or maybe even negative interest rates.

&gt;Could you tell me in what way Economics is a Science (like physics and chemistry) as apposed to a Social Science (like psychology, anthropology, sociology etc)?

A social science is still a science, bit of STEM master race going on there. Economists make predictions, they built models to test those predictions, they incorporate real world data into their models, sounds a lot like a science to me.

&gt;You lost me hear - he is an economist at Cambridge he can tell you how it works and it does not work like a science because it is based on political and moral judgments, even the econometrics is based on judgments of which statistics to use, how to use them, how to gather them etc etc.

I have to admit the article made so little sense I didn't even consider the prospect that he was an economist. However every disciple has a range of people at varying points in the spectrum, some economists even believe in Austrian economics for instance. But let me put it this way, in Physics there is currently a number of schools of thought on how to include gravity into the standard model, there isn't a lot of evidence around and people don't agree. Does that mean we should open it up to the general public to comment?

Who we keep, and if we bring Lukaku back is another question in its own right that depends on the actions of our current players. Torres looks to be staying, Eto'o and Ba have been rumored to leave. That being said if we were to sell Lukaku for extra funds is a decent question. Maybe bring in someone like Bony to backup Diego Costa, Cavanni, or Ballotelli.
Our next question is a CM player to pair along with Matic. While Luiz has been a great player in big games defensively, I personally think we are in need of a player who has a better passing ability. Someone who has a similar style to Xabi Alonso, Toni Kroos, etc. We are looking into William Carvalho as we speak, I would enjoy to see Kroos, Pirlo, Paulinho.
Last problem that I believe also leads to our lack of goals that may be unpopular. Ivaonovic. He simply does not have the attacking presence that need for our RB. It is time that we switch Dave back to his original posistion and look for a left footed player to play on the left side rather than handicapping Dave. Fabio Coentrao, Moreno, Shaw, or possibly just keeping Cole if he can find his old form.
Finally our goalkeeping posistion. It's a good problem to have but we have two world class goalkeepers.

So they (all) found a way forwards; was it perfect? No. Did it lead to peace? More or less. It becomes an argument similar to the atomic bomb - did it kill tens of thousands? Yes. Did it end WW2? Yes. And that last part (with the death toll being ultimately lower than an invasion) tends to negate the unpleasant choice in using it. Do you see the parallel? Or do you want to complain about the number of Japanese killed and then call anyone that points out that it ended the war an arrogant prick? Oh y, you've already done that.

So, in short, you go right on complaining that she was, er, a phoney for starting the process of bringing an end to the troubles. I mean, how very dare they? Should the relevant members of the RUC/ UDF/ IRA/Etc. be prosecuted? I'd say yes - that way nobody is under any impression that killing people as a means to an end is acceptable or has no consequences, but it also means we don't go back to blindly fighting faceless terrorists (or allowing security forces to do similar in return). 

But hey, she was a phoney, and based on your logic so was John Major and pretty much everyone else who had a hand in it.

&gt;You have no idea whether I agree with her negotiating with the I.R.A. or not

Which you've pointed out more than once, but haven't actually said anything else about it one way or the other (have you realised that wasn't the point of my first post yet?). I thought you might have understood that once insults are involved, I couldn't give *two fucks* what you agree or disagree with :-)  do give yourself a pat on the back for explaining what's common knowledge. You haven't bothered explaining why I'm arrogant for exploring your statement, or a prick for daring to ask questions - just repeated insults and listed events that everyone knows about.

&gt;so do not make arrogant assumptions, you prick.

That's three. Gosh, you're really doing well. :-)

It's actually about a case in which a foreign student was allowed to remain in the UK after his course finished because of his long-term relationship with a British woman.  The cat was one of many aspects of their life that they described in convincing the court that they were in a genuine relationship.  However, I don't think the government really doubted that: IIRC, the only serious dispute was over which government policies were in force at the time - the government eventually accepted that their own policies prevented them from deporting the man long before the case got anywhere near a European court.  But the lawyers and judges involved made a few jokes about the cat, and some idiots (the Telegraph, the Mail, UKIP, Theresa May, David Cameron...) somehow got the impression that this was what the whole case was about.",0,1399035855,null,0,false,0,ch7oq6k,t3_24hxpy,t1_ch7oq6k,t1_ch7eqdd,null,1433618529,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7

Someone posts a link suggesting unkown Croatian midfielder Gakslav Popalot might be a transfer target, it gets 20 downvotes, meanwhile it has 30 comments with people actually interested in finding out a little more about the player in question. Is he any good, strengths, weaknesses etc. 

The downvotes are because the paper in question isn't credible, and the discussion is sunk forever. Sometimes I'd like see what other folks on the subreddit think of a player I know nothing about. Maybe his hairdresser's cousin is on the sub and can tell us that he is a lifetime red, and is a sure thing to be the next Zidane. Or perhaps he's useless and an Everton fan to boot. 

I don't know, I'd just like a chance to discuss these type of posts. And I'm not talking about repeat posts (I don't want to see another post about Christian bloody Tello, unless he's actually leaning on something in Melwood).

If it's a rumour and it's presented as a rumour and it's not a repost then it should be open for discussion. It's not a mod issue either, it's just poor voting. I'm not asking for upvotes just that aggressive downvoting of rumours should stop.

And I'd welcome Lallana, he's one of my favourite players in the league this year, and looked very comfortable slotting into the England side as well.

I think Mignolet deserves more credit than he gets, he's a solid keeper, who adapted very quickly to our style of play. And can only really get better IMO. He's only 26, which is still very young for goalkeeper standards.

Allen: He's definitely a success in my book, solid passing, good vision, apart from the injuries he's had he's been very good in midfield for us.

Borini: Not had the best of time with us. And when he gets better at finishing, his excellent runs, pace and work ethic will pay off. So I'd agree that he's neither success nor failure.

Aspas: I really feel for the guy, he tries very hard, but just doesn't seem to do all that well. Perhaps nerves I don't know. More of a disappointment so far.

Alberto: Very young lad, who has shown immense maturity on the pitch when played, great touch, just needs to put on some muscle. He's one for the future and one I can see being very good for us.

LLori: Not really followed up much on the lad, so can't really comment.

The chances of failing the CBT are entirely dependant on how you are on the day. They are assessing how safe you are to allow you to go out on your own. Remember, a CBT isn't a licence, it's a certificate to prove you're safe enough to go out and learn. Motorcycling can be very dangerous. They want to know that you're keeping yourself out of danger. 

Common failures would be stuff like:

* Continuously forgetting to turn off indicators after your turn. 
* Not checking over relevant shoulder before manoeuvres. 
* Falling off lots. We all stumbled on our CBT, just work out why and try to combat it happening again.

I am, I should point out, in no way very experienced. But I have done my CBT and DAS only a few months ago, so these things are still fresh in my head.

People do sometimes have to come back and do a second day, but it's rare. 

Having not driven anything won't affect your ability to complete the CBT to be honest. Driving a car is in no way similar to riding a bike. The only advantages are the experience and sixth sense that you develop about what people are doing. 

To put it in perspective, I did my CBT 2 years ago, having driven a car for the best part of 20 years, but never touching a bike. I got through no problem and went straight on to the DAS. And at the worst, if you don't succeed with the CBT, you just have to book a second day and do it again, anyway. So at most you're 100 quid down, but it's pretty unlikely.

Provisionals are granted to allow you to use the roads, but with certain restrictions (must have L plates, be accompanied if in a car, not use motorways etc) until you pass your test for either bike or car (CBT doesn't count, I don't think).

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I feel the biggest thing is that we've not wasted big money since Brendan came in. It's impossible for every player we sign to be a roaring success, I think what's important is that the players we do sign for big money don't turn out to be expensive flops (Carroll [35m], Downing[20m], Aquilani[17m], Keane[19m]). Collectively the likes of Borini, Ilori, Aspas, and Alberto add up to quite a lot, but when you're only paying £7m for a player their value is unlikely to drop *that* much. We're at least not putting ourselves in a position where a player will drop £15m in value over two or three years in the same way that the likes of Carrol and Downing did. 

With players for the £10m mark it's really hard to totally fuck it up. Some players, like Aspas, might not be a success. Some players like Coutinho will seem a bargain. With £25m for Lallana I really can't see him ever maturing into a player where we think ""man we got a fucking good deal there"". Considering we paid £27m for Torres and £23m for Suarez, do you really think that Lallana will even remotely compare to either of those? 

I think if we pay £20m or higher for Lallana, the absolute *best* case scenario is that he turns out to be an OK signing and just about justifies his price tag. I can't see him in a couple of years making me feel like £20m was cheap. And then the worst case scenario is that he turns into another Downing and in two or three years we're having to sell him off to a mid-table club at a massive loss. 

I think it's good that Lallana is proven as a decent player, like you say, but I think he's also proven that he's not going to be an exceptional player, and I think that with that in mind it's hard to see why we'd be OK to pay more than £20m for him. Henderson has had a monster season, for example, and even now I still think that he's only starting to justify the £16m we spent on him.

No, they don't. Social responsibility is an abstract concept, touted by the same idiots who think property is theft, and everyone should share everything like we are living in a global Kibbutz. If it is not legally enforcible, it is meaningless.

There is no ""should"" ... they have no responsibility to do the job the government is sadly failing at by providing cheap housing for all.

And at the end of the day, the tenants signed the agreement. If you don't agree, don't fucking sign. It's that simple.

true,djs013,US,usa,"As my flair indicates I am a fan from the USA.  I am also a Miami Dolphin fan (NFL).  I bring that up, because I have noticed some similarities between the respective seasons of those 2 teams this year.   The Dolphins had a second year head coach, a second year QB, and so were young, but showing marked improvement.  They had a tough schedule; every schedule in the EPL is tough, couple that with cup appearances too, makes for a grueling season.  Many of the pundits thought the Dolphins would finish right around where they did, 8-8, due to this front office still transitioning, still rebuilding.  What was upsetting especially to fans and players alike, was the way it went down.  The dolphins started the season 3-0.  They had an internal issue, made public and it brought a downturn.  Through it all the dolphins controlled their own destiny with 2 games left in the season, against bitter rivals, neither of which was challenging for the playoffs.  As it worked out, win one, and they made the playoffs.  They were embarrassed in both as they only managed one score in 8 quarters of play.  

Chelsea FC, at the start of the season, everyone said this was a transition year, the return of the Special One.  He will need a few transfer windows to build the team to his liking.  So, everyone expected Chelsea to Challenge for Champions League play, and perform well.  They expected Chelsea to put up tough games in cup competitions.  In the League, there is still a chance for Chelsea to win it all, even slight.  Dropped points against lower half clubs have really hurt Chelsea in the title push, but that just adds fuel to Hazard's frustration allowing for the comments after the Atleico Madrid loss.

The similarity I see here is that as the season wore on, in both situations at one point it looked like the sky was the limit, and so, fans, and maybe even internally expectations went up.  When those new expectations went missed, because it was in embarrassing fashion, we as fans get so upset.  

TLDR: As the season wore on, good play allowed for increased expectations.  Those expectations weren't met in embarrassing fashion.  This led to great frustration in the ranks of fans.",0,1399041239,null,0,false,0,ch7qo3d,t3_24irs2,t1_ch7qo3d,t3_24irs2,null,1433619444,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

In modern football, full backs have to track forward on offense, and wingers have to mark these fullbacks or the defender is left with a 2 on 1 overload. Any player who thinks they are above these things is not playing football for the good of the team, they are just playing so they can look good.

Some of you might say ""Well Ronaldo doesn't track back"". There's two key differences here. 1) Real Madrid currently play a 4-4-2 so Di Maria or Isco can defend in front of the fullback. 2) Ronaldo has such blistering pace that he often scares the opposing fullback from even venturing forward. If the full back isn't making his runs, you can stay up the field. But Atletico's full backs were making runs all day and Hazard missed the plot.

This is constructive criticism and obviously Mourinho wants Hazard to stay.

Historic means ""very important in history or having a long history"", while historical refers to people who lived or events that occurred in the past or refers to things that are connected with or found in the past. For example, a historic event is an important event of history, while a historical event is any event that happened in the past whether important or not.

true,ActuallyfromAlnitak,null,null,"As I understand it, in the multi-verse theory, you've done the thing, and not done the thing, and also done some other things, and occasionally exist in a world where none of them are done, all at once. When you travel in time you skip along different timelines, even running into a different version of you, provided they haven't gone traveling as well. The TV show ""Sliders"" was a fairly accurate representation of this theory. 

Call me a pragmatist, but I personally believe time is an illusion. That we've already done everything we are going to do and the only reason we can't see the future is because we are stuck inside the moment of expression. If we were standing outside of the universe we would realize it's all happening at once, and that time is just the filter our brains impose upon the universe to keep us from going mad. However, if we were standing outside of the illusion of time, no one would be able to see us either. To see us would break the illusion so it is therefore rejected. 

If time is an illusion then I'm certain there are time ""travelers."" In fact, they are existing simultaneously now, but we won't see them until we learn to press through our self imposed filters. Ironically, they may have already worked out a way to see and interact with us without destroying our minds -- as they are more advanced then us, but like a perception filter, we choose not to see them, because it would destroy our illusion of time and the human mind needs continuity. 

Under the ""Time Illusion"" theory the grandfather paradox doesn't exist. If time travelers have always been here and everything is happening at once, then no one ever killed their grandfather. Any attempt to rewrite history would be rejected as a break in the illusion, effectively making it impossible for the original time traveler to exist in the first place whilst simultaneously destroying the universe as we know it. Since we know the universe as we know it, its safe to assume no one ever attempted it. Then again, if the illusion is the only thing holding our perception of the world together, it's quite possible that if someone HAD gone back and killed their grandfather, we would simply remember it differently, in order to maintain the veil of illusion.

The human brain often hides things from us for reasons that are yet unknown. There are sounds we can't hear, light that we can't see because of it's spectrum, and movements we can't detect because our brain prefers a more concise overview. Even the nose on our face is carefully edited out of our thoughts despite it's constant presence in our peripheral vision. It's not too far a reach to expect that our perception of time is likewise limited.

Normally you get these kind of comments from players like him, from players that can't resolve a problem like we had in the first goal.

Eden is the kind of player that is not so mentally ready to look back to his left-back and to leave his life for him.  If you see the first goal of Atletico you completely understand where the mistake was and why we conceded that goal. The perfect team at the top level cannot make these kinds of mistakes.""

Hazard was completely at fault on the first goal and if we go into half with a 1-0 lead its a completely different game.  That said I hope Hazard responds to this by working harder at that aspect of his game instead of whining about it.  If he cant improve that however we should look at playing him in a position where he is more protected defensively.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"When I was a kid, many, many years ago I was taught that rhyme as, ""Eeny, meeny, miney, moe, catch a fishie, by its toes...""  Young enough, in fact, that it doesn't even occur to me to ask why a fishie would have toes.

Clarkson has a history of saying provocative things, sidling right up to and even past the line of acceptable behaviour and having a back-up position of plausible deniability.  ""Striking Civil Servants should be shot!"" says Clarkson.  ""Oh, no, no.  **I** didn't say that, I was reading out a text message!"" says Clarkson.

It's difficult to believe that he didn't think it was a good idea to *seem* like he said it.  Otherwise the whole issue is resolved by clearly saying piggy, or fishie, or whatever you want instead of mumbling.

*""One of the arguments most often used over that period – during which there has been a ferocious debate about the racist nature of Ukip’s campaign – is that the word “racism” is actually used to stifle debate. It’s thrown presumptively in the face of anyone who dares to raise any legitimate issue, from increases in immigration to the nature of Britishness.""*

**This** is entirely true, but the justification he goes onto is at best justification after the fact and more likely simply a self-serving lie.  I've discussed this with people who do this on many occasions over the years.  Their attitude has generally been that they're right to do it, because the opposing argument is wrong.  That the end justifies the means and that there is therefore no moral or intellectual imperative to address the matter on the level of ideas or reason.

This comprehensive failure is what leads him to a conclusion where he states:

*”This is the damage Ukip’s campaign has already done. In less than two weeks we have turned the clock back half a century.”*

Having failed miserably to acknowledge the fault of people like himself who shut others down with name-calling and criticism he concludes that this is the fault of UKIP.  That one party whose presence is predominantly wrapped around one quite affable fellow has turned back the clocks by five decades.

No blame attaches itself to the people with the *right* opinion apparently, even if it was their bullying that stopped the real progress he’s unhappy we haven’t made.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I'm going to carry on from the OP with Pep's first season...

Guardiola's first season is spent completely throwing out the counter attacking style that BR has been able to make so much success with.  Unfortunate casualties to Pep's style change are Sturridge, Gerrard, and Henderson.  Gerrard isn't well suited for tiki-taka and Pep gets sick of the long balls, the grate on his sanity and every time one goes wayward his left eye twitches a little bit until he can't take it anymore so he benches Mr. Liverpool himself.  Hendo's play isn't intricate enough, he's back to supersub duty.  Sturridge can't adapt to the more indirect approach that Guardiola is taking and Guardiola outright refuses to ever start a game with a traditional stiker ever again.  Poor Studge never even got a look in.  Lucas comes back into prominence as Liverpool's shittier version of Busquets and Pep begins to make good on the Welsh-Xavi nickname that Allen's picked up by shaping him into Xavi 2.0.  Allen even shows up for training one day with his hair spiked up by 2 gallons of hair gel and covered in spray-tan, even looking to emulate that mesmirizing olive skin that Xavi wears so well in the hopes that it'll seduce defenders into making mistakes against him.  

Pep brings in Montoya and Pedro from Barca immediately and in an outrageous coup that could only ever be possible because of the allure of playing under Guardiola, he manages to coax Thiago out from Bayern after a drawn out saga in which Thiago mentions having only ever dreamed of playing for Liverpool.  Suso comes back and finds a place in the squad immediately, but has a ahrd time breaking into the starting 11.  Reina comes back, suddenly all smiles and retakes the starting spot from Mignolet only because he can pass the ball.  Liverpool's first 11 looks like:

--------------Reina--------------

Montoya--Agger--Sakho--Johnson

--------------Lucas--------------

Sterling---Allen---Thiago---Pedro

-------------Suarez--------------

Subs: Mignolet, Ilori, Flanagan, Gerrard, Coutinho, Suso, Sturridge

Liverpool isn't going to repeat their title.  They're in a very tight scrap for 4th place with Everton.  The drama comes to a head when Liverpool drops 3 points to Chelsea at Anfield in the second to last game of the season in spite of having 81% possession and 96% pass accuracy across the team.  Pep sheds a tear in the post-match, claiming that Mourinho has wounded the very essence of football this day.  Allen completes his full transition into the actual Welsh-Xavi in an interview the next day when he claims ""the scoreline doesn't tell the real story, look at how much we won the possession.  Deciding who wins by goals is disgraceful and should be done away with, keeping the ball is the real measure of a team's quality."" 

Thankfully Liverpool manages to win the penultimate game of the season 6-0 against a hapless Norwich with Suarez scoring all the goals and pip Everton to 4th place on goal difference.  United is still jacking themselves off in the Europa league spots going on about how they can sign all the top players because they're Man United.  Top 3 are City, Chelsea, Arsenal in that order.  Newcastle, Villa, and Leicester get relegated.  

At the end of the season there's some pressure on Guardiola about the drop from winning the league to scraping by into 4th place.  Guardiola makes it clear that he believes more that his ideas work more, and that he's happy that he can play without a true striker again because Suarez can drop deep as a false 9.  He is adamant that all he has are his ideas and that his ideas are the right ideas.",0,1399042592,null,0,1399045569,0,ch7r8vr,t3_24iw7q,t1_ch7r8vr,t3_24iw7q,null,1433619716,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

He is going to say something that helps keep his name at the top of the list for a manager spot for someone, he will continue to drive home his confidence and the fact that he has the highest PL winning % of any Spurs manager.  He is marketing himself to other clubs.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"Well the first link is talking about the potential benefits of actual hate speech. FWIW I agree with it that the wild eyed loons of racism, homophobia and such are great assets to the general fight against discrimination.

The fact is people who care about actual racism (and I do) need to take care that we don't construe an innocent and minor non-slip up (attempted slip up? almost slip up?) with racism. Every time we let something ridiculous go we damage the case that racism is even something that is real. The BNP and other idiots operate in this space of ""look what they did to Clarkson! Is that reasonable?"" and while most will see the difference there will be some who'll resonate with the injustice of it.

This is about a person who's not intended to make hate speech, has actually not made hate speech and has removed anything that might have been construed as hate speech from the public sphere by reshooting the scene.

Is Clarkson a racist? The fact he stops and mumbles suggests not. Probably the last time he spoke that rhyme those were just the words that were in there and hit struck him as he was repeating it years later. If he was a racist he would not have stopped.

There is another angle to this. The private media has been at war with the BBC since day 0.

I mean, the guy was just crowned Young Player Of The Year and came second in the Player of the Year then days after apparently he is not committed? Not only had he just come back from an injury he was supposed to be the 3rd left back on the pitch apparently.


Typical Mourinho blaming everyone but himself, Hazard shouldn’t have been back there anyway if it wasn’t for the 10 men defence tactic that has become custom in any games with significance - and this after his attack on Big Sam, I’m sure we are all embarrassed by the hypocrisy... oh wait everyone was fuming that day on here when we played West Ham but everyone has quickly embraced parking the bus when we do it, how things chance!

-Lost at Villa

-Lost at Crystal Palace

-Beaten by Sunderland

-Won 1-0 against a 10 man (for 75min) Swansea

-Parked bus at Atletico never looked like scoring

-Parked bus at home v Atletico when we should have been attacking.

-10 man defence against Liverpool

-Just scrapped it v PSG

I guess all this is because of Hazard and his non commitment ey?


I will give credit where its due but most people on here since to have Mou tinted glasses and apparently he can never be wrong, During games sometimes I sit and wonder if everyone really enjoys the park the buy style of play Mou goes for almost all the time now..... I thought winning the champions league a few years ago was the achievement that meant we could now build something new, a young team with free flowing football but alas. 


Sold Mata, sold KDB, Loaned Lukaku and now Hazard might be following them this summer it looks like Mourinho 2.0 will pretty much be more of the same from years ago.


Mou is a legend there is no doubt but I wonder how many of you guys ever saw us play before Abramovich, I would honestly settle for the style of play and legends of old like Zola, Poyet, Andre Flo, Di Mateo, Gullit and so on at least those days we were entertained on the regular.


Against Atletico we lost to a better team but it makes me sick how it seems like its a crime to blame Mourinho, he is the Manager so he should get it all the praise and the stick. 


At the end of the day no one should be bigger than the club, players or the manager. Mou will be one of the greatest of all time but gosh his ego is and his behaviour or comments etc are embarrassing sometimes, believe it or not guys some of us fans just want to support our teams and see it play football in an entertaining way and for our manager to behave himself win lose or draw but I guess thats too much to ask.


Oh and I just watched us win the U21 semi final v City yesterday, was saddening think virtually none of the players would even get a sniff of first team football under Mou... heres a fun game to play.. name a couple of players Mou brought through from the young ranks throughout all his career?

You obviously know nothing about property ownership or norms if you think it's a ""simple concept"", it at the centre of all debates over economics and political economy, and thus nearly all debates in political philosophy. 

Should property rights be more important than everything? Including human life? Absentee property shouldn't exist. Ownership should be based on occupancy and use. If you're not using a house to a reasonable socially defined standard then someone who needs a house should be able to use it. The concept of property rights you're proposing isn't some trans-historical phenomenon; it's relatively recent to human existence. In fact if you look at the basis of property in the UK about 60% originated from squatting, i.e. ownership based on occupancy and use, of course since then it's been transformed into private property where by those with property exploit those without, with the right of increase going to those that own and no those responsible for the increase.

you cannot employ concepts of rights if the right being exercised aren't equal.

The rights landlords have it to determine whether the tenant has a house or a shelter to live under. Any talk of rights is completely meaningless because it obscures the self-evident inequalities of power in this relationship between the landlord and the tenant. The landlords are in the ability, because they own property, to exploit those who don't own property, not only is that exploitation wrong, but it's basis is wrong since most private property was founded itself upon force or squatting.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Saying ""no quotes"" or ""club sources"" automatically rubbishes a story isn't quite accurate....you need to again consider the outlet.

Some of the more reliable reporters and outlets will frequently use ""club sources"" or uncredited quotes to ensure that their source has plausible deniability to their employers.

Its relatively common for quotes or information to be given from unnamed sources (not just in sports), you just need to be wary of the outlet that is distributing the story. The Telegraph has some excellent writers (they also have some shithounds) on staff who frequently will not cite a source, its not because the source is made up or unreliable its because they want to ensure they continue to get stories from that source.  Di Marzio only gives quotes when it has been cleared by the source. BBC will use sources without crediting the name. 

If you see a story from a fairly reliable outlet (with a proven track record) that doesn't reveal sources it doesn't mean it isn't legit. 

On the other hand if you see a story from an outlet that isn't particularly reliable or downright dubious (The Metro and the Mail often sound like the stories are coming from message boards) then yes you should be sceptical.

So, it still remains a minefield to walk in to figure out if a story is legit or not.",0,1399045316,null,0,false,0,ch7sggn,t3_24ixiw,t1_ch7sggn,t1_ch7p8sw,null,1433620286,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

You know full well that he was not arrested for imposing himself on anyone, but for ""hate speech"" - a ludicrous term that anyone saying anything could be convicted under.

I know Wisdom is about 21, and in my opinion ~23 is the point where you can really start talking about scrapping a player who you previously thought had lots of potential. The alternative in my mind would be if Wisdom started getting a lot of first team opportunities and looked very poor or inconsistent and didn't seem to be improving throughout the season...in that case I'd be a lot more receptive to talk of dumping him. Like with Shelvey, whose inconsistency really did shine through and he started to seem like a good kid to go ahead and sell despite his age.

The New Enterprise Allowance (NEA) is a transition for people claiming JSA and similar benefits to move into self-employment. They pay you an amount equal to your JSA for 3 months then half that for another 3 months. In addition you may be eligible for working tax credit, council tax support and Housing Benefit.

Of course if your business does well then you'll come off these benefits but it's worth considering that the safety net is still there if you want to try business.

Start up costs are a big deal. If you can come up with a low investment idea it should help you a lot. A friend is setting up a fast food business. He really wanted to get a van costing £20k. To my great relief he couldn't get a loan for that much and is starting much smaller. With his new business plan he only needs to sell 50 burgers a day to cover costs. That's so much more achievable. (I love him to bits but he does tend to bite off more than he can chew).

The NEA in my area offers a loan of up to £2500 at 6% interest.

We spend ten times this amount on servicing debt, almost 12 times as much on welfare, about 30 times as much on pensions and almost the same again on healthcare. These proportions grow even more if you factor in local govt spending.

Yes the MOD has had some ridiculously stupid acquisition problems, but lots of these are caused by moronic decisions taken by politicians for political reasons, eg. Gordon Brown delaying construction of the new aircraft carriers for a year or more, adding billions to the cost. Or cutting equipment numbers so that the cost per unit spirals upwards, making them seem less affordable so they all end up getting cut (see Nimrod).

&gt; You know full well that he was not arrested for imposing himself on anyone, but for ""hate speech"" - a ludicrous term that anyone saying anything could be convicted under.

Factually incorrect. Read the OP. He was arrested for two counts: 1. failure to obey a police dispersal order (you know, the one he was given because he was pissing everyone around him off with his megaphone antics) and 2. inciting racial or religious hatred. That second point is not one that ""anyone"" can get arrested under, especially not charged, it's one that you get arrested under if you are giving a big speech about how another race or religion is unwelcome in Britain and there's plenty of evidence because you're doing it in public like Weston.

The whole thing about responding to Hazard and Lukaku I don't a hundred percent agree with but those guys complained to the media first and so Jose simply responded.

But he has a great reputation of having good relationships with his players and he's praised Hazard all season so I honestly wouldn't worry too much here.

true,ihopeitsnormal,null,null,"Okay, so my initial qualifier is that the 4-4-2 is utilized in the big matches. That being said, let me break this down for you. Okay, so here is the listed formation for the Bayern Munich second leg. Looks good for you at the moment. http://i.imgur.com/zSPJAW4.jpg

But we need to examine how the team actually plays when the match kicks off. A formation can only tell you so much. Firstly, I will only be examining the first 20 or so minutes of the match because after the game went 2-0 and the tie is over, rigidity of formation breaks down. How Real plays when the match is close is what really matters.

A minute and a half in:
http://i.imgur.com/4iLVdhy.jpg 
That looks like a very well disciplined set of two strikers, making sure to stay close together and linked up, backed by a line of four. This is an image from very early on of Real Madrid in a hostile atmosphere. In one of their biggest matches of the season, when they need their best performance, this is the tactic Ancelotti has chosen.

http://i.imgur.com/JeHeHRr.jpg
Modric slightly in front of Alonso. Bale as RM, Di Maria as LM. 

http://i.imgur.com/PZ6uTWX.jpg
Unlike other matches where Bale was given more license to roam, here we see him providing cover for a stepping Carvajal. This would become a theme for the match. The 4-4-2 allows for a defensive overload of the wings which is beneficial when you are up against the likes of Robben and Ribery.

Later on in the match:
http://i.imgur.com/rS4OfW0.jpg
Hmm, I guess the 4-4-2 in the opening minute and a half wasn't an accident. Again we see Carvajal pressing the ball (nearest RM player to the ball) and Bale providing backing for him. I was actually very impressed with the defensive discipline shown by Bale in this match because against Barca in the Copa final he played in Ronaldo's role of no defensive discipline so it was nice to see how his game could translate.


http://i.imgur.com/abvBfWw.jpg
Here we see a fast break where Di Maria sends a flighted ball forward from the left flank. Ronaldo and Benzema, the two stikers, are the only two up top together. The midfield has some license to break forward, but their main task this match (at least while the tie was still close) was to provide a defensive line of 4 in front of their defenders.

That's about it, I guess. But I suppose the fact that you said you watch RM on Bein makes your argument so much more compelling than mine. If you would like further proof, I would be glad to break down the Copa final for you but if you're willing to take my word for it, in that match Bale played the role of Ronaldo as a LF with Benzema retaining his RF spot. Isco came in and fulfilled a disciplined LM performance with Di Maria moving to RM.

But I don't blame you for wanting to, so here goes. First of all, I'd suggest that you ignore the Premier League. A lot of people would say I'm mad about that, especially as it's by far the easiest league to follow from America, but that makes it too easy: the passion just isn't there and most fans are just part-time glory hunters that watch on TV occasionally; supporting a lower league team requires dedication and it's much more exciting. The leagues are completely undpredictable and there's promotion and relegation, and the fans are brilliant.

My club, Southend United (I'm sure you can google them to find out about the history and stuff but it's not very exciting so I won't bother) are in League 2 - the 4th tier, it's confusing I know - but we're in the play-offs this season so our next 3 games after tomorrow will decide if we get promoted... the perfect time to start supporting us! The play-off games will be on TV too, so you can watch from the USA. 

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have!

By the way, I'm the mod of /r/southendunited so come join us if you want (although it's a bit empty over there atm) and there are quite a few of us at /r/leaguetwo, not forgetting of course /r/soccer.

Usually when this happens, players who are in better field position collapse to take over the duties of the players that have been beaten. The beat players then hustle to cover the positions of the players that have been dragged away by the run of play. This is what happened prior to the start of this gif, hence why Cole is playing essentially the CB position. You'll notice that this isn't the problem at all; everyone may be out of their position, but every Atletico player is marked, up until Eden loses his man. The reason I believe many people are saying he left Cole exposed is because with Cole dragged away from his duties to cover for a defensive mistake earlier in the run of play, tactically Eden is responsible for taking over Cole's duties until he can return to them. This is one of the ways wingers/wide midfielders provide cover for their fullbacks. By failing to adequately cover Cole's duties (i.e. not tracking/marking the far post run), he's left Cole ""exposed.""",0,1399049324,null,0,1399049553,0,ch7ubm6,t3_24jrgw,t1_ch7ubm6,t1_ch7sivs,null,1433621231,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Obvious, if an animal is diseased, it should not find its way onto our tables - 1 : 0 to religion. We still have that rule today: in the UK condemned meat is painted blue to ensure it doesn't turn up in supermarket freezers.

However, the problem comes from modern interpretation of those rules. 

The pre-stunning from devices like captive-bolt guns clearly damages the animal; the object to render it unconscious. 

At this point the rabbi or mullah steps in and says: *wait up, dude. This animal is *sick*. It can't be used for meat.*

Slaughterhouse says (along with all reasonable human beings) *Um, no. This is just the first phase of the slaughter. The animal was perfectly well when the slaughter process started, and that fulfils your religious requirements. Plus, if we don't use this method, animal dies painfully and in terror. This way - more humane*

*Nuh-uh*, replies the religiotard. *Fuck your humane killing, who the fuck cares about animals? They don't have souls. This animal is now sick.

true,defnoodle,null,null,"Yeah, Rodgers did say he wanted some top players, and we will get some. I know the caliber of player we've been linked to and I would love to see those players at Liverpool. I personally wasn't being holier than thou. In fact when I said we would go for one or two top players,  the 30 million range and up was what I was thinking, because that's what you pay for that type of player now days. I know LFC is a massive club. I don't think we're some rag tag rec team made good.

When I was listing the young players, I wasn't saying play all the youth all the time. I was just pointing out that we have a number of players at the cusp of the first team. Why not give the most talented ones a chance? Of the players I listed above if 2 or 3 get at least 15 games in all competitions , then I'd consider that a good year for internal squad expansion. Player development is one of Rodgers' strong points so we might as well take advantage. 

Some issues will be addressed in the transfer market and we should have a fairly busy summer. But some people seem to think that since we're in the Champions league we have to be ready to compete with real Madrid and Bayern right away.  Hopefully we can, but we don't have to rebuild the team to do so. I know we're not perfect, but we just pulled off a sweet 11 game win streak and are still top of the league for now. So after a few moves, I think coaching is gonna be a huge factor.  man u are going to spend big this summer and Chelsea might get their fabled striker so I think prices are going to be high and we may lose out on some prime targets. That's why I would rather focus on what we have and what we can control.

Of course it's all speculation and time will tell. What ever happens I'll support the team and enjoy the ride.

I think this is what is starting to happen to Willian. Is he showing everyone he is a £30m goal threat? no, but he's showing why they paid £30m for the footballer as a whole, and his importance to the team reflects that, and the qualities they bought him for allow him to adapt his game to suit the needs of the team.

Alves was the victim of a racist gesture who more or less mocked that gesture by making it seem like no big deal--it was a way of saying ""I'm above this and you can't hurt me.""

The difference with the yiddo chant is that, while Spurs have historically Jewish roots, the people chanting it are often not Jews. Imagine a bunch of white fans chanting nigga at their players--even if it's positive, it's not really their word to own. So even if the chanters are trying to overcome racism, can you see why the people who have been oppressed with that word might be a little offended?

It's a different situation, but look at the Washington Redskins in American football: the nickname is a straight up slur. The fans use it positively, and for all I know some may use it in an attempt to take away the negativity of the word. But many Native Americans are offended because it's a word with a history of hate that (most of) the fans using it haven't suffered. It's a word that they don't fully grasp the importance of.

This is how I personally view it. Certainly, saying 'the N-word' is racist now, there is no question of that- but you cannot deny the truth that that is how the original version goes, and by his age, the version Clarkson was most likely taught by a parent or grand-parent. 
He clearly realised that it is no longer acceptable to use this version, tried self-censoring, which didn't work, asked for this version to be removed and have a new version shot.

Should we go round and censor all the books published 100+ years ago when it was seen as an acceptable, everyday term?

In the story arc you're referencing, the Doctor or the Master (Sorry, I forgot.

River Song, the only non-Time Lord known to have the ability to regenerate, was conceived while the Tardis was in flight through the Time Vortex.

 The show seems to suggest that the ability to regenerate is an artificially endowed ability rather than a biological one, the result of being exposed to the energies of the Time Vortex somehow filtered through some sort of Time Lord technology. Assuming this is how it works, Gallifreyans only had to consider a subset of the population when accommodating for regeneration in their planning, the majority might have only been limited to a single incarnation. 

In addition the Gallifreyans were not only a highly advanced spacefaring people, they also had access to ""bigger on the inside"" dimensional/space distorting technology. Not being bound by the constraints of being bound to the normal space of a single planet, I doubt population control would be a big issue.

* Imperial War Museum in Duxford, just south of Cambridge. This is the Aviation arm of the IWM which has a large number of aircraft on display, as well as exhibits from other areas of war. Definitely worth a visit during a spare day or two in Cambridge, if you have any.
* Colchester - One of the principal Roman towns in Britain (or Britannia as it was known then), Colchester has a really great museum dedicated to the many Roman artefacts found in the area.
* Hastings - **What I thought was the** Home of the Bayeux tapestry ~~detailing the events of the Norman Invasion in 1066.~~ A copy of the tapestry is in fact in a museum in Reading which is free and accessible as a day trip! Hastings is also a good day out by the sea (depending on the weather!)
* Portsmouth - Home of the Historic Dockyard where you can find the World's oldest commissioned ship, HMS Victory (older than the USS Constitution which is the oldest commissioned ship *still afloat*) on which Lord Nelson led his fleet to victory over the French and Spanish at Trafalgar, and where he was shot and killed, the HMS Warrior, the World's first Iron hulled warship, and The Mary Rose, the remains of one of the large battleships of King Henry VIII which sank in the Solent in 1545, and was raised in 1982 after being re-discovered in 1971. It is housed in a specially constructed building whilst it is sprayed with a preservation solution. There are also lots of other exhibits here, including a sail loft, and action-oriented exhibits. There is also a submarine museum across the bay from Portsmouth in Gosport.
* Bath - The location of the Roman Baths (from which the town got it's name) as well as a few museums, including the American museum in Britain - reputedly the only museum of Americana outside of the USA (or so they claim) as well as a few fashion museums etc. Plus it's got a lot of nice-looking historical buildings. It's so nice in fact that Hitler banned the bombing of it during the war because he wanted to preserve it for himself.
* Beaulieu - Home of the Baeulieu motor museum and a nice day out in the country. Also in this category is the Brooklands motor museum, home of the Brooklands motor racing circuit where a lot of world speed records were set at the dawn of motor racing. There is also an aircraft museum there as Brooklands was the home of the Vickers Aircraft Works. There is a Concorde on display here as well as planes that have been restored or built by enthusiasts such as a Sopwith Camel.
* River and Rowing museum in Oxford - speaks for itself really... ;-)

true,backtowriting,null,null,"I don't know what the law is in this case, but I would strongly argue that it *should* be legal for authors, artists and performers, scientists and political candidates to express thoughts and ideas that others might call racist.  

There should be no limit to intellectual thought - to our ability to ask questions and to talk about controversial issues.  Or else, how can we determine the truth of those issues?

Here's an example of the sorts of problems you face if you ban racist language.  

i) An atheist writes a book criticizing religion.   A Muslim finds the chapter on Islam to be offensive and has him prosecuted for hate speech.

ii)  A scholar wants to write a criticism of Mein Kampf only to find out that it's illegal to even purchase the book.  The criticism goes unwritten.

iii) A documentary maker wants to make a film about racism, but isn't allowed to film actual racists without censorship.  His documentary goes unmade and the racists go unchallenged.

iv) A scientist discovers that a particular ethnic group is susceptible to Alzheimers.  She's accused of promoting the idea that e.g. Albanians are stupid and the research is censored.

v) A holocaust denier has his book banned. His readers instead circulate copies by email and the book's arguments go uncontested.

vi)  Reddit becomes blocked by the UK government after it refuses to submit to self-censorship of racist comments.  

And I could list many many more possibilities.

Our players don't really fit any system right now, so it's a lot easier to just say, go defend with your lives, than to try and teach old dogs new tricks.

We are evolving to play a style much like what Real Madrid is playing now. Defend deep, and transition quickly into the counter with pacy wingers and a striker who can hold the ball up if need be, but we just don't have the players for that. We saw glimpses of it during the City game at the Etihad, but right now not all our players can play like that all the time. Players turn off and revert their individual styles of play and the system falls apart.

true,Gorgash,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"The UKIP might not be a racist party but their anti-EU stance and the fact that their campaign focuses heavily on migrant workers tends to attract people with racist sentiments. Even some of their ministers have been lambasted recently for making racist comments. I don't know much about Nigel Farage - maybe he is genuinely not a racist guy, but he is just one guy. The UKIP has lots of members and some are going to be more racist than others.

Your average bloke in the pub might be blaming immigrants for the lack of jobs (or decent paying jobs) going around, but the problem goes deeper than that. We're seeing capitalism at work in pretty much full force. If people are willing to work for less pay and for less rights, they're going to be picked for the job. But people often don't have a *choice* in the matter. They might *want* more pay and more rights, but that doesn't mean they'll get it unless workers in the country are organised en masse and across different industries to create a powerful labour union. Right now companies are doing everything in their power to minimise the cost of labour. For example Asda are making some pretty huge changes to reduce the number of managers each store has, but gaining more bottom-level colleagues (who might only have 15 hour a week contracts at that). It'll be great for Asda's bottom line, not so great for their workers who want to earn a living wage there.

Still, if we were becoming a more racist society you'd see parties like the BNP gain more support (and as far as I know they haven't). Wanting to curb immigration isn't the same as being a racist. I sometimes think people have forgotten the very *definition* of racism. It is when you believe that your ethnic group is superior to other ethnic groups, or you find another ethnic group inferior to your own. It is judging somebody based on the country they come from, their culture, religion or the colour of their skin. Some people might want to curb immigration regardless of where people are coming from or what their skin colour is. I'm not anti-immigration but I do think that this gets compounded with being a racist too easily and makes it hard for people to put forth legitimate, well-rounded arguments for why too much immigration is bad for the country (if that is what they believe).

&gt;The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews, when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Muslims, O Abdullah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews. (related by al-Bukhari and Muslim).Sahih Muslim, 41:6985, see also Sahih Muslim, 41:6981, Sahih Muslim, 41:6982, Sahih Muslim, 41:6983, Sahih Muslim, 41:6984, Sahih al-Bukhari, 4:56:791,(Sahih al-Bukhari, 4:52:177)

So the antipathy towards the Jews is as old as Islam itself. Maybe it's got something to do with the reported poisoning of Mohammed by a Jewess which caused his death (see quote below). After all, Mel Gibson is still pissed off with the Jews for ""conspiring"" (how I think Mel would put it) to put Jesus to death.

Most of the signings have been good, obviously Torres has was a blunder. But, for the amount of money Chelsea has spent over 4 years, it is just not good enough. 

One might say a lot of those purchases are for squad depth. But, Chelsea has so many players on loan already or, why not just give academy players a chance? Was the likes of Salah and Moses really necessary for squad depth?

The case was an important decision on the free movement of labour and had a profound effect on the transfers of football players within the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) (EU).

&gt;The decision banned restrictions on foreign EU players within national leagues and allowed players in the EU to move to another club at the end of a contract [without a transfer fee being paid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_transfer_(soccer\)).

&gt;The ruling was made in a consolidation of three separate legal cases, all involving Belgian player [Jean-Marc Bosman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Marc_Bosman):

You do not know what you are talking about. I've been a tenant and a landlord and the tenant is always in the stronger position, whether they realise it or not. And of course the landlord doesn't ""just"" have to find a new tenant. If you are going to enter a debate at least try to get informed about the subject before contributing. Landlords need to ensure the property has been professionally cleaned, get evidence of this, cover the costs of any repairs or replacements needed, obtain those replacements and dispose of the originals (at new cost, not at second hand value which is all the tenant has to pay if it can't be put down to wear and tear), deal with updating required certificates, ensure meter readings are accurate, cover the mortgage costs during the vacant period, etc. etc.

Sorry to have a go at you in particular but it really pisses me off when people who don't realise how good they have it start complaining about how easy others have it without realising that the others have it a lot worse than they realise.

You're right in that the beat way to do this is through companies house. If you're confident you can do this yourself, otherwise an accountant will charge around £100-200 to set up. Then you make an appointment at a bank, barlcays santander natwest etc, to set up a company bank account.

Regarding tax, from this point on all this will be paid annually by tax returns in april each year, as opposed to directly from your wages by NI number and salary by PAYE.

So what you do is set aside 20% of your income and keep all receipts/invoices for expenses incurred by your work. Each month or year, give these to your accountant along with the 20% of your income. He/she will process your tax, minus any expenses, and give you the remainder back.

An accountant will charge from £200 up to a thousand to do your tax return per year, depending on your income and industry and a few other factors.

Plus side of limited, is no matter whether whether you earn £20,000 or £20million, the most tax you ever pay is 20%. Wheras as PAYE the tax bracket increases with salary, hence generally you'll have more in your bank account at the end of the year.

Down side of limited, paying the accountant their fees, the faff of collecting expense receipts/invoices.

Sleek [Eyebrow Stylist](http://www.sleekmakeup.com/eyes/eyebrows/eyebrowstylistmedium) 

This week, I got paid and went mad. I bought NARS Sheer Matte; my HG was Sheer Glow, but my face has been really oily lately and the foundation was just melting off. Sheer Matte is still a perfect match like Sheer Glow was (unlike Laura Mercier, where the same shade in different formulas was completely different). It's got a nice finish, not drying at all and gives nice coverage. It settles into the fine lines under my eyes, but that will just need some trouble shooting. 

I also bought the Sleek Eyebrow Stylist. I used to just use a matte shadow from MUA, but I think they discontinued the shade. So, I bought this, and it is amazing. It is just the right amount of colour and pigmentation for filling in my brows. It comes in three shades, and I was using the 'dark'. 

My last new purchase was No7 matte lipstick in Bare. Not much to say about it. It's pretty and long wearing. I think it could be my new MLBB shade.

QoS or Quality of Service is a system of providing a fair (or set) amount of bandwidth to a certain type of connections (Xbox, iPlayer, torrents etc) for users to ensure smooth running of the network. When you mentioned buffering I wondered if you were in IT and would be up for setting up a Firewall with pfsense or something but anyway it might be a bit much. 

Moving from EE to a 150mb Virgin or the top end BT infinity package (80/160mb) should just be enough for you all to live happily as long as no one torrents during the gaming hours. 

I can recommend the Asus range of routers (there will be differnt ones for Cable or DSL) so be sure to buy the right one shoudl you go with Virgin or or BT. There's also a basic Qos you can enable but it may cause issues so be aware.

&gt;

&gt;__Jean-Marc Bosman__ (born 30 October 1964) is a former Belgian [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football),  whose [judicial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial) challenge of the [football transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_transfer) rules led to the [Bosman ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosman_ruling) in 1995. This landmark judgement completely changed the way footballers are employed, allowing professional players in the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) to move freely to another club at the end of their term of contract with their present team.

&gt;Prior to the landmark trial, Bosman played for Belgian first division club [Standard de Liège](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_de_Li%C3%A8ge)  and [RFC Liège](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_Li%C3%A8ge) and won 20 caps for Belgium at youth level. While the trial was ongoing Bosman played briefly in the French lower leagues, and on the Indian Ocean island of [Réunion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9union).

&gt;Since Bosman won his case, it was claimed by *[The Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom\))* that he has lost the money he won from his case and has descended into alcoholism and depression whilst living on social benefits.  Some of his money was lost due to a bad investment in a special T-shirt line. Bosman hoped that the players who benefited from the Bosman ruling would support him by buying one of his T-shirts. He sold only one, to the son of his lawyer. In order to pay his taxes, he was forced to sell his second house and his [Porsche Carrera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Carrera).

I wouldn't say most, but yes, it is hefty for the advertiser. That is why LBC listing prices are higher than typical exchanges. Ultimately, this is actually a benefit on the seller side (the Australian) as you get more for your money. I would remind however, that I was replying to your comment, not OP. I made no assertions about it being the *best way*, merely that an exchange isn't required.

&gt;and you are also exposed to bitcoin fluctuations risk.

Depends how fast you are. In the same breadth however, you are also exposed to bitcoin fluctuation benefits.

&gt;if you transfer your bitcoins to an escrow, and the escrow goes bankrupt / gets hacked - yep, you are out of luck

The same is true with any service. Although I fail to see how the escrow system could go bankrupt. It isn't after all, based on any type of fractional reserve. What comes in, goes out. Admittedly the risk of hacking on these newer services is several degrees higher than a bank. Although the risk gap is smaller between comparable online services.

What is your point? Your city isn't in Australia. Unless you mean obtaining the bitcoins in the first place?
