But if there is a big group with a bit of coordination always singing, then it's so much easier to join in. I know that this definitely applies to me, anyway

In the clubs and Rodgers defense, a lot of these players didn't seem like bad business this year bar Lovren and Lambert, just misguided.

No the player at the base of the defense does NOT need to pass as well as Gerrard, what kind of ridiculous comment is that? So when Gerrard retires or needs to play less we can't play a single pivot anymore, great better enjoy it while we can I suppose. That position is the only barrier between mid and defense hence why we get split open, hence why the best defensive teams have great DMs, Barca, Chelsea, Atletico, Borussia etc... 

Gerrards amazing passing is just one outlet, a fairly ineffective one in a team as disjointed as ours at the moment. A DM would just need to recycle to Allen/Can/Henderson/Coutinho quickly and the team could work from there. I agree that the other two mids do most of the defensive work but that's because Gerrard is so inept in that department. With an energetic, athletic and specialised DM would free Hendo etc.. Up to attack much more.

You have already conceded that the tourism industry is smaller than it was. As you have not provided graphs or any more info on this, i will hypothesise that the tourism industry will continue to decline.

I also hypothesise that one of the main reasons for the decline is the ruination of the views of many famous highland vistas.

Based on rated power production, which is vastly higher than actual power production.

Even if by rated production Scotland should be getting 50% of its power from renewables, unless efficiency of renewables increases rapidly over the next 5 years, Scotland would only get, maximum, 10% of its energy from renewables *on a good day* (barring Hydro power).

The problem is should the Doctor be a woman are we (as a culture) so bad at writing strong female characters and making new shows with well written characters there's going to be just a gender swap on to a male character and that will make it work. On the other hand if they did blind auditions or something like that where every actor read for the Doctor and a female read it better than anyone else that's fine.  The Doctor has also been more or less completely celibate is his gender even an issue for him?  Maybe Time-Lords reproduce this way so that both genders can eventually have children. I'm just a little concerned by the Master / Missy's outfit when he/she regenerated and discovered they were now female did he raid his spinster aunts wardrobe or what?

As for whether my comment was speculation, of course it was. But it is just as likely a scenario as tourism growing again.

Oh, that's funny, i seem to remember that the Oil was a significant keystone of Salmonds campaigns for independence, before uncomfortable facts drove the oil subject to the back of the queue.

&gt;Oh, but how are you going to do that, seeing as:

The national grid doesnt extend to continental europe, however there is an already existing infrastructure link that allows france to give us energy.

&gt;Bit weird how you think Scotland has no capacity to export energy yet the rest of the UK has the capacity to import it, no?

No. Scotland is very far away from the continent. There is no link from Scotland to the continent that would allow it to trade energy. One would have to be built. It would have to be built through rUK waters, which would require permission. Permission which the rUK could deny for a variety of valid reasons.

Then Scotland would be up shit creek without a paddle or a boat.

This is not hard to understand.

1.  Moffat wrote Eccleston episodes The Empty Child and The Doctor Dances.  These episodes were just called back in the episode Mummy on the Orient Express by having the Doctor ask the mummy ""Are you my mummy?""

2.  The Ninth Doctor flips through a book at super speed, reading the whole thing in a moment and then commenting ""Sad ending."".  The Twelfth Doctor has bookcases surrounding the console room, hinting at his history of loving/hating books.

3.  The Eleventh Hour has tons of references to the Tenth Doctor.  The transition was gradual and not so slight as to be ignored in ""The Day of the Doctor"", the 50'th anniversary special by having the lines ""Timey-Wimey? from the War Doctor and.....""I have no idea where he gets that from."" spoken by the Tenth Doctor in response (granted, still a Moffat episode).

4.  Tons of references and callbacks to classic Doctor Who have been popping up in this season and with the Twelfth Doctor in general.  Everything from talking to his Fourth regeneration and then offering someone Jelly Babies to a character wearing a bow-tie and all-stars sneakers is being included in the eighth series.

4.  If Moffat doesn't like looking back, then why did the episode ""The Name of the Doctor"" begin with a scene in which the Doctor steals the TARDIS and it's the First Doctor, not some strange earlier incarnation.  Why did he bother bringing back ""you know where""?  Why did he bother bringing back ""You know who...tonight?""


edit: This current Doctor's love of books has been referenced many times in past seasons as well.  Moffat loves books (as should we all) and his love of books is reflected in the Doctor love/hating books.  The Doctor hates endings (we saw what happened) yet loves books.  The current Doctor is surrounded by books, by endings.  He must be looking for something.  Remember that this character has been to the biggest library in the universe and saved it, plus left his wife there to be saved.

Seems fair. You cant have your cake and eat it too.

Soldado is doing quite well in his false 9 role, but that's not why we bought him and that's why Adebayor and Kane get more playing time up front than Robbie.

Our only #10 is Eriksen. Lamela does great when he cuts inside and becomes a creator, but then you don't utilize his pace or ability to dribble at opponents. Chadli does this well too, but personally, I liked him as a back-up striker after his performance against Benfica. And his crosses and strength are other good qualities of a winger. Kane, though emerging as another #10, has shown a knack for scoring goals and he should continue to be groomed to be our striker.

We've tried Paulinho in the #10 role and it was OK. We kinda lost his B2B presence when Poch did that and the only time he tried that was during our EL qualifier. 

After Eriksen, Lamela, Chadli, and Paulinho, we don't have any #10s. We could recall Carrol, but I don't rate him as highly as those above or Holtby. Plus, his best work so far comes from a deep lying play-maker. So, Holtby was left as our back-up number 10. Bentaleb, though progressing well, seems to play better when next to Capoue or Stambouli. Holtby was always played as a B2B in the pre-season, so of course your going to get a sub-par performance. The dude runs all over the field and giving him defensive responsibilities as 50% of his task was a bad idea. We should have had him as Eriksen's understudy. He could have started our games, run the opposition dry with his stamina and creative passes to the front. Then when the timing is right, put in Eriksen to do his magic and change the game.

Skirt - walking was slightly restricted, as was, as you said, climbing steps. In fact the steps was a big challenge. Also bending down. 

For next time I will think about shortening the skirt and somehow facilitating bending - although the bending is not a ""must have"".

I think he had a greater role last year because we needed him as a CAM to step up behind Bony. He did well there, and now he's playing a bit out of position at CDM, and I think that hurts him. He's trying to find that magic and it just hasn't happened this year.

As a Spurs fan, I'm glad we kept him. As a Barca fan, that ex-gunner and the ancient french defender were wastes of money when you consider we won't be able to buy next summer window. But the Barca sub is one big-ol circle jerk. I mention the fact that Vermaelen lost his place in Arsenal, the team performed worse when he was in the back 4 (despite being the captain) and I get massive down votes for giving our players flack. With Real Madrid having spent another fortune and Atletico spent good money with all they got from Costa and Luis, Barca has to hope that Messi, Suarez, and Neymar can all share the spot light. As of right now, I'd argue that our back line is more sound on its best days than Barca's. A back line of Walker, Fazio, Vertonghen, and Rose is better than Alves, Pique, Mascherano, and Alba. Put Vermaelen next to Pique, and that back line becomes more porous. It's that midfield/forward line that protects the defenders, especially when Alves and Alba are essentially in the oppositions half most of the time and are terrible at defending. Add Pique's tendencies to switch off and the fact that Mascherano isn't a CB, and el Bleugrana are going to struggle against top opposition.

Vertonghen would have been a waaaay better purchase than Vermaelen. And as far as a back-up LB or better yet, someone to challenge Alba, Ricardo Rodriguez would have been a better purchase (they have the money, he is younger, faster, a better crosser, and a better defender than Mathieu.

In the early eighties there was a definite prevalence of people *(kids)* shifting their support towards the flavour of the day, winning team(s).  But there was also a lot more support for local teams, rather than almost wholly for a tiny number of big-name teams.

Rather than hate for popular teams, what there was was a definite sense of elitism from people who regarded themselves as **real** fans of particular teams.  This isn't so different to what you see with some people with music.  *""I liked it BEFORE it was cool!""*

The other thing that was different at this point was that football clubs used to invest a great deal of time and effort in finding and training kids with talent who would end up in their teams.  Tottenham Hotspur were particularly well known for this, when I was a kid.  The Hackney Marshes, long before they were decimated for the Olympics were a major recruiting ground.

This is all basically preamble which leads up to the point where Manchester United was floated on the stock exchange which brought in enough cash to just start buying players willy-nilly.  Manchester United garnered a lot of hate at that stage not so much because they were persistently popular, but because it was a consequence of just flinging money around.  Prior to this I don't have any recollection of any teams being universally disliked.  

Through success they scooped up all the fans who would support whoever was winning and that as much as buying success is what I recall generating revulsion.

We have to play to our strengths, and Rodgers is NOT doing that. What worked against Spurs? What worked against Swansea? We haven't won that many games this year, but the ones where we have won we've played two up top. Start Borini and Balotelli on top. 

Coutinho hasn't been playing well when he starts, he is a far better impact sub, same goes for Allen. Play Sterling behind Borini and Balotelli. Now for the midfield three, I haven't seen anything that says that Allen should start. We should play a midfield three of Henderson Lucas and Gerrard, with Henderson playing furthest up, Gerrard behind him, and Lucas as the defensive midfielder.

For defense we need to drop Johnson. Why are we playing him. Manquillo has been one of our best and most consistent players this season, I have no idea why he's not starting in almost every game. Other than that stick to the defense we have, Lovren Skrtel and Moreno on the right, because face it. We don't have anything else.

Tottenham, however, managed to attract big name players such as Lamela, Paulinho, Soldado (note: these were big names at the time) plus they also beat us to Willian (before Chelsea came in last minute). These are huge names - Lamela was one of the hottest prospects in Europe, Paulinho was a Brazilian NT player who was considered better than Fernandinho amongst others, Soldado was a consistent 20+ goals a season striker in one of the top two leagues in world football. Maybe the market was different but still, why were we unable to attract players of this status?

Does this mean That Tennant saved River song from this or does it mean he merely copied her?

The Mistress was so damn perfect. She went from some ambiguous face that popped up occasionally in episodes to my favorite villain ever in like the five minutes the rug was being pulled from underneath Capaldi's feet.

This episode had so many incredible moments. The whole scene with Clara throwing the keys into the lava had some of the best Capaldi moments to date.

false,rydleo,null,null,"Honestly not sure how much it can be fixed as we pretty well mucked up in the summer with respect to transfers.  For now I think BR has pseudo-fixed one thing and that's not splitting the CBs so far apart the last two games and holding back one of the fullbacks.

That said, he's also got it a bit wrong in my opinion as he pulled Johnson in as an auxiliary CB and I don't like that much.  For me, it should be one of the fullbacks back a bit deeper, not always the same one, depending on where the ball is being played.  Sometimes it may be Moreno, sometimes the RB, but not always the same one as that's very predictable.

Gerrrad/CDM should be a bit higher, which he was against Newcastle.  I like that and it was a good change.

The other midfielders need to have more freedom to go forward which they would if a stronger defender were holding, thus I'd play Lucas as he's our best CDM although I'd be okay with either Allen or Can there as well.

Sterling needs to have more freedom as well and should never be played wide right as it limits what he can do.  Left is okay as he can cut in and center works as well but he's poor on the right for me.

We need to practice winning the ball in the air in midfield as we suck at it.  Balotelli needs work on this as well.  This would help Mignolet as right now even if he wanted to kick it long he has no one to kick it to who can win a damn header anyway.

All of that said, for me against Real I'd play:

    Mignolet
    Manquillo Skrtel Lovren Moreno
    Lucas
    Henderson Can
    Lalllana
    Sterling Balotelli

I'd like to rest Sterling but frankly I think he'd be better suited than anyone else we have to try and run behind Real's CBs and pair with Balotelli.  I chose Can over Coutinho as I think we need some size/height in midfield and Lallana over Coutinho since he should be well rested and he's also pretty good at providing service and gliding past opposition players.

Gerrard and Coutinho can come in off the bench and have a massive impact offensively if we're struggling.

I'd think about Toure for Skrtel as well as I thought he and Lovren played pretty well together the other day but Skrtel and Lovren seem to be somewhat settling down a bit lately so for now I'd probably stick with it.

The only other thing is I'd tell the CBs (and everyone in general) when in doubt, clear the fucking ball.  Playing out of the back is nice if you have time, but safety should always be the priority.  

Also, none of this nonsense passing it around from CB to CB and FB to CB and then CB to CDM and then CDM to GK.  Move the ball forward quickly and, if/when we lose possession, I expect pressing everywhere.  Hunt in packs to win the ball back everywhere on the pitch.  Real may break though it easier than I'd like since they have insanely skilled players, but at least make them work for it rather than be able to stroll into our side of the pitch.",0,1414909042,null,0,false,0,clqm4zl,t3_2l1efg,t1_clqm4zl,t3_2l1efg,null,1426232626,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

* ""Do you think I care so little that betraying me would make a difference?"" 
* ""I'm exactly what you deserve.""
* As obvious as it is, I just love how different and compelling Capaldi's Doctor is. He cares the world about Clara through and back, even if it isn't outright visible. 
* ""Well, that's life. Well not really life but..."" Must be hard not to make death jokes in the Nethersphere to new ""clients.""
* Nethersphere looks absolutely gorgeous, and Wi-Fi, spotty but still. So I guess the afterlife will be cool after all. seems the complaints about Missy's Clara watching device are dead, iPad and Steve Jobs still making sales in the afterlife, figures.
* The Mausoleum was interesting, who knows if the world would actually adopt this design for the dead. CHAIRS! Exoskeletons! X-ray water! Edit: Little did I know...
* ""There's no immediate hurry. Browsin'."" 12 and Clara continue to play off each other so well.
* Missy gave the Doctor a different kind of nose job, yikes.
* What did Clara say between the Doctor's ""Very...realistic."" ""______"" ""Shut up.""
* Of course obligatory ""Doctor. Who?"" joke. Clara's face said it all.
* Sorry sorry, a sucker for Doctor and companion holding hands. It's cute, not relationship-y cute just like best bros cute. Brb gotta go punch a wall.
* Finally a glimpse of the ol' I'm a soldier Danny, but brutal about the meet up with the boy he killed. Punishing him for the act?
* All the swearing on the psychic paper, sup Malcolm Tucker.
* ""Speak of me again I'll detach something from you.""
* ""AAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!"" ""Welp, sounds like someone left their body to science.""
* The idea of studying tv white noise is random, but I guess it's the bridge to this army's success.
* So the cremation question was the last factor in whether the dead's physical body was used for the cybermen since it breaks the connection between the physical and mental worlds.
* Despite a lot of people predicting this early on, thanks to set pics and such, it was no less exciting, scary, and awesome to see the Cybermen army revealed!!
* Wow, didn't expect that blinky sphere to be the nethersphere(I'm stupid) just assumed it was a futuristic security camera not the mental/spiritual link to dead cybermen encased bodies.
* ""Upload the mind, upgrade the body."" Sign me up?
* Safe to say Danny's ""one-dimensionality"" faulted him in not being able to say a ""Danny thing"" to convince Clara about his legitimacy? 
* ""All the graves on planet Earth are about to give birth."" Bars.
* Started Who along with Clara, so it's my first time seeing THE MASTER, and a  female one at that!! Next week gon be cray cray. Fuckity bye!",0,1414914554,null,0,false,0,clqnepu,t3_2l0dq2,t1_clqnepu,t3_2l0dq2,null,1426232033,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Simply not true. Between the inception of the Premier League in 1992 and 2010 United spent a total of £415m, which is less than Liverpool (or Chelsea) spent over the same time period. And when you take into account the money brought in from player sales the stats show that United's average net spend over that time period is less than £8m a season, with Liverpool spending over £11m a season.

In essence - there was a lot more money leaving Anfield than Old Trafford and a lot less silverware coming in.

false,bakamonkey,null,null,"I was going to make a seperate post about it but was too depressed about the game. One of the big reasons we have been playing in such a static way the whole season with bad pressing is simply because of our running power as a team. 

If you look at all the best teams like Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Bayern, or even Madrid, all their players are work horses. Last year we had Suarez who kept harassing everyone the whole game, and the only non-runner we had to accommodate was Gerrard. 

However, this year since Studge's injury we have Gerrard, Balo, and occasionally Lambert or Lucas as our non-runners. The result is all our other players are either covering defensively for them or making runs they won't make.

So we don't get the pressing from last year nor the amazing runs and quick interplay we saw. The solution is pretty simply - we can only play with one of these players in a game. 

The problem is that this either means we need to play with Borini upfront or sacrifice Gerrard. Since defense is one of our main problems I think the formation should be - 

Mig, Moreno, Sakho, Skrtel, Manquillo, Can, Hendo, Coutinho, Lallana (or Borini), Sterling, Balo 

or

Mig, Moreno, Sakho, Skrtel, Manquillo, Gerrard, Hendo, Lallana, Coutinho, Sterling, Borini 

The 2nd formation works fine with Studge, but otherwise leaves us a problem in attack and the tendency to lose the midfield unless Lallana works overtime.

Anyway like has already been said, call your adviser and explain the situation. One thing I did learn is that most of the people you'll speak to genuinely do want to help you - yes there are targets, bonuses and the like but the vast majority of people who worked for us seemed to be doing it for the right reasons. They are human beings too and a lot of providers employ people from their own caseload - so you may well be dealing with someone who was in your position not too long ago!!

While it's true that sanctions aren't directly processed by the provider, it's pretty much an automated system with little manual review at the JCP/DWP end, so do not ignore the situation on the basis that someone other than your provider will be looking at it. 

So call and explain that although you are interested in the interview they set up, but you've had this opportunity that you feel has better long term prospects and would they be able to rearrange their interview. Also, you'd like their help if possible with some interview advice for this new opportunity - if they have any courses running before the interview, then you'd really like to attend one.

You're doing a few things by taking this approach - firstly, you're emphasising the long term prospects, this is important because this is how they get paid. I don't know how much you know about the WP but it's not a case of getting you a job and running away with a ton of cash. Dependent on your situation they won't see a penny for months and to be worth a decent sum of money you have to be in employment for years. If the adviser appreciates that this is a better prospect for long term employment, they're more likely to help.

Secondly, you're offering to attend their interview at another date, so you can prove cooperation - simply not turning up doesn't do this! You're asking for help with the new opportunity too, which will help the provider demonstrate their involvement - which they have to do in order to submit their claim to the DWP.

Hope this helps, it's a much more complicated system than most realise, be careful taking to the Internet for advice but the answer here seems to be pretty much common sense.

I don't think Brendan wants to play the diamond because it leaves us too open at the back, of course what he now must realise is that without the diamond we don't create enough. I thought defensively we were much better yesterday for at least 70'. So what he should do is scrap this defensive mindset, and start going for teams again. So what if the game is chaotic, at least that way we might register more than one shot on target. Stop passing it round the back mindlessly and take charge and step forward. The amount of backwards and sideways passes was embarrassing yesterday. The attacking players need to stop playing like individuals, I haven't seen anyone making secondary runs just to pull players out of positions to create space. That's how you break teams down like Newcastle and Hull who don't let you pass it into midfield. It's basics, stuff that was pure instinct last season. Stop wasting Sterling on the wing, he's miles more effective in the middle. Lastly remember that speech Stevie gave last season? ""We go to Norwich exactly the same"". We've become a team that only shows up for the big games, it doesn't look like any preparation went in yesterday's and the QPR games. Just because you've got Madrid midweek, doesn't mean you can completely neglect the league games. And he's completely neglected them, expected that just by showing up we'll win. Villa, Newcastle, QPR. Awful performances, where the players look like they had no game plan, no intensity and no will to win.

1) Check your socket, if you have a [TEST SOCKET](http://www.coolwebhome.co.uk/faceplate/) then connect the router to this (eliminates all your internal wiring causing issues) Log into the Router, check the Downstream Attenuation and note this

2) go to [Here](http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/max_speed_calc.php) and input the Attn (ignor the .x value, just use whole numbers)

3) Check the sync rate in the router matches the sync rate on Kitz (within 1-2 mb difference)

4) if the rates are 25% or more different, then speak to your ISP, tell them what you have found (attn shows Xrate but router is getting Y Rate, please investigate)

5) If the rates are acceptable then put the test socket back on and connect to your usual set up, then check the ATTN, is the rate different between the test socket and normal set up? if yes then your Internal Wiring is causing issues",0,1414921689,null,0,false,0,clqolhb,t3_2l1266,t1_clqolhb,t1_clqny4z,null,1426231479,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

false,SgtRL-3,null,null,"If you haven't got a credit card already then you won't need to worry about balance transfers and if you are able to pay them off every month you won't really need to worry about the APR. 

However, if you are planning to use them as flexible loans - even in an emergency -  be aware that the APR (interest rates) are frequently cripplingly high. In this event you will usually be far better off prearranging a higher overdraft limit or a straightforward loan from a bank. 

Credit cards have obvious downsides: 
- if you fail to pay them off in full you pay (a lot of) interest.
- if you fail to pay off the minimum payment your credit rating suffers.
- if you use more than your credit limit you will be charged. 
- if you haven't enough money in your current account to pay them off every month you may get overdraft charges from your current account, depending on how you have it set up. 

However there are some upsides:

1/ using them and paying them off improves your credit rating, which may save you money in the future with a better mortgage rate. 
2/ purchases over £100 have a level of protection through section 75 of the consumer credit act: http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/shopping/section75-protect-your-purchases
3/ credit cards often come with handy bonuses: I have one which gives me 1% cash back (though the credit limit is so low it's not really worth it) and one which doesn't charge me foreign exchange fees even for cash withdrawals (I travel a lot so this is really handy- from Halifax). 

In short, the proper way to use a credit card is only for purchases that you have the money to pay for anyway - as a general rule you should never really use a credit card to get credit (i.e. a loan).

I think Jose's comment is a bit harsh but I understand what he is trying to get out of it. I think there is a certain level of complaisance at the club right now: players, fans, the (poor) light guy alike.

This summer we did the business and, on the paper, we were meant to be very good. And it turns out that the magic is happening:

* Willian, Hazard, Oscar and Cesc have been creating great chances

* In the middle of the pitch, Matic has been **immense** every game.

* The defence, although quite leaky, is still very solid.

Because of all of this, fans come to the stadium expecting to see ""easy"" games against ""lesser ""clubs and tends to sit down and wait for goals. When the goals are not coming, the stadium (any stadium) will go less loud.

Other contributing factors: 3pm kick off games are not that sexy and are against teams that are not that interesting which create a certain level of lethargy as well. There is usually an early kick off game, which means people are in a pub or at home watching it and tends to come in late (regular match goers know the nightmare to enter in MH lower)

Finally: I have been lucky enough to be a ST holder for a while now and the atmosphere yesterday was clearly not the best or the worst I have experienced but I think fans understand when the team needs them and, yesterday, when QPR scored, the stadium woke up and started to cheer louder.",0,1414924264,null,0,false,0,clqp03k,t3_2kzs1a,t1_clqp03k,t3_2kzs1a,null,1426231290,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

It would have been a completely different ball park had Missy been revealed as a robot only then to be revealed as the Master next week.

Basically reveals can be whatever they want to be so long as they are done in the same television hour. It would be a copout to have Missy say I'm the Master, give us a week to revel in this revelation, and then say ""actually i'm the Rani"". The only way that it wouldn't be a cop out, is if instead of saying she was a robot, Missy said ""i'm the master"" then revealed at episodes end to be The Rani.

A tiny bit disappointed that Missy turns out to be the Master since a lot of people have been calling that just after her very first apperance. (As far as I followed it the big two theories were the Missy=Mistress=Master and the Missy= Miss C=Miss Clara).

However I kind of feel like the next episode will be very predictable, first the ""Conservation of Ninjutsu"" will take effect again since Doctor Who is incredibly guilty of it, meaning with each additional Cybermen the danger levels will sink even more.
I suspect Dannys ""love for Clara"" will allow him to ""rebel against the machine"" and take over a Cyberman body to control and help out.
And I assume that the Doctor will somehow use that gallifreyan harddrive to create some sort of technobabbly feedback loop to destroy all Cybermen with the flip of a switch...

Like... the Doctor uses Dannys love for Clara (since he's basically just data at the moment) and download that into all Cybermen via technobabble copypasta and all Cybermen shut down because they can't handle this amount of love. Sounds cheesy enough to come true...

And we'd either have to abandon the Champions League or just hope that our players could play two games a week at top level without burning out because we'd have no squad to rotate. 

Personally, I think Lallana is turning out to be the fairly mediocre buy I thought he would be. Everyone else - Lovren, Moreno, Manquillo, Markovic, Can, to an extent even Balotelli, is still young and with a good 6 or 7 seasons left at least at top level, and so needs the benefit of the doubt. I'd take Lucas as a great example of someone that most fans thought was a complete shit signing his first two seasons at the club, before he matured into a quality player.

We have pretty much the youngest starting XI of anyone in the Premier League at the moment, and on top of that we've got a ton of players who haven't played together all that long, a lot of which haven't even played in the Premier League more than 3 months yet. Give it some fucking time and stop overreacting and being a twat about it. If we've done anything wrong this summer, it's spending too much on young players in one go, rather than mixing in some players with experience at the top level. 

I'd also note than Man Utd, despite net spending that's over double ours, and despite the ""big"" signings like Herrera, Di Maria and Falcao, are still pretty much exactly the same place as us in the league.

Who didn't sing the entire game, btw, and [even their manager is giving them shit for it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29867892). When they scored the 2-1 goal they didn't even have the decency to mock us back. Arrogant, uninvolved 'fans'. 

Well, file this one under ""games we deserved more from"", right alongside Hull and Liverpool. If it had been *any* other team in the league, we'd have got a point or better from that game. There's been a lot of talk about whether it was a penalty or not, but I'm going to say that I think it was, if only because I'd like to continue to believe that David Luis's foul on Heidar in *that* game was a penalty as well. 

Dunne absolutely ate Costa alive the entire game, and Caulker looks far more confident at his side. Yun looked good, as always, but Isla gave the ball away cheaply a few times too many. Nevertheless that's the back-four we should persist with. In central midfield we were, unsurprisingly, second best, with Henry looking particularly out of his depth. We really could've benefited from having Barton that game. He's not afraid of a strong tackle and we could've used his ability to find open area on the pitch. 

Starting Hoilett was a mistake that I think Redknapp has to take responsibility for. Hoilett is good against teams that are the same quality or worse. But his one-dimensional run-at-the-defender game was never going to work against Ivanovic. Also he didn't track back nearly enough and against top opposition that's an unforgivable sin. Again, Zamora came on and we scored 2 minutes later. Coincidence? 

But, onwards. If we play like this we will surely give City problems. The fans were immense and will carry over that energy to the next game. We may not have got any points, but if nothing else, we've taken confidence and a sense of our own ability from that game.",0,1414927319,null,0,1414929786,0,clqphhj,t3_2l0ofc,t1_clqphhj,t3_2l0ofc,null,1426231064,9,false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,9

I'd actually say our main problem at the moment is that *everyone* in the first XI bar Gerrard, Johnson, and Skrtel is young (and even Skrtel is still under 30). We already have pretty much the youngest starting XI in the league right now. 

Our offensive options right now are Balotelli (24), Sterling (19), Coutinho (22), Suso (20), Borini (23), Markovic (20) and then Lallana (26) and old man Rickie (32). If Lallana and Lambert aren't on the pitch then we're relying on Balotelli as our calm, level-headed experienced leader on the front line, which says it all really. 

I don't really buy the ""more passion"" thing - I think it's a cop out coverall of ""There's no obvious reason why we're  suddenly shit so lets put it down to just not trying hard enough"".

I think he probably played his way into the starting 11 by looking so dangerous against Villa, but he probably would have been better as a late game sub here.

Chelsea do it very well with Costa upfront and the creative 3 (maybe Hazard, Willian, Oscar) of running in front of Costa. General penetration. From midfield, Can seems like the only midfielder that takes the ball on and makes penetrating runs down the middle, with the ball. Henderson does a lot off the ball but being played in the 2 with Gerrard limits that. 

Another thing that NEEDS to be done is getting the best out of Coutinho, on the ball he is the most skilled and he has the best vision after Gerrard on the squad. I think playing 4-3-3 he should play in the midfield like he did last season, we play a DM and 2 CMs, but Cout was further forward than Henderson and it helped him be creative. Making sure Sterling and Lallana run behind the defence (which they can do) and try and get him to play the passes. I would like for Coutinho to pass to Sterling as much as possible and when Studge comes back Cout to Studge as well. 

Defensively it's tough because whatever the tactic is seems to work but it's just down to individual errors, like Moreno yesterday.

That's a bit different to what I said, you said Rodgers was an average manager and the reason we got to second last season was because of SAS, so I listed average managers who could 'obviously' do the same if they were in charge.

Sacking a manager is 50% of the process. I'd love to see every person who proclaims rodgers should go at this ridiculous point in the season also put forward their choice of new manager.

Who in world football would want to follow Rodgers as liverpool manager at this stage, or any point before the summer. It would be his squad, his coaching methods and disheartened players who hoped to continue on from the high point of last year.

People will say he should have made better purchases or his tactics are currently not working. That may be true, but its very early to pass judgement. But I see no comments which point to a better option and very little about how to turn things around and make it work.

**Where did you purchase:** Home Bargains

**Product claims:** *""Our Brightening Eye Make-up Remover Pads are the perfect blend of gentle cleansers, skin loving ingredients and mango extract to remove even waterproof mascara and hydrate your delicate eye area. Perfect even for sensitive skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased to use as mini face wipes when away from home, and because I rate seven of the first eight ingredients.

**Your opinion:** I finally remembered to test these ... won't make that mistake again! Can remove waterproof mascara only with a fair bit of rubbing, the press and swipe method was ineffective perhaps because the pads are somewhat 'dry'. I switched to a regular cleanser.before my sensitive eyes got really sore.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, cetearyl isononanoate, mango fruit extract, ginger root extract, glycerin, bisabolol, panthenol, betaine, cyclopentasiloxane, pantolactone, 1-methylhydantoin-2-imide, ceteareth-20, cetearyl alcohol, glyceryl stearate, ceteareth-12, polysorbate 20, sodium citrate, citric acid, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, propylparaben, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1, 3-diol, benzoic acid.""*

false,CarpeDiem241,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt;First of all, there is a crazy amount of hate for the Armed Forces amongst certain communities in the UK, don't fool yourself otherwise, it's commonplace...

Public support for the armed forces scored a mean of 7.47 out of 10 [source](http://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/THE-ARMED-FORCES-SOCIETY.pdf) so your argument of ""crazy amount of hate"" seems exaggerated.

&gt; the fact that British Soldiers (in this case a Cadet but he was wearing MTP) can't walk down British streets without being attacked anymore should show you that beyond any doubt.

The maxim ought to be outrage at anyone walking down the streets who is attacked, not reserved to uniform.

&gt;Secondly, why on earth are you talking about the EDL, BF, UKIP, the Mail etc. after reading this article? Do you not give a shit about the kid that has been attacked? 

You are away of the date I assume, and the upcoming event? Not to mention the additional weight it carries being the centennial. The parties mentioned hijack events to promote their own, clear cut, agenda. Need I remind you of Rigby and the impact that had on local public opinion? 

&gt; Are you so removed from reality that all that matters to you is the wider political implications of groups and publications you disagree with may make hay out of it?

If I wasn't concerned about the winder implications I would not have made a statement on it, would I? It has nothing to do with removing oneself with the reality of anything, it's looking at it with a different perception.

&gt; My first response to this was how terrible it must've been for the Cadet, how insane it is that we can't wear uniform in our own country anymore, how we need to catch this idiot and how we need to do more to challenge the attitudes that lead to people thinking this sort of act is okay. 

That's your prerogative. And for the record that was my first thought, just not my written response. However on your final point of challenging attitudes

&gt; Your response is ""I hope nobody votes for UKIP!"". Pathetic, you're part of the problem.

That's exactly what I'm doing - Challenging a narrative of hijacking crime for an agenda of hate.

Chelsea and Man City pumped huge amount of money before Rodgers was even near this club. They spent that money to get to that level they are on now. But as they are so successful and rich the players prefer them before us. Bigger wages, more chance of success. We have to spend most of our money on players that we hope can lift us on another level. Suarez did that - it is the kind of buy we should be looking at when we are not in position to take a pick from the best bunch. 

Clubs have basically two possibilities to make it to the top - almost infinite resource, which we don't have, and the other is developing a team. The latter is more difficult as bigger clubs tend to pick away the best players from those clubs (for example Dortmund, Southampton). We are trying to do the latter but with more spending because our scouting and academy isn't as good as the two clubs mentioned have.

Spending stats lie quite a lot. City and Chelsea spent fuckton of money to get to where they are now.

Whenever a half term would come around you'd mysteriously lose one of the staff and would have to go back through the hiring process.

My favourite case was this lass we'd gotten in from a store in the next city across. The night went well, she asked if she could leave 10 minutes early to catch the bus so I said sure. The next morning I walk into work with the manager asking me where the £50 I took out the till went to. This lass had used my name on the tills to withdraw herself £50. We checked it up on the cameras just so the manager could verify it before going ape on her and sure enough, right before she asked to leave she dipped into the tills whilst I was out doing prep.

This arc has the Rani written all over it. And I think the newer fans are capable of dealing with characters from the older series.

If you think that the older fans only constitute 5% of the audience you are gravely mistaken, or you might be right in a couple of weeks if others react as I do.

&gt; Perhaps in one of the later seasons Moffat will decide to bring back one of the old Who characters, but it will not be done in this way. It will be given enough time to flesh out if it is going to be super important like Missy is

They had all season to flesh it out. And do you think they're going to reuse the same arc again only for it to be the Rani this time?

I'd rather go after the root of the problem, the EU,  than skirt around taking one company to court, which went bust and opened under a new name anyway. Better to fix the root of the problem than the resulting symptoms.

Our government signing up to EU Freedom of Movement policy, with no restrictions, caused it all. Employers took advantage of the legislation and new cheap work force. Yes they are arseholes but they didn't initiate the problem or break the law(apart from the H&amp;S part in my case). A bit like the bankers and the banking deregulation really.

false,PeeledApples,cnty-scotland,Still British,"Hmm. The reply they received when they queried whether the products were being produced to ethical standards:

&gt; ‘is a fully audited, socially and ethical compliant factory which has the following accreditations.
&gt; 
&gt; CMT is a world class multinational company, with manufacturing sites in Mauritius and regional offices in U.K., France &amp; Asia. It is a completely integrated textile mill and its ongoing success can largely be attributed to its innovative &amp; integrated approach. The vertical integration stems from production which has been transformed from spinning, knitting, coloration &amp; make up. Each of these operations are using the latest &amp; most modern state of the art equipment. All accessories, including sewing thread is being produced in-house.
&gt; 
&gt; CMT has Oekotex accreditation, which fully conforms to the highest standards in quality &amp; environmental policy, whilst having world class policies for sustainable development, social, ethical and environmental compliance. See below the various accolades that CMT prides itself of at the base of this mail
&gt; 
&gt; Whistles also has full SMETA sedex audits from CMT and there are no outstanding CAP reports to be closed off. 
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this allays any fears on social and ethical compliance from Mauritius. This unit is one we can be proud of in our supply chain. Hope this reassures you.’

Let's look at that text. What it tells us is,

* The company is very successful, and seems to be built on a strong, self-sustaining model. 

* The company (note, not the particular factory) holds an accreditation for high standards of quality and environmental policy. There's no mention of any independent audit to confirm that these policies actually translate into real-world activity.

* They've been audited by Sedex. This means they've been asked questions about their employees' contracts and working standards. There is no mention of them being scored. I'm struggling to find anything on Google to explain what a CAP report is in this context. 

I'm a massive cynic, of course, but I'm just not getting anything from this text that says that they actually treat their staff well.

During every third down, a giant bell goes off that can be felt across stadium and everyone just yells. It's utter chaos. You won't hear the person next to you if they don't yell. These third downs can happen almost 15 times a game for one team. My friend who plays on the football team says during really big games the rubber pellets that turf fields have jump during some chants.

The *entire* stadium gets involved in chants (not just certain sections of the stadium). Stadiums that double the size of the bridge.

What we did, however, was sign young unproven (at the top level) players who need time to adapt to the league/liverpool. 

This meant that the momentum we gained was completely lost and we are back were we were in 2012/2013 season, relying on a good end of season to salvage what we can.

You can't quantify that though. A certain type of something isn't accurate, and can be grossly exaggerated.

&gt;Nonsense, in your first post you said ""I hope this doesn't lead to him (people) stereotyping Asians"" then immediately went on to stereotype people politically opposed to you by lumping organisations like UKIP, the Daily Mail and the EDL into one group, thus labelling all of those people as evil.

I actually referred to him as an individual, not as ""people"".

Also included on my first point is the view that the actions of this one individual, to seemingly attack someone because of his association with the armed forces, inferring hatred because of the military actions in the UK, isn't a view shared by the very large majority of ethnic groups. 

I go on to say specific groups will use this to promote their own agenda, which they have done in the past.

And here's what the Oxford Dictionary definition of feminism is: ""The advocacy of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.""


So if you take a literal interpretation of what it is to be Islamic then that's pretty dangerous, I'm sure you'll agree, but if you take a literal interpretation of being a feminist then a feminist is harmless to everyone except those who oppose equal gender rights.



It would be incorrect to define Islam by it's most liberal and most inclusive voices because they are the extremists of that religion, they're the ones who stray the furthest from it's core definition.

false,iMADEthis2post,null,null,"It does indeed but the actual situation bears little resemblance to the gynocentric narrative, which for obvious reasons runs throughout feminism. It is fair to say it defines the ideology.

Myself I'm egalitarian because I care that 90% of the homeless are men, regardless of feminist advertisements asking for money to cater to the 10% of women who are homeless, I also care that men have no say over their reproductive rights, I give many fucks that male genital mutilation is legal.   I care that when society tries to organise support and awareness of mens issues feminists groups turn up to spit in their faces and call them rapists, *how dare they try to make their lives better*. I care that the number of female peadophiles and rapists has been supressed by the actions of militant feminists for decades. I care that when Erin Pizzey tried to follow up her excellent work with women's shelters to help the comparable amount of men trapped in violent relationships, feminist groups threatened her life, killed her pets and she needed police protection before going into hiding for a decade. I care that prominent feminists think that false allegations of rape are a good thing for men so they can feel oppression too. I care that far to much of feminism and it's followers can only be classified as a hate movement, by their rhetoric and their actions. Feminism doesn't give two fucks about any of these things.

Now happily, I think it's great to see more young people refusing to identify as feminist as they become more aware of what feminism actually is and just what the fuck it has been doing for the last 3 decades or more and they choose to identify as humanists or egalitarian like myself. Thank you social media for allowing this to happen, no longer can feminism control the public narrative because everyone can see it happening almost in real time, worldwide.

Feminism widens the gender divide more than it closes it. But hey it's great that more people are becoming aware of it and taking action, sadly this doesn't include the politicians wearing these shirts, if they actually had the slightest idea of what is going on in the world they would keep it hidden in their basement along with all their child porn and nazi memorabilia.

Now a lot of people like to pop in when I make a post like this and and call me some misogynistic woman beater or accuse me of some brand of idiocy or other or perhaps I'm living in some fantasy world. I will usually at this time point out that my SO is an academic feminist, or rather was, she identifies as post feminist now as she will not be associated with what feminism actually is, I will say though and I think this is really great myself, academia is crying out for a reworking of feminism, that's how bad the situation with it has become and my darling female unit is basically focusing on feminist counter theory and intelligent women are crying out for this. Hoth Sommers is a great example, basically ignored by feminism and loved by everyone else, she's a feminist with an actual education in economics, while a regular ""pleb"" feminist will be screaming about the pay gap, she will be pointing out that, there hasn't been notable pay discrimination since the 80's, while it is true that men as a whole earn more money than women it is largely because women want more flexible hours, more sociable working conditions and very few have the desire to do the dangerous jobs that pay high wages.

Now I don't know your position in regard to gender politics but I hope you have found this informative, if you or anyone else would like to know more you can fact check the vast majority of these bullet points on youtube, Hoff Sommers, Erin Pizzey (now associated with a voice for men btw) are all on there reciting half of this information, thunderfoot is great with humanist counter theory as is girlwriteswhat (highly recommended although my SO isn't a fan).

As I understand it the Kuznetzov NK-12M engines and their associated vibration actually makes them fairly easy to deal with for other navies. The vibration can be heard for miles by submarines giving them a decent chance to do something about it. Unless it's skimming the sea any competent navy should pick it up on radar. Apparently the US can track them via the underwater SOSUS network, originally meant to track submarines. This is a problem for all prop powered maritime patrol aircraft, only the Nimrod could get around it being the only jet powered MPA until the recent P-8.

&gt;it could demolish a large proportion of NATO's blue water navy. 

Only if failed to be dealt with before it got into cruise missile range and then the missiles not dealt with after fired. These days it wouldn't have the impact it might have had decades ago, even in the opening salvos of a major conflict. 

That being said, it is definitely rugged as are most things Russian. Given the majority of their forces will always be conscripts it pays to have machinery that doesn't require a PhD to maintain.

That peerage isn't fooling anyone; Cameron changed the rules so that he could award politically-motivated peerages when he gained power (note I do not say *elected* here) - and this is his sop to UKIP. There's a few other views about that nomination [here](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/antiimmigration-exdiplomat-sir-andrew-green-joins-house-of-lords-9808387.html) and [here](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/10/peerage-and-prejudice-why-migrationwatch-representative-lords-bad-news).

That has only recently started to change in western society in the last 100 years and there are still issues that are faced today thus the movement continues.

No-one is denying the issues you raise exist, far from it.  Everyone would agree that suicide and homelessness are issues that need to be tackled. (Though a lot of people will tell a woman to get over it when being harassed in the street, for example, or that ""she deserved it"" if she were raped, or that they obviously just need to work harder to receive promotion over a man) There are certainly many many charities and organisations the world over to combat things like the issues you raised.  If we were to be discussing gender inequality as a whole, then we would look at these things that appear to disproportionately affect men, but the topic in question is feminism specifically, and the disproportionately negative role and expectations of women.

Just a couple of points:

* The high % of workplace mortality will no doubt come down to the fact that it is largely men that do the more dangerous jobs in society, whether it be policing, fire fighting, manufacturing, armed services etc ... these were careers that women often weren't allowed to do, and are sometimes still discouraged to do. Though we do see more and more women in front line services and industrial roles, there is still a long way to go and feminism is about encouraging women into those roles as well as encouraging society to accept women in those roles. Whether that be raising awareness of workplace harassment of women by men in a male dominated work place or by giving support to families that choose to raise a child by granting maternity leave and pay and not locking women out of their careers for being the ones that have to give birth.

* Suicide rates and homelessness will come down to insufficient support (there are charities by little the Government provides), especially for things such as service men returning from the front line.  It's also true that the majority of people in our prisons are men, and suicide rates there are unbelievably high.  It could also be attributed to the expectation that men are to be strong providers and that in failing to do so, or just hitting rough financial times, feel they have failed their family or failed in life by not meeting the expectations placed upon them, take their own lives. That can be redressed by society completely changing it's attitude to women's role within society as well as how society views men.

This is what my MP wrote

&gt;Thank you for your recent email regarding recall of MPs.  I voted the way I did on the 27th October as Mr Goldsmith’s amendments are in my opinion floored for two reasons.  They could trigger recall on a matter of policy not just on the behaviour of an MP.  There are circumstances where you may believe that should be allowed, such as if an MP made a solemn promise at an election then reneged on it (such as the Lib Dem promise on tuition fees).  However, even in such cases one needs to be careful as clearly it was the failure of the coalition negotiations that were at fault rather than the failure of every Lib Dem MP.  That case may be right on the cusp and you might disagree, but if one were to take something like a policy position on a piece of government legislation then those with the deepest pockets would always be the winner which is substantially my second point.  Elections cost a lot of money both to the public purse and to political parties.  I draw your attention to the report in the Daily Telegraph reading the by-election triggered by David Davis in 2008 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/2274124/David-Davis-by-election-will-cost-taxpayers-200000.html
 
&gt;Mr Goldsmith comes from an extremely privileged background and his personal wealth was reported to be £300million when the media commented on his divorce.  He and people like him could easily finance the campaign in a constituency to bring down an MP who has done no wrong but simply holds another view on a policy matter.  You might say that you and the good people of Ellesmere Port &amp; Neston would never fall for that and that may be true, but money should not be allowed to be used in this way and neither should the public purse be under threat because of the costs of running the necessary referendum and subsequent by-election.
 
&gt;I want the recall Bill to succeed based upon the principles agreed by the party leaders and:

&gt;The final legislation should have an automatic trigger if an MP is convicted of a serious criminal act that results in imprisonment.  The definition of that needs thinking about carefully, should it, for example, include the arrest and conviction of someone protesting as a matter of conscience? I don’t think so.

&gt;There ought to be provision for Parliament to start the process if a breach of Parliamentary standards occurs determined just as the House today can penalise a member.
&gt;Finally, there ought to be provision for you as an elector to trigger the process.
 
&gt;The next point to determine is, what acts, other than criminal acts, should be included?  Personally I would have a wide definition here as not all constituencies are exactly the same in terms of the makeup of the population.  These are the general tests of what makes someone a fit and proper person to hold public office. I won’t try and list everything here but might include making remarks that, are not unlawful but go beyond common decency, but again a very hard list to compile.
 
&gt;Any trigger for such legislation can fall prey to my original fear, i.e. abuse by people with a bottomless purse but, in the circumstances that would justify the law being used, one could for example insist that all funding for it should be transparent, only come from within the constituency and be subject to spending limits.
 
&gt;I will continue to support the Bill within the principles I have described as it goes through the parliamentary process.  I have no axe to grind because as you know, I am stepping down having had the honour of being successful in 5 General Elections.  I hope therefore, you will accept that the position I have set out is not based upon a fear of my electorate, but reflecting my experience over the 22 years I have represented Ellesmere Port &amp; Neston.  During that time I have seen the best and the worst amongst my fellow MP’s and I accept that some thoughtful change is needed to give greater power to voters and indeed to Parliament to deal with those who have damaged Parliament and failed their constituents.
 
&gt;You have been misled if you think the actions of Parliament so far on this will not give constituents the power you are seeking. But I am not prepared to leave our democracy in the hands of a rich elite, such an action would be disastrous.

How have feminists been doing that? Seems to me at least some have been reinforcing gender roles of late.

For instance, while describing Paul Elam with gender-loaded insults such as 'douche' and 'impotent', one [recently stated](http://aattp.org/mens-rights-movement-sinks-to-a-sickening-new-low-by-stealing-from-domestic-abuse-charity/):

&gt; Physically, a man’s defining characteristics speak to the one, single job he was modified by nature to do. That’s his responsibility; that is the only right he needs to worry about. And that right…that job and that PRIVILEGE is

&gt; To protect and provide for women and children…or die trying.

Certainly not if you have to follow it half way around the world!  I mean, companies and individual importers do use local (say Chinese) agents to visit and inspect factories for quality/conditions (mostly the quality though, it has to be said); some even do their own visits if they have the resources.  However, local factories can be very wily about presenting one face to inspectors and another the rest of the time.  They can also be very difficult to do spot checks on, with lots of security, or have a model factory and then other real ones.  They can vet or monitor workers to make sure ""trouble-makers"" never get to speak to outsiders or to ensure the right things are said - workers are sometimes frightened, bullied or threatened into saying the right things.

There are a group of fans, including me, who never liked Rodgers. His tactics are predictable and he doesn't react well to adversity. His attitude is pompous from the picture of himself upon entering his house to his shiny teeth and leaving his wife for some hot young thing.

Last year I loved watching Liverpool as much as anyone, I won't deny that. However, the complete lack of defensive shape and movement left me doubting. Rodgers did not convince me last season - Suarez did, Henderson did, Sturridge did. What about sterling? So far, it seems that Sterling looked amazing because of the space created by the blinder of a season that Suarez and Henderson had. I think he has potential, but isn't there yet. Beyond that, the lack of interpersonal skills shown by the breakdown in communication between Rodgers and various players undermine the ""Rodgers is a great man manager"" narrative.

So, you can disagree with me. But, don't say I'm overreacting, because I've always disliked Rodgers.

Call me PC but 'mental' isn't really a very polite term to use as an insult these days. 

People compare the BNP, EDL, and Nazis to UKIP because, for all of them,

1. They're driven by charismatic leaders (and flounder without them)
2. They appeal to emotion (because their audience struggles to understand facts)
3. They have very clearly defined enemies (with no demonstrable basis for their animosity other than...)
4. They blame the 'other' for all their problems, real or perceived

equally, they appear to gain traction when

1. There's social and financial metastastis
2. There's an out-of-touch political class (this I will not deny)
3. Money disappears into the pockets of the elite

If you think 'National Socialists' have anything to do with 'socialism', then I have great news for you! You may be pleasantly surprised to discover spotted dick does not actually contain people named Richard or any part of the penis.

We had the benefit that for the first half of the season the majority of teams completely underestimated us and how well we could completely destroy teams in the first half hour of the game. And nearer the end of the season when teams were a bit more aware of our weaknesses, we had absolutely nothing else in stock to mix things up. 

We also had the benefit that Suarez was fit all season, and only missed a handful of games at the start through suspension (a bunch of games we never really looked particularly solid for the wins we got). Other than two months of Sturridge out, and Enrique and Agger being gone most of the season our squad was pretty much injury-free - something we'd never be able to guarantee every year.

I'm not saying that Rodgers has been perfect this season, by any means, but I'd say at least give the majority of new signings more than 10 league games to prove themselves. We're still in a far better position than we were when Rodgers took over, and we have a ton of players that are still comfortably in the ""wait and see"" category. 

Our first XI is weaker now, undoubtedly, but our squad as a whole is massively stronger. And a lot of the players we currently have in and around the first XI are really a solid three or four years away from realising their full potential. 

Maybe he's bought the wrong players and that's not working, but I think to say anything more than ""we're shit *right now*"" about the players we have is jumping the gun far too much. Playing how we are now after finishing 2nd is depressing, but I also don't see how anyone could have expected us to buy a ton of players who are so young, inexperienced and haven't played in the PL before, and not need at least a bit of time for things to gel. But if you don't invest in the squad and only spend on marquee signings then you're only ever going for band-aids rather than fixing the proper problem.

Yaya was terrible for 38 minutes. We were overrun in midfield, he was not doing any defending and couldn't track Rooney at all. If Smalling had stayed on the pitch I think we would have conceded before too long.  

After they were down to ten men, and moved fellaini into defence then he started to excel because he ha no defensive duties. 

This was most evident when he went to 10 and fernandinho played next to fernando. He was one of the few who was still playing well an didn't lose his head at the end. 

Having said that, surely it shows us the answer!? Play him at 10 in the 4231 - especially now Silva is injured. This also has the benefit that while he defends badly for one of the 2, for a 10 he does quite well. In defence it's more of a 433 which gives us that extra man in midfield and tightens it up.

Actually, their echo has never ceased: it is only because life is now growing more and more quiet round about me that I hear them afresh, like those convent bells which are so effectively drowned during the day by the noises of the streets that one would suppose them to have been stopped for ever, until they sound out again through the silent evening air.""",0,1414942649,null,0,false,0,clqtklt,t3_2kxbd4,t1_clqtklt,t1_clpxgyk,null,1426229090,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Certainly there's a very strong streak of traditionalism in English football (""[X team] needs two strikers!""), and I think it's particularly prevalent among the commentariat. I remember Jamie Redknapp complaining about how we sold ""good English lads like Steven Caulker"" and then went and bought ""a bunch of foreigners."" What it looks like in your comment is that Sherwood is coming from that perspective to critique fans for not being ""traditional"" enough, for not supporting English players. But, it's not like any foreign or exotic player automatically gets praise. See, for example, Paulinho.

At the same time, considering Pochetino's comments from the article, there is certainly also a big portion of supporters who do especially want to see English players. And, that's not really surprising, right? But, again, it's not like any English player gets a pass *just because* he's English. See, for example, Danny Rose, who gets a ridiculous amount of negativity thrown at him.

What it comes down to is that supporters want to see the players who are doing well. If that's an Englishman, then wonderful, people will be more excited for the national team; if it's a Brazilian or a Spaniard, then people will be make jokes about ""sunny Spain"" and so on.

But then what? We end up with the same issues in depth last season, except with the added kicker of Champions League football for the first half of the season. If we rely on two world-class players to win us games with an otherwise shit squad then we're only ever 2 injuries away from massive losing streaks.

Consistently spending all your money on 27-30 year old established talent just leaves you where United were last season and to an extent still are this season - with a bunch of stars nearing retirement trying to hold up a bunch of young players who aren't really good enough. They won a title by signing RVP and their fans were happy, but two years later they're far worse off for it.

The way I see it, Rodgers is moving more towards a class of 92 approach by trying to build a core of young players that can stay at the club and be at their top level for the best part of a decade. Which is probably going to be troublesome while things find their feet, but it's a far better long-term plan than trying to find a Suarez every few years to carry the rest of the team. 

Obviously the best thing would be to do what Man City did and buy a whole first XI of established talent to win the league, but we just don't have the money to do that. We can either buy young and develop, or we can buy one or two existing stars and hope things hold together - those are basically our only two options.

You started off with that, violence, rage and thugs. How do you expect anyone to respond to that?  Now you decided to calm down and respond reasonably, I'll reply. 

For starters Farage was a commodities broker, he dealt in the world trade of metals. He wasn't a banker. He was a Tory. When the party signed up to the Maastricht Treaty, he left the Tories, quit his lucrative job and joined UKIP. I'd say that's the actions of a man of principle. Of course I wasn't there and don't know the whole story but I've yet to find anything that proves otherwise.

false,pmastersavs,eng-Cambridgeshire,South Cambridgeshire,"Both the initial Bill and Goldsmith's amendments were poor pieces of legislation though. The initial proposals gave too much power to MPs, as they were the ones that had the ability to decide who and who isn't eligible to be suspended from the Commons and for how long, and combining this with a history of sticking up for their own provides little in the way of an effective form of public accountability. Furthermore, I would say that the requirements surrounding MP misconduct also set the bar too high - conviction and imprisonment doesn't help in cases of severe conflicts of interest, financial impropriety, neglect of duties, or abuse of office. 

Then you have Goldsmith's amendments, which superficially do seem like an improvement, and I suppose they are. However, they seem to be particularly open for abuse from well-off interest groups who want to remove particular MPs and fund campaigns in order to see this happen, or 'sore loser' elections where either a rich individual, or with significant help from Party HQ will effectively try to re-run narrowly lost elections until they win. Repeated electioneering, or the threat of it, can detract from the actual responsibilities of an MP and also applies severe financial pressure to them. Also, because of the proposed mechanism that this would take place using (5%, then 20%, then 50% required), MPs who have been imprisoned, for example, could take months to remove. These proposals simply make it hard to remove those who do deserve removing, and makes it easier to remove those who (probably) don't deserve it. 

If anyone else is interested in this (Saint) Julian Huppert MP wrote an article saying pretty much exactly what I said on his website, and also detailed his own recall plans, basically constituting an independent, third-party (named an electoral court) that can have cases for removal brought to it and arbitrated on in a legally-binding manner. Still quite premature in nature, but certainly seems more promising than the garbage that has been floating around in Parliament lately.

The primary motivation of Ukip voters is that they want CHANGE. They want to change our political system, because they are sick and tired of being told what to think, feel and vote by the LibLaBCon. They have had a close look at the EU, seen that the eurozone is terminally ill, that it has created massive unemployment and poverty, a lot of which has been attracted to our shores. It has been all over our media for the last 3 years that our immigration system is not fit for purpose, but only weeks ago has the shadow cabinet made a desperate attempt to assert that it would do something about it. Which frankly, it is very hard to believe.
Dave Cameron has repeatedly been to see Merkel, Hollande and Juncker, and he has been knocked back every time, humiliated even, most recently by Barroso, then Juncker. We  KNOW that there's not going to be any reform, that could not be clearer, so for Yvette Cooper to now start claiming Labour will achieve this is insulting our intelligence.

Send their granny to an old people's home?

Navas was excellent-- played really tough and his speed helped open things up quite a bit.  

Jovetic played well, I think.  He makes the ball stick when its knocked into him, unlike dzeko at times.  He was constantly looking to get involved and showed some quality with a few of his passes and his shot from distance, which I was really hoping would go in for the lad on his birthday!

Aguero is a fucking Phenom.  City are so lucky to have him and Silva, who keep in mind wasn't out there today.  So we beat the rags without arguably our most important player.

Danny getting hit. Didnt make sense, and it was too obvious that his death was just for the plot.

Its really annoying to see Doctor who is 2k years old super intellegent alien being as a slowpoke.

Ultimately the problem is girls choosing to go into poorly paid fields which remains an issue, but even that is being overpowered by the effect of a higher female enrolment rate in university which is leading to larger female earnings (as it should - that is fair).

I don't think men are being harmed as they aren't calling for wealth redistribution but I just think it is arguing over a problem which has largely been solved and simply persists as the vestiges of less enlightened times which will disappear as time goes on.

No but seriously, Moffat said The Master wasn't going to come back, of course, Mr. Moffat always lies. I love that the Master is a Time Lady now. It may have disproved an earlier post I made, but there hasn't been a Time Lady on the show since the classic series. I am kind of happy she didn't turn out to be a Time Lady from the classic series due to many fans starting with Doctor 9 and not having time to watch the classic series (including meh). But still, even though everybody kind of expected Missy being the Master, it was a huge shock to me and I am looking forward to seeing what Moffat will do with a female Master.

false,tittybangbang123,manchester,Manchester,"I'm pretty sure GCHQ have already proven we are in a kinda police state... police state is a strong implication though. It's more everything we do online/phone calls/texts can be monitored but it's not done in a way that would warrant the use of 'police state'. 

Also most countries in Europe have ID cards... driving license/passports... well especially passports are literally ID cards. Theresa May is probably the biggest wankshaft to ever get home secretary. You've seen the arrests for tweets and 'trolling' no doubt. All done in the name of bringing our old outdated laws up to the speed with the changing world of the internet. Snoopers charter thing was a load of bollocks and GCHQ will do it anyway, but the amount 'think of the children' shit I hear coming out of her mouth is far more than any labour government did. (Although labour did introduce the whole terrorism laws which have been abused to search people specifically of ethnic minorities despite plenty of evidence showing that people tend to use drugs just as much throughout races in the UK) 

I cba providing proof for it because all you do is type it into google and there will be plenty of journal articles on it. Think how many of the people you know have done/do drugs... I mean if you were to take the entire student population for a drug test (which is largely white) then you would stop and search them more... yet it's known that students do tend to do drugs... and yet the arrests don't show this. I've never been stopped and searched myself. There is differently something wrong with our police force (Most are lovely, a small few are cunts) if people who are black/brown are being arrested much more than white people statistically if, as the evidence shows (seriously, google it) we tend to take drugs at pretty much the same rate.There's something off about that to say the least.

But to answer your original question, (sorry went off there for a bit) yes the current system has a massive opportunity for abuse but the Tories speeded up the whole police state thing and the Lib Dems blocked it.

He's been given more money then he has possibly dreamed of when he started out being a manager. There are only 3 or so clubs in the Premier League with a worse defense than us, and he's spent 20 Mill on Lovren, 20 Mill on Sakho, 12 million on Moreno, 10 million on Mignolet and perhaps another 20 mill on a RB or give Johnson (fuck knows why) a new contract. Why Gerrard has to play all the time? Why does Markovic, signed for 20 Mill, not even make the bench?

Is Lovren an upgrade on Agger? Is Mignolet on Reina? Where is our Matic/Mascherano DM to help us to, you know, DEFEND?

Ask yourself this, how much influence did Suarez have last season? Were we just a 1 man team?

Brendan Rodgers on Tottenham: ""When you spend £100m, you should be winning the league.""

You can all downvote me, but deep down you know I am right. How many managers in the premier league would've spunked that much money up the wall? I know for a fact Rafa, if he was here, wouldn't have.

false,mr-strange,null,null,"&gt; I just don't see how anyone could disagree with most of their policies.

Freezing energy prices is the most stupid idea of all.

Climate change is the #1 problem that the world faces today. Even if you've had your head up your arse for the last twenty years and don't agree with that statement, the fact remains that the UK's electricity generating capacity has dipped dangerously low, and is set to keep dropping.

Labour *caused* that problem by failing to grasp the nettle and invest in proper, new power stations. (The current government also shares some of the blame, although to a lesser degree.) Now, not only is Labour blaming the generators, but they are advocating a policy that will exacerbate the problem still further. They will mandate a real-terms *cut* in prices, just when wholesale prices are rising and titanic amounts of investment are needed. Who's going to pay for new power stations? They aren't planning to nationalise the power industry - so it won't be them.

Another aspect of this policy's insanity is that their real-terms cut in prices will encourage people to use *more* electricity. Energy-saving investments will suddenly look less attractive, so demand will go *up* above the current expectation, creating an **even bigger** gap between supply and demand.

Anyone who can stand up and defend this ludicrous policy is a dangerous idiot. How do you expect me to take anything else he says seriously?

And I agree we've maybe gone a bit overboard and gotten too many players in one go, but then I feel with young talent there's a very narrow window where they're showing their potential but haven't quite become proper stars yet and doubled in price. There's nobody we've bought over the summer that I'd say looks complete garbage and a total waste of money - the exception would maybe be Balotelli but I think him being lumped up front on his own isn't helping that.

false,jacquelynjoy,null,null,"I totally understand your points, I'll just address a  few of them here:

1) We can't know this for sure until next episode, but I'm pretty sure it was a choice to not show much of Danny and Clara's relationship for plot reasons that will come to light. Even if it was only a stylistic choice, I could get it, because I think that Danny is like the rest of Clara's real life. She tells The Doctor multiple times that he's her hobby, and her life on earth comes first, but that's simply not true. Everything about her life with The Doctor is totally fucking up the rest of her life. 

2) Danny didn't want to tell Clara something ""only he would know"" because he wanted her to leave. He's afraid something will happen to her if she stays and tries to save him. I feel this was made pretty clear when she said, ""If you say that (""I love you"") again, I'll turn this off!"" And he says it, she turns off the radio, and he sits down and begins to cry. 

3) Danny is Clara's humanity. She loves him, she would have eventually chosen him, and now he's been ripped away. Though Clara's been slowly growing colder, I think that we saw how loathe she was to leave earth when she thought it would be the final time. She chose to stay with Danny and the kids, and save The Doctor, even though she for certain thought they were all going to die. (Maybe she thought The Doctor would figure out how to save them, but I certainly didn't get that feeling from her speech to him.)

Honestly, I can understand her falling in love after three months. I fell in love with my husband *so quickly* and when we broke up after about four months, I was totally devastated. I *knew* he was the one for me. I can take it to the next level in my imagination and think about how robbed I would have felt if he'd died. (Clearly we got back together and eventually got married.) And if Clara is pregnant like we're all speculating...can you even imagine the desperation she would feel?

I think we're going to find out something giant next week, though. That scene where she calls him and has all the post it notes...I think there's something more there. Her words were oddly foreboding, you know? ""You are the last person I'll ever say those words to."" I think something big is coming. 

Edit: I'm looking at another thread and people are pointing out that ""three months"" doesn't indicate how long she's been in a relationship with Danny. It indicates how long it's been since she told Danny she wouldn't travel with the Doctor, but in fact kept traveling with him. In fact, it's 2016 in the show so she's been dating him for well over a year. So that's not a ""three-months"" I love you. It's a, ""we've been together for awhile now, I want you to know I *really* love you, as in, I want to be with you forever"" kind of I love you.

If, as a player, you can't fire yourself up for a premier league game, you shouldn't put yourself forward to play. It's that simple. 

I can understand your frustration, but Pochettino isn't the right man to lambaste as a result.

Allen's best games were in his first 10 matches, as Suarez himself said. Since then he's either been completely devoid of confidence or just plain found out.

People talk about this stuff like ""balance"" and keeping possession but have you actually watched Allen play? The guy gets knocked off the ball like (frankly) the lightweight he is. His movement and ability to get the ball out of defense to attack is extremely limited, almost entirely because if he's put under any pressure whatsoever he just passes the ball back. That's been true of him even when we were playing well.

The fact of the matter is that in a CL side you shouldn't be carrying some players through. Allen offers very little. Allen is almost entirely surviving on the coattails of Rodgers original declarations about him being a Welsh Xavi. 

People buy that a guy like Allen is good because they buy into the notion that it's possible you might not see someone's ability but that they are somehow adding something vague like ""balance"" to the team. 

Allen is a miss at any price over 7 million pounds.

Also, if you decided someone was a hit simply based on idiots being willing to pay dumb money for a player than you're redefining what hit should be. It should be performance.

The naughty bike shop I got it from didn't tell me this and being naive at the time I took it as gravy. One £5 Xenon-hybrid bulb from eBay later and my light not only hurts to look at directly, but could probably vector in an aircraft to land from several miles away.

Clichy was fantastic today so I don't know why you're even mentioning kolarov, he was crap mid week and I'm glad he didn't start.

We didn't play 2 strikers, Jovetic was playing in behind aguero, basically playing as a CAM.

What do you mean both Navas and Toure? One's a RW and the others a ball playing mid. Navas was started because he helps with defending the wings, which we know United love to play down. And yaya was playing because he has some of the best vision and passing in the league, I'm fed up of people calling for him to attack more and to play as an attacking mid when that's just not what he is, he's the guy who sits behind the attacking line and distributes the ball. Yes he doesn't do the same as Fernandinho defensively but that's why we play fernando, someone to cover the defence better so yaya can have some of the defensive pressure taken off him and work his magic in making the right passes, and threading the right balls.

At no point did United look the better side, hart had one key save to make and that was about it. Demi ran the show defensively and only a couple of times did we look like we were panicking.

For the most part we were keeping the possession, yes it should have been a more convincing score line than it was, but we were the better team, deserved the 3 points, and were unlucky to not score more and at least have another penalty.

Rodgers and Co could take credit for Sturridge and Coutinho and they lived off that and still do. One thing I do think is suspect and deserves the occasional mention is that it doesn't seem Sturridge was wanted by Rodgers. We pursued Dempsey our first summer when Sturridge was offered to us.

I don't think Rodgers is honestly any good at finding talent. I also think his ability to get the most out of players is overstated. 

The man with the tactical plan isn't always the man best able to identify players for that plan, as crazy as that may seem. 

But returning to my point is that when you're winning you pay less attention to the failures. Rodgers, Ayre, and whoever else is involved in our transfer committee have not been able to find a proper balance between buying for the future and buying for now. A worthy point about a lot of the players that haven't come good as of yet is that they're young. But a worthy counter point is why are we buying only young players to replace a guy who was one of the best players in the world?

It's worth noting as well that just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  I think we're all guilty of assuming the little bubble we inhabit in our lives is how the rest of the world operates, when generally speaking we only associate with people we have stuff in common with, and only read and hear about situations that relate to us.  Feminism helps brings these issues to light.  I wouldn't call myself a feminist per se, (like with some of the issues you pointed out I'd like for us all to work on every issue that involve men and women) but I have plenty of friends that are and seeing the sorts of things they put out there really opens your eyes to it and I see the need for such movements.  Ditto with MRA to an extent, there are most definitely issues that affect men that ought to be raised.

Granted men are in general stronger, but not all these sorts of roles require strength, especially with modern tools.  I'm not suggesting we will ever have complete gender parity in every sector, some roles will be better suited to women than men, and visa verse, but generally speaking there is nothing stopping most women being a fire fighter, in the same way there is nothing stopping most men being nurses.  It's usually just the perception of who is suitable for what roles and who is expected to do what roles gets in the way.

false,circuitology,eng-kent,Kent,"There are lots of male feminists, it's not feminists vs. men. Male feminists are such because they've been told by other feminists that it's something they should be. The same goes for female feminists, except they stand to gain from it, so there's an extra incentive to call yourself a feminist if you're female. I guess this is why male feminists are the minority.

To keep it simple, can you maybe just tell me what you think feminists are doing to address the fact that young women are out-earning young men, and that women outnumber men in university? And to prevent just making a statement like you did before, maybe you could tell me who these feminists are?

I would suggest that the reason men aren't getting anywhere in solving these issues is because people wrongly believe that feminists are taking care of it. And the fact that feminism has such a strong hold in this country that any mention of men being at a disadvantage is usually met with cries of ""misogyny!"" that it's very difficult to get any points across.

The simple fact is, nobody cares if men are doing worse, they only care that women are doing better. Both men and women are guilty of this, because feminism is so engrained at this point that the general population just believe that it's good, that women deserve things because reasons, and don't take a look at the fact it ignores men entirely, unless women stand to gain.

Take parental leave as an example, as /u/alexgmcm rightly points out, this affects women too, which is why you *will* see prominent feminists talking about it. But they are talking about it because having the father looking after the child would allow women flexibility in work, and remove the possibility of discrimination in hiring (despite the fact this is illegal already and I suspect not done in 99.9999% of cases, and frankly if you think men aren't ever discriminated against in hiring, you are an idiot), *not* because it would allow men to spend time having a break from work, taking care of their new child, taking an equal parenting role as fathers. In short, it's not about the importance of fathers being allowed flexibility to take care of their children, it's about women being given flexibility to choose to work.

The point is, you will never, ever see a prominent feminist trying to do something for men's primary benefit. You will, however, see plenty of them trying to do things for women's benefit, no matter whether women are really disadvantaged or not. Equality? Not really.

false,Smokedmemories,null,null,"&gt;Despite not been given a single solid fact, other than vague 'facts' that were already known 3 years ago.

I never understood this. What 'facts' are you people looking for? The GDP of an independent Scotland 5 years down the line? The down-to-the-penny tax intake for north sea oil? I swear, there were so much 'facts' and 'certainties' being demanded by the unionists, stuff about an uncertain future, despite the fact that the future is uncertain anyway! The only certainty was either a) Scotland runs it's own affairs or b) we continue with the status quo. Other than that its all guesswork, UK or independence. So the questions were do we have what it takes; does the status quo work? 

You mentioned 3 years and I'll tell you - in 3 years, despite the most crushingly and thoroughly dishonest, and negative political campaign in British history - I am still convinced that we have what it takes to run our own affairs. I have yet to hear the *facts* that show Scotland is a basket case that would just fall apart without our benevolent London overlords.

In fact, as the decades roll on and our welfare state continues to evaporate, and as we hark at the dystopian levels of inequality and poverty in our resource rich country, then the burden of proof shifts on to the British nationalists. It becomes their responsibility to give us the facts. Give us the facts that show this is the best anyone can ever do for Scotland, that anything remotely resembling local social democracy is a pipe dream, that our taxes must prop up obscene weapons of mass destruction AND YET through austerity the fabric of society must be dismantled. And as they make that case again with the use of fear, and of manipulation, and of spin and smear, our people will realize the one fact that really matters - Scotland's future should be in Scotland's hands. 

&gt;[Citation needed].

All the proof you need is in Better Together's strategy. In almost every soundbite, speech, public event &amp; debate, the unionist would tell us about *'the best of both worlds'*, *'a strong Scottish parliament in the UK'*, '*a no vote is not a vote for no change*'. Most polling data shows around 2/3rds support for devo max in Scotland, and has done so for a long time. So of course plenty yes-leaning devo-maxers swung to no at the end when Better Together was using language like 'as close to federalism as is practical'. Even without the soft devo-max no voters, if 45 percent of your population wanted something as radical as independence, then the parent (UK) government *has to* get its fucking finger out. Maybe down south you've all resigned yourselves to the fact that you can't trust the gov for anything, but in case you didn't notice we've had quite enough of it up here.

&gt;In what way? The government is planning on giving Scotland power over taxes, but the subsidies given by England will be either cancelled or reduced to very small amounts.

You actually believe the old 'we subsidize the Scots' myth. It was enough to make me give up on you but I've already typed all this so I might as well keep going. This has been gone over so many times it's unbelievable. A simple google of the term 'subsidy myth' should do it. We have our cake but it is eaten by the south of England on things like HS2 which provide no economic benefit to our country.

Anyway, they want to give responsibility to Holyrood to raise taxes, but still control the block grant. So when they cut the grant, it's whoever is in power in Holyrood (most likely SNP) who have to raise taxes, making them unpopular and so on.

&gt;So you think it is fair that Scottish MPs can vote in laws that only impact England?

No I don't. Nor do the SNP for that matter, whose MPs don't vote on English only matters out of principle. But you have to be aware that it's pretty difficult to distinguish laws that only impact England because Barnett consequentials can creep up in unexpected ways. 

&gt;Awww Boo Hoo. Cry me a river, Diddums.

He slows the game down way too much and at the moment we need to be doing the exact opposite. He also isn't nearly as strong as people make out and is terrible at helping out the defence and breaking up play. Every so often you get a game where a team gives him tonnes of room and he actually produces something, but those are few and far between.

The fact of the matter is that if we want to compete for the league and in Europe, we need better players than Allen. If you look at the top teams. They have players like Fernandinho, Matic, Kroos, Busquets, Lake in Allen's position. Is Allen anywhere near the calibre of these players? Is he ever going to be? I highly doubt it.

As you've said we're in transition, so why are we building for the future when our present isn't stable at all? Getting players like Lallana who are at their peak should've been the main focus this season as to give us the best chance of top four, rather than the best young talents in the world. 

I don't know whether it's the board, the transfer committee or Rodgers himself who is so fixated upon the direction of our transfer policy being one of signing youth with high potential rather than shorter term options who can better ensure stability.

* Stambouli needs to be given a run out. Capoue always struggles against quick midfields. He's much better suited against teams like Stoke and what have you - but against teams like Arsenal, Man City and Liverpool he's always out of place and always out-done by quick moves.

* Bench Ade. Let Kane start for the next 5 games. Ade offered next to nothing up front and scuffed two chances, a one on one included.

* Why is there no urgency in the team? It's been the same since AVB's time. Every time we're behind, we just look lost. With Harry we always used to run up the field, bombard the box with balls and get a result. What happened there?

Capoue had a real stinker of a game, slow and out of position most of the time and VERY argumentative instead of proactive. Mason had an OK game he made some decent passes first half but started throwing away ball after ball after ball. 

Eriksen was one of the better players first half and I was surprised he was sub, his replacement Lamela was left completly alone to deal with 3 villa players, he has had bad games recently but today I just felt bad for him, nobody even tried to help him.

Chadli is the only spurs player with confidence right now and it shows, how anyone wants to bench him is beyond me. 
Soldado needs to be on the pitch, he won't score goals but he is the ONLY player in spurs that knows how to hold up and pass a ball right now, he should have had two assists today and I'm seriously starting to get the feeling we should just put him further down in the pitch in Lamelas role and let him feed the Harrykane.

Harry Kane had a good sub, lucky he got a goal but created more chances on goal than Adebayor has all season, good on you Harry.

4. What the fuck is Capoue doing. 

5. Mason needs to discipline his game. 

6. This team needs to develop a sense if urgency. When we get the ball in our third, ade/kane/soldado, Lamela and Chadli need to have started their runs towards the other goal for a big Counter attack. No more of this pass it back and forth between Kaboul and Vert.

false,Paw_In_My_Face,null,null,"I thought Kaboul was fine today...cleared lots of crosses, and Benteke is no easy person to deal with. If you look at the goal again I thought Capoue was mostly to blame, he just idling in space and I understand trying to intercept the cross but he kind of in no mans land. 

In fact, I think lots of our defensive struggles come from bad pressing by the midfield. So many time Chadli will be idling in space when clearly the only way for Villa to swing it is to the wing, but he always waits for them to do that and then runs over after the pass has been made. I think Eriksen and even Capoue struggle from the same thing. I am not expecting flawless pressing but I think that is still very much getting worked out. Players need to press as a unit or else it can very easily fall apart, which is what I think happens. I really can't think of many moments Kaboul fucked up, aside from one missed header and a shitty clearance. 

I thought Naughton was back to his mediocre attacking self, putting in some shitty crosses. Width is still such an issue and I don't see how thats fixed. Danny Rose provides much needed width and he put in a couple good crosses and some bad ones but I thought it was good from him, except it pisses me off so much how he needlessly will push players in the back. 

Overall, I didn't think the game was so bad. For some reason at the start of the 2nd half we looked so flat. In the 1st half I thought we were doing quite well creating chances. It was a sweet relief to see us get a breakaway even if we did not score, cause I swear we just never get them these days. I don't see how you can say we are a team waiting to lose. Villa did not have many chances in the 2nd half. 

We're not playing well, sure, but enough of this serious trouble bullshit. This is the same team that has been playing all season and pretty much last season. It is what it is, hopefully it improves but until then, its just the state of the team. And to call that state dreadful is absurd. It was not a pretty game, but damn I enjoyed the first half quite a bit, it was exciting and fast pace. 2nd half was not as enjoyable but still man, its our team and I get that is why its so frustrating to see them not play to their potential. But to be honest, we do not know what that potential is, or if it is even so much greater than the level we are at now. 

For now though, we just have to accept the team for what it is. This shouldn't be a knee jerk reaction because it shouldn't be anything new. I am not saying to be pessimistic because I am not, but I don't understand why so many fans come into these games expecting to see team play that has only been seen against shitty Europa teams and championship squads (QPR is included in the latter ;). I hope it gets better, and I do think it will (see I do have optimism) but all I am saying is until that point, just accept our lot....and try not to shit on players who simply are not playing that badly.

I don't know what you think we do as recruiters, but its not CV sorting and passing on. Sure there an element of filtering and sorting, but the real worth is once we get people who's CV's match up. Nobody is 100% , with anything over 75% match I can work with no real issues, tweak a few CV points, highlight experiences, and then you can get to an interview and prove your worth. 

You might cock up in the interview though, your CV might not fit in that top bracket. We may be going for a promotion, which in my sector companies don't generally come to agencies to give somebody a step up, they have people of their own to promote.  I have clients who we can sort stuff like that. You cock up in an interview, we can call and say look I really like this guy, can we arrange another interview with another person in the business.

I don't think the average feminist takes glee at the fact that many fathers cannot raise their children as much as they would like, or that so many men unfairly lose out in divorce courts. Most people just want equality.

I think it's key to separate out the normal reasonable feminist from the extremist SJW types you find on the internet and left-wing University campuses.

To that effect, since nobody technically would own the address or infrastructure, it would be down to the government to roll it out, while the Royal Mail would be in charge of services over it, administration and maintenance. i.e being in charge of mail delivery as they already are.

The upside to such a system is that if you move, you don't actually disappear. Currently, you need to talk to RM staff and get mail redirected, which costs money. With such a computer-based system, you could first pair yourself up at a new location and then tell it your old address and automagically have your mail redirected.

false,MrSqueegee95,lfc68,,"The problem for me is that we look too cautious, it's like we don't want to give the ball away just incase they attack and score. This is obviously a confidence issue and can be fixed with a few good results, but that's also a catch because to actually win the games to get confidence you have to play well. So hopefully Rodgers can start talking to the players and get back some of the confidence we are missing.

Another problem we have is Mario, now before you all jump down my throat it's not really Mario's fault. It looks to me like he doesn't fit our system at all, our system revolves around selflessly chasing after every ball, running in behind and giving it everything for 90 minutes (aka Suarez and to a lesser degree Sturridge). But Mario doesn't really seem to fit because he likes the ball to feet so he can turn and shoot. With a player like Borini next to him he obviously has an easier time of it, but that also means we miss out on a midfielder and we are more prone to conceding goals. A defensive midfield in January who reads the game and can just sit is a must, but until then we need a different solution.

My solution for the next game would be to play [this:](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=56fy6) I know a lot of people have been calling for this lineup and I agree. I think it's the only way we are going to see the best out of Balotelli, when Sturridge comes back I would rather us play one upfront in Sturridge and then get Coutinho into the team aswell. This is because he has good workrate and adds a spark of creativity which we miss a lot of the time, and I also think we would improve a lot defensively. This may sound harsh on Mario but I think with Sturridge in the team I don't think we will struggle to score goals anyway. And besides depending on the game Mario can still be introduced but we can just swap the formation I linked above with Sturridge coming in for Borini.",0,1414954205,null,0,1414954391,0,clqyjyk,t3_2l2z7k,t1_clqyjyk,t3_2l2z7k,null,1426226692,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9
false,aaronhere,null,null,"That's a great question, and one that I think escapes simple fixes.  A few ideas would be:

1. If Rodgers insists on playing a single striker (and from what I have seen out of our 4-3-3 it is essentially a single striker system) I think Gerrard/Lucas have to sit out.  A 4-2-3-1, for instance, *could* work but it relies on the 2 deeper midfielders being highly mobile and good ball-winners (by way of example, what other BPL team relies on a 2 or 3 man midfield that features a 34 year old?).  Hendo/Allen/Can could fill the double-pivot role.  This would leave an attacking-3 band of Sterling/Lallana/Cout/Gerrard (sub)/ Borini/Markovic and either a target-forward in Balo or an interchanging forward in Studge.
In the 4-3-3 we have been playing, it often looks like a 4-5-1 or a 3-6-1 as the forwards are pinned deep and provide little in the way of outlets and have of late been starved of service.  Additionally, dropping Gerrard between the CBs and sending the FBs up the pitch seems to leave an lot of room down the wings in the (somewhat inevitable) case that the ball is lost in the attacking third.      

2. Give up on the single-forward approach and stick with two up front.  Studge/Balo would be ideal, but I think either Borini or Sterling would add some needed pace and movement in the attacking third and free up spaces for both Balo to receive the ball and for midfield runners.  A diamond midfield could also accommodate Gerrard, Coutinho, Henderson, and Lallana, offering more creativity going forward and we could use our FBs in a slightly more defensive role.

1.  The system needs to change.  What worked last year - team pressing and wonderfully creative strikers who could create their own chances - is not viable this year.  Plan A has thus far been to give it to Gerrard see what happens, but Stewart Downing (!) provided a blueprint that has essentially gummed up the entire works.  Look at the passing charts from the last couple of games - we pass it around the back until someone gets closed down then we hoof it forward. If our entire offensive plan can be shut down by man-marking one player (and it appears that it can) then something is fundamentally wrong.  As we saw last game, providing Gerrard defensive cover (Allen, Hendo) leaves very little creativity to break out from the back.  On other other hand, providing offensive cover (Lallana, Coutinho) leaves the side looking awfully open at the back and on the counter.  How much is Rodgers willing to ""customize"" the team to fit an aging superstar?  Up to me, I would use Gerrard as super-sub in the attacking part of the pitch.

false,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Traditionally you win a war by raising a really big army, marching into the enemies capital and forcing them to accept your demands or by threatening to do that so that they give up without a fight. This is expensive in men and money and tends to backfire as the government which has been defeated and delegitimised tends to be less stable, less secure and weak. To solve this problem requires a nation building effort which takes trillions and decades of investment. This is unpopular with electorates which has made it relatively difficult for governments to get domestic backing for, despite a relatively effective track record (South Korea, Germany, Taiwan)

To overcome this we have a new strategy, we find some people on the ground who will do what we want or who aren't the person we dislike and who can act as a basic military force, back them up with air strikes and special forces, march them into the enemies capital and set them up as the new government. We lose much fewer men, it is a lot cheaper, and it is much easier to justify, meaning we do it more often. The problem being the new government is a lot weaker, has the ideological viewpoint of the original group, and tends to be dependent on western backing.

The key variable there is that domestic electorates tend to be ignorant, selfish, short termist mobs who know nothing about nation building, so they go for the cheap and 'easy' option.

[They are aged between 22 and 29](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/young-women-now-earn-more-than-men-2364675.html) - they have graduated and have better qualifications than the males who choose not to attend university.

I attended a poor state comprehensive (I am 23 myself) and I know that many of the males were simply not interested in education or bettering themselves at all. Whilst this was also true of many of the women most made it to University even if it was in less economically valuable subjects.

Ultimately people should stand and fall on their own merits, I feel no need to defend males who are not economically viable - in the modern globalised world the unskilled labourer is simply surplus to requirement. Likewise I feel no need to fight against a gender 'pay gap' which when does the correct statistical controls simply doesn't exist [[1]](http://www.payscale.com/gender-lifetime-earnings-gap) [[2]](http://www.learnliberty.org/videos/do-women-earn-less-than-men/) in most professions.

[The pay gap persists in some professions however,](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/upshot/the-pay-gap-is-because-of-gender-not-jobs.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=0) and this should be resolved.

Because to be honest if you pay less then there is less incentive for women to work in the field and it is in all of our interests for employers to choose the best person for the job, regardless of gender.

Well congrats, you just stumbled into a description of the creative process for just about anybody in any art form. All fictional stories use the same/ tropes plotlines, heroes, villains etc, from Greek Mythology to the Bible to Shakespeare to Dickens to Harry Potter to Doctor Who. All paintings need paint, and most all songs for the past 150 years rely on only a handful of chords and chord progressions. 
   
There is nothing wrong with borrowing from the past to try and make something new for the present. Now the extent of which he's been borrowing, that's debatable, but The Master has only appeared proper in like 5 of the last 100 episodes so I don't know how you're beating the ""too repetitive"" drum just yet.  

   
The same people that bitch about him recycling shit are the same people that would bitch if he introduced new stuff, they'd say he never paid enough credence to the past.

One of the local council estates near me is populated almost entirely by friendly old people, is kept clean, and is perfectly fine to walk through at night and spend time in generally.   The other one is populated by some poorer immigrants from the Middle East and chavs/thugs (near Paddington Station if anyone lives in London), and you are pretty much guaranteed to be harassed or catcalled if you go near there if you're female, and quite possibly assaulted or messed with if you're male.  Muggings are also pretty common.  A local head teacher got stabbed about 10 years back iirc.   The area around it is now rather dangerous, even though the surrounding area is extremely wealthy. 

So to be honest, I would probably wait a while and not bite this time.  Once you buy a home you're probably stuck there because moving costs a tonne and is a massive pain.   It sucks living near bad social housing (I lived near it in University in South London for a while), and being harassed, mugged, and just generally intimidated by thugs etc all the time really wears you down.  You'll also have higher chance of burglary, vehicle theft if you have a car, and so on.

Yes please!) and 13-year-old me has been waiting for Jenny to return since she blasted off at the end of ""The Doctor's Daughter.""

I want a companion who's just starting uni, it's their first time away from home and they're already nervous and terrified, and that's without all the aliens and time travel. They'd be a history major, because that could lead to all sorts of adventures and comedic bits (""Beth, what's your citation for ""Henry the VIII was in fact replaced by a hoard of cannibalistic nanobots midway through his reign?"" ""Uhm...well there was this really obscure text I found in the library...""). But the main thing about her is that she's ordinary, and never is anything more. She sees the universe, saves some planets, rubs elbows with famous historical figures, yeah, but she never becomes some saviour or a mystery for the Doctor to unravel, she's just a girl who does what she thinks is right, and by the end of it all, she sees that being ordinary just might be better than being something special. It's cool to travel the galaxies and visit the past and future sometimes, but it's really nice to come home from your first year of school, still unsure, still a little afraid, but wiser and braver, and give your mother a hug because god, it's been so long.

The last time we see him, the Master had been resurrected at Broadfell prison.

We didn't know at the time what all this meant for him. Did he survive this exertion? Was he then put to death? Did he still have the ability to regenerate or was blasting his life energy using it all up? It looked like he could refill himself on humans; did he ""eat"" some Gallifreyans?

Really? On localism

&gt; The bill was quickly undermined, however, after it was published on 13 December. One of the claims made for it is that it would ""give local communities real control over housing and planning decisions"", but on the same day, Pickles issued a decision in a planning appeal. The National Grid had applied to Tewkesbury Borough Council to build a gas plant just outside Tirley in Gloucestershire. The installation would occupy more than 16 acres and the application had been opposed by more than 1,000 residents in a sparsely populated rural area, by 12 parish councils and by every member of the planning committee of the local planning authority. Rejecting the local opposition, Pickles chose to grant permission to build the gas plant.[26]

&gt; By June 2014, Pickles intervened on 12 Windfarm projects rejected 10 of them against the recommendations from planning inspectors.,[27] rising to 50 rejections by October 2014.

On homes for key workers:

&gt; On 26 March 2009, Pickles appeared on the political debate programme Question Time in Newcastle upon Tyne. While discussing the controversy over Tony McNulty (who had recently admitted claiming expenses on a second home, occupied by his parents, only 8 miles away from his primary residence), Pickles admitted he claimed a second home allowance because he lived 37 miles from Westminster and needed to leave his constituency house in Brentwood at 5.30 am to get to Westminster for 9.30 am,[40][41] given that he tended to get home at midnight or 1 am, although the standard time for commuters from this region is usually ninety minutes.[42] He went on to say that it was ""no fun"" commuting into London from where he lived. 

&gt; In response to Pickles's comments that he ""had to be there [the House of Commons] on time"", Question Time host David Dimbleby, replied ""Like a job, in other words?"" prompting amusement amongst the audience. There were also remarks from the audience about nurses and firemen etc. having to commute across London and get to their jobs on time and having to do without a second home.

If you re-read my original post, you'll see that I specifically mention the Weeping Angels as a brilliant original creation and I second the opinion that River Song and the Silence were great additions in their first appearances. 

Finally, regarding ""5 of the last 100 episodes"", it will be seven when series 8 wraps up next week. Of those, there have a two-parter, a three-parter, and a two-parter, each as a series finale. That's almost 40% of series finales of NuWho. I think that counts as repetitive.

Because we live in the West, where most people understand Christianity isn't the ruling factor in most peoples lives, we don't put as much weight behind people being Christian, so don't blame their actions in religion.

If one was to go to one of the world's remaining wildernesses, say perhaps the cradle of mankind in the Rift Valley in Kenya, and deposit an adult, physically capable homo sapien, they would not be able to sit around all day and continue living without any effort.  **Staying alive requires active effort to procure the things you need to continue living**.  

Of course, we've moved on from everyone (or every tribe) having to fend for themselves by building an interconnected economy in which people provide millions of different services to each other, but the principle still stands that the basic ingredients necessary for human survival are neither unlimited, nor effortless to extract at any given time. 

No human is entitled to the right to have the fruits of the labour of others.  Others may, of their own free will, provide their labour (which is employment) to others in exchange for other things, but no government should take it away without permission.   The cultivation, extraction, and preparation of food requires the effort of humans.  *They*, not anyone else, can decide what and how to exchange their labour for anything else they might need.   This is the Libertarian position, and with the exception of some issues with property, it is very similar to Mutualism as an economic theory.  It has logical flaws (principally centred around the original 'theft', or acquisition of land), which is why I am not a radical Libertarian, but it is no less flawed than any other economic system, certainly not anything on the far left, in my own opinion.  

---

Secondly, I'm not sure about your other point.  Capitalism ""leaves people without unearned means dependent upon others who have access to them, and consequently at their mercy"" is certainly a valid statement, but it is one that is true in any economy or society.  Under a mutualist system, the mutual group/syndicate that ran the sugar factory would control the sugar supply.  The people who ran the tea plantation would control the tea supply.  

Giving the means of production back to the people would not eliminate selfishness or bad judgement, and certainly would not stop people being at the mercy of others unless every human was literally given the means of production of all the energy, food, shelter and other resources that they required, which isn't really feasible and certainly isn't efficient in a world of 7 billion humans.

Obviously when Sturridge first came to the club nobody imagined him playing the way he did, he was I think, meant to be a back up to Suarez.
He was of course so good, Rodgers had to find a way for both strikers to fit into the first 11 - which led to the diamond formation and the rest is history.
Now Suarez is gone though, I wouldn't be surprised if we hardly saw the diamond again.

I would try a 3-4-3. we have been having issues in central defence so I would try adding an additional cb and see how that works. 

I think sterling and coutinho and lallana are good enough to attack and defend on the wings. if cout can't do it then I would put him behind sturridge and ballotelli and move sterling out wide. 

I'm torn and gerrard because I think he is best in hendos role so I might drop gerrard and play lucas or allen and sub gerrard into basically every match at about 60 minutes.

I think a strike partnership or sturridge and ballotelli will be great when sturridge is back. for now I would play borini in his place or try sterling there and give markovich minutes out wide.

1.	If Rodgers insists on playing a single striker (and from what I have seen out of our 4-3-3 it is essentially a single striker system) I think Gerrard/Lucas have to sit out. A 4-2-3-1, for instance, could work but it relies on the 2 deeper midfielders being highly mobile and good ball-winners (by way of example, what other BPL team relies on a 2 or 3 man midfield that features a 34 year old?). Hendo/Allen/Can could fill the double-pivot role. This would leave an attacking-3 band of Sterling/Lallana/Cout/Gerrard/Borini/Markovic and either a target-forward in Balo or an interchanging forward in Studge. In the 4-3-3 we have been playing, it often looks like a 4-5-1 or a 3-6-1 as the forwards are pinned deep and provide little in the way of outlets and have of late been starved of service. Additionally, dropping Gerrard between the CBs and sending the FBs up the pitch seems to leave a bit of room down the wings in the (somewhat inevitable) case that the ball is lost in the attacking third. 
2.	Give up on the single-forward approach and stick with two up front. Studge/Balo would be ideal, but I think either Borini or Sterling would add some needed pace and movement in the attacking third and free up spaces for both Balo to receive the ball and for midfield runners. A diamond midfield could accommodate Gerrard, Coutinho, Henderson, and Lallana, offering more creativity going forward and we could use our FBs in a slightly more defensive role.
3.	The system needs to change. What worked last year - team pressing and wonderfully creative strikers who could create their own chances - is not viable this year. Plan A has thus far been to give it to Gerrard see what happens, but Stewart Downing (!) provided a blueprint that has essentially gummed up the entire works. Look at the passing charts from the last couple of games - we pass it around the back until someone gets closed down then we hoof it forward. If our entire offensive plan can be shut down by man-marking one player (and it appears that it can) then something is fundamentally wrong. As we saw last game, providing Gerrard defensive cover (Allen, Hendo) leaves very little creativity to break out from the back. On other other hand, providing offensive cover (Lallana, Coutinho) leaves the side looking awfully open at the back and on the counter. How much is Rodgers willing to ""customize"" the team to fit an aging superstar?

* The everyone-occupies-the-same-space-and-crowd-each-other-out  problem was especially bad today.  Even Soldado and Lamela, for all their alleged ""chemistry,"" were bumping into each other and taking the ball off of each other's feet.

* What's going on with Vertonghen?  Between him and Kaboul, I thought Vert was the weak link today.  At the beginning of the season, he looked good, but his past few PL games have been poor.  

* Townsend looked good today ... he made the right decisions, put in a couple of good crosses, used some actual trickery to good effect in setting up his bursts of pace.

* Our corners were much better today, especially when Lamela took them from the right side and thus had to kick in-swingers.  Also, he actually went far post for once -- and look what happened!  (To be fair, it is surprising that the ball actually reached Chadli's feet.)

* Mason was good today, but he needs to chill out with his long-range shots.  He's not as bad as Townsend was, but he still takes 1-2 per match.  

* As much as I don't like to see violence and anger-fueled aggression on the pitch (or anywhere), it was good to see some passion and brotherhood from the team as a whole.  Also, I think Kaboul did really well as captain in managing the several situations when shit went down, especially in his diplomacy with the ref.  Kane was also great in these moments, and I love Capoue's ""good-natured enforcer"" routine (reminds me of Sandro).

* HARRY fucking KANE. 'Nuff said.

false,circuitology,eng-kent,Kent,"From your 4th link:

&gt;“The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked particular hours,”

In other words, work more, get paid more. That's how the system works.

I think it would be better if working life were more flexible for everyone, both men and women. But as it stands, if women aren't willing to work as many hours as a man, or choose to instead contribute in other ways to the household, by taking care of children, etc. that is not a problem in my view, it's just simple economics.

If women were paid less per hour than men, in the same job, in the same location, with the same responsibilites, with the same education, etc. then yes, it would be an issue.

But the fact is, even your source says quite clearly that women choose to be less flexible and work fewer hours than men. - This is not coming from me, remember, it is from your link.

Personally, I think that women have the right idea - work/life balance is important. But not working as many hours means you shouldn't have as much compensation, or else it's unfair to those that do work more hours.

Look, I know they make some other points, which are better, but still flawed. But this is extremely telling, because the premise is that the pay is less for the same work, which is clearly at odds with that statement. The fact is, be more flexible, work more hours, and you widen the 'gap' even more - because overtime is paid at a higher rate than basic pay.

false,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"&gt;A club like Liverpool can attract the very best players

This is simply not true. It is a very hard pill to swallow, but we cannot attract the best players in the world anymore (if we ever could). They all want to go to clubs who can challenge to win the CL and that isn't us. Couple that with the fact that the top clubs in the world--Bayern, Real, Barca, Chelsea--all want to have world-class talent in every squad spot and clubs like Liverpool will only be able to attract the smaller percentage of players who are interested in playing most every game and winning trophies while actually contributing on the pitch.

I understand your complaint about getting in proven players, but BR seems to have tried to do that within the EPL. It's a good idea, if the players are actually top players and not inconsistent or overly hyped. For instance, I think Lallana has looked good so far, but not a £25 million player. But I think the prices that we are paying show how fierce the market for the second tier of players--the players who are good players but the very top clubs aren't interested in--is and how difficult that market is to get right.

As for how many of the players BR brought in were proven, I'd say most of them. Lovren and Lallana both had excellent full seasons, Markovic had been performing well for Partizan and Benfica, Lambert has a long career of consistently producing in England, and Balotelli is a lot of things (wildly inconsistent is one) but he is proven. Can, Manquillo, Moreno and Origi are all young and looking to make the step up. I think a distribution of over half of the players purchased having been proven versus a few others being young and looking like they can make the step up to consistent first team football in a top league is right. That's the market we're going to be focusing on. We simply can't buy players like Chelsea, City and United can.

false,TurbanCowboy,lfc68,,"&gt;  With a player like Borini next to him he obviously has an easier time of it, but that also means we miss out on a midfielder and we are more prone to conceding goals.


I respectfully disagree. I don't think it's as simple as saying that more attacking players = more prone or frail defensively. Just as attacking is the responsibility of the entire team and I think we've let down the likes of Mario in that department, defending is as well. Hell, in the days when Stoke were the most defensive team in the country they still managed to go with two up front. The idea there is that you have increased pressure on the opposition backline and as a result don't allow the team to build any momentum or possession, often trying to dispossess them in their half and transitioning quickly. It's also an effective form of attack - as was evidenced by the incredible number of times we caught teams on the break last season. 

Now I, personally, think Balotelli has shown that he's willing to work hard and press - but I understand if people disagree. It's arguable that whether he is willing to or not it just isn't his game. But I think by having a second striker you also decrease Balotelli's defensive workload - instead of having four defenders to press, he in turn has two. 

Our defensive issues, like are our attacking ones, are really fully team issues. Hell, we were one up front yesterday when we conceded IIRC, and if you can find it (I can't seem to find a clip, sorry) look at where the goal starts for Newcastle. All the way from their leftback position. They *completely* bypassed our midfield and were allowed to run at us without being challenged. Then it gets crossed in, not all that accurately, and we fail to put a boot through it and clear it out. It's just soft, easy stuff we give away. If it isn't a goal like that, it's a set-piece. 

The issues start from the back to the front, not the other way around, the way I see it. ",0,1414959387,null,0,false,0,clr1dvn,t3_2l2z7k,t1_clr1dvn,t1_clqyjyk,null,1426225372,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

There are issues all over the pitch and although I have a lot of faith in Poch he can't know his best team.  Kaboul is a weakness at the back and looking like a poor decision for captain.  Capoue gets caught out positionally too much for a defensive mid. Our most creative player Eriksen is looking lost this season and Adebayor just needs to be dropped. For me he upsets the balance of the team when going forward as he just wants to be able to go anywhere he wants. Dropping deep or moving out wide impacts our other players who are more gifted in those areas than he is. No surprise we looked better in attack when he went off - even before Villa went down to 10.

Still early days for everything to take shape properly for Poch but unfortunately he isn't afforded time to make it gel.

UH, and all of the accommodation is good enough. Admittedly, compared with some uni accommodation (girlfriend goes to Birmingham, so I'm comparing it with that), it isn't as flashy or new, but it does the job perfectly. 


Bristol for me was so great because of the city. Bristol is a amazing place to live, I've moved back home with my parents to save money for a year or two and I'm already itching to move back. 

As for law, I know you study in the Wills Memorial Building which is an incredible building, so that's a plus. Another great thing about Bristol for me was that there is no real ""campus"", as you'll find at other universities.

As for the student union, unfortunately I can't say say much about it. It's located away from the main bulk of the uni (5-10 min walk), and didn't feature in my uni life at all really. However it has undergone massive investment and renovation so it may well be more attractive to go to.

In short the trailer spoilt the cyberman reveal, but at least they kept Missy for a great cliff-hanger.

Only keeping the skeletions as the organic bit in your cyborgs seems a bit redunant if they've got steel exo-skeletions.

false,ianrush88,null,null,"About formations, tactics and personnel.

On tuesday we played an unusual formation that was a 4-2-3-1 on paper but ended up being closer to a 3-5-1-1 or 3-4-1-2 because of how deep Johnson played at left back and how high Manquillo on the right pushed up the pitch http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=56gx2. Our first half performance was really pretty damn good and Rodgers mentioned this after the game. What was very clear was that we moved the ball through the pitch better than any game this season, got in good positions in the final third of the pitch but were let down by the mythical ""final ball"" and in markovic's case a missed sitter. Coutinho although lacking that final ball was in possession a lot, with Lucas and Henderson picking him out in space for him to run at the swansea defence. We weren't reliant on fast breaks to create chances, we built the play with accurate mid-length passes, with most of the players having a good awareness of eachother's movement.

These tactics have some advantages: firstly the unpredictability - its one formation on paper so teams are ready to counter it, and then if they do counter it its possible to shift back to the more orthodox 4-2-3-1; secondly the three at the back allows for a more dynamic midfield as with the three men in defence there's less need for one midfield player to sit (even Lucas was making some runs forward); thirdly it covers for Johnson's lack of athleticism by making him concentrate on defending and not get caught up the pitch while the young fullback on the other side can run up and down all game; fourth with Manquillo providing the width on the right it lets Borini tuck in and get closer to Balotelli. On the other hand, with no support on his wing, Markovic has a pretty thankless task,mostly just getting the ball, drawing 2 men to him and then looking to lay it off.

Rodgers was clearly happy enough though to carry the formation through to the newcastle game but changing the personnel. What we lined up with was once again a 4-2-3-1 on paper https://twitter.com/JamesPearceEcho/status/528528685578878976 but on the pitch was again the 3 at the back http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=56g31, this time a mirror image of tuesday with the RB (Johnson) staying deep and the left back (Moreno) pushing right up the pitch. I can see why Rodgers used the formation - as well as the advantages above, it puts Skrtel in his best position as a deep CB, defending his zone and making clearances while Lovren is freer to step out and challenge for the ball in a 3 CB system. So in theory it helps the defence, and it helps Gerrard by relieving him of some defensive duties. However, again the isolated player on the wing, this time Sterling, is rather hung out to dry, and Henderson for Borini changes the dynamic. Henderson for all his many qualities is not a wide forward, not being good with his back to goal and much preferring to play with the pitch in front of him.

Despite the very similar tactics from liverpool, the two games turned out very differently. Instead of the passes cutting through the midfield, the ball was tapped slowly between the centre backs and central midfield and then eventually launched long, often for Sterling to compete for headers. Gerrard and Allen, rather than looking to pick out passes and then find space were slow and ponderous with Allen often losing possession with poor touches and Gerrard always looking for the long pass. Henderson lost the ball countless times in his left-sided position, eventually dropping deeper and central to where he was more comfortable, leaving Balotelli isolated. Coutinho wasn't getting on the ball on the move, allowing him to attack players, instead the slowness of our play meant everything was static when he received it. Even Moreno, the outright attacking wingback was much less effective than Manquillo had been in the same role. Of the attackers, only Balotelli stood out as an improvement over the midweek team. And of course Sterling (like Markovic midweek) was left with the thankless job all alone out wide.

So basically the same formation, except change the personnel and you get a very different game. I don't think the opposition was a big factor, and I think Swansea were actually better than Newcastle who for the most part were equally as terrible as we were. In midweek, everyone had a clear role and understood how they should be playing to get the most out of the team's strengths - even if their execution wasn't always correct. Yesterday different parts of the team were working against each other.

It's a bit hard to distinguish systemic problems from players simply playing poorly (Allen) but I do think the central midfield and their slow ball movement completely killed any chance of us using our attacking assets. Added to that, Rodgers selection of Sterling in that isolated role where he was never going to do any damage, and Henderson in the left-sided role, really should have been swapped, or Borini started instead.

So I do think the formation is actually pretty decent, but the newcastle match showed that in the end the personnel are the important thing. ",0,1414961886,null,0,false,0,clr2s8s,t3_2l2z7k,t1_clr2s8s,t3_2l2z7k,null,1426224719,48,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,48

false,iMADEthis2post,null,null,"I like your post and I share your sentiment, your last point though about men dropping support of feminism. That's not coming quickly. The common man sure, those in the public eye will not have an easy time of that, especially in the political sector, there is a very real fear about what feminism will do. Hate campaigns across social media, calls to boycott whatever you are associated with, calls for your dismissal. And ashamedly, quite often they get exactly what they want. Theres also a lot of money in feminism, it goes into the billions, I remember watching a documentary on where the money for things like breast cancer charities go. It's apparently no small sum that goes into political lobbying, I mean what the fuck? Your average feminist has no idea about any of that malarkey, but half of them haven't even read a feminist book, there are still many feminist communities whose only understanding of feminism is strong independent woman who is equal to a man, sure there are man haters but no one listens to them right? No, they are the people who stay with it and it's clear to see over time how the radical elements have twisted feminism to such an extent, they have been normalised and insane personal agendas have been come along for the ride. even decades ago prominent feminists were putting things into print, like it's a good thing for men to experience false allegations of rape and that mentality has clearly trickled down into society. Rape, peadophillia, domestic violence all crimes you must prove yourself innocent of rather than anyone prove you guilty of especially if you have a penis. If you have a penis, you can have the shit beaten out of you by your psychotically violent girlfriend or wife and when you call the police to protect you, you will more than likely be the one removed from the property, or even arrested and charged, you may even end up in court if you end up hurting her while defending yourself from a violent sexual assault and battery which is actually the pretty much the fucking nightmare I went through. She had been telling her friends if I ever broke up with her she would fuck me again, go to the police with my cum inside her and tell them I raped her. So, small mercies eh? They ended up with proof she lied about her injuries, she brought a friend who had no idea what was going to happen, saw her force her way into my house assault me, follow me to my bedroom, strip naked, demand to sleep with we and start on me before she legged it down stairs to leave the crazy fuck to me. Assault my genitals, try to blind me, didn't even interview her, the only person they took a statement from was the lodger who was so stoned he didn't even know where he was when it started, not the other two who saw and heard most and all of it, could have saved me 6 months of hell that, but as my barrister says, they don't just want convictions they want the right kind. CPS scumbags. A system gone insane. Stalked me after tried, to make me jealous by fucking a guy in a pub I was in in the middle of the day in summer. Admittedly that was amusing as she got bared for that but she continued to try to get others to harm me, made another big play maybe a year later, now that was sick, what she tried to do was not only fucking insane but the kind of shit people should go to jail for and stay there. I don't even have a restraining order against her I have no faith in the system, don't trust the police, reminded of this shit every time I see them, remember the way the WPCs looked at me, spoke to me, I actually feel something like shame or guilt every time I see a uniform, I can actually go white and feel nauseous. Social phobic anxiety totally out of control, fuck knows how much depression mixed in there. No strong emotions ever, if they start I may just actually just fall into a full on nervous breakdown and believe me typing out this shit alone has me on the edge of it.

This is the reality of feminists untapped influence on society, not only is it strongly routed it is often strangely intertwined in what feminists have us call the patriarchy. It's fucking bizarre to look at, it feels like a form of madness to comprehend. Only one can be the victim and only one can be the aggressor and these characteristics are defined by accident of birth.  And to to argue otherwise is beyond ridiculous. And while feminism has slightly moved on from rejecting all male victims of and even sometimes female victims of female offenders; domestic abuse, rape, peadophillia, you name it, it still will not allow an honest narrative with the statistical data collected from social investigation and would rather rely on things like the 1in4 rape statistics statistics where at least 3/4 of the women regarded as raped where told they were raped even though they consented to intercourse. known since the 90's to be insanely misleading but all feminists that broached this were ignored so they are still using them today, when they did try to update it recently they fucked that up too by making it voluntary and received a disproportionately large amount of victims who were much more likely to return the questionnaire. Too late, it's fact now for the next 20 fucking years. And the american president did that, he also recently went on about the pay gap, which was actually disproved in the 80's as personal choice, cultural differences and differing priorities, the employer is not the bad guy. All this is happening today and we have the cultural stereotypes that show that on some level many are aware of who is in control of the narrative. It could be decades before we truly start to fix this monstrosity.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Effort yes, but not a market price, and as the means of production become ever more sophisticated and productive, the required effort diminishes - but only if you own and control them.

The effort has diminished, as has the price.  A couple hundred years ago, around 90% of income went towards food.  Today it's less than 10% for most people.  And we provide basic food, shelter, and water to all the citizens that require it via benefits.  You don't need to work to survive in the UK in 2014.  Not at all.  It's not a nice life, but you won't die.  

As for your second point, it doesn't make sense.  The means of production became more sophisticated as a result of mass production, which required the end of an economy of subsistence farming (in which most people lived off small plots of land, owned their cows and plants, and had the 'means of production'), and a move to a different system.   Advocating the return of everyone owning their own individual means of production is ridiculous, it's the kind of arguments those far-right, anti-government homesteaders in America push.  In the 21st century,that would mean everyone would have to cultivate their own crops, raise their own meat/milk animals, have a power generation system in their home, and presumably also some kind of plastic factory to build materials for their 3D printer, which would probably have to be the size of a house to print the 30+ different materials required for the basics of modern civilized life.  That's madness, surely. 

And as for 'overproducing', people will always make what they want.   I'm suprised you advocate mutualism, which is a form of market socialism that would create an economy very similar to the capitalist one of today, with only a few major differences.

Ade gets the abuse from fans because he's ex gooner, if you look at his stats, 41 goal from 108 games is a pretty good return when you consider the role he plays in the team. But it's easy to put blame on him when things don't go well. Watching the game on tv doesn't do justice to the work he put in in most games. Yes, he can be lazy and look uninterested at times, but it's not as bad as people make it out because tv doesn't show his runs off the ball.

Soldado is such a tough subject to approach. He's everything we want in a striker, but he can't score if his family was kidnapped and held for ransom. In every other area though he excels. His vision, positioning, first touch, work rate, and passing are all on par if not above. Plus he cares. That is invaluable to fans and teammates alike and endears him to so many. He's a great role model for Kane and could be a great mentor for him. But goals are the currency of a striker and he needs to start putting them away.


Kane is the future and the future might be right around the corner. He looks like he could be our next academy kid turned club legend, but he need to avoid relying on him too much too early.

You might pretend to give a shit about human lives, but you really do not. Society is selective about the lives it wishes to save.

Which would draw more controversy and call to action in England? Twenty gun deaths or 20,000 alcohol deaths?",0,1414963897,null,0,false,0,clr3vey,t3_2kdlov,t1_clr3vey,t1_clkbq3h,null,1426224211,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Funny you mention this because 2 years ago, I feel that Oscar was the more important cog in the Brasil team. Back when he was wearing number 10, he was often the best performer of the team, despite Neymar commanding all the attention (which is understandable I guess). Things have changed a bit recently, and I believe some of the blame has to be put on the fact that Oscar has played basically year-round since 2012. The fact that he can still run around and cover every blade of grass every game is astounding to me.

Chelsea fans are funny with Oscar. He is a bit of a scapegoat at times, and is someone that people are quick to point out if he's not performing well. But then when he does something amazing like that goal yesterday everyone's back on the Oscar train. He's a subtle player, but if you watch closely he's very brilliant. He's just not a flashy playmaker type and doesn't rack up a lot of assists so people get frustrated and underrate him a bit in this age of FIFA type stats. But he's still young and he's a truly great talent, and he is the perfect piece for this Chelsea team (unlike Mata :/).

false,MaesterWeasel,null,null,"If that last bit was true we would not necessary need 4 senior strikers in the squad. That was Rodgers' target for the summer - end up with 4 strikers.

You're implying as if his philosophy cannot change. He used the possession football with Swansea because they had the players for it and it worked for them (promotion to the Premier League before a good season in the EPL). That doesn't mean that this is his philosohpy and it can't change. Imo it's always been technical attacking football. Media kept blabbing about tiki-taka when talking about Swansea or Liverpool at first but he really hasn't claimed that this is his philosophy. 

In the first half of his first season we didn't score enough and ended up changing the system. We didn't play diamond then but it was clear that we were more dangerous and direct with two attackers in the team. Suarez was then moved a bit behind Sturridge and everybody were praising Rodgers for his flexibility. That continued in the next year. Rodgers' philosophy and team evolved together and the best formation ended up being a diamond so we probably focused most on that formation and expected to play it in the future also. 

Without Sturridge and Suarez it doesn't seem to work - we don't see what's going on in the training. Maybe the other guys aren't very good together for the diamond to justify itself? Because it leaves the fullbacks vulnerable and the team generally lacks width. Sturridge and Suarez both could easily change positions and could do a job on the wing, so the diamond just worked. Currently, none of our strikers is perfect for that role. We're probably hoping to use Balotelli as a second striker behind Sturridge.

When the diamond was out of the question we had to find something different and the search continues. It's clearly not intentionally that slow and static football. That would be full on regression. 

So, I don't agree with that - the standard possession football is not the focus anymore. It hasn't been for almost two years soon. If we decide go back to it in the future then it's because we have the personel for that.

The scaremongering they promoted before the vote on gay marriage was pathetic - giving the impression the vote was in the balance, when it wasn't remotely.

In my case, it's nothing specific. It's lots of non-specific things.

Wearing a t-shirt suggests that this is optional. That not supporting equality is a perfectly valid political choice. 

It was all started by Elle magazine having a special ""feminist"" issue. So a magazine aimed exclusively at women feels that Feminism is not something that should be ingrained, but something that should only be mentioned once every few months.

Then there's the question of what the label means. Take for example domestic violence refuges. There are over 100 times as many for women as there are for men. How many feminists believe that some of those should be converted for the sake of equality?

- Make sure clean and lubricate your chain thoroughly and within Yamaha's intervals (every 750 miles I believe). 
- Clean the bike regularly, because if dirt is left on the fairings for too long, it attracts crap in the wet which can cause scratches. 
- For the love of God, don't put a stupid 'race' exhaust on it, it makes it sound like a lawnmower, and slows the bike down.

false,tusksrus,,Blairite | Join us on IRC! See the sidebar for details.,"With Jowell, Blunkett and Straw already announcing that they are stepping down - and if Jim Murphy wins the Scottish Labour leadership - will there even be any Blairites left in Labour next Parliament?

&gt;Speaking to the Financial Times, the senior Labour figure, who led the Better Together campaign in the Scottish referendum, revealed he was stepping down and spoke of how he was frustrated that Labour had not used that campaign to do better north of the border.

Can't help but feel the wording here implies he blames someone other than the leader of the campaign, a senior Labour figure.

&gt;In the interview, Darling also endorsed Jim Murphy to lead Scottish Labour. Murphy, who stepped down as Ed Miliband’s shadow development secretary on Sunday on Sunday, has two rivals: MSPs Neil Findlay and Sarah Boyack.

I wonder how wise it is for senior Westminster figures to endorse Westminster shadow cabinet ministers for leader of Scottish Labour. Alex Salmond was on the Marr show this morning:

&gt;When you get to leader number five, since 2007, there may be a moment to reflect.. that this might not be a question of the personality who's in place. It might be a question of the circumstances in which they find themselves. I'm not certain that is going to be addressed by the election of, not just a Westminster MP, but someone who has seen his entire political career in that format, and never has previously expressed the slightest interest in Scottish constitutional development. Except, of course, to try and stop it.

But Darling does seem to speak some wisdom here,

&gt;Turning [to] the possibility of an EU referendum, which Labour is resisting, Darling said he hoped to use his campaign experience in Scotland to help argue for Britain in Europe in a referendum. [...]

false,AluminumFalcon3,lfc12,,"I think one of the issues Rodgers is facing is how to play Raheem and Balotelli together. I think Balotelli has the highest ceiling amongst him, Lambert, and Borini, and so Rodgers would like to play him. Meanwhile Sterling is one of our most promising players and clearly also provides a great spark to the team. 

As you described, Sterling flourishes in a position in attacking midfield, but honestly to utilize him better I think he would be best further forward as a false 9. He can dribble, he has pace, he can score (but needs to work on that), and he has a good touch (but could also work on keeping the ball)--he would be excellent at dropping deep into midfield or running at the backline.

Balotelli, on the other hand I think, either plays well when he is supplied in the box, or prefers to be able to play off a strike partner. Unfortunately, I don't think he works as well as a forward playing with a false nine. We can't play Balo on the wings, and playing with wingers and Balotelli and Sterling deeper is much to crowded up front. Fact is Sterling and balotelli haven't developed much chemistry yet I think, and that's hindering our game. 

Meanwhile we can't play Balotelli and Sterling as 2 up front, largely because Sterling isn't as good as an out and out striker. And Balotelli up front with Sterling in behind him usually means Balotelli gets isolated because we can't utilize creativity on the wings. That's why I think Rodgers is trying Sterling wide and Balotelli up front.

Did the Prime Minister having a vagina in any way affect her character? Did Donna Noble's gender in any way affect her from being one of the best companions of all time? Was Martha Jones poorly written because she had a crush over the Doctor, even though Jack Harkness also had a crush on him?

Rose Tyler is dangerously close to being a Mary Sue, but stops just short of that definition. 

In fact, the only character from RTD's show that I legitimately think should not exist was Mickey. He was like this weird alpha-version of Rory, but with less dying and resurrecting.

Amy started out with the foundations of a character-----she was impulsive, wasn't averse to conflict, and loved her boyfriend/husband/etc.

But as the series progressed she became more and more of a b---h, and less of an actual person. 

And then when that dreadful River Song subplot became the focus of the story, her character was regressed even further into ""mother"".

I didn't, but that's a common belief amongst religious people. We have them in power desperately trying to pass laws or stop laws being passed that go against their religion.

&gt;And labelling people mentally ill is the sort of thing that used to happen to homosexuals. Replacing one form of persecution with another form of persecution is not befitting of our society.

True, the same could be said for a lot of things. But here's the difference:

Homosexuality is a natural variation in sexuality that occurs in a vast array of animals. It doesn't harm anyone, it doesn't cause harmful behaviour nor does it drive people to harm others. And can I not point out that that motivation behind homosexuality being declared an illness and crime was religious?

Religion however is not a part of the mind we can call normal human behavior. It's common, but it's not normal. Let's detach religion from the respect we are supposed to give it. If someone started performing ceremonies obsessively, talking to something that isn't there and that the person claims to be the creator, then starts to claim the creator hates random things like certain foods, material and people, sometimes acting violently towards those things, would you call that normal, healthy behavior?",0,1414966293,null,0,false,0,clr55t7,t3_2l2rp3,t1_clr55t7,t1_clr4bbf,null,1426223611,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

false,JobblesYeah,,KTT,"I think the South East was very interesting this year and it was really a lot closer than I've previously experienced.  
Within the top 5 there were at least 4 IMMENSE sudden death games showing just how tightly fought the top 5 positions were: 
 
5 v 4 : Kent vs Surrey where Kent took the lead after being 3-0 down before trading points, with Surrey ultimately clinching victory at 7-6

1 v 4 : Mohawks 1 vs Surrey where Mo took it at the buzzer after an endless last point ending at 5-4  

1 v 2 : Mohawks 1 vs Oxford where Mo managed the break the stride that Oxford had built up over the weekend to prevent them from steamrolling their new region  

2 v 3 : Oxford vs Surrey, game for Div 1, game of the tournament probably, where both teams played some insane, clinical offence with absolutely filthy layout grabs, with Oxford just coming out on top.  

Biggest rise in seed comes from also-new-to-the-region Oxford Brookes 1, moving from 14th to 9th and only just being held back from breaking into the top 8 by their friends in Oxford 2.  

Biggest fall in seed comes from Sussex 3, with a mirror of the above - an optimistic 9th to 14th, and yet still the highest ranked 3rd team in the region.  

Biggest single game upset also comes courtesy of Oxford Brookes, taking down half-their-seed Brighton in a Saturday 14v7 group game, a seed which Brighton managed to recover by the end of Sunday.  

I think that's all I can remember from the South East, all in all a pretty great weekend.

&gt;Under the House of Commons ""Authorised Records Disposal Practice, which is overseen by Mr Bercow’s committee, records of MPs’ expenses claims are destroyed after three years. The move is necessary to comply with data protection laws, a Commons spokesman said.

&gt;However, under that same set of guidelines, the pay, discipline and sickness records of Commons staff are kept until their 100th birthday. Health and safety records are kept for up to 40 years, while thousands of other classes of official documents on the day-to-day running of the House are stored indefinitely in the Parliamentary Archive.

The down-to-the-penny tax intake for north sea oil? I swear, there were so much 'facts' and 'certainties' being demanded by the unionists,

How about a solid plan not based on assumptions, hopes, wishes and wild guesswork?

&gt;You mentioned 3 years and I'll tell you - in 3 years, despite the most crushingly and thoroughly dishonest, and negative political campaign in British history

Dishonest? Hardly. Negative? No, its called being a realist.

The SNP's plan was built entirely on hopes and dreams, not solid fact or well structured planning. Essentially, the SNP were going to wing it and hope for the best had they won.

&gt;I am still convinced that we have what it takes to run our own affairs. 

Not with the SNP in charge you dont.

&gt;I have yet to hear the facts that show Scotland is a basket case that would just fall apart without our benevolent London overlords.

Heres one little fact: The SNP's plan was built almost entirely on 'Scottish' oil.

Here is another little fact: Had Scotland gone independent, they would have only had 2 of the 14+ refineries.

Here is an accurate predicted conclusion: Scotland would have lost a huge swath of its income. 

Why?

Because, despite the fact that only a small part of the Oil industry is based on Scotland, *ALL* of the revenue went to Scotland.

And secondly, as the oil industry is not state owned, the tax from such a small section of the oil industry would be far, far smaller than it is now.

This would essentially wipe out a huge swath of the SNP's predicted funding.

When these little nuggets of information came out, the SNP denounced it as negative but hurridly moved on to their other bird brained idea, which was to sell renewable-energy to England and the rest of Europe (which also wouldnt have worked).

&gt;n fact, as the decades roll on and our welfare state continues to evaporate

Scotland has the most generous welfare state in the UK. Roughly £2000+ extra is spent on a Scots person than and English person.

&gt;and as we hark at the dystopian levels of inequality and poverty in our resource rich country

The poverty and inequality are caused by problems which the Scottish government has control over. The SNP has been in power for...what? 15 years now? Blame the lack of progress on them.

&gt;that our taxes must prop up obscene weapons of mass destruction

Almost the entire budget for Trident comes from England. Try again.

&gt;ND YET through austerity the fabric of society must be dismantled.

Ah, look, a brainless lefty who thinks borrowing your way out of debt works.

Care to explain how Britain has the fastest growing economy in Europe? And one of the fastest growing economies in the G7?

&gt;And as they make that case again with the use of fear, and of manipulation, and of spin and smear,

All I saw were cold, hard facts. Realism. And then I saw the SNP and their brainless supporters sticming their fingers in their ears and going ""LA LA LA I CANT HEAR YOU! LA LA LA"".

&gt;Scotland's future should be in Scotland's hands. 

Go one and fuck off then.

Oh wait, you had your chance and you chose to stay.

Well then, shut up and put up.

&gt;All the proof you need is in Better Together's strategy

Provide a proper source, or else be written off as a quack.

&gt;You actually believe the old 'we subsidize the Scots' myth. 

Except it is not a myth. Ever heard of the Barnett formula? Or the huge subsidies the Oil Industry in Scotland gets, paid for by the English? Or the huge subsidies from the UK Government the Scottish renewable projects get?

No?

Ignorance is not bliss.

&gt;We have our cake but it is eaten by the south of England on things like HS2 which provide no economic benefit to our country.

Seems like you believe a huge number of myths as well, propagated by the SNP.

According to the ONS, Scotland gets back 99.7% of its entire revenue. the 0.3% left goes to Wales.

&gt;it's whoever is in power in Holyrood (most likely SNP) who have to raise taxes, making them unpopular and so on.

Wait....You want the Scottish government to have power over taxes one minute, and then in virtually the next fucking sentence you say pretty much the exact opposite because 'it would make the holyrood government unpopular'?

You should read Fidels spoken autobiography, seriously like, I think everything Cuba has done has been correct. It's strange reading about the Cuban Missile Crisis from the Cuban perspective (which the West is so hush-hush about), it basically says that Cuba received intel a few months before it kicked off saying that the US was preparing for a full scale invasion (this was post Bay of Pigs, so entirely plausible) - in response they allowed defensive deterrent weapons like AA guns and Russian tactical nukes on Cuba.

This is because immigration remains one of the largest concerns among British voters, yet UKIP is the only party that can actually limit the absurd system of mass immigration we currently have. 

David Cameron spoke a great deal about Labour's deliberate mass migration policy, and helped expose how it was designed to try and strengthen their voter base. He then spoke a great deal about how undemocratic it was to sign the Lisbon treaty without putting it to the people in a referendum.

However, Mr Cameron will now use an EU referendum to try and win a second election rather than having delivered it to the British people when he was elected. He will then campaign for us to remain in the European Union, thus doing very little to try and ease the levels of immigration into this country.

Neither Ed Miliband nor David Cameron are capable of challenging UKIP on this very important issue. 

&gt;Leaving the EU and returning to the days of Rule Britannia is nothing more than a dangerous delusion peddled by the politically unscrupulous.

It's not about ruling the waves, it's about ruling our own country through the politicians that we elect.

Doctor Who is uniquely positioned as it has a lead character who is defined very broadly (eccentric, pacifist, genius, etc..) and has been played by a ton of different actors, all with their own interpretations. None of these consistent traits for the character are inherently masculine. 

Stating that the show has always had a male lead is not an argument that works with me. Eventually casting a woman makes artistic sense, the format of the show allows for it, and there's really nothing inherently male about The Doctor aside from the fact men have played the role. 

The decision to cast a man *is just as political* as the decision to cast a woman. And it is a sexist decision because there's no *artistic* reason for it aside from ""we've always done it."" It's the same kind of decision-making that ensures that new shows as they come up are dominated by male leads, instead of female ones.  

Also, the fact you're using 'SJW' to define anyone who makes a feminist argument is a pretty damning indictment of your own social conservatism. ",0,1414969257,null,0,false,0,clr6rt4,t3_2l0dq2,t1_clr6rt4,t1_clqabvp,null,1426222789,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

But they do believe, as a general principle, that you can't have a single market which allows business to move freely and operate seamlessly between countries, while blocking the movement of individuals. Although I understand why people ask for caps, I can also see things from the German perspective. When Britain was its own customs union, we would have been utterly appalled if someone had suggested individual movement be prevented or restricted. Obviously that's not a perfect parallel, but that is the way that people see the issue - freedom of movement being a fundamental individual right, to balance up corporate rights within the single market.

If anything Rodgers has shown he is versatile by playing diferent formations meaning we need 4 strikers regardless of how we play.

No we didn't play diamond straight away but it wasn't till we played the diamond that we hit our best form. Sturridge came in and Rodgers tinkered till he found the best formation where the 2 forwards, Coutinho and Sterling all fit in the same tea.

I never implied his philosophy couldn't change, and I struggle to understand how you could think that. The whole message I talked about how he went from possession based (which he did, he used to talk about 'passing teams to death') to very direct, counter attacking football where we started fast and tried to blow away teams. This in itself suggests that I'm aware that he's happy to change the team around.

I'm struggling to understand your wording on your penultimate paragraph, I never suggested the diamond doesn't work now, in fact I said how well it worked against Tottenham when Balotelli and Sturridge played up front together.
The diamond didn't use wingers either, so i'm not sure what you mean by Suarez or Sturridge went to the wing. I guess you meant they are versatile and would swap positions, which is true of course. 

No possession football wasn't the focus last year. After Sturridge arrived it became attack focused. 
My post only suggested that the possession based style Rodgers came to the club with seemed to be making a comeback, especially after Rodger's post match comments against newcastle. 

I want to point out as well, I think Rodgers is a top manager and if he left it would be a travesty, he's a great manager and will work out the team sooner or later.

The history of labor law in the United Kingdom is a long, long series of reforms and regulations being enforced upon corporations and rich fat british ""Lords"" in order to ensure that british workers had rights which were being robbed of them either by the simple availability of replacement personnel or by absurdly one-sided employment agreements. 

Minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws, work-place safety, not only related to machinery, but to building regulations, fire exits, child-labor laws, sexual harassment laws... the list is ongoing. The simple fact is this: the corporation exists to maximize profits. If this means that they can systematically rape workers for their gain, and get away with it, they will.

Employer-employee contracts are not bargained for. The fact that they even constitute contracts is a legal fiction, in the technical sense. In a country where there is unemployment, it is a statistical joke to think that job-seekers have any bargaining power in the negotiation of their employment agreements.

They have to make new accounts because they get banned for their views dumbass. This is circular logic, if they didn't get banned for supporting UKIP, they wouldn't have to make new accounts, yet you condemn them for making new accounts anyway?

The last time we saw the Master, he was pulled back to a Time Locked Gallifrey with Rassilon and the ruling council, just before it was annihilated by the Moment, after the 10th Doctor shot the controls of his wormhole dimension shift thing.

BUT WAIT! The Moment didn't destroy Gallifrey and time lock the war, it convinced the War Doctor to save it, with help from all 13 of his incarnations; they instead shoved it into a pocket dimension at just the right moment for the Daleks to fire and annihilate one another. (Which probably lent itself to Rassilon's plan *actually* working, and the Daleks surviving so they could pull their Long Game, but that's another topic.)

For his ""failure"", Rassilon probably had the Master locked away somewhere. But the Master is a slippery fellow, so he found a way to escape.... And where did he escape to? Well, he must have known that there was something fishy... He didn't come to Gallifrey just before it was annihilated, it was still around! So he attempted the same thing the ruling council did to rip themselves away from the pocket dimension... WITHOUT an anchor. And it worked, and he found himself through a crack in the universe, in the attic of a church in a town called Christmas on Trenzalore.

Of course, he didn't go through without a scratch, and the Master that resembles John Simm began to regenerate into his female incarnation.

false,hexanaticious,wardr,Hurt,"Gonna have to disagree, not because I believe the theory of Amy and Rory appearing again in the Nethersphere, as much as there's two flaws in your argument. 

First one, space is not an issue even talking in the hundreds of Billions, just consider the fact that it's Gallifreyan technology, mixed with the fact that it's became a running gag since 10 expanded his pockets to make things hold more then they possibly could. Plus the Nethersphere's internal construct hasn't been confirmed yet, but it's likely either TARDISlike given I believe it was called a Gallifreyan matrix, or just virtual meaning everything inside is a simulation using data. 

Second reason, Time does not in fact seem to matter. Promised Land was known in 1190, and in the 1890's it either existed, or somehow saved a robot. Likewise it existed in what could have been the far future (though that is unclear) as shown in Into the Dalek

Series 1 - 2 episodes of crap farting green fellas , 3 episodes of Daleks

Series 2 - 3 cybermen episodes, 2 dalek episodes. And the return of an older companion Sarah Jane. 

Series 3 - 2 dalek episodes, the reuse of 'new earth' from series 2, 3 master episodes. 

Series 4 - 2 dalek episodes and RTD resurrects every previously used companion from the last 4 series. 3 Martha episodes after she left just the series before

Specials - cybermen return and are turned into dogs/wolve cat things. 2 master returns episode, the Master returns and oh every companion previously in the last 4 series once again return to cameo. 

That's 9 dalek episodes, 2 are used as finales. 4 cybermen episodes. 
Out of 60 episodes 45 take place on earth. 

Now Moffat stats

Series 5 - 2 angel episodes, 2 silurian episodes (not counting finale with appearances from all enemies sort of 2 with dalek and cybermen if I did) 

Series 6 - 0 dalek episodes, 2 crap gingers episodes (with the idea coming to fruition in a later episode) 

Series 7 - 1 cybermen episode, 3 great intelligence episode's 1 dalek episode, 1 angel episode

Specials - About time war so featured daleks another featured cybermen and return of old companion. 

Moffat has used the Angels 3 major times, Daleks 4 or 5 depending on how you look at it, either appearances or major plot devices. Silurians 2 times with the exception of Vastra . 

Because I'm not being one sided, he's used River in 11 episodes and Paternoster in 4.

Out of 43 episodes, 25 take place on Earth. 

Can't believe I just sat there with my Dvds and worked that out, basically reuse happens no matter who is writing. You think no other writer is going to do it when a new show runner takes place? Both show runners have made there own little Who world's, with characters they enjoy writing I didn't care if they reuse them as long as they are enjoyable to watch. I love Moffats reign, wasn't a fan of RTD as much but I enjoyed it regardless. 

On a separate yet related note, for a show with a time and space  traveling machine, far too many take place on earth. 9 times in a run of 13 episodes is too much.

Added on to that alot of the time when the pass gets to the midfielder he has a defender right on his back forcing him to pass straight back to the defender resulting in us repeating the slow build up process.

The simple fact is that the team may be the strongest in the PL at full strength but a couple of medium or long-term injuries would throw it away. One of the key locations is CB. The highest level back-up CB is the first-choice RB so if Terry or Cahill got injured the team would be on four established players for four positions with untested players as back up. Pique may not be the best option but he's proven at the top level and would make everything just that bit safer. On top of that the lack of players is going to make things difficult later in the season where important matches come more frequently. The rotation of Zouma recently could be taken as him needing experience or it could be that Terry in particular (but also Cahill) are getting worn down by the workload. There's also the added benefit that buying him would deprive United of a defender when they could really do with one which would be pretty good.

He's not cheap but 25 million isn't that expensive for a decent CB either given some of the business in summer. He offers some positives and the team has money to spend.

false,tusksrus,,Blairite | Join us on IRC! See the sidebar for details.,"It's an oversight body with very limited power. It's very simplistic to say that to be against Lords reform is to be against more democracy per se. Would you want the chief constable of police to be elected? The governor of the Bank of England? The heads of MI5 and MI6? Judges? Any of the other many and varied unelected but essential positions in or associated with the Government?

As long as the Lords is not elected, it has very limited power and merely acts as an advisory body with gravity. The Parliament Act can be invoked by the Commons without it taking any input from the Lords whatsoever - it simply chooses not to because the elected Commons values the input of the Lords. The same Act means the Lords do not get to reject money bills (the most important bills). The Lords do not, by convention, reject bills that were in the governing party's manifesto.

To just reject what /u/joethepro36 is saying with ""you're saying you're against democracy"" is very simplistic indeed. It is indeed not democratic (although the majority of its members are appointed by the elected PM - I know, I know, FPTP), but not every body of the state has to be elected - it's only a matter of keeping power below a threshold for the unelected bodies. With an unelected Lords, the Commons is the supreme house in Parliament. 

An elected Lords opens a whole new can of worms - you've seen what happens in the USA when opposing parties get control in the two chambers (although their bizarre Presidential system also contributes). It would even make more sense to simply abolish the Lords. 

But better still! Let's keep it as an unelected oversight and advisory body, with only soft power and clearly subordinate to the Commons. Reforms need to be made to it (Lords Spiritual, the remaining hereditary peers, the sheer number of Lords that there are with no form retirement process, others...) - but making it elected is probably the worst possible reform.",0,1414976351,null,0,false,0,clraf2x,t3_2kyllw,t1_clraf2x,t1_clqdm76,null,1426221089,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1

Last season on MOTD I remember they highlighted sequences of play where coutinho was on the ball and he always had 4 options for a pass the players were all moving together in an X shape which mean there was always somewhere for the ball to go, other than the back 4.

This season if you pause the game on any given attack there is nobody within a reliable passing range, I notice so many easy interceptions cause the best option available is a really difficult pass.

Our best chances usually come from quick passing between players at short range, think Lallanas goal. The off the ball motions have not been good enough, I think part of the issue is when we play with 4-3-3 and wide forwards.

Another thing is we don't have any physical strength in midfield, Coutinho and Allen in particular never win a header and sometimes don't even challenge for the ball in the air, when we end up playing with wide forwards we have the striker and Allen, Lallana, Coutinho, Sterling etc as support for any cross which comes in, which is useless.

On evening only show days lounge about, go shopping when it is quiet, head into work about 4. Work ends about half 11, then pub (not always drinking, but in theatre you don't really talk to your colleagues because you are too busy, so you head to the pub after to actually talk). Get in at 1am, then read/watch tv till 3am. Only get one day off a week, which I try not to waste by getting out into the world no matter how fed up I am. 

My advice is force yourself out. Or at the very least, don't go home straight away. Find something you can do, even if it is going for a walk or treating yourself to a meal you didn't cook. Head to the movies by yourself or something. Doesn't have to be every night, it'll help you feel like your day hasn't only been about work. I have had that, theatre isn't always late starts. When you are setting a show up, it is 12 hour days (sometimes more) and a metric ton of stress, but if you don't grab 1/2 an hour for yourself you get depressed really quick.
