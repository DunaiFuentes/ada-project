So perhaps the difference can in fact be split, there.

As for size, we didn't actually see it happen, but that does seem very unlikely. 

Of course, HOW did it gain mass in the first place is still a mystery.

The nuclear bomb thing bothered me. Just having them on the surface wouldn't do much of anything. I guess third rate astronauts wouldn't know that, but surely the people who sent them there successfully would?

And how on earth does a space program that create a lunar base get mothballed because it went dark?!?

&gt;

&gt;___Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em___ is a [BBC television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_television) [sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_sitcom), written by [Raymond Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Allen_(scriptwriter\)) and starring [Michael Crawford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crawford) and [Michele Dotrice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Dotrice). It was first broadcast in 1973 and ran for three series, ending in 1978.

&gt;The series follows the accident-prone Frank Spencer and his tolerant, if accident-prone wife, Betty, through Frank's various attempts to hold down a job, which frequently end in disaster. The sitcom was filmed in and around the town of Bedford in Bedfordshire.

&gt;Noted for its stuntwork, performed by [Michael Crawford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crawford) himself as well as featuring various well-remembered catchphrases, the series was voted #22 in the BBC's poll ""[Britain's Best Sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britain%27s_Best_Sitcom)"".

One last little note, about Brighton and for much any other area, that from my experience scenery is merely all it really is.  Your life is the sum of what you make of it, and Brighton offers nothing more than any where else.  It is a wonderful town for some (I feel the City title is misleading -it's just a slightly bigger town with Hove added on), and for others it's just as lonely or somewhat as socially isolating as other places.  It is always down to who you know, and that's a veriable which by chance or luck, can be in your favour.

I spent 3 years in Leeds, and was lucky to meet nice, genuine people.  It hasn't come together quite like that, down here.

This didn't bother me, because the story was about what decision Clara/humanity would make, and where the mass was coming from didn't really affect that decision. Once the doctor disappeared right after confirming that the moon was an egg, the only decision left was whether to push the big red button or not.

And I thought part of the drama was the Doctor abandoning them with no way of finding out anything more about the moon creature. The doctor could have explained everything, but he didn't so they had to act in ignorance, which made it more terrifying. I don't think it was unrealistic that they didn't speculate on where the mass was coming from, because they had no way of answering that question and knowing the answer wouldn't change anything.

Those who hated it, would it have made a difference if the Doctor had thrown off some line about a trans-dimensional umbilical cord or something? Everything else the same, no other information, just 2 second of technobable?

It did annoy me slightly that they started out saying the problem was the moon increasing in mass and causing apocalyptic tides, then suddenly the problem was the moon breaking up and the way to solve it is kill the moon creature. The moon still would have been way too big and causing mass floods. They could have made geologic instability the problem they came up to fix, though I'm not sure how they would expect to fix that with nukes. Collapse the core something something neutron flow, idk.

Leaving a few seconds early instead of waiting the last few moments just to get a rile out of the other coach isn't disrespectful?

What world do you live in? I went into detail about it in the previous thread but Mourinho isn't exactly leaving 5min or 10min before the whistle. He is leaving like 5 - 10 seconds before the whistle. It provides no other use other than doing it just because you know it will have an effect, both on the other coach and potentially the media.

If Mourinho genuinely had to leave early for something he should just get up and leave a few minutes before. But there is no difference between leaving at the 93rd minute or leaving at the 93:06. Instead he does does a half-ass handshake just to mess with someone else. 

Mourinho is a smart man, if you dont think he knows 100% what he is doing when he leaves a few seconds early you know nothing about Jose.

false,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"The only problem I have with this kind of commentary and criticism is that I always wonder if those making the commentary would be the same people complaining if it was just the Doctor and a male companion this whole time because then there would be a distinct lack of females in the show as main characters. 

So how would the showrunners be expected put the show in balance, bring a woman on as a co-companion. With most showrunners and writers this would probably lead to the exact same situation as we have now just the men would be the primary focus.

And romance actually played somewhat of a big part in early Who with Ian/Barbara and Ben/Polly ending up in relationships while on the TARDIS and Jamie wanted to convince Victoria to stay being quite obvious that he had some feelings for her. Susan, Vicki, Jo, Leela, and possibly Peri all left the TARDIS for love with only Jo falling for love with someone from her own time. And even Mel left for another man although definitely not for love. And the biggest complaints most people have for these endings is that the characters left the TARDIS for people they just met.

The other major reasons for leaving the TARDIS were finally returning home or being forced there (Ian/Barbara, Dodo, Jamie, Zoe, Harry, Sarah, Tegan, Turlough) or feeling some obligation to stay behind (Steven, Romana, Nyssa), or if extremely unlucky death (Katarina, Sara Kingdom, Adric). 

Victoria and Liz Shaw probably have the most interesting and unique stories of any companion staying behind where Victoria chose to live in a different time on Earth because she found surrogate parents and Liz felt that the Doctor didn't appreciate her or her intelligence and went off to teach and study at Cambridge.

Things are different now than Classic Who however. When people left the TARDIS in Classic was more permanent because the Doctor couldn't really control the TARDIS all that well. People had to make harder decisions about whether or not to leave because it was likely permanent. So most of the companion departures were abrupt.

These days since the Doctor can more effectively pilot a TARDIS, people are less inclined to leave home permanently or the TARDIS permanently when they can have both. So people aren't suddenly removed from their relationships and obligations with no hope to return. And despite the romance angles each one has been decidedly different take on the whole affair (kind-of sort-of boyfriend/girlfriend, mutual Doctor/companion relationship, flirting omnisexual, unrequited love for the Doctor, childhood sweethearts getting married, Doctor/River temporal relationship). 

Every companion that left also had other intense non love circumstances which forced their partings with the Doctor otherwise many of them probably would have stayed forever. Rose was first separated by a parallel world, Martha stayed behind to take care of her family, Donna was forced to stay behind for her life, Amy couldn't see the Doctor anymore because of the paradox, River couldn't see him anymore because of their complex temporal relationship.

And even though people laud Donna as the non-romance companion she was at weddings to bookend her appearances and fell in love with a man on one of their adventures with whom she probably would have stayed with.

I do agree that it can be tiring to always have a romantic component with the companions but its not like they are literally doing the exact same story over and over again (although they might run out of basic templates soon) and its not like the relationships have made zero sense (Peri's and Mel's respective departures).

And personally this all comes from someone who wouldn't mind a sidelining of some of the romantic plots and who wants a primary male companion. And let's all be honest with ourselves that even with Ian, Steven, Harry, Adric, and Turlough the only real primary male companion we ever had was Jamie and even then he was still paired with a woman except for The Two Doctors (although we did technically have Wilfred Mott for two episodes and a few episodes here and there while switching over female companions). 

In particular I want a lone male companion either in the vein of Ian, Jamie, or Turlough (and age can really be any range for me).",0,1412903657,null,0,false,0,cl59zim,t3_2isyx4,t1_cl59zim,t3_2isyx4,null,1426601137,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

I think they can.

The issue UKIP have had, in this regard, is that a fringe party pulling 2% or less of the vote at general elections tends to attract 1) people who are opposed to ""conventional wisdom,"" that believe things well outside of the Overton window, and 2) nutters. Usually such parties are doing well to have a candidate standing for a constituency or ward. It would seem as though the only requirement to become a UKIP council candidate, in the 1990s up until their recent successes, was a desire to do so and to not be offensive to most of the five senses. UKIP lacked the resources, or the instinct, to vet their own party candidates, which caused considerable embarrassment.

Let's say UKIP win most of [the dozen seats they are targeting](http://www.theweek.co.uk/politics/60125/farage-stands-in-thanet-south-and-targets-8-more-tory-seats) in May 2015, finishing with something on the order of ~10 MPs. Obviously, they're not going to run Johnny Yobbo in those constituencies, but their better candidates. Should they win and show themselves a credible parliamentary party, then they will attract more quality, conventional candidates.

UKIP is better served, and I suspect they realize this, by getting 10 ""good MPs"" and respectable vote shares in a lot of other places, than gaining 10 good MPs plus 30 gobshites in their parliamentary caucus.",0,1412910571,null,0,false,0,cl5db90,t3_2itfv9,t1_cl5db90,t1_cl5clat,null,1426599585,5,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5

EU Membership fees and foreign aid really don't constitute the colossal, all-encompassing portion of government expenditure that Farage and his clowns are fond of suggesting. 

*We can handle it*, in the case of the EU- and, given the benefits of membership, we're getting plenty out of membership. 

As to foreign aid? It's an international initiative. The small fraction of the national budget that goes to DFID and the like is absolutely worth the money.

I'd rather take a 1% cut in the national budget over cutting our foreign aid contributions by 100%- particularly given how little aid is necessary to save thousands upon thousands upon thousands of lives in the developing world, how much of said money goes directly back into the economy as payments to British companies, and how much good it does.

false,weblypistol,cnty-uk,Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.... etc.,"Labour can point to low turnout and an increased vote share. But truthfully that is not the true picture. A crude vote share analysis says that this came from liberal and Tory votes. I doubt that is accuratte and suspect some Labour votes went Ukip, some votes were not previous voters, and to increase by 1% is not a massive vote of confidence though that has to be balanced with the continual nonsensical drip drip drip attacks on Miliband and the local sex scandal. I suspect this will change at the election.

Perversely I see the Clacton result as worse for Labour, a 14% drop of share. That is on a low figure though. The point is that Labour voters sat on their arses and some formers probably voted Ukip, the Lib Dems are insignificant and gone as a protest vote ( they even left as a presence on BBC coverage at some point), and the Tories have a real problem. I would say Labour have a problem if right wingers unite under Ukip ( LibDems you have right wingers, Orange Bookers, you know who you are). That can't be ignored but expect different at a general election.

What I do suspect is the denigration of Miliband is playing to right wing votes shifting, and denigration of Ukip probably only minimally hurts Labour but boost reactionary votes for Ukip against Tory votes. It is not plain sailing for the consistently poll leading Labour party (despite stories) or the stuck at an eighth for Ukip, but it was clearly Ukip's night. Happy birthday Mr Cameron. Could be the beginning of the fracturing of the right wing vote.

* [A 4 pinter at Morrisons is £1.39.][1] You have to buy 3 of them to get it down to the £1 mark.  
There are other stores who sell a 4 pinter for £1 without having to buy 2+ for that price point.

&gt; I can get a whole week's worth of milk for pocket change. I don't know why I just love buying milk that cheap. I know what they're up to though, they put it right at the back so you have to walk past about 70% of the supermarket to get to it.

As your name is ""RedEdMilliband"", I find it hilarious that you made such a glaring mistake given that only 2 years ago, the BBC was asking [""Should politicians know the price of a pint of milk?""] [3] and more recently [""Ed Miliband criticised over '£70-a-week' shopping bill""] [4]

To quote the latter article:

&gt; Mr Miliband then conceded that he did “probably pay more”, but added: “I am relatively comfortably off, but what I know is that there are deep issues that need to be tackled and we are determined to tackle them.”

However, are you 100% sure you'll be together for ever? a joint mortgage is a big commitment, akin to marriage.
For me the answer to the above was yes, so it was easy to do. I was the one putting in the majority of the deposit, and sounds like its your gf in this case, so make sure she isn't pressured into choosing a joint one, if she doesn't want to - you can always join the mortgage at a later stage.

If you put it in those terms 51% is really quite poor. The best you can say is that slightly more people voted than didn't (35,338 -vs- 33,681 - a difference of 1,656 people) which is hardly a massive endorsement of representative democracy.

And sure UKIP took 59.7% of the votes and attained a 35.1% majority of votes cast, but that's still only 59.7% of 51% of voters, which is 30.4% of total voters. And that's not only quite low, but also not a majority of voters.

What? You can't really believe that can you?

They want us to leave a common market with which we conduct 44% of our trade.

Yes we could do a Norway and stay out of it but in reality Norway is an EU member in all but name. Some would say so more than we are currently, they are in the schegen zone and so have less control over immigration than we do. They are bound by all EU legislation related to markets, things we currently have opt outs for, but have *no vote* in what that EU law is. 

On top of all this they have to pay a fee relative to their GDP to have access. Last year that was 290 million euro. 

&gt; As for the ECHR, UKIP would get rid of it yes, but they would also introduce a British bill of rights.

This is literally the definition of isolationism. Leaving a collective institution to set up your own institution. 

Also what would a British bill of rights include? It could be a massive rolling back of rights, no one knows.

&gt; ""isolating itself"" and ""pissing off its allies"" without actually clarifying what you mean.

I mean these are both pretty self explanatory aren't they? We will piss of our allies by breaking treaties, leaving common markets, weakening the EU.

Interactive Investors are probably the cheapest if you're using regular investing (£1.50). In particular: if you are going to bring your portfolio up to a fair size in the next few years (noting that the moving fees for many brokers are hefty) you should prefer to pay a small fixed fee over a percentile fee; the latter bites you as you grow. 

Also worth noting that AJ Bell are very expensive to leave, at £25 per holding.

Just some example numbers for a fixed fee broker: £20 per quarter (including 8 'free' trades per year) seems a bit expensive when you have only £5000 invested, but is cheap when you are over ~£20,000. Once you hit bigger numbers like £100,000+ it's an absolute no brainer (£200+ vs £80).

I'm a big fan of the KISS! approach (Keep It Simple, Stupid!). Complicated finances can be hard to track (though not impossible).

Chances are, on the numbers you're talking about, whilst you may end up with the theoretical optimum interest-rate return, the time cost outweighs this marginal benefit.

An ""ideal"" plan, in my mind, would be:

* A high-interest current account to stash your pay for the short-term. The benefit of Santander 123 gets smaller as the sums reduce, due to the fixed £24 PA fee. On £3,000 the 3.0% headline rate is reduced to 2.2% thanks to the fee. Something like Nationwide or Lloyds offering 5% on a lower-capped amount may work better.

* All spending undertaken on a cashback credit card, paid in full every month. This way you are earning interest on the funds in your current account, and 0.5%-1.0% back on the spending.

* Once you have amassed a comfortable emergency fund (3-6 months' expenditure) in a high-interest current account, funnel the rest into a low-cost S&amp;S ISA. On this note I'd look at Charles Stanley Direct (0.25% PA admin fee) and low-cost index trackers (a simple approach being Vanguard Lifestrategy 60%, which is 60/40 equity bond). 

* You could split the equity/bond exposure so you could rebalance actively, by buying something like Vanguard LS 100% and Vanguard Global Bond (hedged) in your preferred proportion. There are no buy fees through CSD either. Total cost PA will be sub-0.5% and you can setup monthly DDs with auto-investment instructions as low as £50 per fund.

The problem is it's quite hard to do an ""old man's"" Yorkshire accent in writing, most of my answers would seem almost comical if I tried to write them phonetically as they'd actually be said in an accent. There are a few changes to dialect that are easy to do it words because ultimately that's what dialect is.

But then in reality they wouldn't actually be said different enough to justify spelling it differently. Also the language choice might vary greatly dependent on character and mood etc.

""modern"" - for example. Modern would be a word that would be used quite happily it's not like there's a Yorkshire vocab alternative, it's just the accent would lay more emphasis on the M and maybe the d and you'd not really hear the r at all.
There are a few phrase which you could use instead however, like ""fuckin' fancy"" etc but these would vary greatly depending on setting.

ugly (referring to floats on a parade) - Again it's a ""one worder"", Ugly is in common use, see my answer above.

""you used to be such a nice lad"" - A little easier, maybe something like ""you/tha used t'be a good 'un"" but the accent would make ""used"" sound like ""ust"" the ""ed"" is really pronounced and is finished quickly

""is everything okay here?"" (asking how a worker is getting on with his work) - maybe something like ""Everythin' 'rite?"" but again pronouncing ""all right"" as ""'rite"" isn't easily done in books.

""Lad, how are you?"" - ""'Ow's thee doin' lad?"" - I'm strugling with writing the correct pronunciation here again.

""have you heard about Mrs Smith?"" - This is the best example of being difficult to put the pronunciation in writing, vocab changes would probably use ""has"" rather than have and I can't imagine many times ""Mrs Smith"" would but used but not knowing the relationship between character and Mrs Smith makes it hard to suggest a decent alternative. But the pronunciation part accent would make it very different sounding ""has"" would become ""'As"", ""you"" becomes ""thee"" but that's wrong in itself because ""thee"" make it look too old english with a long ""E"" at the end, it'd be more of a ""thi"" but that looks ridiculous to write. ""heard"" would just drop the h to ""'eard""

""She died, just like that."" - Wouldn't necessarily have a dialect change of words but ""died"" would be pronounced ""deed"" and the t at the end of just would be lost. ""Like"" would also be pronounced differently.

Disclaimer: the suggestions above also are more suited to South Yorkshire and specifically Barnsley, I and can't really claim to speak on behalf of the population of there, never mind glorious Yorkshire as a whole, so of course people might disagree with the above.

++EDIT++ Tidied up some comments where I used dialect incorrectly. I understand vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation all make up dialect. I had been referring to dialect solely as vocab (which is wrong) and ""accent"" purely as the pronunciation/grammar (also wrong) - I've corrected that now.

The point is summed up best in a new TL:DR

TL:DR The South Yorkshire accent for me is defined by the pronunciation and grammar used,  both of which are hard to put into words without people thinking you can't spell. Any vocab changes that you could make easily will also look wrong without the pronunciation changes.",0,1412929231,null,0,1412935289,0,cl5iw9x,t3_2iu2t4,t1_cl5iw9x,t3_2iu2t4,null,1426596910,3,false,yorkshire,t5_2rz9n,3

Essentially - if the West increases the distribution of GM crops to the majority of the world's farmers, which are the poorest people on earth, then farmers no longer have the ability to afford the yearly costs of buying the seeds and will likely starve more than they are already. Farmers caught producing food that is not GM, or that they have been storing GM seeds can/are fined. This also replaces any kind of local knowledge they had - quite a lot of the farmers had drought resistant production methods for centuries through using biodiversity and a range of crops, but then European powers turned up and introduced monocultures, which is essentially putting all your eggs into one basket, with GM trying to work out how to protect those eggs.

1. You're only accounting for the costs of immigrants. Yes, they take school places. But they also pay tax which pays for school places. In this respect an immigrant is basically the same as a new born, so it's effectively an argument against population growth in general.

2. It doesn't account for falling birth rates. An ageing population is an economic timebomb because you end up with huge numbers of dependants relative to workers. We need immigration to avoid this, and your proposed figure of 30-50,000 is simply not enough to plug the gap.

3. The ""it's unsustainable"" argument is not premised on any kind of fact. The UK in fact has capacity for a significantly higher population that we currently have. Only [2.27%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18623096) of the UK is ""built on"" land.

false,Rushysleftfoot,null,null,"This is what I'm talking about, you say have you have better knowledge and wisdom and you ignore everything in all my posts, so I'm going to go through it for you.

&gt;Now you talk about how Balotelli is a ""consistent under performing player"". TIL that playing 7 league games with a completely new team (no players he's ever worked with save for Kolo, who hasn't featured this season) is considered consistently under performing.

While i mentioned the 8 games I'm referring to his underperformance for his entire career not just his liverpool start so far. You cannot disagree that the hype around this guy has always been there and yet not a single 20+ goal season nor has his play ever been considered completely team friendly plus he has been given chance after chance to be a key figure in top sides and proven to be less than successful, so why even attempt to build around someone like that.

&gt;I understand full well how marking systems work- suddenly freeing Gerrard of a marker doesn't turn him into fucking Kal El. Even without a marker, do you think he can harry players, hassle the fullbacks when they push up, win the ball, break with acceleration, and play the ball to one of the strikers before any of the opposition midfield can track back? Let me answer that for you, no he can't. That's because he's 33 years old. Name one 33 year old that is still going strong as a dynamic attacking midfielder in the world, let alone the premier league- (protip, you can't).

Gerrard doesn't have to be a dynamic attacking midfielder to be effective the best in the history of the game have always used their brain to be quicker than everyone on the pitch and you as a fully qualified pro who has watched him on numerous occasions especially in his best performing seasons will know that his passing in the final third is good enough to be a threat. But you mention the defensive work so now I question whether you've watched either Pirlo or Scholes play, the teams were set up to make best use of their talent and at the same time to make up for their deficiencies. 

&gt;Then you suggest we completely change the system and remold it to fit Gerrard in up top. Scholes and Pirlo didn't have teams built around them- they were extremely lucky that the players around them were skilled/flexible enough to accommodate their playing style. Those players accommodating them were established, and somewhat experienced players (Rooney, Nistelrooy, Ronaldo, etc.) Are you seriously considering playing Henderson, Coutinho, Sterling, Markovic, etc. in positions solely to accommodate for Steven Gerrard going forward? Because that's exactly how you limit a player's growth. You're willing to sacrifice 3-4 young players' effectiveness, learning, and potential just to put a 33 year old Gerrard up front? That's ridiculous.

Hey pro here's a trade secret I'll let you in on, formations aren't set in stone as a pro who watched Liverpool last season you should be fully aware of the ever changing set up of the team, and come on lucky? That's a pathetic excuse to ignore the obvious. At juve Pirlo is surrounded by a raft of midfielders to make up for his lack of defensive ability, wing backs to cover the flanks, energetic and athletic midfielders to track back and be runners (create space), a big target man up front to receive. The entire set up is built around him. At United it's as you yourself mentioned Rooney dropped back to provide defensive cover, a strong midfield partner, athletic wingers etc. 

Firstly how is learning new positions limiting a players growth? And anyway In a 4-2-3-1 (the system for the last 20 mins at WBA) the players you mentioned would still be in positions they know very well, you talk of Markovic and Coutinho as if they're going to be relied on while even in the current set up right now they're not and newsflash. Henderson is established and sterling is pretty much well on his way to being a key player for the club. When I envision the set up for the team it's about squeezing out the little that's left in the tank for Gerrard, he'll be gone after this year or the next but while you have a player of that quality at your disposal use them or lose them and you can't disagree that as a DM/DLP he is punching above his weight.

&gt;That's just scratching the surface- you don't even begin to understand that dropping to a 1 striker set up would simply lead to us scoring less goals, which with our leaky backline is a recipe for disaster. The reason we were scoring stupid amounts of goals last season was due to the linkup between SAS. Look at games we didn't have Suarez. 1-0 wins and losses. Sure, Suarez is Superman and El Fenomeno's lovechild, but Brendan's philosophy and the way the team was picked is meant to play 2 strikers and to have goal production between them, Sturridge alone isn't going to bag you 50 goals a season. Gerrard won't be scoring very many open field ones, and the goals he will score will have to come off of penalties and free kicks- which, oh would you look at that, Sturridge would have to earn in the box, a la Suarez. 

This is where I can't understand the want from you to operate in the diamond anymore you know that SAS was the stuff of dreams but that dream is over, when I say this formation leaks I think less of 1-0 losses here and there and more to the smaller games where we should've had no problem (palace away/ Cardiff away etc) where quite rightly as you say we were capable of scoring a huge amount of goals but Balotelli and Sturridge are not gonna get you the same amount as last season. Knowing this you should take extra measures to fix areas we are weak in the defence and defensive midfield, you're trying to focus on scoring 100 goals again and going straight back for the title that will not work, baby steps first because as it is this is being set up for a season that's way out of reach.

&gt;For fuck's sake, open your eyes kid. Gerrard doing well for 10-15 minutes, at the end of a match, up front, AGAINST WEST BROM, at home doesn't mean that it's a good option going forward. This is just silly talk, I'm not even going to entertain the idea any further than this. You can put whatever last word you want in.

And you open yours this isn't about 10-15 minutes against WBA this is about a player who produced his best football behind the striker and is being put in a position that he doesn't fit in to suit a philosophy that only began to work last season. You call yourself a pro and you can't have a valid discussion because you're too good for that and you know better than everyone else though right?

&gt;If someone has control over their finances, and the ability to pay back the loan in a timely manner, they don't turn to Wonga.

Oh, sorry i didn't realise you spoke for me.

&gt;Banks give you loans based on you proving you don't need it.

No they don't they give it based on your ability to repay vs your history of debt.

&gt;Wonga is predatory. A hell of a lot of customers that just had their debts written off had multiple loans with Wonga.

Maybe 2 years ago, for the past year wonga has had much stricter lending criteria inculding credit references.


&gt;This type of lending is predatory. End of. Sure, payday loans are not too horrible, if regulated properly (Like, I dunno, the way Aussies have done it, with interest rates getting capped so you cannot end up owing too much). 

But that's not what Wonga does anymore. 

&gt;Nobody should turn to Wonga. Ever. Crisis loans from the Government should be their first port of call.

Crisis loans aren't available to the vast majority of workers.

&gt;Its never 5 pounds to borrow 80 pounds for a week. Its 30 pounds to borrow 500 pounds for a month, which you cannot pay back, which becomes hundreds of pounds more with late fees, random fees and the fucking interest on top. 

Then why are you taking the loan if you can't afford it?

Sorry it's £10 for 80 quid over 7 days, my mistake.

No, they said they need to reconsider their position on the EU. That's what UKIP have done, they haven't made parties want to connect more with the public, they've made the parties want to be more like UKIP: more populist, more right wing, less sensible.

I'm not saying that we shouldn't be considering immigrants' longterm health prospects, as part of UKIP's famous ""points system"", but doing so should require assessment of all measurable health risks, not just those a politician has pulled out of his arse.

At some point it becomes expensive to administer the bureaucracy (which is something that UKIP will usually claim to be cutting down on), but it would also be worthwhile to ask whether immigrants have ever smoked cigarettes or if they have a family history of heart disease or breast cancer.

So really it would be ""'Ow's tha doin' lad?"".

You can't have a free market without workers. Restricting workers' movement will turn the market into a capital only market, where funds move freely but workers can't. Therefore, those owning capital will benefit while the rest will suffer. UKIP's policies are contradictory; you can't argue simultaneously for free market and worker movement restrictions. 

In addition, one of the reasons that the UK does relatively well is its participation in and access to the EU market. Border controls work both ways and if the UK imposes them, so will the rest of the EU against British companies and citizens.

Certainly I think less immigration of unskilled people from the developing world would be positive for our economy as it would reduce the drain on our public services.

In terms of the European Union, I regard the trading bloc as structurally flawed due to the failed monetary union, and I believe its importance as an export market will increasingly decline relative to the rest of the world. I believe it would be far better to have a trade agreement similar to that of the about to be announced Canada-EU deal, where they get huge free access to the European market without needing to obey by a lot of the unnecessary regulation, very damaging agricultural system, free movement and common external tariff.

false,themedes,cnty-england,Cambridge,"i think the main issue is that people are conflating influenza and ebola, and saying because more people die of influenza thats its OK dont worry. influenza is not a hemmoragic (bleeding from orifices) virus, ebola is. this is main difference. Also note Influenza is NOT THE COMMON COLD. This is a common misconception.

influenza has been in the general world population for a long long time, and a lot of people have been exposed to it. this has resulted in humans forming some basic defence against influenza. the high number of deaths are due to older people and the young or the higher risk people (ie asthmatics) dieing from it, and the fact that it is exposed to a much larger % of the population. 

now ebola. this is secluded to northwest africa, has been exposed to only a fraction of what influenza was, total population immunity will be very low as most humans will not have come into contact with it. the low number of deaths are due to the african practices of shutting / closing the whole village from outside world once an outbreak occurs (ensuring it never leaves the village), they let it run rampant and the outbreak to either die naturally or kill the entire village, this is why we see such low numbers of deaths. 

now it has got beyond this point and into larger cities, virologists are now seeing many mutations (upto about 250 variations on the original strain so far in africa alone) on the original 7 gene sequence that is ebola, and the longer it persists in the wild (ie. world) the more chance it has of mutating into something more nasty and survivable or transferable. there is also the factor of how will it change/adapt to colder climates, or in much much closer confines. some dr's are worried that even close proximity is enough for transfer aswell, although this hasnt been confirmed.

&gt;Essentially - if the West increases the distribution of GM crops to the majority of the world's farmers, which are the poorest people on earth, then farmers no longer have the ability to afford the yearly costs of buying the seeds and will likely starve more than they are already. 

Why does that have to be the case?  Also, it's nothing to do with GM itself- it relates to the commercialisation of the technology. There are ways around this that don't throw the baby out with the bath water.

&gt;This also replaces any kind of local knowledge they had - quite a lot of the farmers had drought resistant production methods for centuries through using biodiversity and a range of crops, but then European powers turned up and introduced monocultures, which is essentially putting all your eggs into one basket, with GM trying to work out how to protect those eggs. 

There weren't as many people to feed throughout those centuries.  Also, famine certainly did hit, probably more often than it does today.  I don't think that you can make the argument that agricultural technology hasn't delivered a net benefit in terms of feeding numbers of people.

&gt;Plus *currently* food security is a distribution problem, not a population or production problem.

This is true, but is it not better to give (or even sell) people some suitable seeds so they can grow food for themselves, rather than to give (or sell at a greater price than seeds) food produced elsewhere by others?  Seeds (or livestock) give people the start of a production economy, which is surely a better route out of poverty than relying on handouts or imports.

It's not good to dump the excess of subsidised western (largely American) food production on these places in need.  It's self defeating- it depresses the price of locally grown grain across the region, which provides less incentive to produce more locally, which leaves the people more dependent on imports and more vulnerable to famine.  It's good for western high production farmers, but not so much for those who become dependent.

Also the other interesting thing to come out of the EU study was none of the crops had a significant advantage either. They didn't increase yields by anything greater than an error value. The main reason that nations in Europe have become opposed to it is because of this lack of real advantage.

I guess as far as electoral system being broken goes I'm undecided. I don't believe the system we have is terribly representative, and I don't believe that voting once every 5 years to elect someone you rarely meet to represent you in Parliament is that great an idea either. OTOH I think that the majority of issues Parliament discusses are both involved and really quite dull, and - bar a surge of interest should reform occur - I honestly don't think most people are that bothered and they'd rather someone else deal with the humdrum nature of running an economy.

If HIV cannot be detected easily, it will not be enforced due to costs and the difficulty of implementation. If HIV cases are known in advance then the person can be blocked from entering without too much difficulty.

You're also making a false slippery slope argument. None of those diseases are transmittable, they cannot be compared.

So the people you believe are not intelligent/educated enough would have to be convinced to support a different position.

That's dangerous territory. When you validate your own views by assuring yourself that others are just stupid, you make yourself immune to criticism at the least, and snobbish and arrogant at the worst.

I happen to believe that many of Labour's economic policies are silly. Increasing NHS funding by an amount as small as £3bn will have no impact at all on the actual quality of treatment, and I think it's mainly just a political ploy to make themselves look good. I think the 'Wealth Tax' is a demonstrably terrible idea that is likely to cause massive capital flight and raise a pittance in revenue that's barely worth considering. I think that raising the top tax band to 50% is an irrelevant change that will raise such a small amount of money it's barely worth considering, and that this too is just an obvious attempt to maintain the image of defending ""ordinary people"".

But disagreeing with something and assuming idiocy on behalf of those that don't are two entirely different things. I would never in a thousand years allow myself to be conned into believing that my political opponents are somehow lesser than myself, and I consciously try to remind myself that I am one man with one perspective and incomplete information. Subsequently, it would be criminal to stereotype and degrade others for the sake of reaffirming my own beliefs.

For example in this country if there was someone who genuinely believed that the three main parties consisted of lizards in human skin and part of some conspiracy by the government and formed a political party around it, if you treat their views as legitimate instead of just ""wrong"" you risk legitimising a position that should instead be ridiculed.

This is especially true as plenty of research shows that you can predict political voting behaviours and perceptions far more clearly using emotional responses than logical ones.

Your attitude assumes that everyone is a rational, logical, human being when it comes to political affiliation. However, this has been *proven* not to be the case.

Therefore presenting facts to these people (approximately 80% of all people) is pointless. You can confront them with facts but they will only believe the ones that align with their already entrenched opinion on the world, which is formed via emotion.

Therefore there is no *point* engaging in logical debate with these people, because it is impossible to win. I could probably demolish a lot of what UKIP say in a way that would ""win me the debate"" in a debating club, but ultimately it will have 0 impact on the people who already believe what they say. Instead you need an emotional hook, to convince people to *feel* as if UKIP are wrong, and then they'll rationalise themselves.

As far as the songs go, they pick a song of the week every week and then sing it; they also had an ongoing series a year or two called, naturally, ""Shall We Sing a Song for You,"" in which they sang a classic Chelsea song every week and posted the lyrics online so that people who don't go to games can learn the songs in case they do ever go to games (or they just want to sing them at the TV and wake everyone up at 8am on a Saturday).

You just posted a load of links saying haemorrhaging wasnt a symptom. It is a symptom...

&gt;I said that flu like symptoms will be difficult to detect in winter, because that's when people tend to get the flu.

Well done, people get flu in winter. When people have the flu, they are often coughing and sneezing and if they run a fever can even be sweating.
All of these are viable modes of dispersing Ebola onto multiple surfaces. 

Now here is the big part. If the situation gets worse (like it did with swine flu), you are going to see the standard Health Protection Agency's practice of encouraging those with flu to stay away from others and try and ride it out at home. The reason for this is that if you see someone out and about suffering from these kinds of symptoms, its pretty obvious  that the person is ill and that you should stay away.

Its also a lot easier for the Health services to isolate these people because its obvious that they have symptoms. All in All its easier to detect these people because people will be vigilant to it, the health services will be vigilant to it and because the symptoms are fairly obvious whether its flu or something else. The principle idea is that those few who do travel out and about will be under surveillance from everyone around them and if in the worse case it is Ebola, the factors surrounding where the person could have spread it, is easier then if it wasnt encouraged for people to try to avoid human contact when ill. Furthermore so if someone isolates themselves at home its even easier.

While climate change is much broader. It is more localized. The impact of a sea or lake drying up as an example. That can and is man made. But it is through over consumption. There is no denying that our emissions are leading to more adverse and sever weather globally. But that does not mean the planet will turn into an ice cube or Mars. It also does not mean that every problem is related to this one gas. 

We contribute about 1.5 percent to global Co2 emissions. As economies around the world grow our share will continue to decline. Us going 100% clean would make no difference globally. To think that you will convince major emerging economies to go ''green'' is severely naive. The alternative globally is nuclear. If we want to make change, we need to back nuclear both nationally and internationally.

The former is really just a second (or deep-lying) striker, which itself is not much different than a conventional number 10. It's the position Stevie played behind Torres in those Rafa teams, and he was the best in the world at it during his peak.

As u/thefourthsnake said, he could absolutely do a job playing there -- he's still an elite player on the ball, and his natural instinct has always been to go forward. But it really is a mobility/endurance issue -- you lose the guile and pace you'd have on the attack when playing Sterling or Lallana there, and it's pretty obvious now this team is at its best when it attacks at pace.

Judging by what we saw vs. West Brom, I reckon having Stevie operate as the most advanced of three midfielders -- with two of Lucas/Allen/Henderson behind him -- would actually be an effective method when looking to shut games down.

But that also raises the question whether he can actually play that role for 90 minutes when he's having trouble shaking man-markers in his own half. So another option could be to have him play in that advanced attacking midfield/support striker/number 10 role for, say, 60-70 minutes and then pull the guy off to get some fresh legs out there.

Like I said, there's plenty of valid things that F4J have campaigned for and there's plenty of valid ways of campaigning for them. I'm a big fan of their superhero stunts - a brilliant method of attracting attention to an issue. 

The following from the article, regardless of your cause, is nutty territory: 

&gt; Late one evening, Mr O’Connor tweeted that “she can run but she can’t hide” and that F4J were in Romsey looking for her. He also posted messages saying that Ms Nokes should “be charged with child abuse”, while his followers sent death threats, saying they would burn her house down.

&gt; The O’Connors posted offensive messages about the nature of Mr Yalland and Ms Nokes’ relationship on Twitter. In April last year they openly declared “war” on Ms Nokes and Mr Yalland in a tweet.

&gt; Such was the barrage of vindictive tweets that in June the official F4J account was suspended by the website and Matt O’Connor’s was closed completely. 

&gt; A private detective has told The Independent that Ms O’Connor called him up at the start of this year to enquire about surveillance costs and vehicle tracking of “a Tory MP”. He said “[Ms O’Connor] was ranting immediately and asking if we had any affiliation with the Tory party. She started talking about surveillance costs and vehicle tracking.”

&gt; There were several coincidences that raised Ms Nokes’ suspicion of a tracker, she says. One of these was in June when, while visiting a school and deliberately not posting anything on the internet about her whereabouts, Matt O’Connor, protesting outside her office, was heard by her staff saying over a loudhailer: “We know she’s in Eastleigh.”

&gt; Former F4J member Paul Triggs told The Independent that the surveillance was part of a bigger plan. “Matt O’Connor was planning to put activists on the roof of Caroline Noakes’ house and had her private address watched for several weeks,” he said.

That is a 3.5pint of milk, not 4 pint like advertised. (No. of pints / 1.7598 = Litres)

So [*2L*][1] * 1.7598 = 3.5196 pints.

I bet they are trying to make customers used to 2L as the new standard they should judge Morrisons' milk prices as. Cravendale sold at many newsagents try to do the same thing too. Its typically sold at £1.09 or so because people think it's 4 pints (2.27L) when its really 2L.

The page is [now archived][2]. Possibly this is false advertising because the ""Semi-Skimmed-Milk-4-Pints"" URL and it saying ""Meadow Park Semi Skimmed Milk 4 Pints 2L"" on the page when it is clearly not 4 pints. Maybe they want to capture any ""Milk 4 Pints"" results in search engines...

Under [CAP False Advertising Rules][3], it may fall fowl to:

&gt; 3.2    Obvious exaggerations (“puffery”) and claims that the average consumer who sees the marketing communication is unlikely to take literally are allowed provided they do not materially mislead.


&gt; 3.11    Marketing communications must not mislead consumers by exaggerating the capability or performance of a product.


&gt; 3.17    Price statements must not mislead by omission, undue emphasis or distortion. They must relate to the product featured in the marketing communication.


&gt; The ASA will consider unqualified superlative claims as comparative claims against all competing products. Superiority claims must be supported by evidence unless they are obvious puffery (that is, claims that consumers are unlikely to take literally). Objective superiority claims must make clear the aspect of the product or the marketer’s performance that is claimed to be superior.

I want to see a decrease in immigration that UKIP will give but it's an emotional desire not a logical one. I have plenty of views like it so I'll definitely feel conflicted at the next general. The problem is, my family are a bunch of staunch tory voters. Not because voting Conservative is actually does them any good, but because my Grandfather (and arguably the patriarch of the family) has been a lifelong Conservative councillor. Everybody tacked off him and that's how it was. The two of us who have been to university are to an extent Labour voters because it benefits students on the whole.

I understand that Labour and UKIP are largely opposite ends of the political spectrum but that's where my annoyance with the current system comes in. I can't have preference, I only get 1 vote and that's it, so I have to decide for whom my vote will be most useful. I may agree with everything an independent says, but voting him/her in is a useless vote, nothing will change, so I have to vote for someone else in order to prevent my least favourite party getting into power. My views are not accurately portrayed in my vote and it certainly isn't democratic.

Not at all, though. Because in /r/tumblrinaction you get screenshots of some awkward 15 year-old girl's written fantasy blog of being a dragon or something, and then somehow from that you get a big circlejerk in the comments about how stupid le social justice is.

In /r/tumblrinaction, feminism gets slandered by having all sorts of extra stuff attached to it. Transgender stuff, for example, is *not* feminism - that's LGBT. ""Body acceptance"" *could* overlap with feminism but only in certain contexts - and to be honest, ""body acceptance"" is hardly some kind of big social justice theory which warrants attention. ""Otherkin"" literally has nothing whatsoever to do with feminism, and I am actually certain that *all* of the ""otherkin"" stuff I have seen posted there is fake/satire.

This isn't a matter of ""no true scotsman"", it's a matter of /r/tumblrinaction either making shit up, or cherry-picking random stuff, and falsely associating it to feminism.

She sees one of the children standing at the trough, obviously having trouble with his zipper.

She quickly goes over, and gives the young boy a hand. As she's helping the boy out, the boy acquires a man sized erection which grows in her hand.

She exclaims, ""Which class are you in!?""

Guess who isn't paying for that service currently? Students, children, benefits claimants, pensioners - want to cut them off too (since we're talking net contribution)?

I would start at 2005 reboot with ""Rose"" that said season 1 has some... rough episodes. I actually watched the show when it first came back and... ended up quiting a few episodes in. It wasn't until I caught reruns a few years later that I went back and go hooked. 

Really it depends on what you liike:

You are ok with campiness and bad cgi, and you like show's that have interesting concepts with a lot of heart: start with 2005 reboot with the 9th Doctor

You want something light and fun but a little bit cerebral: Start at season 5 of the reboot with the begining of the 11th Doctor.

You don't have time for option 1 or you don't like the first episode of season 5: Start at this season, this is season 8 and the first episode is Deep Breath. Brand new Doctor and a big shift in tone from the previous incarnation. 

You are an insane completionist: Start with the First Doctor in 1963, first episode is ""Unearthly Child"" 

If you want to go back to the older stuff, I really recommend watching the 4th Doctor. Something about his portrayl has left a long shadow over the show and he is perhaps the most iconic Doctor. Go here if you have a good amount of patience as things are more slowly paced but its a lot of fun, philosophy and adventure with an imposing cosmic hobo. 

The strength of the show is its ability to change. It changes from companion to companion, Doctor to Doctor, season to season, and varies wildly in tone and quality from episode to episode. That means that even if you don't like ALL of Doctor Who, you are almost sure to like some of it a lot and really dislike some of it as well too.",0,1412953155,null,0,false,0,cl5pbu5,t3_2iu8ht,t1_cl5pbu5,t1_cl5j2fw,null,1426593843,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Bury the body at your house: If you’re worried of being caught red-handed out there in the real world, use your own property to bury the body. That backyard rose garden is a perfect place to hide a body (bonus: human bodies make great fertilizer – those roses are gonna look great when spring comes around next year). 



Use acid to dispose of the body: you can get rid of the remains altogether by dissolving it. Be sure to place the body in a container that the acid can’t eat through. After neutralizing the acid, ideas for getting rid of the sludgy remains of the body include flushing it down the toilet.

JUST DONT USE THE ACID IN THE BATH its 101 stupid murdering... thats how you get caught.

step 4: With the fluids drained, cut open the body in a capital I fashion from the tom of the chest to the waist. the 'scar' should form a capital I.

Step 5: Use pliers or a hammer to break the ribcage. pull it apart. prepare 4-5 industrial grade plastic bags. use a sharp implement to cut out the organs in the ribcage. Do the same with the intestines and colon. fill the bags with organs. put those in a hermetic container (beer cooler). Protip: while all fluids will have been drained, the odor will be quite noxious. have a gas mask handy.

Step 6: Dismember the body using an industrial-grade saw, or a surgeon's bone saw. if noise is of no concern, a woodcutter's axe will do. Don't try to do this with a kitche knife. Sinew is pretty tough to cleave.


Step 7: Separate the body into 7-8 bags. torso, 2 arms, 2 legs, head, organs. fit those bags in your car. wait until 1:00 AM and 2:00 PM. head out into a country road.


Step 8: bury the limbs at 4-5 different location, in holes deeper than 5 feet. use hermetic containers to fool any potential trained dogs. Burn the organs into a huge pyre""",0,1412953574,null,0,false,0,cl5pj4j,t3_2iuyu9,t1_cl5pj4j,t3_2iuyu9,null,1426593748,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Sounds pretty reasonable given the current actions of Russia, the increasing rhetoric from Argentina about the Falklands (which we're in no position to re-take if the current defences fail) and the prospect of a hardline Islamist state on the Mediterranean.

&gt; leave the EU

There's solid arguments for both leaving and staying, to not consult the people on it when the last referendum had nothing to do with a political union makes the current situation a complete *diktat* and I think it is the democratic duty of *both* sides to demand a referendum.

&gt; leave the ECHR without even negotiating

Good, it's a complete crock of shit that's beyond helping and makes a mockery of genuine human rights.

&gt;abolish inheritance tax (the fairest tax)

How?

&gt;oppose same sex marriages

Personally I think they should just give *everyone* civil partnerships regardless of orientation and make marriage a matter purely for religions but that would mean stopping the headlines that push the latest unpalatable things the government are up to off the front page.

&gt;deny climate change

That's something they really need to get their shit together on though I do sympathise with the idea that lowering our quality of life to prevent climate change is pointless when you have countries like China that belch out thousands of times more CO2 than us while the international community is powerless to stop them. Also trying to make renewables the main source of power is the UK is pissing in the wind until we have the technology to store the energy in a meaningful way.

Another policy they'll be forced to change if they want to appeal to disaffected labour voters.

Pot 1 is the people who politely answer your questions (which are always along the lines of: Are you planning on voting? Who will you vote for? Did you vote last time? Who did you vote for last time?). These conversations are over in about 60 seconds and the person looks grateful you didn't waste their time.

Pot 2 is the people who want nothing to do with you. Sometimes they are polite enough to just decline your offer to answer questions, sometimes you get swore at and sometimes they pretend not to be in (despite the fact you can see them through the frosted glass window).

Pot 3 are the people who actually want to talk politics. This can be because they either want to be engaged with the system or it could simply be because they enjoy a good argument. These conversations if not handled properly can take a long time to finish.

When you're running a campaign and you know you've got to knock on about 40,000 doors multiple times to ensure you actually get a good contact rate over a large area and you've only got a team of 10-20 volunteers, half of which will be old, you can't afford the people in pot 3 to slow you down. Even if you have 20 people and you speak to everyone the second time you knock on a door, that means you need to knock on 4,000 doors *each*. If you say 5 minutes a door that means people have to donate 333 hours of their time *each*. 

Now in the ideal world you actually spread this out over the time between elections, which means even if everyone does 6 hours per week knocking doors that means after the first time they knock on your door you wont see them again until the next general election.

It's funny because it's a self fulfilling prophecy: People don't volunteer their time which means political campaigning is pretty much about how well you utilise a small resource to generate the best electoral performance. The most efficient way is to narrow down your efforts on small groups of voters in sprints before the election, which leaves people being disengaged, and when they are disengaged they don't volunteer...

As for MPs having worked with a few and spoke to a lot of them (Labour only though really) I have to say your MP is either a great constituency MP, a rising star or the party, or stuck in limbo.

There are benefits to having an MP who is an important member of the government (for example, they can pull more strings and are keen to solve constituency problems as it's more scandalous if there's a problem in their constituency when they are important) and there are benefits to having an MP who is in the constituency a lot doing work (they can't achieve as much but they do more work).  The useless ones are the ones who don't spend enough time in London to further their career but also don't spend enough time at ""home"" to be useful.

Also finally remember if your seat is a marginal seat it's likely the candidate wont get picked until the run up until the election. Any marginal seat candidates that perform well get shipped off to safer seats so there's a lot of turnover as it were.

I remember ranting about the other day after about my 6th pint (ie. where I get overly talkie) in relation to Warehouse 13. Now, if you haven't watched it.. It is a shitty (but kinda watchable for a while) Sci-Fi based on the SCP-Wiki. Being a big SCP nerd, I started watching it before getting pissed off.

It is set in 'Murica, in a warehouse where the governments of the world store mystical artefacts that have superpowers. Obviously we are dealing with crazy outlandish themes, so the crazy and outlandish things that happen were all well and good. What got me though was the fact that this warehouse, that stored endless Doomsday Devices was staffed by about 3 incompetent idiots.

As soon as I realised that 99% of the issues that come up could have been stopped if they chucked this shit in the Iron Mountain- the series was done for me.

The problem with this is that it is very personal. Some flaws require a certain level of intelligence to work out, some are a personal response to storytelling tropes that are tough to pin down... Therefore telling someone they are wrong for having an opinion about an artistic work is nothing but arrogance. 

Do you need a PHD to pick holes? Certainly not... But I think a big issue is that people will now go into films trying to find plot-holes, rather than just getting lost in the storytelling; and that is pretty sad.

Top players: 

Hugo Lloris (GK)- Top 5 keepers in the world IMO, maybe even top 3. Has been absolute class this year

Christian Eriksen (Midfielder)- Our best player last year after getting him for relatively cheap. Great free kick taker and passer.

Erik Lamela (Winger)- One of our biggest signings last year, however missed basically the entire year due to nagging injuries. This year he's been class and has the potential to become one of the most dangerous Wingers in the prem.

Etienne Capoue (Holding Mid)- Other than Lloris he has been our best player so far this year. He is the definition of rock solid

One thing to note is that last year we sold Gareth Bale (one of the best attackers in the world) to Real Madrid and have bought the following players with that money: Lamela, Soldado, Paulinho, Chiriches, Capoue, Chadli.

Doubts about climate change

&gt;There is little argument that CO2
is a greenhouse gas, but
there remains considerable doubt over the sensitivity of climate to atmospheric CO2
. There
has now been no significant climate change for nearly two decades, which argues for a
much lower sensitivity than the IPCC uses. Many scientists believe that the sun is more
important than CO2in determining global climate – and the Sun seems to be entering a
quiet phase.

&gt;UKIP believes that the small changes we have seen in global temperatures in the last
century (+0.7C) are entirely consistent with well-understood, long-term, natural climate
cycles.

UKIP are a political party. They are not scientists. They do not have the credentials to deny climate change is happening. If they chose to willfully ignore the massive scientific consensus then they are idiots.

If you don't want to stop climate change as a governmental body you are denying it exists and it is **the** major problem facing the world. ",0,1412956469,null,0,false,0,cl5r2ce,t3_2iugt2,t1_cl5r2ce,t1_cl5qpfq,null,1426593032,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The reason we aren't caught up in the technicalities of technology during star wars is because it's a fantasy which is driven morely by the sets and characters as opposed to the science behind their technology.  

I really like your last paragraph.  I don't actively look for plot holes/goofs while watching a show/film because it just makes the whole experience less fun.  If the plot is sound, the writing is good, it's easier to immerse yourself to the point where you don't care that there are fires in space.  

I'm sure there are many examples of good movies that are terrible in regards of accuracy but are still entertaining.  The one at the top of my head is probably gladiator, even with it's huge inaccuracies, is still a fantastic film.

It doesn't, but unfortunately it is the case currently and not sure what the best/easiest way to change this is. While Monsato isn't *every* GM company, it is one of the biggest and that's an issue. 

&gt;I don't think that you can make the argument that agricultural technology hasn't delivered a net benefit in terms of feeding numbers of people.

True, and I'm not dismissing it, but just saying we shouldn't be so quick to dismiss local farming knowledge, especially in extreme conditions, where monoculture farming isn't the best fit. 

As for your latter point - the issue is that with countries that are poor and starving, a lot of the food is exported. Something like 80% of the rice grown in Senegal is exported to the middle east - so the situation is that the poor and starving grow the food, only for it to be shipped to the US or developed countries.

As you say, sending it all back again isn't a good idea, but what does need to be highlighted more  in media is the current situation of export imbalance for these farmers For example, previously self sufficient communities are being displaced by TNCs that buy land that local people have very little access to the legal framework or rights to challenge these companies - the fact they've been there for 200 years just doesn't mean that much to a company. The company then promises jobs to the farmers, who then are working on the land they once owned, and all that food is being exported rather than being kept locally.

It falls into an exposition trap countless times (pretty much the whole backstory is dished out in monologues), the scenarios and set-pieces are preposterous and there are many plotholes; but the characters are so believable, and the plotholes are so well glossed over that pretty much everyone who watched it got utterly lost in the surrounding brilliance or originality. 

There is a reason why it only got about 4 Oscar nominations (in Explodey, Soundey, Looks awesomey categories), yet was many peoples film of the year... Looking at it with a critical eye (as The Academy will do) makes it a bit less special. 

It was just fucking smart as hell in my opinion, the Wachowski brothers knew where the problems were- and minimised them as much as possible so the suspension of disbelief wasn't lost, and will go down as one of the greatest films of the era because of this. 

On the other hand you have a film that tried to do the opposite in The Purge. They had what was potentially an astonishingly interesting premise that if done right certainly could have rivaled the premise for The Matrix.. but they tried to make a fundamentally sound film that would score well in film school.. But that made it pretty crap as we got nothing of the 'why' this happened, which (to me anyway) could have been a very compelling story; I just really couldn't give a shit though the way it was made, so never got lost in it in the first place.

&gt;We analyze the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in the peer-reviewed
scientific literature, examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics ‘global climate
change’ or ‘global warming’. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed
AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing
a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second
phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of
self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW,
97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors’ self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements
among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. **Our analysis indicates that
the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.**

Donovan played the first 60minutes  or so in a blizzard, ran his bollocks off and looked half decent. Over the next few weeks he improved no end, scored a couple of goals (probably partially to do with regaining fitness since he was parachuted into the middle of a premier league campaign during his ""off season"") and I was sad to see him go when his first loan ended. 

If he had joined us on a permanent deal that summer, I think he would have had a pretty decent career at Everton. He really fitted the Moyes mould of being a decent footballer who was still prepared to work hard.

As it was, he didn't join. Whilst he still came back for a second stint he wasn't the same by then. Perhaps he'd lost a slight turn of pace, perhaps he wasn't actually as good as I'd remembered. Either way, I still have a fond memory of his time here. 

Plus he was better than Fucking Preki.

They probably introduced this because A. The competition wasn't competing and B. The amount of data being consumed is growing, and this is one way to reduce the data usage. Hopefully 4G will solve this issue temporarily as 3G's life is over and 4G's has just begun, and it can carry a lot more bandwidth.

Also Three's data speeds are pretty good, they have always been reliable for me and their coverage is actually 2nd best in the UK, only slightly behind EE whereas O2 and Vodaphone are quite behind EE and Three.

false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,"I'm not sure there are any good estimates. The problem is the ""Unknown unknowns"".

The NHS does have cross billing agreements with a number of countries, and will try to recoup costs privately from overseas visitors from beyond that list. So, if a trust knows a patient is ineligible for NHS funded treatment, then they will have to recoup the cost privately or via one of the agreed reciprocal agreements.  Estimates for unrecoverable debt vary; raptor_attacks has presented a reasonable example of one (see below).

The problem is patients who are not known to be ineligible, and also to an extent patients who are eligible but have travelled to the UK specifically to become eligible. 

For example, one eligibility criterion for NHS funding is that your  ""usual residence"" is in the UK. In other words if you are living at a UK address at the time of treatment (and not just a temporary visitor), you are covered, almost regardless of anything else. Similarly, if you are enrolled at a UK educational establishment, or employed by a UK company, then you are also eligible. 

I worked in West London for a while, and used to see this a lot. An ex-pat (to the UK) family would get word that a relative had become unwell back home. The family would arrange for them to get on a flight to Heathrow. They'd get off the plane at Heathrow and get taken straight to hospital, booked in as living with the family as their normal residence, and this would almost invariably go through as ""NHS funding eligible"" with no questions asked.

I've seen similar things when I worked in Yorkshire doing respiratory clinics (huge numbers of new immigrants with raging tuberculosis), but eligible for NHS treatment under one rule or other.

I would be keen to work on a script that everyone agrees to, and so I propose we get together for a pitch meeting. Anyone who attends can bring a pitch; whether it is a fully formed, ready-written script, or just an idea that needs development. 

Leave a comment and let me know what it is you can contribute (in front or behind the camera).

How on earth do you enforce this? Remove their passport? What if they can't get a job right out of uni? 

&gt;UKIP will scrap the HS2 project which is uneconomical and unjustified.

Pretty sure this is too far gone to scrap now. The contracts have been signed.

&gt;___Tu quoque___ (/tuːˈkwoʊkwiː/;  [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for ""you, too"" or ""you, also"") or the __appeal to hypocrisy__ is an informal [logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) that intends to discredit the opponent's position by asserting the opponent's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position. It attempts to show that a criticism or objection applies equally to the person making it. This attempts to dismiss opponent's position based on criticism of the opponent's inconsistency and not the position presented.  It is a special case of [ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) fallacy, which is a category of [fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) in which a claim or argument is rejected on the basis of fact about the person presenting or supporting the claim or argument.  To clarify, although the person being attacked might indeed be acting inconsistently or hypocritically, such behavior does not invalidate the position presented.
