true,PTRJK,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Yes and no. I would *like* Scotland to stay, but while the UK is in the EU and Westminster wants to maintain the status quo in regards to devolution, I think it's probably in their best interest to go it alone.

What I don't understand is that there are people wanting to keep the UK together, while wanting to stay in the EU? It sounds like they're trying to have their cake and eat it. The EU will eventually replace the UK entirely (with 'ever closer union') and the UK will simply become four separate European States. We can try to devolve countries in the meantime, but it will just postpone the inevitable. Westminster will become an unnescisery link (or middleman) between its four federalised countries and the federal EU, which is something I think many Scots already see.

We can also try to hold the whole of the EU back from further integration, for our own national interest of 'maintaining reasons for the United Kingdom to exist', but again, it would just postpone the inevitable.

I support the UK becoming more federalised (which Nigel Farage supports) and I think the UK's relationship with Europe should be economic (not political), while letting the continent fully steam ahead with their 'United States of Europe'. Preferably 'Devo-max' for all countries in the UK (including England), while *maybe* joining [EFTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association), whether it's a Swiss style arrangement, Norwegian or our very own. That way, the UK can continue to share an independent currency, military, foreign policy, international free-trade agreements and many British institutions/organisation (UK film council, space agency etc).",0,1399256998,null,0,1399305800,0,ch9qrxt,t3_24qbd0,t1_ch9qrxt,t3_24qbd0,null,1433654019,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Other than Lloris, I think Walker always shows a lot of passion and work rate, but for the most part it's severely lacking. One player who I've seen be surprisingly and impressively vocal is Bentaleb. A player who was at the very least 2 years younger than everyone else on the team, and in a lot of cases much younger, was telling people when they fucked up, leading by example and showing passion and determination.

For reasons that defy all reason they didn't cuff him at the side of the road and leave him there while they took his car away to be crushed.  Or even just ban him.  

He says to me he was in complete control of the vehicle and the conditions were dry and that it was entirely safe.  He thinks that he's awfully unlucky that on the only two occasions he's gone over the limit to that degree *(that he spoke about)* he got caught.  Albeit without any consequences whatsoever.  He doesn't see it as practically miraculous that having been so stupid and getting caught he got away with it, or that the easiest way not to get caught speeding is to stay within the damned speed limit.

Huhne is displaying the same sort of arrogant stupidity here:

&gt;Although I was guilty, I justified my denial to myself by saying that it was a relatively minor [and] that prosecutions should be based on facts not fantasy

&gt;. . .

&gt;At that point alarm bells should have been ringing for police and prosecutors. They should have ditched her, because they had only gone to her in the first place because of what appeared in the Mail on Sunday.

It's not a rational response.  It's certainly not a helpful response.  It's purely a snarling, rage-fuelled emotional response.  And it's not like any of this was particularly personal to me.  It was just something happening when I was a kid.

I can see that it would almost certainly cause more harm than good to prosecute him, even if they had cast iron evidence.  I suspect that even if the police had good evidence and they pursued this with all the fervour that justified they would be pulled off the case and the investigation would just go away.

For an example of a real effect on election outcome [here is a recent by-election(http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2014/griffith/result.htm). Notice how the conservatives would win in FPTP with the highest first-preference share of 44.4% compared to 38.6% for Labor, where the Greens have 'stolen' 9.8% of the left vote. But with AV or preferential voting those Greens first preferences are transferred to their second preferred candidate in Labor. You can see the final result at the end where it came down to a two-candidate contest of 51.8% Labor to 48.2% Conservative.

The big difference is it allows voters to show their true preferences while still having their final vote go to their strategic choice. It also impacts public funding of elections, with public money be dispensed after the election according to first-preferences.

No, we might not win on goal difference but the season isn't over. No-one expected what happened in the Sunderland game - it's all a matter of how the cookie crumbles. 

City will definitely be pressured...the title is theirs to *lose*. We have the support of not just the fans, but rival clubs - we can do this. YNWA!",0,1399273611,null,0,false,0,ch9w8gk,t3_24r28q,t1_ch9w8gk,t1_ch9vplt,null,1433656657,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,AdrianBlake,cnty-uk,Yorkshireman living in Dorset,"Well firstly, not for the 9 billion expected by 2050, and not everywhere. The only reason we havent had a malthusian catastrophy yet (wiki it, Basically running out of food for population so then wars for farms etc erupt and extreme dawinism returns to humans) is because of industrial revolution and the green revolution. We now need the GM revolution.

Also GM is more than just increasing yields. We are making crops pest resistant so we dont need to spray our crops with (carcenogenic) pesticides that wipe out whole ecosystems and species of inverts.  
We are also making crops that are drought or flood resistant so that famines occur less often. 
Also, there are a lot of people in thr world who have enough to eat but are still malnurished because their diet is primarily a single staple crop which is low in vitamins.  Well golden rice and others mean that people dont go blind and their kids grow up properly with full mental and physical capacity. 

Also we now make a type of banana that can be processed into a vaccine (I think hepetitis... cant remember), so we can grow large numbers of vaccines and complex chemicals we need instead of using expensive sythesisers.

So whilst we do need to increase yields (and hopefully without turning huge swathes of wild habitat into farms) we also need to make sure countries with increasingly stochastic weather dont have huge famines like we've seen happen, that poor people get enough nutrients, and that we can continue to make cheap drugs and vaccines available.

GM is needed for all those reasons. I hope you'll come on board.",0,1399273758,null,0,false,0,ch9w9il,t3_24orgt,t1_ch9w9il,t1_ch9popu,null,1433656672,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,slothrr,null,null,"His form has dipped noticeably in the last month or two. However, I for one have really taken to him.

He's played right-back all season despite this not being his proper position. He has two quick feet, good touch and his passing is generally excellent. Combined with his height he makes good interceptions and can nick the ball off opponents well. His defensive weaknesses are positioning and marking, but we have to remember he is not a specialist fullback by training.

Mentally he is very strong. He reads the game well, understands his role and when he gets past the halfway line he is always positive and looking to make things happen. He has a very good engine and is also busy making himself available. One skill that would really lift his game would be to improve his crossing. Another frustrating habit is the outside of the foot cross - which often makes him look sloppy. A positive spin would be that this shows he is at least imaginative and confident in his game.

He has become something of a boo-boy for fans in recent matches, who point to his lack of defensive solidity (something Stoke fans are very used to seeing) and the gulf between what he wants to produce and what he actually produces in the final third. 

I'm not sure that Mark Hughes is entirely confident in him, and we may well see a proper right-back come in during the summer. If this happens, I hope that Cameron is given a chance elsewhere on the pitch - likely defensive midfield - because he has a lot to offer and I think it's only fair to judge a player in what they believe is there best position.

You are taking out a huge loan, at x% interest, then dumping it all into one investment that is highly illiquid and requires maintenance, taxes, and other fees.

I live in Dubai, but yesterday I put together this spreadsheet to run the numbers on buying vs renting a place:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12iA815QK1cXA8WinBvHH0vEZAxDfilo_8svGBbbuccQ/edit?usp=sharing

The core problem is you have so much in one investment and you are very leveraged.

Whilst prices go up, you benefit a lot from the leveraged increases, but also if the prices were to fall or to remain stagnant, then you have large leveraged losses.

* I am more than happy to rent and pump my money into a broad market portfolio of stocks and bonds.  
* I can liquidate them at any time, with no fees  
* There are very minimal annual fees.  
* I don't have to tie up a lump sum (like a house deposit)

.

* If something breaks in my apartment, I don't have to worry about fixing it.  
* If I want to move, I can move with 1 months notice.  
* My landlord has to give me 12months eviction notice, which I can dispute anyway.
* Rent can only go up within legal boundaries, within legal guidelines.

There is no way I would borrow $350k from a bank at 6% p.a and stick that into an investment portfolio, no matter how well diversified my portfolio was.

So why I would do borrow $350k at 6% and dump it all into one highly illiquid and non diversified investment with a plethora of fees.. is beyond me.

A buy to let property is, IMO, a poor investment choice and is riddled with dangers and fees.

Right or wrong they believe we need to reduce pollution as quick as possible and it's much easier and quicker to do that through other renewables that aren't nuclear.

Not to mention aren't pretty much all new nuclear builds being done around Europe at the moment are pretty wildly over budget and behind schedule.

I'm pro nuclear but I do wonder if it's too late to build it on a huge scale - I think France got in at the right time. Like you say what happens if a couple of years into the lifetime of a plant there are huge steps made in renewable energies? With Germany going all out for renewables now it doesn't seem that farfetched that something like that could happen.

Chances are your friend will be getting a summons in the next few months after which he will be spending the next six months to a year without a licence.  And an SP30 endorsement.

As it was I ended up in court a few months later explaining to the magistrates that I'd left my brain in my toolbox, and had a lapse of judgement on a new bike.

The sky would fall. Scotland would be as bad as Greece simply for being independent, as opposed to defaulting on its debts a la sturgeon and having an incredibly poor thought out currency. No, no, to these people the very act of independence will send this country into anarchy. They ignore the huge and growing political gulf between Scottish and English politics. They ignore the fact that the people of Scotland don't like being spied on, dragged into ridiculous bullshit wars for corporate gain. They ignore the fact that Westminster essentially cares about London and that's really about it. Many of their arguments beyond what I have mentioned above in my criticism of the SNP are purely emotional and often completely meaningless. What of the BBC? How can you possibly keep the Queen as your Head of State like Australia, New Zealand and Canada!? The Union has stood 300 years so that automatically means it must be working perfectly fine! Why change it you ungrateful Jock gits you'd be as worse off as the Micks if it wasn't for this Union. They strongly infer that places like Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and so on are in such a sorry state simply because they're independent when the truth is so utterly different and more complicated than that.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; Isn't there also a danger that Scotland won't be allowed to join the EU?

Absolutely not - this is just anti-independence scaremongering.

First, bear in mind that, in the event of a ""yes"" vote, Scotland would not become independent overnight.

It's certainly possible that Scotland would not become an EU member automatically and immediately, but look at how readily the EU has accepted membership of its eastern states - Poland, Lithuania &amp;c (2004), then Romania and Bulgaria (2007), then courting Ukraine (c.f. current crisis). 

There's no way that the EU would turn its back and deny membership to a peaceful, civilised country that was an existing member until it exercising its right to [self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination) - a right which the EU is a staunch and vehement defender. [[1](http://www.eu-un.europa.eu/articles/en/article_6499_en.htm), [2](http://www.eu-un.europa.eu/articles/en/article_338_en.htm), [3](http://www.eu-un.europa.eu/articles/en/article_5398_en.htm)] Apart from anything else, doing so would set a terrible precedent.

So assuming that Scotland weren't to get automatic membership of the EU, it would have an agreed fast-track plan for membership before its even independent - sign the independence document with rUK, dot the i's, cross the t's and guaranteed EU membership in 2 or 3 years.

I am trying to find a three bed for myself, wife and two kids. I work near fleet in Hampshire and no way we can afford to buy here. We need a 50 grand deposit and are looking at around 350-400k. In order to find somewhere more affordable we are now looking at Andover to Southampton with the idea that i do a lengthy commute. Even down that way a house is around 200 to 250k.

We are currently living in a 2 bed shoebox which costs us over 10 grand a year in rent. This house in a development made around 10 years ago, and is owned by the same 50+ aged landlord who owns five other rentals on the same close. He has an agent look after everything and spends most of his time living it up at a condo in the florida keys.

I know that people are much worse off then me, and so i am grateful there, but the thing is we are a typical professional working family with a good income (i get paid well as a solutions architect in enterprise IT). If we are struggling to get on the ladder, then there most be a lot more who have no chance in hell.

Interesting observation; I was in a Barrat office, when i heard a sales lady discussing a list over the phone with a colleague. They have these lists where people queue up for houses not even built yet. Some of the names were like Ling Yen Chun or Shen Yip. Turns out Barrat homes have offices in Bejing and Hong Kong. They are selling new homes in the suburbs to Chinese and Singaporian investors.

I am now disilusioned about getting on. It seems the market is going to be top heavy soon. A lot of people could not afford their own houses now if they were to try and buy at todays prices. This means they won't be able to afford to move up.

The bank of england governor said the housing market is a red light on the dashboard. I think what he is saying is that unless its allowed to correct and prices come down its going to crash.

IMO you have to look at Martinez's signings in two groups - the cheap ones that he brought from Wigan and the ones he bought for the first team. Kone and Alcaraz are senior players that had played under Martinez before, and Alcaraz was free. I think part of the reason he chose them was because they already knew how to play his style and therefore were safe choices for squad players. He bought Joel because he sees potential in him.

Well when Lucas went down boy was it a blessing in disguise. Coutinho took over what is technically a CM position, although it's so fluid you could hardly limit it to that, and made it his own. Not for the occasional brilliant pass or silky run, but for his relentless pressing. Pressing that had been missing prior to his reintroduction into the first 11 towards the end of December/early January.

All I can say now is wow. The lad has demonstrated the one asset that has the ability to catapult the truly skilled footballers amongst us: workrate. 

The kid has a lot of things to work on. His shooting, his decision making, and even his ability to go long stretches without making much of an impact, but I now have confidence he can make those improvements because he's shown his willingness to work.

As a black child starting school in 1985 I can't help but wonder what happened to all his bold predictions and fearmongering. 

Despite being the child of pidgin speaking immigrants the nuances of the English language still managed to permeate my thick black skull, much to the chagrin of the author and his supporters. In fact the most maligned group in his essay, the Asian student, has gone on to great success in British education in the 30 years since this articles first publishing. Almost as if the fears raised within were unfounded.

This is the problem I have with the right. A distinct lack historical acumen, while at the same time ironically banging the drum of historical preservation. Immigrants have been coming to these isles since, oh, I don't know, the Beaker cultures of 2,000 BC. The notion that any given group will irreversibly change the very make up of the nation seems to fly in the face of the fact groups have been changing the very face of the nation for several thousand years already. It's just that the most recent groups seem to have higher melanin content than their European brethren, but this is *totally* not a race thing...it's about culture!

You can't take some disquisition from 30 years ago that paints a bleak picture yet ultimately fell short of the horrors it painted and recycle it every few years while shouting about it being hyper relevant.

true,slippyg,null,null,"Have spent most of my working life working with the homeless so won't be providing any empirical data but do have a hell of a lot of anecdotal experience.

Please do not give rough sleepers/homeless food or money. Please ring street link when you find someone you think needs assistance www.streetlink.org.uk - there is an iPhone app, a web form and a phone number 0800 500 0914 I can't vouch for the rest of the country but we act on all of our calls.

I work in a medium sized city in the UK, I am fairly confident in saying that I am aware of each rough sleeper and their circumstances, we can find them all shelter, it might be a camp bed in a hostel office or out of area, but we can find them somewhere. The major problem is getting people to come in and see us, or speak to us when we are out and about. We can give food parcels, showers, bus tickets, train tickets, pretty much anything if people come and see us, but they don't. We have people from homeless services go out and try and find people sleeping rough at 3-5am each week but budget cuts have hit us hard and we don't have the staff to do this as often as we would like, we do act on every single report we get through streetlink though and we can even give you a call back explaining what action we took as a follow up.

So why don't they come and see us for these things? Because unfortunately it's a very tourist heavy city, people here are making over £100 in some cases just sleeping on a bench near the train station, not even asking for stuff. Their food, clothes, tents etc. are all donated so the money that they do not have to budget around is fuelled primarily into drink or drugs. Which is probably an unpopular opinion but the sad fact is that almost all of our homeless are misusing drink or drugs. If I extend this into mental health, I can safely say that all of our street homeless are using drink, drugs or have mentally ill health. We rely entirely on people realising that this cycle is shitty and that they need some help. I can be safe in the knowledge when I tell you that some people, if they could, would just use for the rest of their days, they will never hit that point where they realise ""actually this is shit I want some help"" I can also tell you that some of our most prolific beggars/homeless do have tenancies and I'm not talking about hostel beds, I mean a proper council tenancy.

There is no real evidence he can pull this form off again or do well in Europe. This was his first real showing in the prem, Stewart Downing scored more goals for us last year then he did for Southampton and people wanted Downing gone like he had the plague.

I get the feeling people are living a bit too much in the here and now, the last time we took a punt on an English player after they had one good season we spent £35 mill on Andy Carroll, now people are thinking about Lallana for another big price tags. Unlike Carroll however Lallana isn't young and doesn't have time to get better.

I wouldn't be against him joining but i think a reasonable price tag would be more like £12 million which Southampton would never accept.

Not inane cost of living?  False false false. I'm Canadian, I've lived in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Montreal and on Vancouver island. The only place that might be remotely cheapish to live is Montreal (unless you make a lot of money-poor and/or students live well). I currently live in London and the cost of living here is much cheaper. Food is infinitely cheaper than in Canada. Transit is around the same price for 10X better service. I get paid more here for easier jobs than I did in Canada. Rent here is the same as the rent in any major Canadian city. You have way more cheaper clothing options (primark etc). Honestly I live much better in London than I have in any major city in Canada. Yes I'm a 20 minute train ride out from central London (Bromley) BUT living in every Canadian city I usually lived at least 20 minutes from downtown, usually closer to 40 minutes because our transit sucks and we're obsessed with urban sprawl and long commutes.

If a mobster uses his enforcers to ensure that anyone who comes forwards gets killed or beaten up that makes it quite difficult to get enough evidence for a conviction. That doesn't make them innocent. When there are established patronage links and an embedded culture of silence it is evermore difficult to pass the threshold of all reasonable doubt.

In this situation, I would much prefer the Scottish option of 'not proven' rather than 'innocent' to be used.

LAWSUIT!"". 

But the gates foundation has actually got monsanto etc to agree to develop crops for third world nations without cost to the farmers, so they aren't ALL evil. And around the world, most GM researchers in universities are working on unpatented GM crops that can be used by anyone. Golden rice is free for anyone to use and reuse, without any of those year on year costs. Same for many other crops designed to alleviate poverty. In the US + wealthy places, the big cash crops are patented yeh, but thats because people designing cash crops want cash, people designing famine resistant, vitamin filled crops want to stop famines and give people vitamins. Most researchers in the public sector (universities/charities etc) are doing it for the end goal, not cash.

the trial that the Green party member told people to destroy was an unpatented wheat crop designed to reduce the impact of pest species, so increasing yield in pest ridden countries and preventing swarms of pests wiping out crops. It was going to be given out for free after testing. But then they destroyed it. And it cost over a million quid to get to that stage. So... you know.... fuck that


And I should respond to how you're saying that the way we do things now, or simply having diversity protects against drought? Well then why is drought an issue? That's not how it works, especially when what you have is unpredictability, so in many african nations we're seeing unpredictable patterns of flood, then drought then flood then drought.  The fact is that it's pretty hard for evolution to make multiple steps at once since most mutations kill, and if you need lots of mutations to get to a single desired trait, well then you've got a long time of waiting for it to appear, and then somehow finding that individual in a whole wheat field. With GM we can make drought AND flood resistant crops today, by inserting genes already at the final step that we want.

Edit: the flood and drought resistant crops aren't wheat (drought maybe) but the one I read about being both was some sort of root. They also inserted vitamins into it because it's fairly low nutritionally.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As a Villa fan I've been surprised and rather amused at the number of Liverpool fans that think we will cause an upset on Wednesday. I don't think those fans quite understand where we are as a team. Allow me to enlighten you all on where Villa stand. 


Yes, we've taken points off top teams earlier in the season. But right now. We. Are. Woeful. Hull was a welcome surprise because for the last couple of months we've been as bad as I've ever seen us. People say we're strong away from home but we actually have **the worst away form in the entire league** - 1 point from 6 games - and haven't won away since January 1st. A drab point at Cardiff is the only away point we have managed since the 2-2 draw at Anfield.


We're missing several key players through injury and could be without all of the following attacking players on Wednesday: Benteke (Achilles) Kozak (Broken leg) Agbonlahor (came off early with knock vs Hull) Weimann (came off with possible injury vs Hull) Albrighton (came off with possible groin strain vs Hull) N'Zogbia (Achilles) and Helenius (out of favour). That would leave Bowery Holt Robinson and Tonev as our only options on the wing or up front. Not exactly inspiring.


We're also now completely safe after Norwich lost yesterday. Everyone at Villa is in a state of limbo eagerly awaiting Randy Lerner's statement after the final game, in which he is expected to announce the club is up for sale or maybe even has already been sold. Very strong rumours that the potential buyers are very wealthy and know what they are doing when it comes to football.


Even Lambert has said he has no idea if he will be in a job next season with all the uncertainty. So for pretty much everyone associated with Villa, the next 2 games are not particularly important. Hull was our cup final because we had to stay in the league for any possible takeover. Now we'll finish 12th-17th and that position won't really affect our future. It is about the message that follows.

So City need a win at the Etihad, where they demolish most teams, against Villa who have little to play for, completely distracted by stuff off the field, in terrible form and [the longest injury list in the league](http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/epl_injury_table.php).

It's all going to end in tears. House prices are simply rising too fast, income is not keeping up. People will default en masse again, it's a question of when, not if.

True on second point, though one of them major issues is monocultures - so previously food secure areas/communities who have a diversity of farming practises to mitigate against unexpected floods/draughts end up being displaced. The gov't give land away to TNCs from France/Spain/Saudi Arabia etc who then will come in and fence off huge areas of land that these communities were farming on. 

The communities have no official legal representation that they own the land - they've just been there for centuries, but because the government has given away this land there is very little they can do. Because these companies come in and start farming for biofuel/GM/whatever - about 20% of it will go stay in the country, 80% of it exported. Because it's all one crop if that crop fails due to XYZ then suddenly you  have starvation issues. So a previously food secure community, quite literally overnight, becomes food insecure because they then:

* Can't afford to buy the expensive foods that the companies are now producing
* Have no land which to farm and produce crops on
* Local farming knowledge is lost or ignored (when often companies that have worked with communities will actually get better results long-term)
* Suffer from poor crops from the cash-crop companies and just have no food
* Not have enough food because the food they're growing is being exported

I'm not saying this is happening in every case, but it is happening and I'm always surprised by the amount of people that either don't believe me or are unaware. 

I do think we need GM crops but there also needs to be a balance of approaches and a critical view of both sides without just being like ""woo yeah first world can solve everything go us"" which some friends have been like in the past :P. That as well as it pissing me off when people will moan about the price of bread going up by 5p - which they can afford to pay - when the wheat and food crisis in 2008 saw countries fall apart and cities burn.

- Lending into retirement, with insufficient income;
- Interest only lending where no repayment vehicle exists;
- Debt consolidation: transferring unsecured debt onto a mortgage, to reduce monthly costs - which leads to an increase in total interest and risk.

I've had one which was also recorded quite recently. I stopped a motorist because he'd just gone through a red light. I pulled him over on an upwards hill. As I was speaking to him I asked him to get out of the car, he didn't apply the handbrake and used my car as a buffer.

So yes, it's a good general rule that if you can buy immediately after a collapse you can make a lot of money. However that only works if 3 things hold true:

- you can find somewhere safe to hold your money whilst the collapse happens. That's becoming increasingly hard, with even government bonds potentially risky if a collapse is international.

- The banking system survives the collapse. If it doesn't, then things could get very bloody indeed.

- The collapse will be followed by a recovery

It's important to remember that selective breeding also reduces genetic diversity quite a lot, every selection is like a bottleneck. You CAN end up inserting the genes into a bunch of different crops to maximise other gene diversity, I don't know enough about food GM stuff to whether they do that, but you would think they would try? My experience with GM is people in my lab who GM bacteria to create markers and things for parasites. I do easy genetic stuff lol I never GM'd any O myself.

And as for ""First Woooorld, FUCK YEAH!"" a lot of the cool stuff coming out is from the countries that want the GM, so the root I read about that can survive flood or drought and has added vitamins, that's made in Africa and the research is led by a lady who grew up in a place where that was pretty much all they ate, but when crops failed they would have to sell everything to try and buy other foods. And in India, they're sorting their problems out at incredible speed. I guess it's unlikely that some guy in Cambridge is thinking ""Do you know what would help a specific region in Africa I've never been to? Improving that crop I've never heard of to survive conditions I have no concept of!"" So really the more access to education (in terms of womens rights or enough pay/food so they aren't living day to day) that these developing countries get, the more they are able to actually sort themselves out. It's like the old saying, ""Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day, teach a man to splice genes, and he'll revitalise an entire agricultural region"" lol

true,[deleted],null,null,"You may be right that the issues of economy and unemployment are not quite the same (although they are very, very closely related). However, the point remains that Farage's tactic is to unite his voter base against a scapegoat.

As JamesB5446 says, what's needed to keep British nationals in work is a bigger focus on the living wage, so that they are not undercut by immigrants who are prepared to work for abysmal wages (which, by the way, is not exactly an enviable position to be in). Immigrants make a net contribution to the British economy, so all the job market really needs is fairness - not artificial scarcity.

The question of patriotism is a sticky one. Certainly there is plenty to say that Britain is (or was) a 'great nation'. But these things rise from people, not their country, and conflating the two is a propagandist tool that leads to nationalism and jingoism.

&gt;in the past few hundred years we have invented Science itself, democracy, the rule of law, capitalism, and forced this upon a world that was still stuck in 10,000 years BC savagery.

This is just ridiculous. Britain was among the first nations to undergo an industrial revolution. That may account for your claim that we 'invented capitalism'. Most of the rest of your points date back to ancient Greece (at least).

From what I hear (and this is all rumour, obviously) Lallana is a Brendan choice rather than one from the transfer committee. 

As far as Kruse-Lallana goes, it's worth noting that the former has largely played as a striker this season, so they're not a direct comparison. I'd also say Lallana is more physical and is already adjusted to the league; I haven't seen much of Kruse as a midfielder/support forward, but I don't get the feeling he'd fit us as well as Lallana.

The biggest problem for democracy is that we want our politicians to lie to us. Instead of treating them as their own complex individuals, we treat them as parts of a party or someone who agrees with all the same things that we do, each and every one of us. They smile and nod their heads and don't correct us when we say they have no interest in a nice fat pension or having their name go down in the history books, and that all they really care about is that one policy we like.

You can disagree with me, but I see no reason to think UKIP is any less of a dickless politicial group than the Tea Party is in America, and just as corruptible, if not already corrupted in the case of the Tea Party, by lobbyists and more.

Even if they genuinely believe their policies to the point where they would ignore billions of pounds in ""support"" not just for themselves but their party and country. The butt clenching truth is no politician wants to be known as the one who caused an economic implosion in their own country; and the UK leaving the EU could easily be manipulated that way by corporate interests to punish the UKIP party for not doing as they are told. Hell many people in the public are already in fear it would cause such economic anarchy for us with or without the corporations themselves doing anything. The voters would take care of the rest, like the consumer sheeple we all are and UKIP would cease to exist and their political careers forever over :)

In addition, this would force Matic and Luiz to sit back deep to compensate, which leads to a real lack of passing in the middle on offense (where Oscar currently resides). The 4-4-2 is really a thing of antiquity, especially because anyone with a 3 man midfield (either 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3) has an overload through the middle. The reason Atletico Madrid were able to make it work is because 1) Koke and Raul Garcia are absolute monster defenders on the two wings. They get forward, but when they do run forward they don't drift into the middle, they stay towards the wings so they are able to run back quickly. 2) It is a primarily defensive formation. Atletico Madrid don't score a lot of goals by breaking the opponents down, they play a counter-attacking style that wins by virtue of the other teams almost never scoring. So this formation doesn't really fit any of the things we want in breaking down defensively minded bottom teams.

As for overstating the issue, I don't think that's really the case since immigration is a substantial issue in Western European politics these days, especially when it comes to matters of integrating immigrants. Multiculturalism has just led to tensions and really doesn't work, and popular opinion is turning against people on the left to decry any debate about immigration that isn't entirely positive as racist.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, I feel that Lambert is not doing that bad with whats available to him and that calls for his head are at this point in his Villa career premature. 
 
 He has had a very unlucky season, injuries have messed up not only his two main signings this season (Okore and Kozak), but also Benteke his star signing. His signings aren't without fault, but I think with that minuscule a budget, that the bargains that have worked out outweigh the ""bargains"" that don't. If the purse strings are loosened this summer, not only would I be happy and interested to see what Lambert could achieve with it, I feel he has also made a head start in the fact that he has built for us a spine/core set of players cheaply that we don't need to waste money on replacing or improving.

 Whether bringing in new signings that have impressed or bringing players on the fringe back into the midst of the first team Lambert has built a very strong set of players that are only let down by holes in the team that have occurred by various injuries or financial restraints in transfer markets. Realistically I think that with: Guzan, Vlaar, (Okore if he impresses in pre-season), Delph, Westwood, Albrighton, Gabby and Benteke we have a very strong core not to mention other players like Bacuna, Lowton, Weimann and Kozak as key squad players, that can comprise a team that can push into top ten and above team. That list as a first team is not enough, but with a spending spree on experienced, proven players this summer to bolster and improve the first team we will be on the up.

 Lastly Lambert has surely done the job that Lerner expected of him, keep Villa in top flight whilst reducing debt so that he can sell up, if he really wanted anything different he would of done something different after was an admittedly poor January transfer window by Lambert by either promising more funds or firing him then for not reaching expectations. However honestly I feel that all Lerner expects and wanted was for Lambert to keep Villa up whilst he sorted out his sales pitch for the club.

 However I feel even if this whole sale falls through, and we have to carry on scraping our pockets to gamble on cheap players then I still want Lambert to be at the helm, we've gone too far with the plan so far to let someone else rip apart the Villa squad again, especially since this time we won't have some of the remnants of a more expensive team to help us out trouble like at the start of Lambert's term.

Yea you are right though that the greens are not communists and therefore should not be described as that.

In a similar way UKIP should not be labeled as fascist, the BNP maybe.

Firstly while fascism can accommodate racism easily  the two are not synonymous.  Fascism is not democratic, democracy is a leg UKIP is standing on. Fascism attacks conservatism and UKIP are quite conservative. Fascism breaches the right-left spectrum and as a result argues for state control and socialist elements, UKIP IMO are quite right wing.

""Libertarian""y parties like UKIP only really share links to fascism due to favouring the military and being nationalists. The nationalism they show is non-sectarian/non-racially based  so that aspect has little in common with fascism.

A better argument could be made that Labour is fascist than UKIP IMO, but that would be stupid, neither are, nor are they close to being so.

Go on trying to demonise parties like UKIP as fascist if you like, all it does it paint a picture of a political cause with no real understanding of politics. In my opinion if UAF wants to try and demonise, shut out and remove parties on such baseless reasons, then they seem like the anti-democratic, fascist even? people.

- Lending that stretches into retirement with no income assessment;
- Interest only mortgages with no repayment vehicle;
- Frequent consolidation of unsecured debt onto a secured loan.

Customers will no longer be able to do anything other than a simple rate change (sometimes not even this) without receiving advice and going through a full affordability assessment and review of the existing borrowing. There will be some difficult conversations...

Tactically he has been a bit dull, there have been moments of tactical genius i.e. against Cardiff when he put Lowton on, pushed Bacuna up and Bacuna earned and scored a free-kick and again, tactically for the first goal Hull didn't know what was going on. The commentators likened it to his days at Norwich.

He's lost a lot of fans, and I admit I booed at Swansea. It was a miserable day and standing in the wet watching Villa's performance was incredibly frustrating.

So I'm a bit tied, Lambert in or Lambert out. Is he the right man for the job? With investment can he take us forward? Has he done the best job he can with what he's been given.

At the same time, I am sick to death of changing managers, Lambert knows the club and seems to respect the fans.

Then in July of 1972 the Springhill massacre occurred, where a 13 year old girl, a 15 year old boy, a 16 year old boy, a priest and a 39 year old man where murdered.  The 14 year old girl was shot in the face from 40 yards away.  Two 17 year old males were also injuries in the attack.  One shot 6 times in the back and once in the arm, other shot in the back of the head.  What was done in the name of the British State in our country, in nationalist areas was nothing short of murder.

Here's a witness statement from one of those injuries, name has been removed because it's my father and I'd rather not have names published here, annotations in parenthesis are my own:

&gt;' [name removed] described the situation; ‘I was hit on the arm and my mate John Dougal and me ran back towards our house. The Brits kept shooting at us. I was shot again. I was hit a number of times in the back (in total 6, and one in the arm, from a SLR). My mate John was shot and fell to the ground. I managed to get back to our house. My father was looking out through the kitchen window. He ran out to help me into the house. I was bleeding very heavily. My father used a towel to try to stop the bleeding. I was lying on the floor and my father was beside me when our John(my father's brother) came into the living room. I asked him about John Dougal. He told me he was lying in the garden next to ours and he had tried to get to him several times but it was impossible as the shooting was continuous. About half an hour after I was shot our house was packed with people, friends and neighbours. Hearing I was shot they made their way over to see if they could help. At this stage there was a full scale gun-battle raging. I couldn't believe that so many people would risk their own lives to help me. The courage they showed was unbelievable. The gun battle raged so fiercely that an ambulance could not get into our street. My father and some other people who were in our house knocked a hole through the bedroom wall leading into the house next door. I was carried through the hole in the wall into the next-door neighbour's house on a makeshift stretcher. They carried me out into an entry at the back of the bungalows, down the entry and into Whiterock Gardens. I was put into an ambulance and taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital. (The ambulance tried to get into the street, but the army kept firing at it, hence why they had to do this).

Tim doesn't have a clue, the defense just got hammered repeatedly, but they didn't have a whole lot of help.  You can't play with 7 attackers (I include Rose) in the PL!  Siggy and Eriksen in midfield does nothing for defense, and Paulinho just did nothing.  When Lennon is better defensively than Rose, you've got a problem.

It was a gutless performance, but for any of you who have ever played the game, being constantly under attack and totally incapable of finding a little breathing room outside of your half (AGAINST WEST HAM AND BIG SAM!) is frustrating and demoralizing.  Nothing excuses Paulinho and Adebayor's actions, but even the dumbest player has to start realizing eventually that their Manager isn't giving them a chance to win.  

Tim has to go.  I don't know the structure of Ade's wages, but if they increase a penny I'd ship him off to ANY bidder.  And while I'd like to see some passion out of Paulinho, I just don't honestly think we've seen the player he can be.  Bring Caulker back, and relegate Kaboul to the bench.

Selling of these top players have knocked us back as we only replaced  them with free players and loans.

Then we got rid of bates and in came GFH, they spoke a good game but they came in to make a profit and when it wasn't working they racked up debts as they did not want to put their own money in. We were in the play-offs in the new year but then they blocked all transfers pretty much. Then McDermott was ""sacked"" at the end of January and this was the beginning of chaos that tore our season apart. 

GFH were looking to sell but wanted to milk every pound out of the deal. Talks of administration came along with potential owners dropping out. But then Massimo Cellino came along and now we have hope again. 

We ended the season with 3 wins 1 draw and 1 loss with a new hope around the club. The summer will determine where we are for next season. 

We have the fans (30,000 for a pointless final game against Derby on Saturday), the stadium etc, so I believe we can really push on for promotion. McCormack sums it up pretty well in a recent interview. With him being the top scorer premiership teams will be all over him in the summer to bring him in.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; Why are you hell bent on supporting more of them coming here, when we don't currently have enough jobs for everyone who already lives here?

The question shouldn't be 'Why do you want more of them to come here?', it should be 'Why do they come here in the first place?'. 

The answer to the question is wages and quality of life. The majority of migrants come to the UK because they will get higher wages than doing a similar job in their home country, as well as other benefits of living in the UK such as high quality public services. 

Now, the UKIP solution, or the solution of closing the borders and reducing foreign aid, is essentially saying 'I already have a good quality of life, and people who are similar to me have a good quality of life, so I don't care if foreigners don't'. It is the international equivalent of cutting public services to decrease taxes; it overwhelmingly benefits those who have over those who have not, and, to me at least, it seems pretty selfish.

The solution I advocate, and what a lot of socialists advocate, isn't having everyone moving to the UK to get these benefits. It is having more cooperation between different countries and people, so that everyone can have a high quality of life, not just those who had an Empire 100 years ago and are still reaping the benefits of that today. I support levelling the playing field so everyone can get a similar, fair, and good treatment, whether they are rich or poor, Northern or Southern, Western European or Eastern European. 

I'm not sure what I did to deserve the benefits of the UK, and I think we should use the position we are in to help others, not to put up big walls around ourselves and say 'we have ours so tough shit'.

Another problem for the UK is that many foreign workers (skilled and unskilled) are sending much of the money they earn, back to their families in poorer countries and not back into the British economy.

The cops dont like it all. You have to be sure that you dont have grounds for an arrest.

The last time I got searched was in Maida Vale. I got stopped on an estate. Someone had just robbed a bank at gunpoint. The suspect was wearing grey clothes ( I was wearing beige jeans and jacket ) 2 cars pulled up they sprang out. Very agitated on high alert' shouted for me to stop, I did. They then told me why I was being stopped. I said they have to take me in to search me. They are legally obliged to. They put me in cuffs, accused me  of being aggressive, normal routine. I was'nt, never am when interacting with the police. Long story short searched me in the street, due to the suspect wearing similar clothes and seen going in a similar direction.

I asked for a written record, illegible scrawl. I said I was going to make an official complaint. This all happened outside a post office. It happened directly in front of the camera. In the end I let it go. Here's the kicker. I later learned the guy who held up the Bank had Ginger Hair, Mines nearly black. This happened just after this happened.

This is just unrealistic nonsense. You want every country to be on the level of the UK? That is going to take AT LEAST 100/200 years. AT LEAST. In some countries, maybe even 500 years.

We would have to build roads, hospitals, schools, and then put people into those schools.. How the hell are we going to pay for all of that?

Some countries still execute gay people for the ""crime"" of being gay. How would we solve that exactly? 

Again, the answer is time. These things will change in time but it is going to take A LONG TIME. The UK didn't just turn overnight into a stable democracy with rights for women, rights for gays, common law, the NHS, the education system etc. All of that took an extremely long time and is the result of the efforts of countless pioneers over the years. 

And besides, your solution doesn't even make any sense.

&gt;Oh, we have lots of problems in the world. Hmm.. I know how to solve this.. Let's open our borders, and REDUCE the standard of living here! 

How does this make any sense at all? Grow up.

Doing this every year you can add to the ISAs size and roll over your whole amount. See /u/carpii 's comment above and check out Money Saving Expert guide for more comments.

You really can't disagree that facebook is way better for organising events with multiple people, and also I've not seen anyone be mean to anyone ever on the other group.

I am still part of this subreddit too, I don't really post because no one else posts, and yeah that's totally my fault but I always feel like if I did post no one would see it so what's the point! But after seeing this post I feel like perhaps I should make more of an effort to post things here! 

Perhaps we should instead of placing blame on a group of people who are proactive in promoting a group on another social media platform, perhaps we should look at this group and start bloody posting, sometimes the problem is not that there is another group but that the people who post here should just post more.

You could argue that rural urban migration also plays a part, and that a Polish person moving to London is the western equivalent of a Chinese person moving from rural Hunan to Shanghai. In terms of Europe that's probably true. But if we open our borders to, say India or Nigeria, we're just going to get flooded with more people than we can handle. 

It's not a black and white issue, and the solution is probably to support growth in developing countries while allowing for more localized open borders. In an ideal situation I think the average Nigerian would prefer moving to Lagos over London if he/she could do that and achieve the same economic status. The average Indian would probably prefer Mumbai over Paris or Manchester.

Emigrating to another culture is not easy. Free movement of people is a nice ideal but it's easy to underestimate how hard it is to move to a different culture until you've done it yourself.

A  few of those points are kind of...normal, especially the first 3 and number 6.  

Teaching:  

&gt; Other subjects include programming, taught by a lecturer who is so inanimate and robotic it is impossible to follow him. I'm sorry, I've had bad teachers in the past, but this is beyond a joke. After researching the material after the useless lectures I could turn around and teach them better than him. In fact, as a group we often had to go and learn everything off YouTube ourselves and teach ourselves and each other.
Awful teaching is passed off with the excuse that, 'you should be doing independent learning', yet they provide no resources except for textbooks with no illustrations or anything of even the slightest hint of engagement or excitement. These books are quite frankly, shit.  

Although I can see your problem, Uni Lecturers are **not** teachers. They're not even teacher-trained. Of course, it sounds like that tutor could put more effort in, but it's still important to remember what I've just said. They're not teachers. There's a reason why teachers make the joke ""Uni tutors have more subject knowledge than me but they wouldn't last a week at a High School.""  
 

As for the easy work, they are more diagnostic assessments, and you have said you're only in your first year. It will get harder, believe me. For most courses, first year doesn't even count towards your degree. First year is more of a diagnostic year.  

&gt; Lecturers often plug their own books which cost £40+ and are no use anyway.  

Annoying but that's normal.  

It sounds like you're having a bad experience, but remember that you're only in first year.  

A lot of what you said is normal at Uni (a lot of it resonates with my experience at Uni anyway) and some other points do seem like genuine concerns.  

Interestingly, I seem to keep stumbling across major problems from students at top Universities. I know it's anecdotal evidence, but to me it seems that ""lesser"" universities and ex-polytechnics (that are often looked down on) don't seem to have many of those problems. Huddersfield was fantastic. I had a friend with many of your problems who was at Manchester, which is supposed to be bloody good.

We have no large reservoir of natural resources to rely on and while our banking practices are questionable they're not as bad as Switzerland's. Speaking of banking, IIRC its ~25% of our economy? Which isn't really a pleasant place to be nor seemingly that reliable given our last economic crisis.  

&gt; I really don't see why the 6th largest economy in the world can't do the same

Its worth noting however that we are not growing as quickly as some of those nearby. India look set to overtake us and Brazil post growth results that question our long term ability to be 6th.  We're more likely somewhere between 7th and 12th long term.  
Getting excited about 6th is massaging the figures a touch too as we occupy a bracket well below 1st and 2nd (US and China, the US being just under 8 times our GDP), 3rd place Japan is still twice the size of our economy. We're in the third tier which contains countries like Germany, France, UK, Brazil, Italy, Russia, India and Canada (and arguably a few more).

I genuinely don't trust our other key economic partner (aka America) to not totally fuck us over in the long term. In the past (I primarily reference the Anglo-American loan deal) they've demonstrated their ability to fuck us up when we do things they don't like.  

Simply put I trust the EU more than I do the US. Nor do I think we'll do a good job of maintaining our ""economic lead"" over the developing countries for much longer.

As an incentive, corporate taxes can be reduced (as the slippery bastards never pay it anyway), which might spark an interest in more overseas industry.

One player I remember being slightly pissed off with my dad badgering for all the autographs he wanted.

true,jampax84,null,null,"&gt; On the views of Scots being well represented it's a tricky one. I personally think they are better represented than many Scots realise. Bearing in mind of the last 3 prime ministers, one was Scottish and another spent his childhood in Scotland. The problem is, ultimately, that the population of Scotland is very small when compared to the remainder of the UK - and so giving a greater to a minority group is akin to federalizing the UK. Now, Scots might be very keen on that, but I suspect the 85% of the population who live in England might not be so keen to give a minority group a larger stake-holding.
&gt; On the perception of independence being a slight against the English, I think ultimately it is. Whilst its noble to say things like ""we've just grown apart"" what it really means between-the-lines is ""Here in Scotland we like justice, social mobility and fairness. You cunts in England like money, old boys clubs and stealing oil"" i.e the inference is that the Scots are holier-than-thou. I don't see how one group ""emancipating"" themselves from an established relationship can be anything other than a slight against the other, especially since the terms of the separation are not mutual - i.e. the UK's official position is it doesn't want this.

&gt; Speaking of banking, IIRC its ~25% of our economy? Which isn't really a pleasant place to be nor seemingly that reliable given our last economic crisis.

Banking in itself is nothing to be worried about. It's how it is regulated. If it is properly regulated so that loans are not given to people who can't afford to repay them and such, then there's no problems. 

You say that saying were 6th is massaging the figures then you use GDP instead of GDP per capita? The US has a population nearly 6x the size of ours. It's not wonder their economy is that much bigger. They can harness economies of scale to manufacture and produce all sorts on a much larger scale which can explain the discrepancy between 6x population and 8xGDP. Per capita, they're about $10,000 above. Again explainable by economies of scale. Put simply, they have more resources, more people, bigger companies. They can make more of everything for cheaper and more efficiently. 

The same can be applied to China, India, Brazil etc. who are overtaking us. 

&gt; I genuinely don't trust our other key economic partner (aka America) to not totally fuck us over in the long term.

So your argument is basically paranoia that our most trusted ally and single largest trading partner (and we are also one of their largest trading partners) would fuck us over? It's irrational.

&gt; the other strategy which seems to be a lack of long-term economic strategy.

I beg to differ. Leaving the EU and going it alone is the long-term economic strategy. Having our own, independent agreements with many nations across the world is far more long-term than being part of an empirical union which will eventually collapse. It may not be for a hundred years, two hundred years or longer. But it will. If we leave while the going is good, we can negotiate an amicable agreement that all parties are happy with. It will allow us to pursue agreements that will aid our country and be in the interest of us. We won't be part of a messy collapse. We can begin to trade with the up and coming nations (Brazil, India, Turkey, Mexico, Nigeria) while they're still needing trade and are willing to make favourable agreements, rather than being on the other end when they're the bigger economies.

The whole job of a manager is to get the team to work together, and to get the best out of every individual member of that team.  If a player pulls rank, it is a manager's job to pull them back into line and get them working for the team again.  There are numerous ways to do this that don't involve completely ostracising them.

The thing is, it's pretty obvious that Adebayor wasn't just being a dickhead for the sake of being a dickhead... he had grievances that to be perfectly honest were correct.  That he disrespected AVB in a team meeting by airing them (after he privately told AVB and nothing changed, which should not be forgotten) was terrible form, but a good manager would realise it's the sign of a player champing at the bit to score goals, not just be a poisonous disruption.  And as a manager, you can work with that.

I'm a film director, and it's a lot like managing.  I can't physically hold the camera, light the set and act all at the same time, so my whole job is standing beside people and motivating them to all work together.  Of course there are major conflicts and issues with different personalities from time to time.  But it doesn't change the fact that you're all in this together, and somehow you've always gotta find a solution.  It's being a psychologist as much as anything else.  I always felt that's AVB's biggest blind spot... he was too successful in his first season with Porto where everything worked for him, and he never learned how to work with other human beings when the going got tough.

I'm working on a feature documentary at the moment with a major recording artist, and a few weeks ago she refused to shoot a sequence we had pre-planned, agreed on, and bought (non-refundable) plane tickets and accommodation for for the entire crew.  It was the perfect excuse to get pissed off, ""discipline"" her and potentially damage the end product.  And I wanted to do that.  But instead with counsel from my Exec Producer, I actually learnt a lot by realising that instead, I could listen to the source of her grievances, try to understand them, then offer a solution that worked for both of us.  We didn't go on the trip and we lost out on a whole lot of money, but we ended up getting something even better, and the whole atmosphere since has been great.

I'm not at all trying to say I'm better than AVB or that the situations are comparable (especially considering how little we know about what actually went on behind the scenes).  But when you're managing a team with a strike force consisting of a misfire, a guy about to leave for the MLS, and a recently promoted youth teamer, you need to realise that Adebayor is actually your biggest hope, and making him happy and getting him playing the way he likes to play is actually the best thing you can do for the team and the club.  Not protecting the sanctity of your ego and status.

Is that hard?  Sure.  Does it require a tricky, preternatural balance between empathy and discipline?  Of course.  But it is the job of every manager of every team ever.

AVB proved he could not do this at Chelsea, and he fell on the same sword here.

I have since found out that Universities (at least mine) are businesses where profit is the highest priority, which means the quality of education suffers.

I don't know who hires the people in my department, including the head, but it seems they are selected purely for their research, and often don't have the people skills to deal with student's issues to a satisfactory degree. 

I have a disability and issues with mental health, the views my head of department holds make it extremely difficult to manage my workload. The University makes some efforts to help students with mental health issues, but it lacks the necessary funding into this area, along with appropriate staff training. There's a prevailing idea amongst University staff that student's should be able to work independently and they (the staff) have no obligation to assist them, I would argue that if this were the case Universities should be cutting the number of staff as a cost saving measure as they are clearly otherwise useless. 

As far as social life at University goes, there are a lot of people at University for different reasons to me. A large proportion of them come across as dickheads.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but for staff in many research-oriented centres students *are* a painful inconvenience, as their job performance evaluation is entirely research-oriented. Education is not incentivised at all, and certainly not as a supplement for research outputs which contribute to the university's metrics.

Hydrogen is a fuel, and burning it is environmentally friendly per se. It's not 0 impact (you spend energy compressing it to liquid and storing it). However I suppose if making this method of disposal ""green"" is an objective then engineering your rocket to use hydrogen is totally reasonable. 

Solid boosters (if you choose to use them) are (to my understanding) less ""green"". ",0,1399311255,null,0,false,0,cha7532,t3_24orgt,t1_cha7532,t1_cha568g,null,1433661930,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Absolutely.

People also make a blanket assumption that just because Durham, for sake of example, is ranked X on the league table means that it's perfect for everyone and is excellent for Subject Area Y.

It's not that simple and nobody ever thinks to look deeper at the grading criteria, but teenagers get blinded by prestige and can't see the bigger picture.

Want a real laugh?  Visit The Student Room (thestudentroom.co.uk) and watch people lining up the paracetamol because they didn't get into Oxford and their lives are therefore ruined.  Again, not seeing the bigger picture - when you're 55 and going for that senior management role, nobody cares that you ""read"" Mesopotamian Warfare at Armand Van Helden College Cambridge 30+ years ago.

They're just supposed to relay information and knowledge whilst you take notes and then do your own reading on it.   

Most lecturers spend the majority of their time doing research and assisting Masters/PhD students. The former is why they get paid a lot. Going into a lecture theatre for 2 hours is kind of like their bit on the side.  

When they say ""Most of the learning is down to you and it is upto you to do further reading and learn it yourself"" it isn't a fob-off: it's true. It's why they have reading lists and tend to end their slides with ""Further Reading"".  

If you have any genuine concerns and need help, you can speak to them during their office hours, but the Uni should also have separate members of staff whose job is to sit down with students and help them, say, write 1st class essays when they're constantly getting upper 2:1 grades.  

Lecturers can only do so much with things like that, because as I said, they're not teachers and nor are they teacher-trained.  

All that is different from a lecturer who is genuinely lazy, never expands and clarifies, and expects students to blindly guess what they're supposed to do. They're two different things.

The crux of it is subtly calling UKIP out as being populist on the immigration/EU issue. Whilst not entirely untrue, it's a very crude evaluation of the popularity of UKIP and the situation in the UK. In reality, it's probably fairer to say that UKIP are a party of genuine euroskeptics who have included a number of other populist policies over the years - just about any quasi-conservative issue (hunting/school curriculums etc.) has worked its way into things they have said at one time or another, although since they have no official manifesto many of these are redundant things lower party members have said and may not be the case. However, in the public perception they are still primarily a single-issue party and in failing to recognize that, the article is basically writing off any potential UKIP success as purely populist.

One of the things that irks euro-skeptics so much is that rather than offer a genuinely level debate, this tends to happen where anyone anti-EU is immiediately reduced to the status of ""populist"", ""racist"" or ""little-Englander"". The reality is for a complex range of reasons - some of them legitimate, some of them less so, UKIP look set to do quite well in the upcoming European elections. That will have consequences both here and in the EU... since the EU is about to get crammed with MEPs intent on being a hindrance and the UK is about to embrace the fact the ""third"" party in the upcoming elections is potentially going to be UKIP and not the liberal democrats.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; that'd put Labour in an unfair lead

I think you're mistaken. The north are always the first to count their ballots (they see it as a matter of pride) so Labour always tend to start out with a seat lead when counting starts with the Tories picking up more towards the end. However that doesn't given them an ""unfair advantage"".

Lets say this Liverpool borough (of which there are many) counts first and its 60% Labour, 30% Tory and 10% ""Other"". What FPTP means is that the Tory and Other votes in that borough are completely pointless. The people might as well have not voted because ""losing"" votes don't count for anything.  

This is why if the UKIP vote was a broad 35% of the country it might mean zero seats because the majority of the people in those boroughs still vote for the main two parties. AV or Proportional would mean those ""losing"" votes could either be re-distributed in a tie-off or still count for something.

Then, foreign investors started coming in the mid 2000s, along with more and more oil money and, as Putin started cracking down, Russian money joined them.  The Chinese started coming later, perhaps 2006 and 2007 were the first big influxes as the Chinese property boom continued to grow.

I haven't read the report (I skimmed the conclusion section, but that was all), but that figure alone is meaningless, unless one assumes that FTAs are all equal.

FTAs are negotiations, each side wants the most favourable deal it can get. The number of FTAs isn't necessarily an indicator of whether those FTAs are as good as they could be. For example, it may be that some of those 13 which Switzerland obtained before the EU were delayed in the EU because the EU required extra pro-EU terms that the Swiss weren't able to force.

We're seeing that right now with TTIP v TTP. The EU has been able to get the US to allow public consultation on the more controversial areas of TTIP, whereas the TTP negotiations (to which the EU is not a part) are being kept as secret and closed as ever.

I moved out early because I was sick of it, the uni told my own father that I had and I quote ""PrincessGary had a lot of male friends, you should talk to her about how she acts"" I had a lot of male friends because I was on a male orientated course, who had the same interests as me.

From that my depression and social anxiety came back in full force , and I failed a year, saw a councilor and a promise that it would be accommodated, (I needed to be able to see people and talk to them one on one, nothing special, and help with group projects) nothing, my councilor sent email after email, and the tutors would refuse to listen to the emails.

If it is not in your contract, this is an issue you can take to employment tribunal and a trade union will facilitate that. If it is in your contract, you can still use unity with your coworkers to fight this through means such as strike action. Your union will advise you on the options available to you and the best course of action.

Any union is good and will support you. I recommend and am a member of the IWW. They will give you advice even if you're not a member and they are not politically tied. As I said though, any union is good.

Citizens Advice Bureau may well also be a useful port of call but there's not a great deal they can actually do themselves more than offering some legal advice.

As other people have said, it is worth taking note of events as they happen. Also, never give any kind of statement that indicates you accept the employer's decision is fair or valid as in some parts of employment law it can be used against you.

PS: don't be foolish. Employers don't like their workers being in a trade union (in general) as it stops them being able to do whatever the fuck they like.

true,Arkene,null,null,"To be honest it sounds like you have the right attitude to get the most out of your time at university. First year though counts for shit, so dont worry about the grades. The goal of the first year is mostly to make sure that everyone is on the same page in regards to the key aspects of the course. For computing this is ensuring that your maths skills are there, they are important as well as giving you the basics of programming. For business i imagine its teaching you the basics of the bullshit language they use.  Rule of thumb though is the 2nd year will be at least twice as hard as the first year, and 3rd year twice as hard as the 2nd. 

Id suggest making sure you find a group of people who have a similar attitude to yourself, befriending them and finding a house together. You will find your 2nd year a lot more enjoyable this way. Hopefully nobody waking you up at stupid times when you are trying to study. I also suggest taking your time there seriously. I found the work on my course stupidly easy, to the point i stopped trying as hard as i should. I came out of it with a 2:2, i still kick myself as i was 1% of a 2:1 and i should have argued about some of my assignments at the time as i was convinced i had done sufficient to warrant a higher grade on them. Especially my dissertation...had a maths lecturer grading an analysis on games design...but i was exhausted and ready to move on with my life. Very few people, especially in a top 20 university will be there as professional lecturers, they are there to do their own research and teaching undergrads is part of what they have to do to be there. accept that a lot of them may try and do the bare minimum they can get away with. you can try and fight it, and maybe make some progress. Or you can live with it and try and work around it. Try and do all conversations with them as email and keep each and every single one of them. basically get it in writing. If they say you dont need to do something, get it in writing and show them that if later they say they marked you down for not doing it. I got caught on a programming assignment on that after the lecturer said we would get no marks for including saving to and from a file, and then marked us down when we didn't include it. it annoyed us at the time (us being the three of us in that class with previous experience in pascal) but it was first year...and we were ignorant freshers. Which brings me onto my next suggestion, see if you can find an amenable 2nd or 3rd year who is willing to talk to froshers and knows how to work around the lecturers. Give you tips and pointers on how to answer the questions in a way which will let them mark you in the highest way possible. In some cases this is simply a matter of taking copious notes and then using their own expressions in the answers, in others it might mean backing up your arguments with detailed reasoning. Basically the difference between lecturers who are their way or no way and the more reasonable ones who will acknowledge a well put together argument. 
Oh and make sure you join some of the student unions social groups, make friends with people outside of your course.

My final suggestion, is to decide which direction you want to take your career in and then spend as much time as you can developing the skills and ensuring you have the evidence to support that you can do them. If you want to go into games development as an example, make sure you build a huge portfolio of games you have made, and design documentation you have produced. I'm sure you can come up with an equivalent for other career choices. You could get through the three years, be kinda lazy about it and come out with a fancy bit of paper. Or you could go through it, come out with that fancy bit of paper and a load of skills and knowledge  that you might have otherwise missed, some life experiences you might have never come across and different perspectives that are alien to where you grew up.

If you don't mind answering one question about radiation, something I've never understood... I've heard that radiation has a half life, my understanding being that every ""x"" amount of time (I think I remember at school X being fairly short, minutes/seconds), the amount of radiation, or the power of it halves. 

If that happens, how can something still be potent after 1000 years? With the rate in which things multiply in short time with doubling, I'd assume the rate in which they become nothing with halving is similar.

true,eudaimonist,uk,United Kingdom,"I'm not really arguing that there shouldn't be a referendum on membership of the EU - but I actually think the points you are making work against you. They don't sound like considered thoughts but things like 'democracy cannot be denied anymore' sound so ridiculous and hyperbolic that it just disengages people.

In many ways I think that's why so many are disenchanted from politics in general. Look, I can understand the point that the European Commission have too much power and that perhaps there aren't enough checks and balances - I get that. But at the same time, the transfer of power was signed off by democratically elected officials. By saying that democracy has been denied it sounds like you're ignoring the facts and trying to prey on people's fears.

I'll also say that democracy means much more than everyone having a vote - in fact the more representatives people have to vote for, the less they seem to care. MEPs, local council, MPs and now mayors and police commissioners. It's too much for the average voter to keep up with and care about and each vote they have means less for it.

I know this is all a very emotive issue (I'm not sure why, perhaps because it's being framed as 'us vs. them'?) and to be frank I'm pretty sure commenting tends to do more harm than good.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Salah was voted the best player in the league in his first season at Basel.

There is nothing wrong with that but that doesnt automatically make you one of the best young players in the world. I can't seem to find it right at this moment but I remember seeing a list a while ago of the last 20 players to win this award, let me give some insight, almost none have done anything to note since then (on a global scale). So winning this award doesnt make you a world beater at all.

&gt; Don't care what you say about the Swiss league being inferior

Why not? Its the truth. Besides Basel and Zurich (and maybe Young Boys and Grasshopper to a lesser extent) the quality of football is appealing. Not even close to the eredivisie or ligue 1.
&gt; winning the title in your first European season

Basel have dominated the Swiss league in recent years. They have won the last **4** league titles in Switzerland. They are one of the biggest clubs in the country, they did it without Salah, and they did it with him, doesnt make amazing.

Also, in that year in 30 appearances he contributed 5 goals and only a few more in assists to FC Basel's campaign, not really being their most vital player.

Fans of Basel told me even though he was a good player for them the reason he won the award **is** because of his age. They say that had he been 28 or 29 that he definitely would not have won it. So using the reasoning that he is 21 *and* won the award is a bit redundant for a lack of a better word.


**Edit** Also, if you don't think the Swiss league is so inferior what are your thoughts on Shkëlzen Gashi. A midfielder for Grasshopper who is currently on 17 goals in 21 appearances for the club and is absolutely smashing it in the league. Comparing that to Salah's 5 goals in 29 appearances of course.

I mean with your experience in halls...I just have to say, shit happens. At least you'll move out next year and get to control your own food and hopefully, who you live with. I personally enjoyed my time in halls and whilst there were lots of incidents that were annoying, the social life and the general camaraderie was enough to make up for it. That said, I'd never choose to do it again though!

My advice to you regarding teaching is to see whether you have any recourse for addressing the issues. Do you have a student union? Do you have student representation for your course? Is there someone higher up in your department to complain to when lecturers are bad? Do you give adequate feedback regarding these bad lectures/teaching? I don't know how effective these measures are in your university, but my experience has been reasonable.

For example, I'm the student rep on my course, and this year, I took my year's complaints that the lectures contained too many students and not enough small-group discussions because the 3rd year modules are mixed with grad students. They took our feedback very seriously and worked with us to find a solution that didn't involve cutting down on time with lecturers. I spoke to the dean of the humanities to plead the case for more funding to pay for more hours for the lecturers as well as to pay for teaching assistants. By second term, funding had been granted and the problem was fixed and we had extra hours and extra seminars. Lecturers became more aware of the difference between undergrad and grad students in their lectures and have been trying different strategies to make sure grad students don't dominate the conversation.

I found that I had drastically overestimated how smart I was before I went to university, and met some of the smartest people I have met on my course which pushed me to the limits of my ability. Though I had &lt;10 contact hrs p/week, a lot of the lecturers would give me additional help in their own time and I would go to additional/guest lectures in my own and other subjects. I had to spend a lot of my own time revising and working to really get the most out of my degree

Meeting other people doing other subjects gave me new insights in how to approach things to, and joining a sports team was in hindsight probably one of the best things I did, as was writing and editing one of the student newspapers.

As for the halls and 'unay' culture, that's an unfortunate fact of first year, but I found a group of people with which I could associate without issue. The uni was quite good at repairing things too. 

These were all things crucial for securing a graduate scheme.

Possibly true, but also irrelevant. The topic started by the OP isn't merely about the most expensive homes in London, but about all homes in London. As can be seen in graphs such as [this one](http://www.shashankkhare.com/2012/10/money-illusion-in-london-housing-market.html), property prices in London dipped in the late 2000s. Since the graph looks at averages then if, as you say, expensive property stayed level, then this means that prices for cheap property for first time buyers must have fallen even more substantially than the graph displays.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"I don't think Blackadder Goes Forth was meant to be as humorous as its' predecessors.

Aside from being the final real Blackadder series, the setting is deliberately grim. While the final few moments may have been entirely accidental, the final spoken line in the series of ""Good luck everyone"" seems to indicate that even a selfish bastard like Blackadder...really does care, in his own way.

Blackadder is more than just a comedy. The man we see in the fourth installment is an Officer. A Captain. A man in whom great confidence has been placed from above and below alike in the chain. A man of experience and ability he would never have acquired had he not, in some small way, cared for the men he fought with.

The series mentions him being in one-sided battles, but never references when these took place in his career. 

I think the show tries to tell us that despite being a man of experience in war, of sound command ability, of logic and reason and wit, despite being a man of numerous skills (spying, hunting out spies, piloting, shooting) despite being a man of perspective (""With fifty thousand men dying every week who's going to miss a pidgeon?"") and despite seeming to be a genuine man of honour, not shirking either from his execution or for straight-up yelling at Cpt. Darling when he felt his honour slighted.

Despite all that, he's just a man as far as his superiors are concerned. Just like George, just like Baldrick, just like the other men of Blackadder's Company that we never see or hear outside of that cheer in the last episode. Just like Captain Darling, as the end reveals, just like everyone else. Even those that had the pleasure of knowing men in high command like George are still, simply, just men.

and men, far more than were needed, died for the sake of a few sodden feet of ground, because of a blue-blooded family feud and one wanker with a revolver.

Maybe I'm reading too much into subtle nuances that aren't there. Maybe I'm asking too much of a series made by what were effectively a bunch of inexperienced young men and women just out of university who were having a laugh. 

However, over the course of the last year I've seen this show labelled as propaganda, its' good name trawled through the dirt and its' attempt at gallows humour seen as nothing more than leftie tripe by men who, had they lived a hundred years ago, would never have seen a trench or had to go over the top, and who most likely would be ordering the people they're talking down to to die for those few bloodsoaked feet of rocks and soil.

Maybe the show could have been funnier, maybe it couldn't, it was dreamt up, written and performed by amateurs in borrowed costumes. Yet it does a better job of balancing the horror of war, in the most horrific of wars, with the simple human desire to have a bit of a chuckle.

Standard [dash cams from Halfords ] (http://news.cision.com/halfords/r/halfords-develops--dash-cam--range-in-response-to-motorists-concerns-over-crash-for-cash-claims,c9479224) do take SD cards as you describe. The cameras cost about £100 and an SD card to record a shift costs no more than a tenner. I dare say with bulk buying  these costs could include fitting. Forgive me for doubting your point that the logistics for uploading an SD card to a remote server are 'huge'. Technophobes throughout the country are regularly managing to update their Flickr and Picasa accounts. In the event of a 10-15 year old PC lacking a card reader a USB / SD adapter costs less than a fiver.

In any event, surely,  the footage from the dash cameras would only ever be required in the case of a serious or contended 'polcol' so that the officers concerned could be immediately exonerated from any blame. I can't understand why officers are not insisting that these friendly witnesses are not being installed immediately. Is there any restriction on officers fitting their own devices?

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"If comparing Pro-EU reporters to EU-sceptic reporters, then:

From the report by Civitas **(eu-sceptic)**:

&gt;*Chief among them would be the right to negotiate trade agreements independently, since the only evidence we have suggests that the costs to UK exporters of surrendering that right, in lost opportunities of freer trade, have been terrifyingly large, perhaps more than all the other costs put together. It is just as well for those who favour EU membership that successive UK governments have agreed that these costs should never be measured, estimated or even mentioned. If they are anything near those suggested by the Swiss comparison, it is difficult to believe that the UK would still be a member of the EU.*

Compared to the CBI **(pro-eu)** statement reported in the BBC article:

&gt;*The CBI's recent Our Global Future report said full membership of the EU was ""a better vehicle for harnessing the global trends reshaping the world economy than all the alternative options put forward"".
""The European Union also supports UK business in realising its global ambitions by providing significant influence over the rules, policies and priorities that allow British-based firms to seize opportunities across the globe,"" it stated. It anchors UK trade around the world through the signing of high-quality, ambitious Free Trade Agreements and the creation of globally recognised standards that open markets.*

Who is correct? Well formerly back in 1999, CBI: [Business backs euro, says CBI](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/500231.stm):-

&gt;*Ten months after the launch of the euro, British businesses are, in principle, in favour of joining the single European currency, according to the director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Adair Turner.*

I cannot take seriously anyone or any organization that supported joining the EURO. I'd vote for Civitas being more reliable *if only* based off this track-record of the CBI.

I think this is putting the economic self-interests first ahead of the democratic/sovereign interests of the people:

[Chapter 24 — Liberal Leader Mackenzie King Said in 1935](http://www.michaeljournal.org/plenty24.htm):-

&gt;*“Once a nation parts with the control of its currency and credit, it matters not who makes that nation's laws. Usury, once in control, will wreck any nation. Until the control of the issue of currency and credit is restored to government and recognized as its most conspicuous and sacred responsibility, all talk of the sovereignty of Parliament and of democracy is idle and futile.”*

&gt;*“The Liberal Party believes that credit is a public matter, not of interest to bankers only, but of direct concern to every citizen. The Liberal Party declares itself in favour of the immediate establishment of a duly constituted national bank for the control of the issue of money in terms of public needs. The flow of money must be in relation with the domestic, social, and industrial needs of the Canadian people.”*",1,1399317207,null,0,false,0,chaa38z,t3_24sb5g,t1_chaa38z,t1_cha6si9,null,1433663320,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,Xani,uk,Dorset,"As I'm sure everyone has said - Welcome to your first year at university. Don't freak about your coursework - it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of your degree because most pieces are only marked as contributing in the second year. This is the year where you learn the fundementals, get drunk, party all night and enjoy the freedom of independence. 

If your lecturers are terrible, make a formal complaint. You're paying for this course so you have a right to voice your concerns. Surprisingly, your SU is there for more than just holding millions of events to raise funds for grad projects. They'll help you fight to make your point so that you get educated to the standard you deserve. Essentially **complain to someone about it**.

From the sounds of it, you're in halls? Halls are, for the most part, shitty and overpriced. Everyone is noisy and nobody cares about setting off the fire alarm at 2am. All I can say is soldier on! Next year you can move to a *real house!* with some actual friends and not a bunch of people you met on the day you moved in. 

My first year frustrated the ever loving shit out of me. I lived with people I hated, I didn't go out because I was worried about spending money (my loan was considerably more then than it is now) and I didn't  enjoy myself at all. I hated the fact that I was no longer the best in the class (huuuuuge learning curve right there), that I was producing work for a mark that didn't matter and I was as lonely as I've ever been. 

All I can say is: First year is wank. Try to make some friends and enjoy the marginal freedom while it lasts. Move to a better house at the end of term, away from the crappy area you're in now. Also - if you have the time, get a job. Third year is where the government decides you can live off of pure thin air, so backup money for paying off tenancy's and moving bills is always helpful.",0,1399317780,null,0,false,0,chaado2,t3_24s9g9,t1_chaado2,t3_24s9g9,null,1433663456,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I'm a post-grad doing a PhD and I have friends who do utter waffle like music history, which unless you want to become a music historian, is a waste of time. 

Before you music historians write an angry response, here is my reasoning; 
I approached their subject with an open mind, and I even tried reading some literature and familiarizing myself with the way the course is done.

It's non-stop bollox. Basically, you are forced to read and sit through unbelievably poorly done lectures and seminars, get a mountain shit photocopies of ""letters"" and are expect to write unfathomably long essays. In these seminars, you sit around and discuss the various music progressions through history and their relevance to today's classical approach. It was interesting, but it gets very deep - I have no reason to complain, after all this is something out of my depth. But the way it's discussed is very snobby and elitist, you must agree with the lecturer, because you are a nobody and their word is golden. No critical thinking, just learning facts from rote and abiding the authors opinion.

The way you write a scientific or engineering paper, is basically done by researching a lot of current papers found on reputable journal publishers and tying them in with your own. Everything is open to criticism and scrutiny. 

With a course like musical history, your only resources are these ""letters"" which basically are a 20 - 50 page long fart-smelling, ego drenched, chest-bashing load of tripe, written by a lecturer to another lecturer disagreeing with some tiny little detail they mentioned in their previous correspondence. These letters can be nearly 100 years old, can only be found in physical copies and the golden bit is that some of these letters are written by your own professors and tutors. 

If you write a paper that disagrees with them, you get marked hard. If you write one disagreeing with one of their opponents, you are marked high. 
A paper can be 12,000 words.

A short list of some of the more extreme shit that happened because of the three of them:

* Microwave destroyed as a 'joke'. We had to pay £40 each to replace it as the culprit wouldn't own up to the uni, even though we all knew who it was.

* *I* had to pay £80 for a broken window because one of them threw a stone at my window while drunk.

* Recycling bin from the kitchen filled with a mix of water, piss and beer and propped it on my dorm door in halls. When I opened it, it flooded my room, wrecking stuff- including almost half my lecture notes- and I had to move for a week until the room had dried out and the carpet was replaced. What prompted this? I asked them to keep it down a bit cause it was 3am during exams.


* Our living room/kitchen TV was broken by one of them throwing the Xbox at it -the actual machine, not a controller. Thankfully, since it happened while I was at a lecture, I avoided having to pay for it. Downside? It was my fucking xbox and he broke it, then refused to pay for a new one.

* The entire corridor in our halls had to pay £90 for new fire extinguishers and an extra £200 for violating the safety code. Why? Two of them had a drunken foam fight using them. It took the uni a month to replace them, so god help us if there had been an actual fire since we were on the 3rd floor.

* On the topic of fire safety: Piling up chairs, tables and the sofa in front of my door while I was inside asleep. An hour later the fire alarm went off because someone burned toast. When I opened the door, I narrowly avoided it all falling on me and pinning me. If it had been a real fire, I could have been trapped. When confronting them they said, and I quote ""Chill, admit would be totally hilarious if you were unconcious and we left you there. Anyway, thats what firefighters are for, to get you out the building when you can't."" No it wouldnt be 'hilarious'. Firefighters are for fighting the fire, its in the name. Also, not one of you would have the scraps of decency to carry an unconcious person out of a burning building. Fucking pathetic. */rantfinish*

The halls buildings are within a few minutes walk of campus, and are especially close if you get a place within the student village (literally across the road). Everything is within walking distance, and you can take the passenger ferry across to Mount Batten or Cornwall to get right in to the countryside, if that's your sort of thing.

There's absolutely tonnes of opportunity to meet new people between halls, your course, and randomers you happen to meet on nights out - not to mention the wealth of societies and clubs. Just put yourself out there, hang out in the flat kitchen etc rather than your room.

Night life in Plymouth is good (coming from a town half the size of Plymouth). There are three or four large chain clubs (Oceana, Varsity, Revolution, Walkabout etc), the Student Union, tonnes of smaller clubs/bars on North Hill (right next to the student village and campus) and plenty of  (slightly more up-market) venues on the Barbican. 

I've never felt Plymouth to be a particularly rough area (at least not the area directly around the city centre where you'll spend most of your first year if you're in halls), so don't be too concerned about that!

As for the uni itself, I've found my course to be well resourced and supported. The lecturers are good (you may get the odd lecturer you don't quite mesh with, but I think that's true of anywhere) and the library being open 24/7 is sure to save your ass when you realise you have a deadline in for tomorrow, haha.

For your monthly savings, first contribute to your pension as [It is just a tax-free pot of cash you, your employer (and sometimes the Government) pays into, as a way of saving up for your retirement.](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/discount-pensions). You should pay in at least as much as your employer's scheme will match (free pay rise) and you should consider aiming towards putting 11% of your gross income into it (but check fees etc. and this 11% rule of thumb could take into account your S&amp;S)

The remaining savings I would recommend using high interest current accounts [see also other short-term advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/24sc15/21_year_old_w_30k_in_isas_slow_growth/) as you will currently only use £6k of your new £15k limit.

true,yhkim1219,null,null,"Hello! I hope this won't be buried, but here is some advice from a final year student few months away from graduation:

First year: Most important year socially and it will determine how your uni life will be for the most parts. Please please find and make some sane friends, who are not mentally challenged that goes binge drinking, drugs, steals, because it's first year yolo, apathetic cunts. 

The reason why you need sane friends, who knows self control and can take care of themselves is because of the reasons you put up at the top. I know many people believe Uni life will be the best time in their lives so make the most of it and yes it will be, 100%.

However, this doesn't mean fucking and drinking everything in sight, going out every night, spending shit loads of money on useless shit, doing any or everything ""for a laugh"".

Try to stay clear of these fucktards and during second year, which is coming soon, move in with the sane people. You must remember the top priority of you and anyone else going to university isn't to have a fucking laugh, but it is to gain an education, make yourself and society better off. The having a laugh bit is a bonus.

In second year, when things start to matter, you will notice a dramatic change between the students. Large parts of students who acted like lunatics, will start to be a little serious, so it will get better.

Third year, those who haven't changed, well thank god you stayed away from them, if they don't change by now they're fucked for life. Everyone else will be too busy studying to be going out.

About lecturers: there will be fuck ups. Oh so many fuck ups. holy mother of fuck ups. But you have to do your best to keep complaining &lt;- oh so very important. Find your head of department, be friendly with him and also be friendly to your personal advisor. They will be the ones writing your references.

Many lecturers are there to do research and extra study, the being a lecturer part is just a side thing, so don't feel too annoyed if they're shit at teaching. You'll get used to it and it's why so many students do not go to lectures, unless the lecturer is good.

SO basically: Find some sane loyal friends to live with, ignore the lunatics, university is for your personal benefit, fuck the rest (at the extreme), if there are shitty lecturers, complain, write emails and also be friendly with your head of department, advisor. 

BTW some side things: If you really want to be selfish (I actually kind of recommend this), be as selfish as you can! most of the grades are standardised, which means if more people do well, then the marking will be harsh, if the marks are overall bad, then they will be more lenient. This means if you help too many people then your grades will be affected. Petty I know, but you wouldn't believe how much this fucking matters. Only help your close friends if you will, but don't help too many, it's not your responsibility to teach him, they're not in high school any more.

Finally, despite all that, don't be a total dick. social life is important. Especially in the UK. If you want to get a job, networking is the best possible thing and in the working world, you're not going to be working on your own but with others so build up them social skills.

Also a user called Imarsha_96 (who if I'm right is the admin of another villa message board...) has made up these mock-ups based on what Delphino123 said:

My first year at medical school was very similar.  I had to study in the library as my halls were often very noisy.  Luckily I got a room in a nice ""flat-style"" halls complex which meant that there were only five of us in the place, and my flatmates were rather bookish individuals who didn't have parties.  Some of my friends lived in halls where 20 people shared a kitchen and it was hellish.

Fast-forward to professional life and I learn nearly everything I need for my postgraduate exams myself.  Learning how to study and take in material will stand you in very good stead for the future so it's good to hear that you are in the habit already.

Advice?  Get earplugs, stay on campus to study, have discipline with your study regularity.  Once you move out of halls, try to move away from studenty areas and find nice, quiet people to share with.

It will get better once you're not constantly exposed to LAD behaviour and drunkenness.

Firing people based on belief is legal and happens in state schools. It is wrong here and is wrong in the case of the article. 

All schools have to teach faith and talk about it in whole school assemblies. Most schools have at least a nominal religious domination. Regardless assemblies etc. have to be of a broadly Christian nature. 

My comment stands: this would not be as big news if it was not about muslisms. It dosnt make it any better or worse. I disagree with the same regardless but it would not be as big news. 

I never mentioned anything about extremists. Islam as a religion that forces it views on people looks like an issue now. All fundamentalists religions that force their views on others are a problem. Islam gets the most press.

Lucas is so good at what he does, that's tackling and intercepting, so he seems a bit awkward having to contribute to the passing game. 

Luis is clearly off the boil, he is seeing moves he wants to make, but his body is just not doing it, so perhaps an illness like suspected, still dangerous, but does look off the boil.

We miss a CAM in the hole, Cou is our bridge between Midfield and Attack, instead it has been a mixture of long balls and a little passing play, lots of good runs have been made though. 

We are lucky Palace have no real attack here, because we are not at our best, there have been a lot of misplaced passes and deflections and in general seem to have lost a little spark, if not for Allens positioning and good header on the corner, we would be 0-0 here,

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm so glad I came across your post, OP! It needs bloody saying by more students more often. I hate the stereotypical view of students but I can't say it's incorrect from my experiences so far.

I am also a fresher at a good university and am coming to the end of my first year of a three (possibly four if I do a placement/extra undergrad masters year) year degree.

I had reservations about coming to uni from the start. I don't come from a family where university is just something that you ""just do"". It's an expensive undertaking for myself and my parents so I thought about it carefully - but I was surrounded by a lot of people at sixth form (by no means all of them are like this, but come on every student in year 13 knows who I'm talking about) that were just not university material. They didn't know/care about what subject they wanted to study until it was about a month before the deadline for UCAS applications. 

I can see a lot of those people at my university now. They're here for the lifestyle, an extra 3 years of dossing about at someone else's expense. It's exams soon but the student club nights round here are still packed until the early hours by people who've barely been to lectures all year, then who moan about incomplete notes/hard questions in the exam (it'll be like January exams all over again).

I also had the experience of being taught extremely basic maths/computer/life stuff in the first semester. The tutors knew it was easy but told us it would benefit our end of year grade average so it was a win-win situation (not such a win for the value of a degree in society I might add...).

The drinking situation is horrendous. I live in student accommodation and have seen a lot of damage done from this relentless party animal attitude- a rat was actually microwaved in a flat's kitchen down the corridor from me by a bunch of fucknuts who thought it was funny. We have cleaners here that come around the flats twice a week and a lot of people take that as a cue to act and live like pigs, it's vile. 

And the teaching... yes some lecturers really don't care. Not enough feedback, published office hours that no tutors actually stick to and unanswered emails have really bugged me this year. I can only assume it might get better as I get higher up as this is a research intensive Russell group uni, so obviously teaching younger students isn't their main priority (which blows, I hate thinking of my slowly growing student debt even though it's a necessary evil that probably won't hurt me).

We have a lot of international teachers here too, it's not so big an issue in my department but sometimes the quality of English is very poor. This actually goes for a lot of international students here too - group work is made extremely difficult when you have people in the group that have little grasp of spoken or written English. I just don't understand how they cope during the term! The university clearly loves the fees they pay though.

The thing is I study Chemistry - I can't learn this anywhere else but I just wish I could. It's not so simple as taking an apprenticeship or working your way up, I need this degree to get anywhere. But the expense and atmosphere of university really riles me. I've had some great times this year and made a few good friends but yeah, at times I look around at the twisted man- and women- children around me and can't believe how hard I worked to get here and that this is the place my parents told me I would only end up in if I worked really, really hard and was deserving of a place :|",0,1399319876,null,0,false,0,chabfrk,t3_24s9g9,t1_chabfrk,t3_24s9g9,null,1433663954,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

With regards to the ""more assists, more goals"" point that you want me to address, what I would say is that this isn't Moneyball and it isn't that black and white (Koscielny, for example, is a better defender than Terry and Cahill if you look at all the opta stats and we both know that isn't true). Watching the players for 90 minutes every single week gives more of an indication of their talents and its safe to say that neither of us have done that. The people who have done that, however, came to the conclusion that Salah was the best player out of everyone in the Swiss league and Piazon wasn't even good enough to be featured in every game (29 appearances in 39 games apparently). If he got injured then fair enough but I can't remember that happening. 

At the end of the day we have no idea who's the better player just yet and they're all so young we have no idea who's going to be the best in a few years time either. What I can say with certainty is that the statement ""Piazon and Hazard are better than Salah"" is unfounded and has no substantial evidence to support it and ""Piazon and Thorgan have both had a much larger impact on their clubs"" is so ridiculous its beyond belief.

I have no qualms with admitting we don't really know how good any of them can be at Chelsea. You're the one making all these claims with complete certainty as if they are facts when they simply aren't.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Spain and Belgium have their own secessionist movements that they don't want to encourage (Spain doubly so), setting a precedent for smooth and painless re-entry for Scotland would do just that.

I think the situation with Spain is greatly exaggerated. Their position seems [pretty clear](https://sites.google.com/site/gironaindependencia/2014-0203-1):

&gt;José-Manuel García-Margallo, foreign minister, told the Financial Times: “If Scotland becomes independent in accordance with the legal and institutional procedures, it will ask for admission [to the EU]. If that process has indeed been legal, that request can be considered. If not, then not,” he said.
&gt;
&gt;While he refused to comment directly on whether Spain might veto Scottish accession to the EU after an independence vote, he insisted the cases of Scotland and Catalonia were “fundamentally different”. Madrid would continue to resist a Catalan plan to hold its own referendum on independence less than two months after the Scottish vote in September, he said.
&gt;
Asked about the independence campaign, Spain’s foreign minister said: “We don’t interfere in other countries’ internal affairs. If Britain’s constitutional order allows – and it seems that it does allow – Scotland to choose independence, we have nothing to say about this.”

Spain's objection over Catalonia is that their constitution prohibits unilateral secession from Spain, not that they have some fundamental objection to any two countries going their separate ways.

&gt; The UK may become belligerent in the event of a Yes vote if Salmond &amp; Co. continue on this undiplomatic path of demands and threats.

I guess any country [might become belligerent](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/english-would-bomb-our-airports.17005697) in the event of a Yes vote. They might become belligerent in the event of a No vote too, but there's not really any evidence to suggest either outcome.

&gt; Let's not forget that so far the SNP have threatened to default on Scotland's share of UK national debt if London doesn't submit to a full currency union, and he was in Bruges this weak threatening his future allies and partners that if they don't let Scotland in immediately they'd deny them access to Scotland's fishing stock and block access to Norway's.

I think your ""doesn't submit"" rather gives your own views away. Personally I think it's overwhelmingly likely that there will be a currency union, and I don't expect Scotland to refuse to take on Scotland's share of the UK's national debt (quite different from defaulting on a debt, but I would expect Scotland to receive some share of both the assets and the debts it's helped build up/live off as part of the UK).

I suspect the negotiations will be a little more grown-up than some debates online - there seems to be a lot of ""oh yeah, well my dad can beat up your dad"" to these arguments.

I think you're again projecting your own beliefs when you say that Salmond was ""threatening his future allies"". The context was what would the outcome be if Scotland was outside the EU. It's not outrageous or threatening to point out that while doing so would mean Scotland would lose access to some of the benefits of the EU, EU members would lose access to some of the benefits that Scotland brings.

It's hardly credible to think that Scotland could be outside the EU yet EU members could continue to treat it as if it was still bound by EU treaties. Indeed if Scotland votes no, and UKIP obtain their goal of leaving the EU, the exact same situation will occur. It hardly seems like a threat to say that the UK's fishing rights would become a matter for the UK if the UK were to leave the EU.

&gt; Hell I even saw Croatia on Sunday Politics Scotland this weekend flexing its voting/veto muscles on the Scottish independence issue.

I believe all the Croatian ambassador said was that *if* Scotland were to seek opt-outs then that *might* prolong the process? That seems quite plausible: the more complex Scotland's accession process is, the longer it might take.

Croatia is an interesting example though. Their accession process took 10 years. That took so long because they had to harmonise their national legislature with EU law, make real progress on absolutely flagrant corruption, hand over some war criminals to the Hague, and they still had an ongoing border dispute with an existing EU member.

It seems unlikely that Scotland's process is going to be anywhere near as difficult than that.",0,1399320196,null,0,false,0,chablno,t3_24qbd0,t1_chablno,t1_chaand1,null,1433664037,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,ViridianPanther,cyberman,Cyberperson,"I hate to be *that guy*, but it wasn't made on synthesisers—the first Moog synthesisers that we would recognise as synthesisers were only beginning to take shape at around the time *Who* first went on the air. It was made by Delia Derbyshire and Dick Mills with a combination of recorded sounds and test equipment.

The bass line, the 'diddly-dum' noise, was a string instrument—probably a piano—being *twanged* and then copied off, played back at different speeds to alter the pitch, and literally stuck together with tape down the length of a corridor. Each *dum* would be a little bit of tape.

The main melody was created with banks of oscillators, which were designed for creating test tones and *not* for creating music! The 'wee-wah-woo' answering phrase and the bridge (the tinkly bit) were created by attaching a keyboard to these oscillators.

The main melody (the 'oo-ee-ooo' noise) had to be done manually to get the glide between the notes, probably by turning twisting a knob on the oscillator very, very carefully. Something a lot of people don’t realise is that the baseline has another layer underneath it, a layer of “lurch” notes—these were also done on the oscillators, and help give the bass a thicker texture.

As for the wind bubbles and the other spooky sounds, that was achieved by filtering white noise and then cutting it up and mixing it together.

The whole thing then had to be mixed by hand. Not only were there no computers and therefore no digital audio workstations, there weren’t even any multitrack tape machines—it literally came down to plugging all the components into the same recorder and hitting ‘play’ at the right time!",0,1399320488,null,0,false,0,chabqw7,t3_24skl4,t1_chabqw7,t1_cha8stl,null,1433664101,54,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,54

They tend to put far more effort into the teaching side resulting in their research suffering. Now for the majority of lecturers, research is what they do the job for so its no surprise they see lecturering more as a nuisance and a formality they have to deal with themselves. You've just got to get used to that reality and hope you come across the few lecturers who are genuinly great teachers. 

You of course find the lecturers who are good lecturers and do have good research, but they're not amazingly common.

As for lecturers with poor English. Its sucks and they're around in a lot of courses. I've had Spanish, German and Italian lecturers who were impossible to follow because you spend most of the lecture working out what they even said, before you have the time to process what it means. With them I just did my best to get the notes down and did extra work at home with friends and it all eventually clicked. One Italian lecturer appeared to have translated his work into several languages before English, and I realised a week before the exam the statistical mechanics was just mathematical descriptions of basic thermodynamics. It immediately clicked and I ended up doing alright on the exam. He was however an extremely poor lecturer who gave less than zero fucks about students. We all complained but nothing got done about them as his research was very good.

If you have an ebook reader  of some description there are any number of places text books are available... all be it illegally. 

FWIW uni is, essentially, self-taught,  with some guidance around what you should be teaching yourself this week. Use what resources you have around  uni, and if your lecture in a topic made no sense, remember MIT, NYU, Harvard (some) and others have all their lectures online. I gave up paying a fortune for crappy lectures through colleges and Kaplan for my accountancy qualification, I got the books and went online for explanations where I struggled. The only thing I missed was being able to discuss it with other students (I learn best through conversation rather than reading). 

Accomodation will get better next year - if the people in your halls are really seriously problematic you can talk to your housing officer (if the uni doesn't have one, the SU will) and get moved, but don't expect things to be wildly  different.

He's really a left wing that can play LB.  Everyone always likes to remember how ""great"" BAE was, but AVB shipped him off because he is a pretty classic LB, and with the ""shrink the field"" high line mentality under AVB, defensive players that can add more to the attack are better than true defenders.

Look at Rose's mistakes.  On several occasions, as the last defender, he gives up possession under pressure.  There has to be someone behind him.  Like a CB.  He also makes some silly tackles, but largely these are because he is having to track so far back from an attacking position.

Rose would be a great wing for later in the game to stretch the opposition and help in defense, but as a deep defender or as the last defender, he's terrible.  ",0,1399321259,null,0,false,0,chac597,t3_24ssbn,t1_chac597,t3_24ssbn,null,1433664289,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

That their paper is aimed at nullifying pro-EU positions doesn't make it any less anti-EU. As noted, the most recent papers from this Think Tank on Europe are:

&gt; Why British democracy and the EU don't mix

&gt; The surrender of our democracy to the EU

&gt; Time to Say No [to the EU]

To me that is a strong indication that the think tank may not be neutral, and may be pushing anti-EU papers. Ideally all claims would be scrutinised, but in an adversarial debate-style political system, this rarely happens - one side simply tries to shout louder than the other side, and forces every issue to a binary situation.

On your three points, though, I would like to point out that the democratic deficit with the EU (to the extent that it exists) is vanishing over time; the EU is now - on most metrics - as if not more democratic and accountable than the UK government. The lack of public engagement being one of the big areas of concern (along with the influence of the national executives); but that isn't something the EU government can fix on its own. I'm not sure there is any real criminal/legal confusion with the EU, and threats to sovereignty are a problem for the Sovereign (or Parliament - meaning the leadership of the two political parties) not us mere citizens.

The worst thing that has happened on the last day of term some idiots from the corridor below us threw yoghurt over our kitchen. This wasn't really that much of a problem because the cleaners sorted it out.

I'm also catered, but seven days a week and the food is pretty good. I'm a bit of a 'food snob' but even I think it's okay food. I've met some of the best people I've ever met in my life and really feel like I'm part of a thriving community. People here are academic, really nice and seem to genuinely care about the reputation of the university, their college and themselves in the eyes of the public.

Yes we get charged up the arse, but my course has for the most part been great. Of course there has been bad lecturers, but you will always get people that are bad at their 'job' (and remember lecturing isn't really their job - it's only part of it). I think a good way to think about university is that a university is a center for learning rather than a center for teaching.

I think a main reason that my experience has been so good is the collegic system (where your 'halls' have basically what is a mini student's union in them and it matters even when you leave to live out). There's a lot of college spirit and great support within the college if you're struggling with anything, be it personal problems, financial or work.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"In my experience most of them have a job involving research and writing. They write books and journal articles and advise in industry/commerce and make money that may. Lecturing is something they do the rest of the time for probably about the same amount of money or less as your 6th form teachers. I wouldn't say they don't care but they aren't there to ensure you do well or to ensure you are prepared. They're there to lead you through the topics and give you the information you need to pass. As long as you have heard them say (or directed you to something that says) every detail in the syllabus they've done what they are paid to do. I had at least 2 lecturers who were really terrible. One because she was boring, inaudible and new to the job, the other because he was an arrogant prick. I've also had some really great teachers who were passionate experts in the topics. It's kind of the luck of the draw but if you have options in your later years it helps because you can pick lecturers and topic you like. Then again I only paid 3500 a year so you've got more of a reason to expect more even if universities haven't changed. 

However trust me, the work will ramp up in 2nd and 3rd year. Many other people on your course may not be as familiar with the maths as you are. I don't know if maths was a requirement to get on the course but they have to get people to the same playing field before they can get into it. Just as an example I'm doing law and for one topic out of four in my first year I wrote down 30-40 cases I needed to memorise to use in the exam. In my final year exam for another topic I'm attempting to memorise 280 cases in more detail than any before. Partly that's because I'm more interested, partly because I've become better at doing my course and partly because the work has got harder and bigger in scale. I didn't like first year either partly on account of drunk idiots but living with only people you like is really fun. If you've got a good work ethic in the first year then you'll do well and it sounds like you do.

true,Jharakn,cnty-scotland,Edinburgh,"As has been said by a lot of people here already, 1st year at university isn't about your academic development but your social one. Most freshers have never operated independently of their parents before and before you can grow as a person you've got to push your boundaries. Sure a lot of the time it'll go too far but the only way you can learn is to be given the opportunity to be a total fuckwit, gleefully become a total fuckwit and then once the hangover has faded, the broken bones mended and the police had dropped charges realize what a total fuckwit you were and resolve to not do that again.

In the same bracket you've got to learn tolerance of others, like what the OP is doing. Back home you were the biggest fish in the pond, the hopes and dreams of your parents are heaped on you and you're spoiled. You crafted and lived in a nice happy bubble where everything was just so. That bubble has just been truly popped and you've got to toughen up OP, because there's a lot of fuckwits in the world and you'll have to deal with them throughout your adult life.

And yes 90% of what you'll learn in your first year is bullshit because the staff know that before their class can settle down to learn the good stuff they need time to burn off their fuckwittery and toughen up. 

Don't worry OP you'll learn the good stuff later, you'll also make some of the best friends you'll know, have the best times and the worst and leave in debt but a more independent person, not just with academic skills but with an ability to thrive on your own which will serve you as importantly as any degree for your first job.

true,w0ss4g3,cnty-wales,Not Welsh but I live here,"I don't entirely agree. I have a PhD in maths and I won't be taking them up on this in a hurry. However, I know a lot of other people who absolutely loved the teaching aspects which a PhD can offer.

I took tutorials for first years, marking for all years, as well as maths drop-in sessions which were run within my department (open to the whole university). I also had the opportunity to give a short lecture course to postgraduates. All of these things were paid in additional to my basic funding. I did them primarily for the extra money, but also to gain teaching experience for a potential academic career.

Now the point is that others who did them found that they absolutely loved teaching, more so than the research. A couple of them have ended up going into teaching in schools (usually via a fast-tracked teacher training course).. others have taken up educational-only roles (i.e. no research) in universities. Plenty of others have taken the money and gone into various aspects of finance and so on.

I would say that someone who has undertaken a Maths PhD (I can't speak for Physics) has a far better understanding of what it's like to teach than someone who has simply finished a BSc and would have to go through teacher training. The other point is that someone with a PhD (at least in maths) has many options open to them and if they choose to go into teaching it will be because they want to, not because they can't get a job elsewhere. The offer to pay them more is positive in that it removes the thoughts about earning a poor salary as a barrier.",0,1399322301,null,0,false,0,chacon3,t3_24sfhy,t1_chacon3,t1_chabl7g,null,1433664542,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

From an educational point of view the first year is about getting everyone up to speed on everything they need to know. Everybody arrives with different A-level subjects and curriculums so half of what you learn you already know, but the half you already know may not be the half the next person already knows.

People calm down and get their heads down as time goes on, but then a new batch of freshers arrive. Just avoid living near them and you'll be fine.

I have been living here for multiple years now, and personally I never experienced anything like this, however this might have to do with me being Dutch and not Polish (Strangely enough they seem to love Dutch people over here, I wonder why!). Do often get asked if I'm Polish by random people that hear my foreign accent, however once you say you are Dutch the mentality seems to change immediately. Unfortunately being Blonde and not looking like a local has the possibility to be mistaken as being Polish, which seems to be enough reason for this scum to throw a brick trough your window (Happened to a few of my Polish neighbors). Overall this is  quite sad because I honestly feel that East Belfast can be a great place to live, and I believe Northern Ireland as a whole could massively benefit from more foreigners moving here. If anything locals should actually hope that more foreigners move to this country, because this is highly beneficial for the poor economy, and brings a lot more diversity which is something that Belfast is really lacking in my opinion. The most amazing thing about this all, is actually that most Polish people living here are hard working people who pay their taxes and attribute to economy of Northern Ireland, while these racists scums seem to be jobless benefit seekers who add nothing to the community at all.

true,docmuppet,eng-sussex,(near) Brighton,"The first and most important piece of advice is stuff you learnt in your A levels is sometimes simplified to the point of being incorrect and the university wants to fix that so pay attention because there will be lots of small things now, also you may have learnt them in A level but due to different grades and exam boards it doesn't mean everyone else did, In my first year I breezed through the psych stuff because I did it at A level while my housemates didn't understand it at all. These small easy things may seem easy and pointless now but by the time you get to 3rd year (where I am now) they won't even be mentioned in the lectures but they still need to mentioned in essays and exams because they are so basic its assumed you know them. First year is all about consolidating knowledge rather than learning new stuff so make sure you are absolutely 100% on everything you do for next year which is a lot harder and 3rd year which will make you want to curl up in a ball and cry (I do so nightly).

Now on to the rest of it:

Halls sucks for some people, put your non-perishable food in your room and lock the door and spend your time at your friends flats or in the library instead, there's nothing you can do about it until you move out in a few months so deal with it and try not to get so angry about things. Drunk people and mess? that's student life for the majority of first years, stop moaning about it and use your ear plugs. Damage to things you can rightly be pissed off with but again, nothing you can do. The more laid back you are about things beyond your control the happier you will be. 

**Universities do not have teachers** they have lecturers, they will stand in front of 30 of you or 300 of you and read out the information you need to know and provide further reading for you to go away and learn yourself, they have no reason to force you to work to pass (unlike teachers) so they treat you as they would in the real world, look out for yourself and get on with it with the information at hand. Professors in general are in that job not to teach but to research so you aren't their primary focus, even the ones who care a lot about students will focus on students in this order: PhD&gt;Masters&gt;3rd year BSc research students (if you have those)&gt;2nd year project students&gt;students they are lecturing. 

I have a lecturer with a very strong russian accent who I struggle to understand so I just ask her to repeat something or I'll send her an email afterwards asking her to clarify something in my notes, do this with your chinese lecturer. You say you are at a top 20 uni so she is likely to be one of the foremost experts in her field in the country.

Polish culture is very different, they have a cuisine that quite different to our own, an accent and language which is hugely different and in many cases they look/dress differently. 

Anyways, all these anecdotes aside, I checked the numbers. Aussie residents have apparently fallen a lot since 2001 because of the global recession and wikipedia suggests that [there are 400,000 Australians in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians_in_the_United_Kingdom). As for Poles, official figures suggest [around 500,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_in_the_United_Kingdom#21st_century_economic_migration) with unofficial sources suggesting it may be double that.

Either way, there are a lot of Aussies in the UK and I repeat my claim that UKIP is demonstrably racist because they have never said a bad thing against these people. The only time they ever mention Austrailia is when they are referencing their own immigration policies. And again they make the same racist claim, because Oz and NZ have EU-like freedom of movement between two culturally similar countries. It's Oz's strict visa attitudes to other migrants that they admire. ",0,1399323466,null,0,false,0,chadbdx,t3_24rnoo,t1_chadbdx,t1_chabvyd,null,1433664840,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Why the fuck did Rodgers break up the Agger/Skrtel partnership that was keeping us clean sheets for these last few games? Our defence has been a mess ever since, and it's legitimately cost us the title for this weird choice of putting what I would say is our 4th best centre back (Toure is better and more reliable imho) in the starting 11 for such important games.

I honestly never want to see Sakho play for Liverpool again, and Mignolet and Johnson are pretty close too.

Downvote me if you want, but I feel I have been vindicated for my comments on Sakho and he has been fully exposed for his shittiness at last.

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"That was a terrible, terrible performance. It highlighted everything that's wrong with our team this season IMO. I can't defend Rodgers or anyone because it was pathetic and we don't deserve to win the title if we think we can play like that and be all right. 

It went from playing lovely, adventurous football to simply trying to defend but failing. We were 3 up -- 3 UP! -- against a Palace side with nothing left to play for this season and they showed us up. If anything, they put us to the sword in that last 15 minutes. 

Did we have a defence? I don't think so. No one picked up Gayle for the third goal, he just stood there and the ball landed at his feet. Bolaise is fast, yes, but why the fuck aren't you basically INSIDE HIM JOHNSON SO HE CAN'T TURN AND RUN?! Suarez wasn't 100% fit and did everything short of asking to come off to highlight that yet Rodgers left him on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, whereas Sturridge looked much more threatening in the last 20 and he's brought off. What the fuck?! 

AND MOSES? MOSES?! I like the lad, but he's not someone you bring on to defend a slim 2-3 scoreline! He's a player that comes on when we're 6-0 up so he can't fuck anything up too badly. Bring Agger on! Hell, even bring fucking Kolo on, it's better than Moses! 

One more thing -- Sterling, why you no run? You got the ball in miles of space yet sauntered and looked for a deadening pass? why? why? please God, I need answers. 

Apart from that, I thought it was a fantastic performance (sarcasm).

EDIT: OH GOD, I REMEMBERED ABOUT JOHNSON. He wasn't right-back tonight, he was basically another striker. Yes, you like to get up the pitch, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET BACK BECAUSE WE NEED DEFENDERS. This was by far the most embarrassing result of our season so far and, of course, it couldn't have come at a more crucial time.

Comp Sci at Manchester was my dream place. I should have had doubts when they didn't ask me for an interview, and just said ""yep, we'll take you"" when they saw my marks (this was early 2000's, not recently). But I was just happy to get in.

I was almost certainly already depressed at that point, but it got a lot worse as time went on. I felt isolated even though I was surrounded by people. I couldn't talk to anyone (damn that social anxiety). Most lectures were in a massive lecture theatre that was practically full at all times, but I never felt more alone.

I kept up with the course through it all, so I don't expect anyone noticed that I was struggling since I was still getting everything done. Then I started to dread coming in, and having panic attacks. My parents found out I was struggling emotionally, and got me to the doctor. I was diagnosed and given anti-depressants. Told them I didn't want to go back, I hated it.

I had a meeting with my course head, my mum was there, and all I can remember is him asking one question ""What are you going to do when you leave?"" I replied ""don't know"", and that was it, I was out. No attempt to help me or give any guidance.

20 months is how long it took from that point to applying to Lancaster to do Physics, the difference was night and day. My interview was with the head of the department and he was a great guy. I applied, had my interview, and was accepted about 2-3weeks before the start of term. Everyone was friendly and there were loads of meet and greets.

true,bzva74,null,null,"Bentaleb. I frequently see jokes about how Sherwood played Bentaleb all the time and Bentaleb this and Bentaleb that and Bentaleb basically got sucked into the anti-Sherwood circlejerk.

People complained about how we have such capable senior players who should be playing midfield. Bentaleb showed passion. He wasn't afraid to take a crack at goal (and hit the woodwork a couple of times). He had some flair with his distribution (more decisive passing than our other CMs IMO, plus his assist to Chadli vs Newcastle was a beauty). His vision is great and his strength is surprising. He doesn't get pushed off the ball and is great in possession, like Dembele. He is fast enough to track back and even catch up to speedy wingers (2 great tackles on our flank while covering for Danny ""somersault"" Rose in Lisbon, for example). And then guys like Paulinho flinch in the wall and...well... I'd bet my scrotum that Bentaleb would take the ball to the abdomen/groin with nothing more than a bestial roar to strike the fear of the Algerian Mahdi to the core of Stewart Downing's overvalued, pathetic little heart. Alas, I am getting carried away. 

Bentaleb is a very solid DM/CM, and even has the tools to transition to AM or winger (his run and cross for Adebayor goal vs newcastle is an example). If we get a Dutch-style manager, we will need players who can transition seamlessly from one role to another. Tbh guys like Dembele and Sandro may be less preferable to more versatile players like Bentaleb and Holtby IMO (in some matchups, but not all!). 

I know some people are like ""i like bentaleb, I just don't think he should have been playing against City and Arsenal! He should have been put in Europa squads to get eased in!"" Please. Playing City and Arsenal made bentaleb better. Recently we talked about who should be our captain, and Bentaleb was brought up (much, MUCH further down the road). If he didn't get 14 starts in some of our biggest matches this year across 3 different competitions, he wouldn't even be in the equation next year. We would be shipping him on the next bus to Swindon Town if we weren't patient with his development. He turned into a fantastic, probably (eventually) top 4 level midfielder. This is a guy who in the span of 3 months went from no-name U-21 midfielder to a 90-minute starter on Algerias national team in their friendly vs Slovenia. Idk for sure, but I presume he will start in the World Cup for Algeria. This is a 19 year old who will star in a world cup midfield. And instead of embracing him as the next big Tottenham star (im not jumping to conclusions, just raising the possibility), we lumped him with sherwood and made nepotism jokes. We whined about Holtby being loaned out for more PT and Sandro being benched because he was injured and Paulinho not playing because he didn't care in practice. And now look at us. 

Remember those games against Southampton and Newcastle and Everton and Benfica and Arsenal where even if we didn't win, we at least showed heart and passion for the shirt? Compare that to the past few weeks with West Brom, Stoke, Fulham, West Ham...where's the heart? 

[Controversial opinion incoming] Bentaleb will show his class in the world cup and it would be a huge mistake to loan him out. If he is given a chance he will easily be a starting-caliber CM in the premier league. And he's 19 years old.

2 - Pritchard for Chadli. My suspicion is that Chadli picked up a knock against Stoke given as he wasn't even on the bench against West Ham, and we were thin at CM and winger as was. Also, given that our league position is relatively safe and Villa are now safe from relegation, I think Pritch deserves the reward of a Prem debut after the season he's had at Swindon. Also, Pritch plays a position that I'm sure we'll be looking at in the summer anyway, so it would be to our advantage to let him have a run out. He can't do much worse than our other LW options after Eriksen, and he seems the type to get stuck in regardless.

Also, there's a decent chance that Vertonghen would be healthy after playing for the reserves, so of course if he's healthy I'd like to see him in there as well. Unfortunately because of the Townsend injury, he's not an option either and so Lennon is inevitably the choice there.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Hey OP, I really hope you get to read this. I spent 8 years at university finishing last year. I had a lot of good and bad experiences in that time, so I hope I write with some qualification on the subject. 


**A bit about my experiences:** When I first went to university I actually didn't go into halls (it was the year before tuition fees went up to £3000, so there were more places given out than there were rooms on campus). I ended up lodging for the first 2 weeks with this old couple - it was a total nightmare but I then moved out and got a house with 3 other freshers in a similar position to me. We ended up having one of the best houses I ever lived in. It was small and a bit damp, but it was ours and the first time I'd had that kind of total freedom. When I did my second degree I went back into halls largely as I felt I'd missed out the first time round. I didn't really gel as well with the people I lived with and developed closer friendships with my course-mates. In retrospect I wished I'd just got a rental house from the start. 

I did a hard-science course and those tend to be better taught than computing or humanities, but never the less many of the lecturers were punishingly substandard. Most were totally preoccupied with their laboratories and only did the minimum amount of teaching in order to draw a ""lecturer"" salary. Similarly a lot of the seminars/tutorials were directed by PhD students also more focused on getting some dollar than in being an effective educator.

**Regarding your issues:** One of the things I have come to appreciate having spent more than my fair share of time in higher education, is that the beauty of university is you can **have it your way**. Any notion that you have to live in halls, or even with other students, to go out and drink yourself stupid etc. is entirely self imposed. There is nothing to stop you getting a 2/3 bedroom flat with some friends or a few randoms and doing it your way. If you aren't big drinkers - don't drink. If you like playing monopoly, play monopoly together. If you're interested in films, get a fuck off big TV and watch films. You have the power to make the experience what you want. All you have to do is rock up to university, sit through the lectures and do the assignments. 

Regarding university, this one is tricky. I learnt a lot of niche technical skills that I haven't really used since, and some that I have. But the real power of university is that it gave me a solid amount of time to do what I actually wanted - which in my case was to program and to paint. I would incorporate these at every opportunity into my university work. So for example if I was writing an essay on a biochemistry lab I had done, you could bet my essay would be the one with beautiful self-drawn illustrations. Quite a few of the lecturers were actually very keen on this, and on a couple of occasions I even made illustrations for them to. 

 In my spare time (of which I had a lot!) I spent time coding for websites and generally mucking around with softer languages like jQuery and Javascript. At the time I think it seemed like I was just killing-time waiting to graduate, but in reality it was actually part of a process of developing my own skills and creating my own niche. As it turns out a lot of scientists can't draw and can't program for toffee, so those things were part of a process where I was carving out my own unique skillset. 

Anyway, the key to being good at anything essentially boils down to time investment. People who are good at things are generally good because they put the hours in. This is your opportunity to do whatever you want - and I don't mean that in a pressured way. Put up with shit lecturers + get a decent house next year and **start living**. Find things about computer science you enjoy and do them, develop them and improve upon them. You won't fully appreciate it now, but in a few years when you get sucked into a &gt;60 hour a week job, you just won't have the energy/passion or mental space to come home from work and invest what little time off you have into hobbies. It strikes me that your problems are 90% related to accommodation, and that's just exacerbating some minor disgruntlement with the courses shortcomings (which aren't insignificant, but are possibly tolerable?)",0,1399326309,null,0,1399326584,0,chaerzv,t3_24s9g9,t1_chaerzv,t3_24s9g9,null,1433665598,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Flanno playing inside out as a LB also posses another problem. He has to turn in, and we have seen his passes being intercepted as he brings the ball back from the left sideline to the middle.

true,IIAOPSW,uk,"""the states""... don't look at me like that","&gt;radiation has a half life

It would be more accurate to say radioactive substances have a half life. If I have 1 kg of Uranium, and I wait around for its half life, I will now have half a kg of Uranium. Wait another half life and I have a quarter. Radiation is the result of a substance decaying. So if one thing has a half life of 10 seconds, and another has a half life of 1 second, the 10 second object will be less radioactive (release less radiation per unit time) all else being equal. 

There are 2 important facts you are missing.  

The first is that different radioactive substances have different half lives. Uranium 238 (the most common isotope) has a half life of 4468000000 years. Uranium 235 (the type used in reactors for fission) has a half life of 703000000 years. Carbon-10 on the other hand has a half life of 20 seconds. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_radioactive_isotopes_by_half-life  

The second fact is that when an nucleus undergoes radioactive decay, it doesn't simply disappear. It has what are called daughter products. If the decay type is alpha emission, the new nucleus is the old minus 2 neutrons and 2 protons. If the decay type is beta the new nucleus is the old minus 1 neutron and plus 1 proton. However the new nucleus can also be radioactive. The result is what is called a ""decay chain"" of one type of substance decaying into another decaying into another until it reaches a stable point. Here is what it looks like for Uranium. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain#Radium_series_.28also_known_as_uranium_series.29.

So the short lived, heavily radioactive stuff does in fact dies out quickly. By the time you reach dry storage, you're on long lived daughter products.

So to sum it up in an apt analogy: the brightest flame burns out quickest. However you can have candles which last for days. Both flames will burn you if you touch them.

true,DarkCrick,eng-lancashire,Preston,"(I'm a 3rd year fire engineering student graduating from UCLAN this year)

The summary is: It gets better in second year. 

Accommodation:

1. First year everyone is new and hasn't settled in to the differences yet, so you still end up with a few idiots fresh out of high school that love mock people who actually do work, that only came to uni because they had nothing better to do. Most of them grow up once the work hits and the ones that don't probably won't make it past first year.

2. 
Drinking is a big part of student culture and the noise/mess is just something you have to put up with. Most students turned 18 the year before and uni is their first real freedom, partying is expected. If its a real problem you can sometimes move to quieter halls, but its a bit late in the year now. Next year you said you have a house which will generally be quieter (unless you're unlucky and have noisy neighbours). Just remember security is a bigger problem once your in a house instead of halls.

3. Food going missing is shit, its theft plain and simple. You get put in a flat with randomers in first year and sometimes that means living with shit people. I was lucky and had a great bunch but I know plenty of others who were unlucky. If you don't do anything about it quickly its very difficult as it can seem like you're over-reacting to small incidents when you're not. Living with new people is tricky and there will always be disagreements. You're living with friends next year so that problem goes away for the most (there will still be disagreements about washing up and countless other things, just not as bad). If you have space keep some stuff locked in your room where its more secure, its not the ideal solution but it is the easiest.

4. Most of the time if you break something in your room, you pay for if. In your shared kitchen/bathroom, everyone in the flat pays for it. In your shared common room, everyone in the building pays for it. The only exception is if someone stands up and takes the blame. Unfortunately the people who break things are usually the same people that have no problem with making everyone else pay for it. Its a cost of living in shared spaces when you don't choose who you're with. Once again its bad luck but living with friends next year will be better.

5. If somebody reported the damage then I can see why it was replaced even if it was still functional. Being given one without a freezer isn't right and you should complain about that. That's a big fault from your accommodation team. The higher price is likely because they have an approved supplier for everything which might be more expensive, and they might also include labour costs in their bill to you. 

6. Fire alarms going off are an unfortunate part of shared living. Some people are idiots, others just made a mistake. Its just another problem that goes away once you live in a smaller house (unless your friends are terrible cooks). I'd be curious to know how it managed to smoke out all 3 floors, that's exactly what shouldn't happen.

7. I don't know anything about catered accommodation

8. Again, drunks can do stupid things. In my first year halls someone rode down the stairs in a kayak and smashed through the lower half of a door. As long as it hasn't inconvenienced you just laugh at the stories.

9. (and 10) Once again, bad luck of living with people you didn't choose, its always a small number of idiots who ruin it for everyone else. If there was as much damage as you said then the people responsible will have had consequences unless you're university is completely incompetent.

11. see 4


Teaching:

1. Remember you get a lot of facilities outside of teaching such as library, SU, gym, etc.

2. It's common for first year to simply bring everyone to the same level and not include much difficult work. I had the exact same issue with maths since I also did it at A level. However most of my class didn't have the maths background and struggled with it. There were other parts of first year I struggled with that others found easy. The real work starts in second and third year.

3. Inconsistent marking isn't good but sometimes there are reasons. Some lectures mark purely by assignments, some add weight with in class contributions, some are unfortunately biased and mark with personal preference. There are assignments I submitted in first year where I was disappointed with the grade, that now with 2 years more experience I realise that I'd actually done things wrong. Most first years don't count towards your final grade, so if it was an isolated incident I'd be tempted to just call it bad luck.

4. Programming is a difficult subject to make interesting, robotic style isn't surprising. At university level you aren't going to be spoonfed all of the information like you are in lower school, independent learning is expected. Your lecturer with give you basics, you learn the rest yourself, and you use them as a source to answer any questions or problems that you have. They're more of a guide than a teacher.

5. If the resources aren't giving you all the information you need then make sure to question your lectures when you can, including office hours. Take the resources with you if possible. Telling them that you think that the resources are shit probably won't get you very far, instead try ""I'm really struggling to wrap my head around this topic, I've tried reading [insert inappropriate resource] but I'm still not sure, could you explain it again"". Point out the problems with the material without criticising them directly. Generally your lecturers will be very knowledgeable, unfortunately this doesn't always translate to being a good teacher as well.

6. Lectures plugging their own books isn't surprising, I was warned of that as well before I started uni but luckily never experienced it. Just be glad you're not in america with £1000's of mandatory textbook fees.

7. Sometimes difficult work that throws you in at the deep end is just too see how well you swim (although other times it can be poor teaching). Your lectures won't give you the answers to assignment questions but they should give you general guidance if you ask. Get used to working with groups and learning each others strengths. You will be expected to solve a lot of problems on your own, independence is a big part of higher learning.

8. Can't really help with foreign lecturers, I have the same problem. We have a Chinese lecturer who everyone really struggles to understand and in first year we all thought was ridiculous. We also had pretty much the entire group leave part way through. It's a shame because from talking to other lecturers it seems that he is an incredibly clever person, just with a strong accent.

- Big Andy will win it for us this year. Aren't I allowed to dream?

In a way it's a bad message to football everywhere to say that we can play a full season of just a crap load of goals and not care about our defence, it hasn't even been as bad as some people claim just in the big matches such as right now with Crystal Palace where Skrtel/Johnson was nowhere to be seen in their defensive line.

Which should already be telling you something about your tolerance for risk regarding this money. Obviously you can make less risky choices (don't even think of opening an S&amp;S ISA if you can't distinguish between stocks and bonds).

true,Horontobosh,lfc12,,"I was fortunate to get invited to West Ham away in the 09-10 season by a friend of Gianfranco Zola. We watched the game in Zola's personal box with his wife and sons. It was the game that ended 3-2, I think - Babel crossed for a Torres winner. We got taken down into the manager's room after the game and met Zola who was a lovely guy. Very nice, all smiles. I sat down at the back of the room with one of Zola's sons (17 yo back then and playing for West Ham youth). It was weird being in that situation. It got weirder when Sammy Lee walked in and went straight to the kit man for some red wine. He didn't pay any attention to me. It got more surreal when Rafa Benitez walked in. And I couldn't believe it when Kenny walked in a minute later. The relationship between those two was fantastic to see. They were like two school children. Rafa grabbed the back of Kenny's neck and they sort of wrestled a bit. I remember reading later in the papers that Rafa had apparently banned Kenny from Melwood. What a load of shit. 
I looked over at my friend, who was talking to Zola and he kept shaking his head for me to go over to Rafa and Kenny. I thought 'fuck it'. I got up and strolled over like I was supposed to be in that room. I approached the legendary pair and interrupted their conversation. They both looked at me with the same sort of 'who the fuck are you' stare. I apologised, said hello and sat back down. I know what I wanted to say but when you're in that position I bottled it. I don't think they even knew I was a Liverpool fan (I was instructed not to wear any red/kit).

Things got really interesting after that. Sammy Lee kept going back for the red wine and Rafa got into a conversation (one way) about the problems surrounding Liverpool. How the banks were taking all the money. He talked about Alonso for a bit, saying some really eye opening info that Alonso had an agreement with Arsenal the season before. I know it was sensitive stuff because Sammy Lee kept looking over at me, perhaps two or three times, probably making sure I wasn't recording. I sat there and pretended to watch Skysports on the tv behind Zola. He also talked about Man Utd and you could hear how passionate he was. I felt sorry for Zola who was still smiling despite Rafa burning his ear off. He talked about some more things but it was all quite overwhelming to be there and to take it in. Rafa and Kenny came around the room and said goodbye to everyone. I said it was a pleasure to meet them both. I don't remember Sammy Lee leaving. And from somewhere Steve Clarke appeared and sat on a sofa looking very down. I walked over said ""Shame we didn't have time to chat. Sorry about the result. Nice to meet you.""

I left with my friend and as we were trying to find the exit Fernando Torres strode towards us. What an athlete that guy is. He was massive. My friend stopped him for an autograph. I got in on the act and I tapped him three times on the shoulder and said ""Thanks Fernando"". Next game he scored a hattrick. We found the exit and walked straight into the Liverpool coach. We turned around and almost bumped into Fabio Aurelio who was staring straight at me in a sort of 'what the fuck are you doing' look. He's tiny. I mean really small. After that we found the car and drove home. I still can't really believe that day.",0,1399329583,null,0,false,0,chagbz8,t3_24s5cy,t1_chagbz8,t3_24s5cy,null,1433666331,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

BUT...

The season's aim was to finish top four.  We have blown that target right out of the water.

We have champions league football, so no longer do we lose potential signings because they want to play in the champions league.

MCFC and CFC have massive quality in their squad depth . Yes they'll strengthen, but so will LFC.  We have more room to grow the squad then either of those two teams. Next years squad might still not be worth as much, or even as strong on paper as either of those two teams, but it will be closer than this year and we've taken it to the wire with what we have this time.

It's not over until it's over. Out of our hands, yes. But if you'd have said we'd be mathematically in with a shout on the last day at the start of the season, no one would have believed that.

This squad has given us a season to be proud of despite tonight's result, and regardless of how the final table transpires. It isn't nice to be upset about getting so close but not winning, but I'd take that over the last 5 years worth of seasons.

So, yes, tonight hurts. But it's great to back where we have a season to still feel emotional about when it's already May.

true,smaclver,null,null,"Let me quote PhaseOfPlay, RAWK's own football professional, a man so erudite and knowledgeable he could teach zonal marking to an under 6 team in his sleep.

&gt;My point is that the style of play influences the probability of errors - if you set up in a defensive block of two lines of four, you will have less individual errors that cause goals (because there will always be close enough cover to prevent single  mistakes costing goals), than if you play a pure attacking game like we do, where the players ahead of the ball outnumber the players behind it. This isn't specifically related to the Cardiff game, but in an overall sense. We take risks in our style of play that our defenders will win the ball back, so we can push more players forward. It means that when we lose the ball there are smaller margins of error from our defenders, and this proves to be the case. Even when the ball reaches our defensive third, we are still more interested in the counterattack than we are in blocking the route to goal. 

&gt;Look at it this way. There is a ""funnel"" that coaches use to teach defensive shape. It extends from the corners of the halfway line and side line, to the corners of the 6 yard box and goal line. This gives defenders and teams a visual cue for how the team compresses as it comes closer to goal (and how it opens out as it goes closer to the halfway line on attack). 

&gt;If we look at a traditional 4-5-1 defending team, they will compress up to 9 players, but usually 8, into this funnel, and leave the winger to patrol the line with the fullback. If an overlap occurs, they can sacrifice the fullback to go out and defend, and still retain solid numbers in the ""funnel"" and the box:

https://31.media.tumblr.com/e393323106e5775b85700091ca7cc699/tumblr_n2y1s0bjJC1sf5t8bo1_500.png

&gt;They can also send a midfielder out to do the same job. Essentially though, they always have good numbers on the line of the ball, and at least two lines of coverage behind the pressing/containing defender. 

&gt;Compare this to an attacking team, like the one we have under Rodgers:

https://31.media.tumblr.com/0850b2096364721bf0eb5e65b1afd8aa/tumblr_n2y1ueXWyO1sf5t8bo1_500.png

&gt;This version relies on the back four, doesn't require the far side winger to also drop back, and doesn't put heavy midfield numbers in front of the back four. So instead of defending with 8 or 9 players, we defend with 6 or 7. This means there is more space in between the lines, which means there is a greater chance of an individual error happening, as defenders will be pulled out of position far easier as they slide across to cover if the containing/pressing defender is beaten each time (Cardiff's first goal was a good example of that). The flip side, though, is that if we win the ball, we are 5v5 on the counter, instead of 1v4. So our counterattacks have more threat. This has the domino effect of the opposition then having to drop more defenders back, which takes away from their attack, which means we gain ""more"" coverage in the attack, as there are less threats to worry about. 

&gt;So individual errors are key, as they are with most goals. But style of play and balance of attack and defence also play a part in those errors, because the style of play and balance of attack/defence dictates the spaces that have to be covered, by how many players, and what the margins of error are as a result.",0,1399331399,null,0,1399332346,0,chah5q5,t3_24tamo,t1_chah5q5,t1_chag2o2,null,1433666720,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

--- **Glen Johnson hits out at fans**

After a crushing defeat for a red faced Liverpool Glen Johnson took on the fans in a twitter barrage calling out sofa experts and calling fans 'clueless'.

Liverpool led by three goals and looked set to take three points from the game when they were hit with gayle force winds when substitute Dwight Gayle formed a comeback for Crystal Palace by taking on a shakey Liverpool defence and blasting home two goals to humiliate goal keeper Simon Mignolet.

Luis Suarez was forced to look on as his team conceded three goals and the striker was unable to create some of the magic moments seen this season, obviously devastated by this the player was inconsolable at the end of the game, one player who is close to the nan of the brother who knows the dog of the wife of the sister who knows his aunts son who knows Suarez's agent has reported that Suarez may look to leave the Reds this season in an attempt to win silverware whilst he is at the top of his game. 

Glen Johnson swiftly took to twitter to slam fans by calling them clueless and branded them as having no idea about football what so ever, angry fans hit back in what was a war of the words with many fans outraged by the comments. 

Glen Johnson who has been out of form for Liverpool this season may be set to leave Liverpool this season with Brendan Rodgers looking to bring in new players and shake things up. 

An agent totally unrelated to Glen Johnson has said that It is likely that the player will look to move on in the summer. 

Man City who are now set to take title will be pleased at the crumble of Liverpool and Pellegrini will look on as players turn against fans in an all out war where the words are the weapons.



........^^^^ Genuinely bound to see something like that.

In an incredible turn of events however, a recent undercover photograph can reveal that Jan is 100% committed to the club, is enjoying his football and has had a wonderful season as the fan's favourite player.

Fuck it though, I'm in a slightly particular position so this advice probably doesn't extend all the way to you. I think my point is that you're going to regret not making the most of your time at uni (and I've heard this from so many people). Find something you love and get working on it, or if you already have something you love, get really good at it. 

I was in a fairly similar position to you in my first term of the first year (second year now) but I figured just being sad about it didn't help. I still have no great love for my course but I've found that the vast majority of people feel the same way. Now I just get on with it and in my spare time (which is plentiful because I'm really not at most of my lectures and we don't have many hours in the first place) I do the things I love to do and I'm getting much better at them. 

Figure out what you want and work around your current situation to get there. It isn't going to change, you have to. If you want to go into a particular career then start focusing on that so that when you graduate you're already ahead of the game. 

To be honest, it doesn't matter what you're doing, just be doing *something* and make sure you make the most of the time you have to do that thing in.

I'm also itching for a return to some semblance of football ""the West Ham way"".

-Make every effort to re-sign Reid. Make every effort to bring Ravel back into the fold. I think Ravel is easier to do without Sam and Nolan. His creativity was sorely lacking this year.

-Find starting quality fullbacks. Armero might be the solution, but Linda and Guy are getting long in the tooth. They won't offer much for much longer.

-Find a goal poacher. That won't matter if we keep playing one up top. Hopefully a new manager will change the tactics up a bit and have someone either playing with Andy or behind him. Either would be better than the hoof-ball we've got going on now.

-Find another winger. Downing played very well this season (ignore his goal tally). Diame and Jarvis did not. We need another winger. I'm hoping for one with pace and crossing ability, though that might be too much to ask.

There are employers using zero-hours contracts who make their employees call each morning to see if they're required **that day**.  The one I know of was exceedingly proud of the fact that this gave them total control of their workforce.

The damage it does to those employees is neither here nor there to this sort of people.

There has been for years - A decade at least - An issue of employment agencies advertising jobs through Job Centres that don't exist.  They do it to get people in the system to expand the pool of people they can try to put into a placement.  The possibility of their being able to take people on on zero-hours contracts knowing people can be punished for refusing is terrifying.

Aston Villa and Hull City will compete this summer to sign Kevin Vogt, the highly-rated Germany Under-21 midfielder from Augsburg.

With Premier League safety now assured for both sides, they are looking to their summer recruitment and have identified 22-year-old Vogt as one of their main targets.

Vogt, thought of as one of the most promising young midfielders in Germany, has been an important part of the Augsburg side who are set for the best season in their history. They are currently eighth in the Bundesliga, in their third season in the top flight, just one point away from a Europa League place, with three games left.

Augsburg have become one of the league’s most exciting counter-attacking sides under young coach Markus Weinzierl, and Vogt has been a key part of their progress. The 6ft 5in holding midfielder has impressed with his workrate, and his defensive and creative abilities. He has made 27 appearances in the Bundesliga this season.

Vogt began his career as a centre-back in the Bochum academy, alongside İlkay Gündogan, now at Borussia Dortmund, and  Matthias Ostrzolek, a left-back who is now also at Augsburg. Vogt broke into the Bochum first team as a teenager before joining Augsburg in summer 2012. He has represented Germany at Under-18, Under-19, Under-20 and Under-21 levels.

Spurs up until this season were under this delusion that they had 'arrived' and were competing for CL as if by rights. They've spent an absolute fortune on incoming talent over the past 5 seasons and this season it's crystallised that they haven't actually made good on all the hype and Everton have leapfrogged them despite not having the financial backing.

So what do they do? They revel in the misfortune of Liverpool who they thought they'd come to overtake just because of a few inflated league performances that came with papering over the cracks in their football by throwing money at it. That's now moot and they're hurting so they're turning that on the likes of Liverpool.

Much the same with Arsenal fans. You know there's something very rotten at the core of your club when all you obsess over is fiscal prudence and qualifying for the CL every season despite never coming close to actually competing in it but merely making up the numbers.

How would you feel if you moved into a new mega-stadium, constantly brought in so-called superstar talent yet couldn't compete with the teams you used to be up there rubbing shoulders with anymore? Just watching from the sidelines as you lie to yourself with that tired old line about CL qualification being all that matters... as your silverware cabinet grew dusty with each passing season... 

So, let the cunts revel- their hatred is merely their own :)

Edit: oh and just in case any of their fans give any of you stick, just send them these little reminders...

true,64diamonds,null,null,"12-mark questions ask you for a balanced answer. This means that you have to offer both sides of the argument.

In this post I'm typing up, 'A' and 'B' are two seperate sides of the argument. 'C' is the conclusion.

For example, if the question was 'Would most sociologists agree that women's roles have changed significantly in the last 50 years?'. Argument A could be that 'women's roles have changed significantly in the last 50 years'. In which case, B would be that 'women's roles have not changed.'

**Structure:**

* **First paragraph:** One well-explained point for side A of the argument. Use sociological language. For example, the 'triple shift.' Also remember to give examples in your answer. For example, give examples of what work women do in the home (cleaning and childcare).

* **Second paragraph:** One well-explained point for side B of the argument. Again, use sociological language. Use examples.

* **Third paragraph:** Ideally another side A point. Use sociological lang...you get the idea.

* **Fourth paragraph:** Ideally another side B point.

* **Fifth paragraph:** Conclusion. Bring your answer to a close by coming to a judgement. For example, a good conclusion for the question I provided above would be that 'women's roles have changed significantly in the home, but they still do more domestic work than men.' Do **not** simply repeat what you have said before in your answer.

If you don't have time to do that much, try doing at least one point for both sides of the argument (or two points for A and one point for B, etc.). You can still get a maximum of nine marks for writing one point for both sides of the argument.

There you go! Do all of that right and you will get top marks. I'm lucky enough to have an exceptional teacher that really teaches me and the rest of my class how to answer each type of question in detail.

And it's the students I don't hear from that worry me most of all because I know they are probably dealing with stuff like you've had to but aren't bringing it to anyone's attention.

Realistically it is probably too late to do anything about past incidents if they aren't recurring (e.g. if food going missing was one-off or the fact that it was noisy one night in December…), but for anything that is ongoing it is definitely worth brining up. Also, smashing up the common room is a pretty big deal. 

If I were you I'd put all of this stuff in an email to the SU (cc in the accommodation manager) so they know the history and tell them you're not happy with your experience (management do REALLY care about ""student experience"" because that matters for uni league tables and internal funding so they should take it seriously). Tell them the accommodation office didn't provide you with sufficient information on where to get help (e.g. wardens are not visible, you didn't know about student services, etc), that they charged you for ridiculous things that you weren't responsible for (which made you less likely to seek help from the accommodation office when you needed it for stuff like antisocial behaviour), and that they generally made your life as a student very difficult throughout your first year of uni (which is the time when you need the most support). And of course they charged you however many thousands of pounds for the luxury of all of the above. That should certainly get their attention and you should hopefully see some results.

If you fail to see results from any of that, just go to the media. Bad press is what every university is most terrified of!",0,1399336311,null,0,1399336577,0,chajdpi,t3_24s9g9,t1_chajdpi,t1_chaiqik,null,1433667768,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
