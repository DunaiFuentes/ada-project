true,We_Flatten_Stuff,null,null,"Hi, sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you and thanks for taking the time to read this!

 First I'd like to say that I notice you've put $500 - I'm speaking from a UK perspective so what I say will be largely applicable but I can't say that it will be the exact same case in the US (though it probably is). Take my comments into consideration but I cannot garuantee anything I'm afraid!

 (unrelated to question but...) As you appear to be aware, taking out any CREDIT whatsoever, so getting finance on that car or even getting another monthly direct debit for something is strong advised against when applying for a mortgage and buying a house. So it's good to hear that you're aware of this already and are taking steps to avoid it. Lenders are able to credit search their applicants whenever they like and are well within their rights to pull the mortgage offer you have at any time up to completion on a property even if you have exchanged. You're right to avoid credit searches and other things that may have any negative impact on your credit score (as having too many credit searches within a period of time can do to) in the run up to completion to avoid giving the lender any inkling that you might not be able to actually afford what you have said you can or that you're searching for other forms of credit to be able to buy other things that will add costs along side the mortgage you want.

 In relation to the actual debit transaction on the card, it doesn't appear to be something to worry about. The bank isn't monitoring your accounts 24/7 ready to scrutinise everything and now that they have already cleared you for a mortgage offer, i.e they have said they are happy to lend (which I assume is the case being so close to completion) then they are very very unlikely to ask to take another look at your accounts. They would only possibly do this if they had a really strong suspiscion that you were doing something shady or may not be everything you claim. If it ever did come to the bank asking for further information 9/10 times they just want up to date payslips to prove that you're still earning the same money - that's usually only asked for if the mortgage offer you have expires. If they did ever end up seeing the transaction before completion they typically only ask for a verbal explanation and confirmation that it's just a one off payment. In short, don't worry about it - the dealership didn't do a credit check and it's unlikely the lender will see the transaction. Would it raise red flags for them? Only if you said ""Yeah that's a deposit for a car where the leasing costs will make it a really close run thing to afford this mortgage."" - then you might have a problem.

 My take one this: you're in the home straight to getting the house, the lender will likely never see nor hear about this single transaction. They may re-credit score you but the dealership didn't so it won't show up that you have even spoken to them. Provided you're confident that you can afford the mortgage and leasing side by side there shouldn't be any problem. Please remain cautious though.

(Having said that I thought Coutinho was a huge gamble and not worth 8 million as I thought he wouldn't be good for us so what would I know).

Also his reputation in Portugal is something positive as well. Many people say that Markovic is one of the best young players in the world however I have heard others say he's shite. I tend not to agree with either extreme as I believe that he is decent as it is and can grow however I dont think he's in that top 10 bracket of best young players (yet).

I think City will be worse than last year. Aguero seems to be struggling with injury and Negredo isn't doing much any more. Their midfield is reliant on Yaya Touré, who can be a colossus, but maybe he'll get injured or something. I still expect them to finish above us.

Liverpool have added solid but mostly unspectacular depth. It's not out of the question that they'll ""do a Spurs"". From an attack perspective I think Rodgers has bought players that fit the system, but I still expect a small drop-off. Their weakness was the defence and it seems like they've made some smart moves to shore that up. Top 4. 

Chelsea will win the league.

Arsenal...a lot depends on how Rambo does. They really missed him after his injury. I don't think there's much doubt that Sanchez will be good, but he might not be *great*. They're on a par with Liverpool.

United will be markedly better, of course. I think their defence, unless they invest in the coming weeks, will prevent them from making the top 4. Smalling/Shaw, Jones, Evans, Rafael as a back 4 just doesn't cut it. Losing Vidic, Ferdinand and Evra will hurt them, perhaps more than most expect. Herrera is the key man. 

And us.

It could all come together. I really think it could. I think the key men for us will be Vertonghen, Capoue, Eriksen and Adebayor. I don't think we saw Capoue anywhere near at his best last season. I also expect Soldado to be more confident and to receive better service, and for Lamela to live up to his name, as opposed to just the first four letters of it. Lamela will be the break-out player but the season will live and die on the CAVE (Capoue, Ade, Vert, Eriksen...) core.

I expect Davies to perform about as well as Assou-Ekotto did at his peak, which was actually pretty damn decent. The little I have seen of Davies reminds me of Benny quite a lot.

Its with great sadness that I must inform you all of the tragic death of FAIR member Ossy Bradley who just a few hours ago was drowned whilst performing a selfless act of citizenship in Bessbrook. Ossy who worked tirelessly for victims in the area attempted to remove two Irish Tricolours from an Island in the towns pond and replace them with Union Jacks. The two Irish Tricolours had been reported and indeed they should have been removed but were not. Regrettably Ossy was then forced into taking matters into his own hands and tragically died as a consequence. A great friend of Mrs Lemon (Kingsmills massacre) Ossy was all to aware of how much hurt these foreign flags were causing and the IRAs message that they were delivering to the local unionist community. I at this time call for funding to be given to the IRA victims of that area who have no support group, no one who could have taken up such matters and seen them resolved. Tragically we now see the death of a man due to republican intimidation and the governments attempted “silencing” of IRA victims. As we have always said the victims will not be going away and we will not tolerate republican intimidation. FOOTNOTE, this evening the council sent men over in canoes and removed the tricolors.

They have many roots: Celtic Britain, the Roman invasion, the Norman invasion, and immigration in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries are just a few. All have changed over time and to create the society we live in today. Like a living creature, we should cherish all these cultures, and the traditions that stem from them, as they are unique, and have evolved to create the country we live in today.

Nationalists don't care about that. Nationalists care about national solidarity. They want everyone to have the same culture, the same values, the same identity. They do not care about the culture of the UK, old or new, they only care about their own. Do you think Nick Griffin lamented the death of the last Cromarty fisherfolk dialect speaker in 2012, making it an extinct language? Do you think Jim Dowson cares that traditional Guy Fawkes night bonfire, that used to be wide spread, can now only be found in few British towns, like Lewes? No, they are too busy attacking Muslims and foreigners for being against British culture, while they ignore the natural changes in British culture happening right under their feet.

Nationalism and caring about culture are complete oxymorons. You cannot have national values and national culture without trampling over all other regional values and culture. Of course I support everyone in the country, of different cultures and backgrounds, working together, but I don't support nationalism, which imposes cultures upon them.

City centre or close to it is probably your best bet. Then you have easy access to everything. But the costs can be higher there. But manageable if you live with one or two others. Down by the docks they have some nice apartments.

If living out of the city centre Mossley Hill, Wavertree and Aigburth are all decent places to live. Woolton and Childwall too. All have good public transport. Some with buses. Others buses and trains.

Despite what someone else said about Toxteth being a bad area, the part nearer the city centre has actually been gentrified with a lot of the old merchant houses converted into flats. Thats actually a very nice area to live and within walking distance of the city centre. The other part of Toxteth is still fairly rough however.

Hope you like your visit here. It is a great place to live with some of the most friendly people you will meet and tourism parts aside we have a great deal of culture through our museums, art galleries and theatres. Great pubs and bars and music venues too.

And it was not 100's of years ago as you falsely claim. A real genocide is still going on with these people, unlike your fictional imaginary Palestinian genocide.

Life expectancy of Aboriginals is up to 20 years less than average for Australia.

In some Canadian provinces Native Indians that make up only 10% of the population make up 90% of the prison population.

Aboriginals and Canadian Indians have suicide rates, drug and alcohol addiction rates, poverty and disease rates many times that of average citizens.

Merlin's other name, Emrys, or Ambrosius, is not a druidic name

Merlin's father is an incubus, not a dragon tamer.

Merlin is an adult and fully fledged magic user when he first meets Uther.

There are two dragons under Uther's castle, while he's buidling it, a red one and a white one. These are said to be analogous to the two sides of the war of the roses. Merlin helps Uther get rid of them.

Arthur is the son of Uther and a woman that Uther made love to while magically disguised as the woman's husband. The magical disguise was given to him by Merlin, under the condition that he be given Uther's first born son, who was Arthur.

In the original story, Nimue was a young woman that Merlin fell in love with and taught to use magic. She in turn used this magic to cause him to fall asleep in a tomb, only to rise when England needed him most.

Morgana is Arthur's half sister, not a ward of Uther's. 

Mordred is Arthur's son by Morgana, and kills Arthur, who is then interred on the isle of Avalon. I don't recall if there is a legend that says he would also rise again, but I feel that there might be...

Anyways, those are a bunch of the differences. There are also differences with the knights of the round table, and Camelot in general, but I can't remember what most of them are. ",0,1406592608,null,0,false,0,cjaiujf,t3_2bw4fs,t1_cjaiujf,t1_cjadhwr,null,1434948131,3,false,merlinbbc,t5_2s3xe,3

the relevant bits:

&gt; Q. Lovren is obviously a target for Liverpool, have you heard anything regarding a second bid for the player? And if he does sign is he likely to partner Sakho or be an alternative to Sakho. 

&gt; A. Think they'd like to bring two centre backs in. Lovren will almost certainly come. Think they'd like Lovren, Sakho and another

&gt; Q. With plenty of players likely to leave, with Assaidi, Borini both set to join Suarez through the exit door, would you expect the likes of Toure, Agger, Lucas to leave.

&gt; A. Not Toure. He's got another year on the contract. Lucas definitely, Agger if they get centre backs in

It's one step forward, two back. You want players to excel for your side, and you want players to step up and build around them - but as soon as you get in that position, ''poof'' - they're gone. Then you can't ever attract the players you need to compete on top of that. The better you do, the worse off you are in the long run right now. Which is sad. 

Happened to Dortmund, their Gegenpressing high tempo style torn apart with Gotze, Lewa, Kagawa gone and the parasites swooping around Reus &amp; Hummels. Atletico and their grit beating the status quo - torn apart (happy Griezmann went though, and they've strengthened), Southampton, cracking football, great young core - ONE good season, torn apart. Juve storming the league, excellent 3-5-2, 4-3-3 setup with Vidal &amp; Pogba? Yeah, every other thread is about one of them leaving.

Where does it end? Until we have an ELITE CL GOLDEN SUPERSTA LEAGUE with the half dozen big sides? You just cannot compete anymore, other clubs are no more than teams for them to play against and I'm getting so jaded with football. Sadly, most fans are bandwagoners and don't understand it. They know they're pretty much guaranteed success in some shape or form, but for the other 99% of fans it's just not the same. 

Lamela has a cracking season? How much you wanna bet that xxx is interested in Lamela, and xxx will chime in on /r/soccer about how ''Lamela should leave, etc etc''. The same teams and fans who branded him as a flop. Lloris signs a deal? Just for the high transfer fee when he leaves, right? He should leave, etc. Same with Jan. Eriksen will be next. It's a joke. 

And the saddest part is these top quality players end up juggled around the elite teams like they're nothing. Ruin their careers? Fuck it. James Rodriguez had a good WC, 80m on him. Ship Di Maria off for 60m to some oil rich plastic team. Isco? Ah, he's soo last summer. Fifa need to sort it out - FFP just makes their grip even stronger.

1. Soccer isn't as big here, and it does have a lot of competition, but I think there is plenty of room for growth. The game as a whole seemed like it started to 'tip' culturally during the world cup. Maybe that's only where I live, though -- as MLS fanbases go, Sporting KC's is pretty passionate, and they're gaining a lot of popularity in town, especially with Besler (who was born in KC) and Zusi on the team for what looks like the long term. And most of the fans I know who started rooting for Sporting because of local pride or social reasons gradually started looking to the European game, too. We Americans can't help but be attracted to the best of everything.

2. Personally, I chose Everton because they felt like the EPL equivalent of another sports team I follow closely -- the KC Royals. The colors are similar, their payroll is similar relative to the rest of their respective leagues, and both fanbases definitely seem to embrace the underdog vibe. So maybe it'd be cool if the club reached out and established a 'sister club' relationship with sports teams in the U.S.?

course i would love a draxler or something on the left but realistically, we have lamela and eriksen as well who have the potential to be proper world class attacking midfielders, so having a direct, home grown, hard working and pacey wide man in Jay who can also finish could prove to be a balanced front third imo. i mean, he is 24, so he isn't young, but he still hasn't hit his prime yet, so his best is also to come.",0,1406603204,null,0,false,0,cjanxdb,t3_2by9qi,t1_cjanxdb,t1_cja8hqs,null,1434950525,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

This is the beat thing for the club as it will raise it's profile with fans in the states. 

Everton punches above its weight. It's the younger brother of the larger EPL teams with a refuse to lose attitude (now that we have Bobby Brown Shoes). I love the club cause of their history, and colors. For I was born a blue. 

The more NBC promotes the sport, the more attention all of the teams will receive. A rising tide lifts all boats. With more attention no doubt Tim will work his magic on the American market. They're be more AmEvertonians. Just wear your gear and support the club. 

Hopefully once the team can finance and build a new stadium this will help attract the right investor in the club; one that will build a team through its youth system, retaining the stars they develop, and making shrewd transfer signings to enhance a strong squad.

Were I to make a combined 11 based on their squad last season it would probably be Lloris; Walker, Lovren, Vertonghen, Shaw; Schneiderlin, &lt;take your pick of our CMs&gt;; Lamela, Eriksen, Rodriguez; Soldado/Adebayor 

Lambert is probably the only other name you could throw into the mix, but if Adebayor had been given the chance to play a full season his numbers would have been better surely. They are similar players in that they are unselfish and clever on the pitch, but if Poch can motivate Ade he's simply a much more gifted footballer. Soldado based on pedigree is also a vastly superior player, but he needs to prove it in the Premier League still.


Of course it will all come down to whether or not our players are as receptive to the manager's ideas as Southampton's. Getting in a few of his former players would do wonders for that IMO.

These aren't mentioned in spin-offs. We never found out what the deal with the angels was, though. Moffat said he is probably done writing episodes about them.

2. Rose never was the TARDIS, but there was an episode in Series 6, ""The Doctor's Wife"", where the TARDIS took the form of a human.

3. Clara is not all of the companions. She exists as multiple people in the Doctor's timeline, all of whom have died. Most of the times the Doctor has met a ""fake"" Clara , it has not been in an actual episode. All of the other companions are separate people. 
And yes, many people have ""shipped"" the Doctor and companions, especially 10 and Rose.

4. The Doctor and Clara saw the Doctor's future, when he is burried, in ""The Name of the Doctor"". In ""The Time of the Doctor"",  the Time Lords prevent this from happening by granting the Doctor another set of regenerations. So all of the stuff with the Doctor's tomb never happened. The Doctor will not die on Trenzalore any time in the future.

5. River is a Time Lord and a companion. A companion is really anybody who travels with the Doctor, and there have been Time Lord companions before in the classic series (Susan Foreman and Romana). 

6. Hurt is an incarnation in-between the 8th and 9th Doctors. The thing he did was ending the Time War. It's not the future, it happened in that blank area between Classic Who and New Who.

7. I certainly feel sorry for the Time Lords. They had such high authority in Classic Who and now they're just sort of gone. It is highly speculated that they will come back in Series 8 or 9.

8. The Doctor's name has never been stated. The reason it's so important is because if he says his name the Time Lords will know it is really him.

9. I'm sure they have, with all the flirting between them and how many times they've been together off-screen.

10. The Daleks have always been a representation of pure evil and hatred. The Dalek in the episode ""Dalek"" had feelings because it was part human.

It's not exactly controversial to support Palestine, so god knows why you're acting like it is. But let's say, if Israel did completely remove themselves from the occupied territories, do you think that would end it all and peace would reign in the middle east? 

Yeah, me neither. 

Hamas and Hezbollah are still going to exist, and Iran and all the rest of them will still fight their little proxy wars against Israel. There are more than two actors in this conflict and nothing you or anyone else here does is going to make the slightest bit of difference to it. Whether you acknowledge it as nonsense or not, Israel does have a right to defend itself. Is it nonsense to suggest Palestinians have a right to defend themselves too? Of course it isn't. What a double standard. 

What do you propose Northern Irish people do about it, anyway? Gather in Lurgan town centre again? Yeah, I'm sure Netanyahu will be straight onto the UN declaring a complete cessation of violence. Like, fair enough - it's admirable to protest against the needless death of innocent Palestinians, but then what? Protestors have no power. The fact is, if you feel so strongly, go write to your MP instead of pontificating on here to people who have no say in global politics. It won't make any difference of course, but that's still your only real option, short of travelling out to Gaza yourself. Have you got a trip planned by any chance? Didn't think so.

Your efforts to try and shame people into action are nothing more than your own misplaced anger at your own inability to do anything about the situation. It's been done before, and much more eloquently.

&gt; I've even heard people say they were sick hearing about it. They were the same people that sat on the fence during apartheid SA. Hiistory won't be kind to these people.

""History not being kind to these people"" is such a meaningless statement it's not worth taking seriously. Some random apathetic twat in Moira isn't going to be judged by history too heavily because someone thousands of miles away died because someone else killed him. No, what you meant by ""history won't be kind"" is that they'll not be judged kindly by **you.** Yeah, well, no offense and all but who gives a shit which people you judge, or for what reasons. You're not any more of an arbiter of reason than anyone else, even though you present yourself as one. That is, at least not until you make some adult arguments that aren't wildly emotional, one-sided appeals to moral superiority, completely lacking in any degree of nuance. 

I look forward to hearing your concerns over North Korean concentration camps, Chechen state-sponsored torture and murder, corruption in Zimbabwe or any of the myriad other examples of man's inhumanity to man that are currently raging around the world. Where's your outrage over that? Does history judge those who are apathetic about other conflicts as badly as those who are apathetic to your particular bandwagon? 

Other people have been just as concerned about Gaza for just as long or longer than you, and your meek little call to arms has been seen a million times before. It's not surprising people have grown apathetic - after your third intifada seeing the same thing happening over and over again, you realise exactly how powerless the individual is. This is power politics, and we're not invited.

Feel free to discuss it all you want.

* Rose was never the Tardis.

* Clara is not all the companions. The Doctor called Clara the ""Impossible Girl"" because he had met two other versions of her and witnessed them both die, and he couldn't figure that out. This was caused, as you seem to already know, by her being splintered into different versions of herself when she jumped into the Doctor's time stream. Those versions of herself, unknown to themselves, counteracted the efforts of the Great Intelligence to destroy the Doctor. The Doctor doesn't seem to have any significant or memorable  interaction with those versions of Clara until the 11th Doctor.

* The whole ""companions falling in love with the Doctor"" trope is a relatively new thing and generally confined to New Who. Previous companions generally just hung out and had adventures without all of that relationship drama. 

* ""Time can be rewritten"", the theme of Moffatt's run. I didn't really get it when I watched the episode either, but I remember reading an article a while back where Moff explained that the ""original"" timeline was the one where they visited the graveyard had the 11th Doctor dying on Trenzalore. Clara's intervention to provoke the Time Lords into giving him a new set of regenerations rewrote it, creating a new timeline where he regenerated into the 12th. 

* Yes, but not a full time one. She's supposed to be a prisoner in a high security prison, but it's insinuated that the 11th Doctor often drops in and takes her for adventures. 

* Hurt was the incarnation between the 8th Doctor (McGann) and the 9th Doctor (Eccleston). He fought in the Time War, it's insinuated that he did a lot of potentially terrible un-Doctorish stuff during that period.
He says in *Name of the Doctor* that to him the name ""Doctor"" wasn't just a name, but a code of conduct. The 8th Doctor realized that he couldn't do anything about the Time War if he abided by those rules, so he abandoned them, which meant he abandoned the name ""Doctor"" for that regeneration. So yes, he is the 9th incarnation of that Time Lord, but he didn't consider that incarnation of himself ""The Doctor"". 

* Eh. For all we know, they could have turned into space Nazis. From the way the Doctor talks about it, the seemingly large contingent Rassilon led in *The End of Time*, and the way the pilot Cass reacts to the Doctor being one in *Night of the Doctor*, they seem to have been involved in some pretty terrible stuff.

* No, I didn't think that.

* His name's never been a huge deal until Moff decided to make it a huge deal. No one knows it. 

* Who knows. That whole ""relationship"", if you could call it that, is pretty one-sided, with River feverishly obsessing over the Doctor. He seems to like her alright, but it does seem it's mostly River.

* Hurt's Doctor was made up specifically for the 50th anniversary, so there's not really much out about him.

* I suppose an in-universe explanation could be there are many different kinds of Daleks, despite the fact that they pride themselves on their genetic superiority and homogenousness.

* You could always check out Classic DW. Fair warning, it's mostly a totally different beast from the new show. If you have a subscription to Netflix, it has a good sampling of the classic Doctors. If you subscribe to Hulu Plus or Amazon Prime they offer a much larger selection. I think iTunes has a bunch, but I believe they're pay per episode.

Lol, that's not why OG's happen. OG's happen because: 

1. A defender isn't tight to the player, allowing them space and time to get a shot off. The defender goes to block the shot, which is nice and all, but deflections are a lottery, with OG's one possible outcome

2. A defender is running towards their goal to intercept a cross, and their momentum causes them to direct the ball into their own goal. This happens because the CB was not in position quickly enough to adjust their body shape to clear the ball away from their goal.

Skrtel's not shit, but just like different attacking players flourish under different setups, different defensive players flourish under different setups. Andy Carroll would never reach his Newcastle heights for a Liverpool side that didn't know how to use him, Suarez exploded once Rodgers replaced Dalglish and built the attack around him, and the media were writing obituaries for John Terry's career under AVB's high defensive line. Skrtel was surprisingly excellent last season - at all of the things Skrtel is good at. He still had his traditional weaknesses (physical strikers, defending set pieces, and discomfort with a high defensive line) - weaknesses that will continue to be exposed under Rodgers' system.

I would love for nuclear to become our principal power source like the French, and for research into molten salt reactors that can burn up our existing waste stockpiles to become a reality. You're right - we can't continue on gas and oil, and the sooner we can phase them out the better.

But we can't phase them out *now* for wind/solar - which *do* generate noticeable amounts of electricity but we can't control *when*, so we still need gas to fill in the gaps when the wind ain't blowin' and the sun ain't shinin'.

Neither can we phase them out now for nuclear because we don't have it yet and it takes a long time to build.

So, regrettably, we do need this shale gas to fill the gap. And gas is good at that, because unlike coal/oil/nuclear stations, they can be brought online and offline relatively quickly, to fill in short-term shortfalls in renewables.

The worrying thing is, politicians being the self-serving short-termist fuckwads they are, they'll build the gas plants ostensibly as a ""stopgap"", and then not bother to invest in the nuclear/renewables for the longer term.

It would put the emphasis on universities to provide much better alumni programmes for former-students, with better access to things like ongoing careers advice and recruitment services. In in its simplest form, it would give your university a vested interest in your long term financial success... it's a very clever idea... in principle... but it seems to me though that it will fall down in the implementation. 

The danger with all the proposals so far is that in my opinion, the university sector just will brush off the dangers of being over exposed to long term debt as either **a)** *""someone else's problem in 15 years""* or **b)** *""we're too important to fail, so the government will bail us out if we fail to recover debts""*. What will then happen is the £9000 cap on fees will be removed (which is the read-between-the-lines message) and the upward march of costs will surge ahead, to the detriment of the sector in the long term.

There are also big unanswered questions like how foreign student debt would be managed. This might seem minor, but it really isn't. Some universities like say Nottingham recruit heavily within the UK and would probably as a Russel Grouper known for good graduate employment figures not struggle to recoup its finances... now take somewhere like the London School of Economics.

It doesn't seem as if this huge clearout of players was absolutely required, though. I think it's just a sort of dominoe effect of losing so many key personnel. Certainly given they've received about £100m in transfer fees so far, with more likely, it would appear the financials are in OK shape, biut now the team's in bits.

Koeman has a large task ahead of him, but will be given money. It's not like they ahven't always sold their top players (Walcott, Shearer, Oxlade-Chamberlain), but never so many at once.

As for Cortese, he was renowned for being ruthless, abrasive and very driven to take Southampton from League One into the Premiership, and he did that and did so quickly, and without too much concern for leaving a few casualties in his wake. Like two previous managers.

But the problem is for a club like Southampton, what next? Is there really any chance for them to do better than 8th? What was next? A CL place? I don't think that would be a consistent, realistic goal. They're not a big club historically, geographically or from a fanbase POV. They aren't in London. Or a footballing stronghold like the NW.

Yes, they've got the biggest stadium in the South of England outside London, but that's still 30,000 for home games, and it drops by about 5,000 every time they drop a division. And it can't really go up, because they don't sell out the ground every week even playing in the Premiership.

&gt;Rose: wasn't she at some point *the Tardis*? Not her as ""Rose"" in that one finale where she was the Bad Wolf, but an earlier episode I think??? (Like how Clara was a Dalek, and then wasn't, but I think that's because she jumped in the time lighties in Name of the Doctor and got scattered?).

No, never. She had the time vortex infused into her, which was what made her Bad Wolf.

&gt;* Is Clara is ALL the companions? Is that what the Impossible Girl means? If so, is it a paradox when the companions show up together? (Amy's hologram plus Clara in *this* episode, for example?) —oh, and did fans ever ""ship"" Doctors+companions? Just from this end, watching backwards as I did (S7, S6, S3, S1, S4-6 again, just caught the remainder of S2 and a few I'd missed from other seasons; and now a rewatch in order **minus special episodes** I still haven't seen!) I thought the companions seemed to get crushes on the doctors, then fell in love with someone else, then the Doctor seemed ""jealous"" but not really — afraid of being alone, maybe? I don't GET it!

No she wasn't. Multiple versions of her appeared throughout time; this was what made her impossible.

&gt;Okay so I''ve been watching for six months **total**, and only a few webisodes, so bear with me:

&gt;* Matt S/11 is the *first* doctor ***buried***, right, and buried here (finale s7) on ""Christmas""/Tranzadore? **—But he's not buried on Tranzadore** because he got a new 12, so what was all that Tranzadore stuff in the earlier episode (with River/Clara.. one of the last three episodes!!) Is it a future thing and River is coming *back*? (I had assumed she would, but that pope lady, Tasha?, just said they designed River to kill the Doctor, *and I got the impression she's done* :O You can **spoiler** the answer if it's known, I don't care about spoilers obviously (well I'm not LOOKING for them, but this one question, I'd love to know!!!) ....or if there's a theory, just say it. Thanks.

...eh? Matt's the Eleventh Doctor and he was buried in *Trenzalore*, but the Time Lords changed the timeline and gave him a new regeneration cycle.

&gt;* **Is River a companion at all?** Or half-Time Lord, half-companion?

Occasional companion, but she's not half-Time Lord, she's Human+. Human with a bit of Time Lord thrown in.

&gt;* 11/MattS explains the counting of the doctors well enough for me; thinks this is his final, etc. *And he aged,* obviously, which would surely lead one to believe, ""Yep: end of the line!"" But what I didn't get was, **What did John Hurt do?** Is that still future?

The Doctor can still age even if he's not on his last body. Look at the First Doctor, for instance. The War Doctor was between the Eighth and Ninth Doctors (we even saw both sides of the regeneration). What he did is long past, before series 1.

&gt;I read a theory here saying he wasn't ""The Doctor"" since he took on The War Doctor moniker, but the cool episode he was IN actually SAID ""**John Hurt as The Doctor**"" so why doesn't he *count*? (But then again, Matt S/11 knows his secret *and seemed to count him* so maybe something the War Doctor did was erased?) Are there generally accepted theories on that? (Btw, I read [Moffat's explanation](http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-11-15/doctor-who-steven-moffat-clears-up-confusion-around-the-number-of-john-hurts-doctor) and don't buy it. Not for a moment. Makes no sense.

He was the same Time Lord, but he chose to not go by the name ""Doctor"" because of what he was born to do.

&gt;* **Anyone else feel a little sorry for the Time Lords?** I sorta hope they get out of the crack; not understanding why that's a bad thing unless you're pro-Dalek (*though indeed the Daleks are my favorite ""bad guys"").*

Technically they're not even in the crack, but yes, hopefully they'll eventually get out.

&gt;* Real-time viewers here who commented on last episode (TotD): when the Christmas people asked Clara and 11's real name and 11 said ""**I'm wearing a wig""**, did anyone else think, ""Ah, his name is 'I'm wearing a wig'??"" LOL, seriously, *I'm all over that!* I want someone to walk up to that crackie thing and say it!

I never thought that because it was obvious that he wasn't answering that question.

&gt;* No okay really, *what is his name?* Why is it a big deal?

We'll never know.

&gt;*Have River and the Doctor ever *hooked up*? If so... *when*? No, no: *why?* I see chemistry there, and they're cute and all, but if they know what they know... **is she planning on outsmarting** (or did she already outsmart) **whoever kidnapped her?**

They're married and he took her on dates during her nights in Stormcage. What do you think?

&gt;I want a sonic screwdriver!

If you think vices are the reason we hate politicians then you are so far from reality I don't know what to suggest.

People hate politicians after half a century of triangulation has left the same people on political contested ground deciding the election while routinely disenfranchising the majority. Whereas before politicians made compromises to win middle ground voters, now they make compromises to the people who theoretically they represent most.

This has led to politics that is generic and unrepresentative.

I don't know any way to fix this other than changing the voting system so that it is easier to punish big tent parties when they wander so far into the middle ground that their baseline supporters can't even see them in the political fog. There is no way to fix it while the system is as it is. There'll always be the ""less evil"" imperative sustaining the current lot.

It is nothing to do with politicians making mistakes or sleeping with the wrong people. Blair was routinely assumed to be lying about his personal life but managed to return election after election.

Keepers: Hart or Willy vs Cech and Courtois = CHELSEA

Right backs: Zabaleta or Sagna vs Azpi or Ivanovic = DRAW 

Centre backs: Kompany, Nastasic, probably Mangala and Demichelis vs JT, Cahill, Ivanovic and Zouma = I think that we have the better first choice partnership but City have the better depth. Also, notice that we're re-using Ivanovic here whereas City have four out and out centre backs.

Left backs: Clichy or Kolarov vs Luis or Azpi = CITY. Re-using Cesar and Clichy and Kolarov are proven. It's tight though.

Centre midfield: Toure, Fernando, Fernandinho, Garcia (I'm sure I'm missing someone?) vs Fabregas, Matic, Ramires, van Ginkel, Mikel etc = DRAW. Mainly because Yaya is better than all of our options but I think we have better depth. It's close.

Attacking midfield/wing: Nasri, Silva, Navas, Milner, Sinclair (lol), again I think I'm forgetting someone vs Hazard, Willian, Oscar, Schurrle, Salah = ANOTHER DRAW for me. Nasri regularly produces, Silva is brilliant and Navas is very direct. Milner is hugely underrated too. 

For us, Hazard is brilliant, Oscar underwhelmed massively in the last half of last season and Willian and Schurrle have been good in spurts.

Strikers: Aguero, Negredo, Dzeko, Jovetic vs Costa, Lukaku, Drogba and Torres = CITY. Until we see how Costa turns out, there's no real argument on this one.

Overall it's tight between us and City. I'd give the edge to City because their squad is more experienced.",0,1406624168,null,0,false,0,cjaujj0,t3_2c0zqu,t1_cjaujj0,t3_2c0zqu,null,1434953714,42,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,42

I think a big factor in this is that she wants to reduce the wage bill as much as possible while she is looking for a buyer. The transfers are probably a way for her to cover the running costs of a club that she doesn't want to bankroll.

My only hope is that she has been convinced to do enough to keep this team in the premier league. Perhaps the policy is to sell the team that finished 8th and replace it with a team capable of finishing 16th-17th.

That would explain the appointment of a decent manager and the signing of some players with potential to be good enough for the premier league.

true,teaandtoasttime,null,null,"I probably go a bit overboard with stuff I take but here's some bits you might find useful

- Snacks - when you wake up starving in the morning and cba to trudge through the wasteland to a food van. Also great if you're in a big crowd and can't get to a place for food or don't want to miss the next act. Cereal bars, some fruit like apples that can take a bit of a beating and still be edible (wrap in a food bag inside your normal bag in case it gets a bit squished). I also took the little pots of fruit in juice and had those for breakfast at camp, so refreshing when you're thirsty.

- Binbags - Great for keeping anything wet/muddy/sweaty things separate from your clean stuff. Also great for sitting on. Great trick I learnt and was thankful for in the long drop ""toilets"" at Leeds - Get a bin bag and open it up, with part of the bag down the loo. You then sit on the inside bit, do your business and simply let the bag fall down the loo. 

- Long socks - If you're wearing wellies all weekend, they can rub very painfully against bare legs so always make sure your socks are high enough to cover above the top of the wellies to prevent the friction burns. 

- Baby wipes - Take a least two packets so you can keep one for your face/body and one for cleaning stuff when it gets covered in mud or dust.

- Eye drops - A godsend if you're wearing contact lenses all weekend and not getting much sleep and dehydrated. Also good if it's very dusty to make you feel a bit more alive. I have the Boots own brand for dry and tired eyes (about £2) and I can put them in when wearing contact lenses.

- Warm jumper/hoody - It can get freezing at night when you're trying to sleep so always take something a bit thicker.

- Scarf - Not a wooly type scarf but a big, thin one that are usually about £3/4 in Primark. I had this in my bag all the time. Used it for covering my shoulders/neck when stood in full sun to stop burning, also keeps you a lot warmer than expected if bundled up round your neck when stood in the crowd at night. I also used it to cover my face when walking back to the campsite at T in the Park as it was ridiculously dusty and hard to breathe at points when everyone was stamping through it all together. 

- Old phone - Dig out an older phone to take with you, like a brick Nokia that will easily last a few days without charging. You won't have to worry about your smartphone getting nicked/broken in the crowd.

- Clothes - Think v carefully about what you're going to wear. Magazines and shops love to push ""festival fashion"" but long tassely kimonos, playsuits and gladiator sandals are grim to say the least in a portaloo.

After she refused to do so the group declared 'war' on Nokes, and despite Nokes' appeals to the group to help her deliver it, accused her of betraying her commitment to their agenda, and began a campaign against her. The group organised a demonstration in Nokes constituency, for which they were criticised by local residents, encouraged their members to visit Nokes' family home at night, posted late-night Tweets saying they were driving around her village 'looking for' her, asked members to send the MP their dirty underwear, demanded to see a Court Order outlining her daughter's living and contact arrangements, and falsely alleged her ex-husband was having difficulty having contact with his daughter

And then they had their Twitter accounts suspended for harrassment.

Well, considering that the lib dems share of the popular vote went up, but the number of MPs they got went down, it's politics I struggle to believe in.

But for Nick Clegg, the lib dems had 57 MPs to the conservatives 305 MPs, but actually have acted closer to an equal partner in deciding policy, with lots of Conservative backbenchers claiming Cameron etc. had victory in hand and squandered it. The price of this influence for the lib dems though has been annihilation of their main policies - politically destroying them as an alternative force in UK politics.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"Draxler. I say Draxler for a few reasons. He's only 20, has played over 100 Bundesliga games and had that WC experience (albeit behind the scenes). He's tall, he's not some 5'5 import so I think he'll adjust quickly (yes, strength doesn't = height, I know) but he's strong. He's also (from what I hear) a bit annoyed that Meyer has pushed him out of his role and he would fit in Poch's system so well AMR, AML, AMC - and he is VERY two footed. Holtby made the move as their number 10, so I don't think it's *too* unfathomable. He wanted to stay at Schalke for noble reasons last year. *""I will do the same this summer. I want to play one year more in Schalke.""*. Now Arsenal have Sanchez. He's already up in my book for declining that move. 

He's a fantastic dribbler, has an eye for a pass, has an insane long shot on him, has an aerial presence (due to his height additionally) and is a great crosser and comfortable holding up the ball - which helps being so ambidextrous with his feet. And he's great on the counter attack. 

And many German pundits, Bayern fans, BVB Fans (despite the rivalry) and followers of the National Team think he's the next big thing in Germany. If he's at all avalible on any level like Lamela was, we should take the plunge. I genuinely thought we had less chance of Lamela than we would Draxler right now. And we play them soon, so Levy might work some magic. 

Unlikely, but Lamela unlikely. Not Messi, Benatia, Vidal unlikely.

true,baddada77,lfc68,,"Skrtel did have a good season last year but is not set in stone as the ideal partner for Lovren yet. I still think Sakho is the better long-term bet.

Skrtel impressed last year with the multitude of blocks, last ditch tackles, chance saving interceptions, etc. I commend him on those but the reasons he had so many were his positioning errors and the fact he backs off and backs off to let an opponent shoot. 

A top CB is a player you barely notice on the pitch because he's quietly positioned perfectly, rarely gives his man a sniff of goal and always seems to be first to the ball because he reads the game so well. Skrtel is a reactive CB. Guys like Kompany, Silva or even our own Hansen are/were proactive CB's that get the job done effortlessly.

true,insoundfromwayout,null,null,"As a counter argument to this -

Websites that run advertising are usually run at least as *some kind* of business - if not outright to make profit, at least enough to try and cover time and server costs. And the adverts the police are putting up in this case are for the sole intention of driving away users/consumers of this business by informing them that the owner or the enterprise as a whole has been reported to the police for perhaps breaking the law, and outright asking them to close the page and stop what they are doing.

A real world example might be, say a man owns a highstreet shop, and is accused of a crime. Someone might stand outside of his shop on the highstreet giving out ads to passers by and people attempting to enter telling them ""I just wanted you to know the owner of this shop has been accused of a serious crime. Please shop somewhere else""

Now, you're right, thats probably not a violation of the maxim ""Innocent until proven guilty"" - all that is being said is the truth: this man has been reported to the police for a crime, and then the personal opinion that you would be better to shop somewhere else. And it's *probably* legal to do. But you can see it would be very disruptive and perhaps destructive, and that there is of course a chance that the owner is entirely innocent - anyone can 'accuse' anyone of anything -in which case the behaviour hardly seems *fair*.

So what if it were the police themselves conducting this campaign? What if it wasn't just a member of the public standing outside, but a couple of uniformed officers, handing out these flyers saying ""I just wanted you to know the owner of this shop has been accused of a serious crime. Please shop somewhere else"" because he had been reported to them as perhaps having committed a crime. And if once it gets to court he can prove that he didn't commit a crime, they stop.

You're right that this doesn't strictly infringe on the idea of 'innocent until proven guilty' - one could take the opinion that all the police are doing in a legal sense is 'educating' the public and 'making their presence known', and perhaps at worst it could be penned down as 'harassment', as you say. But other people, like I assume the OP you were replying to, might feel that that sort of behaviour, especially from the police, infringes on the *spirit* of the maxim 'innocent until proven guilty', by intentionally driving away business from a man accused of a crime before he has had a chance to formally defend himself.

I mean, I'm not telling you your opinion: if you think that kind of thing is ok, if the idea of police disrupting business online at the accusation of lawbreaking sits well with you, then that's your opinion, I can't tell you you're wrong. But I don't think it takes much to imagine why other people might not agree with you.

Rafa reinvigorated our academy and brought in a young Spanish starlet who became the face of the new academy - a symbol of the new production line and all it's promise. Sterling was bought at a similar time but, being English, he was less exotic and flew under the radar a bit more.

Since he signed many have been waiting for him to make the first team. The symbolic nature of his signing grew out of proportion and his success became intertwined with the perceived success of our academy. He simply *had* to make it.

We now know this is not the case. We have a list as long as your arm of potential first team players coming through, but Suso was the first - the darling. He will always be more than just another player. He carried our hopes and dreams of a brighter future when our present was at it's darkest.

You can't expect any fan from that era (5 to 10 years) to be objective about Suso. He was a cult hero before he pulled on a first team shirt.",0,1406629267,null,0,false,0,cjavgu9,t3_2c1082,t1_cjavgu9,t3_2c1082,null,1434954160,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

I think the comparison is justified 

Which in a lot of instances is what's happening with fraud investigations. Large corps put pressure on the Police to enforce the law so they can minimise losses. In fact, there's a fraud department in CoL *funded* by insurance companies. You could perhaps stretch the comparison to also include the prosecution of uninsured drivers. 

Things are expensive. Twas ever thus. Thieves probably make the same argument. Why pay full price when you can get it from Dodgy Dave?

Probably.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;What basis do people have for claiming Hamas is using innocent people in Gaza to shield weapons? 

Only last week the U.N. found that Hamas were using a school as an arms cache....there's plenty of stuff you can google on this, but [Here you go](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/gaza-hamas-fighters-military-bases-guerrilla-war-civilians-israel-idf).

&gt;That because they didn't leave their homes and schools, due to Hamas coercion or otherwise, then Israel is justified in blowing them up?

As far as Israel is concerned, if they can detect arms caches, etc. that are being used to attack them, they will retaliate - after that, it's up to Palestinians to take heed of the advanced warnings they provide (Hamas, by comparison, don't give any warnings).

&gt;There are now over 1000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel started its military operation in Gaza. Including many children.

Indeed - many of which could have been spared if Hamas had simply stopped firing rockets, as  Israel would then have had no justification to retaliate.

&gt;No context justifies this.

Correct, but that applies to both sides - if you're going to provoke a neighbour who has ten times your firepower, it might not be best to place your HQ and operations around schools, hospitals and other civilian centres - what justification is there for firing rockets *at random targets* on a daily basis?

It's not though. The fraud action teams within CoL and the wider police services are actively investigating, charging and aiding in the prosecutions and convictions of offenders. These are specific criminal offences.

In this case, the CoL are simply trying to lock down and suffocate sites without any clear, identifiable indication of guilt. Most of these sites are simply sharing links to torrent files - no 'illegal' content or ripped-off works will ever 'set foot' on their servers. Google has links to millions of torrent files within it's Search Index - but you don't see the CoL trying to stick PPC ads up warning people there.

If they want to do what'd actually within their remit, they should track down and prosecute the people who rip these works off and share them via torrents. They know this is incredibly difficult with the security and privacy these individuals place around themselves, so instead of just going for it, they're going for the easy option of lopping off the head of the distribution network which hasn't really done anything wrong in legal terms.

This is something I never liked about Jonathan Ross ; he talked too much (phrasing the question in multiple ways and interrupting the guests).

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"In the timeframe of the last 12 months (year on year growth).

In the timeframe of the last quarter (quarter on quarter growth) we are behind (in Europe only because the list is too long otherwise):

* Macedonia
* Ireland
* Turkey
* Bosnia and Herzegovina
* Poland
* Hungary
* Moldova
* Malta
* Denmark
* Germany 

Comparing to Germany who are the most apt comparison, we have higher inflation, higher unemployment, more government debt and a worse balance of trade.

In the timeframe of the last 6 years to get back to pre-crisis levels of output (which is what the article is about) we're amongst the slowest in the G20, and GDP per capita has still not recovered. This is longer than the recovery took from the great depression. For contrast, the great depression took 4 years to return to pre-crisis peak, a typical recession post-war (dotcom boom, etc.) has taken at most 3 years to return to full output. Six years is ridiculous no?

So to extend my analogy, it's like saying we didn't even qualify for Euros in 2012 but everyone else we're comparing to did, now that we got to the group stage in the world cup we're most improved.

It's not a bad thing that we're growing now, but the point is that we haven't had the 'success' we would have expected - surely we would have returned to pre-crisis levels sooner than everyone else if we had the best economic policy?

Hence in my analogy how I said we were in the hardest group, because the argument is that the UK had the most difficult challenge to return to the pre-crisis peak.

So therefore it doesn't matter that we missed our own targets and goalposts, because 'well, we could have done worse'.",0,1406632522,null,0,false,0,cjaw4bs,t3_2by3he,t1_cjaw4bs,t1_cjavl4u,null,1434954461,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,gary1994,rory,Rory,"&gt;It's one thing for a show to deal with romantic relationships in a mature way.  
&gt;that's reasonable in real life, it makes for a truly frustrating, repetitive narrative.

That's kind of a contradiction isn't it?  So you are conceding that the show is portraying relationships in a realistic manner, but you just don't like it?  Implying that the show isn't dealing with them in a mature way is a nice nonspecific way to criticize without actually articulating anything concrete (and to avoid giving me anything to debate you on).

Personally I don't think it's been repetitive at all.  Each relationship has been very nuanced and well portrayed and, in my opinion, adds greatly to the show.  Some people *choose* not to (or don't seem to be *able* to) see the nuance and variation.  But it most definitely is there, so that's on them, not the writers.


&gt;It is entirely another for almost every single companion to have some form of romantic attraction to this one person.

This is actually what life is like for the more attractive people of the world.  People are drawn to them.  The root of attractive is attract after all.

&gt;Even if that's reasonable in real life, it makes for a truly frustrating, repetitive narrative.

How so?  Can you give some examples?  Personally, I want my characters and narrative (well, the human interaction bits) as realistic as possible.  It's why I watch the show.  If they ever move away from it I will stop because I think that making the characters less realistic would also make them much less relatable.

true,stevemegson,null,null,"You now have to go through ACAS's Early Conciliation process before making a claim and it's not clear whether claims that are settled in that way now count in these statistics. The statistics do list some claims being resolved by ACAS conciliated settlements, but the number is down by 91%. It's possible that the publicity about fees for employment tribunals has caused a huge drop in the number of people who even get as far as the free conciliation process, but it seems more likely that this number represents people who initially refuse early conciliation then later accept a settlement after starting their tribunal claim. We might worry that people feel more pressure to accept early conciliation when they have to pay a fee to continue the claim, and so people might get worse outcomes than they would before.

Looking at Jan-Mar 2013, less than 16% of claims reached a hearing and 61% of those were successful. This sounds good for the hypothesis that we've just got rid of the frivolous cases, but in Jan-Mar 2014 less than 10% of claims reached a hearing and 53% were successful. We might guess that the people who press on through conciliation to a hearing are now the stubborn people with dubious cases who won't take the hint when ACAS takes the employer's side, and so are less likely to succeed at a hearing. That's speculation, though.

There's also something going on with multiple claims skewing the overall figures, where airline employees have been resubmitting about 10,000 working time claims every few months for years.

e2: Also, get a Credit Card and pay it off every month if you haven't already. Your credit rating will be important. If you get a cashback deal it will also be a source of money from the money that you were going to spend anyway, which is really good for snowballing your cash. If you get interest from your current account it's an even better deal, as you're making sure your money is still earning interest.

He also needs to up his defending and pressing, even Hendo was shit under KK out wide and initially at CM. 2 years later and he looks great. Suso needs to combine his passing (does more long balls than through balls ) with defending and pressing to get into the team, nothing more or less. He can't run as much as Hendo but learning tackling and pressing comes from trying, when he was coming up through academy he might have been the most talented and could sit back while others recovered the ball. But in this team too many players are better creators than he is and he needs to add graft to his game. Luckily for him if he manages that he will also get place in Spain squad given their lack of ""english"" midfielders.


In the future he will either become excellent CM for a top club (hopefully us) or manage to play star role in a small team that lets him create and not track back. Even Mata who is 10 times the player he is was moved on due to lack of defensive skills, I can't imagine such players would work in a system that didn't have 2 good holding midfielders or put out wide like Silva.

I'm looking at cars at the moment and what I'm planning on doing is letting my girlfriend get the insurance policy in her name and adding me as a 2nd driver, it only costs about £200 more for the year and it's cheaper than getting 2 separate insurance policies.

Edit: About the lesson price, it's good finding cheap lessons but people have told me that they are cheap for a reason and to not go for them and to pay a bit more for a good, reputable instructor. My lessons cost either £20 for a single lesson, £190 for 10 lessons or £360 for 20 lessons. Its a lot of money but he certainly knows what he's doing, I have friends who are on their 30th lesson and are at the same stage I'm at. I wouldn't call it rushing through, I went on the road in my first lesson instead of building up to it and I drive to different areas to practice different maneuvers so in one lesson I practice driving on roads and maneuvers whereas somebody else might only do one thing per lesson e.g. driving around on the roads or the instructor driving to 1 location and the student just practicing the maneuver. An example is when I did 3 point turns, it was my 3rd or 4th lesson and he drove to the first location, I practiced them, I then drove to the 2nd location, practiced them some more, then drove to the 3rd, practiced some more and then drove to the 4th location and practiced some more, it was good because it let me practice 3 point turns but I also learned more about actual driving.

true,tomtomgg,null,null,"I didn't go to uni here so cant help on that front. However, I do cycle everywhere in Bristol and have done for the past 4 years.

Bristol is a relatively compact place and so it never really takes long to get around. There are a couple of steep hills about but they're mostly pretty short affairs or with a bit of route planning you can avoid them. During peak times its considerably quicker, plus you're not having to rely on a bus which may never actually turn up. One thing I would suggest is FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE ROAD. Jumping red lights, riding on pavements and running pedestrian crossings will not endear you to the driver following you. If they see you being a responsible road user they're much more likely to treat you with a bit of respect and give you plenty of space.

People will moan and whinge about how dangerous it is to cycle in Bristol and how drivers make it so dangerous, but lets be honest, it's no worse than cycling in any other city in the UK. You just have to know when to ride aggressively and when to ride defensively. 

As for bike security many people will go on about how dangerous it is to leave your bike locked up here. Again, I would suggest that there's nothing special to Bristol and it's just part of living in a city: Stuff gets nicked. Many people here have a good bike (one they look after and don't really leave locked up in public) and a town bike. The town bike will be a cheap bike used to transport from A to B and can be left locked up without worrying about it. I would suggest you go down this route when you arrive. If it does get nicked then its not the end of the world.

I own a car, but only use it for travelling the country for work. When in Bristol it's cycling all the way. You'll love it.

true,Matt-SW,null,null,"&gt; If a site is providing a link to pirated material then why shouldn't the Police do something about it (even if it is just putting an ad on the site)?

Because it's *not* a criminal matter, it's civil, yet our police forces and their time are being used to undertake this. Additionally, these ads are targeting people who very well could be using torrent sites for completely legitimate and legal purposes. Huge droves of torrent files available are for content that is completely legal and open to share. 

As I said before, they're trying to close down and stifle available of sites that aren't doing anything illegal. They're operating as torrent search engines, not ""FREE ILLEGAL CONTENT"" sites. If a couple of people are using a road to transport drugs, do you warm everyone away and try to close the road, or just target the people actually doing the crime?

&gt; The ""we're only a search engine"" argument has been made before and failed.

Because the legal systems in a majority of countries have already demonstrated very clearly that their understanding of technology is weak at best. 

&gt; The adverts aren't targeted at the sites per se, they're targeted at the people who would clink on the link and downloaded the content. Which is illegal.

I'll refer back to my point that the site's aren't illegal, and neither are the TORRENT FILES (not the content). You're doing what everyone does, and mistaking torrent files as actual files containing ripped movies and music. They're not. 

Torrent Search Engines index torrent files. Torrent files 'link up' people who all want to share a file. There will be one original *seed* who has the original file, and will send that file, piece by piece, over a torrent client to other people who are connected, using the torrent file.

At no point did the search engine (website) or the torrent file contain the copyrighted material.

If you look at polls on the EU, with an unnegotiated treaty (across the board a negotiated treaty has over 50% of people voting to stay in), something like 40%-45% vote to stay in, whereas 35%-40% vote to leave. However, over 2/3 of people support nationalising energy companies, Royal Mail and train companies, including over 50% of Tory voters, and around 75% of UKIP voters.

There were cases when both parents could be on fall time work when someone on benefits still had a higher income, that could be unemployment + Housing + Child plus other discretionary benefits, I can't see how that is justified. 

Not all welfare payments, including pensions should be universal. It has to be base on net worth rather than just existing.

You might well argue that fees aren't the solution to this, and that introducing the early conciliation process without introducing fees would have had much the same effect of encouraging conciliation and reducing the number of claims which are started but never reach a hearing.

Whatever the case, I think most football fans appreciated that Sturridge was great last season, and scored some quite wonderful goals; volleys, chips, tap-ins, headers. Some created with speed, others power and technique, others from reading the pass. All sorts of finishing on display.

You're in Fishponds, that's right by me and I go there most days! :D
The bars there are nice and cool, especially in the day just to chill out in beer gardens or in the bar/cafes around there, definitely the nicest of all of these little bouroughs in 'the sticks' (Staple Hill/Downend/Kingswood etc) for day to day chilling.

Plus Frenchay campus is very easy to get to, the Wessex Red buses run like every 8 minutes or something, they're usually quite unreliable but I've never had a problem in the last 4 years here (moved up for Uni too!)

For cycling to campus, I would recommend it, from Fishponds Road (for a point of reference) you can go down one long straight road (Manor Road) until you get to Blackberry Hill which is a really long winding Hill, so much fun to go down on a bike, from then on you can go straight through Stoke Park which is a smooth, flat path for cycling through a beautiful big field, through one posh estate after the park and you're at Frenchay Campus! The whole cycle will be like 25 - 30 minutes and it's a really nice smooth ride, I used to do it when I had exams at Frenchay :)

Which is rare for me these days now haha, but in Freshers however there will be so much more cheaper things.

I would say Fishponds isn't the safest, it's not bad there but I wouldn't leave your bike locked up outside for a few hours unless you're aware people will probably try and give it a go at trying to steal. A neighbour of mine had his bicycle stolen the day he moved in, took it from his car and put it in his garden shed while he was moving stuff in and around and forgot to actually lock the door, by the time the evening came it was gone haha.

I went with Natwest, interest free student account up to £2,000 overdraft allowed (maxed mine out, I advise you don't do that, takes ages to pay back if you're like me) and after you graduate you get 1 year to bring it down to £1,000 interest free and then another year on top of that to bring it to £0. Best deal I could find at the time. I believe they may offer a student rail card for free when you open one with them too, might have stopped doing that now though, not sure (the rail cards are worth £90 themselves)

I wouldn't score in Fishponds unless you want a bit of Basil or some shit cut with it. I personally don't do that anymore but from folks I know, they get it when they go out in the centre and they just found a hookup outside a club night, but yeah Fishponds is too scummy and there's fuck all in what you'd get from it here.

Hope this all helps, if you're up for meeting for a drink once you're settled in at The Old Postie near you or somewhere give me a shout!

&gt; You would rather people like whistleblowers, or people the bosses take a random dislike to, can get sacked on a whim and have no means to defend themselves, just so you can save a bit of money?

You're only presenting one side.  The con is not the money, the con is all the frivolous cases that cost an awful of money and probably jobs in small businesses.  It's easy to forget that more than 90% of employment is from small businesses.  Bad behaviour is not isolated to one side of this relationship.

I have regularly seen employees abusing the rights they have for financial gain.  I have irregularly seen employers abusing employees.  I am not so self-obsessed to think my observations equal the truth of the entire situation; but I'm not quite ready to say that the world is only full of evil employers abusing their employees and that there is no cost whatsoever associated with small businesses being dragged into costly lawsuits and settlements unfairly.

I'm saying I don't know what the balance of pros and cons are, you're saying you do know, and that it is by far the employers who are more abusive than the employees.

If you're in University of bristol, everyone bikes/walks everywhere anyway, it's small enough to do so pretty easily. Since you're in UWE, I'm not as sure what you'd do since that campus is further away from the city. I guess you'd have to get a bus in and a taxi out or something? Perhaps someone with UWE experience can elaborate a bit better than me

1) You'll no doubt miss out on potential flatmate friends in halls, but you can make new friends on your course and in societies. I wouldn't worry too much. It's easy to make flatmate friends since you'll always be with them, but you'll make friends in other places anyway

2) Ha, it's not just relatively cheap compared to london, it's like dirt cheap if you do it right. We lived in city centre, not sure if you're accomodation is in the city or near the UWE campus. I hear UWE students go for both. Since we lived in city centre, we spent no money getting around since we just walked to all the clubs.You'll probably need drinks, so you can kind of get it as cheap as you want. I used to go to a little corner shop 10 seconds away from the student union building, and spend about £5 for 2 bottles of wine (mind you, it didn't taste great). You could also go to sainsburys and look for deals on cheap vodka/other spirits and just buy a mixer etc. Once you get to the clubs, sometimes you can get good deals on these too. Places like Thekla or syndicate will typically have a guestlist before a certain time so you can get in really cheap, if not, you'd probably pay something like £4/5 to get in. I typically don't buy drinks at the bar, but bar prices are no where near as bad as london. I've gone on nights out for something like a tenner before and still had a good time (quite a few times), but if I go to multiple bars and get fast food+taxi to far place(which I hardly ever do) you can look for £20/30(+?). It's pretty easy to estimate how much you'd pay for a typical night once you do it a few times.

3)I live in Manchester ATM, and have also been to nights out in London, and can honestly say it's probably the city I'm most comfortable in the UK. I've hardly heard of any crime unlike lon &amp; man, and there's a lot of main roads you can stick to if you want. I'd insure the stuff in my room like laptop/computer, and maybe if you're worried buy a cheap burner phone (throwaway)which you're not worried about loosing/ getting stolen. Having said that, I take my smartphone out with me all the time, and feel pretty safe doing so.

4)Sorry, don't know which is the best bank. All of them ""share"" ATMs though, so you just get a debit card and take it out with you, go to any ATM (preferably with free withdrawals, most have them and they're all over the place) and just take out however much money you need. Never really thought about it I guess, but it's super convenient, sure.

5)You'll probably meet a friend or two that ""smokes"", no doubt, and just ask them for a number or something, I guess. If you're chummy they'd probably give you one. If you have trouble finding someone, you can try and find a good friends that smokes cigarettes and ask them too. A lot of people don't really judge much for doing it at uni. In terms of safe buying from a dealer? not sure, but I wouldn't worry about buying, just getting caught myself. Find a nice place to go (hill near clifton suspension bridge is pretty good, or so I hear especially at night), maybe a park or something without too many people nearby. UK's policy on weed is a bit more relaxed compared to some places. As long as it's not a really large amount, first time is likely to be just a warning.

Just sending out letters denying them the benefit will probably cost more than it saves. I mean you need a standardised letter that has been checked over by legal so that there is nothing in there that can be used against the DWP. Then you need to actually pass policies to implement this.

Stuff you'll want?  Gloves, glasses (getting stuff in your eyes sucks), everything you need to repair a puncture.

If you want to cycle that distance to work, get out on the weekend and cycle half or a quarter the distance and head home.  See how you feel.

Yeah, while you spend all their tax money on your rich friends and completely fuck over the people you're supposed to represent. I'd much rather have a Tory councillor than such an unabashedly corrupt one, because at least they have the decency to be honest when they're fucking us, and for the most part they get voted in legitimately. 

[The Telegraph's piece on him](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10993065/Industrial-scale-fraud-in-mayors-victory.html), if true, paints a picture of a horrendously dodgy election, with accusations ranging from intimidating gangs outside of polling stations to fake postal votes. Interestingly, the recount that he demanded sent the winner, Labour's Sanu Miah, from first to fifth in the polls. A recount in which the collected votes were held at a location owned by one of his supporters, and not a police station.

The faster this man's removed and the assets he stripped from the public returned, the better.

All this means that politicians in the US are incentivised to unleash massive demand stimulating policies when a recession hits, to try and create as much work as possible.

There are many things you can say that can be completely misinterpreted (just look at reddit), but that doesn't mean you can hang others based *only* on your own definition of a word.

I find it silly to assert that shortening the name of someone's country of origin could be offensive by default - in fact, it's actually insulting. Describing someone as 'black' can produce similar reactions if you ask enough people, but that doesn't make the word 'black' offensive even if others use it in a different context. And remember, Paki Shop is actually a mark of respect - they work bloody long hours, and are a lifesaver for many when it's 11pm and everywhere else that might sell aspirin is shut. Even when I was a kid in the 70's, it was obvious that the kind that wanted to 'send them home' didn't feel strongly enough to be prepared to take over *that* job and those hours.

If we ever reach the stage where you can use a word completely innocently but can be arrested because someone doesn't like the way someone *completely unconnected to you* uses it, then we really are in trouble - because then (for example) I could have you arrested for using the word 'book', because I find it offensive - what do you mean, you didn't know?

I rate him highly because from the last few interviews that he has done he seems to have a good attitude and he is ready and raring to go for the new season.

One other problem is that (and keep in mind I haven't seen him play THAT much, so I may be talking out of my ass) is that the physical nature of his game needs strengthening. Obviously we need quick players and although he'll never be as fast as Sterling he could work on becoming a better accelerator like Messi. From the world cup I saw that Messi doesn't sprint around the pitch all too often but when he gets the ball he goes from 0 to full speed very quickly. Suso could turn out to be a great speed dribbler if he takes a leaf out of Messi's book. Also he doesn't seem to bounce off players as well as Sterling who, for his size, is incredibly strong. He still has a lot of gis game to develop and although he shows signs of his potential (see. The goal against Preston) he is still way off from becoming a well honed tool.

That being said he is only 21 and shows a lot of promise for one so young. Technically I feel he is better than Sterling but in other areas of the game he fades but if he works on them the sky's the limit for wee Suso.

Worried- Lallana. Good player. Not a top player. He was excellent for Southampton last season, but Liverpool is a much bigger team and I think he may find it difficult. The injury doesn't help- he really has to hit the ground running to impress the fans and the media. For him to come into the team, he will probably have to dislodge either Coutinho or Sterling, which is a big ask. He may have pressure from Markovic, if he makes an immediate impact.

But first, answers!

1) No it's not a big deal, everyone moves to private accommodation for the second year anyway so all of the club nights and events are already catered to people who have to travel. There is also taxis and you can always arrange for one person to be a designated driver for the night. Also you live fairly close by so worst case scenario you have a slightly tiring walk home.

2) Definitely cheaper than London, but that's not saying much because everywhere is cheaper than London, except Dubai probably. I would say it's expensive but then I'm tighter than a miser when it comes to money.

3) Safety isn't really a huge issue, well, personally I've never been pickpocketed or burgled. But obviously it depends on where you live and where you go really, I imagine there are definitely some areas where it's more likely but not around UWE areas. As long as you just play it smart and keep your valuables in a safe place you'll be okay.

I mean I wear jeans and have a bulky phone case and wallet, so I literally could not be pickpocketed even if I wanted to because it's a pain in the ass trying to get anything out of jean pockets.

What will begin as a routine press conference is abruptly interrupted by a bellowing voice echoing from the back of the congregated group of reporters. ""When is Romelu going to sign, Roberto?"" All eyes shift to the back of the room as people look to see who would rudely interrupt a press conference in this manner. The same voice speaks out again ""I'll tell you when .. RIGHT NOW!"" The man rips a fake moustache from his face as a cascade of gasps engulfs the room. ""It's Romelu Lukaku, King!"" bellows Jim Ross who is the chief reporter for the Liverpool Echo now. Photographers snap pictures of Rom as he signs 14 separate contracts tying him down for the next 315 years at Everton.

Glitter starts to drop from the ceiling. The group of reporters, who are still startled by the Lukaku revelation, begin to become aware of the unnatural phenomenon. Nobody can see. The fog like glitter is completely clouding the vision of all those in the room. A silhouette appears from above and is heading towards the crowd. Ronaldinho is zip lining in to the press conference. ""You think I'd miss this party?"" questions Ronaldinho as Roberto Martinez helps unharness his new Brazilian playmaker. The journalists can't control themselves and begin to chant ""ECW! ECW! ECW!"". 

Sky Sports News cut back to the studio where anchors Charlotte Jackson and Jim White are trying to make sense of the pandemonium. Jim White, fingers to his ear piece, is left bamboozled and unprofessionally tries to get the cameras to focus solely on Charlotte Jackson whilst he composes himself. The camera man obliges and cuts to Charlotte Jackson but something is fishy. Charlotte Jackson isn't usually a black man. The unknown man tears the blonde wig from his head and reveals himself as Manuel Fernandes. ""Room for one more?"" My favourite Everton player is back. The back boards that make up the Sky Sports News studio fall down to reveal that we are actually still at the Everton press conference. The place is still going wild. The congregated reporters have aged tremendously as their frail human bodies couldn’t take the extreme nature of the Everton press conference.

Martinez has now shaved his head and is sitting in a psychokinetic floating wheelchair. Everton have re-branded as the X-Men (X for Xtreme) and history now shows they have won 3 World Cups.

In fact I'm talking the chance to repost something I wrote for a *""What historical themed game would you like to see made?""* question someone asked a while back, because while ""olde world"" it's setting is VERY English and full of English humour / writing.   

**Dick Turpin: Highwayman** 

It would sit somewhere between Assassins Creed and an 18th Century Grand Theft Auto. Lots of sword play, musketry, horse riding, and chasing down carriages on misty heathland, and issuing the time honoured challenge ""STAND &amp; FUCKING WELL DELIVER!!!"" 

A huge open world, threaded along the roadways and tunrpikes of 18th C England. Loads of Characters who look like they stepped out of a Hogarth print. It would be very Adult, lots of bawdy earthy humour and vast quantities of Tits, Gin and Brandy. 

A system of notoriety, would mean robbing poor people of a parish would see you become unpopular in an area, increasing your chance of being hounded out or even lynched, but by ""good"" deeds and gold you can win / buy the loyalty of people, inn keepers, or even whole villages! Meaning you can maintain a system of boltholes and safe houses! The ever-present threat of the Kings Thief takers, who want to hand you over to the hang man, or possibly even worse the constant danger from the Press gangs roaming the countryside and forcing men into service in the Royal navy would keep you on your toes. 

Throw your lot in with smugglers bringing brandy and tobacco, moon lit fights with the Customs and excise men, lighting beacons on hilltops to warn smugglers ships or even to draw honest ships onto the rocks!

The soundtrack would be done by Craig Armstrong (who did the fantastic Plunkett &amp; Macleane original score) 

As well as voice, Like LA Noir it would feature loads of Motion Captured real actors, including

&gt; Does imposing a dress code amount to sex discrimination?

&gt; This depends. Employers can treat men and women differently, as long as they don’t treat one or other of the sexes less favourably. Therefore, a dress code is not required to make provisions that are identical for men and women (e.g. everyone must wear a shirt and tie), but to avoid discrimination a code must provide (in this instance) a common principle of smartness.

For all the extra billions lumped into the NHS it's hard to see where this reaches the front lines. 

Maybe it's time to bring the NHS back to its original intentions of providing healthcare for British people. This isn't a ""damn those johnny foreigners"" rant but it's simple economics. 

The NHS cannot afford to provide free care for everyone. If you're a tourist then get insurance as the British must when biting another country. End reciprocal agreements that never get billed back correctly. 

It sounds harsh but the NHS attracts health tourism because it's a known soft touch. 

It's also time to limit what can and cannot be done on the NHS. I really don't think it should be funding tattoo removal and gender re assignments while it's a postcode lottery as to what cancer treatment you can receive.

It would be good if Universities could charge lower interest rates to students with better predicted grades who are deemed more likely to get a good degree and pay it back, and to students studying STEM subjects which historically have a higher rate of return.

Seriously though, you aren't going to find anything as efficient as the MRT, but transport is getting better, if possible I would suggest getting a moped to nip around, but a bicycle will be more than adequate. 

Fishponds I am not too sure about, but on the whole if you are sensible with locks etc, your goods should not be stolen, we are allegedly ""a cycling city"" but it's not perfect for cyclists and there are quite a few hills.

In terms of boozing on a night, it can be quite cheap, again certainly not Singapore expensive for a beer (maybe I was going to the wrong places). There are plenty of student friendly bars, Gloucester Road is a good spot to check out. ~ Aim for about £20-£40 for a good night out.

As for living in a private share, this could be even better for you as you might get a bit of peace and quiet when necessary, whilst you can still go to all of the events that UWE will run in terms of nights out, just sign up to what you want when you get there, there is plenty of social stuff to get involved in in that respect.

Banks, meh, they are all pretty much the same, shop around for the best student bank deal (in terms of interest free overdraft on the current account), for me 5 years ago it was HSBC. ~ actually just read your bit about not getting a student account, in that case check either Nationwide or HSBC for what they can do for you, I think if you get a basic account you can still make withdrawals from any ATM without a charge unless it specifically states so (you get a lot of these types of ATM in bars/gig venues where you are stuck paying the fee).

We are a pretty laid back city in terms of smoking weed, if hanging out on college green near the town centre, you are likely to be approached or someone will sort you out at uni. Price wise, man I couldn't tell you any more.

Rodgers' success last season came *despite* the transfer committee, not because of them. There were the failures to sign Mkhitaryan, Costa, Willian, Salah and Konoplyanka, the largely unimpressive returns on Aspas, Alberto, Moses and Cissokho, and them stating in January that they ""couldn't find a suitable CB"" to sign.

This summer, the transfer focus has been markedly different from previous windows. Lallana, Lovren, the near-signing of Remy; we're going for ""PL-proven"" players entering their peak years. Lallana and Lovren weren't value for money, but Rodgers doesn't care - they're the players he wants, and he doesn't want to gamble on cheaper options that may turn out OK.

You're right, city centres are high-density in terms of business.  That's why I have to travel over 10 miles if I want to buy something I actually need.  I don't drive so that's a problem.  Retail parks are so out-of-the-way that it seems they're only for people privileged enough to own a car.

You know what my village has?  About 15 hairdressers and a few small shops.  The city centre having more numbers by definition doesn't mean the surrounding areas should have to degrade into near-silent high streets of closed shutters with the instructions being to get on a train if you're looking for work or life.",0,1406640659,null,0,false,0,cjayksn,t3_2by3he,t1_cjayksn,t1_cjaxmz8,null,1434955675,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Head away from city center/university if you want somewhere quiet. Stick to the train or bus routes for access to town though.  South Belfast around the Ormeau Road/ Malone road would probably be best suited. Slightly more upmarket and quieter.

Cars over here will prob work out more expensive than you're used to. Insurance is very high and cost of petrol is going to be comparatively higher. If you want to visit a lot of different towns etc then a car would be handy, if you're just wanting it to get to town and back i'd say just use public transport.

true,TechJesus,null,null,"To take the reasons I shouldn't trust the Sun point by point:

&gt; 1. There’s a motive behind this coverage

By this logic I should not trust Left Food Forward, which is also a biased publication. Of course the logic is spurious. To paraphrase *Private Eye* editor Ian Hislop, just because somebody has an axe to grind does not mean they are lying, and having a political agenda does not invalidate your argument. This point is mere *ad hominem*. 

&gt; 2. There is no financial crisis in the NHS 

Only hours of hard research would be able to answer the question one way or the other, but this point is definitely in dispute. [A report from the Nuffield Trust](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28235850), a health charity, had the surplus for 2012/13 at £400m, and a deficit of -£100m the following year.

Why the difference between the figures? As with most disparities in reports like this, it is down to how things have been measured. Checking [the actual National Audit Office Report](http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/10220-001_Indicators-of-financial-sustainability-in-the-NHS.pdf), on page 10 it gives some of the methodology, but not being a man of finance it baffles me.

I'm not saying the blogger is wrong on this, but his research is definitely lacking.

&gt; 3. Even the US people think the NHS is the best health care system 

The survey he cites is [Mirror, Mirror on the Wall](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2014/jun/1755_davis_mirror_mirror_2014.pdf), conducted by private health charity the Commonwealth Fund. It caused quite a stir when it was released in June, but it is really an amalgamation of several surveys rather than an objective study (see page 28), which would carry far more weight in an argument such as this. The survey doesn't really show which healthcare systems are better, it shows which ones are better liked, which is the sort of test you'd expect the NHS to win, given its totemic importance in British politics.

&gt; 4. The ‘crisis’ – if there is one – is partly a result of government cuts and privatisation

&gt; Despite NHS funding being maintained by the government, it is not matched to demand. Therefore the system is having to deal with increased demand while funding remains the same. Anyone would understand this is a recipe for disaster.

Most people with basic economic literacy would understand that people buy more of the same product when the price is lower. Buyers tend to determine the highest price they are willing to pay for something in a given context, so if a seller lowers their price they capture a greater percentage of the potential market.

""Demand"" in the context of a health service is not fixed, even if we accept that on a given day people are suffering a given amount of health problems. When a service is free more people are likely to make use of it than if it costs even a nominal fee. For example a person with the flu might visit a GP if it is free, but if it cost £20 they might simply wait it out. Bearing in mind people also factor in costs in terms of time, hassle and quality of service received, the demand will fluctuate. 

The author also doesn't really provide any evidence to back up his assertion that cuts and privatisation are what has damaged the service; it is a bald assertion. 

&gt; 5. Money comes from somewhere

Despite what the author says, the core value of the NHS is not that it is free for everyone. Almost everybody pays for the NHS at some point in their lives through tax, therefore the core value of the NHS is that it is largely taxpayer funded, as opposed to being funded through private transactions. 

Whether raising taxes would result in better outcomes is also a bald assertion, and a questionable one at that given the phenomenon of capital flight, as well as the rational behaviour of investors. [Some argue that lowering marginal tax raises tax receipts](http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2012/10/15/do-tax-cuts-increase-government-revenue/), but this can only be true until a point.

I did V fest... look out for any good offers before you leave - I think we got free pimms cause we printed off a voucher. 

Get spare batteries or a non-plug in charger for your phone and make sure you have everyone's phone number.

Look around for the food bargains (I seem to remember some £2 garlic baguettes that were much better than the £6 burgers). You can try and cook on a camp fire but most people can't be bothered. 

Bring plenty of booze but also drink lots of water ([this sort of thing](http://www.gosplash.com/en/index.html) can be good to make tap water taste nicer).

I took army boots to the festival... more grip than trainers and pretty waterproof in the mud - best of both worlds. You can get cheap ones off ebay for  £15.  Take lots of socks - primark do some padded sports ones - good for your feet to stop the rubbing but cheap enough to throw away (and trust me you will want to throw them away!)  

Face wipes are great for freshing up, cleaning hands after portaloos, cleaning everything else in the mud! Also antibac gel is good as well.

Binbags for sitting on, storing stuff in, an extra cover over a cold sleeping bag and everything. 

Raincoat (or binbag) &amp; umbrella (maybe), jumper (even if it's hot), hat and sunscreen - during one set I needed all three! 

Separate your money in to different pockets, purses and bags - at least if one gets nicked then you don't loose it all. But it is good to keep in the bottom of sleeping bag overnight.

Don't accept any strange food, pills or drinks from anyone - just to be safe.

Attach glowsticks to your tent or glow in the dark paint so you can find it at night. 

Arrange a meeting point for once or twice a day in case of losing people - some where out of the way of the crowds.

Water flask - the squishable ones are good.

true,stevemegson,null,null,"I might have said something like ""unnecessary"" rather than frivolous as FreddyDeus did, but surely there's a problem when only 18% of claims reach a hearing?

The decrease in single claims was 59%. The government expected that early reconciliation would reduce claims by 25%, and the figures are roughly consistent with that (previously about 33% settled, now it's 16%, so unless ACAS suddenly got much worse at their job we might assume that the ""missing"" settled claims were settled in early conciliation). That still leaves the number of single claims down by about 45%, which is still a scary number, but it's not 80%.

In the absence of any figures from ACAS to show how much they're really reducing the number of claims, we can't say much about what that drop means.

Maybe the introduction of fees is deterring people with valid claims from even starting the free conciliation process so fewer claims even reach ACAS. 

Maybe ACAS is outperforming forecasts and reducing the number of claims by much more than expected, though they'd have to be settling at least 65% of claims overall to fully explain the drop. Even if that's true, maybe more people are accepting conciliation settlements because they don't want to pay the fee, and so accept a worse outcome than they'd have received from a tribunal.

Maybe the fee is deterring frivolous cases from getting past conciliation, but the success rate of claims has actually dropped. Maybe the valid claims are more likely to be settled in conciliation, and the tribunal is left to deal with the dubious cases where ACAS sided with the employer but the claimant insisted on proceeding.

We should possibly be worried that the percentage of claims withdrawn has increased significantly, from 28% to 58%.

He didnt have a rest during the summer and was injured for most of the World Cup, playing half fit at times.  That hamstring seems to be a persistent problem but a half fit Aguero still scores goals. I'm not convinced by Negredo either but Dzeko and Jovetic can easily pick up the slack.

I'd agree with your second point in principle, but not with Lavezzi. I don't think he's good enough for it to apply.

I don't want us to pointlessly try to replace Suarez, because it can't be done, but I do want our final attacker to replace one of our current starting front 6 (other than Sturridge).

Lavezzi would probably edge it, but there's not enough of a leap in quality and he doesn't offer a different enough option for him to be worth getting, I don't think.

If you could have two of the following I'd be all for him:

Secondly, [when an international panel of experts](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/17/nhs-health) finds that infact the NHS is one of the best health care systems in the west it is quite apparent to me that this is a politically motivated attack on one of the very foundations that modern Britain is built upon, a National Health Service.

I welcome media outlets putting forward informative articles about the NHS that bring its problems to the attention of the public so that they can be discussed and worked out.

But, Rodriguez and Lennon are two completely different players who were used for completely different reasons on the wing so comparing the goal scoring isn't entirely fair.  

Rodriguez was asked to be a player who contributed goals, and Poch really leveraged this perfectly with him.

Lennon on the other hand....his role has always been to be, for lack of a better description, a disruptor or a nuisance to the opposing defence.  His  job is to make sure that the opposing team can't crowd the middle or shift the defence heavily to the other side of the pitch...with his pace and his interplay with the RB and right sided midfielder (which regardless of his flaws has always been very good) he was basically asked to ensure that he could pull defenders over to the flank rather than leave him alone.  He wasn't expected to score goals....just keep the opponents honest defensively.

Problem is....we need more than someone to be a nuisance on the pitch, we need someone who is a complete threat to either score or create when he is on the ball out on the wing....that just isn't Lennon.

If you take into consideration how many absolutely foolish, waste of money, signings we made in recent history and the situation at LB right now it makes some sense that Moreno might not be worth £20m to us.

We have a fit Enrique again, and we know Flanno can fill in if needed there, so I think LFC may be leaning toward a cheaper young LB (like Bertrand) that might have slightly less evident potential but be far less risky while still being a good backup for Enrique from the outset.

I am also very hopeful that their unwillingness to splurge on Moreno indicates that they might be looking to bring in a left *and* right back before the window closes.

true,paleogirl,mccoy,McCoy,"&gt; Only if the attraction wasn't mutual.

Could not disagree more. If a 70-year-old acts on an non-mutual attraction to a 20-year-old where there is no power imbalance, that is somewhere on the scale from sad to creepy, depending on what form the ""action"" takes. The 20-year-old will turn them down and that's the end of it.

If a 70-year-old acts on a mutual attraction to a 20-year-old where there is no power imbalance, that's wonderful and I wish them the best.

If a 70-year-old acts on a non-mutual attraction to a 20-year-old where a power imbalance exists, that usually falls afoul of some sort of law or rule (think college professor&gt;student or employer&gt;employee) and the 70-year-old should be dealt with under that law or rule.

If the 70-year-old acts on a mutual attraction to a 20-year-old where a power imbalance exists, that is inherently unethical (or ""skeevy"" if you want to go back to my original post), because the individual with more power can never be sure that the individual with less power is acting out of free will, versus acting out of fear of reprisal during the course of the relationship.

The ethically correct course of action in this case is to rectify the power imbalance before proceeding with the relationship. So the college professor either waits until the student graduates, or moves to a different institution or career. The employer either gives up his position in the business, or the employee moves to a different place of work. In this way, negative repercussions within the relationship if things go sour no longer have the threat of destroying the livelihood or future prospects of the person with less power.


&gt; Remember, some people are just like that.
&gt; The problem with Doctor/companion romance...
&gt; Yes i agree there is a power and knowledge imbalance there which can be considered problematic concerning any romantic capacity.
&gt; But lets consider that when a billionaire decides to marries some hoe people generally don't complain. Its just what happens after all. On top of that many movies which have some common girl being swept away by a rock star or something generally aren't opposed to on those grounds either.
&gt; Not to suggest i like the idea of the Doctor being with any of his companions at all. I'm just pointing out that comparable circumstances are found to be non-controversial.

To me, those circumstances aren't particularly comparable, though. Everyone knows that if the billionaire's trophy wife decides to leave, she's going to extract ridiculous amounts of money from the old guy through divorce court. Same for the rock star's girlfriend-- she'll have someone ghost write a tell-all biopic and make a couple million in book sales, with movie rights to follow.

To me, a comparable situation would be more like this: 

A rich, globe-trotting widow and a penniless but charming and hunky 22-year-old guy fresh out of college fall in love. The widow offers to take the guy on the trip of a lifetime, exploring tribal culture in out-of-the-way places around the world.

He doesn't need to bring any of his own money; she'll take care of everything-- after all, she's rich! They have a great time seeing exotic places, where she hires translators and facilitators for them because none of the natives speak English. It's all great for awhile.

Every once in awhile, though, something happens that worries him. Maybe he finds out that she has, in the past, abandoned her companions with no warning when the relationship became inconvenient (*School Reunion*). Or they have a fight about something, and she threatens to buy a plane ticket back to civilization and leave him stranded in a strange, dangerous place with no money or resources (*Father's Day*).

He starts to realize that if he pisses her off, there's a very real possibility that she could fly away and leave him stuck without money or a passport in a place where he doesn't even speak the language and has no marketable skills. If she makes a decision he disagrees with, what are the odds now that he feels completely free to stand up for himself?

*That's* the kind of power imbalance we're talking about, here. And it's why Doctor/River doesn't bother me at all (neither does Doctor/Romana or Doctor/Tasha Lem), but Doctor/Rose makes me want to throw things at the TV.

The committee is composed of Rodgers, a head scout, Ayers and another guy (can't remember who, but I think he's on the money side). You'd typically involve all of these people in the purchasing and identifying of targets.

There might be a shift in that the people at the top, i.e. the Fenway guys, are more trusting in Rodger's judgement now than they were last year, and so are taking his word for it more. Or they might think that he's shown himself as a coach such that he can take more of the risk on his own shoulders. Or the finances have improved so that we don't have to budget in our transfers in quite the same way.

There's a lot changed in the last year, both on and off the pitch, which has contributed to the ""change"" in transfer strategy.

No insurance? No driving. Driving without insurance against third party risk is an absolute offence, and will earn you 6 penalty points plus a fine. Since you're a new license holder, earning 6 points will cause your license to be revoked. 

You'd have to reapply for a provisional, which when you do will come with the original 6 points on it.

If you can't afford insurance, you can't drive a car that's not a professional instructor's.

Who told you that? Its absolute rubbish.

Pay an instructor to teach you. Lessons cost about £25 per hour, and often can be bought at bulk discount (e.g. 10 hours for £200). Cost includes use of the car, fuel, insurance, maintenance, and professional tuition

&gt;

&gt;__Economy 7__ is the name of a [differential tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_tariff) provided by [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity) suppliers that uses [base load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load) generation to provide cheap off-peak electricity during the night.

&gt;Houses using the Economy 7 tariff require a special electricity meter which provides two different readings - one for electricity used during the day, priced higher, and the other for the night, priced lower. The night (off-peak) period lasts for a total of seven hours, hence the name; however it may or may not be a continuous period, [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] as it may alternate between the two prices during the night.

&gt;The first mention of Economy 7 is in 1978:  ""A new off-peak tariff known as the 'Economy 7' tariff was introduced in October [1978]. It featured a seven-hour night rate some 20 per cent cheaper than most night-time tariffs, made possible by economies in the night-time operation of the system."" In more recent years the difference between day and night rates has become much larger, with typically over 50% reduction   (though dependent on the supplier). Choice of the Economy 7 tariff results in either or both of an

Bath I've no idea. But you're getting into cider country in that direction so you should try some local stuff.

A passion for mathematics is an absolute must. I, for example, read numerous books on the subject, and so learned algebra when I was in year 3.

You should have read lots of recreational mathematics, or at least mathematical gems never covered in a high-school syllabus. Things like different cardinalities of infinities, or perhaps proof that there are infinite primes, etc.

Other mathematics-related interests (e.g. logic puzzles, programming, certain languages like Latin or Lojban) will also be a plus, so long as they're mentioned in your personal statement.

Being extremely good at mathematics (we're talking predicted A*s in A2) will definitely be needed, though that often comes with the passion.

Being able to draw graphs well, solve complex problems (which you probably won't have seen before) quickly, and express your ideas clearly will likely all be needed for the interview, if you get to that stage.

Knowing about the history of mathematics depends on your college. For some colleges, they will ask you only questions directly related to your mathematical ability. For others, they may ask you ""Which mathematician, dead or alive, would you like to have dinner with?"" or something equally inane. If you can get through these questions better than everyone else, you've likely got this in the bag.

Quite simply putting it, though, it's not the sort of thing you'll be able to get into within two years if you don't particularly like mathematics.

 [**American cheese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20cheese): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__American cheese__ is a type of [processed cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processed_cheese). It can be orange, yellow, or white in color, is mild and faintly sweet in flavor, has a medium-firm consistency, and has a very low [melting point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point). American cheese was originally only white in color—as it had been made from a blend of cheeses (most often [Colby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_cheese) and [Cheddar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddar_cheese))—however, the modern version can also be artificially colored to a yellowish hue. Today’s American cheese is generally industrially manufactured from a set of ingredients such as one or more cheeses, milk, [whey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey), [milkfat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkfat), [milk protein concentrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_protein_concentrate), whey protein concentrate, saturated oil(s), [emulsifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsifier), and salt. Because its ingredients differ so much from those of ""unprocessed""/raw/natural cheeses,  American cheese can not be legally sold under the name (authentic) ""[cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese)"" in the US. Instead, federal (and even some state) laws mandate that it be labeled as ""[processed cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processed_cheese)"", ""cheese product"", ""cheese food"", etc. As a result, sometimes even the *word* ""cheese"" is absent, altogether, from the product's labeling in favor of, e.g., ""American slices"" or ""American singles"". In Canada, exactly the same product—often by the same manufacturer and with the same packaging as in the US—was once sold as ""Canadian cheese"" or ""Canadian slices""; today, most such product in Canada is vaguely labeled just ""slices"" or ""singles"". In the United Kingdom, packs are labeled as ""singles"",  although it is commonly referred to as ""cheese slices"".

Where have I said anything about posts on Reddit? Where have I mentioned anywhere that I think that posts on here should be mainstream? We're talking about the strength of the pro-Palestinian movement as being representative of the views of the UK as a whole. Who's talking about *Reddit* posts apart from you?

Additionally, what does my posting history have to do with anything? I like how you managed to miss 'politics' out of the topics I post about, given that it's making up about 80% of my frontpage right now. Nice to see some argumentative integrity there! In one of your recent posts you say that British people would vote Hitler into power if it served their own economic interest. See, I can take things out of context that have nothing to do with the argument and shoe-horn them in too!

Here's what your original post says:

&gt;Palestine solidarity goes mainstream in the UK as 100,000 march on London

&gt;public opinion is leaving the politicians and traditional media, still stuck in their backing for the colonizer, Israel


The article you've linked to is suggesting that 100,000 people showing up to protest means that pro-Palestinian sentiment is now the mainstream opinion on this debate, whereas previously nobody had cared about Palestine at all. The politicians are out of touch because 100,000 people support Palestine and, by inference, that means that *fewer* people support Israel. Nowhere are these assertions cited or backed up in any way.

The problem is that 100,000 people turning up to a rally (and let's not even get into where those figures come from) is not necessarily indicative of something that denotes widespread support in the UK, just an ability to mobilise a small number of dedicated resources. The reason I referenced fox hunting is because pro-hunting lobbies are *consistently* in the minority in every opinion poll in the UK, and yet they managed to get four times as many people on the street as the Palestinian rally. Hell, the Tamil Rights march in 2009 claim to have got 100,000 and do you really think that the majority of people in the UK give a crap about the rights of Tamils in Sri Lanka? 

A turnout of 100,000 just doesn't mean anything in the grander scheme of things and to suggest it does is more than a little hyperbolic, which was the point of my first post.

Finally, thanks for this bit of comedy:

#

* **Departures** ""PLayers who left wanted to leave, wanted a shortcut to champions league, those that stay are prepared to get champions league the hard way""

* **Asked if FFP was involved** ""No transfers were made for financial reasons alone, prepared to have players stay in southampton, even against their wishes, if prices weren't met""

* **Earnings** ""Excited to start rebuilding, there will be players coming in""

* **Been quiet** ""Stayed silent to get the best deals for the club""

* **J-Rod &amp; Schneiderlin** ""Jay Rodriguez and Morgan Schneiderlin are a core of the club, not for sale and will not be leaving the club, those stories are false""

* **Fan reaction** ""September is judgement day, we are in a process right now, please withhold judgement until the window closes basically""

* **Koeman** ""Koeman done an outstanding job so far . . . we need more players and more depth in our line up . . . not about getting them in now or tomorrow it's about getting the right players for Koeman that want to play attractive football""

* **When asked if the rumoured GK, defender and forward supposedly coming in this week actually are coming soon:** ""I dont what to put that pressure on anybody, we are very close to a few deals, we are close to kicking off now, for Koeman we know he wants them as soon as possible to start integrating them but we are working as quickly as possible I don't like to speak in definites when I don't know them""

* **Koeman impressed with the youth?** ""He is we have the best facilities academy blah blah, Koeman is impressed Les Reed, Martin Hunter doing outstanding, building great players and great people, this kind of character we are looking for in new arrivals so we have a squad pulling in all the same direction""

* **You like Koeman?** ""He has no ego, he is here for Southampton and dedicated to the future and has a long term plan to build with us, has been patient with the executive board who are new here, again has no ego and leads by example, not just in it for short term stint to get to the next level"" (lol fuck you pochettino?)

* **Behind the scenes** ""Fighting and battling behind the scenes and the fans will be pleased with the results in the end""

* **What are your aims this season?** ""Important to stay away from numbers, since jan built entirely new board and new coaching staff, fans need to know there is a product on the field playing good football and can beat any other premier league team, let the numbers and positions fall naturally, we will have an attractive competitive team that opposition need to be wary of, we respect the changes that have happened they take time need to be patient and understand the results might not come in right off the bat but they will come in time with the people and team we are building throughout the club.""

Let me preface by saying that obviously, every player we sign has to ultimately be approved by Rodgers. But I do think a distinction can be made as to what extent targets are 'sold' to Rodgers by the committee, or vice versa - how often is Rodgers 'selling' a target to the committee. And not every target needs to be sold as much as others. Nothing fancy; just like any decision-making process where different team members have different thoughts.

I reckon Sturridge &amp; Coutinho were players recommended to Rodgers by the committee. Sturridge had been available in the summer (when the committee wasn't formed yet, because City were smart about the exit terms of their former scouts), and we knew of his availability. Apparently we either passed on him, or we wanted to loan him and he wasn't interested in anything less than a full move. So for us to go back in for him in January doesn't seem like it was a move driven by Rodgers.

Coutinho, mostly because up until that point Rodgers had shown a preference for picking up players with previous experience of playing in England; as we're seeing again in this window.

I don't think he'll ever be able to reach a position in which he'd garner regular starts, but he's got the physical talents that make him worth putting at least another year or two in.

That by no means guarantees that he'll be able to transform his game, and refine his skill set so as to reach that potential, it's simply a nod to the fact that said potential is there. However, if anyone can get the most out of a player, it's Mourinho.

Also, when asking the question, that gives the QI elves the opportunity to explain to the person in question why there's no such thing as an audio-only QI. 

And the person asking the question then knows that if he encounters such audio files, that they were made without permission, and can report the creator of said audio files to the makers of QI, who can then start civil offense suits against the creator of the audio files.

Asking questions like these should never be punished.

Lisburn road is a fairly cheap place to live. if you want to share with some students you could get a room for around £80.00 per month. a 2 bedroom house rent wise is going to be between 400-500 if its in an ok area.

Not sure what your usage is but my bills are around £40 a month for gas and a little more for power. 

Food is more expensive here than it is in the USA 2 Liters of milk will cost you around £1 Bread is anywhere between £1.20 and £4.00.

true,onecelledcreature,null,null,"if you're into US craft beer, then there's going to be some differences to what you drink here.

In most pubs, you'll find a selection of [generic lagers](http://i.imgur.com/b17rDbm.jpg) (stella, carling becks etc) 

And then there will be a few hand cask pumps, mostly they're going to be big UK breweries probably from whoever the Pub's landlord brewery is (maybe [Thwaites](http://i.imgur.com/oa1pQXr.jpg), [Robinsons](http://i.imgur.com/jDgiaCI.jpg), [Marstons](http://i.imgur.com/ZiaV79E.jpg) This will vary regionally)
These beers are going to be mostly english pale ales or traditional IPAs, they'll be flatter than you're used to but most of the big brewery beers are inoffensive, although similar..

On the hand pumps, most pubs will have a guest ale on, this will usually be from a local microbrewery. For me, this would be my choice, as generally there is good variety, and more craftsmanship in these beers.
The microbreweries you are likely to find on cask in general are going to be the slightly larger ones, like [BathAles](http://www.bathales.com/) or [Darkstar](http://darkstarbrewing.co.uk/), the rest are going to be local to where you are.

Most small UK breweries, focus on cask ale, however there are now a lot of smaller breweries who are putting out a lot more kegged beer, which is closer to the US style craft beer.
Some of my favourites, are [Magic Rock](http://www.magicrockbrewing.com/), [RedWillow](http://www.redwillowbrewery.com/), [kernel](http://www.thekernelbrewery.com/), [Meantime](http://meantimebrewing.com/) [Beavertown](http://www.beavertownbrewery.co.uk/), (I’m focusing on beers, that are going to be easy to find)

I noticed it’s been downvoted below, but [brewdog](http://www.brewdog.com/) is a really good suggestion, they’re one of the largest independent breweries, and most of what they do is more in line with US craft beer. They seem to get people worked up, as they try to be very in your face, but they're undeniably pushing more interesting beer to the frontline of UK shops and bars, and getting more people interested in beer in general.

They now also have a lot of bars across the country.([Bar Map](http://www.brewdog.com/bars)) I would recommend going to one of their bars and sampling what they have. 
They often have around 15 [taps](http://i.imgur.com/g8C5BwJ.jpg), with a 60/40 split of brewdog beer and UK/import beer, plus a massive bottle selection from everywhere else.

Generally their staff are well versed in beer, and if you asked them for some different examples of UK beer they would help you out. They definitely have bars in London and Newcastle so you should be near one or two.

Otherwise, just explore! It would be wise to avoid any pubs that appear to be part of a chain, (look out for chalk boards advertising sky sports) If you see a pub with free house above the sign, the beer choice is likely (but not always) to be more varied and interesting than others in the area.

Mostly that's just my opinion on whats going on in the UK, there is good beer everywhere, but sometimes you need to look for it. 
The US style craft is not massive right now, but it's building

Now the Greizmann link was absolute bullshit and it was 100% plain to see it was complete and utter bullshit, people jumped all over it because it sounded fantastic...but it was bullshit from the very beginning and it was pretty fucking obvious that it was nothing more than agent speak.

However it seems pretty likely that with all that smoke around MS and JR that there was/is a fire causing all of it and that is because we are in fact interested in bringing them in and Poch does want them.

Now as for us selling off players....of course we are going to look to sell off players, we all knew that...be it Dawson, Naughts, Rose or your choice of Sandro/Paulinho/Dembele/Holtby everyone knew we were going to look cut down the squad and specifically the midfield because we absolutely have to do so.  Generally speaking people try to sell earlier than buying because it ensures that you still have the leverage in that you have something someone wants and ""no reason to sell"", if we bring in more CMs (say MS) what does that do for your negotiations?...teams know you will be looking to offload someone, why bother offering good money on something that you know Spurs will be taking a bath on if they keep them.

We have no actual idea what is being quoted for any of the players but i have no problem with Levy trying to get the best deal he can....Take the rumour for Sandro, reportedly Napoli asked about him at below what we paid for him and we countered with a large number....well, thats how negotiations work (unless you are a PSG,CFC, City, Real, Barca or United)...both sides go to an extreme and then work towards the middle.

true,stevemegson,null,null,"They're not paying anything, but they're almost certainly not depriving the site of any revenue either. Project Sunblock's clients are almost certainly paying just as if their adverts had appeared instead of the police warning.

You give your Project Sunblock tag to the ad network in place of your real ad, and whenever the tag is served Project Sunblock will decide whether this is a site that you want to be seen on. They then display either your real ad, the police warning ad, or something else you provided if you've chosen not to let your ads serve on that site but it's not a site that the police care about. Either way, the ad network doesn't know what Project Sunblock chose to serve and as far as they're concerned you bought that impression and you'll pay for it. This works for Project Sunblock's clients because they end up paying a higher effective rate for the impressions that their ad does serve on, but avoid having their brand associated with undesirable sites. However, it doesn't cost the undesirable sites anything.

It's also possible for Project Sunblock to take part in real time bidding, so the ad network offers you the impression and you choose not to bid on it if it's not a site you want to appear on. This would reduce their revenue since there would be less demand for their inventory and someone else who bid less will serve an ad on that impression. However, that wouldn't allow the police warning to serve. If you want to serve an ad of any kind, you have to buy that impression from the ad network.

It's not inconceivable that the police could agree with the ad network to let them serve the warning ad for free, but if they've got that level of compliance from the ad network then Project Sunblock wouldn't be involved at all, they'd just get the ad network to stop serving anything on the target sites.",0,1406650271,null,0,false,0,cjb35dl,t3_2c0yiw,t1_cjb35dl,t1_cjaugj4,null,1434957832,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

*Selling bitcoin*
Was pretty easy to transfer funds to ATM although it printed out the receipt with a qr code on that I grabbed and originally thought would be the deposit address but wouldn't scan (was actually just a validation code to scan later when redeeming)

Had to wait 36 minutes for the required 1 confirmation for £10... Definitely need to streamline this!!! 
One suggestion is making an app that allows people to transfer the funds well before they visit the ATM.
( I make apps if Robocoin wants to chat :))
For instance have a receiving address that can be reused and any amount sent to it/redeemed later or return to address,


*Redeem ticket*

No keypad to type but had a flashing cursor on screen, it wasn't obvious to scan the printed ticket barcode with bottom right scanner that glowed red which really threw me, could do with a flashing red arrow on the screen or video of someone doing it perhaps since there were 5 scanners I could see on the machine.(2xpassport,hand,face and subtle barcode cam)

The robocoin machine shows a system error pressing next when nothing is scanned!  Made me swear as I thought it had crashed and taken my money! Actually looks like a software bug when no code is entered and next is pressed, nothing serious, but definitely should be rephrased in the next software update.

Wouldn't allow withdrawl until confirmation so would be nice again having the app ping you saying 'yes I've seen your transfer, all is good and just awaiting for network confirmation' and again another message saying when it's ready for collection.


Verdict: 
Excellent start and great to finally see in UK but clearly an early device with plenty to do on the software/UI before non tech people will be comfortable using it.


Seems surprisingly busy for new pioneering tech too, there were 6 people before me today as well and I'd be keen to use it again.
All in all the difficulties all seem easily fixable so satoshipoint looks a very promising company as long as Robocoin continue enhancing usability and don't become complacent.",0,1406651107,null,0,false,0,cjb3lk8,t3_2b95o6,t1_cjb3lk8,t3_2b95o6,null,1434958040,2,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,2

It's near byker and can be found by walking along the quayside from town. Check out Tyne bar, the freetrade (great river views), the cluny and the tanners.

We're in a very strong position knowing Ross will be here and can build a squad around his talent.  


That being said, I know we were all hoping for a new signing ^coughlukakucough but we have damn good reason to be chuffed as fuck at this news. Besides, Big Rom or whoever else could still happen - it just wont be today. Well fine, we've got plenty of time.

3) I feel very safe in Bristol, almost as safe as in Singapore. My Nigerian friend likes to say, ""Hey this is Bristol, nothing can happen!"" to justify leaving stuff unattended in my departmental building, haha. I've been to Easton with friends to buy international foods and actually I feel very at home there, coming from multicultural Malaysia despite my friends feeling uncomfortable walking there. Other than getting odd stares from people because I stick out. I like Bedminster too.

I've never heard of muggings and snatch thefts (these very common in Malaysia) and pickpocketing mostly happens in touristy areas of London. And burglary only happens in houses, I think especially student houses where students are likely to have at least a laptop and other expensive gadgets. The windows at my student accommodation only open up to a fraction because of this.

4) I was rejected by HSBC after they asked many intrusive questions and had to wait a week to hear the outcome. Barclays were very friendly. The international students' account gives a £ 10 overdraft and has the app for easily transferring money between current and savings, and a really convenient way of sending money to friends. You also get a debit card which you can personalise with a photo free-of-charge but no chequebook and they only send me statements to notify of bank transfers. 

I also have a basic Lloyds current account which I opened to get a chequebook and I get a debit card, £ 20 overdraft and printed statements (useful when you're required to provide proof of address later on) with it.

All banks (except NatWest, according to my friend who has a student account with them) allow you to withdraw from other ATMs for free. Even withdrawals from ATMs in corner shops or pubs are free as they're ad-supported.

true,Menessy27,null,null,"Well Porto had him but had a good RB already so loaned him out to a La Liga team and Braga. Then Sporting wanted him in a player swap when they were selling Izmailov to Porto so he went there. And last year he went on loan because Lyon offered around 1 million pounds for him on loan, and obviously a team like Sporting that struggles for cash will take that any day. But now Sporting have a really good young right back Cedric (who should be the Portuguese NT starter, hes very good) and dont want to pay Lopes's wages to just sit on the bench which is why they keep looking to loan him out again. He did well for Lyon last season and has said he has offers from teams in the EPL and Bundesliga. He's a good player. I doubt he'd be a starter right away but a good player who can play both RB and LB.

That guy was just completely exaggerating. Switching clubs because good teams wants you is hardly being a reject. By that logic Bale is a reject because both Southampton and Spurs sold him. Braga wanted him (the year they were in the CL), a La Liga team wanted him, Sporting wanted him, Lyon wanted him and now EPL/Bundesliga teams want him. And the Portuguese flop thing also makes no sense, he's simply a depth player for the Portuguese NT as they have several good fullbacks, hardly makes him a flop because he's not starting ahead of Coentrao or something.

I honestly don't know how to feel about this. I am not a big Lukaku fan, his skill set I mean, I don't give a fuck about his personality, but he is explosive. For those who say Drogba and Torres can teach him things. His first year at Chelsea he trained with both of them!! A player can't evolve with only training sessions, at that age you need to play, not everythig but still. If Drogba didn't came, I think he would have tried to compete but now he is having a Villas-Boas flashback. Maybe the reason he is leaving is because he doesn't get enough trust at our club. Buying a 36 year old icon of the club doesn't help. It signals a wrong message. 

If he goes I wish him all the best.

I'd also encourage you to check out steam greenlit http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight , a flawed but at least existing format for bedroom programming jobs to distribute to a wider market.  Indeed, check it out regularly, could already be what you want on it. 

Break out of the notion that it can't be done if your not a math's graduate and the terrible as fuck I.T we are taught these days. Give er a go. 

**ANYWAY**, plug for comp sci hobbism over. Long story short (orginally had a big speel). Mid 1990'ies -2000's lot of amalgamation went on. U.S games market in the English speaking world became allmost completely dominant. You also saw the rise of small game dev studios of 30-40 people pumping out a game every 2-3 years becoming essentially vassals of publishers, who allmost all ended up merging into giant multinational conglamerates (e.g. What happened to Eidos interactive ( or DMA design (now rockstarnorth)). Normally headquartered in the two bigger videogames markets, USA and Japan. 

So because of that, its mostly driven towards making things for the U.S market first, U.K market second. A game that might target the U.K market but alienate the U.S one, is simply bad buisness sense. 


Combine that with a graduate brain drain, and computing education going from one of the best in the world, to utter fucking garbage about MS word. 

and you only really have left a few major studios, either web to U.S focused publishers, or subsidiaries of multinationals. Because you need to make millions from a game when your operating budget per year due to wages is also millions. Only exceptions come in are companies like Jagex, but you can't really set fantasy or sci-fi games in the U.K in a meaningful way. 

BUT. BUT. BUT. BUT. The game's industry if fucked at present and undergoing a massive series of reversals. Most major companies have become so profit driven (a game a year, btw for the non-programmers out there - is not a thing you do if you want quality innovative code out of it. so its hackjob or reskin) they are producing gruel. Indy's now have direct access to the market, and there's nothing stopping bedroom teams blooming into office space with 2 dozen people plowing away at code or modeling.  

TL;DR we have a relatively healthy market and industry, its just been U.S focused because reasons. Now like the mid-late 1980'ies the situation is prime for doing it yourself and getting to an audience. So do that.

true,meninaeide,null,null,"A few of my friends do Maths there, and they're all normal people. They love maths, but if you're considering applying to Oxford to do it, you probably do too, so don't worry. 


For all subjects you need to be able to do the A-Level work for your subject happily and without too much difficulty, and that's the key. If you do it at University, especially Oxford, you're going to be doing a lot of it, so you have to be sure you enjoy it, and you can do it, but beyond that it's up to you. I would say that proofs would be a really valuable thing to look into, as they are *SUPER* important to Maths at Uni.


They don't want someone dull and boring who knows about Maths as a science and nothing else, because a person like that isn't fun to teach, so as long as you can talk to other humans, and have something interesting to say ('I play football for X-united U19s', or 'I love chess, and play at tournaments', or even 'I volunteer at a charity regularly') you don't need to worry about the interview, so long as you're good at Maths. The interview is to work out **how** you think, not *what* you think, as long as you show you can think on the spot and develop ideas you'll be okay on any left-field questions.


To answer your questions more succinctly - There is no general template, the only uniting factor is that they like and are good at maths They did do further reading, but it could be something like 'Flatland' if you want it to be fun, you just need to think about the concepts involved. The people who get into Oxford are people who know their subject and enjoy it, the people that thrive are the people who are happy to work hard at their subject and can do that without losing a social life.

If you have other questions let me know, and I'll do my best to answer them. I don't do Maths, but I almost did :)

The entire River storyline already had an ending before Moffat took over as showrunner, simply by design; the Amy and Rory plot ran its course and, in spite of a half-episode mourning period, everyone ended up fine. Clara is a woefully underdeveloped character (which is a shame, because I like Jenna Coleman and occasionally she manages to be quite charming--but really, her characterization doesn't go far beyond ""pretty governess who makes souffles and, oh yeah, is REALLY SUPER IMPORTANT for this one moment in Name of the Doctor before we forget all about that in the 50th and beyond).

true,lak47,lfc87,,"Every player will not score goals. Let's get that out of the way. Lavezzi is a general menace to defend against. Watch his Napoli games to see what he brings to the table. 

Cavani was the man in the box. Lavezzis job was to make sure the ball gets to his man and leave most of the goal scoring job to the finishers in the team. We have Sturridge who can run, dribble and finish. If he scores goals (Lavezzi) it'll be a bonus, and I'm sure Brendan can get the best out of Lavezzi. The more havoc we create for defenses, the better it's going to be. Napoli got good money for him, but they had exactly another Lavezzi in the making in the form of Lorenzo Insigne. Watch the kid play, he's a terror to defend against. Senor Benitez only solidifies that belief in saying that Insigne is a special, special talent. They appreciate him so much because they sold an older and experienced player and luckily replaced him like for like. 

Imagine Markovic, Coutinho, Lavezzi and Sterling running and committing defenders. Throw in Lallana to replace any of those. We'd me a nightmare to play against. Nightmare. 

Anyway, that's just my 2 cents on this whole episode. I would be fucking delighted if we got Ezequiel Lavezzi.

First of all, I owe you an apology, on two fronts:

First, my focus was so much on the content of the article that I hadn't fully registered the title. 

Second, my understanding of the word mainstream was that it was in the main stream of people's consciousness, not that it was a view shared by most. According to the OED, I was wrong.

(OED: The ideas, attitudes, or activities that are shared by most people and regarded as normal or conventional)

However:

&gt; Where have I said anything about posts on Reddit?
&gt; Who's talking about Reddit posts apart from you?

""I'm getting so fed up of these links being posted ... but you do have to slop that stuff around on Reddit?"" -- JamJarre

&gt; Additionally, what does my posting history have to do with anything?

You criticized my and others posting of these articles with, ""you think your particular political rally is super important"". So I drew attention to the frivolity of some of yours.

&gt; In one of your recent posts you say that British people would vote Hitler into power if it served their own economic interest. See, I can take things out of context that have nothing to do with the argument and shoe-horn them in too!

If that's an example of you shoe-horning in, you must have very uncomfortable feet ;)

&gt; ...because 100,000 people support Palestine and, by inference, that means that fewer people support Israel.

I fail to see how such an inference can be drawn. Or is that your point?

&gt; The problem is that 100,000 people turning up to a rally (and let's not even get into where those figures come from)

It was a guesstimate by the writer of the article.

All that aside, I still fail to understand why you are so worked up by this. British people don't march that much so, when they do, twice, in large numbers, it's news.

We could really use a goalscoring LW/LF and Rodriguez can play that role - while he won't be available right away he was probably viewed as a more cost-effective and attainable alternative to the likes of Griezmann (probably always a long shot and now obviously out of reach).  So I'd describe that as a genuine upgrade.

As for Schneiderlin, given our wealth of midfield options, the only reason I can see us going for him at all is that Poch doesn't like what he has and has identified Schneiderlin as a key signing.  If that's the case, as far as I'm concerned he's target number one.  I've seen several Southampton fans identify him as their best player over the past two seasons, the player they'd have least wanted to lose, and essential to their system.  If that's the case this is Moutinho all over again - we need to make the deal.

The bottom line is that it doesn't matter whether *I'm* happy with a given area of our squad or not - what matters is whether Poch thinks he has the tools he needs.  If he's asked for Schneiderlin then Schneiderlin isn't a luxury purchase, and our pursuit should reflect that.",0,1406656504,null,0,false,0,cjb6mdx,t3_2c1qrw,t1_cjb6mdx,t1_cjb1z9j,null,1434959536,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3
true,UnoAcoustic,null,null,"Oxford mathematician here, just finished second year!

There's so much variety that it's impossible to generalise beyond the trivial stuff (passion and talent for maths etc). You've probably got a higher proportion of introverted types than in some other subjects but even so the majority of the mathematicians I know are pretty confident and outgoing people (even shy people tend to gain a lot of confidence after a few months in uni).

From a personal perspective I did a fair bit of further reading before I came - mainly on the recreational side, plus some books of Olympiad questions which I worked through - and I'd say it's the same for most other Oxford maths students. University maths is different to A Level maths in many ways so it helps to have gotten a flavour of proofs and problems which involve some unconventional thinking.

As for who excels I'm not entirely sure. A good friend got a strong first this year while simultaneously swimming in the blues team and enjoying an active social life, so you don't have to dedicate your life to the subject to do well.

/u/edderiofer mentioned having a knowledge of the history of maths - you tend to pick that stuff up with wider reading but I've never heard of a college asking questions about it in the interview. That's not really what the maths degree is about (although you can do a module on history of maths in third year if you wish). Also I was never asked the differentiation/integration question - I'm surprised that it was asked in an interview (you spend the entire first year of the maths course deriving the theories of differentiation and integration, so you wouldn't be expected to know a proper proof already!)

I don't think looking for recommendations for particular beers is the right way to go, many bars rotate what they have on offer, and you're better drinking something local and fresh than a bottle of something bought in and stale.. Some tips:

* Real ale doesn't travel well. Stick to something local. You want to be drinking something made within 25-50 miles of where you're drinking it.

* We're not so much into lager here, the lagers you can buy are decent enough, but mostly bland and mass-produced. IPA's are good, but most here are significantly less ""fruity"" than the american ones, thanks to different hops. I prefer this, YMMV. Traditional amber or brown ale is always good, something you don't seem to have in the US, and incredibly drinkable. If you like something darker, we have many porters and stouts.

* The pub you're drinking in can affect the beer almost as much as the brewery. Check with CAMRA, make sure you're drinking in a place that looks after their beers well, and knows what they're doing.

* You want to take advantage of fresh cask beer, for the real British experience. Bottled stuff you can get back in the states..

* Absolutely ask for recommendations. Try a few, give your opinions, see if they can recommend you more. If the bar staff are hesitant to let you sample, or can't give you a good description of the beers on offer, then you're in the wrong pub, move on.

So, to recap:

 * Find the best places to drink in the area by checking with CAMRA.
 * Ask for recomendations, samples and advice from the bar staff.
 * Drink something local, and on tap. Avoid bottles unless there's something you *really* want to try.

**Also,** best case scenario, there will be a beer festival on somewhere while you're visiting. This is the best opportunity to try a selection of different beers.",0,1406656846,null,0,false,0,cjb6to5,t3_2c1jkl,t1_cjb6to5,t3_2c1jkl,null,1434959628,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

The company is legally required to have an independent bank account, you cannot use a personal one for it.

It sounds like you don't need much especially from a bank account but I would try to get one with a small overdraft just in case. Cash flow won't be as reliable as your currently experiencing in your permanent role so it's good to have a small buffer available *if you need it*.

I've no idea if that is a good deal compared to others from Lloyds but if to sounds good to you then go for it.

&gt;I'm really new to contracting, so I was hoping you guys with more experience could offer me some advice as how to best manage my money and accounts?

If the accountant is good then they should be able to help you with this. 

Without going into any great depth, a one person limited company is simple enough to manage the records of so long as you're organised and keep on top of it.

Basic excel spreadsheets, files of your invoices and receipts and copies of your bank statements are you will generally need.

&gt;Do I need to get VAT registered or anything like that?

Obviously discuss this with your accountant; but no, *not immediately*. 

The current compulsory VAT registration threshold is £81,000 in any given 12 month period. If you consistently earn £310 a day then you can see that you'll obviously be likely to hit that threshold within a year.

Typically you are normally required to place an order 45 minutes prior to the AVP to obtain that price.  Due to this, you do not know the price at which you will trade until after the order has been placed.

For example, XYZ Fund has an AVP of midday.  Subsequently, the platform has a cut off at 11.45am for orders at that AVP.  If you placed an order at 10am, you would trade at the valuation given at middday.  It then normally takes 24-48 hours for the provider to receive the pricing details from the fund manager and reconcile the trade to show on your account.

If you placed an order for XYZ Fund at 1pm, you will receive the following working day's valuation as you have missed the platforms cut off of 11.45am.

It's worth noting that not all funds are valued daily at the same time and some providers/platforms may require more notice (some might ask that for a midday AVP, the order if placed by 11am, for example).

Yes, that's why I used the word ""currently"".

&gt; The air vents are different, the 185 has smaller slits (as seen in the OP's post), versus the 158 with larger vents (as in your post).

Are you looking at the same image I am? [See here](http://imgur.com/a/nZe5b). 

The first image is the relection of the lights, with brightness/contrast adjusted for clarity. The distinct pairs of vents, with gaps aligning with the ends of the lights, looks like a much better match with [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/158768_transpenninexpress_Standard_Class_Interior.JPG) than [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/185137_Scarborough_MSO_Standard_Class.JPG).

The second image highlights the reflection of chairs visible in the lower part of the OP's photo. The general shape, the circular feature and the join between custions (blue line) seem to be a fairly close match to the seating in an [East Midlands Trains Class 158](http://www.gbrailway.co.uk/TrainInteriors/DMU-Interiors/Class-158-Interiors/i-JQWHpJf/0/L/158865-Interior-L.jpg), and entirely unlike the [seating on a Class 185](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2829/13200617923_d23e7d2f1e_z.jpg), which feature clear horizontal features on the rear and have one continuous cushion, as well as being a different shape.

This is kinda what pisses me off. We're backed by Levy &amp; ENIC, headed by no other than Billionaire Joe Lewis. We've ''made'' roughly 20m on transfers over the past few seasons and are aiming to raise the profile of the club. Yet it appears we're having to get rid of players for stupid fees (not just freeing up space) and getting cheap deals to sign *anyone*.  Look at our only business - Sig &gt; Vorm/Davies...it's win/win for both isn't it? it's not like we ''ripped them off''. They could argue a back up GK and a young LB for Sig, who we saw what can he can do on his Swansea debut is great business. 

There's like 2 weeks left and we haven't spent anything. I'm not sold on J Rod, he just strikes me as a budget Levy signing Poch knows works in the system but he's not taking us that next level. Do we literally *not* have a transfer budget, despite the masses of TV money and the fact we've earned more than we've spent? It's weird. And if Levy fucks around with Schneidierlin and Arsenal pick him up for like 15m I'm gonna be so pissed. Truly. it always appears like we ''spend alot'', but we don't. Net wise we don't really spend anything and go ''above &amp; beyond'' like other clubs, when we're nowhere near being in a position of putting us in debt when ol' Mr Lewis can just straight loan 50m on a whim. 

[Here's a very old, 2012 article that proves my point](http://worldsoccertalk.com/2012/07/10/the-billionaire-boys-club-why-its-time-for-tottenhams-joe-lewis-and-daniel-levy-to-spend/)

Liquidity - how easy is it to sell up.

Return - what do I get out of it.

Cost of holding it - management fees on some funds, agents fees on Buy to Let.

Buy to let, p to p, stocks, government bonds, cash savings accounts all have different scores on these characteristics.

For the moment, forget Schneiderlin... just thinking about the center of OUR midfield: 

I assume we'll run something of a 433/4231 (with two slightly deeper CMs and one more advanced).  

CMs: Dembélé, Paulinho, Bentaleb, Sandro, Capoue, Holtby*, Carroll**
AMs: Eriksen, Holtby, any of our wingers we may consider running there as we have this preseason.

    * Holtby may get played deeper, maybe not ** Carroll may not feature

Ok, so I don't think Dembs or Paulinho can feature as the deeper CMs together.  Maybe Poch gets them doing something that AVB didn't, but unless we really need to throw numbers forward, I don't see them starting together.  I see it as more offensive + more defensive (I'm using these terms as relative to each other, not the rest of the team).  I think Bentaleb, given proper instruction, could perform either job alright, but wouldn't be first pick.

Paulinho| Capoue
Bentaleb | Bentaleb
Holtby | 
Carroll |
