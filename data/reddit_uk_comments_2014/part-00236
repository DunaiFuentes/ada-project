The statistics are clear as day:

&gt;  187 (~51.5%) were civilians
&gt;  145 (~39.9%) were members of republican paramilitaries

while,

&gt;Of those killed by republican paramilitaries:

&gt;  1080 (~52%) were members of the British security forces

and

&gt; Of those killed by loyalist paramilitaries:

&gt;  868 (~85.4%) were civilians
&gt;  41 (~4%) were members of republican paramilitaries

Of the three main players in the conflict, Republicans (i) killed a lower percentage of civilians than either of the Loyalist paramilitaries or British state forces, and (ii) killed a lower number of civilians that Loyalist paramilitaries.

Basically, OP shouldn't be discussing this conflict with anyone, because he clearly has an agenda that he wants to ram down other people's throats when he himself has a very limited understanding of the history of the conflict.

true,merge111,null,null,"If we assume that our transfer business is over after we bring in a striker, how would you like to see our team a year from now?

1. GK. Starting at the back, I think we need a backup GK (I remember we were looking at Shay Given last season - someone like that would be great) but I do rate Mignolet as number 1 for now. We'll see how he gets on this season.

2. RB. Assuming Johnson continues to play at his level, I'd like to release him and have Manquillo and Flanagan for depth here. We can always bring in McLaughlin as well if we have injuries, I'd like to see him blooded into the squad next season actually. An experienced signing here would be a mistake IMO, as it would block the development of our 3 young RB's.

3. CB. Would like our options after next summer to be Lovren, Sakho, Skrtel, Ilori, Wisdom. Real quality first team with good youth backing them up. Maybe one of Ilori/Wisdom to go out on loan but I'm really pleased with what we have at CB now and for the future. Sell Kelly, Agger and Toure.

4. LB should be left alone for next season. Moreno with Enrique as backup. Sell Robinson.

5. CM. Options of Gerrard (only plays half the games now), Henderson, Can and Allen. Don't think we need any more depth here. I think we're quite strong. 4 solid players for 2 positions.

6. AM. Options of Coutinho, Lallana, Sterling, Luis Alberto (back from loan), Suso, Teixiera. Assuming Lallana performs, I don't think we need first team players, however our youth could definitely be better. I don't think (Hoping I'm proved wrong) that any of Alberto, Suso or Teixiera have what it takes to make it here. I'd like to see 2 of these 3 shipped out, keeping the best one and bring in a new promising player for this position. So next season we'd have Coutinho, Lallana, Sterling, Suso, New Signing.

7. Wide Options. Sterling, Markovic, Lallana, Ibe. I'd like to see another wide forward of first team quality brought in. If Ibe doesn't go out on loan this season, he will do next so we need another quality player here.

8. ST. Sturridge, Lambert, Borini, (Eto'o). Sell Borini, buy a top, top quality striker. (Maybe this player can be the same as the one that plays wide). Sturridge needs competition and personally I'd actually like a Striker better than Sturridge, someone who can unlock a defence by himself (^like ^Suarez ^*sigh*).

Summary: I think our squad is nearly complete. We just need to add a backup GK, youth AM, first team wide forward, first team striker. And then on top of this we need to keep signing the next big things to go into our academy. Looking at us I'm pretty confident for the future.

What signings do you guys think we'll need in the future?

Priority 2: CB. We're a Terry injury away from an incoherent defense. We need either someone who can displace Cahill or Terry this season, or be ready next season to replace Terry. Varane is ideal, but a pipedream.  Not a lot of options on the market, I wish we just kept Kalas and used him as a serious rotation option. 

Priority 3: DM. To really take the squad to perfection, we need another special midfielder. ATM we have options beyond Matic and Fabregas, but they're not at the level of the best squads. I'm thinking Pogba, Vidal, or Khedira...would've said Martinez if he didn't just tear his acl. 

How to make it work: Money was never an issue this window, we had a budget of over 100 mil pounds but made a profit anyways. We can afford to break the British transfer record (Torres) twice and still comply with FFP. Furthermore, we'd make a bit more in sales. Sell Cech, Ramires or Mikel (like them both, can't choose), and Torres (not for free, look for at least 10 mil). Say we get Cavani, Pogba, and Varane. 3 foreign players out, 2 in with 1 homegrown. We play 4-3-3

Given that, its easy to see why wealthier people from good schools and families are more often going to university and doing well there. Splitting of the tasks of getting there.

Sure, there's a dedicated and gifted proportion of kids from rougher or harder up families, with parents who don't know the ins and outs of uni and that world, or who've gone to schools with teachers who are out of their depth or don't give a shit, who will manage to focus on excelling at their studies and learning how to fill in their applications exactly how the universities want them, and prepping for their interviews well. And doing all the extra applications etc that Oxbridge require, and getting the money together to travel to the obligatory interviews. But that's tough shit, and if no-one's advising you how to do it right, there's more chance you're not gonna succeed. Take it from me, personal experience on this one.

Sure, everyone works hard to get into university.

true,BREsubstanceVITY,null,null,"Well...

Saying that we're cutting costs shows you have no idea how businesses and budgets work. If you did, you'd realize that from a spending point of view, we're spending more money than we ever have in the past, not counting last year which was extraordinary from a revenue standpoint because of the sale of Bale (which was almost totally reinvested in players).

Your failure to understand how difficult it is to build a new stadium in the middle of London is another point. A new stadium not only costs hundreds of millions (£ or $, doesn't matter) and requires lots of political influence over the Tottenham neighborhood as well as the City of London, overall. The fact that Levy has been able to accomplish this in only 13 years is actually rather astounding. He wouldn't have wanted to fund it entirely through loans because that is a bad idea from the financial standpoint of running a business (like higher interest rates) and from the fact that Premier League success, and therefore money (revenue), is not guaranteed. Spending hundreds of millions of £ on a new stadium is extremely risky when relegation is a possibility. But Levy has been smart to stash away plenty of money as a down payment on the stadium to reduce the amount of money we have to borrow, and ultimately, pay in interest.

Hoping to compete with the bigger teams is completely unrealistic and ignores not only how the manner in which some of those teams have catapulted to success, but also the long-term history of Spurs. We simply don't have the same ability to spend money as they do. Even Liverpool is able to spend more money than we can, largely because of their significantly higher stadium revenue. Your point about managers is fair, but I think it was equal parts bad luck also.

Bottom line - We just can't spend the same amount of money as the clubs around us, on transfers or wages. You simply must accept this as a fan of the club. Clubs in the recent past have overspent and gone completely bankrupt, Leeds and Portsmouth are two examples and Leeds had experienced much better recent success than we have. It can and does happen and Levy realizes this. Instead of blowing all of the money on huge transfers and overspending on wages, he's done this in a more deliberate, calculated, and sustainable manner. Every single year the club has grown in value. They are making all the investments behind the scenes to create lasting success. The training ground, the recent success of the youth team, the new stadium. Those are all huge investments to the infrastructure and revenue generating areas where we are behind the top clubs. But we're growing every year and that's the key.

This bullshit about Levy being greedy and pulling the money makes no sense. He has far more to lose if the value of the club declines than he has to gain by pulling money out of the club every season for short-sighted profit and he's not doing that. We aren't Chelsea and Man City who have oil daddies. We're not Liverpool or United who have massive historical and recent success. If we can be compared to anyone, it's actually Arsenal, who have also built their club very sustainably. 

So if you're not a fan of Tottenham because it's got the best atmosphere of any club, or because we want to play attractive entertaining football first and foremost, or because you just really fucking hate Arsenal then maybe you should pick a different club. If/when we do get to the top then it will be that much sweeter because we did it the right way, without spending loads of money that we didn't have.

It's like....It hasn't occurred to anyone before  really, the clinton administration that an idea of capitalism and social responsibility don't *necessarily* have to be at odds with each other - in fact, in all the discussions I've had the people who've railed against my ideas of a social welfare system have been staunch republicans. Believe me, there were more than a couple of heated discussions around my ex wife's family table during thanksgiving, who are the *epitome* of a texan family.

I did ask them what they were so afraid of though, and why they were so opposed to the idea of social housing and an American model of the NHS, and the response would often come that it would deprive people within the insurance industry the opportunity to make money, doctors the chance to prosper, pharmaceutical companies obligated to sell their wares at ""bargain basement"" prices such as $40 in India, but only be available to the US citizen for any price upward of a couple of hundred.That it would only in the long run cost the American taxpayer *more*, meaning that it would be nothing but a cash drain that would make everyone miserable.

I found it incredible that while America does indeed have systems such as medicaid, the amount of people who are ineligible, and can ill afford anything from dental treatment to something as simple as spectacles is alarming; I asked myself if this was *really* the country that declares to the world to give them our poor, our weak, our huddled masses? Was *this* the American dream? To *truly* separate the haves from the have nots? To me, as a Briton, it was lunacy. Utterly unimaginable that a country that prides itself on brotherhood and loyalty can live in such a way, and all because (it least to me) it boils down to fundamentally believing the propaganda of Communism and Socialism being ""evil"".

The easiest way to do that is not to help you find a job suitable for you but to make it as miserable and annoying as possible so that you stop. Before I got a job they began to get me in weekly and then wanted me to come daily. Pawning off jobs totally unsuitable that were too far away or very underpaid (i've worked those jobs before but I think I have done my time and would like to use my degree).

I did have one decent advisor during my time there, of course he has left now, but most of them don't care and just try to hit their targets. Thankfully it's easy enough to jump through the hoops, frankly you can easily fake it too which I did for a couple weeks when I just started to sign on as I wanted a gap between uni and work, didn't want 3 months off so I did start looking after and at least I got something in the end, even if it isn't permanent.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The occupation of Ireland was as primitive as the time it happened. The Irish were violently oppressed for centuries as a result. Saying ""that's how the world was"" is an explanation, but not a justification nor an excuse for the actions.

Cromwell was an utterly callous bastard, who ruthlessly asserted his dominance over everyone, but he had special hatred for the Irish. That other ""hero of freedom"", William Wilberforce, fought to end the slave trade *at the same time* as fighting to keep the Irish oppressed.

The entire history of occupation is shameful to the British, especially the Great Famine (aka the Potato Famine).

After the centuries of abuse which Ireland has suffered, the whole of Ireland should have been made independent at the same time, in my view; the partition did nothing but create tension. It made political capital for those who did it, and they made sure that the Protestants were put into a majority - where they were bound to continue the oppression of the Catholics, which they promptly did.

The discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland - both official and unofficial - led *directly* to the formation of the PIRA, who I would had supported wholeheartedly when they were first formed. I'd probably have joined if I were a young Catholic man in NI at the time; but I hope I would have left when civilians and children became targets for violence.

So, to get to your question: Bloody Sunday and Internment (which you didn't mention) were both crimes against humanity, and I'd like to see those who ordered, approved, committed, allowed, or later covered-up those acts to be committed to be brought to justice. 

That includes any government officials or politicians who were involved. or who had knowledge of the events. I'm sure that we never got to know the full story, there.

In summary: crimes against humanity are crimes against humanity; whether they are committed by the IRA, the UDA, the British government or military, or anyone else. I condemn them all equally.

The reason I asked the question that I did on this thread is because one doesn't really hear denials about Loyalist crimes, or the crimes of the British and the British Army. You don't get many people saying: ""ah, well, you see, the UDA targeted just the other terrorists and economic targets"" or ""the British Army, to be fair, thought all those civilians were carrying heavy weaponry and fired in self defence.""

However, one will quite often hear denials from people about the IRA (especially where there are large numbers of Americans, such as here on reddit); so that is the one to address, in my view. If people were denying things about the Loyalists or the British Army, I'd be just as keen to point out the truth of the matter there.

The casualty doctors and nurses are only vaguely aware of how to go about charging. It's not their job. It's not interesting. The charging system doesn't work on a per patient basis (why would it?). You'd need an accountant to work out how much it actually cost. What is the actual price? By going to to the ER, the net loss to the NHS would have been a cotton wool bud and a pair of gloves.

To me it seems complete and utter bullshit that Edinburgh Napier did better - the majority of people on my course complained to the university about how badly it was run. Alumni I talked to indicated that they had also complained about these things, but that their complaints had not been addressed, much less fixed.

&gt;What services and treatments are free for everyone?

&gt;There are some situations where initial treatment is available free on the NHS to all overseas visitors. These include:

&gt;emergency treatment – this may be in an accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department, a walk-in centre or a GP surgery

&gt;treatment of certain infectious diseases, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs)

&gt;compulsory psychiatric treatment

&gt;treatment imposed by a court order

&gt;family planning services – this does not include maternity treatment or terminations of pregnancies

&gt;However, unless you're exempt from charges, you'll have to pay NHS charges if you're admitted to hospital (this includes high dependency units and other emergency treatment, such as operations) or referred to an outpatient clinic.

It's a 2 bed, 1400 for August, but the landlord was kind enough to stretch it to September as well - so 2 months for 1800.

Downside is that the October place we found got snapped up before we could take it so now we're going to be homeless from October - but at least we've got time to find somewhere now.

We might also switch up and look for 2 beds as one of my mates is considering moving in with his gf, which is apparently going to be easier as 3 beds are pretty rare (especially HMO) unless you're a student doing a student let.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Rics said that a typical first-time buyer in London is perceived to need a deposit of 22% to put down on a home, compared with a smaller deposit of 19% required at the start of 2014.

This is a telling figure.  It indicates the lack of confidence that the banks have in current property values.  Requiring the purchaser to put down a large deposit insulates the bank from any risk. Property prices can drop by any amount up to that percentage without exposing the bank to risk.

For example, say you buy [this one bedroom flat](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-31516725.html) in central London that's on the market for £1m (a figure picked only to make the maths easy - it's more realistic than £100k which might get you a parking space or a shed in London).  You have a deposit of £200k and mortgage of £800k. 

At some point the interest rates rise, mortgages become significantly more expensive and property prices fall.  You can't make the mortgage payments any more so the bank repossess your property and sell it.  However, the market has now dropped by 20% so the house is only worth £800k.  Tada!  The bank get all their money back and you lose your deposit.

Since the death penalty was abolished the homicide rate has approximately doubled

https://fullfact.org/blog/murder_rate_doubled_death_penalty_abolished-2924

&gt; Using the Home Office’s recorded crime statistics and population estimates from the Office for National Statistics, we can see that the homicide rate in 2009/10 was 11.2, compared to 6.3 in 1964, close to a doubling, if somewhat short.
&gt;
But a look at the time series data might suggest that at its peak in 2002, the homicide rate reached three times that of the mid-Sixties. So has the Restore Justice campaign underplayed the rise?
&gt;
&gt; Here, appearences can be deceptive. In 1998 the Home Office made a change to the way in which homicide was recorded by police, which had a significant impact upon the results produced.
&gt;
Whereas before 1998 multiple murders were considered as a single incident, afterwards each death was considered seperately. In 2002, the figures included the 173 murders committed by Harold Shipman, whereas if these had been committed in 1964, they would have only counted as one incident for the purposes of the Home Office statistics.
&gt;
Of course this could also mean that the difference between the most recent year from which there is data and 1964 might also be exaggerated. To do a true like-for-like compaison therefore we would need to limit the analysis to the years 1964-1997.
&gt;
However even within this timeframe it would appear that the homicide rate did indeed double. In 1997 the homicide rate stood at 14.1, still more than twice the 1964 level.
&gt;
But there are some factors that need to be considered here.
&gt;
&gt; In particular, it is worth noting that the homicide rate itself is not a static figure, and is frequently revised in response to developments in cases. The reported homicide rate totals the number of incidents initially treated as murder, manslaughter or infanticide by police when they begin investigations. However this can fall in subsequent months and years in response to new information (for example, as cases initially considered murder are revised to suicide).
&gt;
If we look specifically at cases still considered homicide at the end of the period (as the House of Commons Library did in 1999), then the change in the murder rate between 1967 (the earliest year for which data is available) and 1997 is more modest. In 1967 this rate stood at 7.3, and reached a peak of 12.8 in 1995, falling slightly to 12.4 in 1997. In this analysis therefore, the homicide rate did not quite double.
&gt;
The claim that the ‘murder rate’ has doubled since hanging was banned can therefore be backed up, given the right caveats. As with any complex subject however, there are a number of different ways in which the data can be interpreted, and whether or not the homicide rate quite doubled, it does not necessarily follow that there is a direct causal link between this and the abolition of capital punishment.

The best objection to the death penalty is that innocent people who have been wrongly convicted will die

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DrsVhzbLzU

However from a pragmatic point of view consider. Back when the death penalty was in use the UK executed very small numbers of people. About 11 per year from 1900 to 1964

http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hanging1.html#stats

If you look at the total homicides graph here

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9411649/Graphic-how-the-murder-rate-has-fallen.html

It went from 250 in 1960 to 550 now. So it's likely that more innocent people die as homicide victims than would have been wrongfully executed should the death penalty be reinstated.

Taiwan where I work now has the death penalty. It is very popular - the government tried to abolish it but backed down in the face of public opinion. In the UK the government abolished in spite of public opinion. Inside the EU all countries must abolish the death penalty regardless of public opinion. There is much less crime in Taiwan than the UK.

&gt; I'm afraid this is one of the ones which goes in the 'why an out of touch politician elite should do what is right rather than what the people want' column.

The out of touch elite don't live in areas where crime is a problem. I'm sure if you study the polls you'll find that the worse area you live the more crime you experience and the thus the more you support the death penalty and other 'tough on crime' policies. 

Age probably has something to do with it too. When you're young and idealistic the death penalty seems like a horrible thing. As you get older you realise everyone dies of something and in fact most people die pretty horrible deaths from some lingering disease. Put in those terms executing someone as painlessly as is possible to punish them for a crime doesn't actually seem like that bad an option. In fact I'd rather die by lethal injection than rot away from Alzheimers or Motor Neurone Disease. Or for that matter die after getting drafted to fight in WWIII.

Now you'll say 'what about the wrongly convicted people you'll kill when you reintroduce the death penalty'. Well like I say less innocent people died from being wrongfully executed than die now from the increased homicide rate. You could argue that states don't have the right to kill any innocent people. I don't really accept that is practical. E.g. in a war innocent people die on both sides. I don't think that means we can renounce war because that means other dictatorial states could simply walk in, take over, and set up a regime in which more innocent people will die than they would in the war we avoided ([more people died of democide in the 20th Century than war](https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM)).

The only constraint on policy is that you minimise the number of innocent people who die. ",0,1408004331,null,0,1408004634,0,cjpvhsg,t3_2dexm4,t1_cjpvhsg,t1_cjovjnc,null,1435229761,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

1. What happens after uni is down to your motivation 

2. Same thing again for if you don't go to uni immediately

3. University opens options, but it isn't going to let you walk into anything without a struggle nowadays.

3. Don't freak out if you go to university #2 instead of university #1 if it is still what you actually want to learn and has a path to what you want to do.

&gt;

&gt;__North Korea__ ( listen), officially the __Democratic People's Republic of Korea__ (__DPRK__; [Chosŏn'gŭl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul): 조선민주주의인민공화국; *Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk*), is a country in [East Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia), in the northern part of the [Korean Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula). The name Korea is derived from [Goryeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeo), a dynasty which ruled in the Middle Ages. The capital and largest city is [Pyongyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang). North Korea shares a land border with [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) to the north and north-west, along the [Amnok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalu_River) (Yalu) and [Tumen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumen_River) rivers. A small section of the Tumen River also forms North Korea's short border with [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) to the northeast.  The [Korean Demilitarized Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone) marks the boundary between North Korea and [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea). The legitimacy of this border is not accepted by either side, as both states claim to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula.

&gt;Korea was governed by the [Korean Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Empire) from the late 19th century until it was [annexed by the Empire of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule) in 1910. When [Japan surrendered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan) at the end of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) in 1945, Korea was [divided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Korea) into two occupied zones, with the north occupied by the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Civil_Authority) and the south by the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAMGIK). Negotiations on unification failed, and in 1948 two separate governments were formed: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in the south. The conflicting claims of sovereignty led to the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War) in 1950. An [armistice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement) in 1953 committed both to a cease-fire, but the two countries remain officially at war because a formal peace treaty was never signed.  Both states were accepted into the United Nations in 1991. 

&gt;Although the DPRK officially describes itself as a [*Juche* Korean-style socialist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche)  and [elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_North_Korea) are held, it is widely considered a [dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship) that has been described as [totalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarian) and [Stalinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinist)    with an elaborate [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) around the [Kim family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_dynasty_(North_Korea\)). The [Workers' Party of Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Korea), led by a member of the ruling family,  holds power in the state and leads the [Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Front_for_the_Reunification_of_the_Fatherland) of which all political officers are required to be a member.  *[Juche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche)*, an ideology of self-reliance initiated by the country's first [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_North_Korea), [Kim Il-sung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung), became the official state ideology, replacing [Marxism–Leninism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism), when the country adopted a new [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_North_Korea) in 1972.   In 2009, references to [Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) ([Chosŏn'gŭl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul): 공산주의) were removed from the country's [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_DPRK). 

&gt;The [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production) are owned by the state through [state-run enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-run_enterprise) and [collectivized farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_farming), and most services such as healthcare, education, housing and food production are state funded or subsidized.  In the 1990s North Korea suffered from a [famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_famine) and continues to struggle with food production. 

&gt;North Korea follows *[Songun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songun)*, or ""military-first"" policy in order to strengthen the country and its government.  It is the world's [most militarized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_troops) society, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve, and [paramilitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary) personnel. Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the 4th largest in the world, after China, the U.S., and India.  It is a [nuclear-weapons state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea_nuclear_weapons_program#Nuclear_weapons) and has an active [space program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Committee_of_Space_Technology).    As a result of its isolation, it is sometimes known as the ""[hermit kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit_kingdom)"".

* Eto'o also brings a lot of drama with him. No one should be bigger than the team and I'm not sure Eto'o would be ideal for our club.

* Naisy on the wing is just not good. I would rather give McAleny and Kennedy a run.

For £120 PA:

* Family worldwide travel insurance (~£50-£100 PA) only useful if you go abroad outside of Europe more than once per year (otherwise you can just buy single trip for ~£20)
* Phone insurance (~£80 PA per phone)
* Homestart breakdown cover (~£50-£100 usually depending on your negotiation skills)
* extended warranty cover (negligible benefit)
* ""identity protection"" (negligible cover)
* 3% AER on up to £2,500 (only useful if you hold a float of cash on account)
* Helpful call-centre staff on the insurances, as opposed to other package accounts

I think you also get some amount of fee-free overdraft, though I've never tested this. They also have a pretty decent all-round credit card, and reasonable savings rates on their ISAs and so on.

Downsides:

* Uncompetitive rate compared to other package accounts (Lloyds 5% up to £2,500, Nwide's own Flexdirect account pays 5% up to £2,500, Santander 3% up to £25,000)
* expensive overdraft if you use it
* minimum contract of a year
* some exclusions to insurances (e.g. warranty cover - the purchase must have been in your name, so gifts aren't covered)

I am ""Iamtherealdovahkiin"" (nerdalert) but I'm called Mymle. I am not from the UK (I hope you dob't mind?) but I do often order from UK or asian sites on ebay. I do that because some of the more expensive brands are cheaper in UK and have a waaaay better range than here. Since there's a difference in some of the products (US vs EU) and the range, I decided to join in this subreddit.
- important note: English isn't my mothertongue and I'm using the browser on my phone, so it'll seem even worse than it is. I'm sorry :)

The main problem with my skin is sensitivity, dehydrated and mild acne. I have tried taking care of my skin I was 11 and I'm 24 now - still with troubled skin :(
At summer my skin tend to get oily and dry at winter.

This is my routine at the moment:
AM
Either:
Nivea Micellar Water
Or:
Exuviance Gentle cleanse milk
Exuviance Gentle toner

With:
White or black konjaksponge
Exuviance daily fluid mosturizer spf 15 OR Avène Hydrance optimal creme spf 20

PM:
Exuviance Clarifying Cleanser 
Exuviance Clarifying Solution toner
Avène Cleanance K gelcreme
(Or the micellarwater if it gets tooo late)

One or twice a week I use a mask. Today I tried one from Paula's choice for oily skin.
I'm just using the products I have, because I can't buy new ones before next month. I'll 

Goal:
To get my skin in balance and make the acne's apperance as invisible as possible. Especially after 13 years of ""annoying and ugly-looking skin"" that would be so awesome.

Aaaaand I want to be a crazy dog lady, but I live in a small apartment and study atm, so that'll wait. (Also I need to convince my BF how awesome that would be.

I didn't get into what I wanted last year so took a year off and looked at universities not just in the UK but also in other countries. Eventually I settled on Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (A pretty big tech uni in the Netherlands). It's better than the Uni I wanted to go to last year but requires lower grades (Generally 2 Cs but I got in with a C and a D). It's also a really amazing city, the week i've been here has been amazing. It's actually much cheaper than the UK (Tuition fees is 2,000 Euro a year as opposed to 9,000 pounds a year).

The missile bodies themselves are drawn from a common pool of bodies that are built and maintained in the US whilst the warheads and the submarines are UK products.

As the Trident D5s in a RN sub approach the end of a service interval the boat will go to the US to swap out for freshly serviced or new ones fitted with UK warheads.

In US could impede the UK using Trident eventually by refusing us access to the maintenance facility - however this would take months or years to actually effect the capability of the nuclear deterrent and presumes we wouldn't be able to maintain them ourselves.

We had the same arrangement with Polaris and we got that deal after the US fucked us over by canceling Skybolt. Its basically in nuclear weapon terms the deal of the f*cking century.

More and more people have moved to London, more people work in London than ever before, but we've not built new houses, new transport infrastructure at the pace people have moved here.

We've had large amounts of migration, most of my friends in London come from elsewhere, hell I've only one friend who's born and bread, two people I know came from Cornwall etc.  In fact thinking about the group of people I work with, that I socialise at all with, I think far less than 10% were born or raised within 30 miles of London.  Yet here we all are, working here.

That's going to drive demand up.  What's shocking to see is how bad the rental yield returns are.  How people are happy to buy a flat that will have a 2% rental yield on it.  This isn't just because people are bullish on the property market, but because financing is so easy.  If you've got 60% LTV HSBC mailshot me about borrowing at 1.49%!  Wow, my savings make much better return than that.

This is because what is shocking to me, is not the house prices complete with speculative buying, foreign investors and the like, but that the rental market is being sustained.

This is because of all these 30k+ people happy to have a house share.  So you have all these people paying £800 a month plus to share a property.  This, with cheap rates (1.49%, to think a few years back I thought my 4.5% was good!), means people will pay a lot for the property.

I don't think we will see a drop in rental prices, even if the housing prices collapse.  Too many people will be swooping in when the rental yields get to 5% and above, unless borrowing is really difficult, in which case rents will still stay high.

The only fix we will have, is buy building more houses.  Some people have a terrible habbit of complaining that they are outbid by say £100k, but not complaining if it was £5k.  If there isn't enough housing, it doesn't matter that you can't afford it by half a million, there isn't enough.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","This is where treating everyone equally truly does become a dicey thing to do. Supposing a critical mass is achieved whereby they do become an established authority within the UK – what happens when things inevitably bubble over and clashes occur between Christian / Atheist / etc. people and them or – more accurately from the aggressive expansionist methodologies that they use – when *they* come to blows with *everyone else*. 

Do we just allow it? Allow the establishment of Shariah law in the UK? Ask that everyone else looks the other way when something nasty happens because it’s their right to carry out their own brands of justice and law? What if they try and carry out that justice and law on someone who has nothing to do with their beliefs and doesn’t want to? 

This shouldn’t even be a discussion. The idea of a United Kingdom that’s hard-line Christian and allows nothing else is bad enough – but an Islamic state? Fuck that. No thank you. I don’t want to live there and I shouldn’t have to endure it. 

If that’s so hard to swallow then imagine how I would be received if I went to Iraq (for example) and demanded to be allowed to establish my own beliefs / justice system and expected to be allowed to do it. Do you really think if the shoe was on the other foot that it would be tolerated and treated well? 

Islam is a growing problem. It’s proving to be far from a peaceful religion (although some practitioners are peaceful – that doesn’t mean that overall it’s compatible with the rest of the world). It shouldn’t be allowed to establish a state in the UK.

The fact is, courses operate within a market place, and the only reason that universities offer them is because there is a demand from students, although rarely the same demand from employers.

- I wouldn't say catholicism was a highland tradition, there were large numbers of protestant highlanders also. Such clans often fought against the Jacobites.

- My understanding is that highlanders evicted during the clearances did not shun the lowlands - quite the opposite. In fact in Glasgow, there is a bridge named the ""hielenman's [I.e.highlanders] umbrella"". This was because people who moved south would congregate underneath it after arriving in Glasgow. If you look a bit harder you may find hard numbers relating to evicted highlanders destinations.

- Yes, there certainly was disdain between the two (although perhaps 'disdain' would be too strong a word). For hundreds of years there had been a very distinct culture difference, of which the strongest manifestation would be the language difference. Most highlanders spoke gaelic, while lowlanders spoke 'scots' (very similar to english).

- There has never really been border areas between the two (and I've never heard any place described as such). Even so, Glasgow is out and out lowland, and I doubt it was ever culturally highland. This ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Highlands_lowlands.png/500px-Highlands_lowlands.png ) shows the boundary of the highlands.

This season is going to be a great one, if City can build on last year with a fully fit Aguero throughout the season, and Mangala and Kompany can get a good partnership going we can definitely take the title again and run deep into europe and the cups.


Chelsea are the main ones to look out for, with the signing of Costa and the second season of Mourinho they look to be scary title contenders, we have a deeper squad I feel than them, but they can win anything on their day.

Pelligrini has definitely done a good job instilling his tactics and calming the team down, but it seems we lack a 'fire' that some of the other big teams have some of the time. It will be up to us wether we can break the 'typical city' mould and really assert ourselves as title contenders.


Europe will be very interesting, I still think the game against Barca was alot closer than it seemed, and if our squad can build on what we had last year I see no reason why we can't go very deep in this.


**2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why?**

**JOVETIC** will be one to look out for, as an Arsenal fan would say ""he's a new signing, definitely looking scary in pre-season, we didn't get to see much of him last year, but when he came on he scored and he played well. He seems perfect for our play style now, and hopefully he can settle in well.

**ZUCULINI**, I know he's off to Sunderland, but he should come back in the second half of the season with the disappearance of Yaya and Lamps, looks scary good for a 21 year old, and definitely one to watch for the future

**AGUERO**, coming off his big first season injured, the little man will be looking to prove himself. Will probably miss the first few games with rest but should come back with the fire we know he has. Boasting one of the most incredible goals/game ratio and being one of the top strikers in world on his day is a terrifying prospect for anyone facing us.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"During stagnation what tends to happen is the market becomes paralyzed - people refuse to sell at a loss (even if that's the fair value). People prefer to hold onto an asset they don't want/need until they think they've made a profit.

That's why a bit of inflation in general is good for the economy, it allows breathing room for prices to change. Things are actually getting better in a way, rental yields are falling across the country so for a lot of people increasingly it's getting more advantageous to rent.

For example I am in the position to buy a house where I live, and have been looking, but the prices people want me to pay are very high.

So they won't accept a lower price, however they're happy to rent out at extremely affordable rates. Whilst a lot of people say their mortgage repayments are cheaper than their rent, for me it's the other way round. A mortgage would almost certainly be more expensive, as well as having to cover maintenance and ground rent.

As is my money is just in savings as I might need it if I buy, but I could just as easily start to put it in the stock market in an ISA wrapper (£15,000 a year now isn't it?) and over a few years I would have a bigger tax-free investment that many people's equity in their homes, which I could sell at any time if I needed the cash.

The only disadvantage is I'd still be paying rent, but thankfully there's next to no rent inflation (in six years local rent for my property has gone up from £575 to £600) because nobody can afford to pay more.

It’s hard to orchestrate my feelings without sounding racist / unaccepting / bigoted and that’s a problem I think a lot of otherwise (I hope) reasonable people are facing. 

I can’t speak for everyone but I grew up in the UK, it’s been my home country and now it feels like there’s a subtle division – this new ‘thing’ that’s popping up called Islam and it doesn’t like me. 

Perhaps that’s too much media propaganda or fear mongering. I’d like to believe that. But I live in Birmingham and sometimes I do get the odd dirty look from a complete stranger who I’ve had no other interaction with – but it’s typically the younger men from other ethnic backgrounds. 

I’m also crucially aware that the UK bends over backwards to avoid offending anyone. We hate doing it. Equality is a fine thing but what happens when you offer it to people who have come from a background that wants to change the way of life where they live (now the UK) to their own? That feels like giving such people the tools and the permission and the voice to destroy you way of life. 

Just a decade ago I didn’t know about Islamic states or Shariah law. Now I don’t *want* to know. It’s hard to see much good coming out of allowing such things to flourish. 

It’s usually rude to call other people’s beliefs medieval or backwards or negative – but a lot of these beliefs *are* medieval and I hope there’s a point where we as a nation say ‘no more of this. You’re welcome to settle here and to establish yourselves but these backwards beliefs – they have to go.’ 

I’d extend that to most religious beliefs but even Jehovah’s Witnesses have stopped door knocking and just stand on streets handing out pamphlets to those that want to find out more now.

I disagree entirely with your solution. The UK is a highly centralised state compared to most other nations, it is politically and economically focussed on London. Speaking as a Londoner I don't think this is in the nations benefit, whilst London generate huge surpluses for the rest of the country it also sucks up infrastructure spending that could be better deployed elsewhere. 

I think we should devolve both powers to the regions, as Labour attempted for the North of England and elected mayors as proposed by the conservatives. By having all the money, and therefore all the power, paid to London then distributed it weakens the regions and strengthens the treasury.

You might have heard about it - ours was the part of the country that was out of commission by rail for three months because the part of the line around Dawlish is about five feet from the edge of Britain, and got washed away in inclement weather....Which also flooded most of Somerset to boot.

Oh and to boot, DML keep downsizing. That's right. further downsizing. We've just had an incinerator built that *no one* aside from the local conservatives wanted which will earn the government a good amount of money while only benefiting the MoD, while potentially risking the city to possible carcinogens. Thanks environment agency! Thanks local government! And it gets bleaker! Land registry has operations down here but...They're talking about downzising, Orange/EE and 118 have call centres maintained down here, but are shutting down.

I wouldn't though - I'd see how severe the case was and would then judge. 

Here's a girl when - if you bump into her walking out of a corner shop and you just opened a big bag of honey roasted peanuts - would probably have a serious problem. From the writing of it it doesn't take much for her to have a serious reaction. 

Ban *her* from airlines? No. But if it's that likly that her life is at risk from being in the same general space as a bag of nuts a couple of metres away then I'd give serious thought about the wisdom of allowing her into that situation in the first place. 

The other passangers are *not* privy to her medical details. They shouldn't need to be. I'm not saying they should feel free to eat peanuts sitting right next to her just to prove a point - but nor should they be responsible for her safety.

There are many different opinions on this, good and bad;

Good points are, it gives you experience on a smaller bike and that you haven't jumped straight on a R1 or something. Also 47bhp, with a maximum of 95bhp, is a nice way to start and that little bit more than the old 33bhp. 

If you compare it to cars, yes you could pass your test and jump into a 4L car, but realistically, how many 17-21 year olds can afford something that big, and then even the insurance, (If you can find someone who will actually insure you). You can find a 1000cc bike and insure it a lot cheaper than you can a car. 

This being said, a motorbike is more dangerous, due to aspects such as, inexperience and unobservant riders + drivers.

The bad bits, are obviously the expense and the wait. 

In full answer to your question..

No you will not be able to ride any bike, after 2 years you will need to retake your mod1 and mod2, you do not need to retake your theory. These will be exactly the same as the ones you do for A2 but on a bigger bike.

As to the studies - studies itself aren't necessarily an indication to something being certainly correct. That is why it's often that a larger number of studies need to be done and only then the whole opinion may be changed as it eliminates possible mistakes or problems with actual studies.

Looking at [NHS-Eat less saturated fat](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Eat-less-saturated-fat.aspx) and [BHF-Fats explained](http://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/prevention/healthy-eating/fats-explained.aspx) we can read there is a clear guidance of eating less saturated fats. Although, BHF admits that one study suggested these may not be a problem, yet more research is required. Public generally isn't scientific and should base their opinion on interpretation of specialists, or ideally public health organisations like NHS and BHF.

So, yeah, since there is an indication that saturated fats don't necessarily have to be bad, it isn't an official opinion yet and our diets shouldn't change just because of such study.

The tl;dr for purposes of this point is that, no, ""Don't eat nuts"" is not a good way to convey a persuasive instruction. It can even serve to be counter-productive, as it primes the mind for thoughts about nuts, which can  actually stimulate a desire to eat them that wasn't previously there. A better way to convey the message really would've been to explain why the instruction was being given. It'd turn a ""Whut, why? Mmm, I've got nuts in my bag, what harm could it do?"" into ""Oh, fair enough"". It would ideally be followed up by periodic messages thanking everybody (specifically this - social persuasion is a powerful tool) for not eating nuts, and framing it as a favour to the crew and the girl. 

Conventional thinking might tell you that ""Don't do this"" sets a rule that people will obey, but, well, that's just not how people work.

true,cass210,,Gonnae no' mess up the testers?,"* MAC lipstick in Syrup.  Bought this on the Debenhams £10 lipstick deal.  I was concerned it would be too similar to the Revlon Balm Stain in Honey, but they are actually different enough IMO.  I love the colour, it is a fabulous mauve pink, a nice day lipstick.  Lustre finish, it is neither moisturising or drying, but it does have a glossy (but not overly glossy) look to it.

* MAC lipstick in Crosswires.  I never thought I would be able to wear coral pink as a cool toned lady, but this is fab-u-lous.  I was concerned when I first used it as it does start out life looking very orange on me, but as it dries it turns into the pink that people are familiar with.  Cremesheen finish.

* No7 BB Lips - I had read a user raving about these on this sub.  They sang their praises so highly that I decided to spend my No7 voucher on this, but so far it has been really disappointing.  I would say it is not as moisturising as, say, my Nivea lip butters and the colour isn't quite as pigmented as I hoped.  I get that it is supposed to be a BB for lips but I think it is a bit too sheer for me.  I also feel that the finish is patchy and it LOVES to settle outside my lipline and look messy!  Hopefully I can make this work...

* Naked Basics palette.  I like the eyeshadows but I am a little underwhelmed.  I'm not considering getting rid of it but it gets less love than it should from me.  In saying this though, I do think that it is a good palette for travelling if you don't want to take your whole collection with you, but it is *a little* boring for my everyday tastes.

Iodine pills were kept in a big bright red box in the school nurses office but really they were only useful in the event of a small scale accident or release of radiation - not in the event of a warhead detonating, which would turn a sizable part of the western half of the city into a smoking glass crater.

As it is, I sincerely doubt the current plan as it is laid out in that article for a couple of reasons.

1) The current nuclear warhead maintenance base (RNAD Coulport) is only 5km (if that) from HMNB Faslane. You want those things as close to people on your side with guns as you possibly can. 

The distance between HMNB Devonport and the Fal estuary is 80km away.

2) Plymouth already has a lot of infrastructure dedicated to naval armaments. [About ten years ago the navy wasted £25m on building a new rearmament jetty at Devonport](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/3743688.stm) with a capability of rearming subs with nuclear weapons.

There is also a vast (but disused) naval ammunition store built into the hillside a scant 2km from HMNB Devonport - RNAD Bull Point. Bull Point still appears on the National Asset Register as recently as 2007. 

Theres also another depot a short distance away, RNAD Ernesettle.

I think a title chase, but I can't see us winning it. Chelsea are too strong and have rather than just piled on to their strengths, looked at where they fail. 

2.

Eliaqium Mangala - Big, strong and quick but seemingly not there mentally. Will he partner with Kompany allowing City to boast an athletic partnership of steel, or will he just nod off and be a 32m flop?

Jovetic - City have a lithe striker who can create chances and actually mean it (I'm looking at you Dzeko). Looked on the pace in pre-season and must've spent the entire world cup period injecting horse placenta, crystal therapy and magic moondust into his knees because he even looks fit. 

Samir Nasri - Little breach from what others are gonna say but I think Samir's early retirement from internationals shows he's tired of the drama in his life and is going to get his head in the game. He looked promising last season but still has something to prove to a lot who see a lazy drifter.

But we are kidding ourselves if we think Islam is a nice religion, or something which is compatible with the UK and our values. I really dislike it as a religion, and I think most of their rules are stupid or just plain damaging.

This country supports equality for men and women. Islam recommends female circumcision, and their culture practices a shitload of forced/coerced marriages which particularly penalises women.

This country supports multiculturalism and tolerance. Islam (or associated Pakistani-region culture) forbids marrying non-muslims. For any immigration, that makes a huge difference in how well you integrate with the native population. Look at Polish people. They have been quickly accepted because they are similar to us - they drink beer, and they bring over sexy people who will bang you, marry you and have kids with you.

Plus I tend to find that Muslims care more about their religion than anything else. Islam has the highest adherence rate of any religion (i.e. you are born to Muslim parents, so you stay Muslims, practice it, follow it and raise your kids as Muslim.) It's scary how many doctors, dentists and other professionals devotedly follow their crazy beliefs.

Personally I find the dramatic rise in their numbers quite alarming. Either the religion needs to change and tone down, or we need to start properly worrying about it.",0,1408020475,null,0,false,0,cjpz0x9,t3_2divua,t1_cjpz0x9,t1_cjpx4w6,null,1435231507,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

&gt;&gt;*""Penn Station"" redirects here. For other uses, see [Pennsylvania Station (disambiguation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Station_(disambiguation\))*

&gt;__Pennsylvania Station__ (normally abbreviated __Penn Station__) is a name applied by the [Pennsylvania Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad) (PRR) to several of its grand [passenger terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station). In the early 20th century different railroad companies typically used different stations, especially in major cities or towns, so the station usually took the name of the company. (If various railroads combined to use the same depot, the place often took the name [Union station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_station).)

Whilst in discussion on a web forum I got speaking to some young Muslims and I was struck as to just how similar in terms of absolutism and hard line views they held and how similar they were to the Far Right groups.

At first I tried really hard to put it down to the reactionary views of the young etc.

But then I found organisations like [5pillarz](http://www.5pillarz.com/) who claim to be a un-biased source of Islamic views and news When I went to their Facebook page (90,000 Likes) my jaw dropped as to just how far disconnected so may of them are/were from 'mainstream' thought.

So many Muslims from all different sects and from all over the UK with ISIS flags as their profile pics, praising the establishment of the Kaliphate, genuinely believing ISIS are CIA and Mossad funded. Shocking anti-Semitism, glorification of appalling violence the list goes on and on.

Please don't take my word for it go and see it for yourself.

I'm a die-hard Leftie, born and bred to immigrant parents on a rough council estate in Central London and even growing up in the mid-70's and 80's with BM, NF, IRA, Footie Firms etc I have never experienced such genuine nihilistic and profound seething hatred for the 'kafir'

And before you pile in with the inevitable 'just a minority, ""not representative of moderate Muslims"" I urge you to check out some of the profile and professions. I've counted teachers, council workers, office workers, restaurant owners, mechanics, civil servants, housewives, school kids and University students.

That's the fundamental problem. Islam is still succeeding as a proselytizing religion, but as a framework for running nations, it has quite comprehensively failed for the last couple of centuries. It's being kept alive on life support in a few countries due to them having the fortune to control huge oil deposits, but in terms of meeting the needs of their people, even these states struggle. The only Muslim states without oil wealth that are currently doing well are the most westernized (e.g. Turkey).

However many Muslims are still not able to come to terms with the fact that their religion is not the best social system for running a country. This contradiction, which is essentially a psychological problem within Islam, is the root cause of Islamic fundamentalism, and is the reason why many of the most militant (such as Bin Laden), come from wealthy backgrounds with extensive exposure to Western ideas.

Fundamentalism may present itself as a conflict between the West and Islam, but it is in fact an internal conflict within Islam, between the Islam of the past, and any attempt to fix these countries so they can operate in the modern world.

As such, the only way that fundamentalism can possibly be defeated is for the fundamentalists to gain power, and then for the people to see for themselves what an abject failure an attempt to create a medieval Khaliphate in the modern world will become.",0,1408022529,null,0,false,0,cjpzqvq,t3_2divua,t1_cjpzqvq,t3_2divua,null,1435231835,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

6th is about what i think we should finish on paper, just behind United and just ahead of Everton.

true,theanonymousthing,logo,,"QUESTION 1.

This season is going to be extraordinarily tight with practically all the teams looking the strongest they've been in a long time. In fact i cant remember the last time i've seen so many teams with legitimate title aspirations and the capabilities to pull it off. Honestly speaking i think our main competitor will be Chelsea and i can see it going down to the wire with them. The optimist in me says we'll win the league as we have the team to do it, the realist in me says chelsea are just too strong and we'll come 2nd. Nothing is predetermined in football though, especially in the premier league.

QUESTION 2.

**Eliaqium Mangala**- The obvious choice. A lot of different reports on the price city paid with the figures ranging from £32M-£42M, either way we obviously dropped a lot of money and hopefully he'll live up to the sum. Eliaqium has everything he needs to succeed in Manuel pellegrini's system of a high defensive line with Speed, Strength and all round athleticism as well as great tackling technique and workrate. He can only learn and grow with a partner like Kompany.

**Fernando**- Our other ex-Porto man. He was an absolute rock for porto, completely dominating their midfield and acting as a fantastic defensive screen. I hope he can replicate his fantastic form for Porto at Manchester City. Again he is another player that suits our system as with the heavy emphasis on attack it inevitably leaves gaps which where often exploited by teams on the counter (see liverpool and chelsea). Fernando offers a much more disciplined defensive role than Fernandinho with both likely fighting for the spot next to yaya. He has shown flashes of his porto form in pre-season but hasn't been up to the level he is used to though that is to be expected in pre-season.

**Jovetic**-After suffering injury after injury which kept him out for most of last season Jovetic looks set to do big things if his few appearances last season and his pre-season form are anything to go by. He managed to bag 6 goals from his limited starts last season and looks hungry and determined to make his mark with the skill to carry it out. All in all if Jovetic stays fit, expect something big.

QUESTION 3.

what i think we will adopt for most games: 

http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=42j31

In Big games, such as against Barcelona and Bayern in the CL, we sacrificed a striker for a midfield to have a 5 man midfield:

http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=42jy0

You might be surprised to see Milner in there, but Pellegrini puts him in big games as such because of his massive work rate and more importantly his defensive contributions. He retains possession and dispossess well as well as his strength make him a solid choice for those nervy matches. Also Clichy is another change, he too is favoured in big games because of the better defensive game he brings over Kolarov.

true,mr-strange,null,null,"Really? Here's an example of how this works from my own personal experience:

My wife was very ill, and needed urgent medical care. We phoned *NHS Direct*, and they suggested a nearby primary care centre, who could provide triage and pass us on to a hospital if necessary. I drove my wife to the PCC. I stopped at the drop-off point and accompanied her inside. I gave my car keys to my friend, who drove the car round to their car park. My wife was immediately seen by a doctor, who called an ambulance for her (thanks NHS).

Now unbeknownst to me, the PCC had a system where visitors needed to key their registration number into a computer terminal, in order to identify their car as legitimately parked. I never even saw the car park, we spent no time in the waiting room (where the terminal was located), and in any case, I was giving my wife all my attention. My friend who parked the car rarely drives, and failed to see the signs. He also never came inside to where the computer terminal was.

So a few weeks later, I got a £100 ""fine"" from some parking vampires. I completed their bullshit ""appeal"" process, describing what happened, and they decided that I still owed them £100. I complained to the PCC, who washed their hands of the whole thing too.

General advice at the time was to ignore these demands for payment. I did ignore them, and they gave up on me. I suspect some human eventually looked at my case and decided that they wouldn't stand a chance in Hell of winning in court.

These parking companies are simply extortionists, whose business is frightening vulnerable people into paying them money. Their former business plan (clamping, followed by extortion) has been made a *criminal offence* - but they've just shifted their tactics, not changed their spots.

At Barca he has mainly played DM with the intention of disrupting/destroying the opps play and has been very average overall. I watch every Barca game and am yet to see any evidence of his 'great range of passing'. He usually plays it simple and short and lets Barca's technicians take over. 

Seeing as Barca have the two best DM's in world football in their squad it's probably the wrong club for Song to ply his trade. 

Thinking on it more I wouldn't be averse to us signing him as another physical DM but our priority has to be for a striker first, maybe a backup GK second and if any cash is left over then maybe we could look at a guy like Song...maybe on loan?",0,1408024299,null,0,false,0,cjq0g9n,t3_2dityg,t1_cjq0g9n,t1_cjpyhx4,null,1435232169,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Spend all the money you can on the helmet, you will find the sharp rating site and excellent resource. Sharp are a UK government funded independent rating (they test each helmet to destruction). The gold sticker is worthless these days, don't trust it, use the Sharp rating.
http://sharp.direct.gov.uk/testhelmetlist?order=field_price_value&amp;sort=asc&amp;sharp-make=All&amp;sharp-model=&amp;sharp-type=All&amp;sharp-rating=5

Gloves:
Lighter water proof gloves can be used all year round. You can always get some cheap inner gloves to keep them toasty when it gets cold.

Boots:
Whatever sturdy boots you have, need to be waterproof.

All in, expect to spend around £150 + if you buy wisely and second hand, except the helmet obviously which should be new. Spend at least half your total budget on the lid. Make sure you have one that fits well and has a great sharp rating.

It certainly was quite a distressing change of tone compared to Grey's previously chipper and upbeat approach to subjects. We shouldn't assume that he was the first to make this case. People have been presenting the evidence and trends of his video, almost point by point, on-and-off for years. The only difference change is that he's taken the time to collect the most contemporary stock-footage of experimental machines. 

I do not believe that machines are the problem. Machines are the purest form of demonstrating humanity's capacity to master the environment and tame the world to it's will. The problem is the economic system where corporations, although comprised of men and women all thinking only of trying to do a good job and feel accomplished like the rest of us, behave like mindless despots that hack and slash at costs wherever it can for the brief gratification of share holders. Its impossible to even say who these stockholders are, and if they too are feeling the pinch of their own gambling with stocks, mostly because they seem to only exist whilst riding the wake of the wisp of the incorporeal hand of the free market. 

There was an excellent documentary about the subject, which was called *The Corporation*. The release date was a while back, but the points made are just as valid as today. If there was going to be a dialogue about planning the future of mankind, then it should have happened decades ago, whilst the industrial pace hadn't spurned a population in over-extending itself.

""TAW: As you’ve hinted at, there is some question over Lallana’s stamina – he was substituted a lot – should we be worried?
BEN: Let’s just say this – I wasn’t surprised to hear that he is injured already! I genuinely can’t remember the last time that he completed a 90 minutes for Saints. He has had problems with his knees and ankles for several years and often got replaced at Saints around the 70-75 minute mark – and this wasn’t because he had been charging up and down the pitch all match.
I wouldn’t say he is an Andy Carroll or Darren Anderton ‘sicknote’ type of player at all, but he is fragile and that’s why, with the hefty price tag and hectic fixture list, I’m interested to see how much he does achieve at Anfield.""

I'm undecided. But a lot of these more extreme views come pretty close to, if no openly advocating violent overthrow of the government and British Civil institutions.

Johansen really isnt good enough for a DM role, leave that to Biton, you seen it in Warsaw that we didnt have any spine in the midfield, thats down to not having any ball winners or people who will bounce of players (Like Wanyama did) Biton is stronger and his defensive abilities are better in my opinion, I like Biton think he is a good fit, his form near the end of last season was incredible, Johansen should play higher up, more of a CM role that lennon had him in.

But I do know that the gesture by Anelka in support of Dieudonné upset quite a bit of the Jewish community, especially in France. Here's some more info:

From the [Wikipedia article about the quenelle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenelle_(gesture):

The **quenelle** (French pronunciation: ​[kə.nɛl]) is a gesture created and popularized by French political activist and comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala, popularly known by his first name. Dieudonné first used the quenelle gesture in 2005 in his sketch entitled ""1905"" about French secularism, and has used it since in a wide variety of contexts.

Jewish leaders, anti-racism groups and public officials—especially in France—have interpreted it as an inverted Nazi salute (illegal to perform in France) and as an expression of antisemitism. French officials have sought to ban the gesture due to its perceived subtext of antisemitism.

**Antisemitic interpretation**

Following the quenelle made by French soldiers stationed outside a synagogue in the sixteenth arrondissement of Paris, The president of the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism wrote an open letter to Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, dated September 9, 2013, in which he describes the gesture as ""an inverted Nazi salute representing the sodomy of the victims of the Holocaust."" He also appears in the French TV show ""Complèment D'enquête"" making the same claims. Dieudonné and his lawyers filed a lawsuit against the League in December 13, 2013.

Dieudonné describes himself as an anti-Zionist, but not an antisemite. He has stated that the quenelle is a humorous ""anti-system"" gesture which has no association with antisemitism, and declared that he will sue various journalists and personalities who compared the quenelle to a Nazi salute. Officially, French authorities have said the gesture is too vague to take any action against Dieudonné. However, an official January 2014 circular issued by the Interior Ministry specifically linked the *quenelle* gesture to antisemitism and extremism.",0,1408026256,null,0,1408026485,0,cjq1biw,t3_2djdqd,t1_cjq1biw,t1_cjq15aw,null,1435232751,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

Support for ISIS in Iraq stems almost entirely from the de-Baathification process we used to remove the old government.

Entirely our fault, some form of violent armed response was guaranteed. We should have known better, we have ample experience in the consequences of banning large groups of people from politics e.g. the IRA. 

As for Iraq not being stable in the first place, that is also entirely our fault.

Fair comment, but it's evidently not. I've had friends with food allergies before, the worst result being a dodgy stomach / vomiting. I’ve known that a nut allergy sufferer *eating* nuts can be a serious issue but not breathing in particles through re-filtered air. 

I don’t feel particularly stupid for not knowing this. The only reason someone *would* know this is if they have had exposure to a story like this or known someone with such a serious allergy etc. I don’t know how to deal properly with snake bites either – it’s not something I’ve ever needed to know. 

&gt; Then again, a lot of people seem to float through life in their own blissful little bubbles...

Why are you starting to get condescending? Are you an expert on all medical matters? Your folly is assuming something like this is common knowledge when it’s really something you’d only pick up via a number of channels like so much information from ‘how fracking works’ to ‘how to fly a plane in an emergency’. 

Assuming everyone knows specialist knowledge – particularly about specific allergies or your own medical issues – is a mistake people should not make.

true,[deleted],null,null,"How do you know he's creating the problems?  Just because he's a reactionary defender doesn't mean he's reacting to his own mistakes and not the mistakes of others.  If you guys haven't noticed we are the most attacking team in the league and commit the most players forward.  Our central midfield is a bit lacking in pace and our fullbacks spend more time in the other teams half of the field than our own.  

How do you know he plays too deep?  Do you coach the Liverpool's back line?  Maybe Rodgers wants him to play deep so he can provide cover against the countless counter attacks other teams have against us.  He's a sweeper.  He makes the last ditch tackles when everyone else has been beaten.  

Sakho arguably made just as many mistakes in much fewer minutes on the pitch.  He has a big future but he is by no means this commanding dominate CB people make him out to be.  

Lastly, OG's is a horrible reason to discount a defender.  Carragher should have never played for us if that's how you rate your defenders.  The majority of OG's aren't really the fault of the defender and Skrtl more than made up for it with his goals against the opposition.

true,Samson_Uppercut,num26,,"Basically, they've expressly supported someone who has been convicted on multiple occasions of making defamatory anti-Semitic comments, that's what they're ""guilty"" of. See below:

Basically, the comedian who popularized the quenelle [Dieudonné M'bala M'bala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieudonn%C3%A9_M%27bala_M%27bala), has long been known for his far-right views and has been convicted and fined for numerous anti-Semitic comments (check the Court Actions section of his wikipedia page, linked above).

While the player's themselves haven't ""done"" anything anti-Semitic outside of the gesture, some of them, Anelka for sure, have explicitly stated that they did it as a show of support for their friend, Dieudonné"". [Anelka tweeted](https://twitter.com/anelkaofficiel/status/417002216306663424): ""This gesture was just a special dedication to my comedian friend, Dieudonne."" 

Furthermore, Anelka has since been pictured wearing the [same shirt](http://www.lemeilleurdupsg.com/images/news/image/anciens/anelka-tshirt-quenelle.jpg) as [Dieudonne](http://allainjules.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dieudonnc3a9.png?w=500&amp;h=316). And pictured [making the gesture with him.](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/01/article-2532121-1A59260200000578-302_634x498.jpg)

To draw an American analogy, this would be like an athlete claiming support for Rick Perry, who has [this ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PAJNntoRgA) up, with the immortal quote of: “*I’m not ashamed to admit that I’m a Christian, but you don’t need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there’s something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can’t openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.*” 

Then the athlete saying that they themselves aren't bigoted or anti-gay, despite their open support for someone who is.

In conclusion, no one (individual or group) gets to decide whether or not a particular action is offensive. The people offended do, in this case, Jews. And despite the fact that numerous Jewish leaders have openly called for support for this to stop, some people (cough, Anelka) continue on blathering about how it's an ""anti-establishment"" symbol, not a religious one. A decision that is out of his hands.

**tl;dr: Bigotry, and support of it, is bad.** ***Always.***

&gt;

&gt;__Dieudonné M'bala M'bala__ (born 11 February 1966), generally known by his stage name __Dieudonné__ (French: [djø.dɔ.ne]), is a [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people) [comedian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian), actor, and [political activist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_activist). His father is from [Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon) and his mother is French. Some of his performances and associations have been controversial and he has been convicted for [antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism).

&gt;Dieudonné initially achieved success with a Jewish comedian, [Élie Semoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Semoun), humorously exploiting racial stereotypes. He campaigned against [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism) and was a candidate in the 1997 and 2001 legislative elections in [Dreux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreux) against the [National Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(France\)), the French far-right political party that he perceived as racist.   On 1 December 2003, Dieudonné performed a sketch on a TV show about an [Israeli settler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement) whom he depicted as a [Nazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi). Some critics argued that he had ""crossed the limits of antisemitism"" and several organizations sued him for incitement to racial hatred. Dieudonné refused to apologize and denounced [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism) and the [Jewish lobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_lobby). 

&gt;Dieudonné approached [Jean-Marie Le Pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Marie_Le_Pen), leader of the National Front political party that he had fought earlier, and the men became political allies and friends.  [Holocaust denier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denier) [Robert Faurisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Faurisson) appeared in one of his shows in 2008.   Dieudonné described Holocaust remembrance as ""memorial pornography"".  Dieudonné was convicted in court eight times on [antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism) charges.   Dieudonné subsequently found himself with increasing frequency banned from mainstream media, and many of his shows were cancelled by local authorities.       Active on the internet and in his Paris theater, Dieudonné has continued to have a following.  His [quenelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenelle_(gesture\)) signature gesture became notorious in 2013, particularly after [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) [Nicolas Anelka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Anelka) used the gesture during a match in December 2013.

Maybe its just the sort of people that go into comedy? I don't know who said it but it was said that behind every good comedian lies a tough childhood, maybe the stereotypical right winger (good rearing, good family, good job and so on) just doesn't go into comedy or have a background where they become funny? Maybe because most comedians are left wing that right wing ones don't fit in or hide or change their views to fit in? Perhaps even because of their views they wont find work?

Its an interesting question and I reckon that there are many reasons behind it as with everything in life its complex.

&gt; I don't think investing a huge sum to potentially get 25 goals a season off a 27 year old is a wise thing to do. I do not want that - which is why I'm 'acting' like that.

Any transfer you do is a gamble. Dejan Lovren might break his leg. Emre Can might break his arm. Markovic might lose all his pace. Adam Lallana might may forget what a dribble looks like. 
It's worth the gamble if Cavani can score boatloads. Maybe you think we're gonna pull a Mourinho every game. Maybe you have a plan.

Whatever the fuck that means.

I suggest you unbunch your panties. That's all. 

&gt; Numbers aren't everything. Don't think that studying stats and playing Champ Manager make you a fucking expert, lad. They don't.

Yeah, I mean who needs goals? Right? Also, 'lad' I can barely type on this hunk of a machine, let alone games. Idiots like you are why the term superfan exists.

Given what sensibilities we have in our society, people praise honest earnings for honest work. Its why everybody hates those that make a living entirely off market speculation and directors of powerful companies too big to fall.

If resources were evenly distributed amongst the whole of society, then recollected and reallocated on an annual basis (for example), then hard workers will be forcefully removed from their property, and that property will be given to the infirm, the unwilling worker, the delusional poet vagabond. We have a minor version of this already with the benefit cheat scapegoats, but the difference is that for the time being, everybody can still make a conventional living and profit from it, perception of excessive taxation aside.

true,alcoholly1985,null,null,"I have just had my final results for my course at the age of 28. I know you've said that you're going back in September, and it's great if you decide to do this - good luck - but as someone that was in a similar position I just thought I'd share my experience.

I took a year out after college (at the age of 19), went to uni, got ill and came home within 3 months. 2 years later I tried again, went to the same uni, same course, hated it and left after a year, moving back home in the process. I then worked for a major mobile phone network in the retail sector, where I gained an NVQ Level 3. I soon realised that I wasn't going to progress, so I looked at local universities and found a course I thought looked great so I applied. I got in because of my experience outside of education, so do note that this is favourably looked upon by unis.

Socially I never really had a problem being 7 years older than most of the students (there were none of the same age as myself, and a couple over 40). Indeed, I think being a bit older helped as I have more confidence in myself and very often fulfil the 'big sister' role within the group, which helps us bonding-wise. I never went on nights out, as I too commuted from home, but I did make an effort to go on all the trips the university put on which definitely made a difference. Also, on these trips I did go out, did the bar crawls etc. and made sure I was friendly and chatty. I did stay away from the competitive edge some of the younger students have (""don't tell her what you've put in your essay!"" etc.) as I am of the slightly more mature opinion that it's not a competition, we're all there to learn, and sometimes you'll need some help too. Sharing experiences and knowledge is a good thing, as long as you're not being taken advantage of.

If you're not happy with your course, consider why and what effect that will have on you. If it's poor teaching, that's probably not going to change. If it's that you don't enjoy the course, why not? Have you lost interest? Did you think it would be different? You may still have a chance to change to a similar course within the university you are currently attending which had the similar modules for the first year but different choices for the second. You need to be aware that you cannot get funding for more than 4 years of university, so if you think you're going to be in a position next year where you really can't hack it any more, then you need to get out now, or start saving. A whole new course would only be covered for 2 years. What are you studying? What's your end career goal? You may not know yet, and that's fine. I didn't either! But you want to be on a course that not only interests you, but will also help you get to where you want to go.

On the mature student note, I recently attended an education conference where they had a talk about graduate employment and the shocking fact that only 27% of companies hire fresh graduates for higher positions. They say that this is due to their apparent lack of experience. They way I see it, I'm way more employable now because I managed to squeeze all of that in before I got my degree. Employers would also be impressed by your drive and initiative, as well as your ambition to succeed in a field you want, not what a college has told you you're good at.

I'm a full believer in going to university later. Studies have proved that the students are more driven, more committed and generally do better overall. Since I've returned, 2 of my older friends have too and both are doing extremely well.

Be positive, but also remember that this is your decision and may impact your future in both the long- and short-term. If you decide to stay on, then I really wish you all the best, and other comments regarding societies is a great idea. Perhaps also consider joining the Student Forum as a Rep? I did this and it's a great way to get your views heard. If there is any chance that you will continue to have these doubts and possibly abandon your course, then you need to look at other options. With the prices the way they are, you may not be able to fund yourself through a year of university easily (although I obviously don't know your financial situation, please don't be offended!).

* I think I just randomly read that the Highlanders shunned the Lowlands and thus mainly settled Nova Scotia, but I imagine it may have had more to do with the economic depression in that region at the time as well.

* My main interest in Glasgow comes from the fact that I am descended from Stewarts and Todds in Lanarkshire. Apparently some of the Stewarts 'self-exiled' following Culloden in anger and thus emigrated to Canada (by their account). Family members have asked before about things like a family tartan, but to my understanding it seems that if there is any, it was probably adopted by Stewarts who remained in the Lowlands in the 'trendy' Scottish stuff stage, as it was not a tradition for Lowlanders previously, and would therefore be a little dubious. Also, it seemed strange to me that Lowlanders would be Jacobites when I understood it less, but I know now that they did exist.

* I am also curious about the disdain as I have family on one side who were from Lanarkshire and on another from Orkney and Shetland. I was curious as to whether there might be mutual disdain between the families.

* I mostly ask about border areas because of what I said above about tartans and other such traditions 'sticking' with the family despite being from the Glasgow region. Is it possible that any clan or tartan talk from Lowlanders could be anything more than just an affectation? Were there Lowlanders who did do these things, or was it totally unheard of?

Key player for me: Bent. Until Kozak and Benteke get back (and if they actually find form), he will be our most reliable source for goals. Weimann scores when he wants to, but he never seems to have the urge.

Yeah wanting your club not buy world class players is supporting. Right. 

&gt; No, you're right armchair. Let's spunk £60m on a 27 year old with a patchy last couple of seasons and pay him £120-200k a week on a 5-year contract because he makes you go all flushed and is a 'superstar'.

No, purely because you're assuming he makes us flush. One slip, one vital goal and one block of world class level will make a difference.

Pakistan did not want this, India did not want this, the rest of the world did not want this, and the world encouraged both sides to end the conflict because of this. 

If nuclear weapons had not been an issue, the conflict would have gone on much longer, and many more people would have died. 

Nuclear weapons were absolutely a deterrent in this conflict. There is a lot of bad blood between Pakistan and India, and If it was not for them both having nukes, there would be a lot more conflict between them.

I've always believed that being a self starter and having on-the-job experience was more important for being employed but I'm glad to see you can kinda confirm that!


I enjoy the subject I'm doing (it's kind of what I did for two years before doing my BA, so I know it's the right career for me &amp; I have some good experience) just unfortunately not the course itself. Ultimately I think it comes down to bad/lazy teaching - I have two tutors who I feel are good and care about my work but they don't actually teach me, they're just tutors who I go to for advice and critique. The majority of the lectures I went to last year were purely taken from google. Most of the stuff we covered was incredibly basic, not at all what I expected on a BA course. I'm studying an arts course and critique is important for improvement - but it is nigh on impossible to get critique out of my tutors and when I do, it's useless. The other issue I have is that the majority of the other students on my course are really disinterested. There's about five of us who regularly turn up to our classes and produce work on time but the rest (about 30) either don't turn up or produce work the night before. I know it shouldn't matter what my course mates are doing but it really does on an arts course - for the course to be worthwhile we need to be having lively critiques but that doesn't happen or when it does, we waste time critiquing something that was produced half an hour before class. 


I know people have said that first year is kind of a crap-shoot because they don't expect you to be able to do anything but I'm genuinely worried that the course won't improve significantly enough to be worth £9000 a year. I am pretty hard on myself anyway, I've started up a critiquing class at uni already to improve upon the situation we currently have, and I got a first this year and managed to get myself two internships over the summer so it's not like I need my degree to push me to do those things or to get where I want to be. However, I am still worried that i'm not learning or improving as much as I could be if I was on a better course with people more like myself. 


I'm not too worried about getting to where I want to be after uni as I'm aiming to go freelance rather than get a graduate position. However, I want to graduate with the best possible skills that I can get and I'm worried my course isn't helping me with that at all.


The reason I've decided to stay put kind of sucks but it's difficult. Last year me and my boyfriend bought a flat together (I know, terrible idea) and he has a good job in our current city so moving to another city so I can go to uni is somewhat difficult. We would have to sell our flat, rent somewhere in our new city and he would have to be able to get a new job (not too hard, he's a web developer so in high demand) but I'm just really nervous about such a huge undertaking.

if you don't know the difference between world class and overpriced this conversation is pointless. 

If Cavani was £25-30m? Maybe worth a shout. £50-60+? At 27? Huge difference. 

&gt;One slip, one vital goal and one block of world class level will make a difference. 

It's proportional. If he scored the goal to win us the league it would be great, but a £200m investment needs to do more to justify the huge outlay. I know it's easy come, easy go to you, but the club needs to spend sensibly to survive. We nearly went under recently, or don't you remember that?

2. I like Kagawa, he always seems to get himself in good positions and makes himself open for a pass. I don't think he was utilised well by Moyles either and will likely struggle this season for games with Mata taking ownership of the creative midfield role in VG's 3-4-1-2 system; which is a shame but understandable. Would be great if you moved to a christmas tree formation with Kagawa and Mata behind Rooney or VP, but you would be asking a lot from your midfield two.
3. Transfer activity has been good. We've managed to get rid of our spanish contingent who seemed to cause problems in the dressing room and brought in a top striker, speedy winger, and Gylfi who was great for us on loan previously. Need a little enforcement in defence but news is Napoli's Fernandez should be announced shortly. Another RB would be nice too. On the United front, Herrera. I only saw him play once this preseason but he looks to be the player you've needed for a while. 
4. VG sure acts the part, but I think your (possible) success this season will be better explained by moving Rooney to a forward position instead of a deeper role, giving Mata more freedom and the introduction of Herrera. I do think its possible you could be the Liverpool of this year, conceding goals but winning solely by scoring more.
5. Either United run away with it and win by a couple like the start of last season, or something like a 1-1 draw. I think we can sneak a win if we play the right way, but you looked good in preseason and if Monk insists on 4-2-2-2 we could struggle.",0,1408032435,null,0,false,0,cjq4h4q,t3_2djgqi,t1_cjq4h4q,t3_2djgqi,null,1435234258,3,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,3

Going back at 26 was great though. Don't see yourself as different to other students no matter how old you are, so many mature students set themselves apart from the rest of the student population. They avoid Freshers' Week and everything else. Find at least one society or sports club of like minded people, there will be one and even with a family try to make the effort to get involved where you can. Find out if there's any support for student parents that you can get involved in too. Student Unions have got a lot better at recognising that student parents need more than just a cheap bar (though who doesn't like  cheap bar?)

I've personally made it known that I'm not a huge fan of him, mostly because I thought he was unambitious and seemed to have a ""fuck all"" attitude toward supporters who pay massive amounts of money and would bleed for this club. I also think he's too proud to admit when he's made a mistake (Forest last year, throwing all the eggs into the Carroll basket).

I do think, however, that a lot of the undue criticism is related to the comfort and safety of the internet. People can say whatever they want on the internet without repercussion. They can throw decency and common sense out of the window, and worse yet, they can incite unrest if they are even semi-clever at turning a phrase.

Sam has done what has been asked of him. And he's done it under extreme scrutiny while being undermined by a superbly unprofessional and immature owner (Sullivan). When I listen to Sam, it's pretty obvious that he's painfully aware of the criticism, but more importantly that it won't make him change what he wants to do in order to make the club succeed. In that way, pragmatism and a SPINE can be a good thing.

We'll see how this season plays out. Now that it's upon us, I'm throwing my support behind the club again... until we lose 5 in a row, of course. Then you may again hear me calling for heads to roll.

The Stewarts are in fact a 'real' Scottish highland clan. The were so powerful that they gave rise to the Royal house of stewart, who ruled Scotland and eventually England for hundreds of years. The tartan may well be invented, but they certainly  were a large clan, with many different septs. If you look on wikipedia you'll find out lots more, but as you'll discover their history is extremely complicated.

As to your family's relation to the clan, I have no idea. My understanding is that it's tempting for people to imagine that people who share the same clan name are all related etc.  This is more of a myth, that was deliberately spread by clan chiefs. In such a society, where a clan is effectively a fighting force commanded by its chief, convincing everyone on your side that you're all related inspires loyalty. Nonetheless, many tenants who worked on the chief's land would adopt their surname. If they moved elsewhere to someone else's land, there's a good chance they would adopt a different surname.

This is basically a roundabout way of saying that the fact you share a family name with a famous clan doesn't mean that you're distantly related to some clan chieftain. The dynamics of Highland/lowland clans were very complicated, and changed throughout the years. You're right to be sceptical of the 'tartan shortbread' view of Scottish history, but the truth of the story is much more interesting.

This post pretty much reaches the end of my knowledge about Highland clanship (again, I'm willing to be corrected on anything). If you want to learn more, there is a Scottish publishing company called 'Birlinn' who publish lots of Scottish history books. I would highly recommend 'The Hunt for Rob Roy'. Although not directly related to your enquiries, it gives a good feel for the nature of Scottish clans. Other books I'd recommend would be 'The highland clearances' by Eric Richards and Samuel Johnson's tour of the highlands and hebrides.",0,1408033188,null,0,false,0,cjq4vp3,t3_2dg2w5,t1_cjq4vp3,t1_cjq35mv,null,1435234478,2,false,ScottishHistory,t5_2u68p,2

Nope. Our leaders are bigging up the ""ideological"" aspect of it but it's largely bullshit. This is an ethnic conflict, not an ideological religious one. In every single nation where they operate e.g. Libya, Syria and Iraq there are clear ethnic divides across the battle lines. 

&gt; We are not to blame for that.

Actually, we are pretty much to blame for the entire mess. 

Racialist Islam largely stems from the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia where [we empowered them with guns and protection as they were one of the few groups in the region perfectly happy with killing other Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabi_movement#Alliance_with_the_House_of_Ibn_Saud). That suited our interests greatly in defeating the Ottoman Empire during WW1, see the Arab Revolt for more info. Basically the exact same thing that we recently did in Libya but 100 years ago. 

In all likelihood the entire fundamentalist movement would not exist today if not for our decades of support as a means to keep the arab world under our thumb. We supported and empowered the worst possible people to maintain our empire. At worst it would be like the Westbro Baptist Church if not for the decades of guns and cash from us. And they still enjoy our support today, Saudi Arabia is one of our closest allies despite being the principle financier of Islamic terrorism. 

Our opposition to ISIS has absolutely nothing to do with their extremist ideology. We've given support to the exact same fighters fighting the exact same way for the exact same goals in both Libya and Syria yet now we suddenly have a problem with them as they attack our own interests in Iraq?

4. *The Rings of Akhaten*
5. *Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS*
6. *The Name of the Doctor*
7. *The Day of the Doctor*
8. *The Time of the Doctor*

WARNING: You **will** have most of the Eleventh Doctor's arc spoiled going this route - River Song in *Name*, and basically everything else in *Time*. I can suggest the following ""abbreviated arc"" order to avoid these spoilers. Most of Series 3 and 4 don't really matter for this. As such, I'll leave them for you to experience on your own.

Here's all of Eleven's arc-related stories, plus the Series 3 and 4 episodes required to understand them - two-part stories are listed together:

**Series 3**

- *Blink*

**Series 4**

- *Silence in the Library* / *Forest of the Dead*

**Series 5**

1. *The Eleventh Hour*
2. *The Time of Angels* / *Flesh and Stone*
3. *The Hungry Earth* / *Cold Blood* (potentially skippable, but I wouldn't)
4. *The Pandorica Opens* / *The Big Bang*

**Series 6**

1. *The Impossible Astronaut* / *Day of the Moon*
2. *The Rebel Flesh* / *The Almost People* (potentially skippable, but I wouldn't)
3. *A Good Man Goes to War* / *Let's Kill Hiter*
4. *The Wedding of River Song*

The hold up seems to be tied to his third party ownership, specifically Villareal negotiating to buy out the % owned by River Plate as opposed to the other portion owned by a consortium (which seems to primarily be Mussachio's agent/agency).

I think that is why we saw the story this week about Villareal offering Mussachio a improved deal, it puts pressure on River Plate.  If Mussachio signs an improved deal 2 of the 3 owners of Mussachio still benefit in a manner while the third gets nothing.....Villareal benefit by keeping their best player, the Consortium (Mussachio's agent) benefit by the player being on higher wages (traditionally agents get a % of wages, higher wages = more money)....River Plate get nothing.  It was a shot across the bow to rattle River Plate (who have said they want the money from the sale).

In the end it seems like Mussachio wants to move, the agent wants him to move, Villareal are already bringing in his replacement (they just brought in Ruiz on loan) and everyone is just waiting on River Plate/Villareal to sort out their bickering over who gets what in terms of ownership %.

Sounds like you've completely changed your perspective.

&gt;you took the words completely out of context in an attempt to make them look worse. 

Luckily I linked directly to them so there wouldn't be any doubt.

&gt;There was no need for me to mention segregation because it was implied.

Looking at your post history I seriously doubt that.

&gt;The fact that you're going that far back is quite astonishing.

My Grand Canyon comparison was meant only as a comparison of natural beauty (for me, a body isn't improved by by adding images or text any more than the Grand Canyon would be)  so the graffiti comment isn't really relevant, since I wasn't addressing whether such a thing should be allowed or whether it would be right to do it.  

Not sure why you feel the need to answer my comment with  ""My body is my body and I can do with it what I wish"" when I took great pains to point out I was merely sharing my view on tattoos and in no way saying people shouldn't get them and love them if they want.

Similarly, find a welsh pronunciation guide and try to memorise it, unless you're already Welsh. Nobody really speaks the language, but lots of people will live in the Hendrefoelan student village opposite Olchfa school, and you might need to get a bus into Llanelli on your way to Rhossili or get a taxi to the shops at Fforest-fach. Despite outnumbering the Welsh students by a solid ten to one, English people get constantly mocked for making a complete cock up of every sentence involving locations.

Do you know where you're living yet? I recommend the village, but it's a nightmare getting into university every day on the bus. Lots of people cycle, I rode a motorbike which let me beat the traffic but it wasn't exactly convenient. It's a very nice place to live though, lots of open spaces to doss about on, and there are some good woods within walking distance. Campus rooms seemed a bit dingier from what I saw, but then you're closer to town, the beach, the park, and of course you're *in* the university. Wherever you end up living, keep your door open for the first week and get chatting to people. If possible, make a good set of friends from another flat early on too (know anyone else going to Swansea?) so that if you end up living with insufferable bellends you've at least got somewhere to go once in a while. There are shops on campus and in the village, but small ones and very expensive. Befriend someone with a car or be ready to take the bus to the big Tesco in town. I don't know where you're coming from but Swansea's bus system is generally pretty good. If you're a Londoner, don't try and use your Oyster card on one though, I saw that happen more than once.

I can't think of anything else Swansea specific and no doubt you've already read a bunch of uni top tip articles online.

Addressing some of your concerns here, the first year is easier and on some courses ridiculously so. This should not however (as you have noticed) mean that students aren't expected or allowed to not try their hardest. The fact that the course suffers from low attendance points to an issue with the policy within the university. I know when I first started uni we had no real restrictions on how often we had to turn up. They changed this in the second year, with a '3 strikes and you're out' system. It sounds harsh, but it worked. Consider going to a senior tutor with evidence to support the theory that better attendance results in better grades (it does). Evidence:
http://rer.sagepub.com/content/80/2/272.short 
  http://cemapre.iseg.ulisboa.pt/events/1e3/papers/Martin%20Ryan.pdf
  http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07924360120043621#.U-zlj_ldWPI
  (For more just search for 'Correlation between attendance and grades university' on Google Scholar). I'm a big believer in 'Don't go with a problem, go with a solution to the problem' and take this evidence to someone with the authority to put these things in place. If you're going above tutors heads, then so be it. You've tried and they weren't willing to listen. You are paying for their services and as such deserve a level of teaching that you are happy with (side note: by taking my 'solution' to a tutor I have been asked to work as a part-time lower level lecturer next year, they do listen if you have a well thought out argument). The right tutor will be aware that lower grades can affect their league table position and also their student satisfaction rates, both of which do not look good on the university and possibly (don't quote me on this, I'm not 100% sure) damage their funding. I wouldn't recommend just taking this to a tutor after a lecture, make an appointment to see them in their office so they really take notice and aren't rushed.

With the lectures via Google issue, make notes of questions to ask throughout the lecture, if you don't already. There is always a certain amount of self-directed learning expected throughout any course and this will only get higher as you continue. This means you need to get as much info out of the lectures you can so you can add to it later. I know you probably already do this, but look at other angles you can take. Is the lecture put online beforehand (which may also answer the attendance problems)? If so, look through and write some questions down then. Or look at your course guide and see if the objectives are being met - if not, ask.

Your setting up of Critique Class is really fantastic! Spot on with that. Perhaps look at other Art Clubs either in the uni or free ones locally. Not only a good way to meet people, but also an opportunity to show your work and get other opinions. This may sound like a lot of extra work, but it's never too early to get networking, especially if you're looking to freelance once you've finished.

Regarding the question of worrying about whether your course gets better, maybe you should get in touch with some of the 3rd years on your course? See what they have to say? I don't know if you have one already, but at my uni we have a facebook group for the course with all current students and also an alumni page. If you haven't got one, set it up - it takes 2 minutes and is a really good way of getting feedback, organising meet-ups, and getting advice on your work.

With the trouble you'll have moving, I agree that it may not be the best option for you. What you do need to do then, is act. Always remember that you pay a large amount to be taught and the university should recognise that. Are there other universities close to you that you could commute to? Some colleges offer HNDs in Art, with only the third year being done at a uni, although I agree that you may be better to just stick it out. OU also do Art &amp; Design courses (not sure how that's related to your course) and would probably count your pre-existing credits, although I'm not certain how the whole need for critique would fit in.

It does sound like a huge undertaking, moving somewhere new and upheaving everything and you do need to be sure before you do it. I don't know if any of my suggestions help, but if they do, and you haven't tried them already, think about their viability. By pushing, you may well get the degree you deserve!",0,1408036300,null,0,false,0,cjq6m48,t3_2d2f82,t1_cjq6m48,t1_cjq48yh,null,1435235206,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Anyway, the whole point of 'whatabout

&gt;They've nothing to do with each other. 

If only the world were so black and white.

&gt;ISIS are not a sovereign state, they are a (powerful) militia based on religious fundamentalism.

Hamas is different to that how exactly?

&gt;Protesting against them is an irrelevancy. 

Calling for action however, is not.

&gt;ISIS do not fit in that criteria, they are not a government, they are not a state, the have no formal diplomatic relations with the rest of the world.

On 6 December 1995, Patrick Tate, Craig Rolfe and Tony Tucker, three drug dealers well known to the police, were lured to Workhouse Lane, Rettendon on the pretext of a lucrative drug deal. There they were killed by shotgun blasts to the head while sitting in their Range Rover. The bodies were found the following morning.

Two men, Jack Whomes and Michael Steele, were convicted of the murders after police informer Darren Nicholls gave evidence against his former friends at their Old Bailey trial. They have always protested their innocence.

There are three other movies based on the Rettendon Range Rover murders: 2007's Rise of the Footsoldier, 2010's Bonded by Blood and the 2013 straight-to-video The Fall of the Essex Boys.

Anyway, back to your question: yes. But that's not taken as a presumption just from that fact that he's got the number 6 shirt. More that he's very, very intelligent for his age on the ball and has looked just as good as some of the other first team players on the pitch the few times he's managed to get a game for the last 2 years. He'll continue to develop and I really think he could be a major asset in the next few seasons. I mean, he's only 19 at the moment but he's pushing himself into a Chelsea side which has a reputation of not incorporating a huge amount of academy players.

I really enjoy toying with stats but my knowledge is fairly limited. The NBA thing was based on very basic calculations, it was more about putting it together so that it actually means something. 

Also there is a world of difference in stats between NBA and football. It's picked up in recent years with Opta and WhoScored, but it's still very rough and largely not available to us (the general public)

That's why the work I've done on football has been limited to reliable and available stats: goals, assists and minutes :

* [2013: A year in Goals](http://i.imgur.com/JzSCKNz.png)

* [Frank Lampard's Premier League career in charts](http://imgur.com/a/NmsNi)

* [Minutes/goal Ratio for the 2012/2013 Premierleague](http://i.imgur.com/ypHazoy.png) 

I'm also fairly critical of the use of ""advanced"" stats in football (like WhoScored's ratings).

Sorry for ranting ill get to my question... I know that i am not gonna get into a ""great uni"". How much does the Uni i got to effect my job prospects afterwards? Is it worth going to a uni what isn't that great? 

Also if i have a really good personal statement, will they perhaps lower the grade requirements (does this ever happen) 

When I apply for ucas should i go for uni's what are BBB/BBA what i ""might"" get the grades for i i do decent on my retakes, or go for unis what require BCC what is more realistic for me to get?

Nadia Hussain Mua As you are already aware WhatsApp was brought by Facebook in February 2014 for 19 Billion dollars.
Facebook and Instagram are owned by Mark Zuckerberg who is a open donor and supporter of Zionist Israel. He has blatantly donated billions to Israel who are inhumanely killing our Palestinian brothers and sisters. Please note Jeff Rothschild is the Vice President of Infrastructure software and thus also a share holder in Facebook.
There are other non Zionist apps such as the Telegram Messaging App. It's available on both android and apple users created by two brothers in Berlin. It's better encrypted, much safer and thus better than WhatsApp. Never forget WhatsApp is Zionist backed so all we do and say is monitored and can leave us vulnerable to be exploited later. Also as we continue to stay members of these sites and apps we're directly supporting Zionist companies. This is an opportunity to further boycott Israel sponsors and Mark Zuckerberg has been very generous to them. Facebook has donated way more money than the other companies like Tesco, McDonalds who we are already boycotting.
Can we all install telegram please and use that instead.

""Barclays Premier League matches are not televised in the UK between the hours of 3pm and 5pm on a Saturday primarily in order to protect match attendances and atmosphere.""

You get more premier league matches on television and legal stream in the United States than they do in England.

Also its not entitlement at all.  This is what a football club and community is, or should be, all about. Once again you can look to the bundesliga to see how much a season ticket is there compared to the premier league.  Its obviously possible, and the Germans are obviously competitive in Europe, the league and clubs are just greedy.

That stuff will be what sells you to an employer, just having a degree from anywhere doesn't get you a guaranteed job. You want to go work for Google, they will want to see a degree but then they'll test your skills and that's what will decide if you get a job. Big employers are shifting more and more to skills based recruitment not big name uni recruitment.

That said, it can make a difference but based on an employers personal prejudice more than anything. Some employers think the Russell Group is useless and doesn't produce students with vocational skills, others thank the Russell Group is the be all and end all. The latter is probably more common but if an employer only wants you based on the logo on your degree certificate I'd wonder if they're someone you want to work for. Uni is a great time when you will have more time on your hands than ever before or since. Use it wisely.

It's also important to note that degrees vary massively within any institution, some are generally considered excellent, others not so much.

You should have a mix on your UCAS form, you have 5 choices, one should be a uni you like and will almost certainly get into. One should be your dream uni that you think you might just get the grades for. The other three should be a range somewhere in between. Importantly they should all be places you have researched and believe you would be happy to study.

What's the mean salary got to do with anything? 

&gt; so we can attract the ""great minds"" from business world and trust-fund types? 

If that was the actual aim we'd be paying them far more.  The majority of people who would probably make excellent governors of large complex government departments are probably already doing similar for 6 figure salaries in large successful companies.   No-one even semi-capable in London would go into politics for the money... 

Just because there are some twonks elected in some areas doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the pay scale.  Less than stellar MPs indicate a problem with the election process and party politics.  It's not fixed by introducing low pay completely detached from the role's responsibly. 

&gt; MP's salary is far above that of the average person and certainly better than the vast majority of public sector

And GPs (up to 83k) are paid far more than nurses.  Nevermind hospital consultants (73k to 135k) who are still public sector workers.    You're argument claims the quality and performance of all these jobs would improve if we lowered their salary 20-30k because then only _caring_ people would be attracted to the job.  Of course that's nonsense - it's more complex than that.   But so is governing and especially the processes and demands of being in charge of government departments / select committees etc. 

&gt;We won't and shouldn't attract people with pay... This is one ' job ' that is a vocation and i don't think I want someone repersenting me because ahh sure the money is good. 

The money isn't good! In terms of how important the job is it's _ok_.  And the people we actually want to attract already earn far more.   I don't think private sector salaries should drive MP and ministers salaries - I think it simply ought to reflect responsibility, and the rarity of the skill.  But _cutting_ it doesn't achieve or reflect any of that.

Your suggestions were definitely helpful (: Although I have tried a lot of them already, any that I haven't I'll give another shot to when my course starts back up! I just feel like I've pushed all year to get them to care about my course but whenever I take a problem to them and I'm like 'I don't think i'm getting the most out of the course' or anything else they're just like 'Oh well you're doing better than we expect and you're a good student so stop worrying, everyone feels this way!'. The only person who has even remotely tried to make stuff better this year is one of the technicians but I'm kind of aware that there's only so much they can do for me. 


I think the problem I'm having specifically with the course and the uni overall is that nobody seems to care about anything so even escalating stuff doesn't work. They seem to be purely interested in getting people in the door. They're highly rated for the 'student experience' so I think they spend more time encouraging that than actually worrying about the other stuff. I had a complaint this year with financing which I escalated up the ladder multiple times and multiple members of staff never even responded to my complaint. My classmates have had the same issues. 
Attendance has the same issue that it just doesn't seem to be enforced. I'm assuming that when I go back in September there are going to be quite a few people no longer in my year or on the course at all, but if this continues next year I will take those links you've given me and I will take it above my tutors and send them to every member of faculty!


With regards to lectures, they're kinda.. haphazard at best! They don't always stick to the timetable so it's quite easy to miss a lecture or just have the lecturer not turn up. They don't post the lectures online at all and there are no hand outs (except in one lecture where I get a shit tonne of really terrible print outs from websites!) and there aren't really any opportunities to ask questions, it's more just like 'Here's some info and that's that!' but to be fair, lectures aren't massively important on arts courses, critiques and classes are more vital for improving our work. I make a point to stick around after every class to try and ask questions but it can be a bit of a crapshoot as to whether or not you can get anything from them!
Thankfully I've made some connections out of uni this summer from my internships so I'm hopeful I can rely on some of those connections to help me out with more critique. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to give me some suggestions, I do really appreciate it and i'm definitely gonna keep pushing to get the degree I want!",0,1408040968,null,0,false,0,cjq9bhh,t3_2d2f82,t1_cjq9bhh,t1_cjq6m48,null,1435236429,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

-An obvious title defence is on the cards, and I know it's cliche but I really do feel like it'll be down to the wire again with the title not decided on the final game. Champions league is still a bit ambitious maybe, but I would hope for at least quarter finals this year. A group win now that we have better seeding would go a long way for us.


United and Liverpool will do a polarity switch. VG and the new signings plus the lack of European football means that their focus is on regaining some dignity and they are a threat. Liverpool may have tightened their defence but with no Suarez they will drop off the radar.


For me it is between City and a pretty frightening Chelsea. The one thing they lacked was that bit of oomph up front and with Costa and Drogba to do that I'd be worried. 


Arsenal will come fourth. United third. Can't comment about a winner.

Now consider that over 18 league games and we get £28,523,880 with the £35 tickets and £34,228,656 with the £42. That's a ~£5.7 mil difference with just £7 per ticket. Those are just the cheap tickets as well. 

Point is these companies make money off fans spending. If Liverpool has gotten to the point where they sell out the stadium every game, then they are losing money because ticket prices can be higher. This sucks for low income fans but from the companies stand point why sell a ticket to a person for £35 when another is will to pay £42 for it.

Spoke out against tesco getting free workers.. and stuff that MAKES SENSE. UKip could be crippled as soon as they highlight UKip's tax policy. Farage would not be able to survive that barrage. 

If the tories addressed the EU for what it is, a precursor to a federal Europe meaning us losing our standard of living, governance of our own people, military, and everything else that goes along with that... if the tories said HERES A FUCKING EU REFERENDUM, BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION BECAUSE WE ARE FOR YOU AS THE PEOPLE. 

I'd seriously consider the tories over UKip. As it stands, I vote UKip every single chance I get local and national and European levels. 

It's about time somebody really spoke for the working class, and the middle class and implemented a level of fairness that really emulated 'strivers and skivers', whilst genuinely protecting people who cannot work.. and those who have mental issues, giving them all the backing they need to get from the bad place they're in and into the workforce, for the long term in suitable jobs that leave them better off. 

We've become a nation who cannot address things, thinks in ideological undertones and have things we can't talk about, such as immigration because that is bad to talk about. 

Politicians who have only ever been employed in politics using every tactic in the book to remain in a nice light in public opinion, and with that saying nothing they can be attacked on by the general public.. something that UKip aren't and can be attacked due to this will have NO EFFECT WHAT SO EVER, because a single speech can go viral at any time during this era of modern communication. 

The tories are pussies who play it safe. Labour let anything happen and are easily influenced.. UKip say it how it is, which is what people like me like about them.  ",1,1408042170,null,0,false,0,cjqa09h,t3_2djz7o,t1_cjqa09h,t3_2djz7o,null,1435236740,-7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-7

He is, however, more than good enough to hold his own in the squad and challenge for a starting position.

And so, when I say they're upgrades, the ""probably"" is only in reference to the RB position rather than LB since I definitely see Moreno as a marked improvement over any full-back we have at the club (RB or LB). There is obviously some presumption in my statement and this is only based on his performance in the Dortmund game, general mutterings from La Liga followers, my (conversely) well-informed opinions on our own full-backs, and Youtube full game highlights.",0,1408042649,null,0,1408043388,0,cjqaa8u,t3_2dk5sc,t1_cjqaa8u,t3_2dk5sc,null,1435236878,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

So realistically you have until 5pm tomorrow. If you definitely don't want to go to Loughborough you need to phone them and ask them to retract that offer. The situation with York is difficult as I'm not sure how insurance choices work in adjustment. That means that you have to work like your deadline is 5pm tomorrow. That is totally doable. If you phone a uni about adjustment it can be sorted same day in many cases. We are all desperate for adjustment students with good grades.

- To finish 4th, we'd need to exceed expectations on both sides of the ball, OR would need a team to seriously stumble (or a mix of a bit of both)

Cliff has deeply repressed his sexuality but he's also deeply repressed pretty much everything about himself - he's always been a really, really fake person - everything about him is plastic coated and airbrushed, a thin pretence over a very obviously weird secret life; he played a character in everything he did, be it watching wimbledon or performing on stage - the image of a devout Christian appealing to peoples good nature and the twee sentimentality of christmas yet not only was his act far too squeeky clean and inhuman for anyone to believe but the evidence it was a lie was literally everywhere...  
  
It's a form of selection bias really, to rise to prominence in a field like Christmas Records and sentimental pop drivel requires a certain level of perfection which simply isn't reasonably possible, throw into the mix the need for aggressive, secretive and manipulative tactics to fight off competition and protect oneself from being taken advantage of it creates an environment in which it's literally only possible for an exceptionally manipulative and deceptive person to thrive.  
  
The same negative quality selection bias applies in politics, business and most positions of power - it's the very core of the problem of a competition based society, it gives a HUGE advantage not just to people who don't play fair but to the people who play the least fair...  
  
Jimmy and Cliff are a very similar type of person, an archetype of their age maybe - someone that's intensely driven to been seen as a good, important, wonderful type of person -this is often instilled by violent parents or state institutions [e.g. being cained and demeaned in front of the class] and heavy religious imprinting --- they're people not comfortable with themselves and inventing a front to hide behind, using that front to manipulate and control their image to the most tiny degree...

I'm going to ring up tomorrow morning and ask if Politics is still an option. Is that worth doing, and do they ever reconsider on the basis of grades going up after being re-marked?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Passion assessed as a singular attribute isn't necessarily a good thing; it all depends how a person copes with a higher emotional charge. In this context, a player's passion could drive them to perform at a high level for longer periods just as easily as it could lead them to 'see red' and make a rash challenge costing their team the game. Gerrard, over the course of his career, provides a perfect microcosm of these effects; he has lost his head in derbies and he produced some of his most awe-inspiring performances in them too. 

We haven't seen enough derby games involving Flanno to truly assess if he performs better or worse under these circumstances and, for the reasons above, you certainly can't presume that he will. The sample size of games in which we can assess how he reacts to these conditions is lessened when you also consider that his derby games have, at times, been 'runaway' affairs and so are not highly charged in the way a tight, scrappy, *testing* derby might be. 

Even if we assume Flanno does perform at a higher level in this type of game, I'd actually argue that Moreno (and Manquillo, to an extent) are still superior to a.. ahem.. 'high perfomance' Flanno (sounds like a kitchen cleaner). And who's to say that Moreno and Manquillo don't perform better in derbies? The atmosphere and occasion of a derby certainly provide opportunity for players to derive passion from other sources than within themselves.

Is she still doing the same job as 8 years ago, cos she would be the only one in the NHS who is 

&gt;She does actually report to two different hospitals as she is on call to another hospital in the Trust. 

so she is not based in one office reporting to six managers? The way you describe it 'six manger' with no context is fail mailesque in its not report of the whole picture.

It's literally the safest, least reactive gas in the world. It's about as dangerous as a bucket of water and you'd have to be a total imbecile to harm yourself with it.

The situation you describe where you connect a mask straight to a nitrous tank and breathe it in pure form is about the only way I can see this going tits-up for people, and it's really sad.

A little bit of scientific knowledge and common sense that breathing 100% nitrous straight from a tank means you're breathing 0% oxygen would prevent this.

She begins tugging and stroking as her twat moistens, her breasts swelling and her nipples begin to stick out like erasers on a fresh #2 pencil. She grunts with satisfaction as the pig begins eagerly thrusting into her hand, her grip now tightening to maintain control of the pig’s greasy corkscrew cock. She lowers her head to watch the cock work in her hand, groans with satisfaction and begins working her clit with her other muddy hand, her hips gyrating with the rhythm of the pig’s thrusting. “Oh fucking jesus god yes..” she gasps. She changes positions, still maintaining control of the feverishly thrusting cock as the pig’s squealing intensifies. She leans forward and with her lips almost touching the pig’s ear, she whispers your name and begins to shudder. She turns her attention again to the pigs swollen member rocking in her hand. She presses it between her hand and her face, the pig thrusting it against her cheeks as she drools. With a massive grunt and a high pitched squeal, the pig’s balls explode, beginning a massive shower of hot, sour pig jizz. You mother cups one hand under the fountain of steaming genetic material gathering it in her hand as the thrusting comes to an end. The pig shudders and begins to walk to the trough of slop in the corner of it’s pen, but your mother tackles it to the ground. She lifts it’s tail and smears the handful of pig load into the pig’s own fetid butthole, turning flakes of crusty pig shit into a pigshit-pigjizz mud slop on the pigs ass. Now she tilts her head to the sky and screams your name, not once, not twice, but three times. She slams her face full force into the pig’s butthole and it’s wreath of shitsemen pudding, her tongue machine gun flicking the rim and then burying itself to the hilt inside the pig’s hot colon. Your mother works her tongue around the inside of the pigs ass, and then as a few incoherent syllables escaped her now brown lips, spurts of female ejaculate spurt from her pulsating cunt. Exhausted, she collapses in the mud, rolls over onto her back, and lights a cigarette. She takes one long drag, looks again to the sky, and speaks your name one last time before she drifts off to sleep. That’s your mom. Your mom does that.

They deliberately made the job look as cheap and shoddy as possible, even down to using courier as their font, just so it looked like they really needed the money.

When the Icelandic banks collapsed, the Cats protection league lost £11m they had stashed. They didn't stash it there because they ran out of cats to protect

Preseason is no indication of a player, this time as season I thought Aspas looked alright, but Coutinho really has been magnificent. Coupled with the form he was in during the last part of the season, I reckon he's in for a true breakout season. 

Regarding the Kompany point you made, I don't think we need him. I've said for ages our defensive personnel are not the problem, it's the system. If Kompany was in our defense last season, he would have been just as horribly exposed by the lack of full backs and defensive cover from the midfield.

 [**11th Doctor**](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/11th%20Doctor): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;The __Eleventh Doctor__ was a capricious and adventurous incarnation of the renegade [Time Lord](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Lord) known as [the Doctor](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Doctor). [The Moment](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Moment) referred to him as ""the man who forgets"", in reference to his claim not to remember how many children were on [Gallifrey](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Gallifrey) on the last day of the [Last Great Time War](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Last_Great_Time_War). ([TV](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/TV): *[The Day of the Doctor](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor_(TV_story\))*) He later became a man fond of remembering his precious life. However, by this point in his life, his reputation had grown immense, attracting a new strain of conflicts in place of the war. Wishing to withdraw from the dangers it created, he became a secretive and guileful individual for the sake of himself and those he held close. He engaged in a centuries-long struggle to the death against his enemies, including an assassination plot and a last stand. He was possibly the Doctor's most long-lived incarnation, as well as the final incarnation in the Doctor's original regeneration cycle.

Lallana came into the conversation because I said if I could swap any of Sturridge, Sterling and Coutinho for Kompany I'd choose Coutinho for the following reasons:

Surridge is an amazingly talented striker, who wants to play for us. He's young, English, good at forming partnerships, and I could see him as a choice for captain once he matures. He's the kind of striker who you'd have to pay silly money to replace.

Sterling is our future. He's at the stage in his development where the question is not whether he'll become world class or not, but world class in what position. He'd excel in any of the four front positions, and could do a capable job in a few more. He's the best 19 year old footballer in the world imo.

Coutinho is a great #10, and can do a good job in CM or out wide. However, Sterling is better at #10, better out wide, and we've got one of the most exciting young wingers in Europe (Markovic) waiting in reserve. We also have Lallana (who can play on the wing) and Can vying for the spot next to Hendo, not to mention the likes of Allen and Rossiter. As a Brazilian, he's more likely to fuck off to Spain too.

The strength and depth means that of our three biggest assets, Coutinho is the most expendable.

After the debts are paid off you'll be saving a lot more, and will be in a much better position to start looking at renting.

To look at your financial situation, start keeping track of where all your money is going. Write down what you spend, or get receipts for everything. After a couple of weeks to a month, you'll be able to see exactly where your money is going, and where you could cut back.

It sounds like you've already started doing this to an extent - cancelling subscriptions, not eating out so much (or getting takeaways), etc. But it might also need a cutback on socialising (e.g. going out drinking, gaming, or any other more expensive hobbies you have).

Also, if you're getting rid of the bike - will you be selling it and getting a bit of money from that? The £120 each month from not paying the insurance will be a big help too - when does that get cancelled?

So true!

[political opinion]The whole purpose of tax credits is to shift state financial support away from the bogeyman of ""benefits"", and instead pretend that it's ""lowering the tax burden"". Instead of the cash raised from tax being passed to the department(s) familiar with handing out help (and with dealing with people who have less-than-stable circumstances), it's kept on the HMRC balance sheet, and they hand it back out on the annual-adjustment approach with which they approach almost everything.

Everyone is a winner, especially neo-liberal economists and their political lackies, and except for those who end up in debt to the HMRC through no fault of their own.[/political opinion]

I agree entirely, I guess I'm not as eloquent explaining that as you.

&gt;I think we're too imbalanced in that case.

I don't agree entirely.  We're only imbalanced if the rest of the team doesn't account for him playing inside.  I also think ""balance"" is rather overrated.  We would be ""balanced"" with two traditional wingers bombing up the sideline and putting in crosses, but that doesn't mean its going to be the most effective.

&gt;In any case, I just don't like the idea that Eriksen is suddenly a left winger because he played well when kind of playing from that side.

I use the term winger very loosely.  It doesn't always mean he hugs the sideline and tries to constantly take on the fullback and put in a cross.

BUT it could still be real because some boys can reach puberty quicker than others, so Moreno could be their lovechild.

* In fact, you may want to initially play hard to get - Amy from the series goes through a phase where she has forgotten about her fiance, Rory, and pursues the Doctor.  If she gets into the role, you may find yourself backed into a corner.  Perhaps make a weak objection like ""But what about Rory?""
* Chances are, the first kiss should leave you with an expression on your face of complete shock and awe before you snap out of it.
* The Doctor seldom refers to Amy as Amy.  It's more usually ""Pond"" or ""Amelia"".  ""Amelia Pond!"" for shocking revelations!
* One of his most iconic phrases is ""Come along, Pond"", usually said before charging into adventure.
* Other catchphrases include ""I wear a bowtie now, bowties are cool."", and ""Geronimo!""  To a lesser extent, you can substitute any item of clothing for the phrase, so ""I wear a stetson now, stetsons are cool"" works too.
* Usually, the more serious this Doctor is trying to take himself, the more absurd he becomes.  So a striptease would have ended up with him falling in a pile on the floor, only to leap up again as if he'd been attacked by invisible ninjas.

You can't compare Europe to the US... Especially the UK and Ireland (not certain about others) where police don't even use guns, save for armed response units who are specialised task forces. If UK police deal with riots the old fashioned way, not even resorting to things like rubber bullets until things become extreme, then what happens with a nation who's police already use firearms in every day policing? Their criminals are a lot more dangerous as a result, so do they not need tougher enforcement during riots?

Either way, I've always been one to side with gearing police with better equipment, but not just simply arming untrained officers to the teeth. A show of force is always a good deterrent, but when kept at a distance; in sight and not interfering until actually needed. But of course those cops are just assaulting protesters and media, and then completely disappearing during the night riots. The militarisation of police in any country is dangerous, but in the US?

UPDATE: Met the guy who drove into me on the train earlier today. Apparently he just got his focus back on the road last week, after not having it for 3 months, and now it's been written off! They said repairs would cost £5k, dead shocking cause it didn't look too bad. My bike repairs yet to be valued, really hope mine doesn't get written off too, that would suck!

The issue is that a civil air transport aircraft will have a sealed, conditioned cabin. The air is ~60+% recycled; likely more on a budget airline. So the peanuts didn't have to be physically close to her, the cabin conditioning system would have dispersed particles throughout the aircraft.

So imagine it like this: if you sit her 10 feet away from a plate of peanuts, she will likely be fine.

If you're willing to take some advice of random internet stranger who just turned 30 though - I would offer this. You've got a great starting point here. From this point on, whenever you're given, or earn some money, take 10% of it and add it what you already have. You have time on your side, and it will soon build up, and you won't even miss it.

I don't have many problems watching all the Liverpool games on TSN or SNP. If they aren't showing one of them on tv then there are plenty or live streams available to watch.
