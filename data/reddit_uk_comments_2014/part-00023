true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;but what is our financial situation actually like?

Business-wise, I think we're in stable and solid position. But perhaps not quite at the point where we can spend freely, overspend and gamble on players.

For a club like Chelsea? They can quite literally afford to gamble on an unproven player like Salah playing in a weak league. They can afford to plop down the 12 million pounds and offer a strong contract for him and not even blink.

For a club like us? Not as easy. (And combine that with the fact that without guaranteed Champions League play, it's a bit more difficult to attract players).

&gt;Is there a budget?

Y'know, I personally think the idea of FSG being unable to spend is a bit overblown. We *do* have the money to spend. In fact, I would even go so far as to speculate that we have a *significant* amount of money to spend on a player. However, I don't think we can afford to gamble on a player and lose.

Again, if Salah doesn't work for Chelsea? No worries. Chelsea will carry on. However, say, we got Salah for 12 million or even went so far as to outbid Chelsea (13 million? 14 million? 15 million?) and offered more wages than Chelsea for Salah and then Salah fails... it's a bigger consequence for us. It's harder for us to take that gamble.

In fact, gambling is a great way to think about it: If you've got a bit of money, losing a hundred pounds on a long shot isn't that bad. But for the rest of us, maybe we have that hundred pounds to spend, maybe even two hundred pounds to spend... but to lose that money will have a bigger impact on us.

And, well, that's the frustrating position that we are in.",0,1390535687,null,0,false,0,cexg5j7,t3_1vycpy,t1_cexg5j7,t1_cex9rrf,null,1432082321,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Sturridge.

And out of those successes, the only ones that have improved the first team drastically are Sturridge and Suarez. We paid £8 million for Coutinho, and maybe this season we're seeing why we got him for so cheap. I really hope he can pull it together. Enrique is a liability. Henderson is good but he's not Champions League quality. We paid £17 million for Sakho. And I think he's worth it. We're obviously prepared to spend money as £17 million on a defender is still considered big money. In a few seasons I think Sakho could truly be properly world class.

Totally agree here. Perhaps that is why we seem to be targeting more attacking players. Generally speaking, in my opinion, defenders need to work more as a *unit* and that understanding is developed over time whereas an attacking player can operate more like an individual and just be asked to create some magic, score some goals.

To me, the chances of a DM coming straight into our squad and making an impact is lower than the chances of an attacking player.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;FSG are living in fantasy land if they think they can get in the top 4 without throwing the cash around. It's ludicrous. It's so frustrating for us.

I made this point in another comment: Essentially, I believe we *do* have the money to spend but I think the consequences of gambling on a player and *failing* is a bigger consequence for us than, say, Chelsea.

I used a betting analogy in that comment: A rich guy can put down a hundred pounds on a long shot and if he loses, no big deal. Another guy with modest means could easily pull together a hundred pounds or, hell, even two hundred without trouble but can he afford to put it on a long shot and lose? Probably not. If he loses, then maybe he won't be back to the track for a few months, know what I mean.

So, in the context of Salah... Chelsea can afford to risk 12 million pounds + wages. If Salah can't make it in the Premier League? Whatever. Loan him out. Sell him. Next.

Liverpool, on the other hand, would have had to match that 12 million and probably more wages (because we don't have the seductive power of Champions League) and if Salah ends up more like Stewart Downing, then you'd have supporters moaning about why we paid so much bloody money for Salah (or ""that Egyptian fuck"" for our less cultured supporters). We have more to lose if our gambles don't pan out.

But that's the frustrating situation, right? Every player is a gamble. But - using the gambling analogy again - you can't win if you don't play. It'll be very interesting to see how we close out January.

&gt;Really, our transfer business has been woeful since FSG arrived.

This was the comment I really wanted to discuss.

Speaking more big-picture-wise, it was interesting to see our failures/successes listed out like that. And initially I did think you were being too harsh but your point stands: If a player - especially one who (i.e. Aspas, Allen, Borini) is intended to contribute to the first team - is not making LFC a better side, then, at the moment, they're failures aren't they?

This brings me to an interesting article I read in The Tomkins Times back in January of 2012 ([I found the article](http://tomkinstimes.com/2012/01/a-review-of-the-dalglishcomolli-signings/) which was free back then but it's for subscribers now) that discussed a theory about transfer success rates.

Ultimately, the point was that **if 50% of your transfers are ""successful"" then we can consider that good business overall** 

(There was a lot of discussion and criteria on ""success"" and ""failure"" which we can discuss some other time).

Using your list, FSG brought in 17 players. You/we consider 6 of them to be a success. That's a 35% ""success"" rate.

And if we are to use the Tomkins Times model, then that is *not* a good success rate for us.

(At the moment, I can't be bothered to compare other teams and their success rate but it'd be interesting to see how we compare).

But that's some interesting perspective, isn't it?

Maybe it's a bit more understandable that FSG want to be cautious and make sure we make the *right* signing as opposed to just making a signing for the sake of it.

Of course, that being said, while I want us to make the *right* signing, to do *nothing* this window would raise more than eyebrow for me. It'd raise my ire. (And multiple pints).

You can't win if you don't play.

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"Surely, I agree, but for a club in our position (No CL, not unlimited finances), it's very hard to justify ANY purchase at that price point. If it were in the cards, I would love the club to splash the cash on a proven, world-class player like Mata or Ozil for that price, but for someone like Willian, it wasn't worth the risk, even if he has turned out good.

We need depth, and we need prospects for the future. Obviously, these should not our first priorities, every window, without fail, but until we have more cash on hand, we need to weigh every purchase carefully. I've no doubt that our team would be stronger with Willian in the side, but what if that purchase had come at the expense of Sakho and Cissokho (just to say the least) I know Cissokho isn't highly rated on this sub, but he's good enough to at least do a job.

Let's say we get Willian, but miss out on just those two players (to say nothing of Alberto, Aspas, etc). He certainly improves the first team, relegating Sterling to the bench, or Coutinho when off-form. But now what happens when Enrique gets injured? Sure, we had Flanagan step up, but we couldn't have predicted that he'd work well in that role, especially given how absolutely dire he was in the games he got under Kenny. What about Agger's injury, forcing the horrible CB combo of Kolo and Skrtel. With our injury problems this season, what if one of them gets injured?

Then our options are Ilori (untested), Kelly (back from an injury layoff, and NEVER tested as a CB at the senior level), maybe Wisdom (same as Kelly with his senior experience at RB, also younger and less polished in general).

Yes, top players improve teams, but there's only so long that a good team can compensate for a weak spot. When we played Spurs, we saw that, for all their marquee players, a few defensive injuries (Rose, Chiriches, Vertonghen) were enough to see them play two very young, inexperienced LBs (Naughton and Fryers) and a CB pairing of arguably their 3rd best CB (Dawson), and a CM playing out of position. Just three defensive injuries, and for all their expensive purchases (Lamela, Paulinho, Soldado etc) we thrashed them at their own stadium.

Take our current team, add Willian and subtract Cissokho and Sakho. Sakho was 17m, Cissokho was 1 or 2 as a loan fee, and Willian was 30. That puts us at around 10-12 million pounds less than we currently have, although depending on wages, it could be maybe a little closer to our current situation.

Take this makeshift team, and give an injury to Enrique, Johnson, and Agger. Now we've got no senior left back, so maybe we call back Robinson from loan (that is, if we even can). We play Flanno at RB, knowing that he's untested and hasn't impressed at the senior level, but Kelly is still unfit and injured, and our CB pairing is limited to Toure and Skrtel (Or, if we try out the Kolo RB experiment, Skrtel and Ilori).

In this case, Willian might add goals and dynamics to our attack, but that's not going to cover for a Robinson-Skrtel-Toure-Flanno defense, especially if Mignolet has a howler or too.

I would love marquee players as much as anyone else, and it's easy to look at some of our signings (Aspas, Cissokho, Moses) and say they've underperformed, and in many cases, they have. They're not players that will make us title contenders, or even CL candidates, but they can keep us treading water during times of injury or suspension.

I'd love both, but unless we are deep at most positions, depth will always have to take priority over marquee signings, even if it's less exciting. I would have loved to get Costa or Mkhitaryen or Willian, but not at the cost of being one injury away from shitting the bed, which is also why I think it's so important that we bring in another DM this window.",0,1390546203,null,0,false,0,cexjz76,t3_1vycpy,t1_cexjz76,t1_cexj7ib,null,1432084250,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I just find our transfer policy to be a little strange. So far we have Sturridge, Sahko and possibly Mignolet from all our transfer dealings, who look like first team successes. In time Coutihno could well be considered,  though I think we have over hyped his current level a bit.

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"I think there are two sides to understanding scouts/managers from a transfer standpoint. On one hand, they see things we don't. Even managers considered tactically inept have the knowledge to identify talent in areas that we don't even know about. I don't know about you guys, but at Chelsea, I thought Sturridge was pretty useless. His loan at Bolton was a flash in the pan. Obviously, we see how he turned out. They're also good at predicting flops/development (or just see more of players). Remember when this sub thought that Adam Morgan was going to be a great player for us just because Fowler once said something nice about him?

On the other hand, even if they are more efficient at spotting talent, mistakes are possible, and some things can't be accounted for. Borini didn't impress last season, and was injured, but looks like he could come good. He needs regular game time, and behind Sturridge and Suarez in a (generally) one-striker formation, it wasn't likely to come. Aspas scored a dozen league goals in a good league last season. Certainly I didn't expect him to flop so hard.

Even the best, best managers (Ferguson, Mourinho, our own Shanks and Paisley) have had flops. It happens. However, as we saw with Carroll, an expensive flop causes financial ripples that affect the club for years, as well as making us the butt of every joke for years. Conversely, a flop that costs 5m opposed to 35 is a disappointment, but ultimately not a huge issue.

There's no secret to transfers. Some people are better than others at identifying talent, but even the best in the business will get as many wrong as they get right. Look at Fergie. For every RVP, there is a Bebe. For every Carrick, there is a Cleverley. For every Rooney, there is a Kagawa.

It may be frustrating, but if Alberto or Aspas had slotted into the first team and been immense, we'd be praising the transfer committee for their brilliance. If Sturridge had flopped, we would have been mad that we ""wasted"" millions on him. Especially given that Sturridge and Coutinho have both been good, we've found that there is value in the market. We quibbled about money with Sigurdsson and Dempsey, but in hindsight, were they huge losses? We quibbled about Willian, and lost a great player.

These things are going to happen at any price point, at any age and position. When you're a big club, with big ambitions, you're going to be burned by some transfers, and filled with regret by missed ones. Rafa made ""small"" transfer fee signings like Luis Garcia, Momo, and Reina that succeeded, and made big transfers like Aquilani, Babel, and Keane that flopped. He made many poor small transfers (Dossena, N'Gog, Jovanovic), and some great big ones (Torres, Xabi, Mascherano).

It's just hard to predict. There's nothing inherently bad about our transfer policy. Sure, someone like Cissokho had been out of form and favor, but so were Sturridge and Coutinho. Moses had been decent, but not great for Chelsea, but has potential and ability and could have turned it around, like Henderson did. At the end of the day, I hate it when players flop, and it love it when we make it rain and purchase huge players, but that's not realistic. Under Hodgson, we bought players that were hopeless, but there has been a REASON for every player we've brought in under Rodgers and the committee. They may not have worked out, but the system is in place, and to me, that makes me feel much more confident in our network.

If Rodgers comes out and says that someone like Kevin Doyle would be a great addition to the squad, or thinks we should bolster our LB options by re-signing Aurelio, then we have cause to be worry, but that hasn't happened. Of our transfers, some have worked out and some haven't, but none of them were complete headscratchers when they happened, meaning that no one has gone off the deep end, and that the club system is working as intended.

Firstly, in this scenario the bond wrapper is there to provide tax efficieny, although it may affect the available investment. They are often advised in the Middle East as they allow tax free growth until encashment, even if you move/repatriate to a high tax jurisdiction. (It may be beneficial to seek advice on where to cash them out in order to minimise the tax bill.)

Secondly, I had to go do some digging rather than rely on memory alone for the specifics on mirror funds. From [WiseGeek](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-mirror-fund.htm) 

&gt;""Rather than investing directly into a major fund, someone pays into another account that is then used by an established company to buy into the actual mutual fund. The major benefit of this type of investment is that there are no entry or exit charges that need to be paid. A mirror fund may not be as profitable as it initially seems, however, since the return on it is likely to be substantially lower than on the mutual fund it reflects.""

There is also some further info from the [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-1338628/Mirror-funds-Investments-charge-twice.html) and a [financial blog posting](http://blog.expat-financial-advice.com/information/investing-offshore/mirror-funds/):-

&gt;Some of the larger offshore financial institutions (such as Aviva, Generali International, and Scottish Life International) offer you direct access into the funds that you choose. Others however, establish a version of the fund to facilitate greater ‘liquidity’ – these funds are known as mirror funds.
The mirror fund invests only in the underlying fund, but instead of investing your capital directly into it, the financial institution creates a fully licensed and regulated mirror version of it. On top of the additional administration costs that come with running a mirror version of the fund, it has to meet financial regulation standards in its own right, and therefore incurs compliance expenses too.
If the mirror fund is managed by an external fund manager, additional charges can also be levied to cover their fees, similar to the charges in a ‘fund of funds’ product.

It still feels hard, however i'm confident that this year will be the year i can personally turn it around. With the 5% deposit mortgages a family member has agreed to give me the few thousand i'd need to secure a home, cutting the money i'm paying on rent by about £300 per month. With half of that going to credit card repayments and the other half being used to keep me away from the credit cards i'm hopeful that as long as work remains steady this year will get better. If that is the case and the dark clouds over my head start to fade, i'll need to have a serious think about who to vote for in the next election. I'm from a very poor family who was raised hating the tories (poll tax, closure of the mines etc)... But the credit crunch started when i was 16 and started work, during a tory gov i've managed to secure an apprenticeship which 4 years later is very well paying, have a happy healthy child who has been on a few holidays, and will hopefully have bought my first home.

Have you already bought a ticket as part of a package? Are you coming with anyone else?

I'm a season ticket holder, and it sounds like you would struggle in the MHL where I sit. When I look to my right at the West Stand, I see a number of disabled supporters sitting in the front row of that stand, with and without their chairs. I think there are similar facilities in the East, but can't be 100%.

The club is usually extremely helpful in circumstances like these. This season they have significantly upped the number of staff outside and around the approach areas to the gates, to assist with directions and any difficulties. I regularly see people who need extra assistance being walked to or taken in via separate entrances rather than the turnstiles.

Enjoy your trip.

This is already happening and is part of the national strategy for long term conditions. In different areas different tools are used but it's already being pushed. Most notably NHS England have been offering financial incentives to GP practices case find high risk patients to actively case manage.

Usual algorithms involve hospital data on A&amp;E, emergency admissions and outpatient attendances being mixed with GP practice data about who is on a disease register (if they have hypertension, asthma or whatever). One tool which is particularly advanced (ACG-adjusted clinical groups) can identify ""emergent risk groups"" and was developed in America for the purposes of insurance premium calculations.

There is NO conclusive evidence it works as yet. All it is is pro-active case finding. In the incentive schemes most of the patients are already known to the practice it just gives them some cash to actively manage them.

More advanced algorithms use GP information on prescriptions and other interventions. They fall down because GP practice data is rarely coded properly-there are exceptions but most GP practices will not invest in admin staff to code unless there is a financial incentive to do so (payment for patients on disease registers are standard for example).

Recent changes to information governance and Caldicott guidance have meant some areas are not being allowed to run risk stratification depending on how local bodies interpret the guidance. No one has asked patients if they want this to happen to their data and unfortunately it's not like tesco where people just have to tick a little box saying ""I refuse to let my data be used in this way"". This would be a huge change in patient rights to privacy and there is no money for a national consent survey in the NHS right now-at least NHS England and the Department of Health aren't planning one. Additionally if you did ask people it is likely more people who need proactive care in the next 10-20 years (mainly over 60 year olds because they cost the most) will refuse it because they won't understand it. 

I see the potential but if I'm honest the way things are going there probably won't be an NHS to get the long term benefits from health promotion interventions (like saying you can save 10 years through not smoking or whatever). By then it'll all be private/health budgets UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!

Stuff that he might find useful:

 * Bars on wall near, or a stand thing that fits around, the toilet, to make it easier to stand up/sit down.

 * Bars on wall of bath.

 * Seat lift thing to get in/out of the bath

 * Chair lift if there are any stairs.

 * Possibly bars/railings in public areas of flat too, or a wheel chair ramp if needed.

 * Check the water temp and turn that thing down. For some reason ppl seem to like scalding hot water.

 * Get rid of the damn rugs on the floor. Old people like them but they're tripping hazards and you _cannot_ make them stay down at the corners (just had that fight)

 * Check the blasted oven. Replace gas -&gt; electric because you cannot blow up the house with an electric oven. Here the oven required a special ""technique"" to light....

 * Do not put up with that WWII hoarding mentality. Put the piles of crap out of the way. They are tripping hazards and emergency workers can't get to your family if that stuff is in the way. Work towards recycling what you can and donating to charity shops what you can't.

 * Check the food situation. Again, hoarding, and out of date stuff.

 * Cupboards. Look to move the most commonly used things to lower shelves. Especially glasses should not be so high up.

 * Non-slip mat in the bath.

 * See what you can do to get the place insulated if they insist on turning down the heat to save money. Also sometimes systems might need cleaning. Radiators can be flushed out to be more efficient, etc.

 * Gas fireplaces - gak. Explosion hazard since they usually require special tricks to turn on or ""its the way you hold your mouth"" and other such quaint sayings :p

 * Look for the cables that can be tripping hazards. Especially if they have portable radiators.

 * Clothes drying racks/lines that require reaching or are put up in the way.

 * Kettles. Boiling water + old hands = possible burning hazard, especially with cables attached. Get rid of the stove-top kettle and get an electric one. My mum has a stand thing which the kettle sits in which lets the entire kettle be tipped forward to pour. It means that they don't need to lift the entire kettle of boiling water, just pour it out.

He doesn't have anyone alongside him designated to shield the back 4/3/5 (*edit). In this system the deep lying playmaker has a pretty significant defensive role especially defending the counter-attack or if the opponents play through their pressing.

Agree when you mention Gerrard's role in the double pivot alongside Lucas, as we've used at times earlier this season. We did okay like that, allowed Gerrard to dictate the play from deep but the main issue with two deep midfielders we just didn't have the numbers to press high, win the ball early.

So when we shifted to the 1-2 two midfield, most obviously when Gerrard got injured, having the two hardworking, athletic, technical players working box-to-box, pressing, winning the ball and joining the attack added a new dimension to the game. You can understand why Brendan wanted to keep this system, but it does mean that the deep lying midfielder will often be isolated. This will be exacerbated in the english league compared to the italian league where the ball will often be lumped forward faster, bypassing the press and requiring the deep lying midfielder to win aerial balls or anticipate second balls. 

At Stoke it was very much the same system as Juventus use, a deep lying playmaker behind two hard working pressing midfielders. Based on that game it wasn't fully convincing, but not a disaster.

How come the introduction of GM crops in Africa has been absolutely disastrous? GM crops are falling below the previously crops in Africa? 

GM BT Cotton failed in South Africa

&gt;A 2012 review reported that by the 2010/11 growing season, the area planted to Bt cotton had shrunk to a minuscule 500 hectares – a decline of more than 90% from the area under cultivation during the period of Bt cotton’s claimed success (1998–2000). Yields continued to vary widely according to rainfall levels, hovering within 10% of what they were before Bt cotton was introduced. Overall pest control costs remained significantly higher with Bt cotton (65% of total input costs) than with non-Bt cotton (42% of total input costs).

Or the GM Soy and maize failing, again in South Africa 

http://www.thenewage.co.za/21688-1008-53-GM_project_faces_ruin

Or our environment minister calling GM crops a ""saviour"" bullshit? 

&gt;Yet as Denis Murphy - a leading biotech expert - tells spiked, while a more positive attitude from government is a good thing, the idea that GM will solve these short-term problems is ‘bullshit’.

http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/5438

GM crops are not what you think they are. They have their benefits but they aren't the ""feed the world"" hype propaganda you swallowed whole with no objective thought.

And seeing as - introducing GM crops in some areas has actually been a compelte and disastrous failure and even where they are flourishing they're still not the ""feed the whole world"" horseshit they're PR department are pushing I do not consider it safe to hand over the influence of them owning our agricultural industry.

&gt;

&gt;A **police box** is a British telephone kiosk or callbox located in a public place for the use of members of the police, or for members of the public to contact the police. Unlike an ordinary callbox, its telephone is located behind a hinged door so it can be used from the outside, and the interior of the box is, in effect, a miniature police station for use by police officers.[vague]

&gt;Police boxes predate the era of mobile telecommunications; now British police officers carry two-way radios and/or mobile phones rather than relying on fixed kiosks.:2 Most boxes are now disused or have been withdrawn from service.

&gt;The typical police box contained a telephone linked directly to the local police station, allowing patrolling officers to keep in contact with the station, reporting anything unusual or requesting help if necessary. A light on top of the box would flash to alert an officer that he/she was requested to contact the station.:2 Members of the public could also use the phone  ...

I don't think this is to do with BR.

BR isn't at all involved in negotiations. Salah *was* part of the plan for seasons ahead. that's why we were talking to basel. and if he is the plan for seasons ahead, isn't it worth paying that extra bit rather than waiting for someone else to come in?

&gt; I imagine LFC walking in to the meeting room, being completely honest with the players and not promising them full 1st team slots or over exaggerated wages and other incentive. I think they're being truthful and respectful and saying it how it is and hoping to appeal to the footballers sense of morality.

It's generally not the case we can't convince players to come here, but rather we can't agree a fee. the problems have mainly been club to club, not club to player. generally by the time you come to talk to a club you've already sounded out if the player is interested or not. we are shit at negotiating and are trying to low ball everyone and take too long, that's why we get sniped.

The bit about George V managing to bring in reforms and seriously smooze the gov of the time so as to divert public attention away from thoughts of following other european countries was really fascinating. I understand slightly more why so many (posh) people embraced the nazis in the 30s, due to the shared opposition to communism (and all the other crap too of course).

I guess the marconi stuff was similar to the iranian nuclear scientists getting bumped off in the last few years. Would be nice to know for sure though.

When I first read 1984 it was more of a chore, because it was when the film had come out. I didn't like it at all, the story was choppy and didn't flow at all. Then years later there was a bbc documentary called State of Mind about two gymnasts training up for the insane mass games in n korea, and there was a shot of the radio that was installed in all elite homes. The sound could be turned down at night but never completely off. I felt such a chill down my spine, you wouldn't believe. So I went back to the book and started looking at the disjointed parts rather than the story. E.g. they would go into the countryside to escape monitoring. When Ceaucescu was disposed there was a show about holidaying in Romania and they talked about how untouched and pristine the countryside was because everyone had been forced to live in towns and cities. 

But that may just be confirmation bias on my part. It's easy to see coincidences like that with hindsight. I do find the whole thing about Orwell writing out a list of 'cryptos' more and more relevant, what with the infiltration of seriously questionable so-called marxists groups in public services and civil rights groups of the 70s. 

Every day I feel more and more that GCHQ, corrupt politicians and so on are like our own painting in the attic rather than something separate from what we do as ordinary members of the public.

We can all agree that Manchester United was one (and will be soon), our direct rival for the 1st spot in the EPL..

I also read that Manchester United will lose £25-30m if they miss on the Champions League, and £40m if they miss on EL.

So let me point out exactly what did we trigger.

1. Rooney one of their most valuable players was unsettled since Utd didn't make smart investments in the club, he wanted to leave last May

2. Before this moment, in Utd no one had motivation, they were losing stupid games, they were unsettled.

3. What did we do? We gave them a great player in January. There are strong rumours now that Rooney will sign a new contract.

4. Man Utd gets its confidence back, they get a great player, and another great player who was unsettled will now sign a new contract.

5. Their chances for reaching 4th spot just got MASSIVELY improved.

6. If they reach 4th spot, they wont miss on the £30m.

7. So they might get two GREAT players (MATA + WANTAWAY ROONEY) FOR FREE

Summer comes, UTD will sign a good left back, and another CM.

Next season starts, UTD is now a great candidate for the 1st place of the EPL.

Hey OP!

Please don't feel alone. There are ways of applying for help. You say you're not a student anymore?

Apply for Jobseekers allowance &amp; Housing benefit. I was made redundant last October and it saved me! Your rent is paid, and they can even loan you money (obviously take it out a later payment) if you're stuck. This should help you get through til your next jon.

You can apply online [HERE](http://www.gov.uk/jobseekers) or ring 0845 6043719. For housing benefit, go to your local council office and ask to speak to one of the Housing Benefits team.

If you have to leave your home or you feel unsafe, please go to the [Manchester Homeless Centre](http://www.homelessuk.org/details.asp?id=UK1740) or visit [THIS WEBSITE](http://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/cgi-bin/id/city.cgi?city=Manchester&amp;state=CT) for more places.

Don't worry! There are people and places to help you. PM me if you need any more info. 

And remember, if you genuinely feel unsafe, you can ring the police on 999 or 101 for non-emergencies.

If you read the rest of the paragraph you plucked that quote from then it'll be obvious he's talking about content illegal under Terrorism Legislation. He describes how it's decided if it's illegal, what their current approach is and finally (as you quoted) what their new approach will be.

&gt; In the last paragraph he clearly says ""I share the Prime Minster's aim to protect vulnerable people from all types of harmful content.""

This is talking about legal, but harmful content that they want the kiddie filters to catch (again read the preceding paragraph for context). So is pretty irrelevant to your conclusion as it's not talking about illegal material.

&gt; He is not just talking about terrorist websites here, the end goal is to have anything that is illegal permanently blocked.

He is only discussing illegal material in the context of terrorist or extremist content, you're just choosing to read specific quotes rather than the letter as a whole.

To summarise, they want to block illegal terrorist or extremist material. They want ISPs to put material harmful to kids in their filters.

true,Shamyrock,IE,ireland,"Updates:

* Jose in the hizouse! Almost 12,000 watching on youtube.

* Mata medical with United confirmed. ""Deal going in a good direction.""

* This club is a special club, the club is very respectful with the players especially those who wrote history with the club like Mata.

* He could be a very important player for us but it is a fantastic opportunity for him. ""Its the right offer for us."" Many managers think top players should go to a top rival but the player deserves respect. It is the right offer and we allowed him to negotiate.

* Its a good offer, respectful to us and the player. Allows us to buy another player and is a good profit on the investment in Mata.

* Asked Mata if he wanted to leave when the offer came. He said he is happy to go. Felt mixed emotions, good opportunity for him but will miss him. Good for premier league and in financial terms.

* He was fantastic for Chelsea and Chelsea was good for him. We are not afraid, we want him to do well and be happy.

* He tried to give everything, but the team is doing well and winning consecutively. Willian, Hazard and Oscar are doing very well and he was on the bench. Every time he went to bring him on to change the game they scored before he had the chance. He was annoyed because things didn't go in his favour.

* You can't stop people from being happy. When he plays at stamford bridge, the stadium will be happy for him.

* Salah is not a replacement for Mata. They were not prepared for the bid, it was in the works before.

* Will travel to him for medical in Switzerland.

* Doesn't know what Liverpool did before us. Just knows that they contacted Basel to see if the player could be negotiated.

* He likes the fact he can play the same way our attacking players do, right, left or behind the striker. Fast, creative.

* Sorry sneezed, didn't miss much. Just list of our attacking midfielders on loan than can play behind striker.

* He and Chelsea were and are ready to help young players like KdB. He couldn't find a balance and it wasn't good enough for us but Chelsea are good at helping players fit in and adjust.

* We are doing well with scounting with the permission of other players. Do well in transfer windows. Able to get players as replacements for right price because deals are done early.

* Hopes no more players are coming in. ""We are not doing a striker. We are not doing a striker.""

* Essien is in a position where if he wants he can go or stay. We would be happy if he stayed because he is a fantastic team player. Its a year of a world cup and we will show him respect if something big comes to him.

* Essien plays against stoke.

* Torres is only injury, out for around 3 weeks.

* Mourinho's injury is fine. Old fracture and will be ok in a few weeks. No pain or pain killers.

* Seemed to facepalm at Wenger's reaction on the Mata transfer.

* ""Wenger complaining is normal."" But when a player plays for a club and two weeks later plays against his old side that is normal because it is the market. If Arsene sells Ozil to United he would be happy because it is good. As Wenger should be with Mata. Arsenal always gets the better day to play. Get more time to rest and its not fair. It is never fair because they always get the right time to rest and play.

* He helps young, talented players to be better. Like Willian, Ozil and Oscar. He tries to help. Wants to give time but they need to realize there is pressure.

* Nobody is happy Juan is leaving. Chelsea supporters would not be happy if we told players they could not be happy. It is not a risk because we know he is going to do well. It is what he wants.

* We lost against Stoke not long ago. They are a difficult physical team.

* He is a building a team that is dominate in possession without losing the normal aspect of his teams. A mixture of youth and experience. If Essien is leaving, Matic is here with about a 7 year difference.

Fin.

**Notes**
 There were a couple of long speeches in there but I try to keep this post as short as possible while still getting as much information as possible.

Also when asked if the price was around 40 million for Mata he said he didn't want to say a price and be off by a million or two so make of that what you will.

I'm going to go and dip my fingers in a bucket of ice.

true,W_LothianAnswer,eng-somerset,Somerset,"GM is by no means a magic bullet. We will still need fertilizers and pesticides. Crop rotation and agronomy will still be important.

However, GM could feasibly be used to ensure that the Rhizobium bacteria no longer only reside on the roots of legumes, but also on cereals and other crops, reducing (not eliminating) the need for Nitrate to be applied manually. Obviously, we still need crop rotation. We still need sustainable soil science and sensible use of land. But we can reduce our reliance of petroleum based fertilizers by using such methods *in combination* with GM.

GM does not solve deforestation. I never claimed it did. Although, making more efficient use of the land we already have is not a bad thing.

GM *can* help with the issue of monocultures. One problem with pesticides and herbicides is that they can be fairly broad ranging, and their use can wipe out other wildlife in the field as a side effect. More resilient crops leads to decreased use of such methods. Given that our fields are already monocultures, due to the need to eliminate any imperfections before food reaches the supermarkets, GM certainly will not make the issue worse.

true,Pikul,lfc87,null,"Clubs are always doing business of course, there's so much going on behind the scenes that we don't or will never hear about, I've said that here a few times myself. There's obviously a large list of players we've scouted and have reports on. I don't believe for a second that the club is doing nothing about transfers, even when we're not hearing anything from the media about it.

When it comes to how transfers work, like anyone here, I don't know much of what actually goes on, we can only go on what we're fed by the media. According to the Echo, who when it comes to some of the details on transfers seem to be the most reliable generally, it seems like we were playing hardball again over a couple of million (our 8 mil vs their 11 mil valuation) until other teams got involved and they bumped up the price which we had no intention of matching, it was more the double our valuation in the end so if we weren't going to match that then fair enough. That seems to be the story in it's most basic form (it's what the Echo is saying anyways).

Like you said, we were probably going to wait until the summer to get him, the decision to do this would have been made after failing to settle on a price. After we did this though, other teams got involved, his price bumped up and then Chelsea came in and got him. If this is the case then this is the third time we've been in a similar situation and lowballing has cost us a player we wanted (Dempsey and Willian being the other two). If this is true then perhaps it's something that needs to be addressed.

Since it's a winger we've lost out on, the overall affect of this probably won't be too bad, it's still worrying though that we can't tie up some of these deals as if a similar situation occurred when signing the central midfielder we need then it could really cost us.

This is all based really on what's come out at the moment, there may be a few more details to emerge that change the story. I'm also no financial expert too so there's probably other circumstances in that regard that prevented the deal.

100% agree with what you say regarding the younger players and the point about their improvement is a good one, they'll be continuously improving in some way and over time will enhance the squad, some more than others and they'll be weeded out eventually but a year or two down the line is where we'll really see the benefit of this. 

I'm with you on getting a centre midfielder, we badly need one and should be going all out to get one, it's been a problematic area for us for too long. There's holes in the team that need to be filled and we're just another injury or two away in defense or midfield from it being a near crisis. We've our best chance in years to get back into the Champions League and the January window is a chance for us to really seize the opportunity to make a really good push for it. Solidifying that midfield would help us greatly.

I still think we'll see a player or two in the door before next week, the club isn't stupid and knows there's areas that need improvement now.

true,mahaneap,null,null,"I am a current 4th year CS student at Bristol. I can only answer about the CS half.

The languages we were taught in first year were. C, Java, Haskell, Verilog (I guess you'll do a lot more of that). That is enough to cover the main 4 paradigms - procedural, object-oriented, functional, weird electronsicy.

After that, they don't teach you languages. You'll discover that once you know Java, it's trivial to start using C#. Once you know C and the basics of object-orientation, you can do C++.

Most computer scientists I know really don't like Matlab. The engineers seem to love it though. In second year, we were required to use Matlab for one unit (Symbols, Patterns and Signals which I don't think CSE do), but we weren't taught it at all. It's basically just a case of learning the weird array notation, and remembering that arrays start at 1, not 0. Once you've done a bit of programming, you'll definitely be able to use Matlab yourself.

I would recommend coming to Bristol, but be warned that they will work you like a dog. Third and fourth year will take over your life. On the other hand, it does make working 9-5 afterwards seem easy.

I don't know much about CSE, but it is probably similar to CS &amp; Maths which is split 50-50 in the first 2 years, then more flexible in the 3rd and 4th years. CS do a group project in 3rd year and an individual project in 4th year. CS &amp; Maths do 1 CS project and 1 maths project, and can choose which way round to do them. If you find you don't like one of the subjects as much, switching between courses is quite easy if you do it early enough. You could easily change to straight CS or straight EE.

Don't worry about choosing between the 3 year and 4 year courses yet. In CS at least, you just decide at the end of second year which one you want to do. Although I've heard it's easier for student finance to switch you from 4 years of funding to 3 years, rather than the other way round. I would advise not doing the extra year unless you enjoy academia. I haven't really found any employers who prefer the MEng. I have a decent job for when I graduate, but there are plenty of people with the same job who only did 3 years.

If you want a proper student experience in your first year, go to Stoke Bishop or the two large Clifton halls (Manor and Goldney). Stoke Bishop is quite a long walk from the university though (and CSE students will be in the Merchant Venturers' Building (MVB) a lot, which is the furthest away from Stoke Bishop). There are a few newer halls in the city centre (Colston Street and several Unite ones), which look alright and are only about 10 minutes from the university. I would stay away Unite though. They will charge you a fortune in rent, threaten random fines, then make up damage to deduct from your deposit. I know a few people who lives in the Hawthorns, and they liked it. It seems a bit quieter than the big halls, and is in an incredibly convenient location.",0,1390568007,null,0,false,0,cexnykp,t3_1vypur,t1_cexnykp,t3_1vypur,null,1432086123,2,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,2

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; My argument is that those who are net consumers of public spending shouldn't have a say in how taxes they don't pay are spent.

But they will, one day, pay more in tax. They will pay for our pensions through their labour and their strife. They should have some say and influence in their lives are run and how their future will play out. 

You did not spring up and suddenly start paying tax; you went through a process and a system that allows you to pay what you pay now.  Like it or not you owe everything you are to that system, you depend upon others. 

Your premise also acts like we live in a bubble where what people are paid is proportional to the amount they contribute; this isn't the case. The highest paid people I know that are around my age made all their money speculating on useless crap like Bitcoins and trading cards and do practically nothing else. They *should* pay more tax than other because the only way they're able to do this is because there is a system that exists to support their lifestyle. 

You shouldn't be taxed without being represented, but, likewise, you shouldn't be excluded because that tax is spent on you. 

For example. If unemployed people all suddenly got jobs asset inflation would go through the roof. We that are lucky enough to profit from assets, thus, *benefit* from the unemployed.

I think OP is right when he says Oscar is a more 'complete' player than Mata, but going by that reasoning, O'Shea would be the most complete player in the world. That doesn't count for much. Mata makes goals, he was involved in a third of our goals last season. I'll argue that in a team with 6 other players whose sole job is it to defend, Oscar's influence should be able evaluated mostly on his playmaking capabilities. 


There is more to the bad days argument than OP presents. Yes, on his bad days Mata can disappear from the game and offer nothing in either attack or defense, but Oscar's bad days are worse. He gives away the ball a lot. And Mata has fewer bad days than Oscar.

 The only argument we really need here is the fact that Mourinho is the manager and he knows what he wants. He's not judging a Mata vs Oscar talent show, and he's made it perfectly clear that everthing he does  is with the long term interest of the club at heart, and he's not too worried about the short term. As a Chelsea fan who trusts in Mourinho's ability to do his job, that is enough for me. 

The only issues I have with this transfer has to do with the destination. I still think it's a possibility that Jose and the board underestimated how much this move would piss off the fans. It's not their job to protect our feelings, but unhappy fans can make for a pretty quiet stadium, and that effect can cause us some points.

Also, it's possible that the board has a wrong idea about why Man U wants Mata. Their reasoning could be the same as what the pundits are saying: that Mata is a marquee signing, he's there to express intent. This may not be that simple. United's traditional rigid midfield and wing play strategy has largely failed this season.
With Mata in one of the wings, they have another dimension to their attack. Also, Rooney is not a midfielder, he's a striker. And he enjoys playing the number 9 position more than the number 10, so giving them the leading assister in the league may actually make Rooney want to stay at United rather than leave. So in essense, we may have inadvertently help them keep Rooney, and given the reports about him negotiating a contract extension, that seems to be the case.

My hope right now is that Mourinho hears about the Rooney contract talks, realizes that is contrary to his intention and gives someone in Spain or France a call offering then a special 'we hate United' discount on Mata.",0,1390569013,null,0,false,0,cexo6j4,t3_1w0pia,t1_cexo6j4,t3_1w0pia,null,1432086248,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

To state Mata has a few more attributes but Oscar is better tells me how flawed and how much of an understanding he has in regards to playmakers and attacking midfielders.

I don't listen to others in regards to opinions on players (if this was the case, I would of disliked Drogba before we won the Champions League like most of the Chelsea Glory Hunters). And if you don't know what I'm talking about here, before we won the CL, Drogba was seen as a slow ""should retire"" striker by most pundits and many fans

Alright, back to Mata. Mata is not comparable to anyone in the League, he's a one of a kind player that does have something unique that will be shown when he joins the United (and for those who watched us consistently with Mata, you know exactly what I'm talking about). Comparing the two is like comparing Pirlo and Pogba, Paul Scholes and Anderson, or Ozil to Modric, they might be midfielders, and they might all be able to attack, but they are VERY different players with very different abilities within teams.

Juventus could sell Pirlo and replace him with a faster, stronger midfielder, Roma could replace Totti with a faster player also, but did they? Of course not, why? Because not only have these players deserved the respect they have within the team, they bring to the table a unique ability to connect the team together (corners, freekicks, assists, and even clinical finishing), even if they are much slower.

Let me add, I'm part Egyptian, so I should be fucking ecstatic with Salah joining the team, and you know what, he's a brilliant player, he's potentially one of the best young players currently and has the ability to become something special (and so did Mido, but we know what happened to him). But for Salah to be seen as a replacement to Mata is wrong, Salah could replace Oscar or Schurrle, but Mata? That's not a replacement, and they shouldn't be compared as one.

I'll leave you with this, because I watched every single one of these games, and I know what kind of player he is, but for those who don't watch many games, here's one of the best highlight reels you'll see of Mata.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnRP_AcBi4

He was a great player, he WOULD of become a Chelsea great if it wasn't for Mourinho, but he has his player favourites for whatever reasons and that's been clear to see since he joined (De Bruyne, Schurrle not getting enough time on the field also), but I'll leave it as that. 

I wish Mata the best, I can't say I'll support him within United as I really hate United, but as an individual, as a professional, he was my favourite player at Chelsea (I actually wasn't fond of him when he first joined due to his ""weakness""), but once you see what he offers, it's a no brainer.

I think he's bang on about another deal in the works, otherwise selling to United for under £50million is a very weird and undervalued transfer.

Well, for a start:

The copyright term needs to be *drastically* reduced, life + 70 years is absurd, for many reasons. In my opinion it needs to be on the order of 10-15 years (as it was when copyright was first introduced).

The ability to remix, sample and mash-up works is virtually non-existent, even where this does not impact (or, indeed, positively impacts) on the ability for the original authors to commercialise their work. Additionally, parody and satire are hugely effective tools for commenting on society and affecting change (aside from their intrinsic value as works).

The ability for one to use the media that one has supposedly bought is curtailed. Making backups of DVDs or CDs is unlawful for instance, as is copying material you ""own"" from one device to another (e.g. from your PC to your phone).

Circumventing DRM is unlawful, even when you do it so that you can utilise your (very limited) fair dealing rights.",0,1390570023,null,0,false,0,cexof6q,t3_1vz2qx,t1_cexof6q,t1_cexn86b,null,1432086337,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As an industry insider I can back OP's comments on the strength of the regulations within the UK Oil and Gas industry. Whilst the technology used is essentially the same, the way the industry is structured here will mean that a situation such as present in North Dakota (for example) where you have an almost wild west situation with 'Mom n Pop' frack companies operating with disregard for regulations will not occur.

As far as earthquakes are concerned I am not overly well informed on this; but the UK has a long history of small magnitude quakes caused by industrial activities (see the recent quakes in North Ollerton).

Obviously it is undesirable to have to shift to a new fossil fuel and I too would much prefer a shift towards more renewables and nuclear energy, for now however this appears to be a stop gap to halt a growing energy crisis in the UK.

I believe the biggest issue with fracking will not be water pollution or earthquakes but just the annoyance of increased traffic and noise levels in previously quiet areas of the country.

PS: I have 18 months experience working offshore in the UK (so not a lot) and am actually moving out of the industry so have nothing to gain from widespread fracking.",0,1390570046,null,0,false,0,cexofdp,t3_1v53hs,t1_cexofdp,t3_1v53hs,null,1432086338,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Agreed; but do you seriously think that that is the case in general?  You don't honestly think that every Pakistani is a terrorist do you?  You've also changed tack completely -- a minute ago we were altering our behaviour because of political correctness, now you say it's out of fear?

If you're honestly afraid of everyone who is from a middle-eastern country, then I am genuinely sorry for you.  I think you've been sold a bum wrap by the media.  My experience, and I grant that it is not vast, is that every non-British person I meet is, in the end, just like every other person.

&gt; But one where we must censor our actions to ""respect"" faith is a lie. 

I don't know about that.  I wouldn't censor my actions generally.  But I refrain from doing a full 15 minute rant about atheism to every Christian I meet.  Is that self-censorship?  I've heard a lot of people use the phrase ""I'm just being honest""; but where do you draw the line on that?  ""You're a big nosed ugly freak.  I'm just being honest"".  ""That dress, or any other is not going to hide the fact that you're a giant fatty.  I'm just being honest"".

&gt; What makes it worse is when we then see our government using such excuses to apply increasingly draconian laws in the name of terror prevention. 

Here we are in absolute agreement.  Personally I am more afraid of my government than I am of terrorists.  That can't be right.  In the name of preventing the highly unlikely, relatively low impact (I'm trying not to be facetious here, but relative to the number of people killed in say, road accidents, terrorism is completely negligible) events, governments seem to be willing to restrict high-occurance parts of our lives.

I was chatted up by one once. It was in the middle of Sauchiehall St, and Glasgow was experiencing one of those flash flood rains. I was caught completely off guard in a thin coat and luckily a chugger was near by with a massive umbrella. She coaxed me over and we had a long chat about thunderstorms in films and what they mean. Ended up on a date, but she turned out to be a bit of a *charity case* ho ho ho. (Just kidding, we went for coffee and it turns out she was nice, but we weren't into the same things.

Another chugger I ran into was when I had just ran into an ex of mine. She was one of those ex's from my teens, so it was a bit unsettling to see her in the real world after so much time. I was with a friend and we walked almost right into the chugger. I was so confuddled by my ex and my friend was *insistent* that he wanted a badge that I ended up signing up to give £5 per month to save the children. He got the badge and was happy.

Cue a week and a bit later and I wander downstairs from my flat into a massive flat party with dozens of people dancing to shitty techno played by some DJ in the living room. I walk into the kitchen to pilfer some drink, and there's my chugger! She's leaning over the kitchen counter, snorting a line of coke off of a chopping board. I tapped her on the shoulder and said, ""If you work on comission, you owe me a line.""

Let me give you an example of why you SHOULD be aware of the Danish debate and where your laws come form and some of the reasons for drafting them.

Basically what you're arguing is the law is equally applied to everyone and thus it's not a question of colour. 

Fine, look at the prison population of the US - it's overwhelmingly African American. Why is that ? Well research shows its a toxic mix of poverty, life chances and institutional biases in the legal framework. The law is weighted towards the white and the wealthy because of advantages that the white population has accrued and the disadvantages in African American communities. So on paper the law seems equal - in the way its implemented and manifest it is obviously not. 

The same can be said for voter ID laws. Why is the conservative base in the US so determined to push voter ID laws , because they know that voter ID laws will affect African American populations adversely and bake off the progressive advantage in that community. 

Does the voter ID law state that it should be aimed at African Americans - no because that would overt racism thus illegal and morally unjustifiable. However framed as a ""Voter fraud"" issue it's quite possible to achieve the affect of disenfranchising the African American vote and thus institutionalizing racism. 

So where does this affect the UK and why do I use the Danish example. 

Here's an academic paper on the matter (http://sprc.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Helena-Wray-Denmark-article-published.pdf)

In Denmark the majority of the immigrant population is in the poorer areas of the country. This is a European wide pattern, you have the same in Sweden, France , Belgium the UK etc. The reasons are pretty straightforward, a lot of workers came over when Europe was rebuilding and this was added too by various refugee populations. 

Now let's say you're an anti-immigrant party like the Danish Progress party,  and you see what the Right has successfully done with Voter ID laws and drug laws in the US - without seeming to be overtly racist  - then immigration laws are perfect.  

The Progress party knew that the majority of non-white immigrants were going to fall below a certain income bracket. They also knew that as long as they met the EU criteria for free movement that it would be legal. The statistical chances of catching someone who is non-white and is very low, and even if they did catch a white American or two in the criteria then it would make them seem fair and not racist. 

Also, they could play into an old right wing fear of - ""they come over hear and take our resources"". The stereoptypical vision of the immigrant being on the make ( sound familiar?) , having too many babies ( ohh look deja vu) and not keeping to ""our culture"" (funny hear that a lot round here too) was something they were quite happy to farm.  

As a policy it became phenomenally successful in what it aimed to do - which isn't really curbing immigration, it was about targeting non-white immigrants in Denmark.  

Why does that affect us - well the Conservative Party share an EU voting block with the Danish Progress Party. David Cameron actually moved his party from the Christian Democrat block into this block. 

At the same time a lot of the columnists and writers who work for several Tory think tanks/ Right wing newspapers were freely engaging with members of the Progress Party on the issue. It also became a massive topic on Tory blogs. It also traveled further to places like Australia where Lynton Crosby and the conservatives there also picked it up. 

Thus what we have now is a system that has institutionalized the denial of rights to a large immigrant population who are citizens by virtue them being on the wrong end of a statistical probability  and it's been done with knowing nod to the fact that this will be the case.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"You posted a good theory but we didn't revive United in fact United reviving to the extent of being 1st will not happen next season. This is because :

1) City is too strong for United to catch up to in 1 year year with or without Mata.

2) Chelsea is too strong for United to catch up to in 1 year with or without Mata.

3) Manchester United were not 1 Juan Mata away from a Champions League spot, they are also not 3-4 players short of a Premier League winning squad for next season because they are much much worse. Not only do they have to fill the gaps they already have but they will have to drive out an aging squad as well as keeping barely above average players on the sheet which only SAF can get with to the top of the table.

It is financially impossible for United to fix this squad for next season given their squad list to challenge for the title. FFP was created for us but its going to fuck them in the arse.

If United get the Champions League spot this season they will do it on their own because their entire team's attitude will have to change and Mata alone will not be responsible for it. If they win the next couple of matches with great new morale then it will be down to Mata but what happens when the honeymoon period passes if Moysey has the same run of results which is the more likely scenario? Their squad is worn out and it will take a lot of rebuilding, they do not have the manager to do it. Moyes might be a great manager and a great value for money talent finder but he will take a lot longer than Jose and managers like him to quickly get the players needed and improve the team tenfold over a season because his mentality is doing it the slow and calculated way. 

4) The Champions League revenue is important to them but at the same time they can still sign players without it due to their FFP position being better. Also with or without a champions league squad if United clear their aging squad and make room while in the Europa league and announce they are rebuilding it, top players will still sign for them. They were the champions just a season ago and have a history good enough that anyone will love to get a place in a big team and restart that.

Now for the Mata theory you posted.

- We do not know the other end of this deal and it could be anything. What we do know is that something is being hidden if Rooney goes to United or else this deal is going to fall flat on it's face and Mata still goes to PSG because what better will Roman and Jose want than to embarrass United further.

- If the other part of this deal exists then you have to take that into account for United's next season as well. Maybe they lose Rooney or maybe they make another deal that weakens their squad. 

- Mata will play good for United but he will still not offer enough to fix their problems. I can even see Kagawa still getting playtime even though their fans are saying he is to be sold now. They just shelled out money on a position they had such a top prospect in already, this was one of the least of their worries. If United are caught on the counter who saves them? Who runs that extra yard to stop 2/3 of the goals they concede from the mid? Just look at the goals from last game and how average they looked when we scored, how does Mata change that? You simply cannot add attacking players to counter for conceding goals because you'll be running into teams every odd week who will shut your scorers and creators out while dishing out goals left right and center. They technically replaced Kagawa so are they now going to replace Fellaini next? That is actually discouraging for anyone joining them.

As for Rooney I don't even want Rooney that badly. I think we can do better because Rooney has been on a decline and I think his best form is gone. Sure he is better than our strikers but we need to aim higher and look at the long term. He will be 29 when he joins us and will demand 250k a week. Why not just try Lukaku or even if we get another high profile striker why not someone else but him who has a couple of years on him so we can build the squad around them instead of another short term solution?

You have to remember that if we straight up swapped Mata and Rooney and both played average, we would still be considered the losers of the deal exactly like the Carrol-Torres deal. Even though both failed we were the laughing stock because we paid more, this time we will be the laughing stock because the midfielder can squeeze under the radar while another highly paid Chelsea striker not doing good enough? we'd be slaughtered.

As for Rooney signing a new contract it might not happen as that has been rumored even before the Mata deal came into play. 

I really am not worried about United not this season and not the next but I am worried about what the other side of this deal is and if this is a calculated risk taken by Jose. I want to see this play out because right now its all just predictions but I can see a silver lining to it and I'm very excited for our future, excited enough that I can see us winning 3-0 next time instead of giving up the clean sheet.

Forget about United, worry about City.

A testament to how good he was, and how much Rafa loved using him within his preferred system, is that Sissokio's form in the 2005-06 season (when we beat West Ham in the FA Cup, the year after winning the Champions League) and Rafa's preference for playing him in a double pivot alongside Xabi Alonso resulted in Gerrard's infamous phase as a right-sided midfielder -- when he won PFA Players' Player of the Year and had one of his best seasons statistically. 

Throw Mascherano into the mix, and Stevie could barely get a game in central midfield that season -- which was probably for the best, since Rafa loved a defensively airtight midfield and Gerrard was able to offer so much more going forward.

This is the exact opposite of what Carney wanted.

He has had to climb down and has lost face as a result. To say that this is planned and went as designed is IMHO nonsensical.

This policy error has costs. A period of rising GBP is to their minds bad for exports. Plus next time Carney wants to make a medium-term policy play the markets will find him less credible.

There is a large disparity between what is expected from a host nation.

But when the reverse situation is applied and UK or European visitors visit the middle east; we're still expected to respect their culture up to the point of abandoning your own culture in fear of death.

Fact of the matter is banks are still private organisations, for all the power they have, and as they're subject to money laundering and fraud regulations, they have an incentive to make certain that nobody's committing fraud or laundering money through the services they provide.

As they're private organisations, your bank could drop you tomorrow if it decided, for almost no reason, and they get the choice of whether or not to allow you to obtain a bank account in the first place. Other countries suffer from this to a great extent, with significant amounts of people unable to access banking services at all.

The most obvious solution is to fold the banks into the Government system, which would then mean they couldn't investigate us without good belief that we are engaging in criminal activity (in theory). This is, of course, a ridiculously poor idea. Giving the Government almost complete control over what I can spend my money on sounds like the beginnings of a dystopia.

&gt; 2) Chelsea is too strong for United to catch up to in 1 year with or without Mata.

This is debatable, many people thought Arsenal lacked a striker, lacked a lot of depth to even challenge the 4th spot. They just got Ozil and look at them, they are 2 points ahead of us.

Manchester United are a lot richer than Arsenal, when RvP, Fellaini, and Rooney are not injured, and you add to them Mata, another left back and another central midfielder which I know they will manage to get in the summer. We're looking at a scary team. 


&gt; You have to remember that if we straight up swapped Mata and Rooney and both played average, we would still be considered the losers of the deal exactly like the Carrol-Torres deal.

I've never wanted this, but I can be honest and say that if we managed to get Rooney, and make him take a paycut that would soothed my wounds about this deal.


In the end, I just hope Mata doesn't fire Man Utd to the 4th place, they are only 6 points behind it, and I hope Everton, Pool or even the Coys take the CL revenue, they don't have the potential to be as scary as United.

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"Here's a good guide from Tor on how to get into watching the classic series:

http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/07/how-to-who-on-starting-to-watch-classic-doctor-who

There are many contradictory lists of ""best"" or ""essential"" episodes. It really depends on what you consider essential. For example the Fourth Doctor serial ""Underworld"" provides some really good explanation of the Time Lords early interaction with another race (the Minyans of Minyos), how it went wrong, and as a result how the Time Lords developed their policy of non-interference. It also touches on how they gave a form of regeneration technology to the Minyans. All of this is great background information, but the serial itself is pretty difficult to watch. It involved some new at the time method of adding characters to backgrounds that is pretty bad by today's standards, it had garish colors, and there were some pretty weak portions of the overall serial. So, not likely to be something you would want to watch.

I might suggest a reverse viewing method from present into the past.  First start with the 1996 TV ""Doctor Who: The Movie."" It had generally better special effects than the classic series. It is also the main appearance of the Eighth Doctor on video (except for the new ""Night of the Doctor""short). The CGI sequences of the Master in a different form are going to suck though, CGI was pretty weak then.

Next, drop back into the Seventh Doctor's run. I think two of the best episodes to watch there are ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" and ""Curse of Fenric."" The Sixth Doctor might be your next stop. ""Vengeance on Varos"" and the ""Trial of a Timelord"" series/season are some highlights.

&gt; Agreed; but do you seriously think that that is the case in general? 

I dont think it is true for every case, but where religion, particularly Islam is involved I do think that Western outlets are more muted. The obvious example being the [Danish cartoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy) event of a few years back.

&gt; The cartoons were not reprinted in any major newspapers in Canada,[84] the United Kingdom,[85] or many in the United States[86] where articles covered the story without including them.

For me that is a good example of not doing something out of fear of reprisal. Let me put it this way, would the same international response have happened to something similar with Jesus? I sincerely doubt it.

&gt; You don't honestly think that every Pakistani is a terrorist do you? 

No, I know many and they are people like any other

&gt; You've also changed tack completely -- a minute ago we were altering our behaviour because of political correctness, now you say it's out of fear?

That was someone else not me. This is my first post in this thread.

&gt; If you're honestly afraid of everyone who is from a middle-eastern country, then I am genuinely sorry for you.

I'm not. I have travelled through North Africa and the middle east to a decent extent, as far as it goes I quite like the place. But my individual feelings do not necessarily reflect that of the wider UK population and they certainly dont reflect institutions that may be targeted because of their actions. 

Salman Rushdie (sp) is another example of someone who was targeted for writing a book. I can understand why he was/is afraid! 

&gt;  But I refrain from doing a full 15 minute rant about atheism to every Christian I meet. Is that self-censorship?

On a day to day basis, no. It'd be daft to do it every time you met someone but there are fora where we can have those debates, If those places started closing down out of ""respect"" or if you were threatened with violence because you held those belief then what?

&gt;  I've heard a lot of people use the phrase ""I'm just being honest""; but where do you draw the line on that?

This is where I agree with America. You should have the freedom to say what you want. But then people should have the common sense to ignore the idiots, and forgive me for getting biblical, but *turn the other cheek*. Seriously, people need to stop looking for reasons to get butthurt and just move on with their petty lives.

&gt; Is that really true? I've yet to see this supposed threat that says ""cancel Christmas or you will be bombed"". Where do you get that from?

No, but Salman Rushie and others have been targeted for their actions. 

&gt; Personally I am more afraid of my government than I am of terrorists.

I agree with you, but I do have some sympathy with the government. If they dont take enough actions they get blamed for not doing enough. If they do too much then they are inviting Big Brother style laws. You can't please everyone.

And yes you're right if we spent as much on car safety as we do on anti-terrorism then we'd all be better off. Sadly, human psychology doesnt work like that.

&gt; there is nothing a government loves more than the taking of more power.

&gt; **If we could reduce [fertilisers and pesticides] through the use of GM, then we could not only make farming more sustainable in the long run**

That sentence is easily debunked propaganda. My main issue isn't with ""big agra"" per se—but that's a convenient means to smear me as a luddite—it's with that false assertion from a crooked for profit system that's not even solving a problem we have. Production is not an issue, distribution is the problem. You should read [Three Famines](http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/tom-keneally/three-famines-9781741668568.aspx).

&gt; More resilient crops leads to decreased use of such methods.

You totally don't understand biology in that case. Resilient **nutrient cycles** decrease this dependency—soil to plant to mouth to arse to soil—and you cannot have a more resilient crop persisting across generations because pathologies adapt. It's a Ponzi scheme. Likewise GM industrialists show an equal ineptitude for physics, namely a desire to ignore the law of conservation of energy and build a perpetual motion machine.

Equally absurd was: 

&gt; reduce the link between food and fuel prices making food cheaper for everyone else

You can reduce the link only when you don't need to drive food hundreds of miles or fly it in from thousands, then require a car to pick up the weekly shop. Farming is a totally broken system from soil to mouth, corrupted by secret agricultural grants, corrupted by abusive worker practices and in general a system still not recovered from the medieval Enclosures. Food should be essentially over abundant to the point of it being free at the point of use. Actually it is over abundant, it's just locked behind distribution practices akin to extortion while the rich keep land idle—golf courses comes to mind.

If you want cheaper food in the current system you'll need more than workfare and probably an expansion of the slavery that exists in the suppressed producer countries—again the problem is not technical but political. Unless you diversify by giving any the power to modify seeds (ie' the bio printer you thought I was taking the piss with) the centralisation and corruption of the food system is going to be worse. Alternatively redistribute land, bring food to communities, end CAP based market distortions, and stop militarising the world's bread baskets.

Fracking might be an interesting addition to agriculture as desperate farmers give in to ""market forces"" and then wells start failing in 30-50 years.

I don't believe them to be the same, but it would be difficult to codify the difference in impartial and well targeted legislation.

The practice of embedding reporters and journalists with military units has made it difficult to report on a war without descending into propaganda. If you doubt this, compare the reporting from the Vietnam war to that from the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The former was critical and fuelled anti-war protests, while the latter was much more sympathetic to the coalition, their armed forces and war aims.

The reporting, and the carefully selected video footage from the MOD, didn't portray the invasion as a ""holy"" war. It did portray the war in a sympathetic light, and encouraged people to support the armed forces. An opponent of the war, or an enemy of the US/UK, would surely find this about as objectionable as we find beheading videos.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I honestly think the biggest deal is that we don't have owners with horrendously deep pockets, or ridiculous revenue streams, and the current management aren't the type to happily piss away vast sums of money and hope it works. They're fine to spend, but they're cautious and they're only going to if they're fairly sure that it's going to give value for money. Their whole business model for running clubs is a carefully calculated and strategic one, and these things take time (and committees). 

John W Henry and Co are people who have built up their own fortunes through smart investment strategies and futures trading (JWH's parents were literally farmers). They're not like the Glazers or Sheikh Mansour, who were born into incredibly wealthy families, nor Abramovic who has money to the point where a few hundred million really isn't all that much. Our owners are neither rich enough nor the type of people to just say ""Oh, he seems good does he? Lets just chuck £15m on him then before anyone else can."" - they're careful with their money.

We can't compete with City, Chelsea or United in bidding wars because we need to be far more careful about keeping the club solvent. And it can work - Arsenal have been relatively successful over the last two decades despite their net transfer spend being pretty low, even if it does seem to frustrate their supporters at times. 

And honestly, I think I'd rather be fighting for 4th under the FSG administration, and occasionally missing out on key players as a consequence of spending money in a cautious and sustainable way, than irresponsibly spending our way to almost winning the league and then being on the brink of bankruptcy and financial collapse a few years later like we were under G&amp;H.

I (like many others) actually think that signing Mata is just the first piece in the *smaller* puzzle of shifting to a different play style. Our pursuit of Rooney's new contract also suggests that we might be moving in this direction, because many have claimed that Mata is being brought in as his replacement, but that doesn't *seem* to be the case.

Right now we are weak because many of our best players are being shoehorned into a wide-playing 442 system, which they *do not fit into*. A few adjustments - rather than a radical overhaul which is what some people think we need - and we could easily see a revitalised United side with more of our players playing in more comfortable positions. 

Not saying we'll be #1 next season by any stretch however. We've got a lot of work to do to catch up with City and yourselves.

There's a good chance that the shift away from using ""Christmas"" is a tacit nod of acceptance from all non-believers who really just don't give a shit.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;What I'm trying to say is that I see it as a shame that traditional UK culture and our way of doing things does bend - to the detriment of those who are part of it - in order to make space for others and the cultures they bring with them.

You've cited the situation where some organisations banned Christmas, and another poster has cited a situation where a headmaster took the decision to again ban Christmas. Not one of these examples indicates these actions were taken as part of some wider authority driven initiative. In fact in most cases where stories like these crop up they're shown to be either cases of misunderstandings and overreactions, misinterpretations of actual equality schemes and downright exaggerations. I personally have never worked for an organisation that banned Christmas despite working with many Muslims. While working for central government in fact it was one of my Sri Lankan, Hindu colleagues who routinely put up the Christmas decorations. We'd exchange secret Santa gifts and go for Christmas lunch and no protests were ever made.

There was a less celebratory mood in my subsequent private sector jobs but again, no banning of Christmas, Easter or any religious festival has ever been witnessed by myself.

In fact, as is always the case with these things, you'd be hard pressed to find people who *themselves* have ever been subject to this. I'm not calling the other guy a liar, but doesn't it strike anyone as typical that it's always someone the person knows and never them? It's almost as if it's all a little overblown as a real issue we should be worried about.

What it seems to ignore, as people run around trying to save Father Christmas, is that on the whole Britain is less religious. We're simply not going to church as we once did unless it's a wedding or funeral. I know for sure I haven't been to regular mass since my early teens. So maybe you're just seeing the natural apathy towards religious festivals and holidays that comes with a nation moving towards a more secular tradition.

Traditions change and it's futile trying to preserve something outside of your own control. You can Morris dance and  run around Maypoles and roll giant wheels of cheese down hills and whatever other quant English pastime you feel is dying out but you can't force anyone else to join in. And that's where it'll be lost, not because the government bans it.

true,NachoAverageChip,num42-away,,"ITT: people who don't watch strikers off the ball. Chich is *not* the same thing as Soldado. Chich is constantly pestering and moving around the defense - creatively. His movement could be what we need to solve our problems in the final third. Soldado gets more stagnant every week as his confidence dwindles. We either need a Chichirito type striker or we need Soldado to create off the ball.

EDIT: to add some more differences, Soldado will drop back into a midfield role at times. Chich very rarely does this, and never as deep as Soldado. It can be good thing dropping back for sure especially to play the ball wide for a cross. But keeping the pressure and making space for Eriksen and Dembele is a good thing too.

Soldado has had a lower and lower work rate as a subsequent response to lower confidence. Chich is the opposite, as his confidence lowers he gets more intense and works even harder. He's been offside like crazy lately for this reason. Being offside so much is a bad thing but it can have positive consequences - a defender can tell when they're beaten even if offside has been called or Chich doesn't get the pass his run deserved. This can help other players on the pitch when they adjust for Chich. Like I said he's a much more creative and pestering player off the ball than Soldado. He can end up drawing defenders like Bale did except now we have the quality around the pitch to really make teams pay.

If your bank charges £25 to send SWIFT transfers then the total cost will be £29 + 0.5% okpay fees. There will also be trading fees on btc-e when you send the funds there.. even worse btc-e only has USD and EUR denominated markets so you'll get stung for okpay to convert the GBP to USD or EUR (unless you buy bitcoins directly from okpay? but okpay is not an exchange - you just have to take or leave whatever price they offer and it probably won't be any cheaper).

Whereas if you sent a GBP wire to bitstamp the cost would be £25 (for the wire) + bitstamp's bank's fx rates to convert the GBP to USD and then the trading fees at bitstamp. This will work out much cheaper.

If you look around you might find cheaper options for sending SWIFT transfers too.. for instance the lloyds international offshore current account offers free SWIFT transfers. If you get a GBP account from them it will come with an account# and sort code so you can transfer funds via faster payments and then send them onward to bitstamp via SWIFT for free.. then take advantage of bitstamp's cheap GBP to USD conversion and you'll be paying very little to move money there.",0,1390577889,null,0,false,0,cexr0v4,t3_1vo5iu,t1_cexr0v4,t1_cexq880,null,1432087589,3,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,3

City do it right now with Fernandinho and Yaya Toure.

Unfortunately, I don't think we have the players to sufficiently achieve it. I don't think Henderson's defensive capabilities are good enough to 'sit back' while his box-to-box partner gets forward - he's essentially best suited to being paired with a true DM, or playing the ""Lampard role"" in a 3-man midfield. Allen could be one part of a double pivot, but Gerrard doesn't have the mobility to be the other part.

Examples:
- No mortgage arrangement fee
- Free valuation
- Cashback

On a £150k, 35 year term mortgage your repayment will be £710pcm at 4.5% = £17040 over 2 years.

On a 4.0% the same mortgage would be £664pcm = £15936 over 2 years.

Difference is approx £1100, which you could end up paying in fees for the 4%, but not the 4.5%.

Summary, its not all about the interest rate when you are looking at a short 2 year fixed term.

true,JonBStoutWork,lfc68,,"Red Sox Fans were that way in the 00s and 90s because they were right to be. History showed them not to get their hopes up.

There's a difference between being realistic and understanding the history and the teams involved and expecting disappointment. United and Spurs having better teams/squads/managers, finishing higher than us in the league, having a winning mentality, having more money, are some of the reasons that could be given for someone thinking that 4th place would be a major coup for us. (Not that it's all of them together, but a pick of a few). We might have a better manager than United, but not the spending power. We might have a bigger income than Spurs but not as big a squad etc.

Realistically speaking Spurs have a much stronger squad than us. United have the ability to go out and pay €40 million for a player, we don't.

It doesn't mean we haven't played well, or that we can't achieve 4th, it just means that it would still be a huge ask.

City and Chelsea will fight for the title. Arsenal might stay the course, might not. The reason for that is simply that they've the strongest squads. I'd argue the next strongest is Spurs followed by United and then ourselves.

After our first 13-14 players we struggle for any quality. United might get 15-16 then struggle. Spurs could get away with missing 5 or 6. Arsenal 7-8, whilst City and Chelsea could potentially miss 11 players and still have good enough back-ups to beat half the league.

We are now missing one of our key players for 2 months. We don't have a back-up for Lucas and as you can see by the Villa game, when he doesn't play, a slightly suspect defence is all over the place. They could have been 4 up on us.

Although Johnson wasn't playing amazing we're running out of defensive cover.

We lose any more players and we'll be struggling to stay with not just Spurs and United but Everton and Newcastle too.

Everton could have overtaken us last weekend with a win, that's how tight it is.

I'm delighted with how we're doing in the league, but it's partially because Spurs and United have been dreadful, if they stop being dreadful (which Spurs seem to have done) then we're in for a dogfight.

true,OldManDubya,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"I do agree with you - things like the Salman Rushdie affair are truly awful; the fact that an author (and such a great one too) had his life so badly affected by an interpretation of his book (A misinterpretation at that; for people who live their lives by a book the religious wingnuts seem to be very bad at textual interpretation).

But really, what more could the British government do than protect him? I agree it was sickening that the Archbishiop of Canterbury actually did agree that he should be prosecuted under very old blasphemy laws, but the government didn't follow him and that says more to me about the awkward position of this country in having an established church. 

So some British Muslims probably do think this country could do with a dose of Islamic law, or just think they should be allowed to impose it on the Muslim community (As I understand it the Koran does not require non-Muslims to adhere to it). Some people will always have those beliefs; as long as they don't persuade the majority, and they don't pursue their aim by violence, what's the big deal?

And is Islam the only thing people self-censor for? Look at the reluctance of the British Press to publishing those Kate Middleton pictures. Also, when I see someone like Geoffrey Bloom being shouted down for his comments about Bongo-Bongo land I sort of agree that what he says was stupid, and even if he turns out to be a prophet ahead of his time, shouldn't people who buck the norm expect to be shunned?

I think that's what annoys me about *certain* anti-PC obsessives; their really objection is to being criticised, not political correctness. 

That being said as a big fan of Mill's *On Liberty*, I do worry that our society seems sometimes to tend closer to the sort of ruthless conformity that Mill complained of in Victorian society. 

Though in general I think that some people self-censor too much, and the British government certainly has a long and dishonourable history of using the law to smack down free speech. I regard myself as a fully paid-up metropolitan liberal but I am uncomfortable with the fact some of our hate speech laws.

true,OldManDubya,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"A friend of mine from uni is working at an Academy school in Southwark as a Sixth Form helper; one of her main jobs is to help the kids with their university applications.

She was telling me that she has had trouble getting several of their parents to provide financial disclosures to allow them to get state aid for their studies because they're worried about their benefits being cut, and some of these kids have places at top universities. So yeah, they definitely sound more secure. 

The problem is - delusional as he is, I don't doubt IDS's zeal, but it the zeal of a sanctimonious Victorian. His sort of attitude is unlikely to actually help people.

Those advocating the reform of welfare have been telling lies - a welfare system that stops people from becoming trapped in welfare and which helps the socially excluded etc. to get back on track will doubtless be *more* expensive; welfare reform should not be a cost-cutting exercise if you really want to help people.

Whereas if it is the law itself that is barbaric (I agree absurd and draconian for the state to punish blasphemy), there are also many laws that we upheld that many would find barbaric (even if they are not directly comparable). Just to pick one, Britain's position on the issue of assisted suicide may well be regarded as barbaric by other countries that do allow for this practice. 

However I think that many give our nation the benefit of the doubt and attempt to understand the cultural and political context of our current laws, rather than simply saying we are backward.",1,1390584420,null,0,false,0,cexu3zw,t3_1w0wt7,t1_cexu3zw,t1_cexp9de,null,1432088979,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Most ""War on Christmas"" tabloid claims, at least in the UK, have had a tendency to be debunked relatively quickly - as shown by articles from both the [UK version of the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/12/04/politically-correct-christmas-myth_n_4382764.html) and [The Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/8220780/The-biggest-war-on-Christmas-myths.html), to take two sources from the first page of a quick Google search.

Aside from that, there seems to be this huge disparity between how people view themselves, and how they view other people, as is also represented within your post.

As mentioned by /u/kingofthejaffacakes, the fact that tolerance is ingrained as a UK national value (especially politically, as you can see by looking at the histories of prominent leftist and libertarian thinkers abound) is what makes it so appealing to everyone who ever wishes to migrate here. Even to most of the Pakistani individuals, it wouldn't be unreasonable to suggest that they likely think their country is a ""shithole"" regarding its intolerance. 

I will bring the name of this academic up when I remember them, as well as their statement/evidence, but I distinctly remember reading that, in the early 1900's, the Middle East actually revered the Western World for being ""more Islamic"" than their own countries, as a result of human and civil rights. On the contrary, the source suggested that, only following the 1979 Iranian Revolution that spurred on multiple other revolutions in the Middle East, did Islamic fundamentalism become an issue. I may need to /r/AskSocialScience or /r/AskHistorians before getting back to you on that.

The point I wish to make is, these people come here understanding that this is a tolerant country, and hoping that they'll be able to maintain their beliefs and live a peaceful existence in a developed and liberal environment. The reason that nationalist sentiments are ""lambasted"" as racist stems from the fact that it hopes to intrude on people's private lives (who are in abidance of the law), telling them how they should or should not live, or what they should or should not believe in.

Making threats to someone is very different from calling them a cunt, or like in some other cases - making offensive jokes, using offensive words.

I can go on twitter and call anyone I like a cunt, and I should be able to do that without fear of being arrested just because someone was offended. 

I should not be able to go on twitter and say I'm going to rape somebody because that is a threat.

When political historians are dusting off the gravestone of Lord Rennard’s Liberal Democrats, I doubt it will read “killed by feminism”.
BY LAURIE PENNY PUBLISHED 24 JANUARY 2014 12:10 
 

Lord Rennard isn’t saying sorry. The Liberal Democrat peer, who has been accused of multiple incidents of sexual harassment, could have saved a lot of fuss if he had just apologised to the women involved in his case – but he shan’t and he won’t, so he has been suspended. Rennard joins a dispiriting roll-call of powerful male politicians who have thrown public tantrums after being called to account for sexist behaviour.

You’d think that admitting wrongdoing and moving on might be a relatively easy task for any boy over the age of eight. When it comes to allegations of assault, harassment and rape, however, even the most respected professional men start acting like toddlers – screaming and lashing out, destroying every precious structure within reach and blaming the uppity women for making them do it. The Rennard case fits this pattern: some Lib Dem loyalists have claimed that the furore might “destroy” the party. Forgive me for paying attention to opinion polls, but in ten years’ time, when political historians are dusting off the gravestone of the Liberal Democrat party, I doubt it will read “killed by feminism”.

Across the political spectrum, women are being tossed under the bus of party positioning. This past week, we also got to watch Nigel Farage of Ukip tell business leaders in the City that women who take time off to have children are “worth less” to employers. The main message here is that social justice ought to bend to the needs of business – core Conservative territory that Farage is keen to stake out, proving to the City that Ukip does more than just incoherent xenophobia and odd weather forecasts.

The representation of women in party politics matters – and not just to politicians. I recently gave a talk on gender and social issues to a group of sixth-form students who were less than enthused about party politics but keen to talk about the dearth of women in government. Westminster’s hostility to women still sends an important message to the population at large.

It is not just about numbers. It is not just that young girls considering political work still see a parliament dominated by men. It is also that the few women who make it into those top jobs face relentless harassment – public punishment for their political ambitions – from the press, their peers and their colleagues.

The harassment of women in political office sends a message to the entire nation about what the role of women should be. In the late 1990s, Labour’s Harriet Harman was subjected to the sort of ridicule and public bullying that would put any bright girl off the idea of running for office. It was bullying that, whatever you think of Harman’s politics, remains as perfect a spectacle of political misogyny as the British elite have to offer. Over a decade later, Stella Creasy – also Labour – is as well known for being threatened and harassed online as she is for her campaigns against payday loan companies. And now Rennard would rather make his entire party look foolish and sexist than say a simple “sorry”.

Workplaces where the groping of women by high-status men goes unchecked are environments whose vectors of power are clear. Sexual harassment in general is not just about having your bottom pinched or your boobs squeezed on the sly. It is about having your bottom pinched and your boobs squeezed and being unable to say any­thing about it because the groper is an important man – and if you speak up, or reject his advances too loudly, it’s you who risks being called a lying slut and stonewalled out of the party. It is about a culture of silence that proves who has the power.

The Rennard affair calls to mind the collapse of the Socialist Workers Party, once Britain’s foremost far-left group, over a rape scandal last year. The SWP was unable to hold one of its leaders to account and unwilling to adapt to a world suddenly and uncomfortably full of women demanding to be treated with respect.

It is far from the only political party to have faced that challenge and faltered. When men on the political right harass women with impunity, that’s just traditional – like racist jokes or fox-hunting – but when men on the left harass women with impunity, it’s because to change their behaviour would be a distraction from the “Great Work”. Whatever the current Great Work is, from a global workers’ uprising to three years of waving through Conservative cuts and calling it compromise, somehow it’s always more important than women’s autonomy.

This is not just about “women in politics”. Politics does not end at the gates of Westminster but beats a path to every home and every heart. This is about a culture that continues to tell women that our autonomy does not matter, that our freedom is not important, that we must wait till after the revolution or until the next parliament for our silly little lady problems to be addressed – and meanwhile we should shut up and learn to take a groping like grown women.

No. Outside the world of party politics, more and more women are saying no. They are speaking out and refusing the posture of powerlessness – and if the old political order continues to fight that change, it will find itself skewered on the shards of its own privilege.

Granted their two midfielders are basically the perfect type of player for this: strong, athletic, and intelligent.  Still though, you can see that generally one of them is more disciplined and doesn't not drive onward, they go 1 at a time to supplement the attack.  Usually Fernanhindo is the one covering while Yaya bombs onward.

The way City attacks in the 4-2-2-2 under Pelligrini is just awesome to watch.  They're patient with the ball in possession, but they never switch off and never daudle.  The instant one of them thinks there could be something to exploit the entire team springs into motion together and it happens so fast that it's hard to react to.  You'll see Silva with the ball down the left after City were 30 seconds in possession, looking like slowing things down.  He'll play a little 1-2 with Yaya or Kolarov, looking like going nowhere fast and then suddenly Kolarov is overlapping off his shoulder, Yaya is storming forward from deep, Fernandinho is slotting in to cover Yaya's space and be available to recycle possession if needed (and then sometimes making a very late trailing run to the edge of the box if they fashion an extended chance or get themselves entrenched deep in the attacking third), the forward closest to the ball is checking to it, the other forward is taking the space left by the first one, and the opposite winger/AM is coming in towards the back post.  Silva (or Nasri, or Navas, or Aguero, or whoever has the ball) immediately has 4-5 clear and dangerous options to advance the ball into a deep area.  All at once, so fluid and fast.  and all of them follow up on their passes with intelligent movement, no one ever passes the ball and stands still.

One version is we're up and coming, made CL, have some extra cash to spend, and can demonstrate that we're moving forwards in a concerted manner with a view to future success.  

The other version is we don't back up our ambition with cash in the transfer windows, lose our best players because we can't produce on the pitch, don't play at the highest level of competition, and are a mediocre, mid-table team that is deceiving itself with notions of grandeur.

Making CL this season is incredibly important.  If we don't, we likely lose Suarez, and how we're viewed by potential signings is vastly different.  I don't think we make CL without a DM considering how thin the squad is.  We've got less than a week to make that happen, and I certainly hope a couple million pounds isn't the deciding factor because FSG don't value a player that highly and refuse to overpay in the slightest.",0,1390589049,null,0,false,0,cexwi22,t3_1w0v8i,t1_cexwi22,t1_cexnfth,null,1432090172,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I've dealt with two jobcentres, one in a relatively large town in a densely populated area (Stockton-on-Tees), and one in a small town which is quite a bit more rural (Guisborough).

I've had two completely different experiences with each. At Guisborough, i'm on first name terms with half of the staff and feel like they're there to help me rather than judge if i'm cheating the system. Sometimes I go in whilst passing just to have a chat with some of the staff (Unless it's busy, then I tend to leave it to the signing appointments).

At the Stockton job centre they went out of their way to make me feel guilty about claiming. Nobody would ever ask how I was, or treat me as a human at all. On more than one occasion I was warned up front about going on 'probation', before i'd even showed them the steps i'd taken to apply for jobs. At least, the staff who handled the weekly signings were like that, my advisor was alright but back then you were only assigned one after 6 months unemployed.

The latter was always much busier, so I guess it's dependant on the number of claimants they have to accomodate.

You have just used an awful lot of words to tell me that the main problem is distribution not production (I agree).

That current farming methods can lead to degradation in soil structure and productivity (I agree) and that GM will not solve this by itself (I agree).

When I referred to more ""resilient crops"" it applied to their resistance to pests, not their ability to withstand lack of nutrients. Using fewer pesticides is not a bad thing. Just because we are getting more out of the land, does not mean it isn't put back in. Crop rotation to maintain Nitrogen levels has been a thing in the UK for decades, as has muck spreading and the ploughing in of stubble. There is still work to do, you are right, but farmers do not blindly strip the land of bare and then wonder why nothing grows. There is no profit in a dust bowl.

&gt;reduce the link between food and fuel prices making food cheaper for everyone else

All I meant was that reduced reliance on petroleum based fertilizers though GM would reduce costs. Which it would. Whether that would be passed on to the consumer or kept by the supermarkets is an entirely different matter. I apologise for the poor wording of my statement.

GM is not the total solution to our many problems, but it is part of much wider changes needed in our global food chain.

Your comments about the militarization of agricultural regions, of companies having monopolies on seed production, of redistribution of land are all valid. But have little to do with GM. Things like this have happened way before anyone even thought about GM.

&gt;breaks the laws of physics, picks it self, delivers itself to the supermarket, and turns you into an X-man.

No one is claiming it will do that. It can improve the situation, it cannot solve it. The alternative development model is all very laudable and important, as is land redistribution, but they are not reasons to oppose the introduction of GM crops into the UK.",0,1390590680,null,0,false,0,cexxbph,t3_1w0iv8,t1_cexxbph,t1_cexq47a,null,1432090614,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Nine looks crazy, almost as if he had just destroyed his home planet including 2.5 billion children, hardly managing to cope with what he has done. Then ten, the one who regrets, has an almost disgusted and apathetic expression that I've sometimes seen Tennant use, which works nicely in terms of the remorse and shame he feels. Eleven, the one who forgets, has a dunce like quality, an innocent child like ignorance of youth. He has spent hundreds of years trying to forget the atrocities he believes he has committed. Spending centuries and lifetimes distracting himself, as he tries to run away from what he has done and who he was, unintentionally making himself younger after each regeneration. 

None of these qualities truly represent the Doctor, but a deep level of horror and regret could cause someone to see themselves in such a way when they look in the mirror. All three of these pieces have an almost cartoonish quality that exaggerates the darker side of what each incarnation might represent if any of the doctors had ever given in to the vice of the ninths insanity, tenths regret, or elevenths dismissal. Cleverness can be mistaken for insanity and regret mistaken for hopelessness. A willingness to forget is not stupidity, and the doctor is infinity clever and hopeful.

Arteta plays the pivot at Arsenal and at times this season they have played Flamini beside him. It worked well against Napoli; it was less effective against West Brom.

It's useless to harp on about needing a DM if there is little indication of signing one. Until Lucas is fit I would imagine that Allen, Gerrard and Henderson will make up the midfield.

Can you name a youth player we let go, who then went on to be a star elsewhere ?
I can't think of one.  If the youth were good enough they'd start, but while our youth team has been playing great, individually there hasn't been a lot of stars.  I do think Mcgregor, Henderson and Atajic can all buck this trend though, not to mention Calvin Miller, our superstar in the making.

Levy held modric for a season after his attempt to leave for Chelsea for 40million. Redknapp would have been slaughtered without the Croatian, since Luka ran the entire team. That was a gamble- modric went on to have arguably his best season with spurs, but it could easily have left us with a sour player. If Chelsea hadn't won the competition, it was a gamble that got us into the champs lge.

Madrid wanted bale, barca wanted neymar and Bayern wanted goetze. No one made a serious bid for Suarez (including arsenal, 40mill to a rival was never going to be enough). Liverpool didn't have to fight that hard to keep him. On the other hand, spurs were utterly bombarded all summer, and received 2 concrete bids of £85million and above. 

Sorry for the long text, but this kind of attitude really winds me up. Levy gets a lot of shit, but IMO his mistakes are generally around underbidding for new players (and missing out), not his attitude towards selling players.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"Some worthwhile excerpts:

On Criado-Perez:

&gt;She describes panic and
fear and horror. She feared the abusers would
find her and carry out the threats. She felt
hunted. She remembers feeling terror every ti
me the doorbell rang. She has had to spend
substantial time and money ensuring she is as untrackable as possible. She gives a detailed
and personal account of the physical effects of
the fear on her. The emails from Sorley
and Nimmo (she says) are imprinted on her mind – “I don’t think I will ever be free of
them”.

And Creasy:

&gt; The effect on Stella Creasy has also been substantial. She became concerned for her
safety to the extent that she had to alter he
r behaviour. She had a panic button installed
in her home.

The fact that they had this level of effect on two independent people makes me think it's much more likely that it was their behaviour rather than the victims' fragility.

Noteworthy aggravating factors (summarised):-

* Threats of death, rape and worse.
* Use of anonymity (and reference to being just out of prison) heightening fear and uncertainty about their capability
* Continued after being blocked and warned across multiple sites
* No concern about being reported to police - acted as if they were immune when threatened
* Sorley had 25 offences since November 2010, including two offences of assaulting a police officer and another of assault. She sent abusive tweets within hours of leaving court for one of those. [Note that impunity to previous punishment is a very common reason for longer sentences].
* Nimmo showed a lack of remorse

Her are some of the lovely tweets they sent...

Sorley:

* fuck off and die...you should have jumped in front of horses, go die
* I will find you and you don’t want to know what I will do when I do... kill yourself before I do
* rape is the last of your worries
* I’ve just got out of prison and would happily do more time to see you berried; seriously go kill yourself! I will get less time for that
* rape?! I’d do a lot worse things than rape you.

Nimmo:-

* Ya not that gd looking to rape u be
fine
* I will find you
* come to geordieland (Newcastle) bitch
* just think it could be somebody that knows you personally
* the police will do nothing
* rape her nice ass
* could I help with that lol
* the things I cud do to u
* dumb blond bitch

Honestly, I think this is entirely justified. If they were doing this to somebody who was themselves anonymous then it would just be deeply unpleasant and sustained harassment/'trolling'. The fact that the victims didn't have the benefit of anonymity while the perpetrators did makes this a pretty terrifying situation, IMO.

Well that's the thing, we should doing this anyway. We are spending more than we have, and we will have to address this concern in either eventuality. The argument is it would be easier as an independent country rather than under a political system so enthralled to the City and picking up the proportionally larger debts of Wales and Northern Ireland. With independence, it is argued, the government would be able to institute policies designed specifically for Scotland, that would be far more effective. 

&gt;How is that going to affect the man on the street?
 
As I have said, smaller democracies are, as a rule, usually more accountable. The Scottish population is outnumbered by the English one nearly ten to one; it has been claimed that the Scottish vote has only affected the outcome of the general election 3 times since the end of WWII. This will naturally give the common man a greater say in who represents him on the world stage and who governs him; and if he is forced to give things up due to decreased spending and higher taxes it is more likely to be because he *has* to, rather than because those on top have decided he *should* do.

&gt;The only winners will be a new Scottish elite who will emerge to skim-off-the-top of all those juicy government contracts.

This is exactly what I am talking about. Yes the team has flaws but so do these teams. 

The Spurs don't have a stronger side then us. they have an utter lack of impact players. What LFC fans seem to ignore for some reason is that Suarez vs the average player is a bigger difference then any player in the league. Sturridge is one of the top attacking players in the league also. Plus Central Forwards have a bigger impact on outcome then any other position in the league other position. It's possible Totenham may be marginally superior in some area's but it's cannot make up the difference of LFC being vastly superior in others, especially when all the info suggest the rest of the two squads are pretty similar. There is simply no way a team that's at a 0 goal differential is more talented then one at +23. 

The Spurs stats all suggest they should be 8-14 points beyond us with average fortune. They are amazingly lucky to be where they are. They could massively improve over the rest of the season yet easily not keep up their points per game.  

Whilst United have played simply not shown at all this year they are capable of playing the 7 points better then LFC over the end of the remainder of the year.

Nevertheless, to merely say Scotland is subsidised because it receives above average per captia spending is a narrow view, you have to look at how much money these areas *generate*. 

Scotland contributes 9.9% of the UK's taxes (£56.9 billion) and receives 9.3% of government spending (£64.5 billion). Now, whilst this means that, *proportionally* Scotland receives less than it puts in, but *by amount* has a £7.6 billion spending deficit, or 13.4% of it's tax income.

*However*, the UK (including Scotland) runs a spending deficit of £108 billion a year, or 17.6% of UK tax income. Without Scotland, the UK runs a deficit of 18.1% of tax income. Then one can take into account ""hidden costs"" of Union, such as Scotland paying interest on a national debt largely run up by England, which has been calculated by some to be as much as £64 billion over 30 years. However, no one is entirely sure how much these ""hidden costs"" amount to altogether.
I am uncertain as to how the North Sea oil revenues plays into all this, whether they are included by my figures or not, but be wary that most UK government figures do not include North Sea oil revenue when taking account of Scotland's finances.

I had heard of a report from the Office for National Statistics claiming Scotland contributed as much as it was given, but I had also heard that due to an error some of their data regarding Scotland was incorrect, I do not know if that report was invalidated because of that, or if all my data is still accurate.

That might be because I'm not opposition to GM, I opposed to the rhetoric, expectation and faulty science. Likewise the whole corrupting of the political process as US companies extort favourable legislation through underhand tactics as revealed in the Wikileaks cables and elsewhere.

&gt; Crop rotation to maintain Nitrogen levels 

Carbon? Magnesium? Sulphates? Correct ph levels. Carbon is essential for soil fertility as it acts like a coral reef for all manner of organisms, controls moisture content, and deep rooting plants transfer nutrients in symbiotic relationships.

&gt; reduced reliance on petroleum based fertilizers though GM would reduce costs

I fail to see study in this regard; theoretically it seems almost certain. The studies of course is about the golden egg like this submission: ""nutrient enriched"".

&gt; There is still work to do, you are right, but farmers do not blindly strip the land of bare and then wonder why nothing grows. There is no profit in a dust bowl.

Texas. Ancient Greece. The so called fertile crescent (today's middle east). If I remember correctly the Yellow River wasn't always yellow as deforestation lead to increased erosion and thus sediment flow. In the UK I believe moorland and the scrub land used now for sheep are equivalents to Iraq's barren land scape. Farmers practicing agriculture have done nothing but exhaust fertility on a long enough time line for thousands of years. Agriculture would have failed without being juiced by cheap oil. That has ended.

&gt; It can improve the situation, it cannot solve it.

That's precisely incorrect. If one believes distribution is the problem GM in it's current form will have zero impact at best, a negative impact at worst. GM will not improve nutrient intake, it will not increase food security.

&gt; but they are not reasons to oppose the introduction of GM crops into the UK.

Plenty reason. Empowering the abusive companies further is immoral and without hyperbole an existential threat. This technology really needs a popular resistance until the socio-economic environment isn't ruled by psychopaths in person or as business constructs operating without empathy totally focused on control. Beyond that the likes of Monsanto have a history of genocide, [population control](http://www.population-security.org/28-APP2A.html#VI) and eugenic practices. Most importantly GM is a solution to a problem we don't have, so why isn't pushed as a saviour? I suspect GM companies are going to want to protect their so called ""intellectual property"" by focusing on infertile seeds. We see that already as they sue neighbouring farms who have unwittingly had the crops hybridised. Elsewhere studies are prevented from happening because corporations deny access to the seed stock for independent study.

From what I remember it was regarded as a knee-jerk reaction from parliament that wasn't really necessary. I have been doing some research on the matter this evening and the UK never had a gun crime problem before 1997, much like other places in the world.

[""Switzerland trails behind only the U.S, Yemen and Serbia in the number of guns per capita"" ... ""Yet, despite the prevalence of guns, the violent-crime rate is low: government figures show about 0.5 gun homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. By comparison, the U.S rate in the same year was about 5 firearm killings per 100,000 people, according to a 2011 U.N. report.""](http://world.time.com/2012/12/20/the-swiss-difference-a-gun-culture-that-works/)

So there is definite proof that easily accessible firearms does not necessarily lead to a rise in gun crime.

The real question is, how would the UK culture react to reintroduced hand guns? I can only see it working if:

1) You were not allowed to carry them in public.

2) Advertising would be heavily regulated to avoid glorifying them much like the US has done.

3) Obtaining a license would involve rigorous background checks.

4) Owning a hand gun without a license warranted high fines and/or jail time + lifetime ban.

Also, from looking at the [Firearm Crime Statistics from Parliament.co.uk](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;ved=0CFkQFjAK&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.uk%2Fbriefing-papers%2Fsn01940.pdf&amp;ei=2djiUsTHLoWw7Abem4CoBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGH6atVDylpEjVwNHfABXpLQLKybg&amp;sig2=hcs6Q2GYBKMPOgC7EtECRA&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.ZGU&amp;cad=rja) you can see that gun crime actually rose from 1997 to 2004, only to fall back to pre-ban levels in 2011 [(pic for the lazy).](http://i.imgur.com/0FQe3yo.png)

Rather than label all gun ownership as bad, it really depends on where you live and the culture surrounding them.

true,dontgoatsemebro,null,null,"I don't think you fully grasp the magnitude of the deficit between tax revenue and spending in Scotland. If you think taxes need to be raised *now,* you're going to be in for a serious surprise in a decade or two.  
  
Scotlands non-oil tax revenues are £8,200 per head, while spending is £11,400 per head. It doesn't get much more clear cut than that, there's a 30% discrepancy. An independent Scotland would need to either almost double the size of its economy (...) or it ***must*** make ***massive*** public spending cuts and raise taxes in equal measure.  
  
Scotland could implement cuts now and save all it's oil revenue to tide it over until it can work out a way to almost double the size of its economy. But let's be realistic that is a fairly ludicrous task in itself, under massive austerity it would be impossible.  
  
As for the cuts; The biggest cost is health and pensions. Healthcare will need serious reform, universal healthcare would definitely be up for the chop, privatisation would really be the only solution given electoral opposition to the former. Pensions are second in line, and for all intents they would have to be scrapped. You're looking at a 15 year increase on retirement age to make any serious dent. Education; free tuition would obviously need to be scrapped. Local spending in Scotland is already in dire straights, with 85% coming directly from central government the cuts required there are going to be devastating to communities.  
  
Back to reality though... none of these absolutely essential changes would be implemented. No party would dare privatise healthcare, or raise the retirement age by fifteen years, or instate tuition fees, or raise taxes 40%... Scotland will churn along until the oil revenues drys up and it burns through any cash reserves and the country is left utterly bankrupted. At which point, reunification will become an economic and political necessity. The only difference will be that Westminster will in a position to dictate absolute terms.

true,Number-6,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"Interesting you say that, they reserve the offence of an improper use of phones/internet i.e a communications network (which they were charged under) for a reason.

This is under: **The Communications Act 2003 section 127,** 

&gt; Section 127(1)(a) relates to a message etc that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character and should be used for indecent phone calls and emails. Section 127(2) targets false messages and persistent misuse intended to cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety; it includes somebody who persistently makes silent phone calls (usually covered with only one information because the gravamen is one of persistently telephoning rendering separate charges for each call unnecessary).

&gt; If a message sent is grossly offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing or false it is irrelevant whether it was received. The offence is one of sending, so it is committed when the sending takes place. The test for ""grossly offensive"" was stated by the House of Lords in DPP v Collins [2006] 1 WLR 2223 to be whether the message would cause gross offence to those to whom it relates (in that case ethnic minorities), who need not be the recipients. The case also said that it is justifiable under ECHR Art 10(2) to prosecute somebody who has used the public telecommunications system to leave racist messages.

&gt; A person guilty of an offence under section 127 CA 2003 shall be liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine or to both. This offence is part of the fixed penalty scheme.

&gt; Section 127 can be used as an alternative offence to such crimes for example as hate crime (including race, religion, disability, homophobic, sexual orientation, and transphobic crime), hacking offences, cyber bullying, cyber stalking, amongst others.

The entire basis of a sensible legal system is to draw the line somewhere and remove consistency.

You can earn a certain amount of money without paying tax, but if you earn more then you have to - where's the consistency there? You can knock into somebody in the street (even if it hurts them) but you're not allowed to walk up to someone and punch them - shouldn't it be more consistent?

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt;Scotlands non-oil tax revenues are £8,200 per head

No, it's (as of 2011) £8532 per head. 

But then why on earth would you *not* include the oil revenues? 

On a per captia share the oil revenues bump this figure up to about £8700 per head, on a geographical share the figure is over £10,000 per head.

Scotland contributes 9.9% of the UK's taxes (£56.9 billion) and receives 9.3% of government spending (£64.5 billion). Now, whilst this means that, proportionally Scotland receives less than it puts in, but by amount has a £7.6 billion spending deficit, or 13.4% of it's tax income.
However, the UK (including Scotland) runs a spending deficit of £108 billion a year, or 17.6% of UK tax income. Without Scotland, the UK runs a deficit of 18.1% of tax income. Then one can take into account ""hidden costs"" of Union, such as Scotland paying interest on a national debt largely run up by England, which has been calculated by some to be as much as £64 billion over 30 years. However, no one is entirely sure how much these ""hidden costs"" amount to altogether.

Scotland *does* spend more than it has, but less of what is has than rUK.

&gt;Scotland will churn along until the oil revenues drys up and it burns through any cash reserves and the country is left utterly bankrupted.

I fail to see how this would not be true if Scotland stayed in the UK, since, *as I have said* the Westminster government does not invest in Scotland, and so it's economy does not grow without considerable effort from Scotland itself. 

With proper investment Scotland's economy not relating to oil (for instance it's *massive* green energy potential, six times what it currently generates from both green and conventional sources) can grow, meaning that when the oil runs out it would have a strong economy to fall back on. In addition you pay no attention to the proposed oil fund, or to the oil fields off the West coast, currently untapped and unavailable due to the MoD.

&gt; * 4) Owning a hand gun without a license warranted high fines/jail time.

That is the case with current licensed firearms, there is no reason to assume it would be any different with handguns. A re-introduction of handguns would be quite easy, there could be a minimum requirement of previously holding a FAC for 12 months and demonstrating a good record of usage and safety during that time. We already require 2 referees for a FAC application, so for a handgun application an additional referee would be no hardship, possibly from a shooting club official who has monitored the applicant during their shooting career/probation period.

As far as advertising goes, currently shooting sport magazines carry advertisements for rifles and shotguns. As the firearm industry is pretty much 4 or 5 large importers I doubt if this would change.

That's a really big risk given the way that injury can derail careers.

Salah could grow into a £20mil player too and we have a much better idea of what we'd be getting to start with as far as he goes.  He's played a lot in the past year and a half and isn't currently conquering a career threatening injury.

I liked Romulo before the injury and if he is able to recover and carry on where he left off he'd be a really smart pickup from us (and to be honest, I hope he carries on like he never even stopped and we get him).  The guy looked quite a player and with huge potential before he got injured.

In California, I lived on the other side of the highway from the hood. My friends who lived round there sometimes saw dead bodies in the street. That never even made the news. Shootings sometimes made the local papers.

Another town I lived in had a serious problem with armed drug gangs. At night you'd sometimes hear handguns going off, pop-pop. There were areas you'd just never go into. A couple of times I rolled past Mexican guys with guns tucked into their waistbands.

You could walk into a hardware store, sporting goods or big box store and buy a rifle, a handgun or a 12 gauge. I had another friend on a foreign visa do exactly that, walk out with a shotgun. Technically illegal, but nobody ever checked.

The American infatuation with guns is the most alien thing about them. You're having a conversation with an American who seems perfectly normal, and then it gets around to guns and they're rabidly in defense of everyone having weapons that can slaughter a class of schoolchildren from 100 yards away, and more often than not spouting loony conspiracy theories about the UN as well. Americans aren't normal people.

It's very, very hard for the rest of the world to understand the way Americans worship the constitution like Muslims worship the fucking Koran, especially a maximalist interpretation of the second amendment. But it's just the way they are. In fairness, Brits believe some weird things too, like the unquestioned right of some inbreds to rule the country, but those weird things don't cause thousands of gruesome deaths every year.

The gun-worshiping completely infests Reddit and I find I hate being on the American dominated internet more and more because of it. I don't even look into gun control articles. It's much worse than even the religious debates.

Gerrard has an attacking brain, which allows him to pick out killer passes, as well as smash beauties from distance. However, when we turn the ball over, we need whoever is up top (Suarez, Sterling, Sturridge) to all press the ball IMMEDIATELY, along with Hendo to run like hell and cut off passing lanes. This will either win us the ball back, or, more importantly, allow Gerrard the time to drop back with Allen to steady the midfield. From what I've seen, Stevie isn't actually lacking in fitness, but in speed. Of course, this relies on every single player doing their due part, and it actually puts an IMMENSE amount of work for Henderson, but the boy has shown he has amazing legs and can run for hours.

Small examples would be if a team has a slowish fullback, we would have our fastest winger there and on the other side the tricky one can play against the faster fullback or something like that. Of course as others have mentioned though this really needs exceptional players capable of doing so.

This is just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.  I think many people on this sub are American (as am I) and are used to pro sports leagues that have a degree of balance and symmetry to them through revenue sharing and other more 'socialist' ideals, if you will.  The Premier League is not like that at all.  There are massive gaps between teams like say Swansea or Cardiff and teams like ManU which are nearly impossible to overcome (we're talking near enough 300M+ difference in revenue between them on an annual basis).  Added to which, since there is no 'season playoff' the victor at the end is, more likely than not, simply going to be the guy with the most expensive team.

At the turn of the millenium crime of virtually every type was on the rise, from murder, to violent crime, to theft, and (even though it isn't necessary- you can't look at a number, ignore the fact you don't know the confounding variables, and draw your conclusion based on what you see) this means you aren't able to tell whether the rise was caused by a ban, or by something else. You don't have any explanation for the rise either.

It's essential to consider the non-oil revenues because at some point in the not too distant future the oil and gas *is* going to run out. And if Scotland is going to focus it's economy on energy production, that is going to happen much sooner rather than later. The ROI of off-shore wind energy, which is where the bulk of Scotlands potential is, is notoriously low and requires huge capital investment. We're talking single digit percentage returns. Scotland is *not* going to build an economy on renewable energy.  
  
As for the value of the oil, even Scotlands geographic share of the remaining oil and gas is only worth between £1,000-1,500b. That covers the spending deficit for at best 80 years, at worst 60. And I suppose the economic stimulus money is going to come out that pot as well, so you can probably half those two figures. The 'hidden' costs of Union you estimate at £60b over 30 years. I note from your figures that while Scotland will be taking a geographical share of the oil, it won't be taking a geographical share of the £500b worth of liabilities of its two nationalised banks...  
  
Ignoring all that you can still say; oh, well if we're going to generate a net deficit anyway we might as well go it alone! But you're neglecting the political and economic benefits of union. Without the UKs EU membership an independent Scotland will almost certainly;  
  
* lose the UKs currency opt-out and be forced to adopt the Euro  
  
* the judicial opt-out would be lost  
  
* the British Rebate, worth £5b per year, would be lost  
  
As for the ability of the common man to have a greater say in who represents him on the world stage. Sure he might have a greater say on *who* does the talking, but they aren't going to be talking very loudly. Geopolitically, Scotland would fall from enjoying the benefits of being one of the five permanent members of the Security Council to having the same voting rights as Lithuania and Slovakia. For example just recently the UK was able to negotiate an EU deal on fishing quotas that Scotland would not have had the clout to push through on its own.  
  
A final consideration is that an independent Scottish economy is going to have to compete directly with the UK while at the same time losing privileged access to markets that the UK enjoys, both inside and outside the Commonwealth. The fundamental benefits of union with a larger economy (the fourth largest in the world) allows Scotland to pool resources and divest risk and a larger tax base is more readily able to absorb fluctuations, such as say the collapse of a national bank.",0,1390607081,null,0,false,0,cey58sz,t3_1w14er,t1_cey58sz,t1_cey1dzd,null,1432094350,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Point: Oscar and Mata are not the same. Agreed.
Now, he states that Mata is a like for like sub. That doesn't make any sense. 

You put Mata centrally, he will do wonders with possession. He is much better at slowing the game down and creating chances. He brings something different. Salah, on the other hand, is a like for like sub for Willian. 

Now, back to comparing Mata and Oscar. They are not the same player. Oscar, as stated, is more complete. Mata, on the other hand, is a much better playmaker. Everyone can see it. But, for the stat lovers, Mata created more chances in about half the minutes than Oscar.

With that said, Mata was forced to play wide, nullifying his unique ability. ""The something different"".

With interest rates of 10%, as in the late 80s, mortgages are expensive, house prices are (relatively) low. When the rate goes up by 3%, mortgages get a bit more expensive, house prices drop a bit, and the banks lose a bit. Much less risky.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt;The ROI of off-shore wind energy, which is where the bulk of Scotlands potential is, is notoriously low and requires huge capital investment.

Which is why we exploit all the other opportunities, for hydroelectric power stations, geothermal energy, tidal energy.

Do we *build* an economy on green energy? No, but we use it as a cornerstone for a much wider economy, with more focus on manufacturing, and building on the Scottish prestige in the software industry, in addition to the existing institutions, banking, services, food and drink etc.

&gt; The 'hidden' costs of Union you estimate at £60b over 30 years.

I make reference to *ONE* of the hidden costs being £64 billion over the last 30 years, there are still plenty others, for example HS2, expected to cost Scotland ~£8 billion and which will, in the worst case scenario, drain hundreds of millions of pounds from it's economy, or the CAP funds awarded to Scottish farmers and kept by the UK government, equalling €220 million a year, or the disproportionate defence spending.

&gt;it won't be taking a geographical share of the £500b worth of liabilities of its two nationalised banks

No, because 1) this money was given to the banks, not Scotland, 2) they where ""Scottish"" banks in the sense that they were *headquartered* in Scotland, most business took place elsewhere 3) a lot of this money has been paid back, I don't know anything about £500 billion, the figure I had seen was about £40 billion outstanding, which the banks where still paying back.

&gt;lose the UKs currency opt-out and be forced to adopt the Euro

Except many, many other countries in the EU have been allowed to join and have found ways of retaining their own currency, such as Sweden and Hungary. Many economists have found the idea of a separate Scottish currency tied to the pound in the same way that Sweden has done with the Euro and it's Kronor to be the best solution.

&gt;Sure he might have a greater say on who does the talking, but they aren't going to be talking very loudly. 

I am actually fine with not being a major world player if it means my quality of life improves (or, if we're being pessimistic, decreases at a slower rate than if Scotland were a part of the UK). Look at the rankings for GDP in comparison to the World Happiness Index. China, the UK, US, Russia are all down the list, whereas the Scandinavian countries regularly top it.

&gt; Geopolitically, Scotland would fall from enjoying the benefits of being one of the five permanent members of the Security Council

But Scotland has no say in that *anyway*, as it is represented there by the British prime minister. And, as I have already said, Scotland's say in that matter is negligible.

In addition to this, the UK's influence has been declining dramatically over the last 100 years, only a fool would think this trend would not continue, especially with the US's own decline.

&gt; For example just recently the UK was able to negotiate an EU deal on fishing quotas that Scotland would not have had the clout to push through on its own.

You say this completely oblivious to the fact that it was a Westminster government who gave up Scottish fishing rights in the first place, so that they could protect English fishing rights and, in turn, their future election results. Scotland has been little more than the UK's cannon fodder, and because of population disparity, there has been little political backlash.

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Switzerland actually has around 15 times as many firearms related deaths per capita than the UK

The vast majority of them are either suidide or unintential. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate

Even so the point is that more guns does not equal more deaths/crime which is the main argument. You may have more deaths with guns specifically because they're available but that only means they're being used instead of something else not that the crimes or deaths wouldn't happen if they weren't around. 

&gt;They also have compulsory military service and weapons training

Compulsury military service is not the only way to create mature, responsible gun owners. We had more liberal gun laws and there wasn't an issue and if you thought it was that serious you could require mandatory training. 

&gt;culture of hunting which we do not have

We have a culture of hunting. Pheasant are hunted and shot for sport.

&gt;It is also illegal in Switzerland to use your firearm for personal defence under any circumstance

No I don't think it is. You can get a permit to use a gun for self defense.

As a worked example:
We bought in the South East in 2006, with a £200k mortgage on the house at £232k

We Paid about £1,400 a month on a 2 year fixed rate to minimise impact whilst we found our feet. Our combined earnings at the time were about £60k and the mortgage was affordable - with a bit of leeway but not much.We then re-fixed for another 5 years (big mistake as it turned out!) at £1,380 a month.

However, Neither of us got a pay rise for 5 years - myself in the public sector, my wife in the private sector. Even promotion only just kept us in line wih inflation a couple of years, and in real terms we found our cost of living increasing faster than our earnings.

So despite 'trying to do the right thing' we were punished substantially for being risk averse, and fixing our morgage, meaning we didn't feel the benefit of several years of very low interest rates. That is only our fault and I'm no blaming anyone.

However, we are now in a situation where rates may rise - indeed it seems inevitable as soon as that 7% unemploymen target is met, and we will once again be having to find extra money for our tracking rate mortgage.

We haven't bought an overpriced unaffordable house, we haven't bought *investment properties*, we haven't gone into negative equity. We just bought a house to live in in the South East. Economic factors outside our control mean that we are in no better position financially than we were 8 years ago (from a UK perspective). A sharp rise in interest rates could worsen that position. I'm not worried about 0.5% or so, but 2%-3% would be very damaging, not just to my personal situation but to home owners across the board, IMO.

I see the article heavily references Interest Only Mortgages. These will be the 'endowment policy' of the future, IMO. I know of several colleagues who simply can't understand that at the end of their interest only mortgage, they will not own their house and will have to find the capital to pay for it. If you've been living it large by ignoring that fundmental principle of borrowing money, then I also have very little sympathy.",0,1390613180,null,0,1390613484,0,cey7rqh,t3_1w1bcw,t1_cey7rqh,t3_1w1bcw,null,1432095543,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think that's a big ask, and it limits you in terms of who you buy. I mean, if Thiago Silva was available, you'd get him - not equivocate over his inability to play another position. The way I see it is, adaptability is a great trait for squad players - but the most important thing for the first XI is for them to be great in whatever their primary position is. United under Ferguson would have pure CB's in Vidic &amp; Ferdinand, but then supplement with someone like John O'Shea, who could play anywhere along the back four, as a squad player.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I think i broadly align with your point of view.

Shotguns and rifles fall on the right side of 'benefit to the individual' vs 'cost to sociey'. It's fine to own them, even just for recreation, because their cost overall is limited by heir difficulty to conceal and use in manners that are detrimenal to society.

Handguns fall on the wrong side of that line: the ONLY legitimate use for them in the UK is shooting bits of paper, at an enclosed range. The costs to society are huge, since if you increase the number in circulation, you have to accpet that you increase their availability to those who want to use them for criminal purposes. The potential cost far outweights the benefits.

Despite people asserting that 'criminals will arm themselves anyway', it's very, very hard for criminals to get hold of a handgun in the UK. Even the ammunition is scarce. That's why criminals are reduced to making single shot pistols in sheds, or using rusting 100 year old service revolvers. That or converting Brocock air pistols or start line guns. Even if they do get hold of a cheap modern eastern Block handgun, it's value as a device to threaten actually outweighs it's lethal utiliy. Guns are hard enough to come by that criminals do NOT want to actually use them, since they then have to dump them.

I think we have the balance about right in the UK, with everyone free to enjoy not being threatened by handguns, vs enthusiast and recreational shooters being able to shoot targets, clays etc with rifles if they wish.

I disagree. Many journeys are made for the purpose of pleasure. And many business journey are made for the purpose of acquiring wealth that can later be spent pleasurably.

So if we were to ban guns under the principle that saving lives is more important than people having fun, we would also have to ban many car journeys under the same principle (and bus, taxi, lorry, etc, journeys since all can kill people).

And they do pose with different sorts of things, but there is a difference between his training partner handing him a t-shirt and some random guy on the street. He would obviously not pose with something that had white power or other sorts because he would notice. And I am saying he did probably explain it to him and asked for a pose. It's just that posing is a bit far from supporting a cause. 

I'm sorry, but I'm not being cynical, I'm just not being naive. If he would have posed in a more serious manner, I would still not believe it, but I would avoid voicing my doubts.
