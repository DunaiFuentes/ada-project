&gt; How safe do you feel now when cycling around your town or city? Has this feeling improved from the past?

My time is Split between Uni and Home. Uni being one of the largest cities in the UK, home being rural.

At Uni I wouldn't go as far as saying I feel unsafe, but there are definitely more incidents - which is to be expected seeing as there are more people about. Obviously there are a few idiots out there who just want to cause hassle. But the majority of the problems I've had that weren't my fault were just people taking bad decisions, it happens to the best of us!
There are plenty of cyclist on the roads, so drivers are generally aware. As long as you don't ride like a prick you shouldn't get much trouble. 
When I was riding a lot the vast majority of trouble I had was caused by other cyclists, unfortunately. I got sick and tired of people almost running into my because they were jumping red lights or giving me hassle because I didn't want to filter up the inside of a lorry turning left. 

I've had one nasty incident while riding at uni, where a woman who was on her phone overtook and decided to turn into a side road half way through. Some how she managed to rip off my chain and sent me on a leisurely flight into the road. I get the feeling she wasn't expecting my speed, this area of road is fairly easy to match traffic speed and as a result I was riding within the lane (at the speed of the bus in front) so I could overtake slower cyclists who were closer to the curb. So I think she misjudged it and thought she could make it.

Again, poor judgement but fair enough. What really got me is that the nasty cow didn't even bother putting the phone down, she just opened the window to call me an idiot and drove off. 

That is the only time I've had any sort of real trouble. Most of the problems I've had seem to come from people thinking I'm going slower than I was, which is fair enough.

Strangest thing to happen was some lads in a van overtook about 6 of us when we were going down hill at 30mph-ish calling us benders and then pulled back in and dropped back to the speed limit. We found that highly amusing so we decided to pick up the pace  and ride along side them (the road by this point was 2 lanes each side and slightly downhill), which the lads in the van found hilarious. Had a quick chat with them at the lights and it was all good fun. 
The point of my story is that some cyclists would have caused an uproar about that, but at the end of the day it was just a bunch of lads taking the piss out of another bunch of lads who were wearing lycra... Can't blame them!


I'd say the facilities for commuting cyclists have actually got worse around here, due to poor maintenance. 

=
At home, in the rural area, there isn't any sort of cycling facilities. I do most of my riding on single track roads up in the mountains.
I generally feel safer than at uni, but the worry of meeting someone around a blind corner at speed is a bit frightening.
Generally around the area I live people are relaxed, I do my best to be friendly and helpful to drivers where I can - Moving in, waving them past when I can see it's safe, giving them a friendly wave and such. People seem to respond well to that in the rural area, I often get people giving me the thumbs up or giving a friendly beep for it. At the end of the day it's just common courtesy to be polite to someone who's patiently waited behind you until it was safe for them to overtake/me move over... Isn't it?

Only problem I've ever had at home is a bus coming out of a side road and a bit to far into my lane. It was all a bit last minute, but I just moved out of the way and he waved sorry. No harm done.


&gt;What kind of cyclist would you regard yourself as - a regular commuter during weekday mornings and evenings, or someone who rides as a serious hobby in your spare time? Perhaps a non-committal hobby cyclist every now and again?

I was a keen hobby cyclist, riding with many who cycled at a competitive level. We used to ride out of the city into the sticks. People in the city didn't like the fact we had a 5/6 rider chain going on, but it was rare that we didn't match traffic speeds within the city. 

Now I'm not really anything, but I hope to become a competitive rider soon.

I get the feel commuters get a lot more trouble. Everyone seems to be in a bad mood on their commute, regardless of their chosen vehicle. It'll help that I do most of my riding in hilly areas and they tend to be pretty rural. 

=

If I could make the roads a better place for both drivers and cyclists, my main change would be getting everyone to relax! Forget segregated cycle lanes, forget ASLs, forget the lot of it.
Everyone's attitude seems to change when they are on the road, and I'm not sure why! British roads feel hostile. People make mistakes, minor mistakes aren't something to shout and scream about. Near misses that could end up killing you, fair enough - I'd get upset. But why do some people feel the need to block commuters riding past them in traffic jams? If some bloke things he can pull out in time, but changes his mind, then why shout and swear?! Being angry isn't going to change how long it takes you to get from A to B. Just relax, be a decent person and I genuinely feel like the majority of the issues we have on UK roads would end.",0,1391212904,null,0,1391213538,0,cf40ety,t3_1wnlqa,t1_cf40ety,t3_1wnlqa,null,1432198590,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,CircleTheFire,lfc99,,"I'm assuming you mean Dempsey, Willian, Salah, and Knoplyanka? Let's address them in that order:

* **Dempsey:** Ownership would not release the funds to get the deal done. That's not on Ayre. Also, Dempsey barely played, for Spurs and was shit for them when he did. He then played a few matches for Seattle, and was shit for them. He then went back to Fulham on loan, and has been shit for them too. We dodged a huge bullet by having ownership stand firm on a valuation.


* **Willian:** He has been solid for Chelski this far, but has be been $30+ million good? Not even close. And who sits if he had him? Not Suarez or Sturridge. Not Coutinho. Not Lucas or Gerrard. That leaves Hendo and Sterling, who have been awesome this year. So, do you think Willian has been $30 million better then either of them? Not a chance.

* **Salah:** Chelski's deal is 12 million up front with escalators that will probably see the final total on the deal reach 16+ million. Same questions apply to him as to Willian, but more focused out wide. So basically, Sterling. Is he $12 to $16 million better than Sterling? Almost certainly not.

* **Konoplyanka:** He was never intended to be signed this window, so no one from owndership down to the manager was prepared to negotiate on a short time frame. AND THAT IS OK. We tried to get a deal done for him under difficult circumstances, and it didn't happen. So what? He was not seen as a high enough priority to negotiate for ahead of Salah. He couldn't have been that important to the manager's or club's needs, otherwise *he* would have been the one we went after first. He was a fallback plucked out of future considerations.

For fuck's sake, none of these players are or were necessary! We're scoring goals at an alarmingly high rate, and we aren't giving up that many. Our goal differential is **18 better** than the 5th best team in that category!

THE FUCKING SKY IS NOT FAILING. IAN AYRE IS NOT THE ANTICHRIST. THE TEAM IS FINE. TOP 4 IS WELL WITHIN REACH. RELAX.

Dembele on the other hand is not and never will be a CDM.  He is not the strongest tackler we have, he's not that good at interceptions, and his overall positional sense is not amazing when it comes to defending.  City's first goal the other day was a direct result of Silva getting into space behind Dembele.  A proper CDM would not have allowed that.

Basically I think it is incredibly important who that person is.  Look at the top teams in the world right now - there's a reason Barca play Busquets as their deepest CM and not Xavi.  Xabi Alonso is there for Real, not Isco.  Bayern play Martinez and Schweinsteiger, not Muller.  Juventus play Pirlo, not Marchisio or Pogba.

It is incredibly important to have a team that is both versatile, but uses players according to their strengths.

The success or failure should be determined by how much or how little transfer dealings by the teams who have a realistic chance to overtake and those that have a realistic chance to overtake us. Thus:

* **Arsenal, City, Chelski:** It's unlikely no matter what we did this window, we were catching 2 of them, with the third an achievable but unlikely goal. Chelski pipping us for Salah or reinforces the already likely scenario.


* **Spurs and Newcastle:** Does anyone actually think either of them are a threat? They aren't going to hang around the top of the table very long with a negative or barely positive goal differential. No team reaches top 4 by breaking even over the course of a full season.

* **Everton and Manc Scum** So really, we're competing for 4th with a team we've already thrashed and drawn with, and a team that is aging and largely in disarray, with a manager that has been mediocre at best thus far. And our goal differential is nearly **3x** what either of theirs is.

So, do you honestly think either of those two *realistic* threats are actually threats to LFC keeping a firm grip on 4th, and possibly 3rd?

You are letting your emotions get the best of you. Reinforcements are nice, but we doing pretty fucking well for having our top 2 scorers both having missed a fair amount of time, and nearly all of our defensive players being injured for large portions of the season between them. Why lose the faith in what the club is doing now?

You can chant YNWA all you want, but it means shit if you aren't also chanting it when things don't go the way you think they should.

It's also impossible for people to live outside the money economy. There is no place in the UK where a person can legally move to, build a home and live by foraging and hunting. People NEED a source of income to survive. 

The only long term realistic solution is to implement a basic income for everyone. This is a single payment which is given to everyone without qualifications or limitations.

""
    Good evening, London. I thought it time we had a little talk. Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin...
    I suppose you're wondering why I've called you here this evening. Well you see, I'm not entirely satisfied with your performance lately…. I'm afraid your work's been slipping, and...and well, I'm afraid we've been thinking about letting you go.
    Oh, I know, I know. You've been with the company a long time now. Almost...Let me see. Almost ten thousand years! My word, doesn't time fly? It seems like only yesterday… I remember the day you commenced your employment, swinging down from the trees, fresh-faced and nervous, A bone clasped in your bristling fist... ""Where do I start, sir?"" You asked, plaintively.
    I recall my exact words: ""There's a pile of dinosaur eggs over there, youngster,"" I said smiling paternally the while. ""Get sucking.""
    Well, we've certainly come a long way since then, haven’t we? And yes, yes, you're right, in all that time you haven’t missed a day. Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Also please don't think I've forgotten about your out-standing service record, or about all of the invaluable contributions that you've made to the company... Fire, the wheel of agriculture...It's an impressive list, old-timer. A jolly impressive list. Don't get me wrong.
    But...well, to be frank, we've had our problems, too. There's no getting away from it. Do you know what I think a lot of it stems from? I'll tell you... It's your basic unwillingness to get on within the company. You don't seem to want to face up to any real responsibility, or to be your own boss. Lord knows, you've been given plenty of opportunities...We've offered you promotion time and time again, and each time you've turned us down: ""I couldn't handle the work, Guv'nor,"" you wheedled. ""I know my place""
    To be frank, you're not trying, are you? You see, you've been standing still for far too long, and it's starting to show in your work... And I might add, in your general standard behaviour. The constant bickering on the factory floor has not escaped my attention...Nor the recent bouts of rowdiness in the staff canteen. Then of course there's... Hmmmm. Well, I didn't really want to have to bring this up, but...Well, you see I've been hearing some disturbing rumours about your personal life.
    No, never you mind who told me. No names, no pack drill... I understand that you are unable to get on with your spouse. I hear that you argue. I am told that you shout. Violence has been mentioned. I am reliably informed that you always hurt the one you love...The one you shouldn't hurt at all.
    And what about the children? It's always the children who suffer, as you're well aware. Poor little mites. What are they to make of it? What are they to make of your bullying, your despair, your cowardice and all your fondly nurtured bigotries? Really, it's not good enough, is it? And it's no good blaming the drop in work standards upon bad management, either...
    Though, to be sure, the management is very bad. In fact, let us not mince words ... the management is terrible! We've had a string of embezzlers, frauds, liars and lunatics making a string of catastrophic decisions. This is plain fact.
    But who elected them? It was you! You who appointed these people! You who gave them the power to make your decisions for you! While I'll admit that anyone can make a mistake once, to go on making the same lethal errors century after century seems to me nothing short of deliberate.
    You have encouraged these malicious incompetents, who have made your working life a shambles. You have accepted without question their senseless orders. You have allowed them to fill your workspace with dangerous and unproven machines.
    All you had to say was ""NO."" You have no spine. You have no pride. You are no longer an asset to the company. I will however, be generous. You will be granted two years to show me some improvement in your work. If at the end of that time you are still unwilling to make a go of it... You're fired.
    That will be all. You may return to your labors.""

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt; How safe do you feel now when cycling around your town or city? Has this feeling improved from the past?

As I live in a fairly rural area, it feels quite safe. The roads are less busy, the motorists seem to be more accepting. I can't compare it to the past too much as I didn't cycle on the roads until not too long ago.

&gt; What kind of cyclist would you regard yourself as - a regular commuter during weekday mornings and evenings, or someone who rides as a serious hobby in your spare time? Perhaps a non-committal hobby cyclist every now and again?

I cycle to keep fit in my spare time, so probably more towards non-commital hobby cyclist. I occasionaly use my Bike to get to places, but I also enjoy going for rides to get a bit of fresh air, kind of like an evening jog but without the fatigue in my legs.

&gt; What facilities are available in your town or city for a new cyclist?

Again, as I live in a rural area, there is very little need for cycle lanes or anything like that. There are a couple of walkways/cycle paths, but the problem is they have those metal barriers  (Where they narrow at handlebar height to stop motorbikes, like this: http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/35/65/2356542_89cd2165.jpg) every couple of hundred metres. This means I have to stop, get off my bike and lift it up before I can continue. This is akin to having stop signs on the M1 every half a mile, it's completely nonsensical.

Like everyone else I think we needed an attacking midfielder.

We might even see Gardner get a game at some point!


Bertrand was a great addition and allows Delph more freedom to go forward rather than always having to cover for Luna. Holt is good cover for Kozak and adds a bit of experience. Overall I think we haven't done too badly. 


Teams around us had much worse windows. Above us, Southampton are now very thin up front losing Osvaldo, Newcastle lost Cabaye without replacing him. That could help us put pressure on them.

I'm very much of the mind that everything can be done more efficiently and I hate that things are done because that's the way they have been done before. Change is needed and we need to think to the future instead of hanging on to the past.

 I do think that more jobs can be brought back from overseas, Corgi for example who make die cast collectors models are planning on bringing back manufacturing from China to a UK factory it offers jobs for people in this country, better quality control, less transport costs ( getting more important with rising fuel costs) and less communications difficulties with the factory and quicker turnarounds. All this for very little extra cost. A step in the right direction. 

This strange situation where low paid jobs pay less than benefits and still just provide a working wage is a dangerous situation to be as it encourages people not to work as well, something needs to be done about that too.

A flat basic wage will never work, too expensive (maybe it wouldn't be? I haven't really looked at the figures) and you'll have labour voters complaining that middle class and wealthy people shouldn't get it, so there will be a cut off where some jobs again aren't worth doing or people crying about inequality as the rich are getting the same as the poor. 

Would reduced living costs in real terms not be better where pensions, disability benefits, low paid jobs and so on will provide a liveable wage instead of trying to pay everyone more? It might even encourage more parents to stay at home to look after children which would free up jobs for more families/single people and also allow an earlier retirement age.

More houses need to be built, housing is simply too expensive.

People should be encouraged to buy British, which supports British exports, British jobs and maybe reduce the money heading overseas.

Its also good to see the agriculture sector booming. It was ridiculous there for a while where sheep farmers could not make a living yet it was cost effective to import lamb from New Zealand.

Training thousands of Chinese and Indian students STEM subjects so they can outdo Britain is not good either. I remember hearing about how Indian workers came to Northern Irish linen and textile factories to learn how to make goods, operate machinery and so on (a huge business here), then the factories there bought the older machines. Then they out competed the NI industry on price and all the work moved there, leaving thousands without work. The quality wasn't there but that doesn't matter when cost is the focus. There were hundreds of textile and garment factories here, now there are three or four.

But the truth is, the missing ones are shit. Babylon 5 can go from supremely excellent to a fucking pile of shit. And I think the consensus is that E I is a fucking pile of shit.

I am ruling on this: watch them in the Machete Order, it is true that none of the story elements in E I are even necessary.

The following is from an article published by The Daily Mail. I'd like to point out that I do not know whether it's insights are truthful or fabricated. For all I know, it could be a work of fiction. Like many of us, I don't trust the mail and I don't like most of the viewpoints they seem to espouse. I quote this, however, because i think it paints a scenario that will serve as a good answer to your question.

&gt;""At times it seems as if the modern police force is seen by senior managers as a vehicle for social engineering rather than deterring crime.

&gt;My internal office phone directory lists no fewer than 32 officers with ‘diversity’ in their job title, all of them working nine-to-five in desk-bound jobs, while we slog it out on the front line. I was half-hoping that, given their irrelevance to the battle against crime, they might be made redundant in the public-sector cuts, but that was far too optimistic.

&gt;Diversity is sacrosanct, its commissars are protected and its influence is all dominant.

&gt;So in our training, for instance, just one day a year is devoted to practical instruction in officer safety, dealing with procedures such as correct use of handcuffs, Tasers and batons, or how to put a violent suspect in a van or cell.

&gt;Yet the effort devoted to diversity is far greater. We have to carry out two days of diversity training a year at headquarters, another day at our divisions, go through an eight-hour ‘e-learning’ package on our computers and, in our annual performance appraisal forms, show that we have accomplished three separate objectives ‘to raise diversity awareness’.

&gt;In addition, during weekly individual meetings with our supervisor, we have to explain what we have done to promote cultural diversity.

&gt;The minutiae of Hindu festivals, details of Black History month and the rituals of gypsy culture are all drummed into us. The whole pantomime is idiotic, especially in my neighbourhood where the ethnic minority is tiny.

&gt;Once, as one of my personal ‘diversity objectives’, I stated I had listened to some Indian sitar music in a Manchester park.""

And Salah chose Chelsea for obvious reasons (cash and the fact that they are a better side atm), and the Konoplyanka deal fell through because of an owner not willing to sell. It isn't all Ayre's fault.

My mum has told me in the past about how she got involved with the squatting scene when she was in her teens, even though she had a home to go to, but it was part of being a punk around that time being the reason she chose to. The fact is, people who choose to sleep rough (experimenting, socially, or whatever), generally have a home to go to when they get fed up.  What about those who don't?  
  
One example, for people who have been denied access to rent a house as they need housing benefit to afford it... with all these landlords wanting to refuse housing benefit claimants a home to rent... where are they going to go? Not everyone has the luxury of a spare bedroom at their parents.

In recent years we have experienced more technological innovation than ever before.

Before the 1980's increases in production and efficiency always led to improved wealth and wages for the working and middle classes, this did not occurred during the present boom, in fact we are experiencing a 'hollowing of the middle class' because many middle class jobs are being replaced by computers or robotics. The increased wealth that has been created has all gone to a small class of rich elites. That means society is stratifying into a world of the super rich who own everything, the small group of highly educated STEM and creative workers (which is much smaller than the old middle class) and the poor.

**Best Start to a Season**

Bill Nicholson’s fantastic team of the early 1960s became the first club of the 20th century to win both the top-flight division of the Football League and the FA Cup in one season (1960-61). In winning the old Division One title, we achieved the most consecutive league victories from the start of a season, winning 11 games - starting with a 2-0 triumph over Everton at White Hart Lane on August 20, 1960, through to a 4-0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on October 1, 1960. It is a top flight record that still stands to this day.

**Most League Wins in a Season**

The Double-winning season of 1960-61 saw Spurs rack up 31 wins in 42 league matches, which remains a record number of victories for a club in one top-flight season.

**Scorers of the Fastest Premier League Goal**

Our former club skipper Ledley King managed a remarkable feat in a Premier League game at Bradford City’s Valley Parade on December 9, 2000. Picking up on a loose ball, King’s shot from around 30 yards deflected past Bantams keeper Matthew Clarke. Crossing the line on 9.7 seconds, Ledley’s goal remains the fastest scored in Premier League history. 

**Fire Success**

We lay claim to scoring the most goals in fastest succession in Premier League history. Strikes from Darren Anderton, Nick Barmby and a brace from Teddy Sheringham were all scored inside a period of four minutes and 44 seconds during the second half of our home match against Southampton on February 7, 1993, setting us on our way to a 4-2 win.

**European Trailblazers**

Our long and illustrious history in European competitions is well known. In 1963, our 5-1 Cup Winners’ Cup Final victory over Atletico Madrid in Rotterdam saw us become the first British team to win a major European trophy. In 1972, we became the first club to win the UEFA Cup (now UEFA Europa League) with a 3-2 aggregate win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. This also made us the first British team to win two different European competitions.

**Played Most Games in the UEFA Cup/UEFA Europe League**

We have played more matches in the UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League than any other British club, appearing in 106 matches of which we have won 59 games, drawn 29 and lost 18. We have won the tournament in 1972 and 1984 and reached the final in 1974. 
 
**Most Consecutive European Victories**
We hold the record of most consecutive matches won by a British team in a European competition. This achievement was made as we won eight matches in a row in the UEFA Cup in season 2006-07 starting with our 1-0 win away to Slavia Prague on September 14, 2006, through to our 3-2 triumph at home to SC Braga on March 8, 2007.*(this might actually be broken this season)*
  
**Top Scorers in Europe**

We are the most prolific goal scorers of any English club in Europe, finding the back of the net 2.1 times on average in each European game. In a total of 163 European matches played to date, we have scored a total of 329 goals. During our UEFA Champion League campaign of 2010-11, we also became the first ever club from any country to score two or more goals in every group game as we topped Group A.

**Only Non-League Winners of the FA Cup**

We were the first and remain the only non-league side ever to win the FA Cup, lifting the famous trophy after a 3-1 final replay victory over Sheffield United on April 27, 1901. Our team, featuring players like John Cameron, Sandy Brown and Tom Smith, was a Southern League side at the time.

**Most England Goals**

We boast the highest number of goals scored by our players representing England than any club in the country. The likes of Jimmy Greaves, Gary Lineker, Teddy Sheringham and Jermain Defoe have contributed to a grand total of 171 goals scored for the Three Lions by Tottenham players over the years. Greaves has scored more goals for England than any of our other players, with 28 of his 44 goals for his country coming while he also wore the white shirt of Spurs.

And also I think only Gerrard and Allen can play 1 at the back. And probably it means more defensive work for Suarez, Sturridge (providing they will change positions during the game) and Coutihno.

Defence: 

with our luck and undefined injury return nature of all our back line,except Skrtel, we have no backup at all for atleast 2-3 weeks (poster on Rawk says that Kelly have a reocurrying problem with a swelling leg and can't return to full fitness for more then a year), we might need to recall some of our loanees, if its not posiible, introduce Smith or even Sama to the first team football, considering Flanno, Robinson, Kelly and Wisdom debut runs in the squad i'm not too worried. And a more deep backline might really compliment Skrtel's, Flanno's, Aly's (and Gerrard's) deffensive abilities.


Backup

Attack: 

Moses - only senior backup on the wings, strong direct winger, haven't yet kick-offed, and when played doesn't seem to integrate well into the team play.

Ibe - didn't have a look in this season. Skillfull, direct, more of an inside forward. Very young and enexpirienced

Aspas - Very little playing time. Forward. Has good game intellegence a knack for original decicions and beatiful attacking plays, but overall till now couldn't adapt to the pace and physical challanges of the game, which seems to undermine everything else.

MIdfield:

Without further injuries, rotation between Allen, Henderson, Coutihno and Gerrard until Lucas's return. 

Alberto - from what i've seen, has an eye for a decisive pass, great circulation of the ball, pressing organisition ability. Same as Aspas, very little playing time, and maybe not ready for a pace and physicality of the league. Also ,not the fastest of players. 
 
Defence:

Kelly - Fitness, fitness, fitness, otherwise (once) very talented defender either on the wing or in the center

Smith - talented attacking fullback, but only 30 min against Chelsea , playing as a winger.

And a bunch of first teamers, due to be back in training in 2-4 weeks.

TL/DR So yeah, i think, to maintain our challenge, we need this ""galvanize"", siege mentality team work in defence and attack, and ""pass and move"" fast counterattacts mainly through the center. Another options being Gerrard, Henderson, Allen midfield (more possesion based) with Coutihno or Sterling on the bench. Or Sturridge and Suarez being rotated. That's assuming there's no more injuries. Only one more injury in attack/midfield will leave us with currently ""fringe"" players next in the line. Defence numbers are not pretty either, but here players should be back in 2-4 weeks, unlike Lucas, who the manager says is 2 month off

If both parties had, in fact, agreed upon a price, then surely the selling party (the owner, apparently) would have signed the papers. By the sound of things, we negotiated a price with some people at Dnipro that would never be able to seal the deal in the first place. That's just silly (at best).

The third option is that the owner is a massive c*nt, and that we had a deal in place to which he had agreed, but then refused to sign. I'm not convinced.

* Then on the other hand, perhaps Ayre didn't do enough; Perhaps FSG wasn't willing to pay enough.

Either way, what's done is done. We have to carry on.

We have Agger, Allen, Enrique, Johnson, Sakho all on the mend and should all return relatively soon (with Lucas later on down the line). The ""It's like a new signing!"" cliche comes to mind. Honestly, depth be damned. We just need our starting XI to be fit, perform well and play each match with - here comes another cliche - the intensity of Cup final and grab a Champions League spot and then we can worry about adding to the squad in the summer.

And think about it ... was Salah or Konoplyanka *really* going to be the player that would bring us the Champions League? Maybe. Maybe not. Hard to tell but it's not as if those players were a clear improvement to the starting XI like, say, Juan Mata.

Ultimately, I think this is where Brendan Rodgers will have to earn his wages. It will be up to Rodgers to motivate, challenge, push, the players to get the best out of them week-in, week-out, no complacency allowed. Rodgers and the coaches need to be extra sharp preparing for each team, getting the tactics right, getting the subs right.

The first time we saw River Song, she was created to act as a liaison between the Doctor and the Astronauts. The astronauts had no reason to trust the Doctor, who broke into an impenetrable planet as far as they know. If the Astronauts did not trust the Doctor, the story would not happen. The solution was either to have the Doctor know one of the Astronauts or to have one of the Astronauts know the Doctor. Moffat decided the former was boring and did the latter. He made River Song because it was interesting to have a character who knows the Doctor, but whom the Doctor does not. Alex Kingston had a that reaction from that reveal because she had good stage directions. 

Season 5 and beyond was a different matter entirely. According to Alex Kingston, Steven Moffat told her the general story arc of River Song when she came in as a semi regular. She knew a lot more about River than Matt, Karen, and Arthur ever did. Despite what fans think, the reveal that River was Amy and Rory's daughter was planned out well in advanced.

&gt; * Contact your provider's customer services department and explain your problem
&gt; * If this doesn't resolve the issue, make a formal complaint to the company. You should find details of how to do this on the back of your bill, on their website or ask their customer services.

You have to wait eight weeks from when you first formally complain before you can contact the ADR -- I'm guessing you haven't made a formal complaint yet (according to the instructions given by Virgin), but maybe if you have evidence going back that might count. The ADR schemes are independent of Virgin, so they should be fair.

Just having a brief look at the ADR schemes' websites, it looks like you don't have to pay anything to make a complaint (other than your time). After all that you might be awarded some compensation from Virgin; but, one of the ADR schemes says that the average payout (for those entitled to compensation) is just £80, so I wouldn't get your hopes up for too much.

The reality is you usually overpay for talent in the midseason transfer period and we've got a limited budget (for the moment, more on that later), so we all sorta knew we weren't going to add anyone better then we already have on the roster.  PL has made pretty good choices IMO. Obviously Benteke, Bacuna is versatile and can take free kicks, Okore looked good prior to his injury, and Bertrand has looked like a nice fit at the back. I think Holt is a half season teacher for Helenius, who isn't quite there but shown flashes. Tony moon is a WB which is like its cousin the true winger (Tonev for us) are limited, luxury roles, but they do give a little versatility for the lineup. Luna just can't be a true back in a 3 or 4 back lineup and Tonev looks a little overmatched. I think PL is forced to stick with more or less starting 11 because we aren't good enough consistently for him to take any games lightly. This is a squad capable of beating Man City (albeit in mildly miraculous fashion) and Arsenal, yet losing to Fulham and Palace.We have to remember, Villa are the youngest squad on average in the Prem, which means we are going to lack consistency. We've shown flashes of brilliance and if we can maintain our standing and keep the player development train rolling (PL seems to have an eye for young, cheap, and talented), then we can build a strong club from within, in a cost effective manner, while saving funds for the big splashes when we need them. It is a big club and should spend like one, but shouldn't pretend we are City or Chelsea either.Aside from the goalless October and thereabouts stretch, we've been pretty good. Out of our 10 losses, we have the afore mentioned pair and 7 losses to teams ahead of us: Arsenal, Newcastle, United, Spurs, Everton, Liverpool, and Chelsea. We were hard done to not take a point from Chelsea and anyone who watch the entirety of both Liverpool games knows we should've have 4-6 points from those instead of 1, but hey it breaks that way sometimes. This is a team on the rise and I think PL is building a team with a strong foundation instead of a cash splash quick fix. Speaking of cash, I'm convinced Lerner's current frugality is because of the situation with the Browns in the NFL. For any Brits who don't know, Lerner sold the team to a guy who owns a gas station chain, but retained a % interest in the team. However, the new owner (Haslem I believe) is under federal investigation for some sort of illegal work practices. I think Lerner is waiting to make sure he gets paid and doesn't have to reacquire the team. Edit: forgot Kozak who was good until his injury.",0,1391241709,null,0,1391241981,0,cf49rhg,t3_1woo5a,t1_cf49rhg,t3_1woo5a,null,1432203037,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2

true,iaindings,null,null,"Sadly, this is the state we've got to with ""up to"" speeds and peoples expectations. It's as much the fault of the consumer in some cases - I want 100mb bandwidth but only want to pay 35p for it, and it has to be guaranteed 100mb at all times and never fail! 
I have a 100mb fibre (actual fibre, with light coming out of it) connection at work - it costs £1500 a month.
Anyway, switching to a slower package is likely to increase your speed at peak times. Here's an explanation in layman's terms..

Virgin have a point of presence (POP) which is where all the connections in your local area end up - copper to the cabinet then fibre from there. This is where the connections enter virgins network and the internet. These will have lots and lots of routers - universal broadband routers (UBR). They'd have UBRs for each sort of package, there'll be ones for 100mb domestic customers, ones for 20mb business customers etc. It's the UBRs which are oversubscribed.
When you get connected, you'll be connected to a shiny new under-utilised UBR, this is why everyone who gets cable broadband says how awesome it is just after it's installed. Over time, more and more new subscribers are connected to it, it becomes oversubscribed and they'll eventually put a new one in. If you can get talking to the right person, at least back in the telewest days, you'll be able to arrange to be moved to a different UBR or find out what the replacement schedule is. But here's the point - which do you think is likely to be more oversubscribed? The 100mb one full of 15 year olds torrenting 24/7 or the 30mb one which people have as part of a package and use for checking their hotmail once in a while.
Tl;Dr - you don't ""need"" 100mb, if you did need it for anything remotely important you'd be paying a lot more for it. But switch to 30mb and you'll likely see much more consistent speeds. 30mb most of the day sounds better than 100mb sometimes.",0,1391242785,null,0,false,0,cf49z01,t3_1wp1ac,t1_cf49z01,t1_cf42wma,null,1432203113,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I'm guessing you aren't currently paying back a student loan! I know how it works thanks, I'm currently paying one back. And you got you figures slightly wrong for the new system, you pay back over £21k, it's written off after 30 years, and the average wage is £26.5k. 

I'll explain what I mean by  ""I'd rather have the money now"". When you first graduate is when you most need money, you have the lowest earnings, you will need to find somewhere live or save for a deposit on a house or if you are lucky pay back a high loan-to-value mortgage. It seems stupid at that stage in your life that you are stung with loan repayments.

Under the new system, if you earn the average wage you'll be paying back around £500 a year, that is enough money to make a difference. I'm currently paying back around a grand a year because I'm on the old system with the £16K threshold. By the time it's written off I hope to be earning more and have mostly paid off my mortgage, I won't need the extra money then. Plus I'd rather have more disposable income to enjoy myself now when I'm young than have it suddenly increase when I'm already middle aged.

It is more like a graduate tax than a loan repayment, but that doesn't mean it has no effect on your life. I don't know why the Tories are having such a fit charging people earning over £150k an extra 5% tax when they can easily afford it, but don't see that charging people an extra 9% over £21K would have any effect on their lives. If they raised income tax for everyone people earning over £21K by 9% people would go crazy, so they do it to young graduates who don't know any better and don't know how good their parents had it. The new system is better in a way though with the higher payment threshold, although you'd have to be much richer to ever pay it off the whole amount before it's written off anyway. I'm currently not on track to pay off my loan before it gets written off, but in a way I prefer having a smaller loan that I have to pay more off of, if my earnings do increase at least I could be rid of the debt burden sooner.

&gt;• How safe do you feel now when cycling around your town or city? Has this feeling improved from the past?

To be honest I don't feel safe at all.  There is almost no provision for cyclists in the town (Cleethorpes and Grimsby both). Most side roads are narrow turn-of-last-century terraced streets with sharp blind junctions and the main roads are only slightly wider.  There are a few junctions with traffic lights that have six feet blocked out for cyclists but they are mostly ignored by motorists at the busier times of the day.  Getting from say the beach at Cleethorpes to Grimsby's town centre means either riding on one of two busy main roads with no cycle provision or taking to the side streets that are usually reduced to single carriageway thanks to on-street parking.  Either way you'll need to cross the railway which is choice of pedestrian footbridge with no cycle channel or dual-carriageway bridge/traffic light/roundabout combination. 

&gt;• What kind of cyclist would you regard yourself as - a regular commuter during weekday mornings and evenings, or someone who rides as a serious hobby in your spare time? Perhaps a non-committal hobby cyclist every now and again?

I used to be a regular commuter and hobby cyclist in my home town (Peterborough, which had excellent cycling facilities).  I think I've cycled maybe five times in the last seven years since moving.

true,SCFoximus,troughton,Troughton,"I read the script a long time ago and it's... okay. The first quarter of it we don't really even see The Doctor, just sort of plunged into a world that seems inconsistent with the rest of the show (though, it was done intentionally), with The Doctor stumbling around in that world. Then the rest of the story just plays out as if it is a 4th Doctor story with Ace (sans her memories of being Ace) and the Brig as his companions. 

Truly, it is not really much of a ""multi-Doctor"" story. The 3rd Doctor basically just has a cameo (which makes sense as it was written in at the last moment), and the 6th Doctor's scene just seems out of place. Both scenes just have little need to be there, and don't do much for the story, except for each having *one line* mentioned towards the end. The 5th Doctor, on the other hand, gets the best section of the ""extra"" Doctors, and is the part of the whole script that actually felt like it was Doctor Who. We actually get to see him in he middle of an adventure, whereas the 3rd and 6th Doctors just breifly impart a piece of knowledge. The 7th Doctor had the next best part and works his way in at the end, really tying the story together in its final moments.

The main antogonist's plotline is a bit too convoluted, and doesn't all fit together, with many of their ""evil"" plans (which the writers focused on way too often in the first half) winding up as wholly unimportant by the latter half, to the point where they are never talked about or mentioned once The Doctor actually starts doing things.

As a ""30th Anniversary Special"", it did a good job bringing back the Brigadier, Daleks, Cybermen, and even the Yeti, but because it was so centered on the 4th Doctor, it only felt as much of a celebration of the 30 years of the show as *Day of the Doctor* did ""representing"" all 50 years. Yes, it would have been neat to see the Doctor's (and the Brig) step back into their shoes, and I would have much preferred this over *Dimensions in Time*, but just as with that story, I think fans would have been disappointed with this to some degree.

It seems the link I've had saved is still active, so if anybody want to read it here is a link to the script:

&gt;""The fee for Torres was dependent on what Newcastle asked for Carroll,"" Henry said, explaining that Liverpool wanted Carroll, plus £15m, to replace Torres.

Edit: a bit more context, from a Comolli interview:

&gt;The way we looked at it we were selling two players, Fernando Torres and Ryan Babel, and we were bringing two in, Luis Suarez and Carroll, and we were making a profit and the wage bill was coming down as well. **It was a four-player deal.**

I'm willing to believe what these two are saying in their interviews. The point being, taking the Carroll purchase in isolation, or the Torres sale in isolation, completely misses the point of how the deals were reached and thought about financially by the club. You can criticise the club for actually going through with the Carroll deal once they'd got Chelsea to agree to £50m for Torres, rather than pocketing most of the money (i.e. the £35m that was for Carroll), but that's a different point to saying we had the money in our pocket and getting taken advantage of. We took advantage of Chelsea to drive the price up to £50m, via Newcastle.

Problem is, LFC had a director of football not too long ago and imo FSG will be very cautious about a similar scenario again.

&gt;**Spooks** (known as **MI-5** in some countries) is a [British television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_television) drama series that originally aired on [BBC One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) from 13 May 2002 to 23 October 2011, consisting of 10 series. The title is a popular [colloquialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialism) for [spies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage), and the series follows the work of a group of [MI5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5) officers based at the service's [Thames House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_House) headquarters, in a highly secure suite of offices known as The Grid. It is notable for both its high production value, and its use of popular guest actors. In the United States, the show is broadcast under the title **MI-5**. In Canada, the programme originally aired as MI5 but now airs on [BBC Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Canada) as Spooks.

true,PNUKGuy,null,null,"OK, As I used to write these public notices I'd like to add a few comments.

As stated, local newspaper circulation has been declining steadily. However, even the ones that still have large readerships are regularly avoided as they charge too much. Adverts are often placed in obscure local papers to reduce costs. The reach is even lower than you think.

Additionally, because papers are charging more for Statutory Adverts than regular adverts (Up to 3 times the rate per cm. Source http://www.lgiu.org.uk/2012/09/11/public-notices-the-case-for-radical-reform-part-1/ ) the information in them is the bare legal minimum, in the lowest allowed typeset. It isn't accessible to a lot of people with even minor eyesight problems. And it's in English only.

Moving it online means the notices will reach a greater proportion of the population, will be able to contain much more information, allow use of accessibility and translation software, be archived, allow email alerts (for anyone that interested in local affairs!) all whilst making savings of 95% on the public notices advertising budgets.

Which is entirely my point about why the public don't really give a fuck.  If we spent our entire lives worrying about ""what ifs"" we'd never leave the house.  At the end of the day, the question I would ask is ""Are David Cameron, the UK Government and the people who work for organizations such as MI5 and MI6 hell bent one some campaign to suppress the public consciousness, turn the country into a totalitarian state, and have total control over the thoughts and actions of the citizen population?  Or have they just found a way which could potentially make their life easier in identifying people who pose a threat to national security, and are largely focused (even if reddit thinks otherwise) on radical religious extremists and people who are a genuine danger to our daily lives?""

You can complain about how it could be abused all you want.  Your local GP could abuse your medical records if they so chose.  But they don't because it's not really in their interests, or directly related to what they're trying to achieve.  I don't particularly think those gathering data are any different.  Sure, they do it without permission, but are they a threat to me or anyone else?  Nah... not really.  And if it nets an occasional bomber from time to time, no real harm done.

You're welcome to disagree.  Personally, I don't waste my time stressing about it, and I think I'm far happier for it.

Edit: I should probably declare a small interest in that my father used to work for GCHQ, so you could accuse me of bias.  But by and large everyone I've met who worked there is a perfectly normal individual just like you and me.  Even the ones that probably practice the dark arts.  I know reddit loves to think they're evil, sinister people who are plotting our downfall, but that's just reddit for you.

true,hippocratic_oaf,null,null,"To be honest it depends on the type of education you want. Oxbridge run a preclinical course where you study science for three years then do clinical work after (potentially not at the same uni). When I applied I pick my choices on league table place but in the end chose not to go to Cambridge. The course is good but in my experience it isn't as good as a fully integrated course where the preclinical science is based around clinical medicine. You also should think about whether or not you want to do a BSc during the course, the teaching style you want (Manchester is PBL based with almost no lectures) and what the city you'll be living in is like. 
There's a lot more to university than league tables and a lot of how you develop in to a doctor will come from things outside the classroom. 
Personally I chose Imperial College School of Medicine (ICSM) because its an integrated course, the teaching is world class (we get lots of students coming from other universities like Oxbridge to finish their training), the hospital you will be based at are part of North West Thames which has the highest number of applicants for junior doctor posts, it is the only medical school to have its own student union that is separate from the main university union and you'll end up living in West London.

You'll need at least £150,000 for fees and living, which you will have to borrow at home if your parents don't have the cash. There are no scholarships, unless you can convince the NZ govt to sponsor you.

Also, not every school will accept non-EU students.

After you graduate, you will be able to work for 2 years and then that's it, go home (or you have to apply to the least popular specialties). The only way out is to get married / get a cohabiting partner with a good job.

For local students, once you are a doctor, it really doesn't matter where you studied. However, if you want to work outside the EU, then reputation of your medical school is everything.

I know Fox let the team down a lot but he still played a considerable amount and with him gone then Matt Targett should be seeing some sporadic game time in the near future.

With Osvaldo gone (hallelujah!) then the team will have to re-shape eventually as Lambert cant carry that role on his own. Obviously the first choice XI will be Lambert CF, Lallana RW and J-Rod LW with Gallagher as an immediate replacement for the striker. Alternatives would then J-Rod CF, Lallana LW and JWP RW or RAM. Hopefully the space in numbers means that Isgrove will have some opportunities. 

The thing that im most looking forward to is the return of Wanyama, who was on the bench against Arsenal. Will Cork lose out? I think he's done more than enough to build up an argument for keeping his spot and hopefully that will bring out the best in both players.

In theory, yes. In practice I think the whole 'local representative' thing is a crock of shit. The chances are you are in a safe seat so your MP can safely ignore your needs while taking back handers and dinners from corporate/union^* sponsors before leaving via the revolving door. And at the end of the day decisions are made by the cabinet with MPs having little or no say. Besides, how often have you asked your MP for help?

What use, then, is an MP that truly agrees with you on an issue who is then whipped into towing the party line? At the end of the day, I'd vote for an MP I didn't 100% agree with if it meant a cabinet that I did agree with.

true,bananaheroin,null,null,"Raheem labelled Reds' 'man of steel'

Few players have ever belied their seemingly diminutive physical stature with the same consistency as Raheem Sterling, who shows such levels of strength that his manager has joked the winger is 'made of steel'.

While searing pace, ability to dribble at speed and interplay with fellow Liverpool forwards are clearly a selection of the No.31's greatest assets, the 19-year-old also possesses power in abundance.

Barely a game passes by in which Sterling does not outmuscle an opponent, combining upper body strength with a low centre of gravity to bamboozle his marker and spring into space behind the backline.

It's an attribute which has not gone unnoticed by Brendan Rodgers and, following another impeccable display during the derby triumph over Everton, the boss took time to share his delight with the England international's progress.

""Young Raheem has barely had a mention but I thought he was absolutely outstanding,"" the Northern Irishman commented in reference to Tuesday night.

""This kid has only just turned 19 years of age and was up against arguably the best left-back in the country at the moment.

""I'm sure if you were to ask Leighton Baines he would say he had a really, really difficult night. Raheem was so dangerous with his pace.

""He's one of the strongest players I've ever known - that's what people find remarkable. I don't think he's got bones in his body, it's like he's made of steel. He has an incredible physique for a young guy.

""He also has toughness in his brain. Mentally, he's very strong. He is improving his technique and he needs to improve his goal return but that will come.

""He is still so young but his performance level at the minute is at such a high level. He's happy, he's confident and he's a joy to work with.""



Since being reinstated to Rodgers' starting line-up for the journey to Hull City on December 1, Sterling has evoked memories of the impressive performances he contributed when initially bursting onto the first-team scene.

His importance can perhaps be reflected by the special plans devised by the boss in the days leading up to Everton's visit to glean the maximum productivity from the young forward.

The 41-year-old explained: ""That side of the field against Everton was one of the key areas tactically for us.

""One of the jobs for Raheem and Jon Flanagan was to block up that space. They did that really well and obviously were a great threat going forward too.

""That has been one of the things which has really impressed me about Raheem.  Something I found out early on when I came in here was his ability to take things on board, like when to press.

""My preparation for the derby started leading into the Bournemouth game. My plan was to play Raheem there so I wanted to rest him for Bournemouth because he was going to have a big job against Everton.

""Raheem has got a lot of personality for a youngster. You don't make your debut at 17 for a club like Liverpool if you are shy and withdrawn. Things have happened very quickly for him in his career and I think there's been an adjustment to that.

""He will still have his off days and difficult moments but he's a wonderful kid. I've been really impressed with how quickly he has taken on the tactical element of the game and he has regained a lot of his focus over the last number of months.""",0,1391256726,null,0,false,0,cf4bz9c,t3_1wq1ii,t1_cf4bz9c,t3_1wq1ii,null,1432204096,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

In Liverpool's preferred 4-3-3 system Lucas fits that central role perfectly and strikes a key balance in the team.

Virgin - Legacy network, increasing capacity at local level means installing additional equipment in the streets and laying in new cables, question is why will they not do this?

BT - Currently rolling out their FTTC and FTTP products, using 21cn network which has high capacity backhaul.

TalkTalk - Currently rolling out FTTC (using BT Infinity network) has own backbone network that was enhanced several years ago and has high capacity backhaul.


The main issues that people have with BT/TalkTalk tends to be the 'last Mile' connection which is owned by Openreach, for example BT have installed FTTC in areas where the lines are Aluminium Cable, the VDSL loss over this is drastic and results in poor FTTC rates.

Some users are getting poor rates due to their own internal set ups as well.

It's not too hard to avoid a processed snack food in your child's lunch and if other children see it, it will only cause headaches for the teachers and staff. I'm sure that the school in question has offered guidance as to what would be suitable and some good ideas for parents and it's not fair that one family choose to decline to support of the policy.

We hardly had the ball, and whenever we did, we struggled to keep it.  Panic passing because we were being closed down well, and being completely flooded in the centre of the park with no great passing options or movement were the exact same problems with our first game.

To be honest, I don't think Sherwood's done amazingly well so far.  He's been lucky because AVB had us playing so badly that anyone would've been a breath of fresh air.  He's had some relatively easy matches in charge, but the two games against Arsenal and City have seen us barely in the game.

What I can see being the case is that yet again, we refused to pay the valuation of the player. Instead of offering the £16m and thus triggering the release clause, we probably offered £12m with the other £4m being paid over a period of time, which the owner refused.

I would look at the bright side as ""hey, at least we have an extra £16m to spend in the summer"", but can you guys see that changing anything? We're happy to cough up for squad players (Borini, Aspas, Luis Alberto, Allen) but when it comes to players that would come in and make an impact on the first team (Dempsey, Sigurdsson, Mkhitaryan, Costa, Willian, Salah, Konoplyanka) we refuse to pay their club's valuation.

They really don't want to more money into the club at this point and, as a investment company, that may make sense to them. 

The problem is that as a fan of the club they are obviously not backing the manager with funds and the transfer committee seems to be hamstrung by unrealistic restrictions being placed on them by the owner's lack of investment. 

Also, why do people always assume that fans who want a little more from FSG expect oil money lavish transfers. I for one certainly don't.  

I do wish the owners would invest in the club a little more from their own funds to strengthen the teams position until we can be self sufficient at the higgest level.

No, Hoolahan is a good player. Experienced and would do well for Villa for at least two seasons. Has good vision, can pick a pass and is able to unlock defenses. Besides, 1 million isn't a lot of money (in football that is!)

Relegation is going to get hot, if we lose a few games Villa can easily be sucked into it. I'm happy with 10th. I'd be happy if we stayed there all season. It shows progress and from 10th Villa can push forward next season.

true,Schlagv,null,null,"Productivity is anti-wage growth. What controls wages and GDP growth is energy production today.

GDP is created by labour, energy and ressources. In communism (or state capitalism), capital is allocated by the state, in market capitalism it is allocated though the market equilibrium.

Before 1973 (first oil crisis), labour was the limiting factor and immigration + women were used to boost production by increasing the job market size, so people succeded at unionizing and negociating together.

After 1973, energy is the limited factor. Slowly the global energy production growth decreased, leading to structural enemployment in developped countries. It was made worst by immigration that wasn't stopped and by progress in transportation that enabled offshoring. Today we have a gigantic pool of unused workers competing each against the other, instead of together vs the employers (aka holy job creators).

To inverse the rise of inequalities, we need an energy production growth (about 0% in the developped world currently) higher than the productivity growth (about 3% currently, stable for decades). Solar could achieve this. Otherwize, inequalities will rise until there is enough civil unrest to push to a reduction of inequality through taxation (the thing we are taught to think as immoral).",0,1391263536,null,0,1391263887,0,cf4d2ur,t3_1wnkh4,t1_cf4d2ur,t1_cf4c8ff,null,1432204606,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think the closest to a collective is that Reddit's main demographic is students and professions. You could generalise to say that both those two groups are more likely to research before voting, and get their news from multiple sources, which in turn could mean they're more educated and slightly less likely to go with an opinion pushed by the media.

Here in Portsmouth it's quite similar, maybe slightly better. They have good infrsstructure along the searont, with parking space segregated from cycle paths by kerbs qand hatched areas, but I don't really agree with the shaping of the paths. They're both on one side of the road and cycling West to East along the island they expect you to get on the path far too early. The junction before they switch you to the cycle area is perfectly safe. There's also thngs like cycle paths on roads with large island in the middle that prevent cars from overtaking safely. There should really be signage to indicate riders to cycle in the middle. I decided to ride in the path with a car behind me thinking theyu wouldn't overtake but they did, and they came bloody close in doing so. The island was about 7 car lengths

Everywhere else it's standard, almost non-existent infrastructure. Cycle paths on ppavements that people walk in, cycle paths that cars park in, no paths at all, that sort of thing.

You're not taking into account the potential benefits of the child being exposed to different choices in school time. I remember myself seeing kids with stuff that I'd never seen and got to try all sorts of new stuff and then my Mum could prepare that for me.

&gt; if anything it will just make you less productive as your energy level will be depleted during school time, as your insulin levels etc are used to sugar etc post school time.

I think you're making assumptions about what the children are eating. 

&gt; the school has no area of responsibility for forcing children to eat what they say

The school aren't forcing anyone ""to eat what they say"". It's not as if they're actually force feeding the children. The parents have simply been asked to provide something healthy and nutritious, that's a pretty huge area of food to work with and I'm sure processed snack food were merely on a ""no"" list.

its by virtue of the difficulty of getting the data.

true,Saiing,cnty-england,UK -&gt; Japan,"&gt;The main bit I want to disagree with is this suggestion that Reddit has a shared opinion. It's hard to try and say there is a collective opinion when you're taking about such a huge number of people. You, for one, do not share that opinion.

This kind if argument comes up a lot on this site, and to be honest I find it a bit pointless and sidetracking.  When some says ""British people like to drink tea and watch football"", they're obviously not describing every last citizen of the UK.  They're merely observing the prevailing or most common behavior that tends to present itself most strongly.  Go and try writing a comment in any pro-snowden or anti-surveillance submission that puts a counter-argument, no matter how well reasoned and see how long it stays visible before disappearing into the minuses.  Not long, and worse still it'll often be buried out of sight without even a single reply, as if to say ""we don't even tolerate that kind of idea here.""

So, of course I don't think every single person in reddit is of the same opinion. But neither do I think it's inaccurate to suggest that there is a very strong and fairly predictable hive mind mentality that is largely unable to accept alternative views, despite the fact that many people here think themselves to be pro-free speech and defenders of individual rights.  Frankly, I'd rather live in the world as it is now, than a world modelled on reddit's way of doing things. 

&gt;these are people, after after all, and will do what they need to succeed

Ok, here's a straightforward question for you.  What are they trying to succeed at?  What exactly is the end game for these surveillance overlords?

absolutely, the term ""qualified nutritionist"" was for convenience, i didnt actually mean a nutritionist, its just easier than writing a paragraph on the scientific method and its application to nutrition.

nutrition is an area people hold false certainties but the actual foundations are baseless or sketchy at best.

Most people don't understand the requirements to actually provide a link or determine claim X is true. it takes decades and millions of pounds and a sample size of hundreds of thousands in some cases millions.

there are not the resources to conduct it, so people who claim false authority on nutrition I very much have a problem with.

Everyone thinks they know what is right about nutrition but they do not, people who actually conduct the research over the many decades of a study (there have been a few) know how tenuous the link is and how many caveats there are to each claim.

He needed to use the money up and told her to treat us (because he was in the doghouse with all of us but that's another story!). He verified this to the staff and we got accused of BULLYING as well.

Anyway, thank you for this. I appreciate it more than you know. In my opinion, RTD may have reached for the deus ex machina often but I don't have too much of a problem with that seeing as that is how I view the Doctor. He is quite literally a god (or Lord, whatever) who walks out of a machine to save the day. That's what I loved about Davies- he got the characters. He understood the Doctor. Moffat seems to be aware the Doctor is a character and maybe saw a picture of him once and went off that. 12 is an immature child, River has no depth, Amy is a brat, Rory is a pushover with no real arc, Clara is just a directionless mess. I can't enjoy a character driven story with no character development. He also doesn't follow his own rules and that bugs the crap out of me.

That's just how I view it and I realize some people may not agree. I really do like Doctor Who. In fact Pirate, one of the main characters, is an avid Whovian. He has a pet owl named Doctor Whoo (he found him in a phone booth in London). So I don't dislike Who at all! I am just not a fan of what Moffat has done to it.

The point isn't that the gallery wanted to spend £10m on 8 boxes, though. It's that £10m is what they think someone would pay for it. That value is based on a combination of factors; the actual cost of materials (relatively scant in this case, substantial in the case of something like Damian Hirst's [*'For the Love of God'*](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6d/Hirst-Love-Of-God.jpg) (which is in part the concept behind that particular piece)), the prestige of the artist and overall quality of their oeuvre (Judd is very well-known in minimalist art circles) and whether they will be making any more of it (Judd won't - he's dead) and the artistic and aesthetic qualities and ideas and the 'craft' of the piece itself.

The art market is by far the silliest part of the art world. People often bemoan what they disdainfully lump together as 'modern art'. I don't think that people *actually* object to the idea that an arrangement of objects like Tracy Emin's controversial ['My Bed'](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Emin-My-Bed.jpg) can provoke contemplation and introspection. More uncomfortable for people is the notion that such an arrangement is worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, or millions in the case of the Judd piece in the article, Untitled 1980. I would agree with them, but the value is based on *what people will pay.* And there are people out there with the wealth and bacchic selfishness to spend that much money on pieces of art, vastly more than the majority of people will earn in their entire lifetimes even. That is offensive, but it's not the art's fault. It's the buyers' fault.

No players are in their respective positions. Soldado looks absolutely gormless. Lennon has been invisible, again. Dawson is a liability. Walker looks like he doesn't know where to play.

Our midfield pairing of Bentaleb and Paulinho is not able to retain possession whatsoever. Whenever the ball is played from midfield it either hits the wall of defence Hull are effectively playing or it floats out to the wings in which Lennon, nor Eriksen seem to be actually be positioned in.

Forgive me if this is an overreaction, but we simply cannot afford to display this level of tactical ineptitude at this part of the season. Whilst completely opposite in playing philosophy and tactical decisions, Sherwood and AVB have one thing in common - their complete inflexibility to change the run of play, whether this be during the game, or over a course of games.

Sherwood has shown his team selection and tactics today to be completely ineffective in recycling possession, positioning, and attacking. I think that a Soldado/Adebayor combo in this instance isn't benefiting our attack, come to think of it, I don't think they've played a pass to each other (a meaningful one at least). I think Paulinho and Eriksen are the ones that could make a real impact on the game today, and in my eyes one of Soldado/Adebayor should be taken off and replaced with Capoue to accommodate a slightly more fluid style of play and freedom from either of those two.

As said before, Hull aren't strictly playing a 3-5-2 but now they are a goal ahead, we are not seeing much attacking wing play from Hull - instead they are crowding the centre of midfield and tracking back when needed to.

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Virgin - Legacy network, increasing capacity at local level means installing additional equipment in the streets and laying in new cables, question is why will they not do this?

The problem is twofold: A lack of bandwidth from street cabinet to the hub site and all services on that cabinet are shared contention (DOCSIS 3). This means the problems are extremely localised and also terrible for *all* users when it does happen. Blowing additional / higher spec fibre is expensive as is the hardware to use it, plus it's difficult to justify / care about individual cabinets when it only effects a few dozen subscribers.

&gt;BT - Currently rolling out their FTTC and FTTP products, using 21cn network which has high capacity backhaul.

Still contended but the contention is more broadly spread. The WBC (21CN) backhaul between the exchange and the core network is rated for N thousand connections, meaning the contention is spread over thousands of users instead of tens. It's easier to justify upgrading the backhaul if it's impacting thousands rather than dozens. The same applies for Talk Talk (different Core network to BT's).

&gt;Long story short? shop around and get off Virgin, both BT and TalkTalk offer TV packages on their lines now which can compete with Virgin, both have their up side and Down Sides.

Or someone good like Zen or AAISP. :)

&gt;**Offside** (sometimes known as offsides) is a [law in association football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football\)) which states that if a player is in an offside position when the ball is touched or played by a team-mate, the player may not become actively involved in the play. A player is in an offside position when closer to the opponent's [goal line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_line_(association_football\)) than both the ball and the second-to-last defender (which is usually the last outfield player), and also in the opponent's half of the [pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football_pitch). ""Offside position"" is a matter of fact, whereas committing an ""offside offence"" occurs when a player is ""actively involved"" and is subject to the interpretation of the referee. Goals scored after committing an offside offence are nullified if caught by the referee.

I think she knows more than she lets on, and could be culpable as an accessory or criminally negligent. However, that is a bit hard to prove one way or another. She definitely shows some signs of guilt and erratic behavior.

The DNA evidence is extremely weak, and given other cues I don't think she would be competent enough to scrub the scene of evidence linking her involvement while leaving that of others.

The twisted sex game story was completely silly, and the tactics of the prosecution underminded.

A lot of different things could have happened. Guede was their drug hookup, they smoked out or did other drugs, you hear screaming upstairs but don't link it to murder. Perhaps rough sex, a movie? People don't think about ""omg! a murder is going on!""

It is a great shame how the British media are so backwards in their attitudes and tied themselves in knots handing our righteous condemnation to Terry. Suarez's form this season has lead to his misdemeanor's being reduced to a mere footnote; with JT they always get mentioned first, even if it's just in articles saying he had a good game it's like a rule that you need to slight his character as well.

When he retires, people with mourn the derth of 'old fashioned', passionate English centre halves. And only then will they start to appreciate what a player he has been. I even think he if someone is willing to give him a chance, he would be a quality pundit, if he doesn't go straight into management.

Let's take a moment to appreciate this piece of shit from Paul Hayward, who effectively wrote of Terry over 2 years ago: 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/8905276/Paul-Hayward-Chelseas-John-Terry-rages-with-little-effect-against-the-dying-of-the-light.html

We are so lucky to have a captain who has been with the club so long, a link to the days before Abramovich, who cleaned the first team player's boots when he was younger. Someone who understands and loves Chelsea, but is also a world class defender and a mainstay of the greatest team in our history. 

Even if no one else can appreciate him, we love him enough to make up for it!

In terms of cost and speed (for the majority) things are pretty good in the UK. The trouble for network providers is that customers have notional amounts attached to what they're willing to spend on connectivity, regardless of it's actual value to them. They see a headline figure of 100Mbit/s and think that will always be on tap. I would be surprised if they were allocated more than 300kbit/s in the core network - that figure is your usage averaged out over a month, 300kbit/s is roughly 100GB a month. A full 100Mbit of dedicated bandwidth is more than 32TB of traffic per month.

Upgrading infrastructure like this is expensive, especially when we're talking about roadworks which can cost upwards of £20,000 per day. BT tried more expensive residential connections (£40+ pcm) and the uptake was minimal.

Not much to report about this month as game time appears hard to find for our loanees. This is due to a combination of factors. Some, like **Wallace** and **Cristian Cuevas** appear to be left completely out in the cold all season, and it doesn't look like they'll be getting many appearances at their current clubs. Others, like **Josh McEachran**, **Nathaniel Chalobah** and **Gaël Kakuta** have switched clubs this window and are simply settling into their new environments. This hasn't been the case for **Patrick Bamford** at Derby though, as he has made the step up to Championship football brilliantly, scoring in his last three games. **Thibaut Courtois** continues to be imperious in goal for title chasing Atlético Madrid, conceding only five goals this month and saving a penalty. A number of players are new to the loan roundup, while some will be gone from the next. **Ryan Bertrand**, **Kenneth Omeruo** and **Kurt Zouma** are some of the notable additions, while **Sam Walker** has left the club and it is unlikely **Sam Hutchinson** will find another home before his contract ends in the Summer.",0,1391272846,null,0,false,0,cf4fniu,t3_1wqfrb,t1_cf4fniu,t3_1wqfrb,null,1432205871,10,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,10

&gt;With all due respect you must be out of your mind if you think Alessandro Nesta was ""only at the top for about 4 or 5 years"". That is absolutely ludicrous.

Why is that? Do you not know that he suffered a serious injury around 06 or so and then only had one really good season after that?

&gt; Lúcio was brilliant at three separate clubs. He also played a big role in Brasil's 2002 World Cup success and their Confederations Cup successes in 2005 and 2009. He was not overrated at all; you can't be serious when you say that. He's one of the very few defenders to have bullied Didier Drogba in his prime.

Again, Lucio was playing in a league that was no where near the standard of the Premier League. Also, international form isn't something that you can create a baseline with to evaluate a player. If that was the case Podolski should be considered world-class with all the goals he's scored for Germany, but he's not even close to being at that level. He bullied Drogba when at Inter - at the age of 32.

&gt;Ferdinand, not an all-around central defender? Absurd. Not only was he a superb defender, he had been recognised as the best ball-playing central defender to hail from England since Bobby Moore.

Agreed, but he is not the leader that Terry is. Also, his strengths lie in marking/tackling rather than heading the ball. Compare that to Terry and Terry is excellent at almost everything, including heading the ball. Terry was one of the few players who headed the ball clear by directing his headers to his team-mates - even when clearing his area.

&gt; ""Everton 3-0 Liverpool"" is the DVD that every Everton fan around the globe should own, detailing the hammering that the blues gave the reds on September 9th 2006.
There is really nothing quite like a Merseyside Derby to ignite the passion of Everton and Liverpool fans. Often controversial, always fiercely contested, ongoing bragging rights around town are the ultimate prizes for the team that comes out on top. When it's your team and the scoreline is 3-0, you know it's something special.
Not only would a win over their near neighbours and bitter enemies Liverpool signify a great night out on Merseyside for all Evertonians, but it would also put The Toffees top of the Premiership during the 2006 / 2007 season. What a dream ticket! Everton started the game like they really meant business and it was no surprise that they took the lead through the excellent Tim Cahill of Australia. Supporters began to believe when just over 10 minutes later, new signing from Crystal Palace, Andy Johnson, doubled the advantage before half-time. The second period saw Liverpool with the lion's share of possession, but defensively The Blues were sound and with a last-minute breakaway, Johnson wrapped the game up. 3-0 was the final score, the biggest winning margin for 42 years. A day to remember forever.
This is a must-have DVD for Evertonians, celebrating one of the team's greatest ever wins over Liverpool, by 3 goals to 0 at Goodison Park in 2006.

Playing Spurs is incredibly easy due to their unbalanced tactics, misfiring strikers, and predictable ball movement and set up. Having trouble scoring? Well, if you have any semblance of pace, creativity, quick passing, you're in luck! If not, as long as you can hoof the ball up the pitch like a Sunday League side, you're in the clear! with their horrible team defense and inability to stay in shape, the one-on-ones are nearly guaranteed!

Oh, you're conceding too much? Don't worry, Soldado is no Aguero. Come to think of it, he's no Jozy Altidore. All you have to do is set up a decently set up defense on the top of the box and pack it in, and they won't score!

Lennon was absent at best.  Kept wandering over to the left side for whatever reason.  I have no clue what he was doing there.  Eriksen did fine, but we really need to play him through the center.  We have no balance because of our lack of a real wide player on that left flank.

An Englishman, welshman and west indian are in hospital, waiting for their wives to give birth. There is quite a bit of pacing up and down when the nurse comes out and happily announces that they are all fathers of bouncing baby boys.

""There's just one problem,"" she says. ""Because they were all born at the same time, we got the tags mixed up and we don't know which baby belongs to whom. Would you, as their fathers, mind coming to identify them?"" The men agree and walk into the delivery room and look at the babies.

Immediately the Englishman stoops down and picks up the black baby. ""Yes, this is definitely my baby,"" he says confidently.
""Um, excuse me,"" says the west indian, ""but I think it's fairly obvious that this is my son.""
The Englishman pulls him aside and says, ""I see where you're coming from, mate, but one of these babies is welsh and I'm not prepared to take the risk.""

A welshman, a sheep, and a dog were survivors of a terrible shipwreck. They found themselves stranded on a desert island.

After being there a while, they got into the habit of going to the beach every evening to watch the sun go down. One particular evening, the sky was red with beautiful cirrus clouds, the breeze was warm and gentle; a perfect night for romance.

As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the welshman. Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. But the dog got jealous, growling fiercely until the welshman took his arm from around the sheep. After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling.

A few weeks passed by, and lo and behold, there was another shipwreck. The only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the most beautiful woman the welshman had ever seen. She was in a pretty bad way when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed her back to health. When the young maiden was well enough, they introduced her to their evening beach ritual. It was another beautiful evening: red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze; perfect for a night of romance. 

Pretty soon, the welshman started to get ""those feelings"" again. He fought them as long as he could, but he finally gave in and leaned over to the young woman, cautiously, and whispered in her ear...

""could you take the dog for a walk?""

* When Billie Piper wanted to leave the show, Davies had to invent an inaccessible parallel dimension to do it. 

* The Whole Utopia, Sound of Drums and Last of the Time Lords storyline is one giant Deus Ex Machina. 

* At the end of the fourth season, Davies invented a previously unknown super power so Donna can leave the show.

That was, for me, his biggest mistake today. He won several corners and setup others who also passed up on having a shot. Most impressively for me was in the 69th minute when Hull was breaking after an extended period of being in possession around their box and Soldado sprinted from box to box to cover. Who else put in that run for the team? Later he had that sexy flick to Eriksen when we were countering and made up 50 yards to come down and again earn us another corner. Why aren't questions being asked of Lennon, Walker and Rose for not providing any width? Why is it that Soldado played in more crosses than Lennon, Walker and Rose?

You see, hope is a bitch. 

It's been several years now since we put in a good run in the league. People knew that with shitty troubles at the board level, manager level and top players leaving what we were expecting out of every season. Nothing basically. We knew times were tough. Specially with the two cowboys making it harder by each passing day.

We were edged out from winning the league by a few points. We came second. Things were looking up. With a few good, shrewd signings we could achieve the unthinkable. Hope, you see. 

The Boss then left us. It was a massive blow. 2008 was a good year. 2009, we hoped.

We didnt recover. Our best players were leaving. We finally got bought by the new owners and the threat of administration was gone. We hoped things we going to get better. Hope. 

Roy Hodgson came in. And went. Replaced by the King. We hoped. He IS Liverpool FC, everything this club embodies. Signings were made, disastrous ones. Keep in mind we were a mid table team now. 6th and 7th was what we as supporters were looking at realistically. 

Kenny left. 

Brendan comes in. New start. Suarez, Sturridge, Coutinho, Sakho. things look up. After several years, we looked like we could run with the big boys again. As supporters we hoped again. Hoped that if we aim for the stars we'll hit the roof. 4th is realistic to us. After some choppy results we're back in the running. 

Transfer window comes by. We hope that a few good signings, shrewd ones will push us up a notch. We're raping defences apart, scoring for fun. We need to shore up one or 2  key areas, and we could think of achieving the unthinkable. 

Window goes by. Nothing happens. We hoped it would. 

2008 was similar. We could have made the right signings and be up another level. Didnt happen. 2014 is similar, I pray to every diety or power out there that we secure a top 4 spot. If we dont, we're looking at another spell of about 4 years to recovery. We hoped things would get better. 

2008 and 2014 the outcome of the transfer windows have been similar. Only the circumstances have changed a bit. 

We're still recovering. I hope we dont need another 5 years to 'recover' from the mistakes of this window.

I hope. ",0,1391275459,null,0,false,0,cf4gmno,t3_1wq54h,t1_cf4gmno,t1_cf4cw4m,null,1435507624,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

Astonishingly, GFH gave control to Cellino before the deal was completed and naturally he did what he wanted, which involved getting his lawyer to tell McDermott and Hunt (the acting CEO) that they'd been sacked. GFH probably knew that this was what Cellino wanted to do, but they probably hadn't anticipated that he would pull the trigger as soon as possible.

Since GFH are in charge, that makes them liable for this entire situation and McDermott should rightly be able to take them to court over it, considering that he's been sacked as far as he's concerned. However, since it was never ratified by the actual board members, the sacking never took place and GFH can reverse the decision and pretend that it never happened - which is exactly what they're trying to do, to prevent being sued. And if McDermott had turned up today, he would either be confirming this by managing the team or potentially opening grounds for rightful termination by being in the stadium but not managing the team.

McDermott made the right decision to stay away and shouldn't accept GFH's statement, in my opinion. Not when Cellino will just sack him for real once he genuinely assumes control of the club.

You think Tim could get to the level of the best manager in history after mentoring under LVG?

That is honestly giving too much credit to Tim and nowhere close to enough credit to SAF. 

Fergie won the PL 13 times, the FA Cup 5, the League Cup 4, Champions League 2....that is astounding, absolutely astounding in terms of accomplishments, it will likely never be matched.

Look at the coaches around now...Even Mou isn't on the same level of SAF and has a huge distance to cover to reach that level.  Wenger may be the only one you could actually compare to SAF and he spent most of his tenure at Arsenal behind SAF and United.

If we could get Tim to be the next 'Arry, that would be a really impressive accomplishment.  'Arry gets a fair share of flack around here, but he has had a very good career as a manager.

true,kde01,king,,"Seems a fair few people in this sub are lashing out at the manager/his decisions (including playing Bentaleb) unfairly.

He made a bad decision in not swapping out any players, but Bentaleb was the right choice. I personally would have taken out Paulinho for Capoue, Soldado for Gylfi, and Lennon for Chadli to chase the winning goal. I don't see how we would have benefited from Capoue over Bentaleb. Bentaleb's passing was on point today, and he was everywhere in the midfield. 

I don't see much of an issue with the lineup he chose, either. He picked what he thought was the best XI available, and we all would have agreed I think (minus the anti-Bentaleb bandwagon that wants to pin everything on this kid).

He hasn't managed at this level before and he is going to make a lot of mistakes before getting better. Look at Moyes. Did fantastic at Everton for so long, now seems like he has no idea what he's doing at United. You're going to make a lot of mistakes before you get better. Even City at home early on in the season is testament to that. 

Get behind the manager, get behind the club, and get behind the players. Stop bitching that you want Sherwood out or that Bentaleb is terrible. Just give that a rest and support Spurs. Your complaining is infectious and gets to other people in this sub. You take the draw and move on.

Besides, is 5th really that bad? You'll get your wish - Sherwood will be replaced. If we get fourth, you'll get your CL. Either way, you win. The only negative result for the complainers is relegation, and we're more likely to win the league than we are to be relegated.

It's all about learning the foundation, which he obviously has, and then building upon that. If he is as smart as the people that surround him think then it will not be too hard for him to learn Van Gaal's strategies and apply them to his own system.

I imagine Moyes is trying to change Uniteds style, the problem he will have is that Rooney and Van Persie will be heading into the last stages of their careers and he has to replace them both in order to persist with a new system, so that is likely to be a huge outlay which will stop them plugging the holes in their midfield and defense.

Or alternatively (and more likely) they build from the back and struggle to score whenever Van Persie or Rooney picks up an injury, United fans will despise this style as it is dreadful to watch and I reckon Moyes will get the sack.

I don't think Moffat was too bad with deus ex machina and when he did I think he did it right. The cybermen dimension was made and we were eased into it having a whole plot about the ghosts first. The theme of that was human pride leads to human error. Torch wood starting messing with dimensional flux, cybermen were made by man, the dimensional rift of rose's dad jumping through was their own invention. The doctor saws them but experiences tragic loss to do so. Yet he keeps on saving humanity. I thought it was less deus ex machina and more a great exploration of hubris, loss, and the doctor's absolute love for humanity trumping his own happiness- like the Family of Blood episodes.

While the Europeans do tend to slaughter each other on mass every hundred years the institutions of representative government rule of law and independent press are far more entrenched than elsewhere, leading to countries that are more stable, better educated and with higher standards of living.

I'm sure one could pull up articles that are somewhat overwrought and patronising, but it would be even more absurd to write about different regions as though they were similar. To take the last paragraph:

&gt; The eventual dissolution of the United Kingdom seems inevitable. The whole county is only a few hundred years old, its borders drawn around a collection of countries and dependencies with no historical ties to one another. Many in the Ulster region are of the Irish ethnic group and declare their loyalty to the Republic of Ireland, and the historically subjugated Welsh people have made repeated attempts to declare independence. However, despite the arbitrary nature of the state and its borders, some still declare loyalty to this accident of history. Though without oil reserves, the moribund United Kingdom economy may struggle to support itself. The English leadership may not be ready to relinquish its grip on the Scottish homelands just yet.

A hundred years of continuous rule is bloody long for any country, and the success of Scottish and Welsh integration into what was in effect an extended English polity is remarkable, with the failures of Irish integration based in large part on racism and religious strife, neither of which Africa is short of. Indeed comparisons between the Scottish Independence movement and any comparable movement in Africa underline the stability of our region – no violence, no legal tomfoolery as we see in Spain in Catalonia, and no government suppression of debate. The British state has long been ahead of its time when it comes to stable reform, whatever its iniquities.

That much is clear. It should be noted that his delayed shot came after that and I felt showed his lack of confidence more than anything.

As for his failed passes, of which he only had 8 total, 6 were in the attacking third. That's not bad for a player playing as a support striker when you take out at least two of them that were played to Lennon who, rather than make a run, decided to crowd him and stand flat footed in the final third and take out those failed passes that resulted in corners for Spurs. Soldado had fewer failed passes than Adebayor both in general and in the final third and fewer failed passes than Lennon. If you are able to, look at Opta's passing maps for Lennon and look at how many passes are taken from the middle of the pitch which is absolutely inexcusable for a player who is supposed to be providing width.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"that makes more sense, unfortunately not only is SAF synonymous with long term success and stability but also with continued excellence and winning over a long term.  

I see people on other boards put the ""Spurs SAF"" title out there quite a bit and they genuinely mean it in the manner that ""manager 'X"" will be the one who leads us to record setting winning.  It gets to me because i think a great deal of people don't grasp just how impressive SAF's run was and how genuinely unlikely we are to ever see anything like it again. Putting a label like ""our SAF"" really seems like people don't have the full perspective on what that means, it puts an unfair level of expectation on whatever manager we have and disregards what SAF accomplished.

Add into the fact that with the way modern football is now becoming structured having a manager give a team beyond 5 seasons is a rarity and predicting someone for longevity is a tough call.  

The sport is changing and the money is just too much for a team to get a manager and realistically expect them to remain with the club for years on end, and if they do odds are they are exceeding the club expectations.  

Look around the league, after Wenger (who as much as i hate to say it because i hate the man, doesn't get enough credit for his success) the next longest tenured manager is i believe Pardew, and after him its Brendan Rodgers who took over Liverpool what? a month or so before AVB took our slot?....longevity is something that is going to become increasingly rare.  Moyes was long standing at Everton because he was good at keeping them in the ""upper mid-table"" area while on a budget, aside from that the managers who last long term win and win frequently.  In modern football if you aren't winning unfortunately you are effectively costing the club money, and if you cost the club money eventually you will be out of the job in favor of a new manager who holds the promise of winning.

Openreach should have been spun off BT and, as you say, run as a not for profit like network rail.

Hopefully TalkTalk and Sky will get the result they want from OFCOM in relation to the Squeeze test on how much profit ~~BT~~ Openreach are making from Fibre atm (unregulated product at present)

Also when they finally catchup with FTTC roll out (should happen this year) we should see reduced costs for getting FTTC started for customers and ISPs due to the changing technologies.

I am looking out with a keen eye at the 2013 profit reports from the Telcos, suspect BT returns will be low as tehy deal with their stupidly expensive Football purchase for their IPTV platform, hopefully get good news about Youview this year with more distributors coming to the Youview platform, afterall ABC, NBC, HBOS et all having dedicated channels on Youview and selling Subscriptions monthly to access the top US shows on launch day would be a coup, and certainly help bring in a lot of customers.

With Paulinho, Sandro and Capoue all out due to injury, we had to rely on him quite heavily once again. For some reason, people seem to forget that Capoue was out for quite awhile with a pretty scary and nasty looking injury that saw him stretchered off. With that being said, Spurs basically only had Dembele and Bentaleb to play centrally. Siggy is not a box-to-box midfielder and Holtby was looking like he was going to be moved on and then actually was loaned out. While this is all going on, and once Capoue was back from injury, rumors were coming out about his attitude problem and that Spurs were looking to move him on. I don't know how much truth there is to that, but it wouldn't surprise me given what he said to the press recently. Furthermore, Sherwood clearly isn't the type for shitty attitudes.

It's hard to believe that league games were not even televised in the UK until October 1983 (the league was worried that showing matches on TV would kill attendances).

Interesting! BT already have a ton of patents and IP related to Long Range Multi Mode fibre which is the lynchpin of their longterm strategy.

I wouldn't have said Capoue for Bentaleb because I actually think Nabil was having a good game. 

Sigurdsson, Chadli, or Kane. Take your pick. Any one of them for Soldado would have been a good substitution because having two strikers on the pitch was not doing anything for us, and adding a midfielder would have allowed us to connect the lines better and string more than 3-4 passes together. 

Today really felt like we were actually playing an old school direct 4-4-2. Neither central midfielder was really making himself available for our central defenders, so both Jan and Daws were hoofing it constantly. Walker joined in too. We are not good at this. We don't have the precision to pick out the runs and Adebayor couldn't hold the ball up very well today. 

Soldado and Adebayor were not linking up. Ade wasn't at his best and Roberto was probably about as bad as he's ever been for us. We were not getting any of the benefits of having two strikers yet we were suffering all of the drawbacks. 

I would have gone with Sigurdsson for Soldado, threw him on the left and then placed Eriksen off Adebayor. Then sit the central midfield deeper and build more patiently instead of forcing everything.

Today our team had the look of a side which was instructed to play more direct passes over the top, and I really don't think it suits us at all. Dawson only completed 60% of his passes, which is drastically lower than even his poor standards. Vertonghen was in the 70s for the same statistic.

I think a substitution was needed to change the tactics of the team, not to necessarily give us an individual spark. Two strikers does not always equate to more attacking.

seriously?

&gt;Under-occupation of large homes by older residents is one of the main problems the council has identified. The area has an older population than the rest of London, and the council believes some are in homes better suited to families, and is trying to entice them to move. Downsizing would be a win-win says Kelly. ""They can't heat it, they can't maintain it, the neighbour complains that the garden is not being looked after,"" she says.

Build homes, or retirement villages for them then?

&gt;Meanwhile, new rules intended to revive the right to buy council homes – which give tenants discounts of up to £100,000 – mean that Havering's council housing stock continues to shrink. Over the past 12 months, it has sold off 100 homes – 30 more than it has plans to build.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; That said, I don't agree either that the ECHR fails to protect us from government ""in even the slightest amount"". If it really didn't restrict governments, we wouldn't have people like Theresa May continually undermining it and suggesting that the HRA ought to be repealed.

They might pretend that it affects them, but the text of the ECHR makes it clear that it doesn't.  Nearly every directive in it has a qualification, essentially ""unless government decides to ignore this right"".  Taking as a typical example, here's bits of article 4...

&gt; No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.
&gt;
&gt;   -  For the purpose of this article the term forced or compulsory labour' shall not include:
&gt;        (d) any work or service which forms part of normal civic obligations. 

Civic obligations being defined by whom?  Government.  So this article doesn't protect me from forced labour when the government decides that's what it wants.

They're almost all like that.  Exceptions for the government.  The government being the only organisation that I need protecting from over and above what the law already grants me.

&gt; On balance, having seen how the US Constitution has effectively turned centuries-old values into facets of their national identity,

I understand what you mean.  It's simply my observation that, as antiquated as parts of it are, the US constitution does generally seem to get a lot of use when it comes to limiting their government.  Look at the NSA stuff; it's the fourth amendment that the government is being beaten up with.  What do we have that's similar?  GCHQ's identical behaviour is completely legal, we have literally nothing to use to even attempt to stop it.  For reference, here's what the ECHR does for us. Article 8:

&gt; Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
&gt; There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right _except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others_. 

They couldn't have got a broader set of exceptions... privacy protected unless the government deems that the economy would be better if they spied on you.  Privacy protected unless they think morality would be protected.  In short: no protection at all.  American citizen's can still use their, perhaps antiquated, fourth amendment to protect them.  We can use nothing.

Do I really know your team better than you do? Terry-Carvalho played more matches as a partnership in the 2004-05 season, not Terry-Gallas.

&gt; Why is that? Do you not know that he suffered a serious injury around 06 or so and then only had one really good season after that?

Lol. From 1997-2004 he was recognised as the best central defender in the world. He was great from 2005-2007 before his injuries in 2008. After a year off he came back and was brilliant in 2009-10 and 2010-11. 

You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. I don't think you get much coverage of Italian football in Canada, do you?

&gt; Again, Lucio was playing in a league that was no where near the standard of the Premier League. Also, international form isn't something that you can create a baseline with to evaluate a player. If that was the case Podolski should be considered world-class with all the goals he's scored for Germany, but he's not even close to being at that level. He bullied Drogba when at Inter - at the age of 32.

LOL. I can't use international form to back up my argument because it doesn't paint Terry in a great light. Superb argument. Again, I am sure that you don't get real coverage of German football in Canada, so you're clearly out of your depth here.

&gt; Agreed, but he is not the leader that Terry is. Also, his strengths lie in marking/tackling rather than heading the ball. Compare that to Terry and Terry is excellent at almost everything, including heading the ball. Terry was one of the few players who headed the ball clear by directing his headers to his team-mates - even when clearing his area. That's what made him better than most.

What made Terry ""better than most"" was that he was a skilled header of the ball? Give me a break. Terry was nowhere near as skilled as Carvalho with the ball and it was RC who covered for many of Terry's flaws.

On the side of the shop, I've worked in shops that were very close to being black-listed by the local police because the tapes were useless and had been overwritten so many times they had crap burnt into them, and the storage of said tapes were woefully crap. Shop owners aren't trained in the ability to care for and ensure the future validity of tape based media. Black-listing would mean the police considered the video evidence to be useless for them, ineffective in court, so not worth attempting to deal with.

On the flip side, all you need to allow permanent storage, and backup (very important and not trivial to achieve) of data is a broadband connection and the same cameras a shop would already have. The off site storage is covered by external services, and can be confirmed as valid at all times. Think - this also validates against dodgy staff turning cameras off.

Where I worked, anyone reviewing the tapes would mean turning the recording facilities off. You can record or review, not both. Digital media allows so many more options, and can ensure validity, redundancy, backups and continuous data collection.

You actually don't, because that is incorrect. In fact, Carvalho was threatening to leave due to lack of play time, at which point Jose moved Gallas to LB in 05-06 to accomodate Carvalho. Goes to show you have no idea what you're talking about.

&gt;Lol. From 1997-2004 he was recognised as the best central defender in the world. He was great from 2005-2007 before his injuries in 2008. After a year off he came back and was brilliant in 2009-10 and 2010-11.
You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. I don't think you get much coverage of Italian football in Canada, do you?

Restorting to ridiculing now, are we? 

He was only considered best between 2002 and 2004. Want to know how I know? Because those were the years he actually made it to UEFA Team of the year. He was included in the 2007 team of the year as well, but guess who was next to him in the team... John Terry.

&gt;LOL. I can't use international form to back up my argument because it doesn't paint Terry in a great light. Superb argument. Again, I am sure that you don't get real coverage of German football in Canada, so you're clearly out of your depth here.

What? John Terry's form was always excellent for England. If you're talking about off the pitch scandals, it did not affect his international form or club form. Stupid argument.

Again, Bundesliga from 2000-2010, no where near as competitive, physical or quick as Premier League, and still isn't due to the gulf in quality between the top clubs vs mid-table clubs.

Want me to hand you more stats? Nesta got into the Fifpro XI 2 times (2005,2007). Terry got in 5 CONSECUTIVE times (2005-2009).

&gt;What made Terry ""better than most"" was that he was a skilled header of the ball? Give me a break. Terry was nowhere near as skilled as Carvalho with the ball and it was RC who covered for many of Terry's flaws.
You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. I am 100% sure you were not a fan of Chelsea before Abramovich, AKA you know nothing about world football.

Second point: Mistekes like ""Sylvyian Distin"" make you seem unprofessional - proofread carefully!

Third: You don't need to mention every injured squad player, it just bogs down the analysis and risks losing your readers before they get to the substance of your analysis - mention key starter who are out but who your audience wouldn't already be aware of (e.g. Seamus Coleman was a late scratch but everyone knew Enrique wasn't going to play so mention Coleman but leave Enrique out, also no one cares about Oviedo, he's a bit-part player). Start your analysis with your prematch expectations about how you think the formations will dictate the game and use the match to confim or reject your hypothesis (this might only work as a live tactical analysis which in itself is an interesting concept)

Fourth (Here it gets harsh): By stating that you borrowed you info from EPLindex and then adding that throw-away ""go check then out they're good analysts"" it seems as if you don't know what your talking about and are just stealing their analysis without doing your own.

Fifth: Avoid cliche or cheesy phrases that don't add anything to your analysis - ""He no longer has the legs of his 24 year old self"" - just an example

Sixth: your Intro sentence is a toal throwaway, as in throw it away - nobody cares about who was expected to win in an analysis, they care about what tactical or strategic moves effected the outcome of the game (maybe that could be part of a conclusion but not an intro duction)!

Seveth: Your ""Lineups"" section make 0 sense, you spent the entire thing explaning your philosophy on how lineups aren't static (which frankly wasn't necessary) but then you ended with a picture with a sense of ""well there you have it"" - give some explainations about what implications it has for playing Gerrard where he is instead of Coutinho or Henderson, talk about what the hell Sturridge is doing wide left something of that nature.

8th: If you are going to adress injuries, again, don't talk about the ones that happen during the game! That should be a part of the match breakdown, discuss how things changed when the injury occur but in the context of the match.

Overall you have a decent foundation to build from but your open paragraphs need a lot of work to become more relevant and interesting or you will lose readers to boredom/disinterest (I still think a quick breakdown of your own prematch and early match predictions would be helpful).

It's not a perfect rule since these can be part of a balanced lunch, but the school also has to consider ease of enforcement against the restrictions. The harm from not having mini-cheddars is hardly significant.

It is very easy to win 6 out of 8 games, heck even Newcastle did that this season, but to expect a team a win 6 of 8 for the whole season and finish with 85 point because they did that for two months isn't realistic. In the same way it is much easier for a team to be on pace for 100 points for bnrief stretches of a season without actualy coming close to that total (ex. City are on pace for 114 points over their last 8 games).

What interests me more is what point totals need to be reached to qualify for 4th. If we use Liverpool as the standard then 76 is the magic number (2 points per game). Then the graph goes as follows:

Liverpool - 30 pts /45 available (Liverpool can drop 15 points and still qulaify for 4th)

Everton - 31 pts /42 available (can drop only 11)

Spurs - 32 pts /42 available (can drop 10)

Man U - 36 pts / 42 avalable (can drop 6)

What this means is that Man U need a nearly perfect run to even have a shot at fourth and Everton and Spurs can drop points in a maximum of 4 or 5 of 14 matches to finish the season to have a shot a CL

I really think we should be looking up the table not down at this point, Liverpool have gone through their rough patch and will now jump up a bit in performance. I'm personally intrigued to see if Chelsea's strikerless team can continue to consistently win games and if Arsenal will fade. They have a stretch where the play @Spurs, @Chelsea, v. City, @Everton, v. West Ham, @Hull, v. Newcastle, plus they have to host United as well as come to Anfield!!

Well yes, we basically need more houses. We need social housing for people who are never going to afford to buy a place. We need private housing for people who aren't eligible for social housing, so they stand a chance of buying a place of their own.

I suppose my point is that, given a shortage of homes in both sectors, transferring housing from social to private is neutral in the overall scheme of things. It is bad news if you are on the council waiting list, good news if you are looking to buy. If you regard those two groups as equally deserving, it balances out.

The real problem is that council housing is being sold at below market rates, so every sale syphons money out of the social housing pot and into some individual's pocket.

I'm afraid I'm not reading it that way.  It's pretty clear that it's been written with national law as being the relevant thing, not European law.  It might be that ECHR decides if an abuse has taken place, but clearly, the abusing government can just point to the part that says ""except such as is in accordance with the law"" and then point to whatever law they have chosen to make up.

&gt; Just to be clear though: are you saying that you do or don't want us to have a codified constitution?

I would love us to have one -- but not just any old one.  I'm using the ECHR as evidence as to what would happen if we got modern politicians to write one though -- that it wouldn't be the protection that those who wish simply for ""a codified constitution"" would want.  It would be no protection at all, in fact.

1. Go on Wikipedia or ask a Chelsea forum who the main CB-partnership was in the 2004-05 season. You'll be shocked to see the main response given.

2. Don't use fan-voted and player-voted awards to judge who the best defenders are. If anything it makes you look ignorant because you can't argue the cases yourself. You're probably the type of person who thinks Dani Alves is the best right back in the world because he is in that FIFPRO XI. Or that Sergio Ramos is the best central defender as well.

3. Unless it is a major difference in quality (i.e. Premier League and Russian League) using ""x"" league is better than ""y"" league is a flawed argument. Lúcio proved his worth at three different clubs in two different leagues, something Terry has never done because he was always in his comfort zone.

4. Using stats to claim a defender is better than the other is laughable and just shows how Americanised you have personally turned football into. Or should I say *soccer*.

true,Greaseball01,pertwee,Pertwee,"I feel like Blink is kind of a microcosm for the brilliant elements of Moffats writing. First of all he gives us this character, that for all intents and purposes is pretty unremarkable beyond being determined and clever and over the course of a single episode makes her a compelling protagonist and makes us actively route for her despite her never reappearing in the series. It's incredibly unique in that respect in that the story is about The Doctor and a plan that he is essentially entirely responsible for putting into action and we get to see it play out from the perspectives of the people who carry out the plan for him. And even thought the Doctor's not the main character in the episode, the story manages to revolve around him despite him not being present in it. First point there.

The second, and the real aspect that I meant when I said this was a microcosm for the awesomeness in the way Moffat writes who is that it's an incredibly well done and clever time travel story. We all know that quote from when they finally have the conversation through the DVD, ""wibbly-wobbly, timey-whimey...stuff"" and this is my overall point. Before Moffat came along, Doctor Who had never really touched on time travel, it had never been a major point in the plot of the stories, the tardis was simply a plot device to give the writers unlimited freedom in deciding the setting of their episodes, they never tried to do mind bending, timey-whimey storylines, the only one I can think of is when Davros uses the doctors knowledge of the dalek's future to alter them so that they can't be defeated, thus altering the future, and even that got fixed by the doctor before it actually altered history. Oh and Attack of the Cybermen now I think about it, but again, the cybermen just have a plan to change history but don't actually. Oh and Earthshock, that's probably the best example since that's a really cool time travel idea that sort of comes out of nowhere. But anyway getting off the point, which is that Moffat approached time travel in his episodes in a way that writers had rarely done in Doctor Who's past. It became an integral part of the story, the implications of it and the effects of it on the characters was fully explored, and it was all used in a clever way that both made sense and didn't at the same time, the way time travel should be presented because it is an inherent paradox in most cases; wibbly-wobbly, timey-whimey. I would say that Blink is the best example of this in Moffat's work, since it does non-linearity in time, mixed with cyclical time theories mixed with altering the past, it simply explores every possible aspect of it while his other episodes tend to focus on just one.

But above all that, one of, if not the, best things about Blink are that it is an episode that you can watch stand alone, with absolutely no prior knowledge of Doctor Who and when you are done with it you will know exactly whether the show is for you or not. It captures the tone, style, character and ambiance of the show all in one short burst of time whilst at the same time managing to be unique in it's style of monster, it's style of telling the story and the kind of story that it's telling. Of all the episodes by Moffat that you could attack, this one probably makes the least sense simply because it is one of the highlights of the entire show and one of, if not the, highlight in Moffats writing on the show, and I think for as long as new people are discovering this show, Blink will be the gateway that I recommend they enter through.

Cranking up the price of art to absurd amounts essentially nullifies all criticism of it and that's what turns people off art altogether. The quality of the art your viewing is not left to your discretion, only to the people who buy it, who want to hype it up in order to make it worth even more money, or to give themselves 'immortality' (like Mugrabi) on museum plaques.

The big problem is perhaps not the prices on their own, but who the prices make art accessible to. In The Mona Lisa Curse they interview the director of New York's Met Museum, and he says that buying new permanent pieces is being increasingly difficult when in competition against super rich private collectors.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; Define tribe for me?

a social division in a traditional society consisting of families or communities linked by social, economic, religious, or blood ties, with a common culture and dialect, typically having a recognized leader.

&gt; Seeing as, for example, the Northern region of Nigeria is divided into states, not tribal hunting and grazing lands as Westerners like to believe and is often reported in the British press, can you see how your own ignorance and biases are informing your view on this? The same sort of condescending myopia that this piece is satirizing.

&gt; Which begs the question why does it have to be pithy?

I literally have no opinions on the specifics of Nigeria. Of the roughly 200 states in the world today I have strong views on maybe 10 of them, some knowledge of maybe another 20 and then mostly ignorance on the remainder, aside from some vague sketches on given regions. This is the norm for anyone not engaged in ethnographic studies or some similar field.

Journalism is not supposed to make you incredibly well informed. By its nature it summarises things. In the past this was due to the costs of printing, but now it is more defined by competition for your attention. If one was to define the Israeli-Palestine conflict as tribal you would be fundamentally correct, despite glossing over the imperial, religious and historical minutiae. And people tend to be more interested in the specifics of their own affairs than those of others. Go figure.

I've no doubt some journalism on less developed countries is patronising. But given the context of where it is published, is the impression roughly correct? Are these conflicts more ancestral and primitive than those in Europe? I'm guessing they probably are.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I'm afraid I'm not reading it that way. It's pretty clear that it's been written with national law as being the relevant thing, not European law. It might be that ECHR decides if an abuse has taken place, but clearly, the abusing government can just point to the part that says ""except such as is in accordance with the law"" and then point to whatever law they have chosen to make up.  

With respect, it's not a matter of how you read it. It is simply a fact that the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) is responsible for interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and ruling on whether a Convention right has been violated. That is the fundamental purpose that it was set up for. Individual signatories have decided their own relationships with the ECHR and ECtHR, but again, that is not a problem with the wording of Convention rights themselves but with the Convention's lack of sovereignty or entrenchment.  

To put it another way: if a signatory State fully applies the ECHR, it implicitly applies the jurisprudence of the ECtHR which is mandated by the ECHR itself to interpret Convention rights, and it does not decide for itself which acts do and don't fall under the derogations provided. If it decides for itself, it is not fully applying the ECHR.

I think a good job was done of bringing in players to provide depth. However, the initiative to add players to make-up for the loss of Bale or to add players who would replace players we already in the first eleven wasn't as superb as people made it out to be at the time and hasn't really worked out so far. Players like Capoue, Chiriches, Chadli, and arguably Paulinho, depending on how you rate him compared to Dembele, provide great depth and increase the overall quality of the squad but they don't really improve the first eleven. 

As for players that were brought into improve the first eleven and/or help make-up for the loss of Bale; Soldado, Eriksen, Lamela, and arguably Paulinho, they have all been fairly disappointing so far bar Eriksen. This has resulted in the team not really being improved and more than likely not being as good as last years team due to the loss of Bale.

&gt; His partnership with Terry included a run of 16 games without conceding a goal. He also played as a right-back at times.

Here's a snipet from article from The Guardian:

&gt;Tellingly, from the blue corner came chants neither for the goalscorer, nor catalyst Alexei Smertin, but 'John Terry, William Gallas!' Tottenham manager Martin Jol had to admire it. 'That's the key to their success,' he said. 'They play 4-3-3 with two solid blocks of four and Claude Makelele is a real defensive midfielder. They don't want to give anything away.'

- Here's another link where CFC fans discuss Gallas or Carvalho: http://www.bigsoccer.com/community/threads/gallas-or-carvahlo-discuss.340118/

- Another: http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showpost.php?p=67750917&amp;postcount=563

Carvalho was PART of our first year defence but everyone knew the Terry-Gallas partnership was the best. Also, Gallas made 28 appearances in 04-05, and Carvalho made 25. In 05-06, Carvalho: 24, Gallas: 34. Go look it up and put a sock in it.

&gt; Don't use fan-voted and player-voted awards to judge who the best defenders are. If anything it makes you look ignorant because you can't argue the cases yourself. You're probably the type of person who thinks Dani Alves is the best right back in the world because he is in that FIFPRO XI. Or that Sergio Ramos is the best central defender as well.

Lol. Ignorant because I include their personal awards. Brilliant! Dani Alves was actually LETHAL when he was at Sevilla, and at one point even we were linked with a £25m bid for him. Yes, £25m for a full-back. He may get defensively exposed a lot these days, but from from 2009-2011 he WAS the best RB in the world. I cannot imagine who else you would name was better in his position. Ramos wasn't the best CB in the world, no, because he rarely ever played as a CB, and was mostly a RB back then who got sent off a lot. Last couple of years he has been one of the best in the world, and even someone like Man UTD would take him with open arms in today's date if it were possible.

&gt; Unless it is a major difference in quality (i.e. Premier League and Russian League) using ""x"" league is better than ""y"" league is a flawed argument. Lúcio proved his worth at three different clubs in two different leagues, something Terry has never done because he was always in his comfort zone.

So according to you Maldini cannot be considered as one of the best ever CB's in the world because he only played for Milan? What a farcical argument.

And there WAS a major difference in quality between EPL and Budesliga. You are simply stating points without backing them up.


&gt;I never said that Carvalho was better at heading the ball. I said that Carvalho was more skilled than Terry was, and it is the truth. Terry was blood and thunder, Carvalho was class and elegance.

Lol, no shit Carvalho was more skilled than JT, doesn't make him a better CB than him though. Just like Luiz is more skilled than almost every CB in the world, but that doesn't make him the best CB in the world. Your arguments are so facile.

Really, Rose and Eleventh Hour are the same idea for a story, it's attempting to introduce the audience to two characters at once by showing their first meeting and how that meeting (or meetings) alters them as people in massive ways and inspires them to run away together.

Now with this in mind, the main issue with Rose can be seen in it's title, it's almost all about this one character when it should be about the entire concept as a whole. Instead of letting Rose (and by extension us) meet the doctor in person and judge him as a person, we see him for a little while at the beginning and then get serenaded with legends of his exploits that don't really seem to fit with this strange, clever, slightly rude guy with a huge grin and an obviously dark past. The way they do it is intriguing certainly and I guess kind of acts as more a set up for them slowly telling us about the Doctor's past, rather than trying to jam it all into the one episode, but I think the great thing about Eleventh Hour is that it manages to tell us who the doctor is, who this other character we're being introduced to (Amy/Amelia) is, and generally give us a set up of what the entire show is going to be from that point on wards as well as very discreetly revealing plot elements that are going to be revisited over the course of the next three seasons whilst still making them important to the plot.

Now in Rose, they try to do all that great stuff from eleventh hour, but just in a sloppier way, which part of me thinks maybe was due to the fact that they didn't have as much time as in eleventh hour, but then I think back to all the stuff that they could have replaced or shortened (The dumb stuff with the Mickey dummy, mainly). What we ultimately end up with is an opener that doesn't really give us a clear picture at all of what's to come, we understand where Rose is coming from, but we can't really know from just that episode what the show is going to be like or the direction it's going to be taking either in tone or story. 

Meanwhile Eleventh Hour does all those things I just said but correctly. It even manages to introduce a unique setting and give it an incredibly distinct character whilst introducing an entirely new main cast, a largely different style of production, and a pretty different direction to the idea.

So yeah, to be honest I'd like to go into more depth but I haven't watched Rose in quite a while. Maybe some time I'll rewatch them both back to back and do some kind of comparison of sorts.

Take a look through the categories. Honestly it is probably stupidly expensive to insure an art collection but as a museum or corporation I imagine it is slightly easier.

*Museums can take advantage of AXA ART’s bespoke underwriting and a specially-tailored policy for the insurance of exhibits within a museum or when on loan.*

http://www.axa-art.co.uk/fileadmin/Cluster/UK/PRODUKTE/New_wordings/Museum_Exhibits_Only_9.pdf

Obviously I don't endorse AXA. It is just an example of many insurance companies policies on insuring museums, art and other private collections. 

If you have a private, individual insurance policy I imagine it would cover situations such as this. It would require certain guarantees on protection by the institution for the insurance company to be satisfied. A certain level of protection for the art would be required such as security guards, cameras, ID, visitor registration, etc. If a genuine lapse occurred as seems to be the case with the child then that is ok but you don't want a claim like this happening every month.

Edited for mor historical accuracy: *using as an example the common misconceptions surrounding The Scots, as popilarized by Sir Walter Scott, the Scots could be said to have* many different traditional clans, with family ties, proud ancestry, ancestoral homes and family crests and colours (tartans). It's another name for effectively a similar thing. Some scotts care deeply about it. Some not so much. Scots could not be described as one tribe as a whole, they do however make up the the people of a country. (I want to say nation but the whole uk thing confuses this issue so I'm erring on the side of caution).


I think we must have misunderstood each other (or as your name suggests, you are trolling). I wasn't suggesting that whole nations were one tribe or whole ethnic groups. I was also talking about people as tribes, not tribal lands. I was talking about the links being between people and whilst they may have had ties to certain areas of land, taking or breaking that tie to the land does not necessarily break the ties between people. I was trying to make a distinction between the division of land and division of peoples and their personal, familial or historical connections with other people.

'If Norwich keep playing like that, then they have nothing to worry about'

This is a point that needs reminding to us. At the end of today's game, I was there, doubting Hughton, fearing the worst. Take a step back, look at the stats.

We battered Cardiff. What we need is goals. We get chances, we get possession, we have creativity (Snoddy was excellent today, alot will disagree but he created so much).

I truly believe if Ricky gets one soon, he will start up and keep getting more. Just look back to his first goal for us, he was obviously ecstatic to get it, and played much more positively after it.

Our tactics were spot on today, Hughton made the right subs at the right time (gasp) and we were foiled by a resilient Cardiff and an unbelievable performance from Marshall in their goal.

We need to keep positivity, we need to get behind the team. We all know how hard this next home game is going to be, and the players will still be hurting from the last time we faced Man City.

The home crowd is the advantage. We get behind them, we get them going and we could change our luck and more importantly, change the way our season is going.

I hope for a draw against Man City at best, but we have beaten them before.

Keep behind the team if you're at the game next week, sing to keep our team in the premier league. If anyone knows how important a twelfth man is, it is fucking Norwich City!

I think our biggest struggle this season has been getting the ball from our defensive lines to our attacking lines, and so a good passer playing deep is needed I think.  There still needs to be good passing options made in front of him with movement on the wings and in the CAM spot, which we haven't been very good at providing so far.

Neither Sandro or Capoue are amazing forward passers... I thought Holtby could potentially be a deep-lying playmaker but not sure 100% that he currently has the quality for that role.  I guess Sherwood thinks Bentaleb could do it.  Dembele could do it as long as he's paired with a proper CDM, as his greatest asset is being able to slalom through players with the ball at his feet, so he needs to be able to get forward with someone safely behind him.

It's really hard at the moment... I don't know that there's a clear-cut best midfield for us at the moment.  At times this season, Dembele, Bentaleb, Paulinho, Sandro and Capoue have all looked great, and all looked crap.  I'd say only Dembele picks himself.  Paulinho looked great in that one game before his injury, but I haven't been 100% convinced of him otherwise.

http://www.transfermarkt.com/en/william-gallas/leistungsdaten/spieler_3156_2004.html

Gallas played 12 matches as a CB in the 2004-05 season. Those matches came in August 2004, October 2004 (for 45 minutes), and December 2004-February 2004. Those matches came when:

Apart from the match in August, each match Gallas played at CB came when Carvalho was out injured. FACT. Carvalho was injured from December 2004 to February 2005 with an ankle/foot injury. Source is the ever reliable [Physioroom](http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/players/1772/ricardo_carvalho_injury.html?affid=77)

Gallas played 9 matches as a RB in 2004-05, and 7 matches as a LB in 2004-05.

Every match Carvalho played was as a CB. FACT.

That's not correct. If the new series contradicts the old, the new is wrong.

This is not like such a situation in the comics.

true,Greaseball01,pertwee,Pertwee,"Well aren't you being nitpicky? Alrighty, I guess we'll go down the list.

1) It wasn't a clockwork space ship, it was a regular space ship with clockwork robots on board, presumably for maintenance purposes and other menial tasks, as is usually the use for robots and androids in a sci-fi and real life setting. Why they were clock doesn't really have a reason and I would say doesn't really need one because it's a perfectly legitimate design choice chosen in this case merely for it's aesthetics being both beautiful and creepy. I don't know why you think it doesn't make sense, if clockwork was an ineffective method of locomotion we wouldn't have clocks.

2) Again, not a clockwork spaceship, but I see your point. I believe with the right additions you could make organs function as their mechanic counterparts in a more complex combination of machines, the heart is a simple pump, it has valves and in many respects is a more advanced version of what we create to mimic it, like have you ever seen the ridiculous machinery they have to run through a person to take the place of a heart? It's like the size of a small room. If you knew how to get the optimal output from the organ you were putting in the ships circuitry then it would be a theoretically very effective means of fixing your ship up. It's the same concept as the matrix essentially, just a little more gruesome. And if you want a similar process being done in real life, look at pacemakers, by your logic they shouldn't work because it's technology mixing with machines which can't work. But the fact is it can, because organs are just parts of a machine that grow instead of being built.

3) Again, you appear to have misunderstood how these machines think. Because they don't understand the concept of a name, they get to thinking that the ship is named after her because it is her. Because they are machines they're concept of a name is that it refers to this specific entity. The ship has her name, therefore it must need her to control it, therefore they need to get to her and place her in a position to control it, once they do that, then they will know what to do. Because let's remember, these robots are essentially brainless, they can make logical deductions like the one shown above but that does not mean that they can create a plan on what to do next, because their crew is all dead their job is still only to mend the ship, and because there is no crew to correct them they think that the only way to completely mend the ship is to get this poor womans brain, then she can tell them what to do. Really it plays into the whole idea of them being clockwork, they're a brilliant work of machinery that functions in astonishingly complex ways but ultimately can't function without constant supervision, and as such is useless without someone to wield it.

And the horse wasn't appropriated for parts because, as the robots say, they only needed one last part; the mainframe e.i. the brain of a certain French aristocrat.

We had a clean sheet at home vs UTD (Carling cup + league), clean sheet vs Spurs away, only 1 goals conceded in a game that we WON vs Man UTD away at Old Trafford - all games which had Gallas - Terry partnership. 
Want another fun fact? Jose took off Carvalho away at Arsenal after 45 minutes and kept Gallas and Terry on the field in a game that we were 'losing' with Terry-Carvalho in the middle.

Also, that website transfermarkt is WRONG on a lot of accounts. Gallas played CB vs middlesbrough at home, play at CB vs Liverpool away (check soccernet).... I don't know how many other stats are wrong on that website.

&gt;You link me to forums where these posts are made in April 2006 and August 2013 like that helps supplement your argument.

I did that on purpose. The fact that people in 2013 are talking about the Terry-Gallas partnership (and not Terry-Carvalho) should tell you how valued that partnership was.

And lol at all your other 'points'.. Calling them pathetic because you know you're wrong.

Oh? I don't know managers from pre-Abramovich era? You sound like a pissed off Liverpool fan. I bet you've never even heard of Vialli or Gullit. Yes, the Ruud Gullit who brought ""beautiful football"" to England before you knew what it was.

I went to Bradford through clearing too due to poor grades. All I would say is if you want the proper uni experience don't go to bradford. Fair play they have spent a lot making the campus attractive but the teaching quality and opportunities afterwards were severely limited. A lot of employers asking me why I went to Bradford not out of curiosity but out of concern. I wanted to go to Leeds too and I wish I had.

 The people that Bradford uni attracts are just odd, people the got 3 D's and no social skills. What I also learned is that foreign students take an entrance exam and depending how good their English is depends on which band of uni they are offered. So they say ""your English isn't great so we can't offer your Cambridge, Oxford or any of the top 20, but how about Bradford?""

What you find is you end up spending a lot of time on trains to Leeds to go shopping/nights out/any form of culture.

It does have the stigma of having racial tension where it is a case of a lot of angry locals and Asians that don't socially integrate. There is a lot of poverty and homelessness in the city and whilst it has improved in the city centre with the likes of new shops/bars/city park it is still very cold and bleak.
Like I said I think you should go and visit Bradford, walk around and get a feel for the city. Think would I like living here for 3 years?

If the answer is yes make sure you get actively involved with all the cool shit they offer on campus as there's shit else to do apart from depressing nights in flares and getting trains to the toweringly better city Leeds

Loving Vincent is a Kickstarter campaign that only has 4 days left to raise enough money to create the world's first feature-length painted animation based on Vincent's art, friends, and and life.


About the movie...

""Loving Vincent is an investigation delving into the life and controversial death of Vincent Van Gogh, one of the world's most beloved painters, told by his paintings and by the characters that inhabit them. The intrigue unfolds through interviews with the characters closest to Vincent and through dramatic reconstructions of the events leading up to his death.

Loving Vincent features over one hundred and twenty of Vincent Van Gogh's greatest paintings. The plot, drawn from the 800 letters written by the painter himself, lead us to the significant people and events in the time leading up to his unexpected death.

Loving Vincent will be the world's first feature-length painted animation, and is brought to you by Oscar winning film companies Breakthru Films and Trademark Films. Every frame in the Loving Vincent movie is an oil painting on canvas, using the very same technique in which Vincent himself painted.



Loving Vincent will be produced through 2013 and 2014...
... to be completed in 2015 - the 125th anniversary of van Gogh's death.""

It goes without saying that you should watch the Kickstarter trailer, back the making of this production, and spread the word.

If you find that you can only rent the house out for say £5000 per month, that might correspond to a market value of £2M. If you don't rent it out, the buyer has to use a different way to estimate a reasonable price, probably based on the purchase price and some measure of inflation - and that might come out to £10M.

I think your last paragraph nails it however.  The thing about the likes of Everton and Liverpool is that they have a cohesive style of play.  Their respective managers have worked hard with the team to develop a distinct sense of purpose on the pitch that we just don't have.  AVB spent half of our season trying to drill something into us that just wasn't working, and now Sherwood doesn't seem to have a particularly distinctive philosophy, other than downplaying the role of tactics and the manager.

We need to work hard on the training ground at one touch pass and move, and engineer a tactical set up that utilises the strengths of our players.

Yeah I got carried away, I meant to write defender not CB. Even then he went to the CL Final playing CB. My point still stands. He is still considered as one of the best defenders in the world, correct? He played for just one club, correct? Your quip about a player being in his comfort zone because he stays in one club for his entire career is rubbish. Hell.. Your idol Baresi stayed at Milan for his entire career too.

What else does ""skill"" mean? Luiz is good on the ball. He has skill. What else does it mean? Carvalho and Terry were equally good at tackling, Carvalho was better at marking, Terry was better at Heading. Carvalho was better with the ball at his feet, but Terry has developed both his feet.

&gt;You make so many moronic comments that I fail to see how you are knowledgeable about football outside of what you read on Wikipedia and on other vices.

You've done exactly the same. Nothing you've said has come from anything other than what's reported in the news... Because everything you can ever claim to have knowledge of is reported in the news. 

&gt;You can't argue your own claims so you look at their Wikipedia pages to find individual awards that defenders have won. Because defenders are judged on individual awards.

Yes, as opposed to YOUR WORD. You have failed to provide anything else but your opinion in this entire conversation and then you go on to provide some sleazy website to tell me how many times Gallas played at CB. What a joke.

&gt;Nesta ""only has 1 good year after his injury in 2006"". LOL. I know you don't get Serie A coverage in Canada, so how on earth would you know about that? Wikipedia?
Hahahahahaha. Keep living in your small little bubble. There's a reason why Franco Baresi himself said that Nesta was his heir.

The fact that you're resorting to ridiculing goes to show how less you believe in your own argument, but I'll still indulge because what the hell.

Of course Baresi would say that, they're both Italian. Would you ever see an Englishman saying there are better defenders outside the EPL? Hell, this article with Carragher itself goes to prove my point. Also, just because Baresi was the most talented player of his generation does not mean he has the potential to spot talent. Also, Baresi said THIAGO SILVA is his heir, not Nesta. Nice way to conjure up bs. All he said about Nesta was that he liked the move Milan made.

&gt; And Terry? Just your typical great English central defender who was abysmal with the ball but a great header.

You're absolutely right that the north of England has also reaped little benefit from the UK's structures (and I've had many constructive conversations with devolutionists in Yorkshire about these issues), and its population may eventually conclude, like many in Scotland have, that the socio-political divide between them and the rest of the UK is one that can't be resolved as a single state, or as a unitary state. In the meantime, I see little reason why we shouldn't exercise [*our* established right, as a nation, to self-determination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination)—one which is not extended to an English city whose people identify as English—as a permanent solution to our own problems. Hell, [it might even do those in the north some favours](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/10/independent-scotland-northern-england) ([campaigners for devolution certainly think so](http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0192/independence-boost-for-english-devolutionists)).

You're effectively acknowledging the issues affecting Scotland, but whereas the campaign for independence (an inclusive movement spearheaded by three parties, not just the SNP) proposes a pragmatic solution whereby Scotland and the rest of the UK work together as sovereign states only on matters on which they agree, you suggest: ""just suck it up"". Why? You can't expect us to stick with the status quo for the sake of it!

Despite your weird suggestion that those against independence would be disenfranchised in an independent Scotland, institutions like the Scottish Parliament are far more democratic than their UK counterparts—we have a more proportional allocation of seats and no unelected upper house. The transfer of power from the House of Commons and House of Lords to the Scottish Parliament represents a massive democratic empowerment of everyone in Scotland, unionists included.

You can break down almost any society like that. The famous ""workinclassproddy"" Tribe of Glasgow, and the dreaded ""headhuntingcockney"" Tribe of London. If you're going to argue that they're tribes and we're not because of the word ""traditional"", then you seriously need to look at the situation. In fact, hey've had more drastic changes recently than we have, sooo... we're more traditional?

&gt; Are these conflicts more ancestral and primitive than those in Europe? I'm guessing they probably are.

Are they? More violent (if that's what you mean by primitive, I hope you're not referring to the people), certainly, but they're unstable countries. Less stable than when the European powers showed up, I'd guess - but I'm not going to try and bring this around to blaming the UK or anyone else for their situation, it's not relevant. Ancestral?

I agree on the teamwork thing.  I think we definitely have a squad that is better than Everton's, and close to Liverpool.  What we lack is a world class difference maker, which they have in Suarez.  He's the man who single-handedly wins them games like Bale did for us last season.

But even without him, you're right that they play as a team much better than us.

And since you brought it up, can we talk about how fucking weird and kind of messed up the whole Ursula getting rescued as a face in a slab of concrete thing was? I mean it was just kind of horrifying to begin with, but then they make their comment about their sex life and you realise, RTD is literally trying to implant the image in my mind of the protagonist of the story that I've been watching for the last 43ish minutes, skull fucking a slab of concrete with a face on it. I mean where would her mouth even lead? I don't want to be thinking about these things but he's made it impossible for me not to. And, to get serious here real quick, wouldn't the existence of being a completely immobile entity that can't be seen in public without becoming some sort of terrible science project be such a hopelessly awful one that eventually she'd just long for death? And I bet that's impossible for her now without being thrown into a volcano or something. I mean, right, there's got to be some planet in some time that the doctor is aware of where they have medical facilities that could get an at least slightly better result out of the face saved in concrete thing, surely right? Wouldn't that solve everything and be entirely possible in the framework of the show? And that would of been significantly better. They could of taken her to the hospital from New Earth just as a cool little reference to something earlier in the episode, although in this case that would annoy me too because New Earth was a stinking pile of horse manure. Anyway, slight tangent there, my point is, the Ursula concrete head thing was weird and a bad ending.

You can maintain a character and have them be recognisable as the character they started out as but, the point of what we're watching is to see him be changed by the events, because, as I've said these are events that would probably have pretty significant effects on a person's psyche and emotional state. To be honest I'm probably not giving the way that's expressed in the acting enough credit because the guy that plays Elton is fantastic actor. He was in a series you might have seen called Mad Dogs, it had John Simm in it and the other guy from Life on Mars, I only watched the first two seasons but it was good, really weird, but good. But yeah my point is the acting is definitely not much of a problem. It's sort of comical in an incredibly depressing way when they're all talking to each other when they're faces on the aliens body. I mean that whole thing was so fucked up too. You know that fucking monster was dreamed up by an eight year old? I feel bad for that eight year old because he must have some fucking nasty nightmares. But, some adult must have looked at for a minute and realised that it was just irredeemably fucked up. I'm betting RTD chose it because he thought it was a great idea and unique and all that, but then he sat down to write the story about it and realised just how horrific it truly was, so he figured the only way to make it watchable was to throw some humor in, cast Peter Kay as the monster, he's funny, he'll make it seem less fucked up, which didn't work. Anyway, I don't know how I got onto this topic, so, yeah.

Oh, she was nine years old, just read that bit, I'd go back and edit but then we'd be here for months, but yeah, blue peter, used to be the shit.

But that's my point dude, it's not cartoonish, it's horrific, I've gone into this already, what I wrote before finishing reading was strangely prophetic.

Anyway, sorry that was so long, I got a bit carried away, anyway, how are you? What's going on? How are you feeling? Good? Have you considered watching season 6 back a second time? Because I fucking hated it the first time around but it improved vastly on the second viewing. Anyway, hope this message finds you well, good luck with all your future endeavors are successful and merry Christmas.

See, unlike you, I bring facts to the table. I do not need to ""conjure up bs"" because I have watched football before Abramovich came to Chelsea, and I am knowledgeable about world football. Anyone who has an ounce of knowledge regarding Alessandro Nesta knows what Baresi had to say about him. 

[Baresi promuove Nesta: «E' più forte di me»](http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2002/settembre/04/Baresi_promuove_Nesta_piu_forte_co_0_0209046435.shtml)

Seeing as how you don't know Italian, run that through a translator. You're so contradictory, do you know how stupid you sound?

&gt; Of course Baresi would say that, they're both Italian.
&gt; Also, Baresi said THIAGO SILVA is his heir, not Nesta. Nice way to conjure up bs.

Are you having difficulty keeping up with this debate? Baresi *clearly* spotted talent in Nesta. He's always been conservative with his comments -- when the next ""golden generation"" of Italian central defenders were coming through, he made sure to note that each of them needed to grow as a player. Funnily enough he did not say anything like that about Nesta in 97 and he was vindicated by 2002 when he said Nesta was better than him.

It's crazy how you argue which player is better than the other by Team of the Year nominations. It just shows how ignorant you are. Have you ever seen Patrik Andersson and Cosmin Contra play? I am very sure you haven't.

Keep on manipulating my statements. Terry excelled at Chelsea when he was playing in a deeper line. When AVB insisted on the high-line Terry struggled...no surprises. Baresi played in two completely different systems and excelled at both of them, with the offside trap under Sacchi and the deeper line under Capello. 

Maldini under the same circumstances, except under Ancelotti he played in a completely new system as well.

Again, if you knew *anything* about Italian football you would know something about Milan of the late 80s and 90s. But evidently you don't.",0,1391307821,null,0,false,0,cf4t8tk,t3_1wonoo,t1_cf4t8tk,t1_cf4rucn,null,1432212536,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Much as I'd like to get into a pissing contest about who's got the most jargon on their cv 

You asked for details, now you're complaining about the details. And you call that jargon? Wow, you sound like my parents. I thought you used to do it for a living or something.

&gt;I asked because you are spreading misinformation about how MS became dominant on the pc

And are noticeably not giving similar details (or any details at all). If you don't like the problem of Windows providing WYSIWYG and a common screen/ printer driver being a popular thing, then sorry - it's not my fault that nobody bought OS/2. And I'm not spreading, you're digging; it's all verifiable.

&gt; spouting the same rhetoric that was stated in court during their antitrust case

Rhetoric would suggest I had some intention of pushing MS stuff regardless - which is what you appear to think (or want to think) is my point, whereas I've been relating the history of Office as a suite (and up to a point, Windows as an OS). I work on whatever is in front of me, be it *nix or MS. In a perfect world, we'd all still be on Amigas, but I'm dealing with what businesses have generally plumped for.

&gt;The court found it was bullshit and ruled against them

Because you can't use your own popularity as an excuse for monopolistic activities - your point is? (not being allowed as a defence doesn't mean it's not true, more that it doesn't justify abusing your position).

&gt;They appealed their break up but they were still found guilty of monopolistic activities

But weren't broken up - and they're not exactly on their own at this size of the game; unless you think the like of Apple haven't behaved in the same way at all.

&gt;That's why I found your answer ridiculous, and you with it.

It's obvious you're reading what you want into it, but go ahead if it makes you feel better. Maybe list some details of your experience and how it outweighs others of any size or length of time.

&gt;Funny how you dismiss volunteers in IT

Feel free to give examples of your experience at the scales I'm used to. And I don't usually dismiss volunteers - I teach them. Unless, of course, they act like they're 15 :-)

&gt;the whole industry relies on such feedback and support forums for twats like you to google error codes. 

Because in no way do I contribute to any of those at all...oh, sorry, you think all those contributions are from volunteers? *righto*. I'm not sure at what level a volunteer would be able to play with a live SCCM setup handling 10,000 users in order to see the kinds of issues one would see to report on, but I'm sure it must happen. Somehow. Somewhere. Now that I've spoken to a real expert such as yourself :-)

&gt;See that kind of combative/accusatory/selective quoting argument style of yours might work irl 

It works everywhere. If you're dictatorial, you get combative replies. If you're ignorant but opinionated, you get accusatory replies. (Let's skip selective since you've gone from asserting I know nothing to complaining that volunteers are as good as contractors and calling site details 'jargon' instead of providing your own). If you just talk half-remember bullshit, you get to entertain me.

&gt;but online it doesn't because what each of us said is printed out for us to see

Yes, we can easily see how you've already covered no-true-Scotsman.

&gt;One minute it's all about not wasting taxpayers money, the next it doesn't matter if it goes out the country.

Which (again) were answers to separate questions of yours - one about licensing and value-for-money (MS being better), the next about developers contributing via local tax (which they don't if most of them are abroad). You're right, it's good that this is all printed so people can see when someone gets desperate and starts mixing answers in order to attack. Sorry, you were saying?

&gt;I look at other comments itt and they're full of comments about how it's a ploy to get cheaper licenses, how moving from Excel is not practical for some types of work, how open office/libre office is a bit shite, how they've heard it all before. All of which are reasonable comments.

Indeed, I've been one of the people saying that, because we found the same thing. Lots of people have. 

&gt;You're saying that open source can't be used full stop. 

Not for an office suite, or really as a desktop OS unless you're working as a thin-client accessing Citrix or similar. Unless, of course, you're a bedroom-warrior and 'all your friends use it'. Or manage very, very small sites.

&gt;And the story isn't even about linux vs MS, it was about using open formats.

...hence the mention of switching to other software in the title and the article, which is why the thread has been about MS Office, other suites, MS and how the Windows/ Office licenses are a small fraction of the cost...and for a second time, you mix replies instead of addressing my points...which all amounts to a lot of fandango-ing and butthurt when I've just been listing my experience, how it's not uncommon and why it means nobody is going to simply dump MS Office.",0,1391310964,null,0,1391698021,0,cf4ufny,t3_1wghfs,t1_cf4ufny,t1_cf3op8x,null,1432213273,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
