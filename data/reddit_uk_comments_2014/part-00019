If your business is online, and delivers across the UK then go for it, implementing the bitpay payment processor is no more difficult than paypal.

To withdraw £ from bitpay though requires a minimum of £500 I think, but you can withdraw btc no problem to an exchange.

If however if this is a brick and motor store or local to one city then unfortunately I think it might not be worth your time till it becomes more popular, it is nice to have a sticker saying ""bitcoin accepted here"" though.

Accepting bitcoin will also get some some extra attention.

As for exchanges I'm unsure, I guess bitstamp as other mentioned but I use localbitcoin for speed.

2. Mobile Device Management and tracking software available for it would mean that if a device is lost or stolen it can be remotely wiped in fact one of these systems we use does a lot more http://www.vismo.com/
3. With a decent case they are pretty difficult to damage
4. People know how to use them

Overall they are pretty great and if you can get a relationship with a company to develop software for it you can have a good return of investment pretty quickly because of the ease and speed of use.

When news came out about the Sky buy-out, I got an email about some deals for switching over early.  Again, my future was a little bit uncertain at that point, but by the time I got a chance to look into it, the deal expired.  The quote I got last week is far cheaper than anything I've been offered before, and better than anything I've seen advertised elsewhere.  I'm not sure if that's an offer they extend to everyone (especially in light of Sky's recent bad publicity, as well as cheaper deals from their competition), or if it's because I've been willingly overpaying like a schmuck for the last few years.

Not entirely misleading.  The income you receive from that company is (if you're doing it right) is not employment income.  It's dividend income, and you would typically create a limited company with yourself as director to do it.  That means no NI is paid (employee or employer), and the income tax is, for a large portion, taxed at a lower rate than direct income is.

They certainly are ""avoiding"" tax by it's classic definition: legally organising your affairs such as to minimise your tax liabilities.

If they do get reclassified as employees, then IR35 rules will almost certainly mean that they would have _always_ been employees and will get back dated tax bills.  Tests that they weren't employees:

 - Sick/holiday pay?
 - Pension?
 - Used equipment paid for by the employer?
 - Went on staff parties?
 - Was continuously and exclusively employed for one task?
 - Standardised working hours when compared with other employees?
 - Chose whether they work or not?
 - Short period contracts with gaps between contracted periods?

I'd also check out the various Big Fat Quizes (some are better than others but all are decent) and maybe even Nevermind the Buzzcocks (although that's even more hit or miss).

As a very last resort, Was it Something I Said? is also on YouTube. I love David Mitchell and I think he's a good host (see The Unbelievable Truth, for example) but there's just something about Wisis? that doesn't quite work. Of course, it's only been on one season and the first season of Would I Lie to You? (a show that has subsequently become very good) was fairly bad as well. Part of that was because they replaced the random host with the always awesome Rob Brydon but I also just think it takes some time for these shows to get into the groove.

You're thinking of the Jimmy Carr avoidance method: you are not a director and the company ""loans"" you money instead of paying it to you.  In that case you take the IMHO huge risk that the company is issued a huge tax bill by HMRC, goes bust and your ""loan"" is up for collection.

Nonsense.  ""Moral"" is not a word that has anything to do with any of this.  If you really want to start talking morality with the tax system, then why is extorting-under-threat-of-jail any tax money at all ""moral""?  The crime of extortion-with-best-intentions is not really that pearly white compared to avoiding-extortion-as-best-one-can.

Most people who say things like that are usually using it as ""unfair"" (on their own private scale of fairness).  What is fair though is that these legal options are open to everyone.  Nothing stops you creating your own company and offering your services.

I sat once in R block last season. I get that people like the buzz from sitting among the most...""passionate"" fans, but I dunno...The guy next to me, who had his preteen son with him, spent the whole match spewing vitriol at both sets of players. ""Break 'is fahkin' legs"" is the one that sticks in my memory the most, screamed at high volume whenever Jordi Gomez got the ball after the Zamora red card. I fully endorse exposing kids to the tribal chest beating of a football crowd, but I thought it was a little weird nonetheless. I've heard of a couple of scuffles between fans and stewards in the PQR blocks. Like one of the mateys in that thread says, maybe these people prioritise using football as a cathartic outlet instead of actually supporting the team. They could do this in a more cost-effective manner by, instead of dropping 25 quid at QPR, spending a tenner [somewhere like Wealdstone FC](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAhEFuq62-I). Maybe they'd all be better off moving to X or A, where the opposition fans could galvanise them into directing their attention elsewhere.

That said, I'm quite happy with my seat in B, and I wouldn't want some toxic morons killing the reasonable vibe we have in B and A. At one point on Saturday Sombrero Man was regularly standing up and actually succeeding in getting us all to make noise. Without wanting to tempt fate, only once this season have I been sat next to some twats, and that was the Swindon game where I left it too late to buy my ST seat.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Let me turn to the topic of today's debate. I note that nowadays poverty comes in all sorts of technical categories. We have ""severe"" poverty, ""relative"" poverty, ""absolute"" poverty and ""persistent"" poverty, but it seems to me that, with our welfare system and the vast amounts that we spend on welfare in Britain today, there is no reason why any of our fellow citizens should be categorised as living in poverty. It is incumbent on us all to look at how we are spending our welfare budget. It is the poverty of aspiration and ambition, which is so pervasive and widespread among many in the lower socio-economic groups, that is the real problem. In that regard, I hope that perhaps my achievements can be an inspiration to others.

On a related note, the thinness of the squad has seen us too often playing players out of position.  Coutinho is not a left-winger, Moses was played in the middle (!) at the beginning of the season, and the experiment with Gerrard as a DM has not begun well, to say the least.  I also remember one game where Rodgers starts 4 Center-backs, Sterling at RB, etc.

All of which is a a round-about way of saying it has been a challenge to get the best ""squad"" together, rather than just trying to play the best 11 players.  For example, the best 3-man midfield so far has been Lucas holding with Allen and Henderson in front.  Not many would argue that Allen is better than Gerrard, but he ""fits better"" in a 4-3-3 system that emphasizes pressing, recycling, and possession.  

Salah, in my mind, would (ideally) open up some more tactical flexibility - specifically filling the LM position in a 4-4-2.  This may be especially important as there is no real DM position in a 4-4-2, so the absence of Lucas may be coverable by a shift in formation, rather than trying to fit a square peg (Gerrard, Allen) into a round hole

You need land to shoot on with permission, I was lucky enough to know someone who had a couple of fields and some woodland, make sure your shots won't go towards a busy road or garden/house though the range on an air rifle isn't much. I used a spring action .22 caliber air rifle (you break the barrel and pull it down to cock the rifle). Gas/CO2 powered rifles or spring powered are the most common, spring is easier to run since you dont have to dick about with refills or seals. .177 and .22 are the two common calibers (pellet size) for hunting you want a .22 for its increased weight and power. I always used the standard iron sights  but a sight can be fitted to most for more accurate shooting at little extra cost. Get the most powerful one you can without getting a license and don't cheap out (though don't spend a fortune)

My own experiences have been pretty good, sometimes lie down and wait for them or just walk and shoot as you spot, they will freeze up hoping you don't notice them and you can get an easy shot.

true,pairyhenis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire (Soton and a bit of Wiltshire),"&gt; How can you prove that allowing a persistence of illiteracy is not damaging someone's chances to find work

It's hard to prove that. But, it works both ways, and I don't think sanctioning the majority (who are out of work for a small amount of time despite their illiteracy/poor numeracy etc) to impact on the minority is the way to go.

&gt; Such as? I'd assume that anything like dyslexia will be taken in to account of course.

Nice assumption.  Forgive me if my faith in the inevitable private sector testing system is a little lacking.

Ultimately, such a policy is very likely to have no financial impact, given it's cost to implement on a national scale compared to the money it will save.  I question why we even need to brandish the stick of ""do this or lose your benefits"", given that individuals who really need these courses to find work would (hopefully) jump at the chance (provided the courses are up to scratch; again, not holding out hope).  These tests are supposedly to be given to fresh-out-of-employment adults, regardless of their previous employment history.  How patronising.

The mentality reeks of empty electioneering, pinned on the myth of the great unwashed doing anything they can to avoid an honest days work.

It was just another test. I think my parents were more interested in the test than I was. I just chugged along in my own little world and was a bit surprised later when everyone was getting excited about the results.

I was never particularly nervous of exams though. I could always just plough through like a machine and deal with each question, or quickly decide I didn't know the answer and move on to the next.

The actual test was different to any other exams I had done to that point and was very much like an IQ test for kids. I ended up failing by about 3 marks, any other year and I would have passed. 

Having looked around the Grammar (Boys) School for sixth form I didn't think I missed that much of an education. I think that some children do better in a selective environment but others will do better in a comprehensive.

British TV has a tonne of excellent actresses who happen to just look like everyday people. Olivia Coleman comes to mind (Peep Show, Broadchurch, Tyrannosaur, the first Matt Smith episode of Doctor Who) - she's one of my favourite actresses but she looks just like the average person, you'd see around.

So maybe, they're trying to appeal more to American audiences. That's just a theory though.

The other main reason would probably be the change in the production team. There's some quotes out there from Stephen Moffat on the casting of Karen Gillan, where he makes it clear that her looks were a big factor in the casting. She's also a good actress - so it obviously wasn't just that - but it seems like it mattered a lot.",0,1390234682,null,0,false,0,ceu98x7,t3_1vnbt7,t1_ceu98x7,t1_ceu62tq,null,1432024180,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,RedPartridge,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire to Rotherhithe,"For everyone fondly remembering back, in Warwickshire we still have the 11 plus so I took it about 10 years ago, as did my brothers and Warwickshire children to this day. 

The choices were pass and get into Lawrence Sheriff Grammar, top in the country for GCSE League tables twice in the past three years, or Avon Valley school, where the Headteacher was called a dictator by the papers, had multiple affairs, then burnt the school the fuck down. A friend having her head shaved in the toilet with a blunt razor was particuarly notable.  

I miserably, miserably failed the 11 plus. Massive blow to my confidence at age 11. Thought I was the 'stupid one' in my class. My parents got together the money and put me in one of the many, many private schools that exist in Warwickshire and the Warhammer loving, asthmatic me was a little less terrified of school. 

Went on to get a BA and an MA from top ten Universities, which I am very proud of. Still, I always felt it was hugely unfair, especially as the gap between the Grammars and the non-Grammars grew and grew, as one could select their students, and that Private Schools would crop up so lucky kids like me could pay their way to results. 

The 11+ system is broken, at least in Warwickshire. Seeing as one school has risen so high when, down the road, another fallen so low, and children being judged at the age of bloody 11 is just unfair. I'd love to see some data on how many private schools are in 11 plus counties also, as I'd put money it being higher.

Looking back, the system disturbs me a little, because at the time my parents (well, one of them) kept telling me it was important to go to the local grammar school and not to the secondary or the comprehensive.  
There was a real pecking order between the three (at least in my parents' view), and the grammar school I went to was considered the best academically, so there was a kind of social streaming going on.

I learned later that other countries had similar systems, with schools aimed either at academics or those with more practical skills. I can see the point of it, but it's a bit too Brave New World for my liking.

I suppose the school I went to served me well. The CDT facilities were not great, but maybe I just think that because I was useless at that stuff. I was always happier with my head in a book.

My SO has a real chip on her shoulder about that system, because she went to a comprehensive; she tells me I was let down by a school that didn't teach me how to mix with everyone and left me lacking in social skills. But I think I've always been introverted and socially inept – it wasn't the school.  
It's inverse snobbery on her part. I don't give a damn where someone went to school.  
I think she imagines I went around with my nose in the air assuming I was superior to the oiks from the comp, but it really wasn't like that. Many of the kids in those other schools I'd sat with and been friends with in Infants and Juniors. We just got split up at secondary age.

Even beyond that it would seem especially frustrating to sling that kind of money out on an attacker where we already have 5-6 players able to cover those positions when we're facing a crisis in midfield.

true,rct3wild,eng-lincolnshire,Lincolnshire,"The Grammar schools tend to focus on academic subjects whereas the Comprehensives focus on vocational subjects in order to play the league tables game. In this regard the tripartite system fails to provide an equal system where the same opportunities are available to everyone.

I think the actual system works well when not every town has a Grammar School. This means that the brightest of the bright get the best education possible and everyone else gets the education they want. The system that is used means that when there is less people in a year then the Grammar School will take the same number of people as they always do and then the rest will go to the local Comprehensive which essentially means that there is one less set. The year 7s in my school show this problem well. Usually we have about 4 sets per year but this year we only have enough students for 3. Whereas if you look at a county where only the top 2% go to a Grammar School (for example Essex) then the local comprehensives are not affected too much and the Grammar Schools are able to become some of the best state schools in the country (like Colchester).

The system also means that parents will coach their children to get into the perceived better Grammar Schools so that undermines the idea of the tripartite system, which was to provide the same opportunities to the poor as a rich person in a private school. 

The system also fails children who develop later who get stuck at the local comprehensive meaning that they do not get the same opportunities that a person at a Grammar School would get. The outcome is that people get stuck at a school that is failing them with no way out.

TLDR: Too many Grammar Schools causing all good schools to be selective.

---

&gt;

&gt;The **Virgin New Adventures** (NA series, or NAs) were a series of novels from Virgin Publishing based on the British science-fiction television series Doctor Who. They continued the story of the Doctor from the point at which the television programme went into hiatus from television[citation needed] (in 1989).

&gt;From 1991 to 1997, all the books except the final one involved the Seventh Doctor, who was portrayed on television by Sylvester McCoy. In further books published between 1997 and 1999, the New Adventures series focused on the character Bernice Summerfield and the Doctor did not appear. Like all Doctor Who media, the continuity of the novels in relation to other Doctor Who media is open to interpretation.

I had assumed, like most people reading along I'd guess, that Barage was talking about the party's national support. ""People were just shocked that an openly racist party even managed to get to 5-6%,"" he wrote - which was in the last European elections. UKIP, in comparison, he pointed out, is getting as high as 30%, nationally, in European election polls - which is a totally ""different kettle of fish"".

That seems about right to me. How does the fact that the BNP did much better than 5-6% in a couple of local isolated constituencies in troubled areas prove that wrong in any way?

There already is a cap on the market share of high street banks, so 57% of the population support something that already exists and Ed Miliband isn't going to touch.

Also, as an addendum, people should be wary of interfering with high street banks too much. I understand the outrage at bankers salaries, bonuses and the bailing out by the state, however providing high street banking services for individuals is very costly and barely profitable nowadays, and most banks make profit from the investment banking side of things. If we aren't careful they will do what banks in most other countries do, including most of Europe and the US, and start charging a monthly fee for having an account. We are lucky in the UK that the investment banking side of things essentially pays for us to have free current accounts.

I don't really understand what your analogy to the psycho and the nose was illustrating. Do you not think that this crime, in which the murderer (regardless of whether or not he's a psycho) believed that his victim was a pedophile, is different to one in which the attacker believed that another person had ""an offensive nose""? Even if you don't think that pedophilia is a justifiable reason to kill somebody, you must accept that there *are* people who do. Comparing that to the farcical idea that it could be justifiable to punch people because you don't like their nose just seems odd.

We aren't accepting a pseudo justification for his actions. They still carry the same moral weight. What we're doing is recognising why he did it because it's the 'interesting' part of this crime, the identifiable bit. That might not be particulary pleasant, when you think about it, but it *doesn't* mean we're judging the guy any less than if we called him 'Killer X'.

&gt;Much is made of the word's two spellings: whisky and whiskey. There are two schools of thought on the issue. One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word, indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer (like the difference between color and colour; tire and tyre; or recognize and recognise),] and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described. There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label, the spelling on the label should not be altered. Some writers refer to ""whisk(e)y"" or ""whisky/whiskey"" to acknowledge the variation.
The spelling whisky (plural: whiskies) is generally used in Canada, Japan, Scotland, England, and Wales—while whiskey (plural: whiskeys) is more common in Ireland and the United States. **The usage is not always consistent. For example, some prominent American brands, such as George Dickel, Maker's Mark, and Old Forester (all made by different companies), use the 'whisky' spelling on their labels, and the US legal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits document also uses the 'whisky' spelling.**

Secondary schools in Kent are split into grammar schools, and non-grammar schools. Grammar schools have the 11-plus entrance exam, and can (well, there are rules) choose who can attend the school, and so the pupils tend to do much better at exams. This doesn't mean that all the non-grammar schools are shit, but they will vary more than grammar schools, which have better results and the teaching jobs are more sought after.

Since you're coming from Canada, do know French? If you're fluent, then a native French speaker may go down well at schools.

true,cazza157,null,null,"* *Arming police destroys the model of policing by consent.*

Providing officers with the equipment that they need to deal with a lethal threat does mean that the population is suddenly being policed by force.

* *If the police carry guns so will the criminals*

The idea that it would spark an arms race is silly. When the police were armed with telescopic baton, CS or Tasers criminals did not respond at all by arming. Criminals already carry guns but to imagine there would be a significant increase to protect them against police is non-sequential as there would still be the legislation in place and thus the difficult of getting a firearm, and obviously the increased danger of carrying an illegal firearm.

* *They don't need guns because... TASER!*

Sadly tasers are not magic and therefore do not provide the best solution to lethal threat. If an officer was to draw a taser on a knife welding suspect who was charging at him and the taser failed (due to huge number of variables when using a taser) the likely hood is that officer is going to get stabbed.

&gt;[One officer used a taser on the suspect but it failed to have an effect on him, said Chief Superintendent Alex Murray. The policeman was knifed in the chest and stomach, around his stab-proof vest.](http://news.sky.com/story/1104229/mosque-stabbings-police-and-locals-heroic)

There are many other arguments I would touch on such as:  *It makes the police unapproachable*, however I need to eat. I may very well come back and edit this to include other points.

EDIT:

* *It makes the police unapproachable*

Initially maybe, people will have see the coverage on the news about it and this will most certainly have an effect. Also the first officer who needs to use his sidearm will be bring it all back into media spotlight. However apart from this it is unlikely that it would have an effect on the approachability of officers unless the public are type of people to physically vomit at the sight of a firearm, I'm sure most aren't. Being uncomfortable around firearms is mainly due to lack of education and exposure to correct usages of firearms. Right now I doubt most officers would even know how to safety check a firearm to ensure they could be handled safely.

It would it a while for people to adjust, but would it have an effect on the long term approachability? No. Who else are you going to call when someone assaults you?

* *Put out more ARVs (Armed Response Vehicles)*

Where seconds count, ARVs are minutes away. Generally when a firearm is needed they are needed immediately, scroll to my point on *But they'll hardly ever need it*.

* *Police have been unarmed for year, why change*

The unarmed bobby thing is a bit of a myth. Go back far enough and they were carrying cutlasses. In the 1950s and 1960s it was quite common for Bobbies to take a firearm from the station safe as they saw fit, just sign it out and sign it back in when you're done. If anything, today they are more unarmed than they ever have been. 

* *But they'll hardly ever need it*

Better to have firearm and never use it, then to need firearm and have it. They were ambushed and were let down by the powers at be.

&gt;[""Both officers were shot to the chest. The body armour they were wearing protected them and the bullets did not penetrate,"" Clarke said. The officers made a tactical retreat, Bone moving to the right – out of the line of fire – and her colleague turning to run up the path, Clarke said...](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/08/dale-cregan-trial-final-moments)

&gt;[...He went on: ""Cregan then turned his attention to PC Bone. She was trapped in front of the lounge and he discharged 24 shots at her. Some struck the officer, others the house. She managed to draw and fire her Taser, but it was discharged into a hard surface, probably the paving.](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/08/dale-cregan-trial-final-moments)

They had the chance to fire back, but were not provided with that which was required to do so.

* *We don't want to become like America*

The USA is a completely different culture regarding firearms to our own and this is one of the most infuriating arguments out there. While we share many aspects of our culture like general pop-culture, entertainment and so on firearms is something completely different. While in the US you can walk in to a gun shop and buy a range of weapons you cannot do so in the UK, and thus in the US they have a different method of policing because with 89 guns per 100 people your generally going to assume most people are armed.

The UK does not have this problem and it's not going change, US/UK is not a comparisons which should be bothered with. Look at other examples from perhaps the EU, such as Germany.

* *Police don't want to be armed*

Ibe - Sturridge - Aspas


Have Suarez on the bench in case he's needed. Alberto and Aspas need another run out. Sakho could do with a start, Gerrard and Sturridge could do with the time having just come back from knocks. Henderson needs a rest. Coutinho and Sterling also.

In an ideal world we are winning by 2 or more goals at the hour mark and can sub off a couple of guys and give a couple of youngsters a go. I doubt we do that though. Suarez will probably have to play a part.

&gt;**Laila Morse** (born **Maureen Oldman** 1 August 1945 in Dorking, Surrey) is an English actress, best known for playing Mo Harris in BBC series EastEnders, and Janet in the 1997 movie Nil by Mouth, which was written and directed by her younger brother, Hollywood actor Gary Oldman.

&gt;""Laila Morse"" is an anagram of an Italian phrase for ""my sister"" (Mia Sorella) – a name she got from Oldman's then girlfriend Isabella Rossellini.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I don't think anyone is right or wrong here, it's a bit of both.  Allen filled in really well at the start of last season.  But he was also far more familiar with how BR wanted to run things plus coming off the back of a really good season at Swansea + a string of great performances in the Olympics while everyone else needed time to get their shit straight, so his performances probably looked a bit better relative to the rest of the team and helped him stand out.  He's been deployed centrally in a deeper/holding role a couple of times this season in the absence of Lucas and not looked up to snuff.  

Can he do it? Yes, if we are desperate.  Is it where he's at his best? No, it isn't.  Stevie can't sit deep with him and Henderson would be wasted if confined like that too.  He's not going to bring any muscle or steel to the middle of the park either.  He's a nippy player though,  he isn't afraid to get stuck straight in, I love that about him.

We simply don't have anyone in our current squad who can be good, solid, reliable cover for Lucas.  Allen can sort of do it, but I know I don't want a midfield 3 of Allen/Henderson/Gerrard going up against midfields like Arsenal's or City's, it feels mismatched against us from the start.  While Lucas isn't the most physically imposing player out there he really doesn't get pushed around too much and can generally hold his own even against the more powerful players out there.  Allen on the other hand would just get tossed around ragged by the giants like Yaya, Mikel, Fellaini, etc.

I'm a big fan of Allen, I think he's still got a ton of room to develop and he's going to become an essential piece of our midfield.  I don't think his best position is in the holding role nor do I feel that he can do enough to justify being used as our sole cover there for an extended period.",0,1390244206,null,0,false,0,ceudkr6,t3_1vog6d,t1_ceudkr6,t1_ceub2sn,null,1432026303,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Anyway, to cut it short, he got me a job interview at Atkins Global over at Aztec West. Job spec looked good, telephone interview went well, and the physical face to face interview went OK. It went well enough that they offered me the job.

I was happy, accepted the role and mentioned that I will contact him in a few days once I've handed in my notice and got a final end date. 

He proceeds to ignore this entirely and *rings* my boss, who I was *talking* to at the time. He says to my boss ""I heard *freeatlast* was leaving and I'd like to offer our services to help find a replacement"".

I proceeded to put a formal complaint to his supervisor at the time - it was uncalled for and made me look a total ass to my current employers (who I had been with for 4 and a half years and built a trusting relationship up with). I had not handed in my notice, it was barely 2 hours after I spoke to him on the phone to accept the job offer. 

I do not know what the end result of my complaint was (evidently he was not sacked, he is still sending me emails offering me a new position), but Atkins Global revoked the job application because of this (Rob had told them there were ""teething issues"" as it had been a few days without a response from him, which I can only assume they took as me not actually wanting the job).

Due to this my new role no longer existed and my current employers now know I was looking elsewhere.

Can anyone explain to me why this is? It seems like people in the UK get super agitated whenever someone tries to sell their tickets at higher than face value. 

My family has had season tickets to the Texans (NFL team) since they were founded. We have good seats but we can't always go to the games since half of us have moved out of state at this point, but we keep the seats every year because it's a great atmosphere and we enjoy it when we do have the opportunity to go. When we can't make it, about half the time we just give them away to friends or family for no cost, and the other half of the time we sell them. When we sell them, we easily make 3-4x the face value because demand far outstrips supply for Texans tickets, and because our seats are very close to the field in a good area. Nobody even blinks over that...it's a free market, you get whatever people are willing to pay. 

So yeah, what's the deal over there? To me it sounds like you're getting a deal if you buy from this guy. Our stadium in Houston holds 70k+ people and face value for tickets in our section is close to $90, and we sometimes sell them for upwards of $300. Anfield has fewer seats and arguably much higher demand, yet face value to sit in the Kop is generally around 40-50 pounds and this guy's only asking double at most for some *really big matches*.

Is there any particular reason for this scepticism, as the data agrees pretty well with the census data? 21% in the census identified as N.

The 2011 census was the first one to ask that particular identity question, so we don't have time-series data to compare it to, but the NLT goes back a fair way, and suggests not a lot of movement here - A flat N. Irish identity among catholics, and a weak rise among protestants (representing maybe 5% of the total population?) over a period of nearly 15 years, even if we neglect the potentially suspect 2012 point.

Oxford's strange in that pretty much everybody participates in what outsiders looking in would understandably consider to be posh-wankery (e.g. formal dinners, May Balls, rowing, wearing academic dress to exams etc.). However, what's not apparent to people from outside is that the context in which this happens is rather socially egalitarian. Formals aren't something you do because you're posh, they're just an excuse for a nice (...) meal and some bevvies. Likewise, few people who do rowing at Oxford have rowed before. Most of the people in my club never did, and some (including me, both male captains and the boat club president) went to ordinary state-comps and just picked up the habit when we got here. 

There's enough normal and, crucially, international students here that you can easily spend your entire social scene hanging out with other people from ordinary backgrounds, if you so wish. Personally, I've noticed that the really hostile far-left opponents to these kind of egalitarian traditions (if that concept makes sense?) almost exclusively come from deeply privileged backgrounds, talk with cut-glass accents and have plainly never even considered the costs of making it through university. As someone who was pretty active in Oxford's political scene, I've never met anyone who agitated fiercely against Oxford as an institution who came from a similar background to most of my 'ordinary' friends at college. Never.

The Bullingdon-tier posh wankers exist, but they're a small minority in modern Oxford. The difference is what the actual posh wankers get up to is completely beyond the stuff which everybody does. The first example that comes to mind is I know a guy who was kicked out of a taxi for throwing money at the taxi driver and bellowing that he could buy the driver's entire family. Another was one who got kicked out of a Ball screaming 'Don't you know who my father is?!?'. [Likewise pretty much anything OCA do](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8870909/Oxford-Tories-nights-of-port-and-Nazi-songs.html) fits that bill. 

Communicating that there is this internal division between what looks to be posh but is actually just an Oxford tradition which has undergone social levelling, and the really privileged Oxford institutions and the behaviour of their members to people from outside of Oxford will be a huge challenge. Bear in mind that if you fail, some kid somewhere who is full of potential will watch your show and think to themselves 'Oxford's not for me' - and they'll never know that they were wrong. It's a heavy responsibility, but I support any initiative that could challenge the preconceptions potential applicants have about Oxford.",0,1390246667,null,0,1390247238,0,ceuergn,t3_1vmzhj,t1_ceuergn,t3_1vmzhj,null,1432026920,13,false,oxforduni,t5_2s4rg,13

---

&gt;

&gt;The **Battle of Rorke's Drift**, also known as the **Defence of Rorke's Drift**, was a battle in the Anglo-Zulu War. The defence of the mission station of Rorke's Drift, under the command of Lieutenant John Chard of the Royal Engineers, immediately followed the British Army's defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879, and continued into the following day, 23 January.

&gt;Just over 150 British and colonial troops successfully defended the garrison against an intense assault by 3,000 to 4,000 Zulu warriors. The massive, but piecemeal, Zulu attacks on Rorke's Drift came very close to defeating the tiny garrison but were ultimately repelled. Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to the defenders, along with a number of other decorations and honours.

Sakho on the bench to hopefully give him a good half an hour on the pitch to have him ready to start against Everton. If Flanagan is fit then swap Smith for him in order to give him a half an hour.

No change after that. 

Also with some of his picks he seemed to be trying way to hard at finding diamond in the rough players, trying to make something out of what turned out to be nothing. Yet at the same time I don't know how much of that is due to San Jose's FO or purely Yallop. He is the man who scouted De Rosario so there is that.

Unlike your mortgage though, if your earnings drop significantly, you have no risk of repossesion, debt collection, or a black mark on your credit file. 

And if you do end up well paid enough, you contribute more, which to me makes perfect sense. Those who benefit the most from there education, and those most able to do so, pay back more of their debt.

It's also worth nothing that while the cost has risen from £1.1K to up to £9k per year, so has the minimum earning threshold, and the period in which the loan will be scrapped is now 25 or 30 years, as opposed to at age 65, under the 1998-2005 rules.


I'm not a fan of the scheme, or the rules in which the loan apply. I think education should be free at point of access, but it's definitely worth people reading more into the detail of what the loan means and what options are out there.

&gt; 
&gt;  TV, ITV and many others have seen Starpath and have reported on it – all positive.  Therefore, with these trusted media, there should not be any doubt – Starpath is an incredible concept.

There seems to be a discrepancy between the reported views of the council and media companies and what local people actually say it looks like. At best the pictures seem to have used some artistic license. If it's really a wast of money then some civic minded Cambridge local (I'm not) could chase up the council. If it's just not quite as good as they make out I'd just like to know what it actually looks like.

In reality, if the outcome **is** a yes vote, then the ultimate independence settlement will also have to be inclusive of the (probably) ~40% of the population that **didn't** actually vote for it and wanted to stay in union.

This all represents part of the SNP strategy really - you want to (and indeed a lot of peoples natural response) is to try and put the yes and no campaign on equal terms as two separate but equally valid visions of the future - which is only true to some extent. Really it is only the yes campaign that offers a divergent vision of the future, and the no campaign is basically arguing on the basis of ""the yes campaign is ridiculous""... it might not be very positive or optimistic but they do have a point... by and large the yes campaign is a bit ridiculous. Just the other day I was reading a detailed defense analysis piece that literally tore the SNP plans for an independent Scottish defense apart. The highlight for me was their plan to base an air-force around the weaponised export version of the Hawker Siddeley (now BAE) Hawk Trainer (the same airframe the red arrows use). The only problem is, the top speed of the aircraft isn't actually even fast enough to intercept a commercial jet liner - let alone a fighter jet. People in the defense industry are literally laughing out loud at some of the plans they are so outlandish - its clearly been concocted by someone who knows literally nothing about air defense doctrine, with no military or industry background.

Putting all of the above to one side, I wouldn't be at all surprised if the ""first minister"" of an independent Scotland didn't end up being some center ground moderate with no SNP background. Because at the moment the only vision of independence you are hearing about is from the extreme end of people who really really want it.

It would be interesting to see what percentage of soldiers were injured (iirc it was aprox 5 million dead and wounded for France) and what the ratio was between people who actually fought and support workers, logistics etc; I think his comparison with the Crimean War was a bit iffy to me because the logistics and national mobilisation I don't think were comparable. Also the bit about how Versailles wasn't all that bad was weird because it was seen uncontroversially as one of the indirect causes of WW2 last time I checked (which admittedly was a few years ago), I don't think that the economic situation of France after 1870 and Germany after 1918 are comparable either.

My officemate has stopped his stupid 'eat shit all for two days' diet so he wasn't a whingey bitch today, which he usually is due to his chosen diet days (seriously, that 600 calories a day thing - awful diet - fuck off). 

It was an okay day. I managed to get everything on my (mundane, boring) shopping list except duct (or duck) tape, and am now cooking up a storm (or a pile of crap, remains to be seen).

I'd like to say to all chefs and cooks out there who write recipes in cooking books and on apps: I'd really appreciate knowing the cooking/prep time at the start of the recipe. Had I known it'd be near-on 5 hours I wouldn't have buggered around doing the washing and watching [a film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334649/?ref_=nv_sr_1) and I would've focused. I expect nothing less than culinary genius in my tummy in approximately an hour or else I'll be extremely pissed off.

Nouser's cookery tip of the day: when a recipe asks for apples quartered, cored and peeled, don't leave the peeling bit til the end, apples are slippery suckers and it ruins your nail varnish.

Now I'm off to [dye my hair again](http://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/hair-colour/all-over-color/casting-creme-gloss/460-cherry-red.aspx), this time it hopefully won't match my mother's dining room table. 

The film was alright and, folks, as I know you're all desperate to know, Friday's haircut was also alright. She spent 1.5 hours cutting it, checking I was happy, and even gave me wine. Bonus: it cost £40 less than my last cut. ",0,1390250563,null,0,false,0,ceugm5d,t3_1voi35,t1_ceugm5d,t3_1voi35,null,1432027745,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

I get that he fell for her, and she for him, but I don't like the ""happy ending"" for those two much. It just doesn't fit with The Doctor as we know him and I don't care if he is human. He's still The Doctor. He's still a Timelord, even if it's only in his mind and I cannot see him just settling for a human life for long even to oblige Rose. I think he'd be bored silly in a normal job, in a normal life given what he's seen and done. The Alt Doctor, he still has all those memories. He's not human in the sense that The Doctor was in Human Nature. He remembers who he was, IS. He might not be capable of regenerations but he is still a Timelord. &lt;&lt;&lt;

This isn't an argument it's an attempt at a thought terminating cliché. 

There is a proper debate to be had about fracking and it needs to not only take into account the science available for best practices and scenarios but also the scope of possibility for corner cutting and incompetence. 

Deep Sea drilling seems to be a less hazardous way of getting oil but even that has resulted in some large scale disasters and contaminations. Given the history of fracking in America some half arsed argument about how the oil companies will be more careful here isn't going to cut it.

true,Tbickle,flair1,,"""Levy claimed that the Bulgarian striker twice refused to play for the club in August, and also criticised the level of 'player power' in the game.

""We had a player in Berbatov who had refused to play two games for us, having a detrimental affect on the dressing-room,"" he said.

""We'd known for a year that the player wanted out of this club.

""The reality is that in modern football the players have all the power.""

Levy said last week that he felt no choice but to sell Robbie Keane in the summer, so he could fulfil his boyhood dream, but, when it came to Berbatov he said the club had just felt let down.
...
""We put him on the map, I think he's an outstanding player, but he signed a long-term contract with this club and I think he should have stayed.

""I had so many conversations with him. He kept saying it was about his ambition to play for Manchester United. It wasn't a money issue. We offered him a new contract and he wasn't even interested in discussing it.""


http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...v-was-sold-to-Manchester-United-Football.html








""Dimitar Berbatov has been locked in crisis talks over his future with Tottenham head coach Juande Ramos. It is believed Berbatov's agent Emil Dantchev was present at the meeting in London this morning as the Bulgarian tries to convince the club to let him join Manchester United.
The 27-year-old refused to play against Sunderland on Saturday because his 'head wasn't right' and Spurs have threatened to let him rot in the reserves if they don't get a high enough bid from United.""


http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ies-Spurs-crisis-talks-force-United-move.html







""The Spurs defender and his team-mates showed their commitment to the club last weekend, pulling together against Sunderland when petulant Berbatov allegedly refused to play.

The moody Bulgarian was angry at not being granted his move to Manchester United, a deal that is expected to go through this weekend. Asked if Berbatov's antics had done anything to dispel the negative, prima donna perception of today's stars, Woodgate said: ""In the eyes of the supporters, not really no.

""I give 100 per cent. No matter where I am. No matter which club I play for.

""I will always do that because I am privileged to be a professional footballer. You have to try as hard as you can every day.""

Former Spurs goalkeeping coach Hans Segers revealed in Mirror Sport yesterday that Berbatov was a ""moody loner"" who made life difficult for former boss Martin Jol before the Dutchman was sacked.""

&gt;History and usage of the term

&gt;In 1896, Democratic Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan made reference to trickle-down theory in his famous ""Cross of Gold"" speech:
**There are two ideas of government. There are those who believe that if you just legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, that their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it.**
&gt;The Merriam-Webster Dictionary notes that the first known use of trickle-down as an adjective meaning ""relating to or working on the principle of trickle-down theory"" was in 1944,[18] while the first known use of trickle-down theory was in 1954.[19]
&gt;After leaving the Presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, alleged **""Republicans [...] simply don't know how to manage the economy. They're so busy operating the trickle-down theory, giving the richest corporations the biggest break, that the whole thing goes to hell in a handbaskst.""**
&gt;Speaking on the Senate floor in 1992, Sen. Hank Brown said, **""Mr. President, the trickle-down theory attributed to the Republican Party has never been articulated by President Reagan and has never been articulated by President Bush and has never been advocated by either one of them.** One might argue whether trickle down makes any sense or not. To attribute to people who have advocated the opposite in policies is not only inaccurate but poisons the debate on public issues.""
&gt;**Thomas Sowell claimed that, despite its political prominence, no trickle-down theory has ever existed among economists.** In response, many critics referred him to Stockman's remarks to Greider. Sowell replied in his newspaper columns.Stockman himself had not proposed or advocated the alleged theory, so Sowell rejected him as an example of someone who had done so.

not to mention sherwood was very pleased with paulinho after the stoke game that i think he will start once 100% fit.

i see it this way though. sherwood sees that we have a big squad, and he is willing to let players fully heal up before putting them back in, which is fine by me. we have won 5 out of 6, have some really big games coming up where we will ned sandro, paulinho etc.

true,DHChemist,null,null,"Someone was telling me earlier about their LCB/RCB theory for Hughton's defence, which I should probably explain to put my comment into context.

Basically, when Hughton picks his CB pairings, he prefers the left sided one to be faster, with good awareness and better on the ball, whilst the right sided CB is tall, strong and tough-tackling. In this framework, Bennett and Bassong are LCB's, Turner a RCB. When through injury we're forced to pair 2 LCB's, we've generally not looked so good at the back.

From the looks of him, Ciani is in the RCB mould, making him cover/competition for the injured Turner, rather than direct competition for Bassong/Bennett. I don't know whether Ciani will be as good as Turner has been this season, so when Turner is back Ciani might find himself on the bench more. In the short term though, Ciani can be paired with a LCB to give our defence the balance that Hughton seems to like. In turn, that then pits Bassong and Bennett into direct competition, which should hopefully spur both of them on. Hopefully signing Ciani would then help give us two better CB's on the pitch, and with that balance look stronger at the back.

If the scenario was to arise where Bassong and Bennett are pitted against each other, I'd really like to see Bennett given the chance. He's young and will hopefully learn and improve from making mistakes, whilst Bassong makes just as many mistakes but doesn't seem to learn. Bassong hasn't been the same player this season, and whilst his pre-season injuries haven't helped, I think the captaincy has been the biggest factor in this. He's concentrating more on marshalling the troops, rather than on his own game, so he's making more mistakes.

What I'd like to see is Bassong stripped of captaincy and taken out of the spotlight for a bit to work on getting back to his best, because last season he was incredible. Martin is both defensively more solid and links up better with Snodgrass than Whittaker does, and has previously been captain, so I'd make Martin captain and try to play him more.",0,1390258384,null,0,false,0,ceukaox,t3_1voe3o,t1_ceukaox,t1_ceujye5,null,1435524726,5,false,NorwichCity,t5_2sv0y,5

High levels of wealth inequality are immensely problematic from an investment point of view - they drastically reduce where and how wealth can be invested, because there are fewer people with the wherewithal to consume what is produced.  Indeed, all this semi-directly contributed to the 2007 financial crisis - with those on the receiving end of excessive corporate profits scratching around for places to invest, lending vast sums of money at interest to underpaid workers who would otherwise have been earning this as wages had they been more closely related to productivity, this money being fed in at both ends to a property bubble, the financial sector creating speculative and esoteric derivative investment products, including CDOs etc.

The 'wealthy people are job creators' trope simply doesn't impress me.  Nor does the idea that capitalists are generally big risk takers, especially when one considers that, the richer they are, the smaller a proportion of their total wealth they are risking, especially in the light of limited liability.  Workers at a company risk far more, because when the owners and management fuck up they lose their jobs, homes, marriages, families, livelihoods, sanity, whatever, whereas, at the top end, the bosses and owners maybe get a smaller bonus and lose a fraction of that years' earnings.  This also applies more profoundly when companies outsource or ship out the entire business to the developing world where profits are greater.

Income inequality is a small issue beside this.

To this day I can't think of anyone who was more polite, friendly, and happy all the damn time. He used to pray in the shower room on his breaks. I remember how terrified I was upon seeing he was on my team, and how quickly this fear was dispelled. It was really quite something. I could talk about my same sex relationship with him, as he would discuss his girlfriend with me, and never once did he judge me. Always, always smiling. Always polite. Always friendly. In fact I got quite the crush on him by the time I left!

I always remember Ibrahim because he taught me a valuable lesson; a lifetime of rock hard prejudice can be shattered in a single instant, with the slightest of ease, and it can happen at any point. I've always second guessed myself since meeting him, and he's made it so much harder for prejudice to take root for me, and prejudice can so easily take hold of you without you even knowing it.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"Yeah, spot on.  I agree with all of this.

I'm tired of short-term thinking when it comes to players.  Signings like Dempsey, Siggy and Saha were never really long term players.  They come in late in the piece, might perform a very specific function for a short period of time, and that's it.  I just don't think it's the way forward.

It's one thing for Chelsea to sign Eto'o because he was cheap, because he is a legend of the game and a world class forward in his prime.  They won't get much out of him, but a hattrick against Utd is a job well done for Mourinho.

For us though, we need to be thinking longer term.  We already have two strikers in their late 20s... why not go for someone a few years younger?  Someone in the 23-26 age range is what's needed, not an old man with no interest in proving anything to anyone.  Even if Berbs somehow powered us to the Champions League with some vital goals, he's not going to be much use in that competition next year, is he?

And no I'm afraid it doesn't depend on your definition. It has a rather set definition, it describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs. Although some definitions also take into account wider feudal society e.g. peasants, clergy, etc... Thus you cannot call it feudal, as the system of landowning in the countryside was not feudal. It was based on tenants renting from the local landowner, not serfs labouring on his estates. Furthermore the gentry existed to provide an elite warrior group for the state so that blows the other major aspect out of the water. So while you final sentence is more or less correct you cannot call it the final stages of feudalism.

I'm always fuckin' with you haggis! ;-)

&gt;Wackawackapedia (which I trust completely) tells me Lenin was one of them reddish Commies, and it also tells me that commies are lefties. What are you on about?

As I hinted, I wasn't entirely serious, but - technically - Lenin was a conservative (Stalin even more so), who only flirted with leftist radicalism at a couple of points during his rise to power, as a form of populism, but ultimately always reverted to type.  He was always attacked from the libertarian left - sometimes noisily, sometimes nervously - by council communists, libertarian Marxists, anarchists etc.

&gt;You ain't colour blind to mix them up Dog, even if all you see is red.

You're right that Britain is different than America, but we're closer to them in many - even most - ways than we are to the continent, and that's a deeply mixed blessing.  Even if we conservatively call ourselves ""mid-Atlantic"" it's had a dramatic consequence for our adoption of some of the more disturbing aspects of neoliberalism.

&gt;Is it? I've only spent maybe 3-4 months of my life in Finland, but in my time there I did feel like Finland was a bit more left wing than Scotland, but not really that much more.

Really?  I've spent a bit of time in Finland too, and I'd say, up until fairly recently, it was solidly more social democratic than the UK - I wouldn't call it left, it's still a capitalist country.

Unfortunately, i feel SG just does not have the pace for this match anymore -- but we will miss his passing when he actually gets a second on the ball.

Really hope that Flanno is back (although I would prefer Enrique, but throwing him back in for this match seems unlikely even if he is ready).  Flanno played well in the reverse fixture and that was before he gained a bit of confidence in later appearances.  Sakho and Skrtel have the physicality to match up with Lukaku.  More room on the right flank could give GlenJo a bit more license to get forward.  His performances this season are so restrained that I feel he is getting instructed not to go forward so much.

Whether that's part of his game I don't know but in an actual human being to human being encounter he was funny, polite and dignified. The people in this video are far from it and the video now works in his favour. 
His bloody party however are such a shambles they make him come across in a bad light, if he's going to push for this UKIP thing then he needs to sort out the clowns below him. He is the brand of UKIP and his message is undermined by the dimwits. 
The other thing that has come from this is the idea of negotiating a better deal by the mainstream parties has come into context. I'm not sure about anyone else but I would of liked to of thought an ongoing parliament should always have and continue to seek the best options for their country in a union.

true,Wolf75k,scot-Aberdeen,"Aberdeen, Scotland","There's a list of them on the article posted... But basically the performance level of the British army (the officer caste to be more specific) is the main one. People have the idea that the horror of the war was the result of British generals being tragically inept and cold blooded with no understanding of what was going on in the front. There's also the idea that the Germans did much better than us and didn't make the mistakes British generals did.

These assertions discount the facts that a) every nation that fought in the war suffered horrendous casualties with Austria-Hungary, the Ottomans, Germany, Russia, France and Italy all losing more men and women than the British Empire. B) as the article mentions 17% of British officers were killed compared to 12% of soldiers and NCO's. Senior officer frequently toured the front (many were killed by artillery and sniper fire) and set up their bases far closer to the front lines than any officer would dream of doing today. C) the First World War was one of the most rapid periods of innovation the British military and the world in general had went through (many of said innovations went onto play massive roles in the development of modern warfare). The invention and use of tanks, the military application of aircrafts, the abolition of cavalry as a viable force in conflict and the adoption of small unit tactics all occurred during this 4 year conflict. Both sides on the Western Front were desperate to find ways of counteracting the trench deadlock and they succeeded. By mid 1917 they were beginning to get the hang of things and by the end of 1918 warfare had been changed forever.

To think that the officer of the British military spent four years sending endless human waves at the Germans while achieving nothing is a popular misconception, we've been taught it as kids and for many it's stuck but you won't find many academics at a college or university level that endorse it.

A baseball bat, machete, a knife a broken glass bottle etc are lethal. A baseball bat wielded by a fit young man is quite capable of opening your skull. Such should be answered with measured force. TASER is a good option, but it is not a guaranteed magic bullet. I have seen a man, armed with a knife fight though 9 separate TASER activations with no effect what so ever. In the end we had to take him down by bundling him with public order shields. A very risky manoeuvre. I would have preferred that we could have tried a baton gun first but none was available. Not to mention it would never be authorised. 

I personally believe that in those situations options such as AEP (baton gun), TASER and CS are good options but they do not always work and their unsuccessful usage can often cause the situation to go south, fast.

TASER is useful in more situations than you might imagine. They very often stop a conflict before it starts. I'd rather point a TASER at someone, they comply and no physical force be employed than the alternative. Interestingly if you point a can of CS at a suspect they often say ""Go on then."" point a TASER at them and they do what you say. Which is much safer for me, it's also much safer for them.

* something about the Anglo-Saxon period
* The Battle of Hastings

Yeah, because the phrase should really be the other way around....

""Successful job creators tend to become wealthy""

In order to become a job creator you need to have started a business and that business needs to have become relatively successful. Starting a business has certain levels of inherent risk.

If a small business owner fucks up then they not only lose their job, but also all their savings and possibly their house as well.

Most employers are small businesses, and most business owners own small businesses... 99.9% of UK businesses employ less than 250 people, 70% are either sole proprietorships or partnerships (IE the 'bosses' would be directly and financially liable if the business were to fail).

Dribble. Officers who are currently armed in London, respond on average to 12,000 calls a year, they open fire, on average once a year (excluding training/maintenance). If all officers are trained to the same level on Self loading pistols I hardly see that number going up significantly. Furthermore OST instructors constantly do analysis incidents where force is used.  They have found that officers do not use baton or CS nearly as much as they might. In situations where it is totally justified officers tend to avoid using those options. I hardly think a police force which is very conservative about using less lethal measures is going to start shooting people because they're a bit tricky to deal with. 

 ""lets take you're situation, you really think if all 9 of you had Glock 21's that man would be alive right now? because no offence but i certainly don't..""

My original assertion was not, oh we should shoot him, it was ""We need more options"" and less lethal options should, in such scenarios be backed up by lethal ones so that the option is available, so it can be used if reasonable and necessary. The other thing I was hoping might be taken from that was, TASER is not a magic wand. As I said, I think AEP would have been a good choice in that situation which would be safer than a shield charge and present minimal risk to the suspect. Again as above I do not believe he would be shot. Also there were more than 9 of us, more like 20. 

""and how do you think the youth of London and other cities will react to all police being armed? they'l see it as an escalation and ""if the police have guns as standard i need one as well for protection"" it's bollocks obviously but that's what they think ""

And where, pray do tell, are they going to get these firearms from? If you look at the vast majority of the firearms that are taken from London's streets, they're converted replicas, or museum pieces. That would indicate, unlike in the US for example, they're hardly available in abundance. Unfortunately those guns that are out there are still very deadly. Further a lot  of these kids don't carry knives, and unlike us they don't tend to have collapsible batons or CS spray. They don't seem to want to match like for like. 

I think a lot of people tend to forget that police are beholden to the criminal law and that is the final arbiter that decides if our actions are correct. If an officer opened fire unjustly, they'd be tried for murder. The consequences are such that no one is going to open fire and hope for the best. It is of course a tool of last resort but sometimes, unfortunately, it has to be considered. Officers are first responders and can walk into deadly situations unarmed. Dunno, I've been shot whilst on the job, once with a converted replica and once with an air pistol, maybe that has something to do with my perspective.

true,gega93,null,null,"Well, as much as we don't want Mata to leave, this could win us the title. They're a few reasons to sell him:

1. The doors  to the first team is more likely closed for him. In the last game he played, around 20th minute he won the ball back deep with a really awesome tackle, took the ball forward and conducted a pretty fast counter attack with Oscar or Hazard. The ball went out of play and the camera panned back to them, Mata was almost breathless, you couldn't see a sweat on Oscar. He's trying, but he doesn't look built for such demanding tactics.
2. World cup year - needs playtime.
3. We're not playing United anymore, They on the other hand are playing City and Liverpool at Old Trafford and Arsenal at Emirates. United taking points away from them may be crucial for our season. 
4. Mourinho mentioned it during his last post match interview that he considered them out of competition at this point, and with 13 points off the top, I do too, and since they won't be able to take points away from us this season, making them stronger should only help us. 
5. As for being left with only 4 Attacking midfielders, with Matic coming back, and Oscar's defensive contribution, he could acquire Lampard's old position in 4-3-3 and it could become our main system like Jose's first reign here, which would make the team a little more sound defensively as well. 
 
Obviously there's the issue of making them stronger for the future seasons, which Mata has quite a few left in him, but honestly, they're eventually going to get someone as good as him and a better fit for they're system anyway, they're still Manchester United, they're still a great club and a very rich one at that too. 

So yeah, selling Mata could be good for us, but then again, I don't know, just speculating. What do you guys think?

The guy is a natural born leader who knows how to rally his troops around him. The only former players who have beefs with him are because Mourinho broke the relationship down.

My point in saying that is because as we've seen, Mourinho loves Hazard. Hazard won't leave because Mourinho will convince him that the best thing for Hazard is Mourinho.

The other big reason I can't see Hazard leaving is because we have Thorgan. As long as Chelsea stay competitive on the European front, we have everything a player can ask for.

Mata on the other hand is a different story. Jose has pretty much made it clear he isn't a starter and Mata is a better player than that.

If I say Ireland, I mean the south. If someone says that something is produced in Ireland, or they're referring to the age of consent in Ireland or whatever, then I assume they mean in the R.O.I.

Bushmills could equally claim that their product is produced in Ireland or N.I. Either would be true in my eyes, *but* I would argue that it is more accurate today to say that it's a product of N.I. I can't really back it up, but most N.I produce that I've noticed will say 'Product of N.I' rather than Ireland, eg Sunblest/Ormo.

&gt; Have you genuinely been brought up to believe that you don't live on the Island of Ireland

No, it was simply a matter of most people using Ireland as shorthand for Eire/R.O.I. I don't have anything against the notion of the I.O.I. I live on it. I find that in conversation it is often necessary to be distinct about which jurisdiction one is referring to, so I generally use Ireland/Northern Ireland in those instances.

Ever since Mata was subbed for Oscar (The game where Mata was supposedly furious with the substitution) we have always lead the game before a substitution was made. Hence there was no need to play an attacking player in. All the subs made were either to defend the goal or because someone had got a knock.
Similarly Cole has been good in the games he played, but Azili has been exceptional at the same position hence he is being kept out. Why is it that we are ready to accept Cole being kept out but not Mata?
Is it because we love the guy(Mata) that our personal affection for that person is overshadowing what it does to the team?

Lucas does very well defensively but doesn't offer much going forward, Gerrard does very well going forward but showed he's not entirely capable of holding down the middle on his own. Also, both of which are very injury prone, and Gerrard is aging. We'll need to find a replacement, Matuidi with contract expiring and contract not signed (I've heard of the agent dispute but still no new contract) or M'Vila for 12€ isn't bad. Matuidi is experienced, M'Vila can be the future. Fuck man, sign both and let's challenge for the title. 


Also, Agger and Sahko as our center backs (two right foot cb's play together all the time. Left foot won't change shit). I'm not sold on Skrtel at all. He makes great plays for us time to time but he's also a huge liability. Our outside backs have been sketchy as of late but once everyone is fit it should be enough to get us through this season. I'm not opposed to Montoya/Danilo or Alberto Moreno either. All of which would be able to play upon arrival and be in and out starter within the next year to two.

I'm happy to tie up £50k ($75k policy will be in USD) into it if it is going to grow at a decent rate and there are not some hidden charges or stipulations I should be aware of.

I understand the fee is 1% P.A for 10 years but this can be 1.25% over 8 years which for me makes more sense as the policy will go up in value so having the fees over 8 years reduces the amount paid?

The bond also has a quarterly fee of £96 fixed for the life of the bond.

Basically I suppose it seems like a smart idea and has many tax benefits, I am just cautious that there is perhaps something I am overlooking.

I do not plan to return to the UK for the next 10 years, if EVER.

Realistically I plan to be in a position to contribute $50k-$100k a year into this bond for the next 10 years and be looking at a valuation of $1m-$1.5m and allowing me to take around $40k-$60k a year from that at a SWR of 4% allowing me the option of retirement or atleast financial independence.

I plan to retire to the Far East (Philippines/Thailand/China) in the next 15 years or so, if all goes to plan.

*Pros of offshore bond*
It can effectively follow you wherever you go, so you shouldn't have to worry about living in different countries and still making contributions to the bond 
If you eventually return to the UK and encash, you will get a reduction on the eventual gain for every day you spent outside the uk. If you don't return to the uk for the life of the bond it means you won't pay tax on final encashment.
If you die as a uk-dom you will be assessed for inheritance tax on your uk assets only - this excludes offshore investments 
Offshore bonds benefit from gross roll-up - this means they can grow in a tax advantageous environment (however this can be reduced if you invest in foreign equities)
There are quite big advantages of holding on offshore bond compared to an onshore bond if you hold it for 10 + years
Two downsides of holding an offshore bond are if you want to hold it for a short time period or if you want to live in the uk for most of the investment term. 
Neither of these seem to apply in this case

*Cons of offshore bond*
Fees are likely to he higher compared to a comparable onshore investment - this includes the product itself and paying for adviser fees (as this is a more complex product)
You will have to keep updated with tax rules in whichever country you eventually encash in. They may have very different rules compared to the uk
They are overall more complex basically

*Pros of Skandia product (compared to other offshore bonds)*
You can hold a wide range of investments in it, which is good if you want the flexibility to change investment choices 
Overall a good investment platform in my opinion

*Cons of Skandia product* 
You can almost certainly get a cheaper product if you feel you don't need wider investment choices. ",0,1390295960,null,0,false,0,ceuygm7,t3_1vqy1x,t1_ceuygm7,t1_ceuy87a,null,1435524276,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

I mean I wouldn't quite call it extortion, but the prices are damn ridiculous. You can pay £250 per car for what is essentially a taxi ride from the house to the crematorium and then there's the vastly inflated cost of the flowers, and the service cost, and the cremation cost and the urn ( read cardboard tube ) and the headstones ( if you want it ) and the coffin and the embalming and death certificate and the reception and the catering and all the other admin costs. 

I worked out ( because I asked how many funerals the company did a week ) that the company who buried my girlfriends mum were turning over roughly £100,000/week for 4 funerals a day. Sometimes more. 

That's quite a business.

The higher fees compared to an onshore product should be offset by the tax advantages (correct?)

And the higher fees of the Skandia product are for access to a wider range of investment options compared with other products.

These data, whilst accurate, are somewhat misleading if you consider how much of the economy is controlled by large scale enterprise and multinationals (rather more than half in the UK iirc).  SMEs dominate in terms of numbers of businesses, unsurprisingly, and numbers of employees, but large scale enterprises and transnational corporations dominate in terms of turnovers/profits, etc.  Small businesses buy many of their inputs from MNCs and sell many of their outputs to them.  

So consider the difference between small and large enterprises, in small businesses the owner often works alongside their employees or at least acts in a managerial role and, to that extent, they're acting as a worker rather than a capitalist.  Actual capitalists don't get their hands dirty with labour, they derive unearned income from investments, and in large scale capitalist corporations the owners are shareholders, the most significant of whom do no labour in and often never even visit the companies they own, instead using managerial proxies. Multinationals rarely take significant risks, that happens down the chain, and they dominate markets and legislative frameworks to maintain their positions of dominance.  And this situation is growing worse, because this is what capitalism does best - to trend towards concentration and monopoly.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;People have the idea that the horror of the war was the result of British generals being tragically inept and cold blooded with no understanding of what was going on in the front. There's also the idea that the Germans did much better than us and didn't make the mistakes British generals did.

I'd certainly subscribe somewhat to the first one, although not to the second, and it's definitely been overplayed.  There were many issues which led to the carnage of the fronts and bad general-ing was only one of them.  Another obvious one was the development of technology to a certain point and no further at the beginning of the war, however, there had been chances to realise the likely consequences of this before the first shot was fired.

&gt;as the article mentions 17% of British officers were killed compared to 12% of soldiers and NCO's

'Officer' takes you down to 2nd lieutenant in the army, I'd like to see this broken down a bit before I'd give it much significance.  It wasn't the 2nd lieutenants who were being particularly charged with incompetence, cruelty and cowardice.

But in general, if, as you and/or the author claim, there's a widespread and overly simplistic view that bad leadership was the sole case of our enormous casualties, and a frankly wrong belief that we were unique in this regard, then I agree it's a myth which needs to be dispelled.  However, I think most people's understanding of the First World War is more nuanced than that, even if it isn't as gloriously convoluted and complex as the war itself.
